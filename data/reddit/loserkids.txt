Who resolves your dispute in a non-multisig transaction? ;)
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:53:44
"**Multi-sig Hot wallet**
Provided by **BitGo** (BitGo FAQ)"
I'm pretty sure they HAVE.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:12:17
I know, I'm just saying you can't compare gox actions with stamp's. Both are insolvent but only one went through proper bankruptcy procedures.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:09:52
SELL so I can buy some cheap coins.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:04:56
According to bfxdata.com there were around $40M in swaps. I don't know how much crypto they have/had.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:11:15
Everybody end up bailing out BTC holders, not just you. Anyway you can't compare these two events because this is a centralized decision of an exchange market which none of us can change, unlike ETH fork which you voted for with your PoW.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:58:20
Technically, they lost THEIR OWN coins. Bitcoins are only yours if you hold the corresponding private key. I wouldn't be surprised if a similar statement was in their TOS.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:27:40
They have an offshore company in Hong Kong with bank accounts in Taiwan. You're not allowed to have a biz account here in Taiwan unless you have a local biz license which I don't think they have. In that case money sits on their individual accounts which aren't interesting for the government if the owner is a foreigner (which he is) and money comes from abroad (which they come). In other words bitfinex CEO might have already fled Taiwan with all the money.
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:00:24
Why would you hold anything with them anyway?
@_date: 2016-08-28 15:26:26
Why don't you buy ~$60 rpi3 and connect 256GB USB (about the same price) to it?
@_date: 2016-08-02 15:07:44
I thing it doesn't have any effect on the price. It's probably just Bitcoiners buying ETC.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:43:22
It's better than asking the government to bail them out tho.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:58:34
Doesn't Bitfinex hold 2 out of 3 keys? In that case BitGo doesn't have to sign anything. If that's not the case why doesn't the user hold at least 1 key himself?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:52:51


1. how can you handle OTHER PEOPLE'S money this way when it's only you being responsible for a shitty security? What you're trying to do is a theft.
2. are you as a company putting your own money on the table too??
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:55:39
Individual accounts weren't compromised, but individual wallets were.
In case they go bankrupt you're right, they will have to socialize losses (and everyone that will file a claim will gets back anywhere between 0 and 99.99%). 
But if they call it a day (and back it up with their TOS which everyone agreed to and says you're responsible for everything) and they continue operating, then no socialization of losses will occur and affected traders will have to fight it on their own or collectively.
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:52:43
Tuesday is when the bitfinex hack happened. Just saying...
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:22:02
You have to be very desperate and naive to believe Bitfinex will make up for it in the future. They simply don't care about you. 
I always wondered why the fuck Bitfinex uses Taiwanese bank accounts for deposits. But living here in Taiwan for some time I get it now. If you're a foreigner the government nor a bank couldn't care less about foreign deposits even if you've opened an individual bank account (you can't have a business acc without owning a biz anyway) and handle millions of US dollars. You as a foreigner (and it helps a lot if you don't have any residency here) can do whatever fuck you want unless you hurt someone, or do drugs. I bet my underwear the CEO already fled Taiwan with all the fiat money without authorities giving a single fuck.
I may be wrong but a French dude with an offshore in Hong Kong and (very likely individual non-business) bank accounts in Taiwan is sketchy as fuck. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:18:15
Doesn't Kraken do the same?
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:04:30
You're right. The thing is they can't (AFAIK) legally socialize losses without filling for bankruptcy. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:20:00
I think the CEO isn't that saint after all. I could never understand why would you have bank accounts in Taiwan with an offshore in Hong Kong if you're not a Taiwanese citizen. [This]( is one of possible explanations.

"Buying" and "selling" is done off-chain. The only situation where the user ever needs to bother using his/her keys is while depositing and withdrawing the crypto.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:09:51
LOL you won the Internet today.
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:53:49


Yes, I will sue them (hopefully in a group lawsuit) and also report them to HK cyber crime bureau if I get any haircut (I'll probably report them anyway because somebody will definitely lose their money because of their /bfx/ incompetence).
No trader and definitely no liquidity provider should bear the cost because some retards put all users' bitcoins in hot wallets. You have to be a computer illiterate and have IQ below 100 to do such stupid shit. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:05:55
I'll be selling mine for 1BTC/token :P
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:26:01


Wrong. That means they had about 350k BTC worth of liabilities (denominated in BTC, USD and shitcoins).
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:05:46
How much of Bitfinex's own money is going to be put on the table?
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:09:06

You only prune the blockchain data (blocks and their metadata), this setting has nothing to do with UTXO set.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:21:51
You're right, they can also face future lawsuits (I'm pretty sure some big creditors are already prepared for this scenario) and risk losing even more money and go bankrupt afterwards as a protection against more creditors.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:29:36
Can they "freeze" it? I thought bitfinex has 2 out of 3 keys.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:13:15
I hope so, but for now I take that money as being lost forever.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:31:15
They're there just for dirty jobs. We had such guy in a bank that I worked for. Cops are all over him now making the real decision makers safe and sound.

If nothing else, they claim they are endorsed by bitcoin.org which is a [lie]( It also claims bitcoin.org as their homepage which is an obvious bullshit as people behind bitcoin.org haven't developed any iOS wallet.

3rd party arbiters are widely used in OpenBazaar. I've even moderated some cases myself and there were 0 problems.
AFAIK there will be a reputation system for arbiters in bitsquare in the future.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:31:58
That's of course expected because your employment status doesn't give you any privilege in this particular case. But that wasn't the question.
The question was, how much (if any) of the company's assets will be used towards their creditors?

@_date: 2016-08-05 23:11:31
Sure, I expect seeing $0 anyway. I'm pretty sure the CEO is long gone with all the money.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:59:31


And you believe that?
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:50:46


A decentralized environment doesn't mean there can't be any rules or limits. A decentralized environment means that IF/WHEN you choose to use the service, you're an equal part of the network as everyone else and if you decide to create your own network there's no one to stop you.

:D that was a good one
@_date: 2016-08-28 15:23:24
prune=550 means the pruned chain will have ~550MB (little more than that).
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:34:54
Perhaps they want to start a heated discussion about it in the community so they have plenty of time to hide their asses. I mean even if you're a tech guy (I'm one myself) you can't be that retarded to think you can just redistribute what's not yours (unless you're a government). They have no legal ground to socialize losses unless they go bankrupt. That's business 101
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:12:15
They filed for bankruptcy. Bitfinex has not.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:04:37
You have to be out of your mind if you want to keep doing business with them. I guess people never learn...

He wasn't tweeted about Bitfinex hack particularly tho.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:22:20
It would be, had users held at least 1 private key and every single withdrawal/deposit would be signed by it and a cosigner, be it finex or bitgo.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:18:15
They will eventually go bankrupt anyway because lots of people want 100% of their money back not 64% and will sue the shit out of them.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:20:18
The price already went up a little so I think they're slowly buying back with other people's money.

I'm a foreigner without a residency. If i get fucked over by another foreigner the government won't do shit - that's how it works here. I'll have to legally solve this in Hong Kong where the company resides and they can't do anything with Taiwanese bank accounts. These guys knew what they were doing..
Either way I'm waiting for them to bring up their website to see the loss. Then I'll figure out my next steps. I'm for sure filing a cyber crime report in HK.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:03:37

Why don't you short it then if you know what's gonna happen? Easy money.
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:41:49
It's not logical, nor fair and it's defenitely not legal. Their customers' assets aren't owned by Bitfinex and they can't just redistribute it willy nilly. 
AFAIK money were stolen from INDIVIDUAL wallets (that's how BitGo was implemented there) and those that lost will probably have to settle with Bitfinex individually. We'll see what's gonna happen next couple of days/weeks.
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:33:20
I could withdraw a very small amount of ETC (less than 100). Larger sums are being processed...

I totally agree. Had the company gone properly bankrupt tho these clowns would be out of the business which is where they belong.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:07:20

@_date: 2016-08-05 16:58:19
Even if you're the stupidest shit in the world (i.e. having shitloads of money on a centralized market) it doesn't matter Bitfinex thieves can just willy nilly redistribute someone else's money. That's a theft.

When DAO hack happened I was like "fuck it, let them lose their money". After Bitfinex hack (and I had +$5k there and some ETC), I'm still like "fuck it, let us lose some money".
I hope nobody fucks up Bitcoin long-term for some bad short-term market choices.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:54:59


Called profit + you get to keep all your shitcoin. The coins will lose value regardless of your action but you can grab the opportunity by the balls and make some extra... or keep whining about it.. 
Lots of us will get hit by this bitfisocialism but why not getting the most out of it?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:34:25
I see your point now. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 06:34:17
RPi3 is significantly faster than RPi2 though. Of course, you need to play with bitcoin.conf a little because 1GB RAM isn't that much but my set up eats around 50% of memory and 4-20% CPU with ~20 active connections (max is 35 in my set up). 
I wanna test running a full node instead of pruned one to see if the performance is drastically decreased but so far it looks fine.
Yes, the initial chain verification takes forever (~3 weeks) but once you get past that, it performs well.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:58:26
An arbiter in a multisig tx can't run away with your money (unlike a centralized market, which happened a lot in the past), he can only release or not release them. If that happens you can go back to the counterparty and at start negotiating to get at least something back. When a centralized market decides they are closed, then they are closed and you can do nothing about it.
@_date: 2016-08-29 11:50:03
But again the UTXO set has nothing to do with blockchain itself and isn't controlled by prune option in any way. Prune=XXX only controls the size of /blocks folder, so saying "*The pruned blockchain will be about 2.5 GByte*" is wrong. 
Anyway, it's just a term issue so no need to argue about it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:09:22
I don't think socializing losses is the way to go. Better than bankruptcy, though...




What stops me from selling BTC for LTC and then withdraw it to safety? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:25:30
My point was gox needs to legally socialize losses among all their clients BECAUSE they went bankrupt. Bitfinex probably CAN'T legally do the same UNLESS they go bankrupt.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:06:36
I doubt they will pay the rest later. They've proven they don't give a shit about you. The way they phrased this whole bullshit seems to me like they aren't even putting their own money on the table. Even tho it's their own fuck up and they're the only to bear the cost.
@_date: 2016-08-06 06:29:43
That's why you do a proper risk management and figure out how many coins need to be on hot wallets with the rest sitting in $99 Trezor.

@_date: 2016-08-03 02:35:02
What I don't understand is why on earth they need to hold 2 out of 3 bitgo keys. At least 1 if not 2 keys should be held by the user.
If they don't socialize loses with my USD, I'm buying bitcoin and off to [bitsquare.io]( 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:08:36

Bitstamp's hack was 10x smaller tho.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:42:36
Owner's assets have nothing to do with this. LTD right behind the name of the company means that they're only liable up to the value of company's assets.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:13:52


Not to creditors that weren't directly affected by the hack tho. I get your feelz but there are people losing money in favor of someone else. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:33:05
$40M was just in swaps. Me personally I had around 30% left aside to catch Bitcoin dips. I think there is more fiat on Bitfinex "just waiting" than the stolen amount itself (but that's just a wild guess). And if they really have +1M BTC + shitloads of other cryptos then it really won't be that painful. I hope they won't socialize losses though.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:59:32
Actually it's [this dude]( enjoying your money.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:48:05
I know the risk of course. It still doesn't mean they can legally treat their clients money as their assets. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:08:16
I think none. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to socialize losses. I'm not a lawyer but logic tells me they would need to wait for the end of the investigation.
Of course they need to file for bankruptcy if they are insolvent anyway. 
I think this is all bullshit so they have little more time to hide.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:18:28
I'll answer for them.

@_date: 2016-08-05 23:10:10
I'm mot sure. From my experience there aren't many Taiwanese that actively hold/trade bitcoin and those that do use 2 local markets: bitoex.com and maicoin.com
I also think that deposits from Taiwan didn't go to Taiwanese bank accounts but elsewhere (I think they also had accounts in Europe and the US).
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:15:29
I hope you also realize that you shouldn't be trading what you can't afford to lose. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:34:15
Getting your funds stolen because an incompetence of whoever runs this bitfinex joke and losing money trading are two different things. I've lost and earned a lot trading and it doesn't do anything to me, but having my lended USD redistributed for arbitrary reasons pisses me off. That's a theft.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:21:38
100% socialism benefits me as a USD lender but I don't think it's right at all. Hopefully, they go bankrupt (and possibly end up in jail) after everyone withdraws what's left (if any - I'm still skeptical we'll see anything).
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:02:02
Those types of tx are done off-chain so you don't need to be around when that happens. 
Also it doesn't matter at what time a cosigner signs his part of tx. You sign it first, go to bed and then he cosigns when needed without you having anything to do with it.

Also, some notes as I'm going through the app.
1) would be nice to be able to set which screen is the default one. Most people probably don't want to see prices for all cryptos first (I definitely don't)

Yes, and they'd be also growing their UTXO set and chain data 8x faster. 
And what happens when most of the mining reward is gone? Will they add more space (linearly)? How far will they go to keep tx fees low? 10GB blocks? 100GB? 100TB?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:24:51
The worst case scenario, you can open/close LN channels with Litecoin and then do a cheap atomic swap for BTC.
Anyway, I think that after all the optimizations are done (mostly Schnorr sigs and perhaps MAST) blocks will get eventually larger. There's just no reason to make them large now and then wondering how to optimize the mess later. It could bite us in the ass.

Mining centralization: Only the wealthiest miners/pools with the biggest bandwidth and fastest internet speeds would be able to download and broadcast blocks fast enough. It's funny that Chinese pools push for large blocks because any traffic coming via the Chinese firewall is unbelievably slow and they would suffer the most.
Network centralization: the node count would likely drop sharply due to the growing cost especially when it comes to RAM (UTXO set) and bandwidth which is still shit in most of the world, the first world included. 
Even if the node count stays the same, only big companies, wealthy miners etc could afford to run validating nodes which would give even more power to big pools.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:03:15


It's not about the storage at all. The real concern is the growing UTXO set. There's no real progress technologically or price-wise when it comes to RAM.

When I woke up, Shitcoin Cash was already falling and after a short chat with someone that has been in crypto since the early beginning, I got back to my senses.

Bitcoin is light years ahead of every other crypto. Those other communities have no clue how nasty the environment can get, what it means to waste time with bullshit politics for years, they never experienced high fees or clogged network, media which-hunting etc. Bitcoin has survived/is surviving everything that is thrown at it, but will others be able to do the same? We have yet to find out. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:00:57
There is some overlap for sure, but the absolute majority of crypto folks joined us this year. And they will learn the hard way.

I believe it's not up to nullc (or any other Core dev) to "consider bigger blocks". Core devs can only propose a code but at the end of the day, it's ultimately users (and miners and businesses and everyone else) deciding what the protocol looks like.

I'm running a Bitcoin node, ElectrumX server and Monero node and the HW was below $500 (Intel NUC i3, 1TB HDD, 16GB RAM). The connectivity is around $40/month and the electricity cost is negligible.
LN node shouldn't be any more resource-intensive than that.

Nobody uses those. Once someone does, they will have the same scaling issues, high fees, and politicized debates for years like we do. Block space is a scarce resource if you want to preserve decentralization. That's just how it is.

How many UTXOs are you spending at once? I never paid $20 in fees and I'm transacting numerous times a week. Sounds like you either have tons of tiny UTXOs or your wallet fee estimation is broken. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:56:57
I use Trezor and Electrum all the time and never paid that much. The highest fee I paid was $7 (a tx with 6 inputs and 2 outputs) and the longest a tx was unconfirmed for was 8 hours. Most of the time it’s quick and cheap with the only exception when mempool is at +100k txs.
Sure the problem exists but whoever pays $20 for a standard 1 out 2 in tx is massively overpaying.

@_date: 2017-12-19 11:04:26
Personally, I rarely move less than $200 worth of BTC so I don’t care about ~$5 fees that much. Those that do care will have to wait for LN or start using altcoins I guess. There’s not much to do about it right now especially as those that “pollute” mempool the most (big web wallets and exchanges) refuse to implement SegWit which could make the situation a bit better even for legacy txs.

My source is not very reliable, but from what I heard Chinese can take/send their money to Taiwan and buy bitcoin in convenience stores (which I did myself many times before - it's quick and easy). This source also told me they come to Taiwan with shitloads of gold, sell it and buy bitcoin.
I really don't know if that's true but from my experience almost nobody in Taiwan knows about bitcoin yet there are ~10000 places to buy it. If Taiwanese don't use it then I suppose Chinese do.

I'm also thinking about a physical vault hidden somewhere with a portion of the seed stored there?

... as well as with full nodes propagating miners' blocks. As soon as miners try to force protocol changes (and fork the network), it won't be understood (and will be rejected) by the majority of full nodes using the older protocol version. 
Not to mention, if majority of hashing power tries to do something malicious (not necessarily by trying to change the protocol), bitcoin developers may change its PoW algorithm and from there it's up to full nodes adoption, to get miners out of business (or at least out of the network).
Either way, Bitcoin is decentralized because it has no single point of failure. Therefore, I disagree decentralization has to do *exclusively* with mining power. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:31:00
It's not so simple. 
Bitcoin core initially gives you 100 public/private key pairs and their corresponding outputs. When they all become used up (funds are sent to those outputs, outputs are spent etc.) a new batch of keys is created and stored in wallet.dat.
When that happens, you have to make sure to backup the file again, otherwise, you will lose access to those newly created outputs and the ability to spend them.
If you can afford to dedicate extra resources on your computer, you can run bitcoind as a node only, install electrum server that uses bitcoind data and use Electrum wallet to connect to this server. This way you get the extra data security of running a full node and convenience of Electrum that supports BIP 39 (mnemonic seed).

Let's say what you say is right. But there are 2 very important things to keep in mind:
1) there are probably tens of thousands of miners. Just even a few Bitcoin devs can't collectively decide what their next steps will be, let alone thousands of miners. Each and every one of them has different needs and goals
2) it only takes one fundament (e.g. a viral news about miners raising their rewards out of thin air) and bitcoin may flash crash to double digits before miners even think of selling
This a decentralized system and this kind of (centralized *) thinking doesn't apply to it very well.

@_date: 2016-03-25 11:52:02




I hear you, however I'm not really sure (I don't take anyone's side), if what you get by changing just a single parameter (which wasn't even part of the initial protocol to begin with) is an altcoin. 
However decentralized systems don't give a shit about anyone's opinion, that's why I strongly disagree such behavior, which you're talking about, is destructive. This is free market, money talks and "classic coiners" are on the shorter end of the stick. It's all that matters in this debate.
I don't agree with their "violent" tactics though, especially when people like Gavin and Roger Ver jumped on the bandwagon but again, decentralized systems simply don't care. No single person is important.. no single point of failure.. I think bitcoiners give them too much attention for nothing (unless ofc you're a trader and you really on short term profits).

The only reason I'm willing to take the risk is, that as a front-end developer I can always earn that money back if things go south.

I agree. Maybe I should make it clear in the beginning I was talking about devs implementing SegWit as a hard fork. From what I understand soft forking in this case requires lots of "hacking" which is always bad for those that didn't write the code but have to work with it at some point later. Which is basically anyone.


They disagree on technicalities and they are probably right about it. But I think they are completely clueless when it comes to economics. I have a feeling they want to be too technical on things that aren't technical at all. For example them spreading FUD about ultimately having two different coins after the fork. That is very likely to happen technically speaking yet very unlikely because of [everyone being in it for profit]( The market would solve this issue the second everyone would start losing money. I think it actually wouldn't hurt if bitcoin developers read some Mises or someone else. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:29:30
When adjusting per each stuck transaction you're responding to a current market situation. You're setting the fee only for transactions that need it. 
When adjusting globally you have no idea what the price will be far in the future. If every penny counts for you, you may end up checking the price all the time just so you don't overpay/underpay the fee if the transaction gets stuck.

Yes, but it doesn't fire automatically when the network is clogged. Electrum doesn't even **explain** that this feature exists and that it should be used in certain circumstances. For many, it's simply non-existent. It also doesn't warn you when the fee is too low and you very likely won't make it into a block. 
I think the software needs to be smart enough so the person can figure out how to use certain features. It's like when there's an app update and your operating system tells you about it so you don't have to "sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade" manually 5 times a day.

Immutable blockchain means that the chain's history can't be altered for any reasons other than fixing bugs.
A couple of years ago, there was this largest exchange market - mt.gox and the owner stole tons of bitcoins from his customers. If we, as the network, decided to "take away" stolen coins and give it back to the rightful owners, that would mean the blockchain isn't immutable.
I don't think any coin is suited for retail long-term unless its blockchain is extended with a bit less decentralized second layer. Dash's instant payment is probably the most suited for it as of now. However, almost nobody uses Dash for anything other than speculation.

The password isn't stored anywhere. 
When you open your wallet file in a text editor and find "keystore" object (the content of the file is just a json object) you'll see that "seed" and "xpriv" (master private key) are encrypted. 
When you type in your password it simply decrypts those values using a certain known algorithm and checks whether those decrypted data make any sense (let's say checks the seed against the master private key). I don't know details of Electrum so it may be done differently but the password definitely isn't stored anywhere.

Bitcoin fails when only people that can afford to run full nodes are miners. They could effectively change the protocol in any way they like.

It's not about pride. They understand crypto and decentralization better than any of us talking shit all day long and they stick to the knowledge they possess. They clearly know what needs to be done before Bitcoin is able to handle mainstream adoption and any compromise with plebs like us would endanger this vision. 
Do you also think your voice matters when it comes to a brain surgery? So why do you think your voice matters when it comes to a highly technical field which Bitcoin is?

@_date: 2017-03-28 15:19:31
Btw what's the difference between 2-3MB increase with SegWit and 2-x MB HF? Apart from the fact that with a HF you're forcing people out of the network? You still need to store more data with both solutions so even SegWit with a block increase harms decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:06:59


I know what it allows in the future, I was just talking purely about SegWit block size increase vs other solutions.
Btw IIRC, 2MB classic fixes malleability via flextrans?

Not for those that are in control of their private keys. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 07:44:13
You can never lose your coins nor you can be prevented accessing them as long as you (and you only) hold the seed that is generated for you the first time you use TREZOR. 
A seed is a combination of random words that is used to derive private keys from.
If the scenario you're talking about would take place, you would download Electrum (or any other compatible wallet) and simply restore your wallet with the seed.

How should I explain to my clients that they won't receive their bitcoins in next 30 (sometimes 60) minutes when being almost "instant" (which was the case a year ago) is supposedly one of the major features of Bitcoin? 
Ofc it's fair to say it doesn't happen all the time yet it's very frustrating when it does. I hope 2MB limit or SegWit or whatever solution is implemented soon.

Miners aren't the market. Miners are.... miners. They organize transactions into blocks and add security to it.
The market is your company, users, wallet providers, exchanges and everyone else using and/or building on top the network - entities that with their money decide what Bitcoin looks like. If big mining pools disappear tomorrow, we'll lose the security temporarily, but individual miners will take their place and we move on. Bitcoin won't cease to exist. On the other hand, guess what happens when market participants disappear?

I don't share your collectivist views on Bitcoin. I don't think there's any "we" and "us" and I definitely don't believe Bitcoin should go to the moon and see mainstream adoption anytime soon. 
There are many bugs and shortcomings that need to be addressed first so it makes a lot of sense to reject new (consensus-breaking) ideas and keep Bitcoin limited for now while the focus is on solving existing issues rather than creating new ones. Decentralization is key to the system's health and if someone is endangering this very property by spreading FUD and propaganda either intentionally or accidentally I will keep down-voting, echo-chambering, ridiculing, pointing out to stupid and doing anything I can to stop it.
Maybe all you care about is price, perhaps you want to become rich quick like others did in the past, but for me, Bitcoin is bigger than that. It represents freedom and allows for more pro-liberty use cases being built on top of that. First time in the history, I'm confident that there's a tool or a framework if you will, that can make governments irrelevant and help build a different - better world. And I won't let anyone ruin it for me (and possibly others that share the same view).
P.S. I'm glad core devs stick to their vision of a truly decentralized cryptocurrency and don't make any compromises with malicious parties.

They can't do shit. They can't even stop all the "illegal" markets within their own centralized economy.
If necessary, people will learn how to use other decentralized techs so they aren't reliant on government economy. 
The Internet over wifi mesh networks, bitcoins/shitcoins traded via Bitsquare, goods/services traded via OpenBazaar 2.0 (with IPFS, Tor and ShapeShift /Monero/ support), decentralized shipping services with an onion-style drone routing. That's just one of many possible ways how people can get around government laws and regulations.

I never said it solves any problem. It solves consequences when problems arise.

By that time we will very likely have LN and other second layer payment channels. Bitcoin's block space is a scarce resource and it has to be treated as such. Sure, raising the limit may be needed in the future to some extent but it cannot grow infinitely (unless users are willing to compensate full nodes). Someone gotta pay for it. There's no such thing as free lunch.

They can do 51% attack, or just mine empty blocks so you can't transact anything etc. Sure they can do it without BU too but it would be difficult without divided community. Once economic parties (wallets, exchanges etc) accept BU at large, it will be easier for them (Chinese pools) to carry such attacks because getting back together to defend against them will take some time, if ever possible.
Giving (any) miners enough incentives to attack the network is never good idea.

Please read my post again, I spoke for myself only. I don't have a Bitcoin vision for you or anyone else. Decentralization is freedom for me personally and I don't care if you don't get same benefits as I do. This is not some kind of democratic system where "we" collectively get to decide how things should be. I decide for myself, you decide for yourself and if our opinions intersect then we end up on the same network. If we don't, then I will do everything that is in my power to keep you from messing up with "my" network. Yes, I can definitely use market tools (down-voting, ostracizing etc) to achieve what I think is good for the system I'm invested in. You're free to do the same. That's what decentralization with fully autonomous actors free to behave in any way they deem appropriate is all about. No contradictions in my post whatsoever.

Not really. Imagine there's enough mining support for 2mb limit and also lot of support on the nodes side. Miners fork the network, bigblockers get what they wanted and turn off most of their temporary nodes. 
Suddenly we have the forked network and only few nodes that understand 2mb block size limit. Miners create their big blocks but the majority of network will ignore them resulting in everyone losing in the end. How is this a good thing?

No it's impossible as the seed nor your private keys never leave your TREZOR. 
Only if you try to recover the wallet your seed may get caught by a keylogger (if your computer is infected). Since the recovery process asks you to fill in the seed words in random order the chances of an attacker getting the right order however are [next to impossible](
FYI the code for mytrezor.com is [public]( and it doesn't seem to do anything harmful. 
Don't worry you're perfectly safe unless you don't fall for some kind of [phishing attack]( when an attacker would be able to get the correct seed directly from you.

It's absolutely necessary for masses all over the world (even in poor countries) to run their own nodes.

They don't. SegWit allows for more data size and speed optimizations (MAST, Schnorr signatures and possibly other exciting features /deployable as soft forks/) which is the real scaling solution. Linearly adding more space is costly (more so in distributed systems) and just puts more and more pressure on full nodes which are the backbone of the whole ecosystem.

What Satoshi "forgot" to mention at the time is that Bitcoin is the longest **valid** chain. You can create blocks all you want (nothing is stopping you) but if they don't follow consensus rules they will ultimately be rejected by full nodes as invalid. BU blocks **will be invalid** once they are larger than 1000KB, therefore BU cannot be Bitcoin regardless of the PoW done.

Though I'm all for status quo (rather than BU or any other hostile takeover), I don't entirely agree with you. The reason legitimate uses amount to ~750k/block might be exactly because of the small block size limit. Businesses are put off to use Bitcoin because their use cases require far more processed txs per second and we won't be getting it anytime soon.  
Now, I'm not saying the limit needs to be raised but I think "we" definitely need Schnorr signatures and other optimizations so "we" can fit more txs into a single block. This would help alleviate fee pressure a bit while not raising the cost of running a full node. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:42:56
It is centralized and it's not at the same time. When it comes to playing it safe it might be more centralized (the case you linked to) which isn't that bad after all. When it comes to harming the network mining is reasonably decentralized. If it wasn't the case we would already see the whole project fail under some type of 51% attack or else. It's the huge money invested that prefer common sense over ill intentions so I wouldn't call the current situation **dangerous**. Actually it's really good that everybody is in it for profit which makes the whole network quite safe, because nobody involved wants it to fail (perhaps except governments).

Soft fork - backward compatible. Miners activate it, users may or may not follow. If they don't they still get to use Bitcoin without the new feature.
Hard fork - an absolute majority of the economy (full nodes run by exchanges, businesses, users, miners etc) activate it. Miners have to follow in order to create valid blocks. 
BU - miners want to change protocol rules without much economic support which will result in invalid blocks rejected by full nodes.
To answer your question, the economic majority has the final word in this particular case. However, miners can split the network regardless.

I think there's a huge difference between an accidental hard fork and a purposeful one that the whole ecosystem can prepare for.


The price took a huge dive in around middle of April 2013 and I think it was due to an exponential price rise rather than the hard fork which took place almost 3 weeks earlier. I remember this very clearly because March 2013 is when I bought my first coins.


Just to clarify, ~70% of what I own is on TREZOR. All my income streams (except google adsense and occasional coding) is bitcoin related. Your assumptions are wrong. Yet I'm not afraid of a temporary price dive (if it was ever to happen). What I'm worried about is the long term health of the network. 
As I said earlier we will probably HAVE to do some hard forks in the future. And I think it's much safer to figure out the whole process when the market is "just" $6bn rather than $600bn.

If less decentralization is not a concern then they failed to explain why they think 2mb block size limit would break stuff.
If it's just a fear of hard fork itself I think they should man up because they will have to do it at some point later anyway. The sooner they learn how to fork the safest way possible, the better.

HD (hierarchically determined) in Multibit HD means that there is an extended public key (and its private counterpart) which is used to derivate (not sure if that's the right word, English is not my first language) wallet addresses.
Since it's very bad for your privacy to reuse the same address, an HD wallet gives you a new address for each transaction. That's the correct behavior. 
And because a master public key is all you need to generate keys, a master private key is all you need to backup to get access to all your unspent outputs. That was a main motivation to create this system I think.
This whole "HD" thing is explained in [BIP32](


No, wallet is wallet and bitcoin address is your "banknote".

Now I'm shifting my attention towards local businesses. I'm no evangelist like let's say Andreas Antonopoulos but I have had success bringing way more than 100 people to Bitcoin.

No, we don't. First of all, there's no such thing as "we" when it comes to decentralization. There's only bunch of "I's". I don't care if you can't afford to use Bitcoin - I can and that's all that matters for me.
Secondly and most importantly, I'm glad Bitcoin world is finally facing the reality of free lunch myth. You can't have security, decentralization and free/cheap transactions at the same time. That's nonsense spewed by people looking at a decentralized system as if it was a centrally planned government program. 
People need to start employing the new thinking, otherwise, they will have a hard time existing in this emerging decentralized world.

Of course you do, you just don't pay for it directly. You pay for it when taking a loan, or get additional services, or when purchasing from a vendor which has to raise prices of his goods/services to cover the cost of a card tx etc. Nothing in this world is free my friend.


You clearly don't understand how decentralization works. You can't have free txs, speed and security at the same time. Bitcoin is the most secure network in the world thus you have to compromise on the speed and the price.
Why do you think anyone would buy shitloads of expensive HW and pay lots of money for electricity just so you can have free transactions? This is not a charity and at the end of the day, there are real costs that has to be paid.

That's not true. The community raised tons of money for different causes and it was also heavily used for tipping here on reddit (there were also a couple of stores accepting it).

I exchanged too little becasue Bank of Taiwan (as an only option to get Filipino pesos beforehand) is scam and I knew they were going to charge me 30% more (it's not about the price fluctuatoin rather about overly inflated exchange rate). They would also scam me at the Cebu airport or virtually anywhere in the Philippines because that's how South East Asia is to foreigners. They see a white face and think we grow money on trees :)
I don't care about price fluctuation, what was I saying was that Coins.ph only charged me around 2.8% above the current market price which is way cheaper than any other available option.

@_date: 2016-11-16 12:35:33


That's not how it works, though. You simply can't have all 3 and be decentralized at the same time. That's for example why Dash introduced fairly "centralized" master nodes so it can allow more transaction throughput for the same cost. Had they done it the "standard" way, their decentralization would be greater but the cost would be way higher with the same txs/s ratio. They would eventually run into same problems as we have with Bitcoin. That's just how decentralized systems are and always will be (unless the storage and bandwidth cost is XXXXXX times lower)


Which I think is a great message to everyone that prefers security over anything else. Bitcoin is so secure, you virtually can't change the protocol despite all the politics and other bullshit. On the other hand, it only took populism of one "politician" to change the protocol of the "othercoin". I think that's a problem.

I think it was because of Bitfinex. The market doesn't necessarily trust them after all the fuck ups. So when they say they go offline for a maintenance it may mean anything, even that they were hacked again. Add the China ban hoax to it and you have a disaster.

I think almost nobody argues against bigger block size limit because of technical limitations. IIRC there were some tests done in the past and even Chinese would be able to "process" ~3-4MB blocks. It's just, as we learned from Ethereum, contentious hard forks are very dangerous.

It doesn't permit any new use cases, it just lets you control Mycelium's payment API with PHP on your eshop. Currently, they only have Ruby implementation available. 
It allows you to create a unique payment request via Mycelium Gear for each customer order and then automatically process it when payment is made. Wallet addresses are generated from your PC/mobile/HW wallet's master public key which means you have a hassle-free payment system for your eshop and are fully in control of your funds at the same time.

Because you subsidize the price for those that pay by card. I ran an eshop couple of years ago and that's how I had to set the prices.

Sorry I'm sick now I can barely lie in my bed. Anyway all you need to do is add 
to bitcoin.conf (probably located in ~/bitcoin) to tell your node to keep only last ~2000MB of the chain. Change the number accordingly.
Then just start the node with -reindex parameter.
If you need to install the node from scratch, you can try [my tutorial]( which is for RPi3, but since Cent OS is debian-based it could work (you may want to skip the berkley db part).
Or you can wait a couple of weeks until I get better and I can set it up for you. However you shouldn't trust anyone (!!!) especially if you want to run the node as a wallet.

Bitcoin currently works for micropayments but I don't necessarily think it should work for them in the future. I think we won't see mass adoption of coffee drinkers, but we'll definitely see mass adoption of companies and poor people from remittance markets that need to make 1 transaction a week/month based on their pay. Everything else can be done off-chain with just a very little compromise in the security. 
And yes, Bitcoin can never handle Visa volume on-chain even with the unlimited block size without introducing some kind of "centralized" master nodes like ones in Dash. Decentralization is very inefficient and expensive so you either pay big time, or you bring down the cost by introducing little less decentralized solutions. AFAIK there's no other way around it.

In the case of a hard fork, updates need to be run by (almost) everyone because peers that don't run it will be forced out of the network.
In the case of a soft fork, it needs to be run by the majority of miners. It should also be run by the majority of users to get the full security but changes are backward compatible so it's not required. 
When it comes to non-consensus changes you can "safely" ignore them, however, you should not because they often contain bug fixes and other improvements.

Satoshi invented the thing and capped it to 32MB initially just to change it to 1MB later. It's not like there were no limits at all. The block space IS a scarce resource and has to be treated as such. 
All the "big block" talk about the need for the free market is useless because the market has decided it wants to go from 32MB to 1MB and wants to stay there. We would already have had bigger blocks otherwise.
SegWit was only implemented so big blockers stop whining and now they block it. It doesn't make sense at all.

I think there's no way fees will support the PoW in the future. Pools will need to come up with some other biz models (exchange markets /I think BTCC already does that/, consulting, selling the excessive heat to energy companies, HW production etc) that will subsidy the PoW.
Similarly when shopping malls build roads and sidewalks which are subsidized by rent profits, ads etc. This kind of strategy isn't anything new and miners will have to adapt if they want to stay in business.

Yup, and if you really need to have it confirmed ASAP, you'd just outbid everyone else. It wasn't THAT expensive and it's not like it happens 10x a month anyway.

@_date: 2016-11-16 11:32:57
Supply/demand limits the price of cars, computers, houses and even Bitcoin. The more expensive it gets, the less it's being used and the other way around. The less it's being used the cheaper it gets. It's self-regulating.
We should stop thinking about Bitcoin as an infinite resource. It isn't. There's a real cost behind the network and it can only grow so much.

This narrative that running a full node is just about the bandwidth is plain wrong. You need both CPU power for verifying blocks and RAM to store the growing mempool and the UTXO set.

Depending on what your mission is. I don't see any problem with Bitcoin myself (apart from a couple of bad design decisions). I use it almost daily with no issues, it's cheap, it's fast, it's secure, it's everything I want from a cryptocurrency. I don't really care what others think about Bitcoin because it simply doesn't impact me in any way - it's called a **decentralized** cryptocurrency for a reason.


LN or any other off-chain solution might give those that can't afford using the blockchain what they need. If not, then we won't ever go mainstream. It's fine with me either way.
@_date: 2016-11-04 18:08:47
You'd still validate all blocks, you just have an option to see and spend outputs before the whole chain is synced.
It's good mainly for new users that haven't finished syncing yet but already try to receive bitcoins but "can't see them yet". Now they could.
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:41:46


I don't think so. Core devs understand Bitcoin like no one else. Unlike Ver that urgently needs on-chain scaling for his shitty casino or others that want to get-rich-quick tomorrow, core devs have a clear vision and know what they're doing. 
I don't agree we should compromise security for anything else, especially for short-term profits and mainstream adoption that could possibly lead to money loss due to a crappy software. 
If it takes a divided community and never ending gridlocks for the sake of the network's security, then be it.

You have it all wrong. Consensus is not decided by miners otherwise NYA/big block miners would have jumped at Bcash chain and call it Bitcoin already.

I remember my first pump &amp; dump in April 2013. 
I bought with little over $1200 (2-3 month salaries for most people in my country - Slovakia) on Bitstamp for $139/BTC. It went to $266 in just 5 days AND then started crashing. I was in disbelieve because I couldn't imagine this thing could crash because it kept rising since January when we talked about it with coworkers.
You couldn't do shit at the time of the crash because the whole platform was lagged. Looking at my trade history on Bitstamp I see that I sold at $233 (not bad right?). It started rising from there suddenly (a dead cat bounce which I haven't heard of back then) so being a rookie I bought back at $238 (the top of the cat) and shat my pants as it kept crashing again. I somehow managed to escape at $159 after almost 2 hours of frantically hitting that refresh button (I wasn't the only one I suppose). Worst 2 hours of my life.
I was so exhausted, with a very little money left so I just cried like a little bitch (I was 24).
Fast forward, I couldn't care less about the price now. Since my first fuckup, I bought for $900, $175 and anywhere in between. I learned way more about trading and most importantly Bitcoin and the price simply doesn't bother me anymore.

If the block size gets "too big", home-run full nodes can no longer bear the cost of the increased storage, bandwidth, CPU usage (for block validation) etc.
There's a risk of them dropping out which leaves us with a network where miners also control the majority of full nodes. Whoever controls both PoW and nodes decides the protocol.

I believe there will be some pools that will find ways to subsidize mining by offering other services like an exchange market, bitcoin consulting, selling mining HW, bitcoin debit cards etc. Though mining will be at a net loss they will still need to secure the network for their other businesses which will be profitable.
It's similar to a shopping mall building an infrastructure around their property. It doesn't make any direct profit, it's used freely even by non-customers but is subsidized by other services (rent, advertisement etc) which are profitable.

Ok, the point is that bitcoin was WAY cheaper than it's now so of course USD fees are higher. The satoshi fee value hasn't changed.
I made a ~0.005 BTC transaction for a fee of 0.0001 BTC (7 cents) a little over an hour ago and it already has 6 confirmations. In terms of satoshis it costs me essentially the same as years ago and I got into block almost immediately. I really don't know what are people complaining about? Sometimes it's cheap, sometimes little more expensive but Bitcoin works as intended (even for micropayments).

Block size is not an issue. It's a contentious hard fork that everyone should oppose. Haven't we learned a lesson from the ETH/ETC fail?


The fundamental problem is that there are tons of non-tech people having the loudest voice about tech issues. Amateur opinions aren't taken seriously in let's say the medical field. Why should they be taken seriously in the crypto world which requires a high level of knowledge then?
Bitcoin's security lies within mathematics and strong cryptography, not populism. Whoever is interested in politics should get Ethereum instead or just fork off the network once and for all.

The thing is Chinese pools don't necessarily comprise of Chinese-only miners. The rest of miners would simply point their computing power to other pools (which could temporarily incentivize them with lower fees) and China would very likely no longer have the majority of hash rate.

More hash power means more security for everyone's money which is the most important property of Bitcoin. More security attracts more users, which drives the price up. Sure miners are getting richer.. so does everyone else.


It was Satoshi who introduced 32MB to the protocol just to lower the limit to 1MB via soft fork later. If you haven't noticed yet, core devs are working around these limitations (imposed on them) with SegWit which will later lead to even more tx throughput via LN.

Just run your own full node and see for yourself how long it takes to validate every single block (CPU resources), how big your mempool is (RAM), how much data is transfered (bandwidth) and stored (HDD/SDD). Then multiply it by whatever number you want the new block size limit to be. That's a rough estimate of **maximum** resources needed to allow for more onchain tx throughput.
Somehow implying we won't be sacrifying anything is a false statement. More resources needed =&gt; higher cost =&gt; less nodes =&gt; more centralization. That's basic economics, not an opinion.
The sacrifice for cheap transaction is pretty big. It's just invisible to an average Joe that doesn't bear the cost.
@_date: 2016-12-26 14:19:21


You can safely ignore it. It offers to import a private key from another wallet (let's say your PC). It would then allow you to spend that output on your mobile.

These electronics are designed to handle tens of thousands of power cycles. If you barely use it the chances of failure are slim. Plus it’s common to store the mnemonic seed in Cryptosteel in the case there’s something wrong with your HW wallet. Paper is just paper and will always be weaker than most other materials. Also, paper wallets usually store just a single key which is not very user-friendly nor private (address reuse) especially if you want to add more coins in the future.
There isn’t much that paper wallet does better than the HW wallet except for its price.

In what way is he corrupt? To me it sounds like a butt hurt from people that thought they knew how to do margin trading. Don't go on the market if you can't afford to lose everything.
I don't know why kids think a margin trading (especially on highly non-liquid, very high spread, high volatile market and with very little capital on a trader's side) is the way to make money? It's highly risky and if you have no idea what you are doing you're always going to lose money. 
Sure if the system wasn't buggy and you would have enough liquidity to stay far away from a margin call you could still have your positions opened, but this 10000btc dump would make the market crash regardless of it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:31:09
Here’s your proof 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:15:00
You couldn't buy back because of the spread and ongoing short/long war. The price was flying from 190 to 250 and back and forth in matter of seconds. Their margin call system failed hard that's for sure. But I doubt there's anything to sue them for. Margin trading, especially with a leverage is very risky. More so on the high volatile, high spread, low liquid market as Bitcoin is.

Security is the main advantage. Hacking your home PC likely hidden behind a firewall is more difficult than Amazon employee accessing your instance. 
Slow connection isn’t a big deal for non-mining nodes, sync time likely isn’t slower as it depends more on the CPU than on the bandwidth (it takes more time to verify a block than downloading it). 
Also I’m not sure how much cheaper is their storage and for how long. I bought a home server (Intel NUC with 16GB ram and 1TB storage) for around €500. I guess that’s what you’d pay for AWS in 1-2 years, unless you prune your node.

You have to be very naive to think they mine on BU. Their hashrate would have dropped significantly everytime BU nodes massively crashed.

Yes they have their "etherchain".
When it comes to "classic" I have no problem with it replacing the current implementation on the same chain as long as:
1) that's what the majority of the ecosystem wants (people will put the money where their mouth is)
2) there are are some prominent developers behind it (Gavin just wants to start and then [go back to research]( and Jeff can't do the whole work all by himself) 
We may argue whether the majority wants the fork. I think at least miners and some businesses (web wallets, exchanges etc) do and full nodes would probably follow them. But I don't think Toomim is capable of maintaining the new fork while [he's not even able to merge the code]( from the core. If core devs wouldn't choose to cooperate with "classic" that would be disaster resulting in everyone losing.

We may not solve it with Roger because he clearly has different ideas about what is Bitcoin, but we will eventually solve it without him for sure.

If this initiative doesn't gain any traction it's ok, I will still keep ignoring him for the sake of my own mental well-being.

With these tactics and such centralized mindset he can only bring down the price (for some time), not the network/protocol itself. It will take some time until people realize that this decentralized world is a completely new phenomena that requires totally different way of thinking. Bitcoin doesn't give two fucks about any single person (take Satoshi as an example) and therefore is resistant to all BS human race has to offer. If this wasn't true governments all over the world would have destroyed it by now. They just can't. It would take ~100% of participants (and participants only) to bring down the network completely (and I'm not talking about 51% attack etc). Which is not an easy task, because sometimes even 20 developers can't agree on basic issues, let alone millions of users. 
I'll say it again - Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck.
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:10:10
I think you're overthinking it too much. I'd print the private key on the note and have it sealed. If the seal is broken, the note is useless and shouldn't be accepted by anyone. If you want to cash out, just break the seal and swipe the key. Ofc the seal can't be fixed once broken.
Let users handle the privacy/security part as they are used to do with cash. This way you only have to trust the note issuer but can completely ignore the exchange that is suppose to help you cash out. As a business you can always quicky scan the qr to chceck the balance before accepting it.

Blocks are only full during "spam attacks" such as when an owner of [this output]( goes mental. People like him also artificially drive up an average price of a fee.
Sure it's more expensive to use the network than say 2 years ago, but whoever is surprised about it doesn't understand decentralization. As the user base grows, you can't have cheap and fast transactions while preserving the same level of security and decentralization at the same time. You have to make tradeoffs. Either we worsen decentralization by putting more pressure on validating node operators with much larger blocks, or the price goes higher because the block space is more scarce (and it should be scarce because there is real cost behind it). Altcoins will have to deal with same problems if/when they get as big as Bitcoin. Some of them (Dash) already made tradeoffs in forms of introducing a bit more centralization via master nodes so they can have cheap instant transactions. Bitcoin will go a similar route with second layers such as LN.


It's not sudden. Everyone knew it was gonna happen, but no one knew it was gonna happen so early. IIRC even Satoshi briefly talked about second layers.

Seems like Gavin wasn't/isn't running a node on his own hardware putting his OWN money on the table. An immediate bump to 20mb would cost a lot for those that operate nodes on their own VPS/dedicated servers. However you can always switch to bitseed which is ~$200 and comes with a 1TB drive.

We probably have different ideas on what "scaling" is. I don't consider a linear increase of resources to achieve a linear increase of tx throughput to be scaling. Even university "programmers" can do better.


I'm ok with them doing it but not at the expense of validating nodes run by individuals being forced out of the network. Validating nodes keep miners in check, exactly how Satoshi designed it (you like to bring Satoshi a lot so I thought I'd do the same):


If the network loses this safety mechanism I consider it to be a failed experiment because there's nothing protecting the network against mining cartels.


AFAIK only a single person wants to edit the paper. It's pretty common with Core opponents to attribute words of individuals to the whole "group". It's very dishonest.


I don't think the market for raising the blocksize limit is particularly big. There have been 3 takeover attempts already and so far they all failed (BU failing now). Had the demand for big blocks been bigger we'd already have them by now.

Demand will be dropping if fees are too high and raising if fees are too low. Miners will never be able to form a monopoly (unlike banks that get their privilege from governments), because the market can always either change the PoW or switch to a different cryptocurrency. That's why the most parties involved will act reasonably while trying to maximize profit and minimize the cost. 
In the future I can even see a business model where mining operators might own exchanges at the same time. That way tx price could be totally free (or very cheap) and it would be paid for by trading fees on the exchange market. 
It's the same as let's say private parks in Hong Kong. The entrance is free, toilet as well but there is either restaurant on the property or some other type of business that subsidies those "free" services. 
We're still at an early stage of crypto world and things are yet to be discovered.

Here's the data I extracted from coin.dance.
No. of participants: **188**  
No. of miners (including bitmain, which in fact is antpool): **21**  
No. of miners either in favor of SW or SW-ready: **8**  
No. of participants excluding non-SW miners (188 - (21 - 8)): **175**  
SW supporters or SW-ready incl. SW miners: **136** (**77.7%** out of 175)  
No. of participants excl. all miners (188 - 21): **167**  
SW supporters or SW-ready excl. SW miners (136 - 8): **128** (**76.64%** out of 167)  
Given that only 4% of all participants are explicitly against SW, and more than 85% of full nodes are signaling for SW the market support for SegWit is pretty obvious. 
Perhaps, I could have phrased it other than "**almost** unanimous support", but the numbers are big nevertheless.

They can hard fork BUT they need full nodes to follow them. Without full nodes their chain is useless and they just burn electricity money. I'm really wondering where is that stupid idea of miners controlling the network coming from...

On-chain scaling (I mean real scaling, not just 20txps via 4MB blocks) is not possible if you eventually don't want to end up with the network where only big mining pools can afford to run validating nodes. That would be a disaster for decentralization as miners could force any change on users.
I think second layers seem inevitable. They scale much better (with some tradeoffs of course).


From what I understand they are mostly resistant to contentious hard forks rather than block size increase.
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:08:13

That's a lie (or perhaps you just don't remember?). Miners (at least Wang Chun) broke the agreement by switching to Bitcoin "classic" a few weeks after HK. 


That was only true when mining nodes and validating nodes were the same things. Also, there were no centralized pools at the time so "1 CPU = 1 vote" was still applicable. It's not anymore.
If you read through the consensus code it's pretty obvious it's validating nodes only who create and maintain consensus. Miners "only" reorder transactions and secure them with PoW. Lot of them don't even validate received blocks, so clearly they aren't part of the consensus.

They aren't users in the technical sense (mining nodes are different from validating nodes). They often don't even validate incoming blocks to get an advantage in mining.
They are hardly users even in a social/economic sense too. They only care about profit, that's how mining was designed. Users on the other hand care about long-term health of the network, decentralization, trustless-ness etc, because those are benefits they get rather than being directly financially compensated.
Miners and users are two distinct groups with different motives.

I don't think the fee market will ever emerge. You can only raise fees so much before everybody starts using a cheaper currency and current miners are left with nothing else but expensive calculators.
I think a lot of big pools will subsidy mining with profits from other bitcoin-related services such as their own exchanges etc. It's the similar idea like a shopping mall building an infrastructure at their property and subsiding it with profits from the rent and other services. If they directly charged their customers for using the road, they would probably have none.

Longest chain isn't considered Bitcoin if it's invalid. The validity isn't decided only by miners but by every single full node with some economic activity on it. Miners can change rules all they want, my wallet will reject their blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:14:07


Only hard forks that I'm willing to run on my node are those that fix shit. Increased capacity subsidized by nodes isn't the one. 
I'm almost certain that scaling on-chain isn't possible if we want to keep the network fairly decentralized. I'm already running a small dedicated Bitcoin server on a $600 HW (not that much, but it's a median salary in lots of developed countries) + the monthly bandwidth + electricity + future HW upgrades. I'm wondering how much longer will I be able to subsidize it so that wealthy corporations can keep making money with their shit business models based on assumptions that Bitcoin should handle tons of free/cheap "spam" that they keep creating.
I know people like and others probably think they're entitled to our resources but until nodes are financially compensated to an extent I'm not willing to process terabytes of data for them while they're the one profiting of off it. Sure I make money with the growing price of BTC but I think my point still stands.

The value is always given by the market at the particular time because "value" is subjective for each market participant. A predictable cash flow doesn't tell you much about the future of the business the same way past performance is not indicative of future results. You can never be sure about the future thus you can't say Apple has value because they sold 10M iPhones last year even though their stock crashed 50% since (made up numbers).


I don't agree. Price is just a formal representation of value.

Stop lying. 94% of miners are signaling for the intent to run 2x in the future. Only very few nodes run btc1 software which seems like no one really wants segwit2x apart from 50 or so **individual** CEOs. 
Also, miners don't decide shit the same way Foxconn doesn't decide what kind of chips they'll make for Apple.

I think they won it because their electricity is heavily subsidized by the government for one reason or another. I won't speculate on that.


Bitcoin Core devs are decentralized. Anyone is welcome to add the code to the repo. If you don't try to change consensus rules without having any consensus your changes will likely be accepted (my changes were).

@_date: 2016-10-20 14:11:04
The satoshi or $USD value you intend to send is not at all important when it comes to transaction fees. The fee is calculated based on a transaction size in kb. The more input/outputs it contains the bigger and more expensive it gets.
A transaction of 0.2BTC made of 10 inputs will be more expensive than a transaction of 10BTC made of just a single input.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:12:39

@_date: 2016-10-20 14:40:19
An input is an unspent output of a previous transaction. I'm very bad at explaining technical stuff so let's try to do it this way:
Bitcoin works similar to cash. 
Imagine you have $100 (unspent output of a previous transaction - e.g. your wage) and you only want to buy $15 worth of groceries. You don't tear the bill apart and give the vendor 15% of the bill, but instead, you give him $100 (1 input and 1 output) and he gives you back $85 in $50 (1st unspent output), $20 (2nd out), $10 (3rd out) and $5 bill (4th out). 
You then want to buy a dinner worth of $25 so you will use the $20 and $5 that you received earlier. 
In bitcoin terminology, $20 and $5 would be 2 unspent outputs from the first grocery shopping. The moment you hand it to the restaurant staff you've created a transaction with 2 inputs ($20 and $5) and 1 output ($25).
I hope it's clear?
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:49:15
That likely won't work. I also had to restore the wallet from a seed.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:20:06
You can try to double-spend your transactions or wait until the mempool gets smaller and your tx ends up in a block. If you wait long enough your tx may also be removed from mempool and you can send it again with a higher fee.
@_date: 2016-10-26 14:32:10

Not a big deal. I'm running my node behind a dynamic IP address (pointed to a hostname). What matters the most is the pubkey.


Yes, just transfer the whole ~/.lnd directory (you may want to stop the node first /but keep the files just in case something goes wrong/ to make sure you're transferring the current state) to the new machine and then restore your wallet from the seed with `lncli create` (follow the onscreen instructions).
@_date: 2016-10-29 12:04:26
It doesn't matter how big the block size limit is. Spammers don't spam the whole block space, they only spam the remaining space while the rest is used by "genuine" transactions. If bitcoin gets popular blocks will be ~90% full in either case so the cost of spamming the rest won't be that expensive.
We need better solutions which don't require raising limits every time there's a problem. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:45:30
Depending on your setup, you may want to leave the fee calculation to your wallet.

Though I don't like most of the shitcoins because they are just quick pumps &amp; dumps, I agree that there won't be a single do-it-all coin even in distant future.
On the other hand the crypto share itself doesn't mean anything apart from the fact that new money goes to shitcoins faster than to Bitcoin (which makes sense, because let's say 100LTC sounds better than 1BTC for the same price). Bitcoin's market cap still grows so I wouldn't be worried.

Basically, 2MB HF + SegWit lets use both legacy and upgraded users 2MB block space (with SegWit it might be a bit more depending on the tx type). 
With only SegWit, legacy users are limited by the current 1MB block size limit while SegWit users can enjoy the discount.

When it comes to someone "taking in the benefits".. You can't blame a victim that is forced to use heavily monopolized government services like roads etc. There isn't any alternative because of the government gun so one is forced to use whatever service is available.

That's not true. Bitcoin's strength is security which makes it more difficult for innovation to get any consensus.
Let's say Ethereum on the other hand doesn't care about security and they can afford to innovate much faster.

These generous miners also block segwit for political reasons. With segwit + LN we could have thousands of cheap transactions per second.

In addition to being poor (at the time) I was also dumb as shit. I think I was even mining Bitcoin in 2010 for some time because I was into BOINC and this type of shit. Yet, I didn't think Bitcoin was good enough. That was a very costly mistake.
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:31:25


I did a little math for you regardless of the block time.
100 LTC blocks from 1199506 - 1199605 had **2013 transactions**.
The equivalent of 20 BTC blocks from 465251 - 465270 had **30620 transactions**.
Bitcoin was used more than 1421% more within the past ~3 hours. 
It's pretty obvious Litecoin is barely used comparing to Bitcoin which very often fits 100 blocks worth of Litecoin transactions into a single block or 10 minutes of transactions.


Litecoin transaction data simply can't be used for Bitcoin mainnet. It's like trying to use speed data from Toyota Corolla for Ferrari. It doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:13:14
Except they aren't activating SegWit but something else, since their proposal isn't compatible with BIP 141. Basically every +0.13.1 node would have to update to use their version of "SegWit" which isn't happening in 4 months.

Maybe that's good for their own sake. I could never recommend a centralized online wallet to anyone. Those systems fail too often to be considered a viable alternative to holding coins yourself.
People should learn to use Bitcoin the way it's supposed to be used or they should refrain from using it altogether.

However, it isn't valid if users don't follow them. Miners usually "decide" consensus after there's already support from users/exchanges/vendors/devs/etc, never the other way around (they can't risk splitting the coin by implementing features that users don't want and losing the mining reward)


Have you heard of SPV mining? Some miners can't really reject anything as they don't validate anything in the first place. The question is whether that is the majority (I don't know). 


No, it doesn't work like that, see my first point. Without the economic participants (that give bitcoin value by exchanging it for goods/services/currencies) following miners, it doesn't really matter what miners see as valid. It's invalid for everyone else. Had it been the other way around we'd already have had XT/"classic"/BU/&lt;insert new scam's name&gt; by now.

As soon as you try dumping say 1M BTC the price will crash before you even get to sell anything. Whales will have to dump in smaller chunks which usually don't affect the price that much.
It's a non-issue unless whales are governments with an intention to hurt Bitcoin hodlers. In that case, I'll be gladly buying their cheap coins. And I won't be alone.

Yes, I will still use Bitcoin regardless of the government's wishes. 
However, Bitcoin is NOT anonymous.

SPV security means you're trusting miners. Miners are not to be trusted especially when we know they've been selfish-mining, mining on top of unverified blocks etc. 
Also, most "SPV" wallets such as Electrum don't even follow SPV specification. 
Without proper SPV implementation with fraud proofs, running a full node is an absolute necessity.

I tested this library half a year ago and sometimes (no idea when and why) it returns wrong addresses. 
You can test it yourself by pasting this into Electrum console (it will tell Electrum to always give you 50 addresses): wallet.storage.put('gap_limit', 50)
and then derivate 50 addresses from Electrum XPUB using the PHP library. The chances are at least 2 or 3 addresses will be wrong.

@_date: 2017-05-22 18:31:27


No, that's not how it works.
When it comes to hard forks, consensus has to be found (ideally) by every single peer on the network. Everyone that disagree is forked off the network.


There's nothing like "consensus voting governance" in Bitcoin. There's only what you could call a "miners' signaling" which by itself doesn't change the protocol.


This is even worse with 5 or so Chinese mining pools. Unlike this very small mining cartel, Bitcoin development comprises of ~100 individuals working either for themselves or for many different companies and organizations.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:43:56
Comparing to a full node, yes. Nothing is more secure than that. 
However, SegWit is backward compatible with more security and better UX for old nodes when compared to extblks.
Choosing the worse out of two solutions makes no sense whatsoever.

Why would you believe what miners that've been involved in politics for past years say? We will know whether they're telling us truth once SegWit activates.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:09:52


No it can't. Perhaps you can elaborate?


They would, but at least, as an old node with SegWit you have a pseudo-SPV level of security. With extblks you have no clue about anything that happened inside the extblks. 


That only applies to extblks nodes. Old nodes can spend those outputs immediately and then wonder why they have to wait 100 blocks for confirmation.
That's a very bad UX on par with a clogged network and high fees. Even worse because you can still transact on the clogged network if you're willing to bear the cost.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:48:51


I'm not saying that. I'm saying, there isn't any reason for the price to almost double just because of the predictable supply shortage. 
The halvening is a very well known event and because the price has almost doubled in the past 6 months, it may be an indicator that this known event is already reflected in the current price. 
If you look at the last halvening of LTC, nothing really happened **at the time of the event**, but way before.

No, they will do the exact opposite. They will make entry to the market more expensive for everyone else =&gt; less competition =&gt; less innovations etc.
Just look what has the patent war done to the phone industry. Phones haven't changed much since first iPhone. Sure, they grew bigger and are as fast as most of computers, but I haven't seen that much in terms of **innovations** - just because companies have to spend hundreds of millions on lawyers and settlements.

I don't agree with him on most points and I got very pissed off that shapeshift signed the NY agreement to the point I stopped using shapeshift, but calling him Roger Ver Lite is too much.
Ver is clearly a malicious shitcoins pumper that'd even sell his mom for a good chunk of dash or any other scam. I don't get the same impression about Erik. Not even close. 
He just wants to scale Bitcoin because he chose the wrong business model based on the free/cheap block space at that time. Now when the cost is higher he wants to externalize his wrong decision on node operators. He's just a businessman wanting to scale his biz and he wants everyone else to bear the cost. He's selfish but hardly malicious.

Such transactions are ignored by nodes by default (unless explicitly allowed).

You didn't ask me too, but I'll reply.
I spend extra electricity for running my dedicated bitcoin laptop 24/7. I don't measure how much that is but it's surely more than I get back for doing so (which is $0). It will also obviously break down at some point and since I run it on a macbook it won't be cheap to fix/replace.
I also run (well my laptop has some problems now but will be back up soon) an Electrum server for anyone to use for free. I've had hundreds of users using it.
I will probably run a LN node too with a couple of bitcoins and maybe even litecoins on it.
Why are you even asking?

The longest **valid** chain. I don't know about other implementations of Bitcoin consensus rules, but my Bitcoin Core node would never follow the longest **invalid** chain. You don't have to believe me, you can prove it yourself by reading the code.


No, that's not true. User-activated soft-forks were used in the past to change consensus rules. Miners don't decide rules (again, read the consensus code) they only decide which transaction makes into a block.

Yes, they are supposed to signal SegWit2x on both bit 1 and bit 4. They are only [signaling]( on bit 4. 
The correct version should look like this:
20000012 (1 = BIP91, 2 = BIP141)
and their version looks like this:
So basically they're just running BIP91 without the current SegWit deployment.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:01:16

Did Garzik change the code last minute?

HF is like democracy which has no place in the crypto world. Consensus means either almost everyone agrees or status quo.
What I mean by that is even 51% majority decides the future for everyone else. If you don't agree with this "majority", you can stop using Bitcoin or you can use Bitcoin which you don't agree with. This is not only immoral but also dangerous as many parties will want to use Bitcoin according to their vision, not yours (see ETH/ETC fork) and they will refuse to fork.
With SF, nobody can force you to update to the latest protocol and you can keep using the Bitcoin the way you like only with some minor security trade-offs. This kind of approach seems less disruptive and more moral.

Mining is a very low margin business because of the high electricity cost. Let's say your cost is $1 000 000, $800 000 is your electricity cost, the rest is HW and employees. Your net profit is let's say 5% =&gt; $50000.
If you use ASICboost which helps you save around 30% of the electricity cost that's +$240 000 (30% of $800k) in profit added to your initial profit of $50000. In other words, you boosted your net profit by 380% for by boosting mining efficiency by 30%.
The numbers are made up but you get an idea.

BIP141 can't be activated as MASF before BIP148 anymore as the signaling and lock-in period both take 2 weeks. 
However, UASF could be prevented by something like BIP91 and then SegWit could be activated as MASF after August 1st.

Extension blocks is a very bad idea because it gives you the false sense of backward compatibility and security.
Full nodes not willing to run extblks have different UTXO set and have no way of validating even seemingly valid blocks. 
When a resolution transaction comes back to the main chain, unupgraded node can't tell what was going on within the extension block and can't be sure the block is valid. 
Also, if outputs from such transaction are spent and the block is then orphaned a new recipient will lose money because the resolution tx will be different even if it's included in the new block that replaced the orphaned one.
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:36:00

I wouldn't see it as dramatic as you do. Ethereum is an overhyped semi-decentralized corporate "currency". You can't really compare it to Bitcoin as they serve a different purpose. Basically, if it wasn't for useless ICOs, Ethereum's price would have been double digits. Even if they get past Bitcoin's market cap it doesn't really mean much as it's all mostly just a scam. When that thing crashes there will be a lot of tears.

Nodes often equal to wallets. How is making transactions NOT an "economic activity"?
Miners don't decide HFs. If they fork off the network, their chain is useless and valued at exactly $0 because there isn't anyone to buy their incompatible tokens. 


That's not how markets work. If you as a business start offering services that nobody cares about you either go bankrupt or are forced go back to what the market wants. In either case, you'd quickly be outcompeted by those that are willing to offer what consumers want.

If you are totally new to Bitcoin it's better to just look at this chart 
It tells you how many transactions are in front of you that paid higher fees than you're willing to pay.
For example, right now there are only ~7000 transactions that paid more than 20 satoshi per byte in fees. That's usually 2-3 blocks worth of transactions. So if you pay less than 20, your transaction should be confirmed after 2-3 blocks (20-30 minutes).
If there's 100 000 transactions that paid more than 20 satoshi, then you have to outbid them otherwise your transaction may not confirm in days.

Of course miners talk to the rest of the network otherwise they couldn't be broadcasting any minted blocks to validating nodes. It doesn't make much difference when you DDoS layers communicating with the outside world sitting in front of the mining software instead of DDoSing the mining SW directly. You will cause some kind of damage by taking down part of their infrastructure.
This happens all the time (I'm pretty sure you've witnessed Jihan or Wang Chun crying on twitter about being DDoSed).

Funny, I have the same feeling from you. You seem to repeat the same nonsense I read on rbtc.


It's necessary if you want to use Bitcoin the way you're supposed to = trustlessly. If you don't want to verify data for yourself you might as well keep using the current banking system. 


What? Transactions are signed by those that create them not by miners or other nodes. Miners simply order them in blocks based on some arbitrary rules and give them a timestamp. 


A minority chain can function just as good, it's just a bit slower until the next retarget. It could also potentially attract new miners if it get's through the retarget as mining will become cheaper. 


Nope, see the above point.
The whole post-fork situation depends on which chain users will choose to transact on. If there's user demand on the slower chain it will attract more miners because mining those tokens will likely become more valuable. 
Miners can't really decide shit. Had that been the case, they would have forked to BU or any other nonsense proposed by big blockers long time ago.
