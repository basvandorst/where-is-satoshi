So a BTC maximalist who spends all his days promoting bitcoin and calling out scams is as toxic as a shitcoin promoter / scammer ? Well ok...
I can understand that someone doesn't like Tone, but I'm unable to see how he is toxic.
Please develop

Nah, just the most vocal ones lying to themselves. I'm so happy today :)

Related question : How can you validate your transactions when you use an hardware wallet ?
I have a full node running, but the wallet is empty and my private keys are stored in my HW.

Yes, but marketcap is a useless metric. It shouldn't be mentionned even when Bitcoin dominance is rising.
New shitcoins will come and they will use the marketcap % narrative to pump themselves.

This is one the saddest post I have ever seen...
Come on BCH fanboy, you know that this is just the hard fork announcement pump... And you still need to brag about it here ?
Give it a month or two and both forks combined will be worth less than the bitcoin cash branch today

I hope there is no need to alter the painting in order to solve the puzzle !

Did you figure something out ?
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:45:56
Yup, no problem. I run mine on my SSD and never had an issue

Institutional money trying to pull a fractionnal reserve scheme with BTC.
Still won't work, and it 'll make Bitcoin stronger

Thanks ! And is it possible to have multiple node pointing to the same copy of the blockchain ?
For example, if I  create a dual boot Windows + Ubuntu, can I use the same folder for both ?

This isn't true... Stop upvoting stupid posts like this...
The tax is still high (30% at 01/01/19) but not 60%

They never point out that most ETF will be cash settled, and not BTC settled. 
That makes a huge difference as one will be taken in account for price discovery, the other won't and will only be use for speculation with derivatives around Bitcoin's price.

Thanks, I think I'll stick to the default configuration. I don't want to mess up too much with my full node.
Next step : Lightning node :)
