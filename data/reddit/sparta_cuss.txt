Please take a look at the following. The so-called NaS argument is not based on mathematical proofs, because they are not possible. 
But let's get back to the main topic. The Multigateway will actually be good for Bitcoin, too, because it creates not just an exchange, but genuine interoperability among a variety of coins. This is very powerful stuff.

That was such an interesting presentation. It revealed a lot more about how the Chinese government works and thinks about control and policy issues, not just about Bitcoin. Thank you, techemist, for posting.

I wonder how long such a hands-off approach will last. Japan and the U.S. have tight political relationships, and I would be surprised if Washington and NYC don't try to pressure Japan into creating KYC/AML and innovation-strangling regulation that is  operative in the U.S.

I thought that both Ethereum and Nxt are developing near-instant asset exchanges that are still decentralized. Anyone confirm?

Nxt has never been successfully attacked. If the PoS consensus incentives were vulnerable to attack, why hasn't Nxt been brought down? There is no shortage of Nxt-hate among the PoW crowd. (And, yes, I know this is not a mathematical proof, but neither is the argument made in the paper that you cite.) On the other hand, bitcoin has several times been vulnerable to a 51% attack, which sent miners scrambling to other pools.

Counterparty offers a lot, but the GUI is still a little confusing. However, xnova and the other developers are on the verge of updating it - just a few days, I think.

This is not just another "alt-coin." It relies on Counterparty to create a proprietary coin that will be saved on the bitcoin blockchain. At least that's what I've been able to gather by reading the Counterparty BTT thread. Can someone provide more detail?

I have also had great experiences with Agora: timely deliveries and competitive prices. 
Amagi Metals has also done an excellent job. 
I don't think I had to wait even as long as two weeks for any gold or silver orders to be filled from either vendor.
Thank you both, Agora and Amagi, for offering BTC as a payment option.

I just posted your original image on Facebook. Let's see how long it takes them to take it down.
