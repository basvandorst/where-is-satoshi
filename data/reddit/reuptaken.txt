To be more clear (sorry for poor English, but I'm bit stressed): if I sell some BTC on exchange does it still is on my wallet for some time (eg.waiting until transaction gets some number of confirmations)? 
I sold all my BTC yesterday morning.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:59:44
No BTC. Just USD.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:02:25
There should be not only longer time between announcement and trading but also a offer placing (no trading) period which would allow the prices to settle.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:43:43
1. At what time this all started
2. If someone sold all BTC on exchange, does it mean that his wallet is empty?
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:51:53
Let's start with basic question: exactly when this happened? What was the "pace" of withdrawals? Was there any particular order? Which accounts were hacked and which were not?
@_date: 2014-02-15 08:42:42
MtGox has very shitty, very centralized PR.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:50:03
But I assume even in not very professional statements, the assets kept were mentioned, right?
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:46:56
They don't do it.
On the other hand, someone was/is doing pretty big and steady dump on MtGox.
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:40:46
Someone claims he succeeded, but for me it's still not working. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:45:08
OK, C-class movies also need screenwriters.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:33:15
If I had lost $400M+ of other peoples money I would hire good lawyer and good security guys. And I would watch my words and watch my steps very carefully. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:12:47
They should enable withdrawals. Everything else is 100x less important.
Also: I don't really care about MtGox revival.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:51:54
So today's surge from 807.8 to 809.9 wasn't because of breaking news here about grocery store in Ohio which started accepting BTC?
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:14:39
The reality is that price can go up/down 10% or more before your BTC will be available on an exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:16:08
Don't be so obsessed with him.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:23:14
$28 to $1 was incredible.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:47:17
100% right. I suppose that it's mostly people who don't have funds there shouting "let's kill gox now". I won't even use word "compassion".
Gox is like a ship which is led by crazy captain. Should we sink it with all passengers? I doubt.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:40:31
Well, to be honest there were more hacks. But on the other hand their history is pretty long, and as once leading exchange they were exposed more than others.
But people seem to forget ddoses that plagued Bitstamp few moths ago, forgive btc-e that the support is mostly Russian, and we don't know anything about it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:54:00
That's my point exactly. It's not only their "stupidity". If the transfers were more instant they wouldn't do it. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:25:53
No other exchange did it.
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:48:46
It's like:
"What's your argument for or against the current stock price being over inflated by the good news from the company?"
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:03:12
So what, that it was meant to be peer-to-peer? Bitcoin doesn't have p2p exchange functionality built in.
Look, when you give your dollar notes to a cashier, before he gives you back the stuff you paid for, there's a moment you have to trust him. This is what is going on on exchange. Or when you buy something from BTC accepting vendor. 
This is mode of operation of not only Gox but also Kraken, Bitstamp and other exchanges. So talking about Blockchain here is just not relevant. And kind of blaming people that they trust someone is unjust. Maybe they should not keep their money on the exchange for longer than it's necessary – that's for sure.
At one point Antonopoulos mentions a "goxing" which caused that market orders on Gox were executed with 1h lag. 
But what he is not mentioning is that bitcoin network is slow. And while the lag on Gox is inexcusable (the Gox should be probably just switched off, other exchanges also had downtime), process of sending BTC to an exchange takes 30 minutes or more. And this is why people were keeping money on exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:27:02
That's another story. Has nothing to do with your ablity to react when market changes.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:16:13
MtGox only exists because people cannot withdraw money from it. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 22:04:37
My opinion is "price is always right". It is what it is. It cannot be "over inflated". The news is apparently good, so the price rose.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:29:27
Maybe because of Antonopoulos trying to compare Blockchain, with Mt Gox, without mentioning that those are two very different businesses and that all exchanges HAVE to keep user money, and that Mt Gox was not unique in it's approach. 
Whole comparision of exchanges with banks ("not a long term solution" – I've LOL'ed – with all its ups and downs banks were used for storing money for 500? 700? years?) is wrong. Exchange is more like online store. You're absolutely not obligated to keep money there for longer than your transaction is done.
I'm bit tired of hearing how great blockchain.info is. Yeah, it's great, but you cannot buy BTC with it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:19:28
Neither they're are investors nor they "still having trouble" (they just cannot recover anything).
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:04:40
I hope that the keys are lost. But what I'm trying to discuss here is impact of "theft scenario" on whole project.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:12:37
Was rather declining. And we don't know a lot about Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:12:58
And if this would happen to you, you would go with explanations to:
1) police
2) reddit
3) your parents?

It's "fuck you" in Polish, with some errors. He isn't fluent in Polish. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:56:41
There's a lot more options than two (other thing is that we don't have much influence).
But I agree 100% with OP that bankruptcy / insolvency is one of the worst. It's not that Karpeles will lose his money. I don't care about him. Lot of people will lose their money and who I am to judge them if they deserved it.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:20:35


Oh sure, that would help a lot.
@_date: 2014-03-02 08:43:41
Yeah, 6% of bitcoins, big deal, move over it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:40:12
I don't understand the question.
My point is that if market changes so quickly, I'm not able to react if I don't have my money ready on the exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:53:40
We don't know it. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:49:36
This also has impact on others, as you can clearly see. 
And about the speculators: I'm one of them. I don't have single satoshi on Gox (OK, I may have few, less then several cents), but I'm also taking some risk on other exchanges. I'm "just speculator".
@_date: 2014-03-02 11:25:22
Because other people (just like you) spam this subreddit with their  off-topic political bs. This subreddit is not about "libertarians and anarcho-capitalists", and other people view on them. Who cares. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:31:28
This time it didn't have any impact on markets.
Let Karpeles believe what he wants to believe. I don't care much. Maybe he feels like he failed and is blaming others. It's like you caused car accident, but you blame darkness and wet road. Well, the road was wet, but it was your responsibility to drive even more carefully. Maybe it's just excuse he does not really believe himself.
I just think that throwing f*'s at him is pointless and counterproductive. 
He did much harm to BTC image (as MtGox helped a lot to spread BTC in the past). Now what everyone should expect from him is letting people withdraw their own money from the exchange. If he could shut up during this, it would be nice. If he can't, well, I doubt anyone cares.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:28:57
Hey, write your idiotic "6% of bitcoins stolen – this is actually good news!" but don't downvote, you morons.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:35:51
You probably haven't used Bitcoinca. Nor have your BTC lost when Bitomat.pl wallet was deleted. Or talked to btc-e support in Russian.
I'm not saying that Gox performance was stellar. Delayed withdrawals should be alarming to everyone. But this whole ecosystem is not much better.
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:50:28
For what? I'm trying to help panicked people not lose their money.
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:42:56
Really? Upvoting doesn't change the system? What a shame... and what a waste of time...

"When else do Americans open bank accounts or other accounts in Japan? Almost never."
Sorry, but this is stupid even by low standards of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:21:55
And what's the official story?
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:46:23
One possible reason that's rarely mentioned which caused at least some people to keep their money on Gox (or other exchanges) is that bitcoin transfers are SLOW.
It takes up to 1hr (sometimes longer) to transfer your BTC to an exchange which requires 6 confirmations.
During one hour market can go 10% up/down. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:57:00
The topic is more like discussing US government, not dollar. We had even seen here topics (upvoted!) about gun controls and so on.
And I'm not sure if "Bitcoin is a fundamentally anarcho-capitalist financial product". Thats another story.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:08:30
OK, that's my point. 
Blockchain is different animal, so why compare it with Gox?
And banking is "proven" technology with quite well known risks (sorry that I gave it 700 instead of 3000y age). Bitcoin is few years old. Maybe it will be better, time will tell. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:38:58

Techcrunch "Many Mt.Gox investors are still having trouble recovering their money"
Oh, really?
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:32:24
just do it
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:01:59
My point exactly.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:06:57
Sure. 
- Someone will buy MtGox.
- MtGox is solvent, will enable withdrawals, but 95% customers will leave, it will be very marginal exchange, eventually will vanish
- Karpeles will transfer all customers BTC to some random wallet. Then he will destroy public key and kill himself.
and a lot more.
I don't know why people think that press is "not that stupid", but Gox customers are, and after all this Gox will continue to be one of the leading exchanges.
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:58:13
Not really.
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:38:25
Yes, me. I don't remember the exact sum. BTC was not worth much when they gave it back.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:27:41
I hope so. But if I were a merchant selling goods for BTC it would come to my mind: "maybe this guy just paid me with a stollen money?".
And this also gives arguments to those wanting harsher regulations. "Look, 1/20 bitcoins is already 'dirty money'."
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:20:18
Honestly I don't believe in 100% Bitcoin world.
And even if it would happen, the trust won't be taken out of the equation completely.
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:29:41
Yeah, this would help people with funds on Gox. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:59:35
Yes. And it was very convenient for people from Poland, deposits/withdrawals were superfast (few hours). It was one person operation. Exchange was quite convenient while security of funds.... not so much.
Of course it wasn't 100% altruistic. MtGox was using (and perhaps is still using) Bitomat bank account for PLN and perhaps some SEPA (not sure if it's the case) transfers. It wasn't much money back then for Bitomat customers, but I was a huge sum for the owner of the exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:31:15
Fix is coming, market isn't still getting it... great opportunity to get some cheap coins.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:41:52
You mean the topic of this subreddit is "why do I keep seeing comments from people who think that libertarians and anarcho-capitalists..."?
I don't think so. 
The topic of this subreddit is not why OP sees something (this should he disscuss with his eye-doctor/psychiatrist) what "libertarians" think or what other people think of them. I think they do not obey rules, like all other people. They're just bit more narcissistic. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:37:41
Each time Bitcoin economy gets Goxxed, their marketshare goes down.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:18:23
Maybe he just doesn't care that much.
All I'm saying is that between instant death of Gox and Gox as a leading exchange there's a ton of other options.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:37:26


I've said exactly this here before

It's not only about money disparity. It's more about "one criminal" sitting on 6% of future money supply.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:41:25
Not signed. Even if he is guilty, he still (I hope) keeps a lot of people's money. No need to put additional pressure and stress right now. It's not personal, I don't want to "spare" him from the stress, it's just not in the best interest of folks who still have their funds at MtGox. Foundation should decide when the smoke will go down, whether he should be still on board.
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:04:56
Barely legal!
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:40:23
1) Fiat transfers take longer
2) They don't have fiat
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:59:57
So maybe also people will be smart enough not to deal with Gox anymore? Or they will do this with much more caution.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:48:34
Like other exchanges were so stable? 
I clearly remember outages and ddoses that plagued Bitstamp. Btc-e is no poster boy of reliability, too (not even mentioning their nearly not existing support).
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:26:23
We don't. Scale is different.

@_date: 2014-02-28 15:16:59
I think that in this community notion of criminal is somehow different from official and someone trading drugs at the SR may be not regarded as one. But stealing is stealing (of course I can imagine some folks here who think that it's just "hacking").
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:54:48
Anything was stolen?
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:50:32
And BTC price on Gox went down.

It's hard to cashout so much coins.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:14:12
If he did what?
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:33:29
The reason he could do this, is exactly what I said: "because people cannot withdraw money from it."
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:21:13
It's cash deposits were handled by Crypto Sp. z o.o.
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:02:22

Investing when price is high is a proven strategy, working pretty well on trending markets: 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:32:35
They have something similar when you tried to deposit from Poland using Przelewy24 (but without checkbox). Never had any problem depositing btc-e via OKPay.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:32:44
I paid for "faster" transaction on MtGox. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:43:12
I remember laughing about bitcoin at $0.25..
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:06:16
This is a chart you should use:
It is different, you can see that in spring BTC was massively overbought. Also daily price movement was much bigger (on logarithmic scale). In my opinion, if this is kind of bubble, we're in "february" stage (comparing to last „bubble”). Also I doubt it will go so smoothly up, there will be more corrections. But I'm totally bullish.
