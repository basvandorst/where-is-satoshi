Considering Satoshi's wallets are worth multiple billions of usd right now, I doubt it. It remains a mystery how someone can resist that amount of money. An idealist or dead, I would imagine.

That's the short of it. It's not like r/btc got an official announcement, someone just happened to stumble upon a API call that then was removed. Two days ago it was possible BCH was going to be added shortly, yet far from confirmed. This time the speculation paid off.

It's really weird that the US still uses bills that can be washed clear.

He probably would not have the same opinion of blockchain technology as is. Bitcoin is a speculative currency, a store of wealth, a cryptocurrency, you get the idea. There's no denying that investing in Bitcoin has a huge risk associated and the very nature of Bitcoin (open source, easily replicated, vulnerable to attacks from outside, anonymous users, etc.) makes it undesirable for conservative investors. 
Blockchain, on the other hand, is just a technology that has no inherent investment dangers associated, it's totally dependent on how the technology is incorporated. There are a plethora of companies using blockchain technology and it's even become quite a buzzword these days.

I mean, BTC went from a peak of almost 500k transactions a day in December to less than 200k transactions a day right now. Interpret that as you will, those are the factual numbers.
