I read that they advertised cold storage, but did not actually use it.

I also would like to know this answer.

Just read your username.

Is he scheduled to speak?

Already there on GDAX my man

I'd invest in a "Ponzu" scheme. Sounds delicious!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:37:44
Coinbase please get your shit together. Some of us are trying to keep our sanity today.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:40:45
Yes, futures as in "derivatives". Bitcoin futures go live on Dec 10th and 18th for CBOE and CME respectively.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:21:00
I do something similar. Then change the numbers when they ask again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:41
I'm holding my breath for the next 2 weeks, futures could send this parabolic
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:39:18
Woah there, I'm a long time bitcoin hodler. I was simply pointing out the misspelling of "Ponzi" with "Ponzu". Ponzu is a citrus based sauce used in Japanese food.
@_date: 2015-12-06 07:04:26
I remember seeing bitcoin at below $10. Read up on it, seemed like a great idea, decided not to buy because they were "too expensive". Could be living on an island in Thailand if I'd bought.
@_date: 2015-12-12 06:42:51
Slow and steady. Remember, 20 years from now we will all be "early adopters".
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:36:12
Where the memes at? We need meme magic to sustain this growth!
@_date: 2014-11-19 02:11:50
Took me a second, but I remember this from years ago. 
Well done.
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:03:04
Coinbase is the best one I've come across. Their "Bitcoin Vault" is kept on computers that do not have internet access, greatly reducing the risk that those computers will be hacked.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:07:15
How long did it take? I'm seeing my returns shrink each payout.
@_date: 2017-02-16 05:59:15
We can always dream. If I can retire on my bitcoin I will laugh at all the people who said I was crazy. If it goes to zero, I will hope they have forgoten that I ever mentioned it.

I'll sell some at  why not it's so much more than what we have now
@_date: 2017-02-12 08:42:52
Ah yes, excellent point. Coinbase has been known to close accounts if they are associated with gambling sites.
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:22:53
I'm suspecting profit taking at $1,300
@_date: 2017-02-24 02:53:47
Once we hit the moon I'm retiring.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:10:20
How many bitcoin do you believe it will take to retire? I'm asking for . . . a friend.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:21:54
5 bitcoin is still 5 more than most of the population has. Chin up!
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:10:53
Yup, people starting to take profits. China is waking up.
@_date: 2017-02-04 08:43:24

So was everyone else apparently :-(
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:05:08
Oh wtf man
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:55:00
Nothing. Moved out all my coins months ago.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:09:55
HODL for life. This is a momentary dip. Still hurts though.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:47:35
Immensely 
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:57:21
Any follow up for this?
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:12:53
Good news, no news is.
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:48:16
If he did that could be a colossal failure on his part. Or he could retire in 5 years, either one.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:06:52
shit shit shit shit shit
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:28:44
Keep going!
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:55:00
I definitely could have made a lot more money by investing in the right tech stocks, but seeing bitcoin reach new heights always brings a smile to my face. I keep reminding myself that we are ALL early adopters and that the upside has huge potential.

One Million Dollars
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:50:06
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:48:46
If you have any bitcoin at all, you are an early adopter. While the price dips are concerning on a surface level, I'm keeping my eyes fixed firmly on a longer time horizon.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:26:27
Hodling through this uncertainty. I'm positive that bitcoin will come out stronger once we get over this BU debacle.

@_date: 2017-03-10 21:05:35
Here we go, price dump!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:37:08
Probably down due to high traffic, this has happened before
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:38:18
This is the hill upon which we die.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:15:20
Partial outage on Coinbase and Kraken, probably due to the volume of trading.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:16:14
Kraken also down due to trading volume
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:20:20

@_date: 2017-01-21 03:19:36
Invest only what you are willing to lose. Also, you neglect to say how long you expect to be holding.

@_date: 2017-08-30 23:16:45
We've all been there fampai. I found out about bitcoin when it was like $0.25. Did I buy? No.
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:35:28
This could elevate remittances to bitcoin's killer app.
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:54:17
If you want to invest in bitcoin without buying the actual coins, this is the way to go. Having said that, you will experience more value by simply buying bitcoins themselves.
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:31:26
I love Kava, make sure you get the good stuff.

We did it, Reddit
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:12:01
I’ve recorded some questions and answers on kaltoro.com
Article is called “Conversations with a No-Coiner”
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:37:14
Tried to use a link shortener, but Reddit doesn't seem to like that
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:02:44
I agree, I don't expect to convince anyone that Bitcoin is the future in a single conversation. Hell, it took me years to decide to get involved in any capacity, let alone put myself out there publicly and talk about it.
I'm hoping that answering these questions will help those who have yet to hear a convincing answer. The truth is that there is a lack of educational material accessible by the general public. I still have trouble giving away $5.00 worth.
But we have to start somewhere and this is the best way that I know.
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:31:46
Thanks man, the document is still far from over. It CAN be challenging to provide accurate responses without sounding like a used-car salesman.
I would love it if everyone read the Bitcoin Standard but unfortunately, it's difficult enough to get someone read a 3-minute long Medium article and have them come up with a list of questions.
I had my sister watch an Andreas Antonopolous video and she had 0 questions afterwards. 
Hopefully by small-chunking this information it'll be more digestible.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:43:24
Unbelievable, truly an amazing time to be alive 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:03:18
You simply need to have your coins in a wallet in which you hold the private keys, Electrum is a good one. One the fork happens, you should be able to find a tool/tutorial that shows you how to retrieve your new coins.
For the Segwit 2X coins, Coinbase will let you access then within 24-48 hours. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:17:06
Bread is a simple wallet for newbies. It lacks advanced controls (specific fees/satoshi) but is a good first wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:45:59
I will switch over to the iOS version as soon as it drops.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:19:54
Are these free or paid seminars? I've been thinking of offering something like this for my neighborhood. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:07:17
Yes, that is fine. You will still have all the coins from this fork, and any upcoming fork. 
Best wishes in your future Bitcoining!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:01:01
He's an absolute monster for doing this. I may have to go through therapy for at least a year to come to grips with this psychopaths mentality.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:10:46
Thanks, I'll look to see if there are any in my area!
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:51:45
On certain exchanges
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:20:05
I brought it up a few times. Brother in law even had a Coinbase account but never bought any. I gave him $20 worth of bitcoin and told him to hodl it. One day it may pay for his kids education. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:12:41
Yes, you will get an equal amount of "Bitcoin2X". These are being valued by the futures market at about $1,000 per coon. 
Please look up hard fork explanations on YouTube. Andreas Antonopolous has a great explanation.

If we ever get the ETF approved, these people will actually have a product to buy!

Let's not forget, there is a bitcoin beginners subreddit as well. All beginners are welcome!
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:43:48
I'm confused, can you elaborate why this is a ponzi scheme to you?
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:10:38
It's fake money, it has nothing to back it!
@_date: 2017-04-26 00:08:27
I heard about bitcoin when there were no exchanges. Then again when it was under a dollar. Had I spent some beer money on it then, I could have retired. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 18:41:28
Most Impressive
@_date: 2018-11-01 06:23:41
I stepped away from Crypto during that time and ignored the news. Came back when things turned bullish.
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:15:13
Please be real . . .
@_date: 2016-09-11 00:01:32
Try Multibit HD. It does not require downloading the entire blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:42:19
What Joe is describing (buying tickets on blockchain) is what AST is trying to do with their decentralized exchange. Less the specific artist token.
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:02:05
While I applaud your honesty, it is best practice to not disclose how much money you have in crypto
But thank you for sharing 
@_date: 2017-09-03 21:54:44
IMO, a week. We should see $5,000 within 7 days.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:13:52
Thank you for this reply

I'll finally be able to buy real groceries!
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:20:03
I've said before, my personal moon is $1 million per coin. At the point, money would no longer be a concern and we all retire.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:29:28
We would have to see the wallet(s) to verify if it is one person or many people.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:13:19
FUD finally giving way to cooler minds. Let's hope this trend continues.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:59:35
I'm going to need some proof for this claim. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:29:20
We needed this correction to maintain a healthy market. The bull run couldn't be maintained indefinitely. Having said that, it's only a matter of time before we break the $5,000 mark. HODL, my friends.

You mean, if China stopped mining altogether?
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:18:52
Jaxx is also acceptable for a desktop wallet. It can also store other coins like ethereum and litecoin
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:45:48
Please post a screenshot. I want to believe!
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:13:51
I do love his bite sized videos, and would also prefer it if he posted them at full length. I'm sure we could all benefit from his long form talks.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:28:38
Well that's disappointing 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:58:03
Coinbase may take a while for their decisions on these matters, but they seem to be making the correct ones.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:56:31
Is that your "Moon"? Or do you think it will go higher?
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:51:02
Are these normal acorns or 2X acorns?
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:27:28
It's a dip. It sucks. But we always come back stronger. Unless we don't. Then I'm screwed.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:19:04
Not yet, to my dismay
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:41:55
Can you please give a source or evidence that they may exchange all bitcoins in their wallet for the 2x coins? 
Because that is terrifying.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:21:56
You may be thinking or Kiribati
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:43:24
Interesting, I have not heard of RSK yet or the merged mining solution. Can you TL:DR it for me?
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:28:04
I sincerely hope you get to enjoy the fruits of this gamble. As someone with a minimal amount invested compared to this, I am excited for your potential gains.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:28:53
This would be my "Sell All" price. I would probably sell a little bit before it hit that price as well.
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:32:30
This tool is great. There's entirely no reason we can't hit $10,000 based off some very conservative estimates, even if we don't capture that much gold market.
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:10:13
Wild shot in the dark here, mid 2018. We still seem to be a large distance away from any kind of consensus.

Instructions unclear. Sold all my Dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:30:45
Damn, you got me. Having said that, I have had transactions stall in the past because my fee was too low. $1.00 in fees seems to be a sure-fire way to make sure your transactions are processed quickly.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:30:01
As someone who started out with Hashlets, I've been following Paycoin for a while. This feels more like a "Going out of business" sales. I hope I'm wrong, I would love to see this hit $20.

When one BTC is $1 million
@_date: 2016-07-15 02:38:14
Thanks! I was able to do it by following your steps. My issues was that the Bitcoin option was not showing up until I clicked "Add funds to my account". I appreciate the support!
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:22:00
I will do this in a heartbeat if it's easier. My problem is the port forwarding.
@_date: 2016-07-25 04:35:12
1 million dollars
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:50:45
I also expect the price to keep diving down. At this point, it would take a minor miracle to raise the price.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:17:13
Not technically a scam. However, depending on how much you initially invest the fees may become greater than your payout. This will result in zero payouts at that point. IMO it is better to simply buy and hold whatever coins you are planning to mine.
@_date: 2016-07-14 01:52:24
I don't have the bitcoin option available to me when I try to update my payment section. What am I missing here?
