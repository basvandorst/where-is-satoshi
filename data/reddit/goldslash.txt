I recently tried Circle and am disappointed that you must buy bitcoins before spending them. It's an extra step. I'd like to see it so that when you spend bitcoins they are automatically purchased on your behalf using the linked bank account or credit card.

Yes, it does use blockchain.info for a small part of its functionality. I'm not aware of any mobile wallet apps that don't use an API for at least getting the exchange rate. Other wallets (like bitWallet) depend on blockchain.info for sending, and when that site is down, the wallet is useless. Breadwallet deserves a lot of credit for being the first SPV wallet on iOS.

Excellent guide! I'm saving it to my phone so I'll have it to easily share.

I remember reading that the iOS version of Mycelium was developed by a different developer (or team) than the Android version. I am very excited to see it come to iOS.

I think I recognize 4/5: Andreas Antonopoulos, Gavin Andresen, Vitalik Buterin, Roger Ver. Are these correct? Who is the 5th?

Bolivia is the poorest country in South America. I visited there in 2006 and again this year, and I have seen first-hand the orphan children living on the streets. I am not familiar with Kaya Children, but everything looks legit and I encourage you to make a donation.
One of the wonderful things about Bitcoin is that you can send any amount, no matter how small. A few dollars goes a long way in this part of the world.
Bitcoin is banned in Bolivia. If government leaders see Bitcoin doing good things for their people, it can only help to change that.

I was thinking the same thing. Please bring Mycelium to iOS.

Thanks for everything you are doing. I'm very excited to have this in Portland!

I had similar concerns when thinking about how to move cold storage from an Electrum-generated wallet to Trezor. Some code I worked on for this is available on GitHub,

Seeing that there are 3 zeros after the decimal, I would assume that is $50,000. Some countries use a comma in place of a decimal. I hope that's the case here because they must have spent a lot more than $50 just making the video.

I remember it being a big deal when it was announced. I wonder if this has anything to do with Bitcoin's perceived scalability.
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:45:09
I have followed the given instructions and can confirm that this works. MyTrezor web wallet running locally is indeed possible.

Thanks! I've given out a lot of bitcoin (IRL) but this is the first time I have received any. :)

It was announced on October 6th during the keynote address at the Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas. 
On that day, the bitcoin price rose and the XCP price more than doubled!

Its an interesting video with or without the sound. Since its just music the entire time, you won't miss anything by muting your volume before watching.

I agree, but it can't happen until Apple allows developers access to an NFC API. I'm hoping that happens this fall with iOS 9.

You're right about XCP spiking when they announced the Ethereum scripting, but that wasn't until November 12th, after it had already gone up from the Medici announcement.
You can see both announcements if you look at the 180-day chart:

This may be up to your bank partner, but any plans to issue BitPay debit cards supporting EMV? Apple Pay?
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:00:28
Any plans to add push notifications for transactions using the BitPay debit card?

Are the versions available elsewhere (Vimeo, iTunes, Amazon) also 480p?
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:42:20
I have been expecting this to be released as a native app for iOS. What is the status?

If you are moving from pre-2.0 versions of Electrum, you may find this code useful to help with the migration.

The acknowledgement comes roughly one month after rumors of a project shift first surfaced online in remarks made by Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne.
