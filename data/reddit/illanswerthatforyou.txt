I would be willing to bet:
1) The government has already cracked Tor
2) Better yet they probably didn't need to crack it. Chances are they were able to compromise it from the beginning or they wouldn't have funded it.
3) They don't want to show their hand. They won't reveal this to prosecute petty drug dealers or pedos. 
4) This is probably one of their greatest intelligence assets. They wont let it be destroyed.

AFAIK yes. There are probably headers or other stuff in the wallet.dat that identifies it as a wallet even if the data is encrypted. If your attacker is skilled enough he can see those.  If you want to create a file that is indistinguishable from random data you should use a TrueCrypt container.

No. As Cowboy_Coder said it might be integrated with existing services, but it won't become one on it's own.
Bitcoin transaction aren't reversible. We all know how stupid the average consumer it. The reasons Credit Cards caught on so well isn't just convenience, it's because they add a lawyer of "fraud protection" (stealing from the merchant) on as well. If the customer is dumb enough to get their stuff stolen and someone uses their card they can steal their stolen money back.

You never know. An insurance company might be interested as long as the proper terms were in place. For example the policy would not cover losses due to market variance, a problem with the Bitcoin protocol itself, or legal risk. It would only cover specific circumstances such as theft, nationalization, war, natural disaster, or things of that nature.

Because you're being too specific. In Kurzwile's book he's talking in a more broad sense. Is the idea behind Bitcoin ($oIP, decentralization, and so on) going to be subject to the law of accellerating returns? Almost definitely. Is Bitcoin itself? Possible, but I won't put my life savings on it.
Bitcoin is one potential technology and you never know what is around the corner. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:54:18
* What happens to Bitcoins that are "lost"?
Exactly what it sounds like. They cease to exist which in turn lowers the overall amount of Bitcoin in existance resulting in the average price per Bitcoin going up. Less supply and the same or more demand means a higher price. Fortunately Bitcoins are currently divisible by up to 8 decimal places, which means if each Bitcoin becomes prohibitively expensive (like $10,000 each) you can just move the decimal place over a few spots and be trading smallers parts of a Bitcoin for $10 each.
And yes, this is inherent *deflation* not *inflation*. One of the big arguments against Bitcoin is that it will eventually experience runaway deflation. People buy more Bitcoin because the price is going up so people buy more Bitcoin until the whole thing collapses. Google "Tulip Mania"
* Does bitcoin favor early adopters?
Yes, it most certainly does.
* How do you handle rural areas?
Hypothetically a Bitcoin just consists of private and public keys. If you print a private key which holds one Bitcoin on a piece of paper your paper is now worth 1 Bitcoin. This means you can hand it to someone like cash. 
Realistically? You don't.
* How do you deal with people without computers?
See the previous answer.
* What about the growing size of the blockchain?
There are solutions that are being worked on to combat this issue. People may start using 3rd party services to handle their wallets (Blockchain.info and Electrum for instance) or in the future they will be able to download limited versions of the blockchain (called "pruned" versions of the blockchain, I think).
* Isn't there a great deal of transaction lag?
A *transaction* is instant. *Confirmation* of a transaction is not. Confirmations are basically to prevent double-spends of the same Bitcoins. The number of confirmations is directly proportional to the chance that you received a double spend. After 6 confirmations there is practically 0 chance that the transaction can be reversed unless the person has 51% of the power of the Bitcoin network.
Most merchants and merchant processing services are using a risk-based system to handle confirmations. Personally If I'm selling something for 5 bucks there is a very small chance that someone will go through the technical trouble to double-spend against me, so I will accept 0 confirmation transaction. It's instant. As the amount I am receiving goes up so does the number of confirmations I require before I consider the money "cleared". If I was to receive anything over, say, $10,000 I would require 6 confirmations.
* And lastly, when is the right time for ME to join in?
You've already answered this question for yourself.
If you truly believe that Bitcoin will gain wider acceptance that means you truly believe that there will be more demand. If there is more demand the price will continue to increase. If the price will continue to increase then the time to get in is NOW.

Yeah it would be nice wouldn't it? Unfortunately things are a bit more complex than that in the real world.
In the real world you have to deal with things called customers, fraud, and trust. 
A credit card company can tell one of their customers "Hey if you're an idiot and your card gets stolen because, well, you're an idiot, you don't have to pay for it! We steal from the merchant instead!" and the merchant has to smile and nod and say "Thank you sir, may I have some more?"

Transaction fees are voluntary, but on that same note miners can choose the blocks that they want to mine. If a block has more transaction fees chances are it will be mined first. This gives incetives to people to include a larger fee in their transaction.
Right now fees don't really matter due to the fact that the block rewards are enough. Once blocks run out you can expect no-fee transactions or no-fee blocks to take forever and thensome to confirm.

SWIFT is just a messaging system. It allows the sending bank to send a secure message to the receiving bank saying "Hey dude, I'm sending $XXXXX.XX your way". That's easy. The settlement portion of a transfer is why it's so expensive. 
From my understanding the current wiring system relies on intermediary banks for settlement which can be complex, especially if changing currencies on the way (as is what happens with most international wires). 
So both the sending and receiving bank need to have accounts at another bank that they share. What if the banks don't share a bank? Well the bank the bank banks at needs to have an account at a bank that that the other bank bank's bank banks at. You see why this gets complicated. Complexity is also why wire transfers are so expensive.
Changing currencies also opens up banks to market variance risk. What if the currency becomes worth less on the way? Which bank eats the loss?

No. All major credit card companies have sections of their fine print dedicated to this. They say a consumer cannot waive their right to issue charge back. 
However this doesn't prevent a merchant from entering into a contract *outside* of the credit card transaction with the customer. This contract can be about chargebacks. It can create liability for the customer in the event that they issue a chargeback against you. 
For instance it can say something like "If you issue a chargeback against GeneriCorp you agree to pay GeneriCorp $XXX.XX for their time in responding to this chargeback.  You agree to be sent to collections in the event that this sum is not paid in XX days. You understand that being sent to collections negatively impacts your credit yatta yatta" 
Then all you have to deal with is the fraud associated with the credit card transaction and the differences/enforcability of contract law across multiple countries. The above doesn't work if you're in America and they are not. It also doesn't work if the credit card is stolen so you have to properly verify identity.

The cost of a chargeback is much more than the cost of the merchandise. PayPal charges you a $25 chargeback fee, as do most credit card processors. Then you have to deal with potentially getting your account and/or funds frozen. Plus it costs a flat $0.30 off the bat to make the transaction in the first place.
Microsales of Bitcoin aren't worth it. Minisales (Say 0.1 BTC) might be. Depends on your risk mitigation techniques.

Yes, but not easily. Paying through PayPal gives you all of the consumer protection. If he scams you you can issue a chargeback against him. Once you tell PayPal that you were buying Bitcoin they will freeze both accounts. He probably has more to lose than you do.
