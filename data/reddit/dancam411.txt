Currently the fees are astronomical. It's trying to charge you $14 for the transaction fee and that is more than you have in your account

I only have 1 photo id so I can't even get into my GDAX account :( I'm basically forced to keep it in coin base or loose $50

I'm just new to bitcoin too but I believe GDAX will charge 0 fee

I would feel 100% fine. Ive invested only what I can afford to lose. Basically I had saved up for a PC part for a while and was gonna get it boxing day and decided that instead id spend half of it on bit coin and save the rest. Worst case I wait another half year to get the part. Best case I walk away with a ton of extra cash.

No one can say for sure. Best bet with coin base is transfer the BTC to your GDAX account (no fee to do this) then transfer from GDAX to your wallet

Think of the transaction fee like the surge pricing on uber. When the network is busy the price goes up!
Because bitcoin is on everyone's news feed right now the interest and orders have gone crazy so it is expensive
