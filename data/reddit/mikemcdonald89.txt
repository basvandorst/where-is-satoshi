He has been around crypto 4 or 5 years.
But 4+ years ago he was too busy being the undisputed  headsup poker player in the world for crypto to be the best use of his time. Now he's too busy with crypto for poker to be worth his time

He's just so far down the rabbit hole that he no longer considers fiat to be currency.
Probably owns 900,000 bitcoin

Remember, Wall Street can only make the price tank if you don't panic sell?

That's actually very interesting and would assuredly make an eventual shift much simpler than I'd have imagined

I've gotten many friends into bitcoin but have a pretty poor handle on how large their investment should be before recommending they buy a Trezor.
What do most people recommend? It's one thing to take a risk that I've weighed for myself but it's another risking a friend's money if they don't control their own keys and/or may not fully appreciate the risks involved. I feel guilty for preventing them getting more coins if the total they want to spend on crypto is too low, and feel guilty putting them at risk of losing it all if the amount they spend on crypto is too high

This is one of the biggest issues regarding bitcoin's growth. I feel bitcoin should either have one large "stock split" or 2 medium splits. I think the following options would both help bitcoin's growth
a) Begin referring to 1 millibit as 1 coin tomorrow 
b) Begin referring to 10 millibits as 1 coin tomorrow and 100 bits as 1 coin in a few years once it seems appropriate
In my experience the bitcoin community spends too much effort debating minor changes so I'm sure this will never happen but our brains are wired to like numbers more than 1 a lot more than numbers a lot less than 1. If tomorrow we replaced the value of $1 with $1,000,000,000,000 I think there would be virtually no emphasis on some superstar athlete getting paid $0.00032 or a fancy car costing $0.0000001
