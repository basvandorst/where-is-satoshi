That's the right attitude, my man!

Seriously, flagged for removal for sharing my enthusiasm and investment? WTF? I see these kinds of posts all the time - why is mine arbitrarily wrong?

Why do most people only have their respective country's currency at their bank? ;)

This assumes ambiguity, that it's 50/50 - those with foresight know it isn't so, however, and this a definite probability. It is calculated, it doesn't have unknown variables to the more astute. You should stop this hysteria that belittles a rational approach to demotivate the market! Perhaps you lack the strength and bravery, I don't know, but by most reliable predictions, this route is certain.

I'm the embodiment of enthusiasm about this currency  - taking the bull by the horns, unbuttoning my pants - and people are downvoting such positive fanfare when here to positively share their experience on it?!? Regardless, GREED IS GOOD, it's INDIVIDUAL EMPOWERMENT against these external systems from the damn sly politics, manipulative corporations and the repressive banks: I'll be enjoying my yacht on Lake Como as y'all indulge in awful negativity online.

See, they say Bitcoin has no security, but look at this big man's confidence, I love it!

They lack courage and act as cautious fools. Could you imagine investing in Microsoft around 1980? Yep.

Exactly, you're a concept man - you see the big picture in practice here! You have the vision and that's the vision which will liberate us more from a financial system that's only accountable to itself! This is us taking control of our means!

Would you prefer a redhead or blonde, mate? ;) Do you want it to be raining as an excuse to go down? With my bold wealth generation, I'll have the money for weather manipulation technology! (KIDDING)

That sure is a common maxim for investment, but my optimism here knows no bounds - it's worth no mitigation, it's a singular endeavor that's worthwhile! Once I win big as everyone knows will happen and is supported here with much testimony, I'll be the first to follow more orthodox investment strategies - this isn't for that, it's the big shot.

So, it's a pyramid scheme that will crash when no more users may reasonably sustain it?

I said it 'reminds me' - not that it is. I think it's the optimistic proverbs and fanaticism. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:12:32
These are all interesting points - some astute, others fallacious. Incidentally, I don't understand certain people becoming defensive, it's unnecessary when this is a fair consideration which is intriguing to explore/discuss. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:15:22
This cultish mentality reminds me of a pyramid scheme with the participants in denial. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:13:46
Don't forget diversification as a maxim to any investment strategy. A proverb I like, too, is, "If the bird knows the word, the word's burnt".

Hi Satoshi. It's been a while.
