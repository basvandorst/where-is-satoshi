Won't sell under 80k.

Relax. We need you. Imagine the explosion that's about to take place.

Russia is joining in soon. HODL. We're at future ground level now.

BTC dropped like 1k in a few minutes. Some people are drawing cash and the servers can't handle it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:27:06
Aaand it's gone!

Don't trust me, I'm just a random guy on the Internet. But mark my words, we're going up and beyond.

It's a typo from HOLD as you panic and try to convince your crypto-buddys that there are better times to sell out.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:23:24
Jeez forgot about that. That's gonna be a looong night.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:01:08
Why so shy. We've got a long way to go.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:55:31
Nah it's fine. It's almost 6 o'clock in Asia. They won't pass on that.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:52:56
Absolutely. But I think this will last till next week when we hit about 20k. Russia joins in, we hit 60-80K. Another spike and back down all the way to like \~12k.

That's exactly what I need rn. Brb just of to the gas station for two packs of Marlboro and some chewing gum.  
Need anything?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:52
Still not down to HODL gang.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:47:58
This is just some anxiety. People cash out on some of their coins. Grab a drink, lay your head to rest and wake up to 15k tomorrow &lt;3
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:54:25
This still is low when you compare it to next week.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:11:43
We're not done here. It's 6 o'clock in Tokyo. We're going strong again in a few hours.
