Prove yourself you are not troll. Burden of proof is on you. Your negative karma tells that you are a troll and everyone dislikes your comment.

Never worry. It is always first time for all things for all people.

I think this is the first Bitcoin conference in Asia still not getting the exposure it should have.

NSA is meant to prevent attack on the US soil and that is what it did successfully. You see everywhere islamic terrorists have been attacking but they failed in the US. Why? because NSA new them.

I think BitSyncom is better option than a typical desktop computer for Bitcoin mining as here you make $200-$300 per day.

How will you determine if your donation in Bitcoin has not exceeded fifty dollars when it is fluctuating from fifty dollars to three hundred dollars.

How is it a challenge? PayPal is charging even more than this and yet customers are falling for it. Coinvoice is a new company but they can be good option for Argentinians as the article says.

He is fucking moron; he does not understand the basic concept of Bitcoin is like this.

Are not they using NSA to fight back terrorism?
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:06:50
This guy is shitting in every thread and every post; IDK what is actual problem. If he hates the sub-reddit leave that man. Why shitting everywhere.

The director of the National Security Agency insisted that the government's sweeping surveillance programs have foiled some 50 terrorist plots worldwide in a forceful defense echoed by the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee.

The consulting firm is so young. i just came to know about this fact! The people running it are just two youngsters. Appreciated.

Some companies generated circumstances like this that no body trusts when it comes to Bitcoin Mining machines and their pre-orders.  I do not say this company is like that. You need to be cautious.

Yea, it is up now.

One of the speakers is Brett Scott. I think he is genius. I read his book ‘The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money' and quite liked it for this is an imaginative, even exuberant exploration of the daunting world of finance.

After 911 there has not been any attack on the US soil that is because NSA has been able to track terrorists before they could strike. I am no fan of NSA but it definitely has played a role in saving many of the US lives.

May be he or she is pissed off with Bitcoin. May be she sold them cheap and now repenting when Bitcoin has gone beyond $300.

Yes, Winklevoss twins failed in Bitcoin venture. I hope he survives. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 08:03:27
At least he is not selling drugs. People like Robertson need more recognition than the companies like Silk Road.

Venture capitalists need to come to support Bitcoin startups. I mean it is difficult in the shark pool to survive without much fund. Even Bitmit had to face several problems.

I read that interview some time ago. A decent interview, quite less common for a young chap. He is bright. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 06:08:14
Let us hope something great comes from this young genius. I think he can make it given his kind of mind. Good luck dude. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:49:07
Though I support about the funding thing, if you talk about evidence, you cannot have any tangible evidence because they were averted. You will have to believe this. If 911 was averted there would not have been any evidence at all.

This man is a real trouble. Wherever he goes shit comes from his mouth.

What are other options you suggest?
@_date: 2013-10-13 10:41:00
That is fucking beyond my understanding, if you fucking don't understand why care to criticize it. Ripple is giving wider choices for customers where Bitcoin is not reaching, simple.

Yes, Bitcoin is banned in Thailand. 
The Bank of Thailand declared Bitcoins illegal on Monday, making it the first country to ban the virtual currency.
According to an online statement by Bitcoin Co. Ltd., which facilitates the trading of the currency, the ruling came after months of meetings between the company and Thailand's central bank. Thailand's Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department ultimately decided on the ban "due to lack of existing applicable laws, capital controls and the fact that Bitcoin straddles multiple financial facets."
Essentially all activities involving Bitcoins have been rendered illegal, including buying and selling Bitcoins, using Bitcoins to buy or sell goods online, and sending or receiving Bitcoins from outside the country.
