Do you even realize that people like you are why we have Trump for a president? 
There was no illl intent there. Why do you feel the need to REEEEE on about it? Stop being a jackass and acting like it's cool to be offended.

This right there should be the part that matters. Don't you find it a bit belittling for people to point out the success of women simply because they're female? It's the equivalent of saying "she's doing really well, for a girl."
I myself was an electrical engineering student, and I saw first hand the gender gap. I'd say the students were about 80% male, 20% female in that subject. No one was stopping females from applying from the program, that's just the way it was.

Some animals are more equal than others apparently. 
I've never seen a SJW who grasps the idea of equality. They're all for special treatment, which is the exact opposite of equality. 
Actual equality is not focusing on things like skin color or gender, instead they make it their sole mission in life to harp on people's differences every chance they get.

Why the shifting goalposts? First it was that there are less women in tech. When I pointed out there is absolutely nothing stopping women from pursuing these degrees but the fact is that they just don't choose the major as often, then it became "well it's harder to get hired." When I pointed out that women are much more likely to get hired than an otherwise equally skilled man suddenly it became about treatment. 
I'm not trying to say that men aren't often being sexist idiots. I don't think anyone would deny that. But to get past that stupidity we need to talk about gender LESS, not more. The more you make it a big deal, the bigger deal it becomes. It's a self fulfilling prophecy.

LOL what? What kind of sheltered special snowflake shit is this? 
The world is not, and should NOT be, a safe space.
 If you can't deal with some cursing on the internet how the hell do you function in real life? I bet you're one of those idiots that runs around talking about trigger warnings and microagressions.

So why not focus on what she does instead of her gender? It makes exactly ZERO difference that she's a woman. 
So why is that the title of the article? I'll tell you why, clickbait SJW bullshit.  You're the one who is actually disrespecting her by harping on gender. Might as well have called it "Shelia's doing really well, for a girl."

This right here says a lot about why you might be finding yourself in these shitty situations. As much as you might not like what that poster had to say, they were right. In a world that's truly equal that's exactly how things work. 
What you're talking about now is just life. Dealing with shitty personal biases and egos is just a part of having to deal with the human race. Perhaps it's not your gender but your attitude that was hurting you. A boss choosing someone else for a promotion is not necessarily the fault of your vagina. It's really seeming like you just want to play the victim, and I bet that attitude carries over into real life. Maybe that's the reason you didn't get promoted. Doesn't play well with others. Maybe the guy is just a dick and was just giving his buddy a promotion. Or maybe you really just didn't deserve it.

I'd make the argument that in this age of "diversity" it's actually much easier for a female to get hired than a man with the exact same qualifications. 
Also, I don't think I'd agree that simply being a female in tech is an accomplishment any more than it is for a male. The accomplishment is getting the degree, not picking it in the first place. Females simply do no choose tech as a major as often as males do. There are exactly zero barriers to entry based on gender, no one is saying "LOL you can't do that, you're a girl."

But, does that mean this comment is right or wrong? If reddit says that reddit is always wrong then.... my head hurts.

You don't want an off grid (battery) system. That is a huge money sink that would perform very poorly with mining power draws. What you want is a grid tied system that uses inverters or micro inverters to feed back into the grid giving you credit on your bill
 I can go into more detail if you like.

What wattage are the panels you're looking at? How much power do you use in an average month? And where is this located?

If you're going to insult someone's intelligence, at least try to spell the insult correctly. 
Do you need a hug?
