Its pretty commonly accepted that FIFO is 100% safe. There is guidance that says LIFO is OK for a capital asset. If there was an IRS circular that stated LIFO is OK for crypto then you would be 100% safe. For most people this is deferring the tax burden until later, but its pretty safe to use LIFO and I wouldn't worry about that.

This is commonly referred to as the specific share identification method. I would be really cautious using this, as it is only specifically allowed in very specific terms for other capital assets. In lack of guidance, I am afraid you could be found later to have more liability than you are claiming.

A very simple analogy is to imagine a room full of boxes with mail slots. Each box is numbered and there is also a lock which can open the front of the box.
People can slip any amount into the slot of any numbered box. The person who has the keys can also do that AND open the front and take out whatever is in there.
The room is the wallet. The box numbers are the public address and the keys, well they are the private keys.

Thanks, good stuff. And by the standards used to determine the performance of the investor in the study, what I am saying about trading in btc would come out as a "break even", neither making nor losing "money". allow me to illustrate (with rounding and my currency for ease of the illustration).
As an example, if one of the day traders purchased 100 shares in the morning at $1 and sold all that afternoon at $0.97 the transaction is both a gross and net loss.
If the same investor sold 100 shares in the morning at $1 and later that afternoon purchased 103 shares at $0.97, the transaction would be a gross wash and a net loss. The exchange fees would provide the loss.
If the investor sold 100 shares in the morning at $1 and later purchased 103 shares at $0.96, then the transaction is a gross wash and a net wash (assumes fees are 0.1% as used in the study and no sales tax)
Its is still an "unprofitable" trade.  No gain in $ was realised.  But buy-and-hold only works if the expectation of a long-term price increase comes true.  So if that does come true, which would you rather have, the number of btc that you originally bought, or a greater number?
I will continue to pursue "unprofitable" trades that result in a higher btc balance because I also believe in a long term price increase.  So it is essentially the same as buy-and-hold, just utilising the asset bought instead of letting it sit there doing nothing.
You have to switch the way your mind thinks and quit using "profit" as defined in the fiat currency of your country and start thinking of "profit" in terms of the number of btc you have.

I would think that traders would be salivating at the volatility. If the price doesn't change, how do you make money trading?
@_date: 2014-07-20 21:26:27
Yes I realise that if every other person in the world was educated to the point of attempting to do the same type of trading that it would fail.  Its a game that relies upon a greater fool.  Encouraging others to do what has been successful for me actually reduces my chances of continuing to succeed.
It is just fashionable for people to rush in with their "great" upvote-garnishing advice here on reddit.  This is currently "buy-and-hold", because we all know the long term price is gong to rise, amirite?
So if the for-sure impending price rise is so guaranteed and that makes "buy-and-hold" such a worthy strategy of pursuing, why would a strategy of increasing the amount of btc you are holding be rejected with such hostility?
It's the same strategy.  Its like if you make a couple of trades a month you are suddenly this cray cocaine snorting "day trading" loser who is stupidly gambling away all his life savings.  So here come all the top hat and fedora wearing white knights who rush in to save this poor lost soul with their shitty advice about buying and holding.
Lets say you were a dealer in classic cars.  And you specialise in 1958 corvettes.  So you buy one and put a cover over it and park it in the back of your shop and greedily lick your chops at the prospect of the impending rise in the price of 1958 corvettes.
People call you wanting to rent that out for $500/day for weddings and shit but you angrily slam the phone down yelling NO, I am buying this car and holding it!!!!
Meanwhile, I collect corvettes also.  But I like to believe that my hard earned money that I used to purchase this asset still has residual value in the asset itself.  So I know that renting my corvette out is going to cause wear and tear to the tune of $300/day in terms of the resale value. My insurance for liability exposure and all my other costs add up to $100/day.
So I rent out my corvette for $600 a day and use the proceeds to eventually purchase another one.  Now I have 2 cars and admittedly one is worth less than the other.  Maybe I part that one out since the resale on parts is more profitable than the whole car.
But the point is that I put my asset to work.  Sure, you may not have the time or energy to put your car out on the market and reap the rewards.
But telling everyone else carte-blanche that buying corvettes and parking them is far superior to renting them out (and using the proceeds to obtain more) is just silly.
That is my point.  Not that everyone needs to trade.  Just that telling everyone not to trade is dumb advice.  It will get you the upvotes, but my motto is don't applaud, throw money.

If you believe that someone with a mortgage is actually an owner, I have a story. Several years ago my empire crumbled and I got behind on my payments. I cashed out some retirement and notified my bank that I was going to catch up on my balance, including late charges, within the next ten days. I sent the payment in on day  7, representing 6 months of house payments. When I checked the balance online, it had not changed. So I called and was told "we received your payment". Thought I was good And didn't bother to re-check. 
About a month later the sheriff presented a notice of foreclosure. I was told by the bank that the foreclosure was filed "the day before" my payment was received. Yeah right. They would not accept a pretty decent short sell offer. The market had tanked by then.  I lost it.
They were allowed to keep the payment "to offset the foreclosure costs". So much bullshit.   Ten grand down the drain to a fucking bank that already has more than I will ever see. 
The culture of debt is a huge trap. Everyone is merely a renter until the last payment or a sell. And the landlords call the shots

If there is a run up then the stop loss kicks in and a new trade is initiated with an even greater chance of succeeding during the retracement.
Just always trade with the goal of completing a trade with more btc than you had before.  Nobody is trading and siphoning off enough fiat to live on, that is a myth.  Just do conservative return trades at a greater frequency and after each successful trade you have an itty bit more bitcoin and over time it adds up nicely. sell high, buy low and more.

Why buy and hold when you can take a portion of your holdings and trade them off for more coin?  You have an asset. Put it to work. The price swings are there. No reason not to take advantage of it. While I agree with the post that dice sites and alts etc. are a waste of time, there is no reason not to increase your btc amount as you wait for long term rise in price.
Just sell at high volume peaks, set a stop loss, and buy back 3% or 4% more btc when the price drops 4% or 5%. 
In this same time period mentioned by OP, I have used 10% of what I own to increase my overall holdings by 10%.  In the ten years you referenced, I will have 4 times more btc than if I just bought and held.

Just be ok knowing that there ARE definitely good reasons why doing that is not so easy and it is all based on the cost and ability of the various exchanges to withdraw your cash.
You could sell your btc on the higher exchange and wait for a long time to actually receive the money. In the mean time, the price of btc is varying enough to justify just leaving it where it was originally and profit there.
If you were prescient enough to perform your trade at the onset of a verrry long bearish downturn, one yet unseen, then you would be a hero.  But good luck with that.

Wrong. Frankeh the notorious troll was speculating that deregulation was responsible for allowing Madoff to get away with his scams.  My point is that he was regulated by a government agency for decades prior to any sort of "deregulation", which in this context would probably be represented by the switch from the NASD to FiNRA, which occurred in 2007.
So in this scenario, we are expected to believe that Madoff was a fine and upstanding guy who followed the law for 47 years in business and then suddenly in 3 years after "deregulation" he is suddenly the biggest financial crook of all times?

This lowers the price at which I can gobble up all the GBTC I can get my hands on.  This is why I say that:
ETF gets approved = better chance for Shillbert's IPO to be approved.  GBTC trades on NYSE Arca.  COIN now just like another exchange.  Price goes up.  I am unsure how the SEC could approve of one fund and deny all others that are structured similarly.  You will see 3-4 ETF's  should COIN be approved.
ETF gets denied = GBTC still remains as a viable option.  Price goes up.
ATM, GBTC and COIN are not similar products.  Should COIN start to exist, they will be.

Currently Coinbase is not an exchange.  They are a fixed-rate seller/buyer.  You give them money and they take that money and go out on the market and purchase the amount that you bought, using your money.
An exchange is simply a platform that serves to bring outside buyers and sellers together.  So on the Coinbase Lunar exchange, if I wanted to buy some btc, then I would be buying it from someone else on the exchange who is willing to sell it to me (or anyone else wishing to pay that price).
So the difference is like being a middle-man to the exchange, versus just setting it up and letting the exchanges take place.

There is a different price used by coinbase for buying and selling.  This is their internal buying or selling price.  Fees are added/taken out of that for the total amount paid or received. They are not an exchange, so they can name the price.

Bought at $110-113.  Price has no correlation. All the activity is in the mornings. Low liquidity. Leads to swing trades in the 100-200% range over monthly time frame. but you want to keep some shares because you can get the IPO price usually reserved for select institutional investors, should the ETF be approved. 
So you want to get exposure to that but stash away as much fiat profit in the mean time as an ETF approval will definitely lead to lower price when its pegged to NAV. You can then buy more shares at the IPO.  Very speculative maybe 50/50 chance or less. But probably higher odds than the winklevii ETF

GBTC is a trust that is not subject to SEC rules regarding an ETF. Basically they have a pool of around 230,000 bitcoin that they have custody of, and by buying a share you in turn "own" a fractional amount of that pool.
They do have the framework of an ETF drawn up and submitted for SEC approval, currently on hold while regulatory agencies sort through their list of demands that must be in place for a bitcoin ETF to be approved.
Existing shares would be converted to the new ETF shares, so the often repeated "shrinking premium" argument is a myth imo.

Cryptodad here. I have been in it for 5 years and although I have made my investment decisions clear to my kids, ultimately its up to them to choose their own path.
The most important thing is that they realize the potential as an investor and see real-life benefits to that.
My son hit college-age right at the time the 2007/2008 financial crisis had completely wiped me out. I told him: look, here is all I got left for you. 25 grand in a TD ameritrade account and its gifted to you. Your education will cost 3x to 4x that amount. Invest wisely.
And guess what. That sumbitch picked 3 winners that did over 30% for the entire run. He entered residence life to save on costs and ended up the director with the sweetest pad on campus. All paid for and even had some left over for his wise investing.
I am so proud of him and I hope that his knack for that will elevate his standing going forward. He did it on his own with no help from me (hell most of it was against my actual advice).
Love you Conor, you are the best.

This is established by you. It is treated similar to the way a manufacturing facility handles their inventory. You can treat it as FIFO (first in first out) or LIFO (last in first out) with FIFO being the typical case.  Once you choose the method of accounting for the time, you must stick with that from year to year. You can't use FIFO one year then switch to LIFO.
So every time you sell some you have to go back and figure out when you acquired some to be able to sell it later. Then keeping track of what's coming in and what's going out and tying it all down with dates.
They have no records of when you bought or sold, but they can track the money entering and/or exiting your bank accounts and they could subpoena or demand your records from any exchange accounts you have.

Not exactly correct. Any bitcoin you sell or use as a purchase of goods is taxed *at the same level as ordinary income* if you held the btc for less than a year. If you held it more than a year, it is taxed *at the rate for a capital gain* in your tax bracket.
If you have less than $37,800 in ordinary income for 2017, the capital gains rate for that tax bracket is 0. An example showing how capital gains leads to lower tax burdens.

I am pretty new too, but the coinbase price seems to be pegged pretty close to the bitstamp exchange rate every time I look. Maybe somebody knows which exchange they actually use to buy/sell.
The fee on coinbase is pretty comparable to the fees on the exchanges in the volume of a $400 transaction. For larger transactions, I would go to an exchange.
When you are ready to sell there will probably be a similar discrepancy in the price.

It means that you are buying a set amount of BTC with no idea what the price quote is going to be. So whatever the price they determine is the quoted price at 9:49 on 11/22 is, that is what will be deducted from your account.
As far as what exactly "market" price is, I am unsure if Coinbase sets that or if it is tied to any exchange. Either way it seems like a bad order to place.

Not a big fan of coinbase. I would open an account at campBX and use the ACH withdrawal method to deposit the money in your folks account for the phone bill. Cost is $2, but you can accept bitcoin at the same account and trade enough btc to pay for your phone maybe.
You can't switch/change the account info using the ACH withdrawal or it flags you, but if you need something to deposit money without the other party taking part, then you'll have to do something like that
tbh I would just sign some forms that link your accounts and transfer the money over every month, like a billpay

I am from your parents generation, so the intricacies and technology behind bitcoin are tough for me to process as well. There was a time when each individual's personal knowledge was basically measured in terms of their ability to grasp a concept and then memorize it for a long time.
Things are different now. I like to compare it to the way one would have previously researched and studied a concept, say in the 80's, versus doing the same thing today. If I wanted to learn and become an expert at something like geology when I was your age, I would be limited to going to the library and check out a book that provided *one person's* analysis of rocks and minerals and how they were formed. My knowledge of geology at that point would match theirs. Then I would maybe check out another and get a different viewpoint. Repeat.
In this day, there are resources that collect the wisdom of many. many viewpoints and assemble them all together at the speed of light and available in an instant without even getting out of your pajamas. 
At some point, you have to place a great value on the ability of many, many people to achieve a collective wisdom about a topic that you personally are somewhat ignorant about. Believe me, people of my generation have a hard time with this. Don't fall into this trap.
The market (all the people collectively with a stake), have determined that bitcoin does indeed have great value and you have personally born witness to this with your windfall.  It appears that there is nothing about the concept that will face immediate legality issues, and everything is taxed. Your parents will likely pay a much bigger tax on the gain, since they are in the higher tax brackets. Bitcoin has appreciated steadily in the 2 years you have held it. There is no reason to believe it will vaporize in the next couple of years until you are 18. There is the chance it will continue to  appreciate. I believe the collective wisdom that has led to the previous increase is valid and should not be ignored. At this time, the potential for a decrease from where you are at is far outweighed by the potential for increase *in the long term*, say a couple of years.

imo, it is just as easy to set up an account at one of the exchanges and wait for your deposit to clear, as it is going to coinbase and waiting for your "pending" transactions to clear. There is not a significant difference in the turnaround time.
They give a false sense of being quicker and easier and this appeals to people who feel they might be missing out on a good opportunity to buy. But when your transaction gets cancelled, it is just a huge waste of time. And the fees are higher.
Good luck and welcome aboard

My avice is to go ahead and start setting up your accounts at any of the exchanges or the fixed-rate sellers like Coinbase.

Oh I see, the question now is what the scam is, not how coinbase reacts to it. Got it. 
Because nobody ever counterfeited cash. Because credit card info has never been stolen. Nobody ever wrote rubber checks. 
There is a bit of scammer in all of us. I believe coinbase to be the scammer at this point. If you have data that shows that the price of the trade has no effect on the decision to cancel the trade, then I think we would all welcome that data.
I won't get my hopes up for that.

I have to imagine this one in anthropomorphic form. There is a big room, full of potential buyers (bids) and sellers (asks). They are like gangs with their colors. One side of the room is the buyers, wearing green satiny jackets and on the other side the sellers, in red. Now they are not here to fight, but to trade. Armed with fistfuls of cash, they meet in the middle to agree on a trade.
Now this chart just shows us which side is swelling in numbers and how close they are as a group to meeting in the middle. If the price is getting close to the price that many people wish to sell at, then the red line will surge toward the center like a wave of people pushing forward. You can imagine that it will take many more trades to satisfy all these people who wish to sell (a sell wall). Now if a potential seller changes his mind and wishes to drop out, he must switch his red jacket to a green one. And reverse for the buyers. A decrease in the outstanding sell order has the same effect as an increase in the buy orders.
So if the price is moving in a certain direction, up or down, you can see whether the outstanding orders will tend to maintain that direction or change it. I don't find it very useful, except in the very short term. But I don't trade in short term either.
So it is a chart that shows the cumulative changes to the outstanding buy and sell orders over a specific time period.

Have seen some shit. For example the economic crash such of late 07, when I had 5 mortgages, 2 restaurants, and I built subdivisions. My economic ruin was inevitable and swift.
However, and I think this applies pretty universally, there were benefits to me that would never have happened without going through that. Families rallied and became a bigger part of each other's lives. People became conscious of the toll of stress and decided to do without. Priorities changed.  All good things.
So call it going down with the ship or a much needed swim, I hope it eventually leads to a better foundation for the currency than all the wackiness lately.

How many BTC to become a space cadet?

Sucks the big one, I'm sorry. Seems like the story leads me to believe the guy you were dealing with had his email hacked and was being forwarded to a hacker, who sent you the fake page. Then when you went to check your "wallet" it was all screwy looking because you were still on the fake page, and that was how he got your info. Just trying to learn from this myself. Is this possible?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:58:36
Since what you are doing is against PayPal TOS, they will in no way even consider your case should the buyer decide to chargeback.

In the process (for last 10 days) myself. I would wager that half of the people on facebook bitching about not receiving immediate service are a)clogging up the system for everyone else b)didn't do things properly/read the instructions and c)are taking out support tickets to get their WHEN WHEN WHEN questions answered.
Its like 12,000 people showing up at a mcdonalds that usually serves 500 a day. You're just gonna have to wait and clogging up the support system with tickets just to get your answer as to why you are waiting is not helping the situation.
They are a small operation and overwhelmed right now imo.

technically Coinbase creates a wallet for your account that you can't see, and creates an address that you can send your BTC into.  Same thing just don't want people thinking coinbase is a wallet

5 here. I have heard a week from others
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:37:46
I like your style. Hey if you haven't created a coinbase account yet, then use [this link]( to do so. You and I will get $5 in BTC with your first purchase of 1 BTC. No strings attached, just a referral link that gets you $5 instead of nothing, going the standard route. Cheers

Ya, I opened an account there last week. They can't seem to be able to perform the two small ACH transactions to get my account verified. PayPal was one one day as a comparison.

Well if your friend has an mba, then he didn't learn very much. It is all clearly spelled out in the tax codes now. There is no reason to question it as new and untested. It's a done deal.

I dunno. I was incidentally also trying to link my PayPal account to my credit union account at the very same time as my coinbase account.  The Paypal ach transactions were completed the next day. Coinbase 6 days.

Thanks, if I go that route you will be  on list

Or perhaps the API keys are not encrypted on the client side, making a replay attack possible with only the password
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:59:52
Whether or not you have 2FA on your account at coinbase, if you have the API key enabled then anyone can access your account and perform a transaction solely with your password. 2FA is only effective if you have the API key disabled.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:37:51
Yep. I exported it back to 2009 and there were no transactions prior to today. Is there some way to erase a transaction, or should we call bullshit now.

There are some other comments on this topic saying this is common during rallies and they may have rolling limits that change during the day.  Your account would be deducted after the amount was determined, so Friday

I just had to take a stab. I am "the dad" from OPs post. He brings up an excellent point. We do a heckuvalot of transactions and many are business owners.
I posted about what our generation would likely have problems with (security/tech jargon/security) and seems like the general consensus was pretty much "y'all die off soon enough"
Although this is true, I think it's counterproductive to the general point of promoting the aspect of freedom. I like freedom and liberty, and would like to enjoy a taste of that while still young enough to enjoy it.

I believe the ACH withdrawal is a functioning component for everyone there. I haven't used it yet.
The ACH deposit is being tested now.

I like your style. It is not your modus operandi that causes me to pause at this juncture. It is your price. Thanks, again.

Yes you literally do that, when you file your taxes. Since you somehow funded the account that purchased the original $1000 of BTC and also got some sort of payment in fiat when you sold the $1500 worth, then there IS documentation.
When they sic the agents on you (like they have on me 3 prior times) you will be pretty quickly educated as to exactly what backup documentation the IRS has
Obviously not talking about $500 amounts as being in contention (when they come after somebody), just that they will defer to a voluntary declaration of income or gains in the absence of any iron clad backup documents, like 1099s.

They would need SEC approval as that would fall under securities. Add 6 months

Just to weigh in on the tax issue. Sales tax, as we know it in US, is pretty clearly determined to have the onus to collect and report said tax upon the seller. Not the buyer. There are obvious exceptions such as used cars, where the buyer covers that if not from a dealership.
The tax issues with bitcoin revolve around gains in ordinary income or as a capital gain, when exchanging. Here people could probably use something handy

Only 3 of them to adulthood. Yes, very expensive. Wish I had some more to invest, but no sense crying about the expense.
I gave my son about a third of what it would take him to graduate. I told him to create a TD Ameritrade account and invest it all. Choose wisely son. 
Motherfucker has been getting about 40% return, which i never achieved in a lifetime of small time personal investing. At this point, it looks like he will make it.
He'll pay me back some day when I am old and need a place to stay. I am not too worried about that. I am super proud of him, though. Because he did invest that money and not piss it away partying.  OP should hold and pay his parents back as he sees fit. if they are are raising kids for the purpose of getting their expenses back, then fuck 'em anyways.

haha, I was waiting for that one. Unfortunately my capitalist pig boss still uses the fiat currency of the new order to undercompensate me every week. But the girls at the credit union are super nice.
