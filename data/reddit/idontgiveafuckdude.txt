Thank you that makes me feel so much better about my AAPL long.

They do decrease the money supply by selling treasuries, how do you think they keep inflation in check?

How is it difficult to enforce. They just have exchanges charge more fees and then collect.

Inflation is only bad if you hold your money in cash. The point of inflation and low interest rates is to encourage investment. If you think saving should be done in cash instead of assets you're doing it wrong.

Verification is annoying enough as it is people will likely be truthful. Though you could get around it with a VPN/lying on verification etc it would be very consumer unfriendly. Most of the more exchanges that want to do business with US customers would likely concede to regulation or ban US customers.

This is the entire reason the Federal Reserve is given the independence it has. The Fed has forced inflation down at the cost of short run economic stagnation before (Volcker's recession). 
Again issues currently revolve around not being able to create inflation. In japan the BOJ has purchased about 40% of the government's outstanding bonds, and they've hardly put a dent in inflation.

Very little money is held in foreign reserves, see the US capital account. Most injected reserves remain held by banks lowering total velocity.

This but ironically.


If you're referring to the federal reserve here, then you should know that it is completely subject to the authority of congress, and those who run the board, are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate. 


Except for how it acts rather openly and transparently, by publicizing, and giving rationale for every policy decision it makes. Unlike this post, their decisions are usually grounded in r/goodeconomics.

Most modern economies face the opposite issue injecting a lot of currency with little inflation resulting. You get your Zimbabwes and Weimar Republics generally when the government starts to finance itself with printed money as opposed to debt/taxes. Most governments are pretty good at controlling inflation.

Interest rates are an indicator of how the money market is pricing liquidity. When central banks lower rates what they're doing is increasing the supply of money. If a fiat based system the supply of money can be increased literally infinitely, the lever never ends so to speak.

Because that isn't the primary function of a bank. You can't get a mortgage from bitcoin core. Bitcoin doesn't magically extend businesses the lines of credit they need to function. Even if Bitcoin was the official unit of account there would still be banks
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:04:15
If it were to be the official unit of account then yes banks would use Bitcoin.

The CPI overestimates inflation. Also the BLS reports inflation rates not the Fed, the Fed just uses it to inform their policy decisions. Inflation has been stubborn due to decreases in the velocity of money offsetting increases in the money supply. Inflation has been  lower than the Fed's 2% target for awhile.

What? Whatever currency people use doesn't change the need for loans. 


This statement is completely incoherent. Saving and taking out loans are the complete opposite thing. You take out a loan so that you can spend more now at the cost of spending less in the future. Saving does the complete opposite thing. The demand and need for loans is massive. Companies are able to operate efficiently because they have access to short term credit, and are able to invest because they have access to long term credit. People constantly need loans so that they can afford cars houses, etc banks provide all of these services.
Banks are needed regardless of whatever the currency is. The entire reason they were bailed out during the financial crisis is because a lack of loan availability would have and to a large extend did massively cripple the economy.
Bitcoin is more analogous to and competes more with services like Paypal or Venmo than actual banks.
Also if your using a bank for any long terms savings aside from emergency funds you're doing it wrong and need to take a trip to r/personalfinance.

You do know that inflation tends to drop during recessions right. There's a reason the Fed targets an inflation rate greater than 0.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:01:19
People are encouraged to save. Saving by putting currency under your mattress actively harms the economy. Saving by say buying equities helps grow the economy.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:20:51
As unstable as these systems are, they also produce high growth rates as investment capital is readily available, and savings don't leak.
The hard part is balancing growth with capital adequacy requirements. Honestly systems like Canada's with no reserve requirements and solely capital adequacy requirements are probably better. Canada also has one of the best track records in managing recessions.
Full reserve systems like the Chicago plan are untested so it's hard to say if we'd see the same growth rates.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:03:48
In the long run prices are irrelevant to growth. Growth happens as a result of the development of new technologies that improves factor productivity. That being said deflation is usually harmful in the short run as it's usually a result of falling demand (See Japan).

It's pretty hard to prevent asset bubbles. The fed didn't really have any regulatory power prior to 2008. There's been a lot criticism that they didn't act aggressively enough to sustain 2% inflation and they made a few questionable policy decisions (introducing IOR etc.) They also allowed NGDP to contract which is pretty much never a good idea.

This article is garbage, the size of the Feds balance sheet fluctuates on a weekly basis as there is a lag between when they receive MBS principal and when they reinvest it. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:02:41
The Fees doesn't have the power to regulate banks that's the domain of the government. Most regulatory power they have now ie: stress tests is a result of Dodd-Frank.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:52:04
We have no federal agency dedicated to predicting asset bubbles. It was kind of a perfect storm in the last recession considering the huge amounts of information asymmetry regarding the default risks associated with the MBS (investment banks thought MBS were stable for good reason). Also the rise of the shadow banking sector forced conventional depository banks to compete with their new unregulated counterparts.
The FED is largely a reactive institution they see a problem and counteract it. Blaming them is sort of like blaming your doctor for you getting sick in the first place. It's like saying "Why did the doctor not see my fever coming if his theories are so deep and valid". It's almost impossible to reliably predict recessions. And if you act preemptively you may induce excess inflation. The main criticism of the FED during last recession is that they didn't act aggressively enough to keep up consistent NGDP growth. They were given oversight power in Dodd-Frank and now stress test banks in order to see that they maintain capital adequacy. The conventional banking sector is far more stable now at the very least, though shadow banking is still a worry.

Hard to say full reserve models are completely untested. Saving in a full reserve system would have to be done almost entirely through equity and bond markets, or through time deposits. What would likely happen is that the government would lend banks money which banks would loan out at higher interest rates. This effectively gets rid of endogenous money, and lets the government have complete control over the money supply.
A large issue is that this would likely not prevent economic collapses. Commercial banks wouldn't fail, but the economy would still be vulnerable to recession, commercial banks are only a small portion of lenders. Non-Depository banks and Shadow banks would still be lending, they just don't have deposits as liabilities. In the last recession the only reason commercial banks were failing is that they bought securitized assets made by shadow banks.


Not really. No matter what the interest rate is if the borrower defaults the bank loses tons of money.


Bitcoin's value is based on its ability to buy drugs, and speculation. It has huge scaling problems, which makes it inefficient as a payment platform. Other crypto-currencies may have specific uses, and blockchain technology as a whole has loads of uses, but Bitcoin would make a shitty currency. 


No it wont. There's literally no reason to think this.


Bitcoin will always have value as long as there's speculators, and as long as you can buy drugs with it. If governments try in earnest to shut it down, the speculators are gone. If the darknet sites get shut down, then it loses almost all of it's transaction demand.
