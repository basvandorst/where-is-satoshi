I'm running full node on RP3 but it uses BerkeleyDB which is incompatible with Windows or Mac version. New version Bitcoin Core uses LevelDB and when you transfer the blockchain to PC or Mac, Bitcoin starts reindexing block from the scratch which takes nearly 2 days on my 2.3ghz i7 MBP.

Raspberry Pi placed near your router won't be enough?

You don't need to wait for confirmation when you make a payment from a mobile wallet because it's not possible to create same transaction. Also don't worry about a double spend while the payer is drunk :)

I have tried the BIP39 converter but it didn't work. Because I'm using an HD wallet which means I have multiple users for one wallet and BTC address' starts with 3 instead 1 Mycellium wallet creates a different wallet. I guess I got stucked.

Until I saw the Paypal logo, I thought it's Bitcoin!

There are too much speculations on Bitcoin. Every single day there is at least one news about it's dead and a couple hours later we hear it's not dead. Price is always going down - down - down - UP - down - UP - down - down - down - UP - down etc... On one hand there are companies investing on Bitcoin, startups growing but on the other hand, there are developers leaving Bitcoin. One day we learn a new x-coin is popuplar and all newbies trying to mine the new altcoin to get some profit. Other day, people are talking that the hashrate increase significantly and there are no profit with their hardware. There is a fact that "profit" is not something for newbies. There will always be someone who have hardware for Bitcoin...

I know that everybody said the same but I can't stop asking it to myself: How could you left 95BTC on a computer with Electrum open? It's same as leaving £350k on a desk next to the window.

The situation is not that bad. There are mor than 40 exchanges in Turkey. Most of them don't have enough volume but it's easy to launch and exchange. The difficult part is having bank accouınts. Most banks refuse to work with exchanges because there is no regulation. But, luckily it's going on in someway and we are able to trade Bitcoin in Turkey ...
