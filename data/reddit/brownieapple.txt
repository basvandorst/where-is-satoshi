I’m just another small dip away from being at the real amount of money I put in. Bought at 8k and change sold at 16 re bought at barely even lower but still got more coin. Then made two more. One at 19.4k(-_-) and the other moving some ripple after it hit $1 back into BTC. 
Hodling. I’m not going anywhere and too bad I don’t have the funds right this second but buy at this dip. :(

I’m someone who has followed for a while, but was not in a place financially to jump in until now. So, I finally decided to get my feet wet(~40$ worth) last week when it was at ~7600$. Do you feel that now is still a good time for us to jump in even with very small(50$-500$) weekly/monthly investments?
I plan on getting in anyway this way. At worst I make a couple extra dollars or lose it all. I’m one of the 50/50 mindset guys that are into bitcoin.  Of course I would like to make some money no matter how small but I also am into some of the ideas behind bitcoin. 
I will tell you it was a rush buying my first little bit of a coin.

Hmm okay. I shouldn’t have any that I know of. I just recently(last Thursday/Friday) bought some BTC. Though I will be looking into how to claim forked coin for the future. And looking into hardware wallets. Are there any good ones  that aren’t expensive(I’d rather put more into BTC) or is it “the price to play” type thing. Don’t get me wrong I’m willing to spend to keep mine safe and I know a tiny bit about paper wallets.

I’ll take your word on that since it’s your profession lol. Thanks for the tidbit of info for a noob too. I’ll look into hardware wallets over the next week or so.

I’m new to this. How does one claim those forked currencies? And say I own .25 BTC; do I get the xyzCoin equivalents? Do I have to own x number of BTC before the fork?
