It was the usual tweet under a tweet that convinced you to act quick. Transfer between a certain amount of coin and then you’ll get at least treble back, and then loads of people posting screenshots back of the transactions and also some links showing the verified transactions to all make it seem legit. So I panicked jumped on board and that was that. 
It was only after the transaction completed I realized something was fishy that I checked everything out and knew I fucked up.

How log what took? Until the scammers realized I was messing with them? There was 1 guy looking for Western Union money transfers in Nigeria, he claimed he lived hits from his local Western Union so I made up some fake transfer slips and kept sending him to go pick up the money that obviously was never there. He kept coming back trying to get me to send him money for 3 weeks. Everyone else was usually 2-4days. Longest phone conversation was 50ish minutes. But they usually terminate around 10minutes. I since went to college and got a job so I haven’t had time to string scammers along for the last few years, but I used to get a kick out of it.

I got stung by an Elon Musk scam on twitter, quickly realized it but it was too late and I lost ~$400. I contacted Coinbase and they said there’s nothing they can do. So hopefully karma gets whoever got my money. 
As someone who used to string email and phone scammers along to waste their time I’m embarrassed I got caught by this one, but it was a tough time financially and I had my hopes raised and then instantly crushed to only compound the financial troubles at the time.

If that’s what it was spent on then I can live with that.
