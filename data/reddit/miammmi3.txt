bunch of options for hardcore places like china: stealth, stealth proxy, stunnel so I do not think FW can stop them . 
but there is nothing like trying it in the wild and seeing for yourself

maybe you already have a channel opened with someone and then you dont need to open one .  
lets say you connect to torguard, and they have a channel to person X, so you can pay your bud without opening a channel to him

people think that 1 satoshi is cost of the transaction itself while they in reality sell their VPN for that price instead of the regular price, and there is no cost of transaction aside from opening a channel

Get the one that accepts lightning payments

Good info
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:14:36
VPN is usually priced at 10$/month  
They are giving it away "for free" when you instead of 10$ pay 1 sat  for 1 month   
+ you have opening channel fees on top of that, but that is the cost of service they are selling it now, not fees or anything, as tx fees are 0

@_date: 2017-08-28 10:09:54
discussion was good and respectful.

bitstamp is solid . 
this is how you do it:   
but be aware that if you deposit btc to them, they can halt your withdrawal asking Qs like Where did you get those btc and can we see miner equipment receipts if you tell them you mined it!? thats whats been said about them online, google it . 
Kraken seems solid, but price there is almost always higher . 
bitstamp now 3898$
kraken 3939$

already available on ledger

go samourai! NO 2X
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:02:58


yes, i think so to. same as how it worked with shit coin split
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:12:42
ok cool.  
as long as you are not paying 10% . 
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:05:05
and there is no real use of you sending btc to new segwit address, just for them to sit on the segwit address, as you will need to pay the fees.    
what you can do is to start receiving new payments to your new segwit address, and non segwit BTC you will spend when you need to thus, paying transactions only once
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:19:40
we support you 100%
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:25:20
u are confusing Bitcoin with jihan's shitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:15:36
plus is when you receive to new segwit address, is that you can send someone 10$ without fees being 3$.   
and in the future we got atomic swaps, LN..all that is in the works and is coming to a BTC near you .  
so if you are receiving btc, make sure its to new segwit address .  
i agree, its hard to navigate, we gonna have to hire like crypto manager to just note all the shit down so you know where you have what...

guys, to report back. 
I was at Eat me, two times. 
talked with the owner.  
the place is super posh. for taking date out and sh$t.  
food is really nice. passion fruit cocktail is what you need to order.  
they have single QR printed for payments, and you calculate your self how much you will send. instead of them showing  each client specific QR.  
I have them free biz advise and stuff how they can lift that to a pro level.  
visit them.

passion fruit cocktail

@_date: 2016-12-29 16:30:36
i would love for the Airbnb to start accepting BTC.  
that would push BTC over 1k 100%
@_date: 2016-12-12 08:00:20

Email them at reservations and they can check availability for you
@_date: 2016-09-09 09:59:53

@_date: 2016-09-09 09:57:16

@_date: 2017-05-03 05:58:32
