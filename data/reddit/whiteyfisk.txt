I've heard that the Bitcoin pizza was bought by the guy that invented gpu-mining.
So, although the press story is that he's in despair now for all the wealth he traded for a pizza, in reality he played a small role in sparking the birth of "real-world value" for bitcoin, which increased the value of the tens of thousands of bitcoins that he didn't sell for pizza :)

If your whole goal is totally avoid fees, then fiat is best, and you won't pay any at all. Totally agree. 
That's not the point I was arguing against though. 
The point I hear repeatedly, and that I was arguing against is:
**No one is going to spend BTC because it might be worth 10x the amount down the road.** 
That is the complaint that "spend n replace" resolves: eliminating the fear that people have of spending BTC because it might be worth exponentially more some day. 
Your point is addressing a different complaint:
**Why would anyone pay in Bitcoin if they can pay in fiat and totally avoid any fees?**
That's a great question, and a whole new discussion. There are a lot of reasons to pay with Bitcoin, and a lot of reasons to not pay with Bitcoin, but if you start a new thread on the topic I'd be very happy to join the discussion and hear what people have to say.

Ok, I'm back with some ideas and feedback :)
Again, I think the idea is brilliant, so these are just some ideas  to help optimize it, mostly aimed at increasing the payment rate, and helping you accurately distinguish the size of the different "nonpayment groups." 
1. I think the way that it is currently set up, you aren't just testing honesty, but also people's followup skills. You are going to lose some sales due to disorganization and procrastination, despite people's honest intentions. So, I would add a lot of support to help the people with good intentions but poor followup skills. Allow them to volunteer their email if they are worried they might forget to pay, and would like to receive reminders. Encourage them to contact you directly if they would like to pay but can't figure out Bitcoin. Basically, there are steps you can take to ensure that everyone with the INTENTION of paying actually pays you, but without those steps, your payment rate will be less, and you won't know which of those non-payments are from not liking the book, which are from poverty, and which are from procrastination and forgetfulness. 
2. Rather than totally "forgiving payment" for people that don't know where there money is coming from, I think it's better for tracking purposes, and their own dignity, to tell them to send what they can, even if it is just a nickel. That is one of the beauties of Bitcoin, that a homeless person could download your book on his phone (most of them have phones now), and send you a small amount to say, "I enjoyed the book, and here is what I can afford." A quarter from a very poor person is a much bigger token of gratitude than $2 from a middle class person. 
3. In terms of improving the tracking of an honor system, and including participation of all economic classes, down to people with nothing, it seems like the simplest solution is to have a commitment statement where people fill in their name, and then click "Download Book." 
The statement would be like 
"I, [fill in name, or handle for yourself, if you'd like to remain anonymous] acknowledge that by downloading this book, I commit to eventually return to this website, to either a) pay an amount of Bitcoin that fairly represents the amount of enjoyment I got from reading the book, based on what I can afford, or b) if I don't finish the book or don't enjoy it, provide feedback letting the author know that the story wasn't my cup of tea."
And also have something like, leaving your email address is totally optional, but if you are afraid that you might -- despite your best intentions -- forget to fulfill this commitment, you may leave your email here so that we can send you reminders. 
Then, when they click submit, your website can compile a list of their names/nicknames, and you'll be able to track exactly how many of them fulfill that commitment. You'll also get more money than $2 from people who really enjoy the book, more feedback on the book in general, and it allows people who can't afford $2 to still send a token of gratitude.
Also, the various amounts of money that people submit provides a cool way to track how much of an impact your books have on people. Maybe one book gets much higher or lower payments than another, or maybe women or men tend to pay much higher, etc. 
Hope that all makes sense!

Thanks for your comment!
I think software will easily track the value of your bitcoin, and track the loss or gain associated with each purchase, so it's basically a non issue. 
Gold currently is deflationary, most of the time.
If something happened that made the amount if gold increase, that would be inflationary, and the value of gold would actually go down.

Thanks for your comments! This is helping me understand the debate. 
1: My original point was regarding:


2: You replied saying that point was only used when people are saying that Bitcoin will become the primary currency in the world. 


3: I responded with an article by someone who was *not* arguing against the point Bitcoin will become the "primary currency in the world, and was making the much bolder claim that **"Bitcoin Will Never Be a Currency"** and that people won't ever want to "spend Bitcoins" except to buy things on Black Markets.)
4: You responded by updating your point to say the context of that article was someone arguing against the claim that Bitcoin would replace the dollar. 




5: The author of that article not talking about Bitcoin usurping the dollar -- he doesn't state that anywhere -- but only Bitcoin becoming a "currency." (Referring to Bitcoin as "dollar 2.0" is just saying it could be an improved version of currency, not saying it could totally replace the dollar.) 
6: Thank you. Your points have been very helpful food for thought in refining the specifics of my point:
**We should obliterate the myth that people will never want to spend Bitcoin from fear of deflation, regardless of the argument that people are citing that fact to support.**
My post title was focused on people arguing that "Bitcoin can't succeed" but now I see I should have focused on the specific sub-point, not the larger arguments that people use that sub-point to support. 
Regardless of the context, the "fear of spending" problem has an easy solution, and so is not a true obstacle to the success of Bitcoin on any scale. 
7: Your points also helped me realize that anyone that actually *is* arguing against Bitcoin replacing the USD, or becoming the de facto world currency, is probably arguing against a straw man. The primary debate now is simply whether Bitcoin can survive, and then, whether it succeed, and possibly thrive as a useful medium exchange for decades to come. 
I see Bitcoin as in the "minor leagues," and the critical debate is whether it can make it to the "majors." Replacing the USD would be "winning the World Series," but that's a long way off, so I don't really see many people arguing for, or against, that scenario. 
Thanks for taking the time to respond. I'll update my post with insights from your points.

I misread your post the first time.
Yes, for people who got rich on Bitcoin and have nearly all their assets in it, you are right it won't work for them, if they are spending a lot of it. 
But for the general population, that had more fiat than BTC, it will work fine. 
Thanks for your point though, it is true.

I don't know how to build back ends, but in the meantime, people can make them by plugging their data into the following URL:
I modified your original to remove the form field descriptions so they wouldn't appear behind the keys, and I added a super subtle "CoinCult" signature on it that's almost invisible, but so if you ever see one out in the world it will allow you to easily demonstrate that  you're the one who designed it :)

Thanks for commenting. 
I'd agree that fiat has many large and important roles that Bitcoin -- in its current state -- can't do. 
But, as time goes on, more and more of those things will become possible. 
Bitcoin makes money "programmable" which severely limits the number of functions that will always be *totally impossible* for Bitcoin to achieve. Programmable things can always do more things than non-programmable things. 
Mostly, the Venn diagram was talking about *potential* functions, i.e., what functions could Bitcoin *eventually* perform, compared to what functions it will *never* be able to perform. 
*By 2024, I expect that for every 10 functions that fiat can perform, there will be 1 functions that Bitcoin still can't do, and there will be another 100 functions that Bitcoin can do that fiat can't do.*
Personally, I'm not arguing that Bitcoin is better than fiat, or will replace it. **I think of fiat and Bitcoin like a partnership between George Washington and Superman; I'm happy to see them collaborate and co-exist.** Just because Superman can do tons of stuff that George Washington can't do doesn't mean that we don't need George. You don't even realize how important George's special skills are until you see which ones even Superman can't do. 
I'd definitely read that comic book... Marvel heroes go back in time to help the founding fathers fight evil :)

To be more specific:
Bitcoin allows an ordinary person to send $1000 directly to someone in another country, in less than 30 minutes, without the need for any intermediary party.
Has anything like that ever existed before?
The jump from being able to send "digital info" to being able to send "digital real-world value" is the critical jump into totally new territory. 
If you could spend video game currency at hundreds of online stores around the world, or pay your employees with it, I wouldn't be as dramatic about about how much of an innovation Bitcoin is. But you can't, so Bitcoin is a pretty big deal. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:53:42
That was a fun post to read!
I used to get angry at the trolls, but then I realized they are a good omen:
If there wasn't any irrational hatred of Bitcoin, the price would be at $3000 a coin right now. 
So, every time you see a troll on Reddit or TV, remember that person is -- in the long run -- helping you make money by keeping the coin price down by perpetuating unfounded rumors, and allowing you to buy more cheap coins before everyone realizes that Bitcoin actually isn't such a stupid idea after all. 
The anger toward them wasn't doing me any good anyway... what fun is being right if you're more miserable than the people who are wrong?

As time goes on more merchants will offer a discount for BTC purchases since they can avoid the credit card fees, and exchange fees will drop as more competition enters the market.
Coinbase can only charge one percent while they are the only game in town.
So, long term, that's not an issue.

Thanks for pointing that out! Didn't realize that. 
I have to question the decision of the editors at the Atlantic to put "1 paragraph" in the headline, and then split it into two paragraphs. 
Nevermind the fact that it's a poor argument, resting on a problem which is easily solved by software. 
If I can buy a pizza with bitcoin, or a computer, or a movie ticket, then it works perfectly fine as a commercial medium of exchange. And if I can save 2% on some of those things, than it works even better than the USD in my opinion. 
He says "if I have to figure out" ... but **he** doesn't have to figure it out. His software can figure it out. It's a problem that has already been solved with stocks. Warren Buffet doesn't sit down with a calculator and "figure out" his FIFO for every stock he's sold when he does his taxes.

FYI, you were quoted here...
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:49:06
It also mentioned that it takes a few years to respond to a rule change like that, and that when they made a similar rule change in Australia, eventually "entire industries" began trying it out. 


I'd agree that it may never happen, but it's possible that a culture shift takes place over the next few years, based on the rule change and the fact that with Bitcoin, retailers can accept payments from customers without cash, which is the one of the big problems that credit cards solve. 
When stores realize they can accept payments from people's cell phones, AND not pay any credit card fees, AND not have any risk of chargebacks, there is quite a bit of incentive for them to accept Bitcoin and give people a small discount for using it. 
Hitting the hay... Happy arguing!
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:43:23
Very interesting analysis! I agree.
It led leads to another insight about why the growth of Bitcoin *and* bitcoin value has been exponential: there's a strong positive feedback loop that is inherent in the situation you've described. 
1. The incentive for significant Bitcoin network development is dependent on real world value of the bitcoins.  
2. As the Bitcoin network grows, the real world value of bitcoins increase. 
3. As the real world value of bitcoins increases, the incentive for Network growth increases. 
4. As Network growth increases, the real world value of bitcoins increases... 
In the absence of any negative feedback loops strong enough to counteract this very forceful positive one, the chain reaction is bound to continue, with Bitcoin and bitcoin value growing until the process runs up against the absolute limits imposed by the earth's economy. (Of course, a fatal protocol flaw could kill the whole thing, though.)
The hardest part is the beginning: Why should Bitcoin/bitcoin take off in the beginning, when it has no value, and there is no real world incentive?
Initially, it is totally depending on inherent 'activity value': people supporting the network because it is fun. 
Somehow, that 'hobbyist power' was enough of a spark to get it to the point where it could accrue real world value, and the rest is history.
Right now its like a wildfire that has already passed its tipping point.
Before it existed, you could have easily argued that it would be impossible to really ever "get it stared." But, now that is *has* started, it seems naive to think it will just "die out" on its own, barring a complete internal failure.
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:36:14
You are totally correct that this will not work for someone who spends $100,000 in BTC on a car when they have less than $100,000 of fiat in the bank.

@_date: 2014-03-27 15:17:02
Thanks for this thoughtful comment.
My initial reaction is that even bitcoin is unique, because it is the first completely digital unit of exchange. 
It can act like many existing currencies, but nevertheless, even lowercase b bitcoin is still quite unique from them with regard to its digitalness.
I need to read your response more carefully before I give a full response though.

It's funny, because I made up a new digital coin based on a ledger, and when I was telling people at about it, they were like, "So, it's just a ledger of who owns what, but they're not real like Dogecoins are real?" 
I guess in the beginning of any currency, people think it's made up and can't see why it's real, and then when everyone accepts it, people think it's totally real and can't remember why it's made up. 
And the people who see that brand new currencies are real, in their own way, and remind everyone that old currencies are really just IOUs, are seen as the eccentric ones...

Right, it would be good if there was an "off" switch for the feature :)


It is just a reality that there is a chance it could be worth 10x at some point down the road, so I don't think it reflects a lack of faith in its value as a currency to be aware of that fact, and to replace the Bitcoins you spend and keep a constant balance, instead of letting the balance dwindle over time. 


Yes, that's a good idea! If there was an easy way to do that, it would be great. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:07:30
I totally agree with you here. 
Note that you've got your B's mixed up though... the currency is lowercase, and the protocol/network/software is uppercase. 
That fits with your point though, that the Network aspect is more radically innovative than the currency aspect.

In "spend n replace" you are buying the BTC at the exact moment you are selling them, so there is no price differential. You buy a pizza for X BTC, and you buy X amount of BTC to replenish your account.

First off, I think it's very good of you to defend his right to privacy and to call out hypocrisy when you see it, and benefits from people like you. 
The first key point has already been well made by others here ( has over 100,000 readers, so the "we" is pretty fuzzy, and conflicting opinions will often get popular support on both sides, without it being hypocrisy).
Beyond that, I judge people's actions by their intentions, and the emotion behind their intentions. I think Leah Goodman's intentions were to accrue fame and attention, and her emotional state was one of greed, and apathy for any harm done to the man who's doxxing could serve as a stepping stone for her career. 
I think the creation and enjoyment of the Dorian wallet was honestly done out of affection for the man, and that if there was any indication it would harm the man, there would be almost no one here that would support it. 
Fact is, the guy is totally endearing in the way he has handled the situation, so people like him, and like to think and talk about him. 
Another way to look at this story is: here is a man who was down on his luck and having a hard time, and now he is beloved to a small community of passionate Bitcoin fans, not because he invented Bitcoin, but because of how he carried himself as a person during the shitstorm that followed the Newsweak article.
This affection will benefit his life, in the long run, and I'm almost certain of that. Long after the fiat crowd has forgotten about Dorian, the Bitcoin community will be there for him, if he ever needs anything (and your spirited defense of his privacy is great proof of that). 
When you think about it that way, it's a pretty beautiful ending to a story that started out with so much greed and selfishness. 
The Bitcoin Community (the real "BitCom") should pat itself on the back.

I love this idea, and high concept experiments in human kindness and honor. 
I'm also exploring the idea of the "honor system" in the world of digital currency, through an experimental digital coin called DoubleCoin. Only 50 exist, and currently people have the opportunity to get one of the coins simply by performing an act of kindness, documenting it, and then sending any amount of Bitcoin they see fit (even if only a penny).
I'm typing this on my phone, but I have a couple ideas to help your experiment succeed, which I'll write later!

I was hesitant to put in the /u/ or the Reddit URL, because I didn't know if CoinCult actually wanted people to be able to find him. He chooses not to sign the images, out of humility &amp; respect for the clean look of the designs (I assume), so I just wanted to add a tiny easter egg to give him credit, but without changing the appearance visually or making him easily findable.
That was my thinking at least.

That is because credit card companies had policies in place that made it illegal for stores to charge less for cash purchases, but that rule just changed in 2013:


Yes, I was. Thanks for the correction! 
Still, I'm only addressing one specific complaint about Bitcoin, which is that **people are afraid to spend their Bitcoin because it might be worth 100x more someday.** "Spend n replace" resolves that one specific complaint, so people should stop saying it. 
Regarding whether there are advantages to using Bitcoin in general is a much bigger question, which I wasn't getting into.

It's funny how the success of Bitcoin can sound *totally implausible* when you first hear it, and yet the more you think about it, the more it starts to seem *inevitable.*
I guess that's why the debate is so polarized!

I had the same thought about a week ago :)

Thanks. Yes, context of an argument is everything. 
The context where I've seen it is people saying that Bitcoin can never gain *any* significant acceptance as a currency, and that it will eventually *fail* because no one will ever want to spend it. 
I've never actually seen anyone argue that Bitcoin will become the primary currency of the world, so I haven't heard anyone use the point in that context.  
Thanks for your comment

Yeah, true, it definitely needs to be simple and clear, without too much text. Totally agree. 
Some other ideas...
- you could have a 60 second video explaining it. that reduces the need for text, allows people to form an emotional connection with the author, and the video itself might get some additional attention for the project
- you could post the experimental results of the project in real time, which would motivate people to pay for their book quickly, to help improve those statistics (especially if payment rate was low) 
- To simplify the up front page, but still have better tracking, you could try this: AFTER they click to download the book, and it's downloading, the website could take them to a page explaining your tracking process, where they can volunteer to submit an email address or a nickname, if they'd like to. 
- Your QR code &amp; Bitcoin code should be there on the page, in case some diligent kind souls want to pay right away

Okay, just logged into Blockchain so I can see that they both came through. Thanks so much!
I'll put the first one in my beer fund, and the second one I'll "pay forward" to the next awesome post I see, to keep the good karma train rolling!

is there an exciting new technology that you have positive feelings about?
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:28:14
Thanks! Always nice to get positive feedback on a comment I probably spent too much time working on.

Did they say that in this report?
Or somewhere else...

Oh, got it. I forgot it had to be enabled... thought it was always on.

Great data. Thanks! 
How do you pull those numbers?

The deposit is held in dollars, not tether, and then you can buy BTC, LTC, or ETH with it.

What is the market maker checkbox?

Look into using Coinbase's exchange, GDAX! You automatically have an account if you have a coinbase account.
The prices are lower, and if you place a "market maker" bid then you pay zero fees :)
