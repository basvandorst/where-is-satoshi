The gotcha is, of course, that you need Level 2 verification in order to use debit cards. They specifically ask for a scan of your passport (which I don't have at the moment) instead of a more general government-issued ID, and an utility bill.

Reminds me how LocalBitcoins implemented SegWit not too long ago, but they still have the outrageous deposit and withdrawal fees. So they're effectively pocketing the savings instead of passing them down to users.
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:41:32
While we're at it: Bitfinex is also still pocketing outrageous fees when depositing "small amounts" and withdrawing any amount. Except for, oh, you know, Bitcoin Cash, in which the fees are pennies on Bitcoin's dollars.

I've been following a similar guide to this, however the one thing I'm not sure is if it'd be fine to use a remote bitcoind node.
My home net connection is incredibly awful and downloading the entire blockchain would take longer than the heat death of the Universe, so I got one deployed in a Digital Ocean droplet. The thing I'm particularly unsure about is the ZeroMQ requirement, that is, if it'd be just fine to replace all IP addresses with the one from my node after setting up the ports accordingly.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:59:05
Sure, whatever. I was trying to imply Bitfinex was clearly playing favorites.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:20:38
Only thing that concerns me is the mainnet deployment of Lightning has been far too lackadaisical. I understand growth ought to be "organic" but some big public announcement along with tutorials and mainnet public nodes to connect to would make things far better for everyone. Hell, make it for Litecoin first if it's a must, as the much lower (comparatively speaking) fees will reduce the friction a lot when opening and closing channels while still allowing people to mess around with it with real money.

You can use it along with Spaces, it will be considerably slower, but also much cheaper. I've got a node going on mounting my Spaces "bucket" with s3ql so I'm only paying $10 a month or so.

The Ledger Nano S certainly can store more than just Bitcoin (To wit: BTC/BCH/BTG/ETH/ETC and I think there's XMR support coming up from a third party). The Trezor might have similar capabilities too, not really sure.

Nothing through Gox, but a really unstable market as a consequence, which will probably take months to stabilize once again. I'm not talking about raw value here (Though of course, I enjoyed things more when BTC was at $1200 each) but I worry about Bitcoin's image for the rest of the world.

I know what it takes to make a product such as the TREZOR and its associated services, and I know the sort of trust it implies. **Yet its price point is still prohibitive for many people, R&amp;D included or not.** I wouldn't buy the BWallet either, simply because I wouldn't like to support exploitative practices and blatantly ripping off an existing product instead of improving and building upon it in the true spirit of Open Source. Not to mention all the security concerns you mentioned...
The fact remains that the TREZOR (hardware without any extra services, firmware and R&amp;D being a sunk cost) *could* cost $19 and sold for a bit more for a profit, but it doesn't and that's alright if you and your clients perceive is its value. The very first personal computers were also prohibitively expensive for a vast majority of people after all, so were the first cellphones. Hell, that's usually the case for any consumer-oriented product in a new market, even if the technology exists. Hopefully this will prompt some more serious competition and maybe someday, there will be a truly viable entry-level, secure hardware wallet solution for those who want to get into Bitcoin. Your product isn't that solution.
As for me, I'm a wee bit hopeful over a few other projects coming up soon. But we'll see~
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:25:30
Way to completely screw what is otherwise a decent, albeit overpriced product. I said before that the TREZOR isn't yet the mass-adoption hardware wallet device Bitcoin needs, but changing licensing terms like that will precisely hurt their business among the enthusiasts that once supported them. In other words, SL (and by extension) just pissed off the kind of people who are the most vocal about (F)OSS and the least likely to forgive.

Bitfinex has terrible rates for Bitcoin, so I've been mostly using Poloniex for margin funding instead. If you've got USD to spare or are willing to risk a sudden and dramatic change in the exchange rate and you're up to go through the asinine AML/KYC verification process, then this may be a better deal.
How are you doing withdrawals? Simply exchanging back to BTC? Do you need to have been verified in order to do this?

There are only just two sites I've trusted so far when it comes to Bitcoin casino investment, and both are no longer worth the possible risk: JustDice and Pocket Rockets Casino. The first has a really good track but I'm unwilling to "double-dip" on my risk by turning the BTC I want to invest into another cryptocurrency and then hope for the value to hold up. And PRC's owner strikes me as a generally unlikable person, even if he's been doing a good job with the site so far.

Okay, I will bite.
I did go through his Twitter and the implications are still unnerving. Daniel calls himself a voluntaryist; an anarcho-capitalist by another name. His plan to fend off BU's attack against the blockchain, or any future attack, is to deploy SPV clients (so not full nodes) to every Windows user through an update. Now, he doesn't actually *say* this, but what other way could he do it in a fast and meaningful enough way? Whether or not he actually has the power to do it, there's nothing about voluntary labor in his idea. He likens it to "browsers rejecting sites w/ unsafe certs" to better defend his point.
Good for the blockchain in the short and mid-term? Yes, perhaps. However, for whatever reason Microsoft likes Bitcoin, so it'd still be a golden chance to expose millions to it, and the premise of one centralized entity wishing to control the fate of one technology is what got us in this mess to begin with.
@_date: 2016-01-09 16:43:43
Alright, just to clarify: if you exchange BTC for USD in Bitfinex, you can lend USD and then convert back to BTC if you want to withdraw and all of this without touching verification, correct?

Not much confidence in the OTC groups I frequent- all the offers I've seen are to sell, not so much to buy. The existing exchanges that aren't obvious government honeypots also deal with Bitcoin only. So I've got the same issue as with any other altcoin: I've got it, but people aren't trading with it.
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:50:54
I realize it's a bit of a chicken-and-egg issue, but the main reason why I don't use DEX is precisely because there aren't any people using them, especially for less popular fiat currencies (I've posted offers for Bolivares in Bisq that have gone unanswered for months, until I just got fed up and cancelled them) and that's without even considering any trust issues.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:44:56
This will only keep happening until the current Bcash bagholders (Aka the miners) dump their part, goaded by the massive downwards pressure. With every oscillation, the spikes will start to get shallower and the valleys will get deeper and Bcash's value will tend towards zero. It's an attack, yes, but not a particularly effective one.
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:48:51
If you're going to risk your BTC in lending, you might as well go for something like Bitfinex or Poloniex. Even after Bitfinex got hacked and everybody with a BTC balance got a 36% haircut, they show signs of recovery and are still very much operating.

@_date: 2017-08-30 23:36:37
Interesting. I gave it a cursory look and even though the promise of fee-less, blockchain-less transactions is an alluring one, is it essentially a 100% pre-mined cryptocurrency? They mention there's no mining either.
I mean, I'm still going to have the same issues with people not knowing what the hell it is, but at least that's one interesting aspect of it.

I suspect the adoption rates will increase dramatically once more popular wallets support SegWit. It's coming "soon" for Electrum at the very least, which I'd believe is one of the most used wallets out there.

Yeah, it's monthly minimum wage, gonna clarify that.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:47:36
Venezuelan here. High fees can be really prohibitive when dealing with Bitcoin, and thus I've had to either transact with uncomfortable amounts of money at a time (Why should have millions worth of a currency so unstable, Bitcoin looks like a bastion of stability next to it? Besides, Bitcoin might go way up or down in a matter of hours... the Bolivar only ever goes down) or wait out for calm periods with relatively low fees in order to exchange to VEF to pay for utilities, food and medicines (Brought illegally through the Colombian border at a considerable markup, if I may add).
To put things under perspective: our minimum monthly wage at the moment is 97.531 Bolivares. Under the black market rate, that's 5.55 USD or 0.00120029 BTC at current prices (~4623 USD per BTC), amounts that aren't unheard of to pay as fees during high traffic periods. I just can't wait for Lightning, *anything* to alleviate these fees, especially when dealing with things that would be considered microtransactions in the so-called civilized world.
Of course, you could just tell me, "why don't you deal with Litecoin/Dogecoin/what have you?" and yeah, it's true, my fees would be much, much lower. But people barely know of Bitcoin as it is at the moment, dealing with altcoins is just far too cumbersome and lossy.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:15:00
Getting the BTC to LocalBitcoins can be expensive to begin with, even more so when they've been so greedy as to pass down their operative expenses to users directly (even though they already take a hefty commission per transaction) and include a "deposit fee", so you're effectively paying transaction fees twice. Here's how said fees are looking like at the moment: 
Mind you, that's per deposit. BTC.com tells me the best transaction fees are around 40 Satoshis/byte at the moment, so there's definitively some funky business going on.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:43:38
For the average Venezuelan? Not quite, our priorities are somewhere else. Namely surviving the everyday grind and finding *anything* to eat. Crypto is still of course of use for the diminishing middle class with just enough money to be worth the trouble to convert to Bitcoin, or anyone receiving remittances since our government also wants to stick their grubby paws into those.
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:50:24
I'm not exactly a fan of Poloniex as I did have my account locked up for a couple of months as they verified my personal info (I had what they called a "legacy" account) but in the end I was able to get my money (\~$100 in Monero) just fine. My guess is support got testy when you said you were going to close your account and all the more suspicious when you refused to give more information.

The cat is out of the bag already with cryptocurrencies. Even if Bitcoin in its current incarnation doesn't survive to the next decade or the next century, amid mocking screams of "I told you it was just a bubble!" it'll have a good run, and it'll inspire generations to come. Of course the old money is going to be up in arms against it.
In the end, there's nothing truly safe to invest on. Stocks, bonds... all that value might just disappear in a blink of an eye with the right scandal or if one important dude doesn't like another important dude's attitude and starts a war over it. Gold? Same deal. Might as well just have fun with something they haven't gotten their grubby mitts on completely yet.

Just imagine my surprise when I found out I still had some Bitcoin C(r)ash left to redeem in some old wallets. Sold when they were going up to $2.5k each (Hey, could have gone higher, but didn't want to risk being one of them empty bagholders) and bought BTC when it slumped down to $5800. Feels good man.

For me, Bitcoin has been literally a lifesaver because no matter how unstable it might be, it is still a far better store of value than my own currency has ever been. Don't have an USD bank account overseas (Those are just reserved for the "enchufados," you know), having high amounts of foreign currency in cash is pretty dangerous and I can't really trust PayPal with high amounts of money, lest they have a flight of fancy and decide to freeze my account, leaving me with nothing. Bitcoin is the only thing I got left.
@_date: 2016-02-07 23:00:54
I've paid for things directly in BTC before to people who are already involved in it. Otherwise, I just make use of LocalBitcoins to sell my BTC as I'm needing VEF. Only relatively small amounts at a time, since otherwise inflation will make any large amounts worth less pretty quickly.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:31:27
I'm sure this was originally the trend, but as it stands right now, the poor are the most affected by the general scarcity we're suffering from, which is all a consequence of what Chavez started and Maduro continued. No populist policy can amend that. We simply didn't suffer from it earlier because we rode on the high oil prices while we neglected our own infrastructure, and now that the bubble has burst, we've realized we just sold our asses to the Chinese.

Only after they were publicly called out on it and the shitflinging got too much for Bitmain to ignore. The "bug" itself is not new, it just probably came into relevance now when people were looking for ammo against Jihan Wu.

Yes I have. Slowly working on getting out of here before shit really hits the fan, but considering I'm still in college (Paying for most of my expenses with BTC I saved up during the "literally everyone with a GPU can mine" phase, at that) I'm probably in for a bumpy ride. I do have family in Canada, but I'd like to be as self-reliant as possible.
@_date: 2018-11-09 18:56:37
Government officials have caught on Bitcoin use here in Venezuela and have started to make uncomfortable questions if they think you may be geeky enough to use it, though of course it'd be a bit harder for them to confiscate them from you than if they catch you carrying gold or undeclared USD bills. The key is plausible deniability: if they catch you with a Ledger and force you to hand over the PIN for it, you just give them an alternate PIN and keep the bulk of your BTC in your main account.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:38:45
I just want this whole Tether kerfuffle to blow up already. Not because I enjoy watching people lose money and my own holdings drop sharply in value, but just so people like Bitfinex'ed are no longer needed and disappear already.

I understand the need to be completely confident on their code before proceeding to mainnet, but perfect is the enemy of good.

Should still be possible with 1-of-2 multisig. You make a wallet for the task and deposit the amount to it, if later on you decide to withdraw you pledge, you simply withdraw all your pledged money from that wallet. Only way to make it "hands-free" and not have any confirmation prompts whenever a pledge is about to be processed is to surrender that bit of control as far as I know, but it's the sort of thing that's already feasible now.

@_date: 2019-01-11 13:52:59
IIRC Lighthouse relied on multisig to work the way it worked, and it was a rather naive implementation, which then caused problems later on. Basically, all funds would be "locked" for a certain amount of blocks, and until all the added transactions added up to a certain amount, but the way it was done was vulnerable to transaction malleability (If someone knows the details, feel free to correct me) and it required to "pass on" the file with all signed transactions collected thus far. I'm not sure how feasible would be to implement such "lock-on" with Lightning, for example, without retorting to the dreaded smart contracts. You could have an atomic swap in a system that supports smart contracts (Ethereum, for example) which then is in charge to proceed with an automatic refund for the value of such tokens in case the goals aren't met.
@_date: 2019-01-28 14:26:32
I don't think Bitcoin node distribution would be the most accurate metric, transaction volume as given by marketplaces such as LocalBitcoins might be a more accurate picture.
Just saying that because given Venezuela's internet access and speed, it'd be extremely difficult for the average citizen to run their own node even if they knew how and wanted to, yet our country leads the charts when it comes to actual transaction volume.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:31:27
Now THIS is what I've been waiting for. It might be beta, but it's good enough for mainnet.
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:36:42
Hope they eventually realize how pointless this will all be. Sure. they can "ban" specific addresses and make it so regulated exchanges knowingly receiving money from them could be grounds for intervention, but hope they're prepared to perform some sophisticated taint analysis or said "bad individuals" to just move their business to Monero.
All in all, a waste of time and money.

Easy come, easy go. As long as there's any worth on the concept, Bitcoin's value will never go down to zero.

Hiya, I'm still using it and indeed it works just fine. However you'll have to keep in mind that it's heavily I/O bound and for the first sync it'll probably take considerably way more time than what your bandwidth (and the speed of your system drive in which you're caching it) would suggest. If you can afford it, give it a sizable cache and make sure to back up and sync the metadata every once in a while in case things go awry.
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:48:04
It was nice while it lasted.
I remember checking it out right when it started out and it was a massive pain in the ass to even set up a shop... probably still is. Quirky as all hell, getting BTC into your wallet was a nightmare. But hey, it kinda worked.
Mind you, this was back in 2016, when they fucked up by manually sending a mail to everybody who was interested in OB *and forgetting to do BCC*. Now look where they are, I guess somebody will need to pick up the code and salvage what may be left for a truly decentralized solution if the leading development company cannot be trusted any longer (OB1 the company != OB the project, thankfully)

It might be too soon to use LN's mainnet, but LN itself came way too late. People are understandably anxious and if being  helps vent it a little bit, so be it. I'm not happy one bit with the development process and how a sizable chunk of it at the beginning happened at closed doors.

The same Coinbase colluding with Bitmain et al? Nah.

PIA gets pushed around a lot, probably because they've heavily invested in, uh, good will. I'm genuinely interested in knowing why.

They're well in their right to reject free money, it's a free market after all. As we're well in our rights to call them out, as it's evident they do so in order to play a long game and further an agenda over short-term profits.

And let's be honest, there are far better currencies for drug dealers. Any altcoin that trades for a moderately reasonable price, yet isn't held up to the same amount of scrutiny as Bitcoin would be perfect for money laundering, even more so if Cryptonote-based (Monero, Bytecoin et al) to make tracking much harder.
It's like they're not even trying.

Pretty of these are ridiculous in their own right. Apparently  you can't be neither familiar nor clueless about the process.

Make sure to nab whatever flavor of the month fork you might have along with your original Bitcoin for a neat little bonus, unless it was stipulated Dave gets to keep them? Not sure how he works.

Would these vouchers work for a Steam account denominated in USD? I'm guessing no, but one can hope.

That looks like absolute crap for productivity, though. It'd surely make for exciting afternoons that's for sure- especially if everybody is heavily invested on Bitcoin.

Check out their repo too: 
Funny how they bothered to change the LICENSE file to add their own "developers" while keeping the copyright notice on the actual source code files verbatim. Haven't actually gone through the code to see the actual changes they've introduced, both harmless and malicious.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:43:31
Keep in mind they filed for this back in 2014, when the US was still under Obama's administration. I really doubt anything public will come out of this, as Amazon has little reason to play ball with an administration that's so openly hostile against it.

I hate PayPal with a passion and use it out of sheer necessity. And precisely because they have such a free rein on your money and can freeze your account if you look at them funny, if you DON'T look at them funny or just because is why I tread so carefully around them. No crypto-related money touches my PayPal account ever.
Anything that makes PayPal look less preferable than other alternatives, no matter what, is good news in my book.

If you want to lend BTC- don't. If you really, *really* want to, it's probably safer to use a site like Poloniex or Bitfinex for margin trading lending, where the chance of a default is extremely low and your deposits are as secure as the site itself is.

It's unfortunate there's a need to register patents *at all* when it comes to Bitcoin, but defensive patents are better than suddenly finding ourselves being attacked left and right by patent trolls.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:13:08
I'm genuinely curious- if this is the case, why hasn't ever been a bigger hubbub about it? Or is he hoping for a quiet resolution? 10k BTC is a huge amount of money stuck in an exchange. Now, I've used Poloniex before, but always with amounts I can afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:53:02
Brought it up to them as well. Hopefully they'll give a good answer.

Am I being xenophobic thinking any business having ICQ as means of contact would seem dodgy as hell? Furthermore, it is just compounded by the fact this just seems to be a site that sells discounted gift cards...
Yeah, I'll pass.

Had to check it myself. And yes, it does work, is pretty much instant minus the standard 6 confirmations wait and for the most part hassle-free. A word of advice though in order to save a few bucks: NETELLER does let you create your first virtual card for free, however if you make it before verifying your account it'll have a hard lifetime limit. If you get verified then create the card, you should be able to define the limit to be way higher than the default (Which is $600 if I recall correctly) and thus your card will be usable for larger purchases without you having to create a new one beyond the first which does cost ~$3 or so.

And this is where you lost me. Badly-documented code is as good as obfuscated code, and unless you're expecting people to reverse-engineer your mess, then you might not as well release it as open source. Just imagine where Bitcoin would be now if Satoshi had simply released the code somewhere with zero context or documentation.
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:40:21
[This is what I see]( with a verified account and I try to make a Bitcoin deposit, and indeed I think it's just because you are unverified.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:48:04
Easy come, easy go when it comes to bitcoin prices. Personally, I believe things will bottom out at $2000 or so.

[Their pledge is legally binding]( and applies to whoever ends up with Blockstream's IP even if they happen to dissolve. Even if they wanted to use them offensively by conveniently transferring control to another entity, [they wouldn't be able to]( unless:


So yes, in theory they _could_ use the patents offensively to sue the hell out of their competitors, but to do that, they'd need to reach an agreement with everyone who has contributed first.
Usual disclaimer, IANAL and everything, but that's how I interpret it.

Actually, you can get Curses to work on Windows, but it takes some fiddling around. Basically using pip to install the right .whl from [here]( is what it takes. Best to double check which Python version you're running though, as it's possible to have a 32-bit Python installed in a 64-bit system.

KYC/AML makes sense for fiat withdrawals, especially those past a certain amount. I still don't find justifiable requiring full verification for withdrawing Bitcoin ONLY (Try being an international customer, outside US/UK/Canada, it's simply painful) but thanks for trying anyway. I'm sure there are customers who won't have any trouble in providing all the required info.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:09:18
Ah, yeah, that's a bit more understandable. A bit less than 5 BTC with current prices, but still a considerable amount.
@_date: 2015-10-09 16:20:04
Saving it for now, I'll give it a try if/when matures.

I've long since wanted something like that to the point of prototyping something taking cues from games like Entropia Universe, but real life has gotten in the way. I'd like to know whenever it's released as well.

Am I mistaken, or do you still need to keep the "full" unpruned version if you want to run a Lightning wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:52:32
I'm reminded of my dealings with inputs.io and the site is still there in some fashion. Person behind the site got "hacked" out of most people's money in it and I lost a couple hundred's worth of BTC at the time (I think it was the first time it spiked up to $100 or so? Can't remember right now). Ah well, it was a lesson I had to learn about not leaving my BTC in dodgy places, not your keys not your money, blah blah blah.

Don't doubt for a single moment that were it not for the political pendulum swinging the way it does right now, I'm fairly sure Gab users' discourse and spiel in support for free speech would be far, far more different. Clever, though, co-opting institutions, technologies and products far more successful than they'd ever hope to be in order to seem more reputable. A trick as often used by the left as it is by the right.

I use Electrum for mobile too which admittedly it's not that amazing, but hey, it works for the sub-$100 amounts I hold in my mobile wallet. I've heard good reviews for the Samourai wallet, although I can't personally vouch for it.

I don't know why a difficulty-based minimum fee hasn't been implemented yet for the official Bitcoin client. I know it's [on the works for Litecoin]( and I think something like this would work fine here as well.

And this is the main Bitcoin exchange and it's the standard from others measure themselves up to.
Still waiting for something else to truly come up and take its place. BitStamp is almost there but it's kind of bad with their requirements, and BTC-E is way too shady for my likes.
