Good news! We are still early adopters!

Just for the record, I have been involved with BTC since 2013 because I really like what it stands for. Right now BTC grew to become an investment and Yes its very addictive to see your “potential” money grow that fast. But since a year I started to look further than BTC and moved to alts as the tech is better than BTC and I believe in real life possibilites of the blockchain.
Look at SHIFT, they are about to release a working product (hosting decentralized websites) running on their blockchain. This is the stuff that Im looking for ����

Yes you are right. But in a property you can live. In a bitcoin Im still cold when the temperature outside is minus 5 degrees :)

Thanks dude ��. I do have the written private key, do I need to do that dumpprivkey thing?
Edit: and a backup is simply a copy of the .dat file right?

Cool thanks. There is a strange thing I dont understand. So Im restoring my friend’s 1 bitcoin, when I look up the public address on blockchain.info I see 1 btc coming into his wallet (the one he bought), then there is 1 more transaction from his public address that splits into 2 addresses. 0.8 btc and 0.2 btc. He bought LTC with that 0.2 but the 0.8 went to another public address. I dont understand what happened here? 
The 0.799 (to be perfectly correct) is still sitting at this address..
Edit: I just read that that 2nd address was generated to send the returning btc to. But I just tried to sweep the initial address and there was nothing in it (as its now sitting in a new address). What should I do?
Edit 2: got it! I did the dumpprivkey and saw it was another privat key than he stored. Btc are in my wallet �� Thanks again.

I’ve won the Powerball 10 times. Should I switch to bitcoin?

Running a full node will get you some payouts or it is just to support the network? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:47:02
Me too. You cut your meat with your left hand? :) 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:02:44
Cool :) How many full nodes are running atm worldwide (just to get an idea)?
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:44:24
That thing in your left hand when eating.

Ok I understand all of this. But what can I do? Is it waiting or is there another way to speed things up? Just want to know as im sure there are many others with the same problem. thnx!
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:37:34
Thanks. Have been using it since 2013 though :) 
But as I said, not been updated with latest news on fee's etc
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:15:18
I understand. But what should I do at this moment?
Can I change things on an already send transaction or should I wait longer?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:48:25
Im doing a 'Reset Block chain and Transactions'. Will inform if that helped!
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:12:50
How does this works exactly? If you have your coins in your own wallet (say multibit HD), you get coins on either fork? 
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:01:36
I would love to pay the correct fee, but as I said the wallet made that decision for me. So yes I should have had a newer/better wallet, but I didnt know at that time. Still no answer to what I should do. Will the transfer automatically be cancelled or is there any other option?

Thanks Dude. It worked, got my btc delivered! Tried 3 times and then it got accepted at ViaBTC. Couple hours later it went through. Thanks again 
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:18:31
