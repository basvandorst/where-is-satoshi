I believe the payment is onion routed, which means if your a node passing a payment through, you can only see the previous node (passing you the funds), the amount, and the next node to send payment to. You don't know if the previous node is the original spender, or merely passing through a payment like you are. You also can't see where it'll end up, maybe the next one is the intended recipient, or will continue passing along the payment.

With btc in an ideal world. If your employer pays you fiat now, then its not much different if they change to btc. Same for merchants, businesses etc. You would continue to pay taxes in bitcoin. 
Changes in price at that point won't be so volatile as they are now, so instead of it being a commodity, it would move into currency status.

So only the people who keep their coins on an exchange wallet would be affected? Well I think we've been telling people to keep virtually nothing on an exchange, always have the private key. So really some people would loose an insignificant amount of money that has yet to be moved to their own wallet, and some idiots that store everything in them.
Any dip caused by this would be a great buying opportunity imo

It won't collapse BTC. The issue is that tether is used by BitFinex (and other exchanges) to swap USD without going through the traditional banking system. 
Its supposedly backed by an equal number of actual USD in fiat. This hasn't been verifiable. So the issue is that if there is a market dip, and tether is not actually backed in full by USD, then exchanges holding tethers can't convert them into fiat. 
This is bad for all cryptos since trust in the system fails if you can't withdraw. In some cases, entire exchanges may be forced to suspend buying/selling, or worst case go bankrupt.
People point to BTC as most vulnerable since by market share most tethers are used to buy BTC. 
If this does happen and prices go down, that would be a great time to buy. I'd recommend coinbase in this case since they do not use tether and have insurance.

Large money moving in to be in a position to short a futures contract.
They then go long on the drop and rebuy to win again. This continues until the market cap of BTC goes up much higher possibly 10x or more making forced price changes impractical and expensive.
Weak hands will loose, HODL's will win. There will be swings like you've never seen.

A hard fork with a new pub/priv algorithm is all it would take. Granted hard-forks are difficult to get through, everyone should be on the same page when this issue arrises.
There are some known crypto implementations that are resistant to quantum (in theory). Though I'm sure this topic is being highly investigated all over the world (government, banks, cryptos) as that could break everything we know to be secure. Bitcoin will use the safest route when it gets to that point.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:04:16
To get access to any forked coins, you'll need the private key of the BTC you hold at the time of the split. The exchange does not provide you with private keys, hence you can't get them. It's a lot of work to add support for another currency that's usually doomed to fail. Though coinbase said it is crediting accounts Jan 1 2018 for any share in bcash since it's still worth something atm, may as well put it out of misery by releasing a ton of bcash on one day.

I would pull that 401(k) out so fast and invest in BTC. Then I'd start a monthly deduction to buy more for the next few years.

Happens often, it's called orphaned blocks. Say two different miners solve a block at roughly the same time then the blockchain has two valid versions. You see one confirmation now since it was mined. Now miners start to solve the next block, but they have to pick one of the two valid chains. You can see that eventually one of the two will become the longest chain, so the other chain is orpaned

If the transaction has RBF (replace by fee) enabled, you can resubmit the same transaction with a higher fee. Otherwise not much, google speedup transaction and you'll find some pools that take transactions, but from when I tried them they didn't work well

On coinbase if you're doing a bank transfer, usually it takes a few days, but coinbase will give you the initial Bitcoin amount you saw on the buy page, not whatever the market price is at the time of your payment clearing (for better or worst). Gdax loads your account with funds but you then need to place a limit order. 
So depends if you want to know exactly what you're getting upfront (and paying a spread) or your ok to wait for payment to clear and buy at whatever the market may be. 
Gdax doesn't accept CC, coinbase does just FYI

Maybe less forks like bcash and faster consensus on issues since he/they would have a greater ability to lead the movement.
But this goes against what Bitcoin is, decentralised. Having no central body and the ability to fork etc are also healthy. That's why they remained anonymous, otherwise they'd be shuffles around to conferences, interviews, and made to give their opinions on changes that really should be left to the userbase.

It's interesting how merchants, especially large ones like Amazon will see LN in the short to medium term. 
On one hand Bitcoin is not yet ready to be a currency since it has too much volatility. (A shop owner closes a channel at the end of the day, only to see a 20% drop). So now they need to play like a day trader, cash out now or tmrw. They need to cash out often since they can't (yet) pay all vendors, rent etc in btc. 
On the other it's on a clear long term trend upward, so it seems to somewhat offset the volatility if you can wait out the swings.
Amazon would love the 1.5% Visa MasterCard fee go away with 0 charge backs. 
Can't wait to use LN and hopefully never need to do stupid Fiat conversions again :) eBay should implement BTC multisig for purchases that need to be pended due to possible fraud or new buyers... Too bad PayPal owns them?

First, some general information for you I have gathered:
 Channel max opening limit
0.16777216 BTC per channel (or 16777216000 millisatoshi). While a channel value is stored as a 64-bit unsigned integer, the upper 40-bits must be 0. This is an artificial limitation that would likely be increased over time as the network grows.
 Initial max transaction size
The max size of a transaction will be 0.042 BTC (or 4294967295 millisatoshi). While a transaction value is stored as 64-bit unsigned integer, the upper 32-bits must be 0. This is an artificial limitation that would likely be increased over time as the network grows.
 Fees
Unlike on-chain fees that are computed by transaction weight, LN fees will be charged by amount. Fees are determined by each channel. Fees will be low (between 0.1% and 1% of the total, plus a few satoshi base cost) because of the economic incentive to compete with other nodes (transactions route through the path with the lowest fee.
Fees collected will likely not generate enough profit to run nodes just for this purpose, but are instead intended to give an incentive to full nodes for allowing LN transactions through.
So there is potential to make money, you'd need a lot of funds and a lot of open channels. You would naturally try to connect to nodes that have the fewest connections since you'd have a greater chance of routing a payment for a higher fee (sender has less route options)
Also likely, channels will mutually close when mempool / fees are lower, and may wait out spikes in traffic.
That said, there is a big incentive to keep channels open since closing them costs on chain fees. The idea being BTC flows in both directions often. You can control this by increasing/decreasing fees.

18 sat/b is too small atm, this might not go through and get dropped. ~40-60 sat/b would be needed for a reasonable confirmation, and ~140+ for next block speed.

On our way to implementing lightning network (off chain transactions)
It is meant for smaller transaction amounts (say $0.10 to $500 in fiat) to be instant and have very low fees (maybe a few cents?). 
Larger transactions in the thousands of dollars would continue on the blockchain, with fees not as much of an issue.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:33:12
I'm interested in the sudden rise of monero, which is increasing at the same percent as BTC this past week. I've always liked monero, but it sure does make a great way to hide BTC purchased by swapping with it.

Prob the fees were too low, so no miner wanted it. Don't worry you haven't lost them. It takes at least 72 hours to clear from most nodes. Try reloading or scanning your wallet, the funds will reappear.

This is usually referred to as the price spread, which is essentially a profit for coinbase in most cases. However some spread is needed:
- coinbase is holding coins at all times ready to sell in an instant. There are risks with holding coins that have a volatile price (coinbase may buy at 10,500 but needs to sell for less if markets drop)
- the price they show on the purchase page is guaranteed for a limited amount of time regardless of market changes
- coinbase may need to purchase a larger quantity of coins where the more you buy the higher the price.

A lot of major exchanges and services use core as their base implementation (with some custom code on top naturally). They are waiting for the next release to be out soon which will fully implement segwit. There are a few missing features that don't prevent them entirely from using segwit now, but a combination of laziness and the importance of security they are waiting on core to move first.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:25:26
I don't get how this effects BTC. I can see it's a problem creating arbitrary tethers that are not backed/redeemable. I get you can buy BTC with tether, but whoever is making that trade (to me at least) is the looser, not the Bitcoin holder.
Is the concern that exchanges hold these tethers and they would go under if it falls? I would imagine that exchanges know as much or more than we do and therefore should refrain or limit it's use. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:55:58
Well you'll have a channel open with Person A and your friend has one open with Person B. You send BTC in your open channel to A and your friend instantly gets the BTC from B. If your friend now wants to use the BTC you sent he just closes the channel with B and now the funds you sent appear on the blockchain as his. The blockchain won't show you sending the funds, just that the channel between him and B has closed with a certain balance for the both of them

Futures are starting so the big players planning to short are grabbing btc to drive up price prior to dumping them. They'll then go long and buy back, double win.

If you have a time machine than that would be an excellent strategy. If not you will most likely lose more money than you gain because you don't know how much the dip will be, and what the high will be.

My father always told me to listen to the media, community, and what if anything can be deduced from market analysis. 
Then when you know what the general consensus is, and what the market indicators support, do the complete opposite. The successful people aren't doing what 90% of the population thinks in advance will happen.
I'm seeing most evidence pointing to short positions with dumps, hence the recent rise for stockpiling the short. Story is clear as day to me, and to everyone who believes the correction will happen is wrong (according to me if that means much). 
We'll see the average investors and funds short, the big players will be long. Not only is price at a good point now, the long positions offset some of the buying costs.
Dump starts, story plays out for a week or two, prices lower a bit then the pain will be real for those who shorted.

So with a soft fork, we'd all move balances to a "quantum safe" address. Wouldn't that expose every lost wallet/bitcoin on the network (rumored to be 4 million) to become spendable once those are broken? Or will they remain safe?

I wouldn't worry, but [here's some additional info](
In other words the ledger wallet software always checks the nano via challenge response checking with known valid public keys. So the hacker would need to physically open the unit and possibly try to extract the devices private key from a secure chip which I would imagine would require tremendous skill and knowledge if even possible.
You can't make a fake nano ledger look genuine either because you don't know the private key to one of the valid public keys used by the wallet software.
So you'd need a replica nano, and download a fake ledger wallet. 
FYI each batch of nano's gets a new set of pub/private keys so cracking one won't effect many units. Those affected would need to be replaced

~~Wow I remember you asking this a day or two ago. Again,~~ I don't think there is any chance this will be mined given the mempool size unless you get lucky with a lottery pool.
You can't bump someone else's fee.
Luckily, this transaction has ["opt_in_rbf": true]( which means the **sender** is able to rebroadcast this transaction with a higher fee and will not be considered a double spend.
You'll need to contact the sender as he has to adjust the fee and resign the transaction. 
Given the amount of time that has lapsed, it's possible this transaction will be cleared from the mempool in the next day or two. There is no specific timeline for drops, most nodes are 72 hours unless the transaction is rebroadcast or some nodes are configured to hold longer. You might be able to rebroadcast yourself (just send unchanged transaction out to the network again). Not sure if nodes will reset their drop time, or if they go by transaction time.

Someone, or a group so smart that they knew to conceal their identities prior to releasing the whitepaper. This would make them targets if successful by governments, and evil people.

I never considered purchasing mining hardware in the past because I always thought "If they're as good as they say they are at making a profit, why would the company sell them?" Just plug them in and let them make you more money rather than all the extra effort of dealing with customers, logistics etc... I remember when butterfly labs was having pre-sales of mining hardware, and had constant "delays". I always thought they were mining them first themselves, then shipping when the difficulty adjustments made it more attractive to sell (if they ever did end up shipping, I dont recall).
This conflicts with my decentralization view though which makes me think having these around is great and much needed. 
Any convincing arguments that my first paragraph is incorrect?

1. Some large exchanges do not yet support segwit like (cough cough coinbase). This is because they are waiting on a patch release of core due out soon which I hear has better support for segwit.
2. A lot of people have regular addresses and are not yet willing to do an on chain transaction moving them to segwit.
3. Some people don't like implementing newer innovations right away since although highly unlikely, segwit would be more likely to have a bug than legacy. 
4. I think people should start using them, but the actual reason segwit was added is to support the lighting network. Once that gets closer to completion there will be a large increase in adoption I think.

Fees increase, delayed confirmation times. Then in between 10-15 days the difficulty adjusts so much that the network starts flowing again.
If 60% goes to Bshit their difficulty adjusts faster than ours,so likely we'd see a slow return of miners before the next difficulty adjustment. 
The only problem can be if we loose so much power that we can't reach the next difficulty retarget block and stall. The are pools like Slush that remain on us even when we're less profitable and quite frankly I don't see a stall ever happening.
Though you'll notice Bshit price moving up since our difficulty adjustment is changing in a day or two

It appears that the difficulty will increase by ~2-4% based on [fork.lol]( 


If the difficulty was lowered, price remaining the same, then there would likely be more hashing power.

My guess as to what will happen with progressively lowering block rewards:
- Miners don't like this, less profit -&gt; less hashpower
- Immediately after a halving block reward fees increase by a lot to keep mempool clear.
- Slowly over time the fees decrease, but always remain above previous average fees, otherwise the mempool starts backing up
- A lowering of the difficulty will occur, but will swing right back up again the next round, so fees stabilize upwards.
Hard to say that far in the future, with lighting network and a global user base fees will be certainly be needed, but will likely be trivial amounts as compared to now.

I can't see mobile mining ever happening. If it does however, it would be around the same time that battery powered ASIC's are released for mining on the go.
Though with consent, I'm entertaining the idea of browser mining on certain websites (desktops, laptops) that don't want/have ads as a form of revenue generation. It would need to be consent based and only take a reasonable % of CPU power.

Coinbase has $3000 weekly limit on credit card after you've purchased ~$500 (doesn't have to be at once) and then once that's passed wait 30 days.

I used 
Input transaction, click search. Then look for a button called "API Call" which will give you the raw output. Then you do a text search for "opt_in_rbf" to see if its defined and true.

I was considering buying it at $12, and just before I pulled the trigger it went to $20. I said now it's way to high I'll wait. Well I waited and waited till it was well past $200. 
Though truthfully I probably would have sold at $1000, I would have said 10k no way! So in some sense I learned the art of HODL after that and have been happy this far.

1.  find reputable buyers who pay in cash.
2. I'm not advocating this particular service, but [bitcoin debit/visa]( cards seem to be a good option, use it for groceries, bills, gas, and maybe even for your lambo? Be a little careful here, you'll need to make sure of a few things:
- Mix bitcoins until they are untraceable. Monero is good for this
- Do not give debit/credit company any real information as they could be subjected to a government request for information. They shouldn't need too much info anyways since they have no risk.
- Send smaller amounts to these companies, in case they go under or get hacked w/e

This isn't the place to discuss actual implementation details, bitcoin roadmaps, or to introduce formal proposals. This group is a complete mix of bitcoin enthusiasts, who mostly enjoy predicting prices, asking for help, having fun, and posting opinions on proposed topics.
That said, you haven't mentioned the lighting network - which when you understand it should give you some intuition on how things will play out. Many off-chain transactions with possibly some small fee, which would be aggregated together when a lightning channel closes and pays a fee.
In other words on-chain transaction fees will increase, but overall fees for users will decrease with off chain channels.

Yes, but as soon as you do we'll have reached an all time high. We've all done it, your turn 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:46:50
They can certainly do that, though by the sounds of things there will be third parties that (if you want) will monitor for this and automatically send out the punishment transaction (you get all funds in channel). 
Otherwise you'd be out of luck if you can't get on the network in time. 
I have no idea how this will all work in practice, I'm also learning about ⚡

1. Anyone can buy an ASIC and mine. There are many pools to choose from like Slush. You can join/switch pools anytime if you don't agree with what the pool operators are doing.
2. ASIC manufacturers will increase, driving down price and stopping the ASIC monopoly. However there is a small profit margin on mining, and electricity prices are the most important (next to a cooler climate). So some countries will just be better to mine in than others, however this leads to a broader decentralization of mining within these countries.
3. Specialized hardware is great at keeping large organisations and governments from overtaking the hashing power. There are many very powerful supercomputers in the US, China, Russia... but since they are not optimal for mining, their relative strength is diminished.
4. (optional) ASIC's are more energy efficient compared to PC/GPU mining compared to total work output. Less power is good for the environment.

There are very early testnet transactions currently working, and core team testing rates are near 100%. Not sure about the GUI work, as they intended this to all work seemlessly. My guess is a year for support to be added to core, and another year before people start adopting it.

The device doesn't store the recovery phrase, it only reads it out during setup when it generates the private key. 
So your question is then what is stopping hackers from stealing the private key?
Hardware encryption is extremely hard to hack, though no one can say it's impossible. The simple reason without getting too technical is that they provide the computer they're plugged into with a defined set of commands. The hardware on the device does all the computation based on the API commands received. 
So a hacker can't physically get access to the internal system unless there is a bug with the API/interface. Since the apis are usually small, they are well tested and cannot be broken.
