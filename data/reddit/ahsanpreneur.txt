If we don't trade, why should we HODL it? It doesn't make any sense to me. Whats the actual value if I HODL for my lifetime and never trade it? I don't think I'll be rich without trading but HODLING 1000+ BTC.

I believe in things that I have. Since I don't have gold, I believe in Bitcoin.

If i could identify a banker that stands to protest bitcoin but hodling bitcoin. I guess there are many, because they already believed in btc. The fair forced them to raise voice against bitcoin.

You called moon when a website is down? I'd say coinbase even can't pay the web host for a higher expensive package with unlimited capability. This signs dumping.

Go to [r/confession]( and speak out yourself. If you don't feel like you shouldn't speak there, keep calm and HODL.
