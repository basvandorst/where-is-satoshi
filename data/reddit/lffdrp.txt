There is no more than 20x, maybe 50x, this amount of mining gear online right now. So this is still less than 0.0065% of the world's consumption. Completely and utterly negligible.
Perhaps you don't realize that this growth is going to stop... At some point the electricity consumption is such that people will stop putting more and more mining gear online. People don't want to mine at a loss. For example the Bitcoin network did not grow between July 2011 and July 2012 because BTC remained between $5 and $10 most of this time:

Lol. The data centers of Internet companies are the biggest waste of electricity ever! Tens of millions of servers are running just so that we can all mostly spend time on social networks, send emails, and share cat videos...
Look, the best innovations always come at a tiny cost. 20MW is nothing. The world's average energy consumption in 2008 was 15,000,000MW. I don't mind if 0.00013% of that is spent on a datacenter that helps runs a decentralized currency that is seen by me and others as potentially as disruptive as the invention of the Internet itself.

Right, but $0.15 + $0.06 is only 0.12 GBP. So the cost of sending a more reasonable amount of 50 GBP with BitPesa is 1.5 GBP (the 3% fee) + 0.12 GBP = 1.62 GBP, which is still a lot better than Western Union (4.9 GBP).
You are almost certainly incorrect saying that most people use LBC. For example in the US 92% of households are banked, so they have access to buying cheap bitcoins through exchanges, why would they incur the premium of LBC? And in the UK we have ZipZap to buy bitcoins in cash and their fee is only 3% (3% + 3% + 0.12 GBP still beats Western Union!)

Stop polluting Reddit please. Your story is false. There are so many giveaways.
1. Lack of knowledge. You claim "any research (like this) [is] bound under classified nondisclosure". This is false. ~~The Federal Reserve Bank is a public entity.~~ The vast majority of their research papers are public and non-classified. In fact, your own employer (the Chicago branch) already once published a rather positive Bitcoin report:  (lol, so much for your lies)
2. Inconsistence. If the government was really afraid of Bitcoin, they would instead use your research and its conclusion (big disruption, etc) to show people why it is dangerous and "must be stopped". They would not hide research that proves their points.
3. The US government is in fact NOT afraid, but rather supportive of Bitcoin. See  See the recent california law that declared Bitcoin explicitely legal. See your own employer's report from  
4. You claim a tipping point exactly between the years 2021 and 2026? Lol. Nobody ever predicts a major disruption from a new technology as happening exactly 7-12 years from now. We usually see 5-10 years. Or 10-20 years. Round numbers, you know.
I can't believe this crap is being upvoted here.

You better disclose right now the entire content of your computer. You know, just a "disclosure requirement", in case you are a terrorist. It's for the good of your country. I also want pictures of the underwear you buy. You know, in case you buy the kind that can hide explosives effectively. We need to know this. To protect our freedom.

eBay CEO never gave a direct answer, but PayPal director did unambiguously say PayPal is considering it:

False. Many systems already provide "immutable secure globally shared ledger", this is not the main innovation of the blockchain. For example the centralized ACH network in the US is an immutable secure globally shared ledger. The main innovation of the blockchain is that it makes this ledger *decentralized*, *trustless*.


This brings me back to my initial argument. If you do it out of "kindness" or "shared business interest", you are bringing "trust" in the system, which means the main innovation of the blockchain (decentralization, trustlessness) is pointless, so you might as well be using a centralized system. Which is why I said blockchain are pointless/unneeded if you already have trust.

(Thanks for asking questions and showing you want to learn.)
A lot of cryptographic technologies are deemed practically "unhackable". For example decrypting a recorded TLS 1.2 session to a bank's website, or finding a Bitcoin ECDSA private key corresponding to a public key.
You can build centralized or decentralized systems based on these cryptographic technologies, but this does not make them "unhackable" because most hacks that occur in the real world exploit operational security weaknesses, not weaknesses in the actual cryptography.
For example a hacker is going to guess a bank website's user weak password instead of decrypting it from a TLS 1.2 session, or is going to straight up gain access to the ECDSA private keys in a Bitcoin wallet file instead of breaking ECDSA.
So, no, deploying blockchain technogy to banks isn't going to magically make them "unhackable". Banks will have operational weaknesses, no matter what underlying cryptography they use.

ACH transfers and wires are slow because they are archaic, not because they are centralized. ACH is literally built on cronjobs running on FTP servers at the Fed, processing CSV files, but running only 1 or 2 times every day. That's why ACH is slow. (There is a fantastic overview in 4 parts at:  ) And wires are slow because they is manual work required, bank employees literally sitting in front of terminals, approving/reviewing wires looking for fraud patterns. Heck I have to fill out a PAPER form to send a wire at Wells Fargo. Imagine the bank employee who has to retype this in his computer. Doesn't it give you a hint why it is SLOW and COSTLY?
You seem to be under the impression that there is something magic in a blockchain that makes transactions quick. There is nothing. Transactions are just broadcasted over TCP to Bitcoin peers instantly, no paper form involved, no waiting for a cronjob to run at 6pm, no archaic stuff. There is nothing that prevents you from doing the same with a centralized system. That's what many financial companies did: a transfer between 2 of my Wells Fargo accounts is done instantly with zero fees, because Wells Fargo has a centralized ledger and they record the transfer right there right now because they trust their internal system. They don't have to use a blockchain to make this quick and cheap.

Well, your reasoning is rubbish.
If the monetary reward is not needed, the blockchain is not needed either.
See, the point of blockchains is to reach consensus without trust. You say "if there is trust, blockchains can work without monetary incentive". But if there is trust, blockchains are not even needed in the first place: just use a simpler centralized ledger system.

Bitcoin's technology can't be easily hacked (you can't bruteforce ECDSA, you can't preimage SHA256, etc).
But Bitcoin's deployments are often easily hacked (due to user mistakes: improperly secured wallets, etc).
