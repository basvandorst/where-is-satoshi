I mailed them about this earlier today - the issue appears to be with transactions where the input set contains the same address more than once. The first instance of the repeated address in the inputs incorrectly calculates that input's value as the sum of all the other inputs with that same address. This inflates the total value of the inputs, and with fees calculated as inputs - outputs, it inflates the fees as well.

The fees *are* inputs - outputs. The problem is that they are calculating the total input value incorrectly when the inputs contains the same address more than once. In the case of the OP's example, the input set contains 2 inputs from 1KJTGpNzYsFibLmq9WaTGAXQbhRFUgnG3z.

Not necessarily - as far as I know, the Bitcoin address is shown on the coin/bar (so that the recipient can check that it does indeed have the number of BTC it claims to). So upon receiving payment, he can simply convert that to BTC, and send them to the address on the coin/bar before shipping it out.

The fact that Bitcoin itself may have advantages over other currencies doesn't make those accepting bitcoins in exchange for products/services any more reputable than those accepting more "traditional" currencies for payment. Indeed, one might expect them to be less reputable, given that you as a customer have no recourse to your credit card company, Paypal or the like to get your money back should they fail to deliver. As always - buyer beware.

The scripting language used in the ScriptPubKey is intended to be very generic, making a lot of different kinds of transactions possible. There are some "standard" scripts which are generated, and understood by the official Bitcoin client and compatible implementations.
However, in general you can create perfectly valid scripts, for which it's impossible for a third-party to determine whether it's ever redeemable, or even what the destination address is (until the output is eventually redeemed).
As a result, such error checking simply can't be implemented whilst maintaining the generality of the scripting language and the kinds of transactions that can be created.

It's entirely possible to create outputs that require no signature in order to use (e.g. Simply OP_TRUE, rather than the usual OP_DUP, OP_HASH160, ...) such a script could be used as an input by anyone. However the standard output script allows only a specific private key (known only to the current holder of the coins) to construct a transaction using it as an input.

Since we're all for (premature) optimization here, can you squeeze any more out of it using power-of-two block sizes, allowing you to replace the existing divisions of price by successively larger powers of 10 to a single power-of-10 division by 10000000, followed by bit-shifts to calculate L0-4 offsets?
