These guys did the same shit to me.

Would you ask the same of fiat?

Ok, I'm farmiliar with nonce, and that seems like a solid concept for truly random address generation.
But does this issue extend to HD wallets? Surely if the seed is secure in it's randomness, then so will all subsequent privkeys no?

Then it's a iphone problem, not a bitcoin problem.
Bitpay has very sexy NFC interaction. 
Airbitz is working on bluetooth interactions, and it seems decently robust. What do you mean by brittle.
If you're comparing online payments, are you really going to make the argument that scanning a qr code and hitting send is easier than putting your CC info in manually?
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:41:50
Is this just about good randomness, vs. seemingly randomness?

What's with all the FUD with BC.i lately?
And stop dramaticizing 105 BTC into HUNDRED OF BTC, that's just click-bait.
Do you have any proof those tx you linked are more than just random transactions?
@_date: 2014-12-08 04:44:36
Is that shifting away from proof of work?
Is this what you're talking about?

HERE IS HOW THIS ATTACK HAPPENS:
Most of these attacks have been through bitcoin-QT which also acts as a FULL NODE
THIS MEANS YOUR IP IS BROADCASTED FOR THE WORLD TO SEE!!!
Step 1. 
Look for a hostname like this static-72-94-28-43.phlapa.fios.verizon.net
Ha! this person uses verizon fios? Obviously a complete computer inept.
Let's try their IP over TV. Hmm, no hit, onto the next one.

Well the hacker, amaclin, explicitly states that the problem was NOT BC.i, but rather he sent his funds to a well known, compromised address, for which revealed the private key.
Could he be lying? Sure, but he seems pretty straightforward, even if he's a theif.

You know who uses tor?
Protestors in Hungary when their government forces ISPs to block twitter.
Yes this technology, just like any other has the potential for immoral applications.
Is a free-trade drug market between consenting adults that actually make violence not an option a moral issue?
That depends on how your parents raised you.
Is children being victimized in a sex-trade/pornography ring a moral issue?
Nearly everyone would agree.
But that doesn't mean by using tor you're aiding the cause of pedophiles, terrorists, or god forbid, pot-smokers. I bet all three of those groups use burner phones to protect their anonymity, therefor we should all boycott the user of prepaid cellphones.
I bet they also encrypt their communication, let's not do that either, lest we be affiliated with their kind.
Trucks and fertilizer have had more efficency than assault rifles, are those next on the list?
You're ok with them locking up drug dealers, terrorists and pedophiles, and most people would agree. What about the Localbitcoins Seller who was recently indicted for running an unlicensed MSB? Even outside of this sub, most people would liken that to the gov't cracking down on craigslist.
What's illegal seems to change at a very rapid pace, what if the owning cryptocurrency became illegal, would you follow that legistlation.
What shouldn't change is our beliefs and morals. I believe anyone who wants it should have the right to privacy.

You do realize that the duration between blocks is the directly proportional to the secuirty of the proof of work algorithm, no?
Using the same cryptography scheme, 10 1 minute blocks would be just as easy to 'fake' or alter maliciously as 1 10 minute block.

A popular opinion of this subreddit, and one I share myself is that it is best  to invest a little of every paycheck, but never more than you can afford to lose, and hold until you no longer need to covert it.
I'll  go into a little detail as to why I hold this opinion.
I really see two outcomes for bitcoin. Bitcoin is the only development in the financial services industry I consider not only signifigant, but mutually exclusive from the current standard. The immiscibility of bitcoin and legacy money is currently demonstrated by the difficulty in buying them. Because bitcoin offers a completely new, seperate method of transacting I see two outcomes. 
The first being that regaurdless of chance, or how quickly, that bitcoin absorbs the full capacity, or atleast a majority of the worlds commerce. Anyone capable of doing the math clearly sees that if the world only has 21 million bitcoins to do all its business with, owning even one will make a person very wealthy.
The second outcome is that it fails to do so. Wether it be by a critical exploit of the code, cryptograghy scheme corrupted, or simply a mew cryptocurrency prooves better, it doesnt take off, and will probabaly become near worthless, or perhaps be a collectors item.
If you take this philosophy of bitcoin will either replace money or it wont, it becomes akin to a gamble in the sense that you either win big or dont win at all.
Honestly who knows what the future holds. But many of us are banking on the fact that the current financial system cannot sustain itself if 8t continues to head in the direction it has been and continues to use the same old bail outs and QE to effectively put a band aid on to treat internal bleeding.
Thats why I invest, I think bitcoin is a likely candidate to replace our current system,

According to gmail, my old account was put on hold on May 28th of this year. Almost 3 months ago. I had offered to trade the account with other sellers at this time, which IS against LBC policy.
However there was no funds held then, and it seems strange my new account would be locked so long down the road.
Is there any way I can have the ID submitted unlinked from the account and deleted please? Part of the reason I prefer to use your service is the relative level of anonymity.
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:43:38
Nothing wrong with ID if you ask for it up front! This wasn't the case however.

It appears that the SPV on mycelium is just wayyy behind, but everything seems up to date now.

How to determine if something is an altcoin:
1. Do they share the same genesis block and possibly some history further down the chain, but eventually diverge amongst two different groups of nodes?
2. Better ban the thread anyway.

Google "download ubuntu 14.04 LTS ISO"
Choose 32/64 bit depending on your hardware and when it's finally downloaded burn that shit to a DVD.
If you're tinfoil hat about your opsec (seeing as you're concerned about mail tampering) check the signature of the ISO with the posted one.
But what if they MITM'd the page to alter the signature?
Better check it from multiple sources...But you can never be sure. Nothing is safe.

Due to the fixed nature of the bitcoins issuance and therefore supply, the total market cap of all it's use has a linear corolation on its price.
When people claim the price will go up, this is not because of any perceived change in value, but rather they envision a future where many more people make use of bitcoin to facilitate remittances, easily pay for products and services, etc.. Currently the market cap being ~4B USD makes a very small fraction of the worlds wealth reserves. If bitcoin were to gain greater adoption as a global means of value transfer, this cap would expand signifigantly and relfect this change in the price of an individual bitcoin.

Actually his estimate of 2.7 TPS is more accurate. The claim of 7 TPS is based off of a few things:
1. 10 minute block size
2. All transactions having one input, and one ouput.
The ten minute average is a good starting point, but even now most transactions are larger than just one input, one ouput. Multisig, HD wallets, change addresses, and the fact that for privacy you should never use the same address twice all contribute to this.
I think the biggest issue for raising the block size is bandwidth. Drive size is already a non issues with the TB drives, but monopolies like Comcast and ATT are making it hard to move that sort of data.

Well thanks for the input, however, I found 1.2 btc in an old wallet I had forgotten. I was simply looking to cash out, not recover an investment gone south.
In reference to 2, I really hope you mean it will quickly double, instead of a 6 month verification period...
