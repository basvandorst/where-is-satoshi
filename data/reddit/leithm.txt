With fees growing as fast as they are, they could represent 2-3% of the block reward before the halvening, and 4-6% after if the price doesn't rise much.  That should soften the blow, and the community could flood the network with more fees if they want to subsidies hashing for a few days.

No one is arguing against software optimisation.  Is bandwidth above 10 or even 100mbps that rare?  It would be much easier and cheaper for me to  find 100mbs bandwidth than a warehouse full of 16nm asics and basically free power.  The situation we have got ourselves into is a great shame, but I am sure even Chinese miners wont want to leave fees behind especially as we get nearer the halving.
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:28:57
Suspect this is pretty normal traffic on an upward trend still only at 120K transactions per day but these busy times send us over 2 TPS
@_date: 2015-12-22 12:41:25
Why is it that asymmetric access to certain advantages (cheap power, chip fabs) is tolerable but access to faster bandwidth is not?

Please don't patronise me, everyone understand that global network propagation is an issues, tradeblock did a decent analysis of this.
But arguing that network resources are the barrier to entry for productive mining in the current landscape is ridiculous.
BTW my network connect is 2mbs this is not about me.

What Trace says on transaction fess is spot on. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:20:32
We are going to be at capacity during busy times and then some, until the block size increases or people stop using the network because it is too slow.
@_date: 2015-12-13 10:26:42
At best with the current limits the network can handle 250 to 300 transactions per day.  For the first time this week the 7 day average is over 200k transactions per day.  This is beginning to highlight the issue where miners often create blocks with few or even no transactions in them reducing the theoretical limits of the network further.  As a result, for the first time, transactions other than those with very low fees are not confirming quickly.
The seven day average for transaction fees is now around 7.5 cents, and rising.  What will be interesting to see is what happens if these fees keep rising.  Will miners start to more efficiently fill blocks to grab the fees, will the devs reach consensus on increasing block sizes (unlikely), will people stop using the network and move to cheaper alt coins.
To answer your questions the price is rising as utilisation is rising and confidence will remain high if people believe there is an efficient solution to the capacity issues, and yes many people are probably ignorant of the details.

I think this is a well considered and thoughtfull perspective, but I would urge you to keep an eye on the rate of adoption even if it doesn't seem to move  as quickly as we might want.
You are correct that most people don't care, but when it makes a real difference to what they can and cannot do they will.  
If it is difficult or expensive to get money to/from parts of the world that are hard to get money in and out of people will find a way with bitcoin.
More broadly I can see a point in the not too distant future where there will be 2 buttons on most websites, a Paypal one and a bitcoin one but the bitcoin one will be 2% cheaper and you will seamlessly purchase and sell through a coinbase/circle type facility.  At that point Paypal will have to integrate bitcoin if they haven't already done so.  Most people may never even know they are using it.

The inflation rate will cut in half in about 19 months time depending on the hashing rate, at which point it will be about 4-4.5% and falling comparable to most developed fiat currencies.  Bigger picture nearly 2 thirds of coins that will ever exist have already been mined (64.78%).

Not wanting to depress you even more but in March 2012 BTC was more like 7 not 70 dollars.  I know because like everyone else here I wish I had bought sooner too.
When you walk down the street look around, how many people would even give the word Bitcoin a second thought.  We are still in the early days.
If this thing becomes what we think it will, a huge amount of infrastructure has to be built that takes a long time.  Then again it may never happen.
For me I bought bitcoin the day I heard the word in March 2013 and wish I had heard it sooner.

However great a technical idea Bitcoin is, the commercial value proposition is based on being a more efficient way to clear transactions.  The more efficiently Bitcoin can do this compared to other payment systems the higher transaction throughput and income it will generate.  My suspicion is that if Bitcoin keeps growing for a long time payment processors and other businesses with a stake in Bitcoin revenue will mine, if not for profit directly, to secure the network and their businesses.

Hi Matt
If you look at the press and google trends for last month when the rise started there was really no news.  The decline in the trading ranges meant we put a pretty good floor in after Gox and the China thing and Barry Silbert and others tweeted about a month ago that all of the bad news was pretty much priced in.  Mostof the announcements came in well after a distinct upward breakout in price.  We just ran out of sellers.
If there was a catalyst it was probably Bitpay announcement of the 30m funding round and Circles demo at the Bitcoin conference.
From here we need to see adoption increasing (i.e. network traffic) to support a sustained and substantial rise, but we might get any kind of bubble and pop between now and then.
Keep up the good work.

Thank you for your feedback, and support.
That would certainly be a nice comparison.  
Our initial focus is on getting a good a picture of the real-world costs using the current exchange infrastructure.  For this we need to include some exchanges we don’t have e.g. Coinbase (you wouldn’t believe how tricky it is to get some of this data).  Ideally we also need to better represent the transactional charges, for instance based on the max fee each exchange charges.  
We also want to support “favoured exchanges” as in reality users will have a bias if only for convenience,
The beauty of this at the moment is that because of inefficient price discovery you can even make money.  One thing we can be sure won’t happen with the incumbent infrastructure :)
Please keep posted and we will let you know of any updates.
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:07:29
The price of bitcoin is speculation on the anticipated utility of the network.  As is the $100m + that has gone into funding startups this year.  
The price is not rising because there is no net positive anticipation of increased utility.  If the network is used more it will become more efficient and a higher proportion of value will be generated by transaction fees (currently 0.34%) 
Transactional throughput is increasing but whether it increases enough to support and inflate the price in the short medium term who knows.  I would say in that sense the limited utilisation of the network is holding the price back.

If your talking about bitcoin taking down the dollar it would be worth a lot more that 100 K per coin in today's money.

I think adoption is what matters now, I watch the 24 hour number of bitcoins traded.

The origin of this was a thread on the Foundation Forum a couple of years ago, it was a suggestion, that never went any further.

Only if you believe the core dev team have acted in good faith, I do not.  They stopped a 2mb implementation (BIP102) and did everything else to prevent that very simple advance for over a year, and then implemented RBF as if everyone wanted it.  As I said good riddance.  They can follow sensible development from now on but no one will care what they do once Bitcoin Classic is the reference implementation.

Increasing fee pressure is going to push miners to larger blocks unless they want to risk losing paying customers to other networks.  Rising fees, falling block rewards and improving network propagation (low orphaned rates) all support increasing the block size unless the prices spikes substantially to compensate for falling block rewards.

I was a lifetime member from a pretty early stage of the foundation, people payed their subs to support the devs i.e. pay Gavin, and he never did anything to distance himself from the foundation.  When it got into financial difficulty after mtgox and the price slump he tried to ask the group what they wanted the foundation to be, but things just dissipated.

Nothing will happen, until miners get together and decide to do something about it.  Core have made their plans abundantly clear and they will not change them now.
Edit: It should be clear to the Miners that they are throwing money away by not processing transactions with significant fees.  Fees where not supposed to supplant the block subsidy for quite some time, but it is happening now due to severe supply constraints.

I think people will be surprised how quickly fees at busy times will rise.  The penny dropped for me when Mike Hearn said criminals will pay almost anything.  If you are extorting hundreds or thousands of dollars you don't care about fees.  
Also don't forget how much currency risk users are willing to accept as Bitcoin is still pretty volatile.  
I would guess fees need to consistently stay above 50 cents before people move to other chains in large numbers.  But when they have moved they may well not come back.

The Bitcoin community has a great deal to thank Satoshi, Gavin and the other core devs for, in the work they have done over the last 6 and half years.  But It seems to me that now the real power lies with the biggest and best funded commercial players in the space.  I am curious to know what Gavin thinks about how they are going to shape the decision making process that their business models are predicated on.

@_date: 2015-08-09 16:59:31
The Blockstream guys are digging in for small blocks, some would say because they have a vested interest but it doesn't really matter why they are.  They have 20 million of funding which is significantly more than nothing.  Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle and many other larger players and exchanges have come out for bigger blocks, probably with approx 300 million in funding.  They have far more resources to steer things they way they want them to go. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:59:40
Choosing a subset of block is not average, just a subset.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:00:02
I suspect some devs would not support a block size increase even if transactions cost  10$ a piece.  Companies with 100m plus in funding aren't going to sit by a watch this.
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:47:42
Much as we deify Satoshi, it actually doesn't matter what he thought any more.  Bitcoin took on a life of it's own from his brilliant seed but it belongs to no one now. The beauty of the protocol is that miners can vote with their hashing power, can't wait for 0.11a.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:15:22
I respectfully disagree.  If whenever there is a disagreement in the direction of the protocol, and there will be many, and we need to try to find an answer in Satoshi's early writing that won't work.  I would go as far to say if he/she/they came back and espoused a view it wouldn't really matter in the longer term.  The strength of the network cannot be derived from an individual, but a generalised consensus of what bitcoin is even if that means competing forks.  It is just very fortunate that the commercial incentive very heavily supports consensus.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:41:30
Thanks for the background Mike.  Can you give any insight into how the bigger commercial players are looking at this as it obviously impacts their businesses.  I am impressed by how much they have stayed out of the argument as I am sure it would not help.  I am thinking Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle, 21 inc. I know BTC China's position which seems quite measured but these companies must be wondering how any kind of development roadmap is going to emerge?
@_date: 2015-07-28 16:34:23
Impressive work, thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:01:37
No it isn't, any substantial business can run many full nodes at near zero cost in commercial terms.  Bitcoin is run by the the whole ecosystem but the most powerful entities are those that have attracted 10's if not 100 millions of dollars of funding and are making money.  I don't think they are worried about hard drives filling up with 20mb blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:02:13
Three bips 100, 101 and 102 have been proposed by Gavin and Jeff.  Bip 102 could not be much more conservative and still no dice.  The point is the biggest stakeholders need to step up and create a body that sets out a clear ideological position of what Bitcoin is.  That would need to be broad because people will never agree entirely but will also need to be a place where decisions are taken and general trajectory is defined.
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:19:18
Thanks to the devs on here for keeping everyone in the picture, it is much appreciated.
Just to understand, is it right to think that if the incentive from transaction fees was greater than that of front running like this, the miners' self interest would be to validate transactions.  In other works can you claim fees without validation?
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:45:36
If this can prove that a hard fork with broad consensus can be implemented relatively quickly and safely it would be a very good thing.

Bitcoin is and always was a compromise the question who decides which compromises win out.  At the moment it is developers with differing ideologies, who I suspect have a lot less control than they think, even if Bitcoin core gets left behind.

No I think it is a bad thing that blocks are essentially now full, and fee pressure is building, I was saying what I thought might cause miners to act.  It may be that people just stop using the network or move to a cheaper alt currency if fees rise much more.

@_date: 2016-10-31 16:46:48
The people running the bitcoin network rightly or wrongly do not want to process transactions with fees this low (around 2.5 cents) at this time.
It would have been best to warn people of the new state of affairs but unless you are willing to pay 10 cents and maybe 20-30 cents at busy times, say during normal working hours, your transaction may not get onto the network.
@_date: 2015-11-05 12:57:57

@_date: 2015-11-05 12:41:25

@_date: 2015-11-04 12:58:33
In this context I think this is more than almost full.  Fortunately there are plenty of alt currencies that are cheap to transact on which will remind people Bitcoin has no divine right to succeed if it doesn't meet what the market needs.
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:50:13

@_date: 2016-05-12 15:03:11
Node operators get nothing today.  If the devs work out a way to reward the process of validation/archiving independant of the block/fee reward, that is great, but the resources required to run a node is an important but different question.
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:58:28
But the truth is today, a 9 cent fee would struggle a busy times, and a lot of people would say a 25 cent transaction doesn't belong natively on the blockchain.  If lightning/payment channels solves this than great, if not, the question is how cheap is too cheap.

Fundamentally this comes down to whether you believe bitcoin can/should scale over time to a cheap global payment network or is a settlement layer.  I believe in it should be the former but long ago gave up trying to convince people who don't believe that.

The fees in BTC are as high as they were in the stress test.
@_date: 2016-05-22 08:42:24
What is not speculation and is clear is that the dollar denominated price (which is what this thread is about) of the average bitcoin transaction has trebled in the last year.
My belief is that this will continue to rise until capacity is increased or people move to other payment networks.
Understand I think the fee market is a good thing, but such a supply side constrain in terms of space with a hard cap means it cannot respond to increasing demand.
I have posted what I think the economic solution is, but don't expect anyone to agree with that or the technical mechanisms for getting there.
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:29:41
I think you need to check your maths, we have been over 2tx's per second for about 48 hrs.  Blocks are almost full.
@_date: 2016-05-12 12:19:24
They cannot extend supply beyond 1mb because that is hard coded into the consensus rules.  The true limits of their capacity are a function of the efficiencies of the network.
@_date: 2016-05-12 13:37:31
I agree, but miners are also not obliged to do anything and each transaction has a cost however small.  Transparency on what works for them commercially will help everyone in the long run.
@_date: 2016-05-05 16:23:59
To con Gavin and Jon, yes I think that was not obvious.
@_date: 2016-05-21 21:59:01
The price has doubled and you can make the case that this means that the fee in BTC has remained simillar.  But most wallets do smart pricing now and the cheapest price they are calculating in dollar terms is three time what it was a year ago. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:10:29

"Even if we accumulated backlog for days or weeks it wouldn't be a big deal. Cheapest transactions would be slower, end of."
As you would say ...... lol.......
@_date: 2016-05-12 13:55:14
The upper bound is not controllable for any transaction or even group of transactions.  And for many high value transactions, a 1 or even 10 dollar fee might be trivial.
Perhaps a better definition of the upper target is the fee rate at which miners would endeavour to include a transaction in the next 1-3 blocks?
That is in effect a true measure of the scalability of the network at a given price.
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:38:59
That is a completely different metric, that is the total mining reward divided by the number of transactions.  It cannot drop  below 5 or 6 dollars unless the price falls or the capacity increases.  i.e. $1.6 million per day in block rewards divided by  250-300K transactions per day.

@_date: 2016-05-16 20:19:53
I fear the miners will not listen until another Cryptocurrency really starts to eat its lunch.  Ethereum is confusing and unwieldy yet has taken substantial market share because of Bitcoin's dis-function.  I have to congratulate you on what you have been able to achieve with bitcoin from the earliest stage.  Shapeshift is extremely well placed to make the most of whichever currency comes out on top.

It will take properly full blocks, not spam, missing out on TX fees will focus people's attention.
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:42:10
No we don't, but the whole block size debate is about how the attributes of the network will change going forward. The question is how and to what end.  My suggestion is that miners clarify what works for them commercially so users of the network can anticipate the cost of using it.
@_date: 2016-05-06 08:31:13
I don't believe for a second Gavin was in on anything,  he has only lost in this situation.  I also think we have to assume this was a scam, all the stuff about trusts ignores the fact that he cold have signed a message without moving any money whatsoever, unless there is some kind of covenant preventing that.  I am satisfied that asking these questions is now in the realm of diminishing returns, there is simply no point in speculating, because it is just guessing without a lot more information.
@_date: 2016-05-17 09:57:48
The competition is for processing speeds, and energy cost not bandwidth.  Each block issued every 10 minutes on average is smaller the a typical web page i.e. 1mb.

The block subsidy will be around for a long time, and fees are probably the fastest growing metric at the moment which is great for the longer term health of the network.  
Miners should and will always do what is in their best commercial interest.  That the network incentivises in that way is its great strength.  The problem is that without an upper bound fee "expectation" businesses cannot plan for various tier 2 services.  Miners already have an implicit agreement around other aspects of network health such as not  getting near a 51% network threshold.  
By being explicit about "intended" upper bound fee rates, be it 1 cent of 10 dollars we have a much more predictable network.  Of course anyone can send an transaction with any fee they want.

All good arguments, but as I said on balance I think Gavin's proposals are the best way forward. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:24:07
The real cost has been falling and is now between 7-8 dollars it peaked at 90 during the spike of late 2013.
It cannot drop significantly lower until the block halving or if the unit price was to drop because there is little more capacity.  
There is real merit in the argument that blocks should be full, in terms of efficiency.  Peter Wulle has made a good case for that. I just think if it  keeps rising it will act as a dis-incentive to new users
It comes down to  what you see as the bigger risk and from what I have heard Gavin's proposal seem quite reasonable.

Its pretty simple really.  In dollar terms a year go the total daily reward from fees was about 3-4k dollars its now about 24k i.e. 6x.  As the price has doubled.
3-4k in fees for 100k trasnsactions = 3-4 cents
24k per day in fees for 240k transactions = 10 cents.

Fees are rising faster than any other metric.  
The question is, what is the nominal cost of processing a transaction and a holding a full archive for ever.
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:19:08
Yes they could but it would cost them $10,000 dollars an hour.  Miners could then increase their block size to process that throughput more quickly nulifying the attack and collecting a lot of money.  The lower bound would then stop them having to process spam when capacity returns, or the block size could simply be reduced again.
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:03:08
Mycelium for spending money.  Savings on Trezor, Ledger or Armoury if you can be bothered.  I think Coinbase/Circle are fine if you don't mind the hoops to jump through.
@_date: 2016-05-21 14:48:21
Careful now.  If you look over the last 2 years, since Gavin implemented the dynamic fee calculation rather than the old hard code, you will see aggregate fees fell for a year.  This was as the price dropped, users got more efficient with their fees (better wallet calculations) and there was empty block space.  In the last year transaction have roughly doubled while aggregate fees have gone up six fold.  So the last year of your graph should show a trebling of fee per transaction.  What was your source as it doesn't seem to correlate?
@_date: 2016-05-31 08:49:28
People here hate Coinbase for "political" reasons which is fine, but they are very professional with millions of customers, Circle are great too.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:46:47

You can smell the fear in the room, great job Andreas.
@_date: 2016-05-12 15:20:10
I don't think anyone would argue against an elegant and economical way of incentivising full nodes, but that seems quite a hard problem to solve.
We rely on miners to relay our transactions today, based on it being in their interest to do so.  A reliable network is a valuable network and if they have minimum fees that supports that further. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 15:55:56
Yup ignoring that, the trebling in fees from about 3-4 cents to about 10 cents is pretty clear.
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:13:40
You got to make your own call but keep it safe, cold storage like armoury, trezor, ledger or in a Coinbase vault. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 22:54:57
No,  even denominating in BTC the price is increasing......
...and bear in mind fees are now broadly calculated dynamically and not a fixed number in sats.  As such the $ denominated value I would argue is the best measure.
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:53:40
The uk is probably one of the worst places to buy BTC from.  Coinfloor manage to  get a bank account with  one of the channel islands for a few weeks at the end of last year then it was shut down.  Sooner or later one of the banks will cave in.
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:46:53

You can say that about just about any asset.
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:46:16
Forcing transaction fees to go "way up" will simply enforce the view that the technology is quite limited in scale.  If this is true it's value will also be quite limited.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:11:26
A perfectly valid position, and I think no one expects the blockchain to support online sub 10 cent tipping, but equally I think Gavin's proposal's are quite reasonable. I guess we will find out soon enough if they have support or the small block argument wins.
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:01:07
Didn't think so.
@_date: 2016-07-24 20:27:57
The issue is not the blocksize, but lack of clarity be it 1,2 100mb or 250k, 1-10 100 years in the future.
Bitcoin is an experiment, but more than anyone knows an experiment in governance.  
Many people will believe it is ungovernable and they may be right.  
However without clear governance it cannot be trusted to disrupt the incumbent financial system, as the risk for big players to get involved is too big.  And they will stick with the devil they know however flawed.
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:17:40
The price will not rise substantially unless there is a credible medium term scaling plan.
@_date: 2016-07-23 18:42:24
Can some explain, how this is on topic?
@_date: 2016-07-24 14:35:42
I think if there was a clear and credible scaling plan in place, and a credible governance model, we would be much higher than $1200.  Yes all much easier said than done.

Coinbase is in very good hands.  Any idiots out there that think BTC is still a game should watch this.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:20:29
The only real problem I can see for the foreseeable future is that other payment systems “paypal” become sufficiently, frictionless to make the trouble of using Bitcoin not worth it for most people.   
The value of the currency is underpinned by its utility, so look for the online communities that grow around Bitcoin and don’t want to go back.

If you are in the US, try Coinbase, but by the time your account gets verified it might cost more than Gox.  Then again the price might drop.

There are currently dozens of alt's all with teams trying to make them get traction.

There are  a number of online wallets, blockchain.info and coinbase that don't require downloads.  Either of which are safe for a reasonable amount of XBT.  If you want to save a large amounts look into full client implementations or hardware wallets.
The blockchain (bitcoin event history) is nearly 10gb now.  Backing up your wallet will take almost no space as that is something else.  You can send money to an un-synched wallet.  And you can check wallet balances at blockchain.info.

Yes it is not Electrum.  Electrum has 128 bits of entropy Armoury has 256.  Electrum needs to connect to the internet to regenerate a wallet from the seed.  They are both great and very secure but Electrum is a less secure.

I don't know what that means?

I think you are correct that the disassembling of BTC in China is what is happening, remembering that the grey market cannot be shut down.  However I  think much of  this has been priced in,  if things had been left to take their course we may well be over $1500 dollars by now.  
Coinbase,  Blockchain, BTC-e MtGox and Bitstamps  subscriber number are all  growing rapidly which is more healthy that a runaway speculative bubble in China.  I suspect prices will be fairly stagnant untilll there is clear news of  wider adoption be it legitimate or not.   Don't forget that one of  the factors that kicked this run-up  off was SR being shut down and people seeing the size of illicit trade in BTC.
Back on Asia I think the news about Ka-Shing and Bitpay is very interesting particularly as he is based in Hong Kong.  Make of that what you will

From what I have read,  that seed code is sufficient to cover every address you might create in that wallet, as armoury is deterministic.  I think the website says this too.

From Wikipedia.....
 Generating tons of addresses
Generating an address doesn't touch the network at all. You'd only be wasting your CPU resources and disk space.
Also, a collision is highly unlikely.
Keys are 256 bit in length and are hashed in a 160 bit address.(2^160th power) Divide it by the world population and you have about 215,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses per capita.(2.15 x 10^38)[1]

You might want to look into Armoury cold storage.   If you go that way,  buy a cheap laptop turn wifi and bluetooth off and install a cold wallet.  Make several paper and electronic backups and make sure you can spend and restore safely from  the seed.  Good luck.

All of the above except, mining is for specialists with specialist equipment.  All of the wise heads have said spend what you can comfortably afford to loose.

If there is a balance make sure you encrypt (don't loose your password) it and if you need to make it really safe look at cold/offline storage to prevent hack attacks.
