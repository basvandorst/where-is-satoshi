It's a pre-distribution of wealth, for all those that choose to participate.  It's not too late either.  If you think bitcoin hodlers are rich right now, just wait.

Both transactions were from Coinbase and previously had 6 confirmations and had completed confirmation process.  I came home from work this am to deposit them into my hardware wallet and now mycelium says they are unconfirmed funds.  Am I going to get screwed out of these purchases from Coinbase? And am I going to lose the BCC for each?

I don't understand the hate between the two sides.  After reading the arguments for not wanting segwit2x, I get why they uahf..
 I think people just went with segwit2x to try and protect their wealth, which is totally understandable.. but doesn't make segwit2x the "right" decision for Bitcoin. 
Personally I'm glad I have both coins now. I expect both to be worth more than any other altcoins.

You talk about two years as if it's forever.  Depending on your age, your money in your 401k could be there for dozens of years.   It's substantially higher risk, but I personally put half my 401k into bitcoin.  I'm close to maxing out contributions every year and am comfortable with the risk since I'm still thirty years away from retirement.
Depending on your age I'd say go for it man.  I can't think of any stock with the volatility of crypto, and if you're very far from retirement age you want lots of volatility with incrementally less risk as you get closer to retirement age.  I'm not worried about the price of Bitcoin dropping for two years.  I simply think it's impossible it won't be worth substantially more in another thirty years.
