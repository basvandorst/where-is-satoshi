I would rather own a regular crappy mechanical HDD, than a fancy, state of the art, 10TB - commercial-server-grade SSD, that contained a BTC wallet, with 950 coins, that was stored in an encrypted file, with a 256bit key - they I had literally no way of ever knowing.

Make sure you build rapport and form a strong friendship, call it soulmates if you will, before you let on that you found the BTCs.

Using microwave, duh. idiot.

You can store more BTCs tho - so it's worth the added risk.

LMAO - that would be the funniest fucking thing ever.. You would have to go on a quest to find the pair!!
Speaking of - imagine being crazy enough to store an encrypted BTC wallet with 950 coins and stashing them on an array set to R-0.

Yeah, I don't have the world's greatest parental relationship, with either - but no complaints and there's definitely love and respect.
If I said something that sounded totally ridiculous and they thought I was making shit up, they might call me on it - but if I assured them that I was telling the truth - then they would certainly believe, that I BELIEVE, whatever the ridiculous thing I said was.
They may not believe it themselves, but they will know I'm not lying, simply because I said I wasn't.
And they would certainly never throw something out that I honestly believed was worth four mil, they might not believe me. But I don't really see any chain of events - within reasonable frames of reference - where the situation evolves to them deciding to better err on the side of destroying ALL THE MONEY, you know - just in case.

You never actually get a full TB despite the advertising! For like all other purposes, 1KB is 1024 bytes, however - for the singular purpose of selling data / data storage / anything to do with data. We'll just call it an even thousand.

Sweet - thanks for the key, now I'll split the HDD, you'll get the 500GB that doesn't have the BTC wallet on it, I'll take the other half TB. Hell, fuck it - I'm feeling generous - you can keep like 99% of the data, I'll just throw my share on a USB drive and you can even have the drive back. I'm just that kinda guy.

As a software developer - there are many many many many things I would do / try to find the key. But I doubt I would spend any / much time attempting to brute force a 160bit key.

I'd run a magnet over the disk platters, BTCs are actually metallic, so they'd all just fly out onto the magnet.

You could offer them 1BTC and still reasonably expect them to come through for you. They would hate you. And you would forever have a nemesis (I recently found out that if you have a nemesis - it means YOU'RE an asshole, not them)
