Add to the mix the fact the interests added costs into buying real state to live in is at all time low in human history, the amount of min wages to buy equal real state your parents or grandad had to face vs you is very different. Your is way fkin worse. By far. And you have cheaper loans lmao
In the center of very big cities in a huge growing trend are still reilable as investments. Buy to live in without rent? don't, at least wait till the recession kicks in, don't sign a life contract just before a lehman brothers-like event where shtf

stock (total ever produced)
flow (inflation or production  rate)
It measures change in scarcity, high s2f = less perturvance from inflation presuring prices lower IE gold
lower s2f = prices going up get eaten by high proportion of production relative to stock IE silver

First time?
Are you ignoring deliberatedly bitcoin is completly inspired in gold?
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:35:13
Shitcoins, most, yeah, as they lack PoW "cost", ie they're cheap to rewrite history (not inmutable), they also lack decentralization, so also easy to shut down/attack.
Bitcoin is the oposite, by design.

States won't buy bitcoin, it's absurd.
State funding requires fiat money or else they wouldn't be able to run deficit spending without limits.
Central banks neither, it would be self defeating to short thenmselves.

Gold is the new USD after mooning and looking to sell BTC.
