Actually I follow Chris on twitter and he has been quite prolific in calling the big moves this year. It's quite interesting to see a stock guy apply his knowledge to btc and also what he has to say about this bear market we are in.

Where there is no risk there is no reward... I am seeing $500 bitcoins and I want them.
I don't believe that Gox will always be competent, will answer any support issues I have in a timely fashion or will enable me to get a SEPA withdrawal more than once every 20 days.
However I do believe that Gox will fix the BTC withdrawals in the short term and I will be able get my coins home safe to papa. I don't believe like many that Gox is insolvent or are crooks as there is evidence IMO that this is not the case.
Its a risk to take, and I've made quite a few relating to bitcoin in the past 18 months, but I don't believe this is in the top 5.

Wow have you used any alts rescently, bitcoin is like a tortoise compared. 
Vericoin is my favourite at the moment, its POS it has variable interest rate, it has anonymous send function built into the wallet, it also has a thing called VeriBit which allows you to pay using vericoins anywhere that bitcoin is accepted using your local wallet or android wallet. 
Also you should check out URO, although it may piss you off.

Worth less than Protoshares and is a little bit more than counterparty at the moment... money floats around crypto so easily I see can this stock taking off. 
I think the Neobee concept has way more utility and value compared some of these crappy alts that arrive.
It will be interesting to see what the dividends work out to each quarter and if it will actually drive value. 
I'm kicking myself I did not pick up at pre ipo, Neobee has been on my radar for some time, I have not been this excited about a stock since last summer with AM and clone companies popping up.

Do you realise that a bitcoin is divisible to the eight decimal. 
A Satoshi is the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin that can currently be sent: 0.00000001 BTC. 
In the future, however, the protocol may be updated to allow further subdivisions should they be needed.
