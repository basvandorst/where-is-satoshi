I’m sorry, but what kind of world do you live in where $5k in Your checking is being poor? I’ve never had $5k in my checking account in my life. I make half of that that per month working full time. You’re doing something wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:36
Weird, thank you for that.
Blockcypher is the link Coinbase gave me in the app where it says "view transaction" how strange.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:35:44
$468 to be exact.
Not much for that much stress.
Good luck though, man.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:01:17
Not too great at reading the charts. How do you "know" there is "support" at 12.8k? Number of buy orders or what?
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:47:03
I have had zero problems with the Electrum PC wallet (offline storage). Really excellent program, and just to be extra awesome I have a 40-character password on top of my seed phrase. I haven't made the decision to buy a physical wallet yet. But the Trezor or Nano Ledger is my next move.
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:26:36
I've seen a lot of discussion on "when to buy". A majority of the responses were "get in now". Even when a correction happens, it's bound to come back even higher eventually, right? That's why I decided to buy now.
With that said, thank you (and everyone else) for the input! 
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:28:04
Alright, officially confused now lol. So my BTC balance after the split will just be worth x amount of new-coin? I won't "own" any new coin? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:01:04
Might as well give it a shot. Let's see what happens lol
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:24:28
3 blocks. :)
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:27:25
Exactly. I work for a financial investment company that THRIVES on investors staying in for the long term(you may have already guessed the company by this comment, since we are so passionate about it). No day trading for me here. I've seen the term HODL and I absolutely love it. Thanks for the input man!
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:50:45
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:13:35
Wow, woke up to this nice discussion lol. Thank you all for the input. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:02:25
remindme! 4 hours
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:26:41
Yeah, I'm expecting a large drop, with my $100 basically getting lost, but I wanted to see the fluctuation. My $100 isn't going anywhere, and once it DOES drop, I can only afford about $100 a month to put into this so I definitely agree with the frequent smaller buys vs large one. Thanks for your advice!
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:38:20
LOL, I love the analogy. That makes sense. But my big question still remains: where is my new "proof" or "account" that says I have this new balance, and where can I get it? 
I will definitely go read up on blockchains. Thank you for filling my night with information. You deserve reddit gold. Or reddit.. coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:32:01
Hopefully by 2051, $2M USD will buy you a used toyota corolla, and 1.0 BTC will buy you 25 houses and we'll all be rich early adopters. Don't sell. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:39:50
Coinbase has a major outage regarding credit and debit at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:18:23
Do you have any recommendations as to a cheap and/or free hardware wallet? Something I can store on my PC? How do I buy more through this wallet once my coins are in it, and what would you consider the best place to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:38:36
Just thinking about 1 satoshi being 300k....
1 BTC = $30 Trillion
Bitcoin market cap: $6.3x10^20
My $500 investment would be $3 trillion
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:21:07
That makes sense for the most part. So how does the new coin "show up" on my addresses? Will the wallet software have to update in order to show it?
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:11:31
This current floor from $4,075 to $4,200 that we've seen the last week or so is because everyone is hodling and waiting for Segwit to activate on Wednesday to see what happens. (that's my opinion anyways, but I'm not too familiar with exchanges. I could be way off lol). I've transferred my coins to a hardware wallet and I'm just going to try and get BTC off my mind until then. If it crashes, I buy. If it explodes, I'm still HODLing. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:50:17
What I want to know is how you have a $2,000 limit. Mine is fucking $50 and I've had Coinbase for a month. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:44:10
If I'm not mistaken, that's a little over $100 as of 10:40pm, not $5. Why are you giving this away? I have no idea (or intention) of cracking and don't know how to do any of that... but there has to be some other way.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:16:50
I definitely did research before I posted this haha. Do you happen to know much about the supposed upcoming fork? I heard that people who hold bitcoin in a wallet will receive some equal or partial portion of of the new currency equal to your current BTC balance, but I'm not sure how. Am I setup correctly to receive this? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:01:25
Whoops, my bad! I didn't know you were getting paid in BTC. I suggest Electrum for storage, or for extra added security, purchase a Trezor or Nano Ledger S for off-PC storage
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:41:55
I haven't had a problem with GDAX yet, it's very smooth and has nearly realtime updates to prices. It's a shame because Coinbase(same company) is such a piece of shit with their fees, and steals your money by giving you a buying price of up to 2 hours ago.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:32:15
You can avoid fees on GDAX completely by placing a limit order instead of a market order. Pretty nifty. I've been using it to buy coins and transferring them to my Trezor
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:54:32
First of all, never kick yourself for waiting. I'm fairly new myself, but I learn quickly. We are still early adopters and bitcoin is still very young!
I just posted a comment in another beginner thread so I'll copy paste it here lol.
Coinbase is a great start(even though they are slow right now). Just remember that if you buy bitcoin on an Exchange or a place like Coinbase, THEY own your coins, not you, so what I like to do is buy from Coinbase and then transfer to my PC wallet immediately. Electrum offline wallet is a great start, I use it and it's fast and smooth. After that I'll probably purchase a Trezor or Nano Ledger wallet (they're like safe USB drives). Just make sure you are reading up on how to keep your coins safe once you buy.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:31:21
This is exactly what I was looking for. How to set your own fee in accordance with the network itself. That stats page is great. Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:25:59
That's bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:51:51
A cash advance is going to have an astronomical interest charge. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:51:31
Coinbase is a great start(even though they are slow right now), but perhaps you can give your money to your parents and ask them to buy it for you? Just remember that if you buy bitcoin on an Exchange or a place like Coinbase, THEY own your coins, not you, so what I like to do is buy from Coinbase and then transfer to my PC wallet immediately. Electrum offline wallet is a great start, I use it and it's fast and smooth. After that I'll probably purchase a Trezor or Nano Ledger wallet (they're like safe USB drives). You'd have to ask someone else about buying BTC under the age of 18 as I'm not quite sure. You could take your money to a grocery store and buy a pre-paid VISA card, but there are fees associated with that. Just make sure you are reading up on how to keep your coins safe once you buy. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:12:08
Humor is dead in this sub
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:33:43
Trash the hard drive. Get a new one. Problem solved. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:56:23
Unless you are planning on spending it or sending some of it to multiple addresses, not really. The fee reduction is applied to the spending address, not the receiving.
With that being said, I moved all my BTC from my old trezor address (they call it legacy account) to my SW address, I chose 200 sats/byte (on the non SW spending address) and it got confirmed in less than an hour. Once I make another transaction using my new SW address it'll hopefully be a fraction of that :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:38:45
Are you not the author of this post? You just quite literally shit on your own words with this comment. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:41:00
You could simply lower your paycheck deductions, or withdraw your 401k (most plans don't allow this without a hardship document) and go all in. 
I have made a personal decision to take my current 6% payroll deductions and change it to 3%. The other 3% extra cash I have will now be going directly to bitcoin, regardless of price. I have automatic transfers on my wallet app set up to buy BTC equal to roughly 3% of my paycheck (they're usually the same unless I work overtime) in USD every pay day. Since those earnings are already taxed income I will only pay capital gains tax on my investments. If my 401k offered BTC funds or ETFs this decision might change but BTC is too volatile for the plan that I have.
I also happen to work for the company that provides my own 401k plan (I work for an investment management company) and they automatically contribute (NOT deduct) 10% of my salary to my 401k, so I am not missing out on much. It's up to you how much risk you are willing to put in your retirement outlook. I am not a financial advisor(I'm a data analyst) so I can't really give advice there :)
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:31:30
The segwit chain and bitcoin chain are the same chain. Segwit is just a way of sorting blocks if I'm not mistaken. It is backwards compatible. There can be Segwit transactions and non-segwit in the same chain 
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:13:59
There are plenty of ETFs and trusts that hold bitcoin + other investments. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:09:33
I bought in at 3500 and 4000 (Not much, $200). I'm not going anywhere. In fact I may buy more.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:42:13
Update: Went to bed and came back to see my coins in my Electrum wallet with 42 confirmations. Seems the BTC network is doing fine (on my end) but Coinbase is a piece of shit. lol
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:58:43
Down you go. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:20:22
I watched it hit $3,599.99 on GDAX and almost dropped my max $250 Coinbase buy, but then it jumped back to $3710 where I bought at. But I would've been seriously broke. Decided to drop the $20 left I had on my credit card. I seriously need to start putting money in an exchange with higher limits. :(
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:58:45
Already thanking you! I'm an introvert and make my own coffee/food. I got this down Thanks man :)
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:46:58
I sort of just check the price on Coinbase and know that I have x amount of BTC in my Trezor.
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:47:38
a $5 investment is currently a 19% fee. a $100 investment is around 3%
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:46:08

Thanks so much for the awesome information. I tip my hat to you sir. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:26:58
Just moved my old coins from non-SW to my SW Trezor address. That probably didn't do anything though, right?
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:06:46

What the hell is this lol. Anyone sending some random dude $410 worth of BTC because his screenshot of text says so deserves to be scammed.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:08:23
mBTC is actually mega-bitcoin. You just received 14.86 mega coins, equal to 1.4million bitcoin. You are now a billionaire!^/sarcasm
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:24:08
Coinbase has it's own delays apparently. But my fee seems to be 0.001ish (5 bucks). I just want it off of that piece of shit site and into my own safe wallet. I submitted it. Still pending on coinbase. not even confirming yet LOL
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:40:17

No, seriously though. No one is going to fall for that, even if you have good intentions, it’s too much of a risk :/

Now I feel better about forgetting to cancel my automatic $50 buy this week at $7,300 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:32
I can watch the prices rise on my iPhone widget but I can’t login. 502 error on mobile. “An error has occurred” on desktop. Thought it was just me 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:06:04
 I can’t buy most stock because I work for an investment management company, and most of the very popular companies (Pepsi, google, amazon, Disney, Safeway, etc) are our 401k clients. I can, however invest in mutual funds that carry those stocks so I’m good there.
I’m currently 80% LTC and 20% BTC. LTC is crazy under valued. I’ve stopped investing in LTC right now and am putting about $20 a week into BTC 
Good luck sir! And don’t sell!
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:13:31
You sound like someone from r/btc 
I’m not spending my holdings on anything.
I’m buying equal dollar amounts of each of the 3 most popular currency every week. 90% of my cash is in BTC.
What’s up your ass lol?
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:05:41
ETH and LTC are both very reputable cryptos. I’ve made a lot of gains holding all 3 main coins. Why are you an asshole?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:55:41
Bitcoin has never grown LESS than 1000% per year since inception(6+ years) so I definitely agree with you there.
Let that sink in.
If it's $10k in January and follows the same pattern, $100k by 2019. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:12:18
Because, if you didn’t notice, this sub is for BTC. Doesn’t mean everyone in here only holds BTC and thinks negatively of everything else
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:23
You could get a SHIFT card through Coinbase and not cash out. Just start paying for stuff with shift. But with the price being this crazy right now that might be a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:22:24
GDAX is 100% free if you use limit orders, however if you want an instant purchase you will have to wait. With GDAX you need to deposit USD into the exchange which takes a few days. After that, buys/sells are instant and free. GDAX covers BTC, LTC and ETH too. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:45:30
I would if coinbase fucking worked.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:08:19
This is exactly what I’d do.
No one in their right mind would put all $50k in bitcoin if they had bills etc. i wish I had $50k to pay off my car and credit card lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:06:46
Sorry meant average since inception, yes.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:10:36
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:21:58
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:39:45
Re-buy BTC, send it to GDAX, set a market limit sell order. No fee (unless it's the same 1.5% when withdrawing to your bank account). That's just about the only solution I can think of
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:13:01
I bought at 3500, then at 4000, then again when it dipped down to 3599 for like an hour at 10pm. Just bought again at $4500. No reason for me to sell, and right now even if I sold everything I'd walk away with about $100 extra in earnings after coinbase fees are taken out. Just HODL. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:59:41
Oh, it was black on the box so I assumed lol. That's a great idea though!
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:28:04
Newbie here, bought at $3500, $4000, then back at $3600 when it dipped, and I'm buying at the $4500 dip again. My Trezor has already paid for itself in the growth of my investment. NO SELL
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:30:08
Would be absolutely terrible, unless all companies started a mass adoption of paying employees in bitcoin while simultaneously accepting bitcoin for their products and services. This would keep the coinflow going

@_date: 2017-09-02 16:43:34
Why sell my holdings when it's only going to go up?
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:05:43
I paid $75 USD for my trezor (Had $50 in cash back rewards on my credit card to use, and the trezor was $125). Already did that. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:29:09
Sell enough to pay off any outstanding debts you may have(credit cards, mortgage, car loan) fix your car, make repairs on your house(or move somewhere). Put your kids through college. Pay for their dentistry? Just don't go buy a lambo or a mansion. Take a week vacation. Like you said: live normally. 
Hold onto the rest, VERY securely. That is a LOT of money. Consider writing a will, and adding bitcoin to your beneficiary section. 
I'm only 24, but that's what I'd do. You didn't say how old you were or when you were planning on retiring. Do you also have a 401(k)?
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:57:28
I can afford about $50 a month. So you're much better off than me.
That doesn't stop me from using credit cards during dips like these though. Lol. I only have about 0.26BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:13:08
First off never invest anything more than you are able to lose. No one knows for sure what's going to happen. 
We're at a dip at the moment. ($4600 from $4950 as of writing this) Buy now. I did anyways.
There are speculations that it will drop significantly during the Hard fork in November (if there even is one) and you could buy then. OR just buy at both times. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:04:02
Buying bitcoin with your bank account can take up to a week or more
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:26:16
Buy more during this dip and hold it
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:04:26

Most people make threads like this because they’ve already made a decision to do it, they just want some backup.
With that being said, if you really are, wait for the fork. Imagine having $3000 and being able to buy a whole BTC after the fork (that price is a complete guess, don’t quote me on it) rather than 0.5

On what coin?
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:16:40
Does it say "pending" on Coinbase yet?
If so, it hasn't left Coinbase. The transaction hasn't started getting confirmed yet. Coinbase is really slow with their withdrawals
