Think the social network movie. But bitcoin and gox. A story of nerds in basements and drug dealers (catch) making millions from bitcoin (valid info, share the "dream" of bitcoin through the movie) and then how gox stole it all. 
Starts off with some guys creating it.
Then miners
Drug dealers
Gox comes in (main plot)
Bitcoin millionaires and gox plan
After math
I'm also an actor looking for work. If you need any help or hands, pm me

ETFs. Buy the story sell the facts.

Gox was faking trades I believe....so no signs of that at the moment? There are multiple exchanges all around the same price.

Sorry I need 125

Yes I have, and I found the easiest way to do it through companies that are reliable is:
Using Mt.Gox, withdraw your funds using a redeem code. 
Then go to 
Enter the code to liberty reserve. 
Go to liberty reserve, make your account do all that jazz. 
Once its in your liberty reserve, go to their sellers page, and find someone who exchanged liberty reserve for paypal, western union, moneygram, etc. 
I find paypal the quickest and cheapest, then its deposited into my bank 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:25:34
So there is no way to do that on mtgox? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:14:28
I only have usd in my account right now, but 20 dollar chunks is perfect 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:16:26
If you use mtgox, the quickest way I have found, is to use 
Basically withdraw your funds are a redeemable code, then use the code on aurumxchange to liberty reserve, (you'll need an account there too). Then use their seller's list to find someone that will exchange liberty reserve for western union, moneygram, paypal, etc etc. You can get it all done in about 30 mins for paypal.

They seems very legit, their ad about being tested everyday was pretty cool
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:29:38
Thats what I thought but I'd like to know some peoples experiences. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:30:43
Same thing. Today in fact. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:43:45
I guess not, can you explain
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:33:46
Thats my only issue, is that it seems like its a small exchange. It would be great if this post got more people to join it. But the thing is, even though its small, does that effect trading at all? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:41:57
But does it affect the ability to get sells and buys? Like on mtgox as long as its at the market price i will get a sell/buy. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:40:27
itll rise back up when there isnt lag. everytime it has bad lag the price drops. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:08:38
Can someone explain why this isnt a good idea? and is that the reason the price is dropping?
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:14:11
I will get with you later today, but as long as we can do it in chunks that is fine. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:35:40
Campbx. So far it's amazing. The only thing is the small amount of users. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:35:35
YES! and money orders! and they are american based, list their address, and seem to have great costumer support.
PLUS, the website looks great.
