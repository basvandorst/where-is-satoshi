@_date: 2017-12-22 00:20:05
Is this a FACT or something you heard?? Has it happened to u where an unconfirmed got sent back to you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:33:14
Well I think I read someone claiming that it gets put back in your wallet after two weeks depending on what wallet you use and they mentioned bread wallet they didn’t talk about electrum though
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:09:18
Dam what happens if bitrex goes down or gets hacked?? I hope my calculations are wrong OMG I sent .43 BTC with 6.2 mbtc fee what’s worst case scenario??  What would you do ??
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:47:42
It was .5 BTC so 344sats/bytes is that too low??

@_date: 2017-12-21 01:21:43
What now?? What happens if bitrex goes down? What happens to my savings ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:10:59
Ok perfect so I don’t have to count this as a loss right 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:55:00
 “The coins are going to go back to its original wallet no matter what if it’s not processed on the blockchain. That’s by design of the blockchain so you don’t loose your coins”
Man I hope u know this for a fact...and ok I understand. And yeah electrum let’s u replace the fee once if u sent really low first time.... other wise like in my case I did a 6.2 MBTC fee and won’t let me replace because it wasn’t so low....I was ignorant to the number of transactions in the mempool at the time.  FUCK
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:43:04
Yeah I have I’ve used them for a while and held a couple thousand there for weeks and withdrew easily 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:30:35
Dam I used electrum smh I thinks it might be different 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:01:43

@_date: 2017-12-21 03:42:36
