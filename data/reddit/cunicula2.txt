Neither of those are actual issues for NG. Think of it as "Bitcoin, but instead of the miner deciding what happened in the last 10 minutes, the miner decides things as they happen."

There's an alternative service out there that generalizes proof-of-existence called [Virtual Notary]( It can attest not only to documents, but to amount of Bitcoins someone holds, the air temperature, tweets, housing value, exchange rates and a ton of other online factoids. Like in this video, it also records the information efficiently in the blockchain, as well as provide you with a certificate that you can then use later independently and offline.
