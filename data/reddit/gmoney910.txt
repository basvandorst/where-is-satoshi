Because Bitcoins themselves were a conspiracy to begin with, and the only ones to hop on were the conspiracy theorists who had faith in their own theories.

Wow I wish I had known about this, I have the laptop but the hard drive got damaged big time in an accident and I can't turn it on do I might be screwed, but do you have any idea where I could find this guy?

I wish there was a place to ask for Bitcoin like kickstarter.

How do i get back my $2500 worth in BTC i sent to the wrong address, a no-longer-accessible one? OHHHH i dont

I sent about $5,000 worth in btc last year to an address, only to find out moments later that the address had been updated and the old one scrapped. I wish there was a way to reverse this, seems like the biggest waste of 5 grand ever

You have it spot on! I mean I never post here even though I am an avid lurker/user of Bitcoin, but I think that your idea is perfect. So many more people would get into Bitcoin!

Yeah I honestly don't have much hope that it will work, since it's been so long, broken laptop, etc but I really appreciate you letting me know about that. Makes me much more comfortable with large transactions. If by some ridiculously small Chance that I get the coins back, I'll be throwing some your way. Thanks again!
