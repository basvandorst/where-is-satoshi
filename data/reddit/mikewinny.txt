It simply isn't a 'float'. An integer - "a number that can be written **without** a fractional component" - is the perfect abstraction for a perfectly precise number. No other or additional abstraction is needed.


If you are referring to the term 'spaghetti code', it is more commonly accepted to mean code structure or program flow lacking notably in structure and organisation. What you describe is i believe more commonly known as 'dynamic typing'.
Anecdote: Having in recent months been 'coding my ass off' writing one of these new-fangled, single-page web applications, i really miss not having an integral number type [in JavaScript]. More often than not it would be useful to have that piece of mind that comes with knowing exactly what kind of value to expect.

Sorry but i call BS. A hard drive - of the antiquated rotating variety - is not typically slower than one's internet connection. Theoretically, one would need a 1gb/s internet connection before approaching HDD bandwidth limits (~100MiB/s for single, commodity SATA drive). Of course, with such a connection a 1TiB blockchain could be downloaded in 3 hours. I'm not saying there isn't a scalability problem as obviously *something* will need implementing.

Are you advocating that all development on cryptographic hashing and related fields cease, having settled on an algorithm that is **currently** uncompromised?


Given the ever advancing power of computing, knowledge of ciphers and attacks, surely it is better to constantly push for more robust algorithms? Nobody is saying that it should be urgently, immediately adopted; quite the opposite. It's still hugely beneficial to the cryptography field.

Ah i do apologise. I had taken your comment to mean that its the device speed that was the limiting factor as opposed to sub-optimal implementation of the I/O routines in the software.
Argh. If i could spare the time i would really like to look into the code myself. At least out of curiosity.
