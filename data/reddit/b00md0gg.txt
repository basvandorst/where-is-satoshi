@_date: 2017-10-14 11:41:47
what site did you use?
coinmama is a great one.
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:59:37
I didn't know u could buy on blockchain. As far as I know it is just an online wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:16:46
Lol. This is a low risk investment. That isn't including the increasing btc value 
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:56:41
Nice assumption. How did you come to that conclusion without asking a single question?
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:47:48
On my ledger I did bitcoin segwit. Seems to work well.

Not being funny, but why would u even work if he ballin that hard? You only got one life and if u don't have to work just live it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:08:17
Ok bro.
Not point explaining to you because you already asssuned the worst but it isn't a scam and it is a registered trading company that is heavily regulated. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:53:06
Wow man. Just wow. The reason why you can't contact that dude Erik is cause he has the private key and is living the dream. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:01:38
Don't be a pussy. I'm all in this game. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:26:11
that is what these layer 2 implementations are about. trying to turn BTC into gold. Instead of trading BTC we trade tokens backed by BTC. then they take the BTC backing away and then we are back to the world of fiat currency in digital form :)

My cousin paid 6 btc for 3 vials once. Was a good deal back then and now the most expensive gear in the world lol
@_date: 2017-10-31 08:03:49
No I just think Erik knew this guy wasn't at his level and kept a copy of the private key
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:11:27
