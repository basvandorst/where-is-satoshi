Only took about an hour and a half lol, faster than if we ran his credit card through Square or Quickbooks or anything like that or if he were to PayPal us and we were to wait a day for it to transfer to our bank. :)

Figured into the amount he paid, converted to USD at the necessary BTC/USD trade price so taxes are in USD at the correct total.

@_date: 2017-12-09 06:57:24
Yeah just a direct transaction and then converted to USD at no commission at an approximately correct trade price. Didn't make or lose anything since receiving it unfortunately but for accounting purposes we converted it to USD. Maybe eventually we'll set ourselves up with a BTC wallet for the business once I can learn more about accounting for it. I know I'll wish I hodl'd but it is what it is, best to keep business money and personal investments separate

Maserati Levante came out at the end of last year so even when Bitcoin was at its lowest since then, the car would still only be worth 120 BTC.

@_date: 2017-02-24 05:33:59
Same here honestly, was just thinking about it a few minutes actually. Normally when the price is going crazy I'm glued to my screen watching the markets, today I've barely looked. Feels pretty good.
@_date: 2017-02-16 02:41:23
The Maserati Levante only went on sale near the end of 2016 so probably not
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:52:02
Does this apply to if you keep your coins in an online exchange too such as coinbase (as bad as it is, I still haven't gotten around to getting a hardware wallet)? Like will Coinbase automatically reflect my BTC and BTU after the fork?
@_date: 2017-01-22 05:14:39
Happened to me a few times. A few refreshes or waiting a few minutes usually solves it though.
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:20:58
I hope she hodl'd
@_date: 2017-01-11 03:20:08
I'd suggest dollar cost average over the course of the year. If you have faith in the future of bitcoin, you could buy all at once though and not worry about price for a year or so.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:44:02
I'm just gonna keep hodling till at least 1200 lol
@_date: 2017-01-14 20:36:06
Good for you

He could mine in a pool while using azure couldn't he?
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:55:56
Mine seems fine at the time of this writing
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:14:10
Gotcha, that makes sense. I appreciate the info!
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:59:37
Will wait for someone else to comment on your primary issue since I don't want to speculate without any certainty, but to answer your question about your Coinbase wallet address, Coinbase changes your wallet address after every transaction you make to increase privacy, so that people can't look up every transaction you've made under one address. All of your addresses with Coinbase are still valid and associated with your account though, so no worries there. You can see all your coinbase addresses here:  
See  for more info
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:30:07
figured it was too good to be true
@_date: 2017-01-12 06:22:38
I contacted Coinbase Support 6 days ago and haven't heard back on my case. My case isn't even showing up in my account :/
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:35:10
Wasn't this thread just here a minute ago and someone called it out as a scam?
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:04:38
Probably would be better than mining on an average computer's CPU, but still would fall very short of ASIC mining capabilities. I wouldn't expect too much btc profit from it, but I may be wrong. But if they're credits you have no other use for and no cost to you, whatever it can mine is better than nothing.
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:14:26
Sent an email, hopefully I hear back in a timely manner. I still haven't heard back on a previous support case I submitted a few days ago, so I summarized that issue in this second email as well. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:42:09
It's working now. I refreshed several times and cleared caches but the candlesticks and prices were still messed up for probably 30 minutes or so. Was saying the price was plummeting down to like the $400s so I was confused. Checked on Twitter and it seems a few other people had the problem
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:02:24
Depends what you're mining with. I just do casual GPU mining of altcoins when I'm not using my computer and exchange it for BTC. Makes about $1 or so a day worth of BTC. I just use Nicehash Miner to mine the most efficient algorithms and it does a pretty good job. I'm not big into mining and haven't invested into any mining rigs though, so there might be better options if you have.
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:05:06
Having the same problem. Was having connectivity issues to the Android app on Wednesday and told that my requests were timing out when I went to buy, but two of them went through. I only wanted one to go through so I made a case with coinbase support but not sure of the status of it.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:56:56
Looking like today might be a good day :) 
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:08:02
Please elaborate, I'm curious as to how because I think it's pretty cool to see a large online merchant like NewEgg accepting it.
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:55:52
I bought my first bitcoins at $1140 on Wednesday after watching it rise for months and reading reports and speculation that Bitcoin could be expected to reach $2000 or more this year. A little bit of guilt on buying it then instead of waiting one more day to buy at $900 or so, but either way I'm just going to hodl for a while and maybe buy some more while I continue to learn the market better
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:07:06
I wasn't aware ZCash is a scam coin. I was mining it for a little while, what about it is a scam? Altcoin noob here so I'm curious
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:07:57
For once I wake up and Bitcoin isn't down another $100 from the night before :D
@_date: 2017-01-12 01:14:16
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:09:45
Give it a shot then lol. With $500k credit I'm sure you'll come out with some decent btc profit. Would be curious to see how it goes so keep us updated!
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:09:50
It wasn't the first time it passed $1000, it won't be the last (theoretically). I also bought at ~$1100 but just gotta suck it up and be patient for it to go back up again. You haven't lost anything yet technically until you sell your bitcoins, so if you don't want to be at a loss, just hodl.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:12:36
Yeah coinbase is down for everyone right now
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:41:02
Why? What's the motive or catch?
@_date: 2017-01-28 05:25:19
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:42:39
Don't invest more than you're willing to lose
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:57:14
I don't store by coins on Coinbase anymore but still use their app because honestly it's the best app to monitor the price of BTC, ETH and LTC I've found on Android.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:19:48
I've been watching  instead, it stays better updated on website status
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:37:02
That happened to me yesterday and took hours for it to actually let me log in.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:18:54
Crowded I'd say, they've been having a lot of ups and downtimes the past 24 hours with all the market fluctuation. As of the time of this writing though they seem to have gotten everything back up.
@_date: 2017-01-11 03:29:39
Scam. Someone ban this guy he's been doing this repeatedly
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:18:06


Didn't have to read any further
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:52:53
That one month though
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:49:25
I am still in it, and my interest in it has definitely increased quite a bit compared to when I was first into it. I bought back in shortly before ETH hit $100, I think around $80-85, and have continued to buy small increments over the past couple weeks as its risen. Also just invented a few thousand in miners for myself and two of my close friends. Started building them in the past week and they're already profitable. Definitely an interesting time in the crypto world!
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:37:03
I mean I guess? Lol. I didn't know it was wrong to buy Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:53:50
Lol I haven't heard someone mention OneCoin in a long time. I remember when someone tried to recruit me into that LMAO
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:30:07
Interested to hear what happens with this because I just referred some people yesterday who will be buying soon.
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:19:35
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:13:35
It's not too late! (for now)
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:31:39
Invest as much as you're willing to lose. It could fall some percent tomorrow, or it could rise. If it rises, you'll be telling yourself you wished you bought when it was at 2.1k, so with that, 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:21:42
I heard about it back when I was in high school. Around 2011-2013. I believe I'd also seen some mentions of it online before that but never looked into it. I didn't research it back then as much as I wish I did. I tried mining but didn't have a decent computer at the time, and got bored of it very quickly after mining only around 0.1 BTC. Oh how I wish I could go back in time.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:18:54
Nah I'm good. Savings account is just a fraction of my long term investments, not afraid to lose it and honestly putting it into Bitcoin is much more exciting for me.
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:03:15
Link to video?
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:47:41
1700 on Coinbase/GDAX!
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:42:08
Wouldn't call it greed. It's just that I'd rather have more in it than I've had up until now.
@_date: 2017-05-16 04:49:27
I referred a friend the other day, he made his required purchase for us to each get the referral bonus, and as of yet neither of us have been charged for the referral. Not sure what the issue you had was tbh but I can't replicate it.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:21:29
What's your electricity cost where you're at? Power supplies included?
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:05:16
Change your price chart to 1 month view or even better 1 year view and you'll be able to smile again
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:23:44
Oh I know. It's not like it's my first Bitcoin purchase, so I'm taking a risk, but have faith that it will continue to rise. It's funds out of my savings account anyways, so it's not like I'd need those funds any time soon. Will just continue to hodl as I've done up until now, never sold (except that one time I sold my ETH for BTC when ETH was at $12, kinda regret that one).
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:30:10
I'll look at Electrum this afternoon and will go with that most likely. Thanks! I was looking to buy a Ledger a few weeks ago but at the time I looked they were backordered a good bit. It's still on my to-do list to get one, but doesn't look like that will happen before the fork.
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:33:46
2 days is nothing if you just hodl
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:15:10
None I can't afford to lose
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:01:46
All you had to do was see his username lol
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:21:30
I'd take it either way. I wouldn't complain about 1 BTC, but at the same time if I got the USD then I'd maybe buy 0.5 BTC and diversify the rest.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:04:08
Yeahh that is the lame part about it. I can never manage to buy the dip :/
