? after the younger dryas the human population likely dropped to the lowest it has ever been, directly caused by climate change

yeah we arent disagreeing, but you underestimate the fragility of our civilisation. look at rome, look at all the Mediterranean civilisations that  somehow all disappeared completely around 1100-900bc, leaving only the Ancient Egyptians (in a very weak state, never to be what they were). thats 9 of the most powerful, most advanced civilisations gone in a period of 50-150 years. what happened? trade routes got fucked because of a couple of devastating earthquakes in modern day turkey and greece, and some western Mediterranean civilisations invading through greece and turkey and boom, they are all gone. today we are better at organising efforts to help those in need, but if multiple things happen to multiple countries then the chance of recovery drops dramatically. if you want to shit yourself look into the comet hypothesis of the younger dryas, if that shit happened today...no guarantees on what would happen

little is an overstatement, if there is any serious short time climate change, most of the civilised world will perish if there isnt a centralised effort to save those people. no food supply, no electricity, no survivor skills, most of the civilised world is fucked.
