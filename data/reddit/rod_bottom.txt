US Shale Oil Industry: Catastrophic Failure Ahead
[ the U.S. Shale Industry produces a record amount of oil, it continues to be plagued by massive oil decline rates and debt.  Moreover, even as the companies brag about lowering the break-even cost to produce shale oil, the industry still spends more than it makes.  When we add up all the negative factors weighing down the shale oil industry, it should be no surprise that a catastrophic failure lies dead ahead.

Swing in the dark, and a miss. The chain I'm betting on is not PoS.
Once a green chain achieves the security bitcoin is envious of, how long would it take to strand all those bitcoin mining assets and make them worthless, while converting to the superior protocol?
Bitcoin will not be able to adapt ... and if after years of infighting, the adaptation will be too late.

"PoS, or similar" 
New to reddit would mean I haven't deleted past accounts so to maintain an amount of security. 
As for my investment, it's irrelevant since this is on Bitcoin and will remain on topic.
Again. How does someone convince miners to have their investments become worthless, so to shift Bitcoin to a green secure protocol. Once this war erupts, bitcoin becomes the cyber pyramids, where visitors ooh aah over the amount of dirty electricity it took ... as we ooh aah over the slave labour required for building those pyramids.

When the legacy financial system goes bust, will the world's nuclear reactors overheat due to neglect, and then go kabooooom ?
Bitcoin's nuclear winter.

Gold is manipulated via paper derivatives. I would prefer with whatevers the current most expensive painting. 
i.e. Leonadrdo's Salvator Mundi. ($45.3m).
1 Bitcoin = 0.00008388 SM

The US requires a large military, so they can protect their global currency, and so continue being the global bully. 
The US dollar is going to continue to increase in value as it cannibalises economic vitality from every other economy. Those thinking this crypto bear market is near an end. Slap yourself hard across the face. 
Unless the rest of the world exits into crypto, we are going to have to wait a few years before the US crashes and burns and then head for new ATHs

I don't understand your connection.
Bitcoin has miners and electricity cost, along side the moral cost of assisting the collapsing of the global food chain via climate collapse.
Fiat printing isn't the same as warmongering costs, because entrapped tax slaves fund the perpetual war cycle. 
Fiat printing is paid via the theft of purchasing power of all those currently holding the currency.

Proof of credit. A modular blockchain. The one I'm gambling on is irrelevant.
Now will you admit, The bitcoin community will never be able to get the miners to strand their mining assets, so will fall behind once PoW is made illegal, so to save humanity from extinction. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:25:27
Bitcoin can't adopt PoS, or a similar protocol, because bitcoin's like one of the dinosaur species after the extinction level asteroid hit, it can not adapt to fast changing conditions fast enough. The Segwit War, as dividing, was a minor war compared to the coming Protocol War.  
Repeat. PoW Bitcoin is a luxury blockchain, with a massive ecological destroying footprint. 
Change the protocol, or gamble on which green blockchain will be first to overtake it.

I suspect the plan for replacing the US dollar as global currency is to digitise gold and settle physically every so often. Under this scenario, bitcoin could struggle.

Bitcoin mining has a carbon footprint. Be it the fossil fuel required to create the electricity, the elements required to build miners, the transport footprint from shipping miners. 
Pretending Bitcoin is an arms length from it's carbon footprint is unproductive.
The big question is ... is the extinction of humanity of a lesser importance to the luxury of sustaining a PoW bitcoin blockchain.
Surely a green blockchain, that operates on a secure PoS or similar protocol, and the longterm survival of humanity, is the better outcome.
