Dude, are you for real? I have no words to describe how great is this thing that you're planning to do. I hope more people come forward and take such initiatives. I too hope to make good gains and donate to the needy.

Don't donate much to Khan Academy. They get a lot of donation as such. Donate it to charities that don't get much donations. Please. No offense to Khan academy, they do brilliant work.

Thank you for everything you've done, mate. I hope the day I become rich, I have the balls to do what you did.

Bitconnect is an obvious scam. Never ever invest in that SCAM.
