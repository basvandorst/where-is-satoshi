The pill analogy is not very good. Beacuse all the value in a given blockchain is in the users and how decentralized it is. Not in the actual "tech".

Okey so show me how i can verify currency wealth without a third party and with no trust factor. And show me every purchase or trade in us dollars history, as usd and btc are the same

You cant just post staments like that and expect people to listen. Where did 50% come from, your arse?
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:14:28
1/36, really? So by your numbers the total currecy cap is 9,4 trillion... Bitcoin is not like any currency by default, the blockchain system makes it unique. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:45:37
I thought you were talking about transactions as in store/online purchases with bitcoin.

In developing countries, not really
In the hands of people with intent to make only profits, not really. In my country im only allowed to withdraw ~1200$ per week. Fuck banks
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:07:47
Not really, hence its an international currency its baciscally competing against all other currencies combined. So its a really really small value cap
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:23:16
Bitcoin is volatile for a reason tho. Look at how small the value cap is compared to any other currency. If bitcoin starts to accumulate large parts of wealth the volatility will be less. Fighting corruption is hard when money is power

I think blockchain.info has an api, you might get wallet balance from there
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:21:31
What happens if people stop using US dollar or euro. It loses value
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:30:58
I agree with you, bitcoin is really fragile in its current state. But i think the monetary system needs to move into the digital age and be more transparent

into the deepfryer it goes
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:04:09
You got that sauce bro?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:18:24
Got it in att 3.9k. should of bought more!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:31
 
is says their having some minor performance issues

Something that I still don't understand about bitcoin is how the ledger nodes, know about the other nodes. Is there a central node that has all the nodes ip's like a DNS? Any response is appreciated!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:31
still down for me
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:16:08
You have software for this. For example you have people using search engines without knowing http protocol, socket etc..
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:26:30
It also went from 3-4k to 20k in less than 3 months so it's works both ways.
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:47:11
Yeah, i agree with you. I just find it kind of funny and sad that people WITHIN the tech communites just dissmiss crypto currencies like it's trash and a waste of energy
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:51:49
This isn't even bad compared to what Bitcoin has survived in the past.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:23:59
Btc does have a use case, do you honestly think btc has the value it does today just by fluke? It doesn't make any sense. When more people adopt it and it's easier to purchase with it will stop being this volitile
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:47:23
how much did you spend on electricity?
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:58:37
I've noticed that many people in tech really have a grudge against bitcoin and the whole crypto currency idea. The comments are wishful thinking that it all goes to hell and it's good riddance when the market drops. Why do you guys think this is? Is crypto currencies just a scam and the underlying tech is not that impressive?
