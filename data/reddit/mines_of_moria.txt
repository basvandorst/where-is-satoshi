Noo...the problem isn't that he said shithouse. Foul language isn't needed but it's not a big deal. The issue is he said that he doesn't want immigrants from bad countries (names a bunch of african countries) but he does want them from Norway, the whitest country ever. It's barely veiled racism. It's really stupid to dictate immigration policy based on race rather than a MUCH BETTER series of metrics. That's the whole disgusting root of the issue that keeps getting overshadowned by the fact that he called haiti a shithole. Again the problem isn't that he called haiti a shithole per se, that's crude but haiti really is a third would country, no? It's that he basically said lets not take immigrants from shitty black countries lets take them from successful northern european countries.

past performance. It's near it's all time high and had an amazing 2017 where it exploded. People expect it to repeat. 
The coin has a use beyond currency. It's still has use as a storage of value if it holds/grows well. It's also a source of strong speculation. There are also software updates that will help the blockchain scale. This includes shit like the lightning network, which may or may not take off and be a solution.
I think your general idea about fee's being too high to make it of use as a currency or a bartering unit for small amounts of money is true but that's still only a small portion of the picture and as you saw....it was like that a year ago but that didn't prevent the price from exploding.
The real answer is nobody knows why its going up or down. Tons of variables and market manipulation by whales and investment bankers. It's not reasonable for you to expect trading volume to reduce. It's been going up by a ton. The thing is, most trades are on exchange platforms.

No, it's members of both sides that are refusing. The reason you saw some democrats vote for it was mostly because they were given the okay to do so given they knew the bill would fail anyway because it gives them cover if they live in super pro republican states. 
Really, it's the hard right of the republican party that is preventing a bipartisan agreement between the rest of the republican party and the democratic minority. They have trumps ear and trump keeps blowing up bipartisan agreements. He's backtracking and not honoring his word, what a SHOCK. 


It would happen soon, March I believe. 
The republicans defunded childrens health insurance (CHIP) and trump ended DACA (deferred immigration status for kids that came over illegally) so they could use them as bargaining chips. Problem is, they want to "bargain" by attempting to blackmail the democrats to get every single hard right fantasy passed. It's not going to work and they think they can get everyone to believe somehow its the democrats fault even though they are the minority. It won't work, people aren't that stupid. Oh wait, yes they are but hopefully reason will prevail. 
The government can be funded independent of any decisions on CHIP and an immigration deal but time is quickly running out and politicians are understandably getting sick and tired of punting the issue closer and closer to the deadline. Again, it's republicans using these issues as bargaining chips. These are peoples lives! hundreds of thousands of people will be deported and kids will literally die and they are doing that for a political wish list involving extreme cutbacks in immigration and fully funding that ridiculously impractical idea of a wall. Sigh. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:51:57
It's not debatable that there is a far right contingent who has the most stringent immigration desires. How is it "following the law" to want to reduce legal immigration by 50%?

the usd is inflationary, meaning its worth less year over year because we print more. its been increased since 08 IIRC due to QED. the budget isnt a perfect doc, it needs changed. if we want to spend the same that we did last year we need to spend more this year to do so because money is worth less.

Agreed. I am terrible at statistics. Why can't you apply a trendline to a log scale? He didn't provide any details on what the trendline is derived from so I just assumed it was autogenerated by R or excel or something.

I was thinking that a linear trendline could be viewed as being derived by percentage growth rather than absolute figures and perhaps is still useful to look at in the sense that it would give you an idea of the direction of the graph. A logarithmic trendline on the absolute data would be interesting as well, I wonder what the R^2 value would be. 
I'm confused why my post is being downvoted, I was trying to have a legitimate discussion. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:41:49


I already replied to you but this isn't true so you shouldn't keep repeating it. They need 60 votes to pass the budget. There are &gt; 50 republicans. There are 100 senators. This wasn't a party line vote. 5 voted against that were R and 5 voted for that were D. That's 11 short (mccain didn't vote b/c he is dying). Really this is the republicans being unable to reconcile with the fact that they can't reconcile the differences between the unrelenting demands of the hard right and the unwillingness of democrats to acquiesce given the republicans hold the house/senate/presidency and will take the blame. They have shown a legitimate desire to reach a bipartisan agreement. So have many republicans. The problem is they can't deal with Trump because he changes his mind depending on who he talked to last, doesn't understand the legislation, contradicts himself, and has childish tantrums that are not befitting of the office and scuttle deals over and over again.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:58:26
Is it hard for you to read? Took me no time.
fees have been high for a while because the network is often congested. It's basically under heavy load, think of your computer having 100+ programs running and the resources being utilized at 100%.
Secondly, no transactions arent normally that expensive. It's possible to move coins around for far far less. You can move them into an alt coin (ethereum, etc) and those are faster/cheaper due to less load and possibly design. You can also use GDAX which will cover many of your fees. It's the same back end as coinbase.
Finally, that wallet you chose is probably hot garbage. Pick something else.

red is sell orders green is buy. x axis is price. So, more to the right is x+1, so the farther right the higher the price. Of course X-1 is to the left which is price decrease. The left side is all the buy orders that exist on the order book and the right side is red and is all the sell orders on the order book. It's a visual. You ask what is a wall? Well the Y axis can be thought of as depth, or the number of orders at a given price. a "wall" is a high depth. Basically over the past few days someone (or a bunch of people/institutions) have been throwing up a big "wall" at around 17,250. Like 1200 coins worth. The order is a limit order which means it's someone who is saying i will sell 1200 coins and each one needs to be at 17,250. The current price is at or below this. The middle point of the buy and sell orders is the current price. As orders are filled the middle point moves. If there are more buyers than sellers and they are willing to offer enough the mid point moves to the right. If it's going to move to the right past a sell wall, the entire depth of the order at that price needs to be purchased first. I believe in this particular instance it started going down, there were a number of 200 bitcoin buys that instantly chopped away, and then he cancelled the rest of the order before it was totally eaten and it looked likely that he placed it higher, at 18,002. All conjecture I didn't see this happen on gdax but it was reported here in threads.
hope that's helpful!

I'm trying to look into the fee's now.
A few days ago I got BCH from coinbase:
+0.0249918 BCH
≈ $39.98
I moved the BCH to GDAX and then moved it from gdax to binance. 
BCH in binance after transfer: 0.0249918
txid: [4a340d5b4295c50ae838811d66729242905117d9d7c78bbc8265d83070cfd4f0]( 
I then did a BCH/BTC swap. Completed 2017-12-20 16:09:43. BTC in binance: 0.00480159 
txid: [fa20b4e68f1a2709b68893d1f7eade3e2f6a8ee44253aaa31e56a428a4ea6d42]( 
I then sent this BTC to my wallet on coinbase. 
+0.00480159 BTC
≈ $79.73
Transaction can be found in here: [link](
It didn't take long at all. Certainly less than a day. I think my BCH hit binance after a few hours? Maybe 1 hour. BTC hit coinbase really fast. I got the BTC in coinbase at 12/20/2017 4:14 PM according to the timestamp. So at most it took 2 hours if I did it immediately. 
I wonder how much I did pay in fee's...I recall there being a fee at some point. Probably when I did the bch/btc swap. 
Order history in binance:
2017-12-20 16:07:49	BCC/BTC	Sell	0.221121	0.024	0.00000531 BTC	0.00530690 BTC

How often are journalists really just people writing a random blog or op-ed or post or whatever rather than a legitimate journalist?
And even still, anecdotally, reading an article a journalist produced about a subject you have deep knowledge of (like me and programming, or my wife a nurse and nurse related stuff) illuminates their misunderstanding and bluster. 
The lesson i've taken is to be deeply skeptical of EVERYTHING you read and try to rely on evidence over the words of another. When it comes to bitcoin I try to actually look at the order books on the exchanges, google trends data....real data points. FWIW.

If WW3 occurs currency as a symbolic means of trade will collapse and be replaced by barter because society will fundamentally break. WW3 would involve a cataclysm. Nukes are bad, and they would fuckkkkkkkk up the environment. Worldwide famine, global trade breakdown, etc etc. Roaving bands of savages looking to rape and plunder won't give a crap about gold.
Let's all hope WW3 never happens because nukes means we all lose big time.  Read "The Road" by  Cormac McCarthy.

we currently *are* neutral, so of course no blocking or packet prioritizing is occurring (or it shouldn't be and courts can make companies stop from doing so). the fcc is saying isp's should be allowed to do so and nobody can say otherwise. net neutrality == neutral playing field. repealing == no longer level.
isp's have violated net neutrality before. remember a few years ago how they throttled youtube and netflix? that was bullshit. now that's going to be business as usual. the only reason to be for removing net neutrality is if you work for a company like comcast or verizon. they're going to make so much money. you a d i, and almost everyone else will be worse off.

So...you're in favor of what Pai is doing? Hell no. I don't agree with you whatsoever. I think you're confused....the concept of net neutrality keeps the network equal. Data is not given higher or lower priority. What is being proposed is that data priority will be 1) allowed and 2) federal law overrules local law, so states and municipalities can't decide on their own to persist with neutrality. 
It's a bullshit money grab by corporations and will fuck up the internet.

I disagree. What will really happen is a competitor to netflix will now face an increased barrier to entry. They won't have the same advantages that companies used to have. Now they have to somehow deal with the fact that netflix (or whatever the entrenched company is) has preferred status with ISP's and other companies across the network stack and they can't get the same treatment without massive capital, which they can't get. It chokes growth and will result in diminished growth of what the internet could be. We will all pay more and get less over time. They will do it gradually enough where people won't freak out until it's far too late. Data caps are coming. So is paying more to use services that work fine right now.

Oh sorry man, I took your post as a critique at my post not the one I was replying to. 
I see what you mean now I think in regards to taking it seriously. This is really massive amounts of money though, I think it's interesting to watch how the market is being manipulated and how the exchanges work. I have a very superficial understanding, it would be interesting as hell to learn more about how the exchanges and blockchain are programmed. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:37:21
i didn't say how to rebalance though. maybe just adjust when you buy or whatever. rebalancing would be good to reap rewards when bubbles occur, no? cash out into something stable. it goes down, buy back in.

In fact i'll give you a stego program written in C. Basic stuff really, it's not doing any complicated. Hides letters in the first bits of an image. Also includes a program to decrypt an image. Would be up to you to adapt it as you see fit. I'll tell you right now a program I wrote in a day as a sophmore will compile but is certainly not secure. 
You can make more complex ideas, stego is really awesome. In the end obsfucation is not necessarily perfect security so beware. You aren't necessarily as safe as you think. Best to use airgapped computers and make a paper wallet.

Coinbase is fine, if you plan on holding long term transfer to a paper wallet. Everything has risk. I.e. you don't really have to worry about hardware failure with coinbase but you do need to worry about them being hacked or your account being hacked. I actually was looking in the coinbase settings recently and you can see a lot of details about when and where you tried to access your account. Within the last 30 days I had at least 4 attempts from 4 different countries where people tried and failed to access my account to drain the funds. If you hold your funds in a paper wallet that's not an issue. If you hold in your own software/hardware wallet you don't have to worry about coinbase failing. However you'd have full responsibility and who knows when hardware will fail or software bugs will cause issues. 
Bonus is if you hold in your own wallet you can benefit from things like bcash and segwit2x. Negative is you can mess up in a variety of ways. Do you trust yourself more than the engineering team at coinbase?

Would you consider any cloud service safe? I.e. could you simply use a micro instance of EC2? 
fwiw if I was storing more than a few dollars I would have done something else. I simply thought dropbox was more likely to be online than my HDD in 5+ years given I reformat usually every year or two for one reason or another. It's also true that they literally log every line of text you store on their platform but I would still be absolutely astounded if that ended up being compromised. If you're storing so many that you need to worry about that level of risk you would invest in your own hardware dedicated to bitcoin plus multiple levels of redundancy + physical redundancy. It's simply a question of your level of acceptable risk. I'd store on coinbase before storing solely on my mobile phone.

it was 10 cents worth of coins. I could just as easily have taken the key and encrypted it. More about storing the data on a platform that won't go down when the hardware fails.

I didn't use a printer....i just saved a screenshot of the important info and stored it in dropbox.

I hardly have enough room on my desktop, I had to delete almost everything. 
I didn't have much to store away so I wasn't too worried....it was more of an experiment. If I was storing substantial money I would probably spread it around via multiple wallets and maybe multiple platforms too, that way I wouldn't have a single point of failure.

Make sense, but conversely words have specific interpretations based on their definitions and when you're talking about something exact like software security words like always and never carry connotations that may require more clarity in word choice. I don't think a person has to be autistic to require that level of clarity with something like this, IMO. I mean, we are trying to specifically discuss the nuances of cryptocoin storage security....seems to me like this is the kinda topic that could easily get technical and probably should when making claims.

You can transfer it somewhere else if you want to. This could be to another wallet hosted by a website, or to a software program running on your pc or smartphone, or to a hardware wallet. You can always put the coins back in coinbase and sell them at that time. Taking them off of an exchange doesnt change their value or freeze their value or anything. The price fluctuation is the amount of usd to btc. It's not like your bitcoins themselves are growing and the ratio of btc to usd is stable.

again it's not that simple. How do you evaluate merit? These are complex issues without simple one sentence answers.

huh? i was saying his comment didn't say anything of value. you can infer that RT is propaganda without relying on any american media. its a simple and obvious conclusion to anyone who does a bit of their own research with an open and analytical mindset.

This is a man who had a meltdown when he realized how much money he could have made if he held and waited instead of liquidating for a small profit. Now he only gives a shit about reaching the highs that he could have if he held and decided to go all in to see if he can make it happen again but this time for real. I hope it works out but it's a phenomenal risk, that's for sure. I sure hope he is hardcore about securing his coins.

no don't bother
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:26:11
No no I didn't mean you were a moron. In fact I suspected you were right. What I wanted was a analysis that involves math, not my level of analysis which was "it went up a whole lot recently, so it will probably go down....and then if it keeps doing what it's been doing over the past 1+ year it will inevitably climb to new heights to buy right after a price spike if you think it's a sizable dip b/c a larger spike will come sooner or later." It's just guessing and getting lucky rather than a real analysis.

You know why....you didn't have the disposable income to make the investment. At least, that's why I didn't. Hard to justify it when it would cost your entire bank account. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:53:24
Not sure where you are from...but you can go to coinbase.com. set up an account. buy coins. let them hold them or transfer them to the wallet application of your choice. 
If you're buying to try and sell in any short time period, that's probably not a good idea. Also this is an all time high so this is probably not the idea time to buy....but who knows. A lot of money laundering happens through bitcoin, so I know in the past chinese moving money out of the country has boosted the price temporarily, as has manipulations to do pump and dump schemes. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:45:40
I was going to invest 6k in bitcoin, instead I took the gf now wife on a road trip across the country for the summer. Was it worth it? Yeah I'd say so. This was back in 2011. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:01:43
there is a site where you can buy bitcoins for cash. i would only invest if you really believed in it and wanted to not touch it for 10+ years.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:47:26
enough where you dont really give a shit about money anymore? i hope so, i suspect that bitcoin made a lot of people absurdly wealthy. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:57:34
Do you think it still makes sense to buy a bunch of BTC and hold for 5+ years? I was thinking about going on coinbase and starting a recurring buy but haven't executed yet. 
Also curious, how do you store your coins? Paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:41:50
how many coins do you currently retain back from 2011? Or I could say, back before coins were worth &gt; $100
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:02:40


fuck! you caught onto my plan. might want to make sure your wife can recover it, would be a shame if you suddenly passed away and your coins were locked away in storage forever. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:52:37
Do you keep your bitcoin holdings a secret from your family and those close to you? Did you cash out at all during any of the big price spikes?
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:32:22
1 byte is equal to 8 bits. So it goes, from small to big, byte, kbyte, mbyte, gbyte, tbyte, pbyte, and so on. Each time you go to a new word you increase by 1,000. So 8 bytes is (8 * 8 * 1,000,000 mbits)

and some message saying it was broken if you bet above a certain amount.
I was looking at the source code and I saw the images were hosted on imgur. odd, right? And they are only 1 day old. And look at that URL. and look at some of the bitcoin address history. Fucking scam artist piece of shit.

There has been no change even after letting it sit for many many hours and rescanning it via another commenters suggestion. Got any ideas? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:04:29
Woah, what? So I can't get it anymore if I delete the app? Does it still work fine?

Well, he WAS at paypal, so what does he matter to paypal today? Is he still on the board or something? Anyway, I still don't see why ebay would ever allow bitcoin to be accepted because it would screw over paypal which is their golden goose. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:10:59
rescanning actually only took me about 15 minutes. Maybe my block chain just isn't that big yet? Or maybe my SSD really made the process quick. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:10:22
Most of the day. I'll let it do it's thing tonight and will report back if this continues. I have a fast internet connection and great hardware for what it's worth.

I'm getting a little frustrated. I have very little cmd line experience. I know the location of bitcoin (C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe) but when I try to go to that folder in the cmd line it doesn't work. Help? I'm sure the issue is me not understanding how to navigate the command line interface. 
edit: oh, you have to type in cd then the directory you want to go to. I think it's rescanning, thanks!

The most important thing you can do, really, is get a backup power supply for your PC. You might be in a world of shit if you suddenly lose power at the wrong time.
