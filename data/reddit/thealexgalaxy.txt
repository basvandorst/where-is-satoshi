Forging steel into a car required great energy in R&amp;D, testing, and manufacturing, so I don't think energy is created there.
When you destroy a car the scarcity of other cars increases, so monetary energy moves to other cars.

The fact that today’s money is created by powerful authorities is the greatest systematic injustice in the world today and the root cause of growing inequality.
Brewer conflates ‘hoarding wealth’ and ‘hoarding money’ but these are different acts. If people are hungry, then hoarding food is evil. If people are sick, then hoarding medicine is evil. But if one dude had 95% of the money in the world, taking it and divvying it up to everyone in the world might create more problems than it solves — I certainly don’t believe it would result in more food or medicine.
Financial privacy has both good and bad repercussions but honestly it’s not really worth debating because bitcoin provides it to everyone and bitcoin can’t be stopped. 
Hiding money in offshore accounts/shell companies shouldn’t be illegal — it should be well-publicized as stupid. Bitcoin not only offers tax-free savings without the admin cost and risks, it offers tax-free inheritance too: give half your password to your heir, and send them the other half when you die via Google’s Inactive Account Manager (a.k.a. deadman’s switch.))
While bitcoin is new and scary and currently concentrated in the hands of few, it is great news for equality, because it points to a future in which the authorities can no longer create debt-based money at the expense of the poor.

I realize this is a common theory, but it is false. Merchants and buyers, and employers and employees are essentially free to agree on prices and wages. When a money becomes more precious, (which **was** the case for most of the history during which gold and silver were money,) prices and wages fall i.e deflation happens, but the economy would not slow down. Think about the converse situation: if the authorities decided to print and distribute $100 to every American, would this action spur the production of more cars, the building of more homes, or the growth of more food? No, the economy would not grow - the preciousness of money would simply decrease. 
In fact, it's totally reasonable that an injection of new money would actually slow the economy: in order to rediscover the balance between supply and demand, energy would need to be directed to discovering new prices. If new prices were not discovered, shortages of goods and labour would occur. The energy spent on price discovery would otherwise be spent on creating real wealth, like cars or houses.
I'm glad I seem informed:) I took a couple classes in economics but my degree in Engineering Physics. Most of my ideas came through self-directed reading. Biology, and especially ecology, have a lot in common with economics: both deal with complex systems in many ways beyond our ability to comprehend. I think the messages of Fred Pearce and many Libertarians are both expressed at a [high-level by Michael Huemer in his essay "In Praise of Passivity"](

I suppose it's possible that the parallels are just a coincidence. My reply to (top comment above) adds further evidence to the idea that moneys are life-like things. IMO, this makes it eve less likely that the parallels are just a coincidence.
Is fiat money poisonous? I use it everyday and if I had to lug around gold and silver and assay and measure every coin and make change in copper pennies it would be a royal pain in the ass. Fiat is the best money the world can realistically use today. Bitcoin's code isn't ready to allow it to work as a worldwide money.  However, fiat has some massive flaws. IMO, its biggest flaw stems from the network effects that throned the US dollar as the world's pre-eminent money. The production of new US dollars is done at no cost by powerful americans. This means that, on average, money flows out of the US and **real wealth** flows out of every other country, *into* the US. This includes natural resources like oil and fish, and wealth created through human labour. IMO this is the worlds most gross injustice. Thankfully, it will be end when bitcoin goes to the moon.

Eating food is not the *reason* humans increase order, it's more like the *pre-requisite*. IMO, bitcoin is analogous: it *needs* to consume electricity in order to hash and stay alive... and by staying alive bitcoin can create order (in the form of a immutable digital ledger.)  
Hidalgo says, "All life forms are computers that ingest physical order and generate physical order." His book is about people and cities so his statement is understandably narrow. In truth, life can ingest and generate many forms of order. For example plant-life ingest *light*, a form of electro-magnetic order.
Regarding "Trust": Yes, it seems like semantics. Maybe we should call dollars a 'suspicionfull' network.

I got the idea that the US can print more money, per capita, per year, than smaller countries by imagining a world with two countries: Country A has 100 people using 100k units of money a and country B has 10 people using 10k units of money b. The business network in country B sucks - only 9 other people have money b to buy things. A desire for a larger market pushes merchants in B to accept 'money a.' 
On the other hand, people in Country A are hesitant to accept 'money b,' which, to them, is obscure, possibly counterfeit, and anyway, where would they spend it? (It would be accepting a Kenyan shilling in Milwaukee.)
 
So, the flow of 'money a' from country A into country B would be large and the flow of money b into A would be small. With 'money a' leaving country A, the scarcity and preciousness of 'money a' would have to increase. The authorities would be left with two choices: 1. do nothing - and wait for prices and wages to be cut (deflation) or 2. print more money, which is basically free. They choose the latter. 
Fiat money isn't exactly power, but it has the ability to buy power. So merely because country A is bigger, it gets to make money faster per capita without devaluing its money. 
When it comes down to it, it's all about network effects.

And third, bitcoin creates a global trust-based society, giving each individual the right to contribute to economic development for all.

Remediation is the removal of pollutants. Bitcoin has often been compared to mushrooms, which tend to grow in and rejuvenate poop, dead things, and toxic waste. If you haven't seen this [video]( by Paul Stammets, you'd love it. 
Biogenesis is the emergence of life. While silver (and gold) always existed, it suddenly became animated a couple thousand years ago. Small pieces started moving around world in growing currents. It would be a stretch to say silver was 'alive,' but it was definitely more life-like than other metals. Silver's code is simple: 47 protons and 47 neutrons.  Its 'metabolism' was human hands and feet.  Silver is robust, but it has (as far as I know of) no feedback loops that made it antifragile.
On the other hand, bitcoin has a feedback loop that makes it antifragile: mining difficulty adjusts in order to maintain a predictable and confidence-inspiring one-confirmation-per-ten-minute 'heartbeat'. Bitcoin's metabolism is massive. It's powered by coal, hydro, nuclear, wind, solar, and probably more. Finally, bitcoin's code, written in C++ (?), is complex. 
One could say both silver and bitcoin experienced biogenesis, but comparing silver to bitcoin would be like comparing a virus to a chimpanzee.

I don't think there's a dichotomy to be made between speculators and financial experts. We all have knowledge, many of us are willing to speculate, and we can do so on the futures markets and/or through binary options. I would expect that binary options priced at $5 (or 50%)  generally line up with futures contracts, thereby making them redundant. The synergy comes with binary options that have a price of $0 to $4 or $6 to 10. These contracts, in combination with futures for the same date, give us a second dimension with which we can get a sense of the price on that future date.

Your statement might be true in some cases. But some banks, i.e. "central banks" actually make money because the government gave them a license to create new money. This is the source of all new US dollars, euros, yens, etc. and it is a process independent of the creation of new wealth.

"What's interesting here is that these attacks are ongoing globally against banks themselves," Kaspersky Lab expert Kurt Baumgartner told Ars.

I see. Your method spends to an address that is derived from your file, but your file's hash isn't actually on the blockchain. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) 
So, to prove existence, would you recreate your address with your hash at bitaddress, and then point to the address on the blockchain?

I think total energy could also be estimated with another method: If we assume mining profits approach zero, then the energy used in the last 10 minutes is 25 bitcoin ÷ the current price of energy (in bitcoins/Joule). 
I think total energy would also equal the "block-integral" of block rewards divided by the estimated price of energy at each reward in bitcoins/Joule
Energy = ∫(bitcoins/block)÷(bitcoins/Joule)
Not sure if this is harder or easier to estimate!

Ok you've got me thinking.  I agree with you but which commodity? Oil? Copper? Transistors? A joule is the best commodity for measuring the value of bitcoin because 1. it's fungible and 2. it's the simplest, most common desirable.  Where I live in Canada a satoshi gets you ~250 Joules (I converted from from $CAN0.08/kWh.) 
On second thought I think this is probably the way we'll measure the value of bitcoin in the future. 
That being said, I'm sure there would be value in graphing the total energy eaten by bitcoin (teebb.)

IMO it's inevitable that faith in traditional money will crash. The only question is when. When that happens the price of bitcoin or whatever is the new money will increase asymptotically against the USD, euro, etc., but the value of one bitcoin will continue to fluctuate and will never buy you an infinite number of any commodity. We'll measure the value of a bitcoin against a commodity or possibly basket of commodities. IMO we'll probably use energy.

Right, and if we want to measure the worthiness of money then we need a metric. Since legacy moneys are doomed in the long run, I suggest we use energy, as measured in Joules. It has a real cost and it will always be valued.

Am I miscalculating somewhere or is your guess way off?
power = hashrate x efficiency
          = 50GH/s x 0.16 J/GH 
          = 8 J/s or 8 Watts
energy = power x time
           =  8 W x 48 hours
           = 384 W*h
           
cost = energy x rate
       = 0.384 kW * 0.1 $/ kWh 
       = $0.04

Most of the vendors I've seen on localbitcoins charge 3% or more, so I bet most buyers are first time buyers getting in for the long hodl.

I just found that reading stuff on Medium.com requires a VPN in China. So here is the text:  
The enthalpy of fusion is the heat required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid or a liquid to a gas.
Most people underestimate the enthalpy of fusion with respect to the energy required to increase a substance’s temperature. However, consider the following: the energy required to melt a kg of ice is 333 kJ. The same amount of energy could be also be used to heat a kg of water from 10°C to 90°C. (Read about how that can be calculated here.)
Despite the constant addition of energy during the melting process, the temperature remains constant. This makes the addition of energy hard to observe.
I believe money is similar.
Most people’s monetary state of mind accepts dollars/rupees/pesos: a messy combination of central database money combined with paper notes and coins. Others have transitioned to a monetary state that accepts bitcoin: a decentral database money backed by proof-of-work.
It was very difficult for early adopters to change their a monetary state of mind; they consumed a great deal of energy studying software, economics, monetary history, and philosophy. While they consumed that energy, the price of bitcoin did not change. It did not change when they convinced themselves that bitcoin was secure and not a scam. It did not change when they had accepted a certain level of certainty about the future of money. It only changed were they took their dollars/rupees/euros and traded them for bitcoin. A monetary phase shift is a pre-requisite for a price increase.
As bitcoin continues to go up in value, as more educational and entertaining content is created, and as governments continue to diminish the integrity of flag moneys, the enthalpy of fusion from $/₹/€ to ₿ decreases. In other words, it is getting easier for people to change their monetary states.
I suspect that the total energy that humans are transferring to the monetary battery we call ‘money’ is growing steadily and exponentially. Bitcoin is just one type of money. The price of bitcoin increases in spurts as successive cohorts achieve enthalpy of fusion.
I stand by my prediction of a $12 million bitcoin in 2019. We can’t measure the amount of energy going towards changing people’s monetary state of minds. But it is certain that many of us are at the melting point. Once phase change occurs, the change in temperature will be more rapid than most of us estimate.

People are always going to want more energy, whether it takes the form of food, transportation, ocean front property, dollars, or bitcoin.

There are a [variety of ways]( to define and measure inequality. A simple one compares the wealth of the top 20% to the bottom 20% of a given population. 
You might not care about inequality, but many do; it has been Bernie Sanders' main issue. It's weird that you want to bet on my motivations for forwarding certain arguments. Only I can say what my motivations are. 
Many people are mistrustful of bitcoin because they think mass adoption will lead to massive wealth for early adopters and therefore inequality. These people ignore or don't understand that new traditional money is created for free in perpetuity, by authorities who mainly reside in the USA. When dollars are exported from the USA, real wealth (lumber, gold, labor, etc.) is imported from another (poorer) country, thus increasing inequality. Even when dollars are loaned to a regular American, he or she must spend energy to repay the loan, thus increasing inequality.
As an aside, in a bitcoin future the issuance of loans will be much less common than it is today because the ability to create money in that process will be lost. Fewer loans will mean fewer people with negative wealth.

All living things need energy to survive, so to say, "all value is subjective," including the value of food, is stretching the truth, imo. I would argue that energy is the most objective form of wealth. Any tool that can be used to harness energy is also an objective form of wealth, from a car to a vacuum to the bitcoin machine itself. The price of these things is determined in a subjective way, but to me it is clear they have fundamental value.
Since dollars can be traded for energy, I think of them as virtual energy. The fact that bitcoin are literally created from energy (and time) make them an even more-real kind of virtual energy.

The upcoming election has given me an excuse to knock on my neighbours’ doors in East Vancouver and ask them what they care about. The answers are wide ranging: childcare, jobs, pensions, affordable housing, global warming, and speed limits that are too slow.
I’ve met over a hundred people and I’m amazed at how nice everyone is. Almost everybody is happy to sign my nomination form to run as an independent candidate … even if they’re a Trudeau fanatic or life-long NDPer.
I’ve been slowly evolving my pitch. Here it is, roughly:
“I taught high school for four years, have a degree in engineering, and work experience at two software companies.
A few years ago I heard about this internet money, called bitcoin. I was skeptical, so I researched: how many bitcoin are created? Who gets new ones? The answers are actually quite clear.
But when I ask the same questions about Canadian dollars, it’s a different story. It seems like nobody knows how many dollars exist, how many will be created in the future, or who receives new dollars. I think this is strange. By running for parliament I’m hoping to bring awareness to this, and other issues.
What’s important to you?”

Interesting info, but I'm still unclear on the meaning of "one dollar"  in the time of circulating silver and gold coins. Was it a mostly-silver-coin-slightly-less-than-an-ounce imprinted with "One Dollar" on it? 
"the price of silver [was] $1.16 an ounce in 1890, and $0.6 in 1895."
What was the price of gold in those years?

["The U.S. dollar is commodity money of silver as enacted by the Coinage Act of 1792 which determined the dollar to be 24.1 g pure  silver."]( 
By 1900, paper dollars were much more common than silver dollars. This is when the [The Gold Standard Act]( was passed, which assigned an ounce of gold as 20.67 paper dollars. The paper dollars were broken promises for 24.1 g of silver.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:50:16
Why do you think they had the gold standard all that time? You might be right, but I assume they were on a silver standard or at least a hybrid silver-gold standard. 
I do know that the word dollar comes from 'thaler,' which was a common silver coin. This [US gold coin from 1924]( is in many ways on the silver standard, as it is worth 20 silver "dollars".

But the way I figure it is this: 6 blocks an hour for 24 hours = 144 blocks a day
if the hash power were to split 49-51, then one chain would mine 
0.49x144= 70.56
0.51x144= 73.44
That's less than 3 blocks ahead a day

Bitcoin rekindled my libertarian beliefs, which emerged in college but withered in the years since graduating. They were simply too exhausting to maintain in a society that believes otherwise.
Before bitcoin I thought the cause of the problem (government coercion) was widespread socialistic beliefs. But bitcoin pushed me to look at dollars, which I had never questioned before.  I learned that the dollar-centric system is both the main source of government power and the main cause of inequality. The system of dollars creates an environment that fosters socialistic beliefs, which then results in increasing government coercion.
Bitcoin gives me hope for a freer and better world with less war and more kite surfing.

Dollars foster inequality because their production, distribution, and (to some extent) transmission is controlled by those in power. Thus, the powerful become more powerful and inequality increases. 
The existence of inequality encourages all people to support redistribution of wealth, which is a socialistic policy.

Yes, I like this idea that futures markets can yield a probability distribution of the price of bitcoin at various dates in the future. The thing I'm struggling with is exactly *how* to determine the probabilities of that distribution. I think the difficulty is made clear in the following example:
Let's say a futures market is selling contracts that say the price bitcoin will double by Dec 31 for 5m฿. The payout is 10m฿. With a payout of 2X it appears the probability of bitcoin doubling by Dec 31 is 50%. 
But the payout from a "dollar-perspective" is *at least 4X.* (Someone buys y bitcoin with 10 dollars, buys the contract, wins 2y bitcoin, and sells those bitcoin for *at least* 40 dollars). So now it looks more like the probability of doubling is 1/4 or 25%.
Curious what you guys think about this conundrum.

Cool thinking!
Although the numbers in the example are problematic. With a 1MB cap it is extremely unlikely (impossible?) that all transactions in the queue will get mined and therefore there will never be 0 available transaction fee "units." Likewise, it would be extremely unlikely for a miner to be able to mine 100/105 available units.
Is anybody aware of a graph of total tx fees in the mempool over time?

There was no text on the specific transactions, like "pending" "unconfirmed tx" that would have warned me.

Others like bitcoin because it has never funded a war. Never. Not even one *little* war. As far as I know, bitcoin is responsible for *zero* deaths.  Jesus would have loved this stat!
I don't believe Jesus hated currency traders. Why do you say that?

Thanks for reading?
1. You don't have to be rich to be a bitcoiner.
2. You can't pay tax in bitcoin yet, but you can still be a bitcoiner and pay tax
3. Bitcoin is accepted in by merchants in every country around the world, thereby eliminating the need for currency exchangers.

There are snapshots of the info TD provided me about a quarter way through [my first article](
Why did I assume "deposit $2200" referred to cash? Because cahs is what the fraudster said he was depositing. I rarely use cheques anymore but am aware that TD online banking has dozens of transaction descriptions. If a cheque was deposited I would have assumed it would be indicated as such.


I never wanted to be a politician. I wanted to raise awareness about what I consider to be the  **biggest** issue in the world today: how traditional money is created. It's what keeps rich nations rich and poor nations poor and rich people rich and poor people poor. It's what funds wars and borders. Bitcoin has potential to bring a lot of harmony to the world.

I agree with your sentiment on Hearn. He just **said** he sold to lower the price and get more cheap coins. And XT was a good idea, on the surface. Justolfi on the other hand deserves a spot. No one has worked harder than this man to come up with more improper spellings of bitcoin.

GREAT POST!! I agree and empathize. People's inability to make the leap is frustrating, but I think it's testament to how deeply money is imbedded in our psyches. People view dollars the way Luther viewed religion: they see problems but can't fathom a revolution. Instead they advocate reform.

Great article. Not sure I'm following the logic of this passage tho:

I suppose it depends on the jurisdiction you live in. I have the go-ahead from the Canadian Fincen, called 'Fintrac' to do bitcoin-Canadian dollar transactions.

It seems like you two are debating in a triangle of bitcoin, energy, and USD. If we imagine a future in which there's been a collective loss-of-faith in USD the facts are clear. In that era, the best metric we'll have for measuring the 'price' of a bitcoin will be some unit of energy. We'll say, "Today a bitcoin is worth X gigawatt-hours." If energy becomes plentiful and cheap then more of it will be consumed by mining. In terms of gigawatt-hours, production cost will increase, and so will 'price' because as Satoshi, Marx, and Smith all said: prices approach costs.

I've noticed that the USD-cross price of bitcoin is regularly higher in the UK than it is in Canada. I wonder if this is due to more buy pressure from bitcoin believers or if there are more miners in Canada who are selling out. Whatever the reason, there is a marketprice in every country, and the more you trade, the more accurately you'll know what it is.

In this video I agree with Robert Shiller and Kaushik Basu that stock options can be a camouflaged ponzi scheme and I show how this is so.  I disagree with their belief that the feedback loops that have increased the valuation of housing,  gold, and bitcoin have anything to do with Ponzi schemes. On the contrary, I explain how the high valuations of those things is beneficial for everyone.

'Buying bitcoins' implies bitcoins aren't money. 
'Selling dollars' implies dollars aren't money (and also that they're overvalued.)

Not sure what country you live in, but Greenspan said it's 9% per year in the US (for M2), which is also 8 years to double. However, I have a hard time believing that Canada can create as much money as the US and maintain a relatively stable currency. I mean so many US dollars leave the country of origin and continue to circulate.
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:58:18
Gotcha. Maybe it would more clear as: "As people get richer they tend to spend more." 
I don't think there's a limit to the growth of the value of money tho. As long as our ability to harness energy continues to increase, along with our aggregate desire to save wealth for the future, the value of a bitcoin, in terms of how much energy it can buy, should also continue to grow. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:18:08
Yes, that's exactly what I meant. Glad we agree :) 
(Although how anything can grow or change without a change in time is beyond me!)

I'm pretty sure that if "depositors all demanded their money at once" banks would just create enough money to satisfy that demand. We're not talking about something that is scarce, like gold or bitcoin.

So a Central Bank says, "We're lending Bank X $1 billion at 1% interest." 
It creates $1 billion and lends it to Bank X.
Bank X gains the use of 1 billion (for a year) and incurs a cost of 0.01 billion in interest.
Central Bank incurs the cost of accounting, say 0.01 billion, and gets 1.01 billion in a year. 
Is that about right, in your opinion?
