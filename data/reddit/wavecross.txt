This isn't a semantic argument though. It's the difference between taking something from someone and they no longer have that physical thing versus making a perfect copy that doesn't damage the original the actual owner had and then using that. They still lose money because now you don't need the thing they were going to sell you, but it's all opportunity cost, not ACTUAL lost inventory. 
Stop trying to call semantics, when it's a fundamental difference.

I feel like you're not arguing against his point of it being copying instead of stealing. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:40:58
Want to give specific examples instead of just saying it's bad?
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:37:25
Those are valid concerns, thanks.

Did the receipt have 2000 on it?

Guy got away with lots of btc, people are using silk road 2.0 and alternatives.

I was thinking about his mix of american and British spellings. Never learned English outside of the U.S. though

For the short term, sure. Long term it's just too volatile. Even then, I  wouldn't have all my investments/savings in just one currency. Diversify and stabilize.

Ehh, mediocrely insightful.

This is basically why I installed noscript, ghostery and adblock on my windows machine, along with MSE and malwarebytes. All of this plus a 27 character gmail password, with variations for all my other accounts. It happens gradually, but I feel pretty secure (and I don't even really own bitcoins). 
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:52:05
I'm arguing with your for belief then. I'm saying what if in 15 years btc is worthless because there's a better option. If you diversify, individual failure isn't a calamity. Also, I would trust the history of certain assets to trust my investment. Btc has no history and I don't feel safe staking what is essentially the second half of my life on something with no reliable long term history.

I mean, it's saying they're not going to stay relatively constant, something is going to happen

I believe it's close to $1000, and building up rep so people actually buy from you is difficult too.

Pretty ingenious on DPR's part for negotiating a 500,000 ransom to 150,000 while making sure the guy knew he wouldn't hesitate to kill him, although he could've just gotten played. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:29:51
What is this? 
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:04:07
I think it's going to drop again soon when most people realize what has happened. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:43:42
Or alternatively, a moto G at that same price point. If you can spend a little bit more, the nexus 5 and moto x are good off contract options for around $350

I don't understand how Bitcoin could be independent if none of the prices are in it and it's just used as a transfer medium.
@_date: 2013-06-16 06:49:21
Do we know satoshi is japanese? His writing on the forums suggest he could be canadian or possibly british because of his odd use of adjectives and words in general, although it's all up in the air.

So it's like any other limited commodity, but it's much easier to use for bartering (although it's technically just buying and selling). I know what you mean, it's just an odd idea to think about with everyone talking about the magic of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:49:11
What I think is that DPR was simply negotiating the price of the ransom down a lot, also scaring the guy with the measures he was willing to take. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 18:13:47
Do you really think they're not causing any problems? They're processing withdraws manually, that's absurd. Seriously, if people's well being are dependent on BTC, you should plan a little better.

Just order legit stuff like t shirts and art from it.

Do you have to pay for a membership to localbitcoins, or are the  coins just more money?
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:31:20
But it does if you're being actively sought by the United States government because you're running a $1bil plus online black market.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:36:31
I mean don't put your retirement in BTC. If you just want to put some small amount in it for some short term money. It's volatile, but we can sorta predict it's going to keep rising for at least a couple more days, so short term it's more predictable. No one knows where BTC is going in 25 years, which is long term for investment.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:49:37
Please tell me that you have more than bitcoin as savings
