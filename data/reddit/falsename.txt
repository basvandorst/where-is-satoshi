[link from the actual source, done by James Corbett of The Corbett Report](
Also, a link of him [talking about bitcoin](
I love this man, couldn't recommend listening to his podcasts highly enough.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:43:06
I highly doubt that.
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:12:39
...and you could trade it for something cheaper than a ferrari, normally lambos...
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:02:31
that makes a ton of sense, thank you
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:24:07
I'm surprised that I was mistaken the whole time... I knew about bitcoin in 2010 but I've never bought any, what I liked the most was that it ""was supposed to be anonymous"" I thought everything was encrypted, everything.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:10:01
wasn't bitcoin supposed to be anonymous? in my city there is a bitcoin ATM... I wanted to buy some but the machine wants to know FUCKING EVERYTHING about you. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:27:41
who is 4chan?
@_date: 2019-03-05 07:15:00
here is the source. It's in Spanish, I don't have time to translate it now... but it says pretty much what the article says.
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:36:35
I feel the same way
@_date: 2019-03-05 00:23:23
hey man! it would be nice if you edit/tag your post as Solved and how you did it... so next time someone is in your situation they can solve it themselves without having to dive into the comments... just an idea!
Happy to see you got access to your coins, welcome to the rollercoaster.
@_date: 2019-11-24 09:58:47
where does paper wallet fit here?
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:56:39
funny thing is... one weekend sounds about right to me.
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:33:18
he didn't have any bitcoin until last year... what are you even talking about?
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:39:06
IIRC he said he wasn't a btc millionaire, as everybody would expect being in the space for so long... and the reason is because he was using it as a medium of exchange, he was earning and spending btc, rather than hodling.
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:29:09
I'm tired of this guy, everytime I watch his videos I have to buy more.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:20:11


yes, he does
@_date: 2019-04-14 07:49:17
bitcoin.de won't ask for your ID if you spend less than 2500 EUR. And you can buy with SEPA transfer
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:59:34
this sir, is probably one of the best comments I've read on this issue.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:19:19
I wouldn't laugh at the chinese. 
They can ban bitcoin for the 13th time
@_date: 2019-01-30 23:29:31
I think he is talking about his youtube channel, which is called "aantonop"
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:22:49
try to send me 5 dollars from wherever you live to me, here in Brazil... let's see how much of these 5 dollars I get.
Also, why would I choose to use a bank if we can transfer value between us with no middle-man? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:52:11
@_date: 2019-01-30 23:11:53
probably bad... and then good

now you only need silver, guns and bullets.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:57:15
thank you, we need people like you.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:03:37
I don't think BTC is ready for mainstream adoption. We WILL get there, but it's not here yet, we aren't ready. 
If I have to guess I would say less than 1% of the population is playing with BTC. We need a bit of time before that crisis comes along. 
Other than that, I fully agree with you
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:05:44
You sir just made me think... normally everything involving biometrics scares the shit out of me, but... somehow... applied to bitcoin it doesn't. Bear with me here:
I believe one of the slogans the establishment will use against bitcoin as we grow as a community and go mainstream is that it's not safe, not the technology itself, but the people using it... (stories on the media about people losing/forgetting keys, phising sites, scams... you name it). I recently watched a video of Antonopoulos where he said something like, "somebody will try to be the middle-man with bitcoin so you would have the feeling of being safe... I don't want safe, I want free".
While I agree that we are in the early stages of an amazing technology, it won't go easy on people if safety is an issue, even remotely. This is not just like the internet, this is actual money. You never had the feeling that you might "lose something" when you go to the internet, but a lot of people will be told that if they get into bitcoin, they could lose whatever they put in.
Back to my point... would biometrics somehow help to secure/validate your keys in case of total loss? I've never thought of that. 
Don't be rude with me, I haven't procesed what I've just said yet, I'm thinking out loud here...
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:53:33
on one hand I'm disappointed, on the other hand I just think his opinion is mere anecdotal, note he talked about cryptocurrencies as a whole.
Also, drugs, tax evasion bla bla...
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:02:55
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:23:03
I like this very much. well done.

[here my friend]( 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:35:26
hey man, thanks for this. Almost cried there.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:09:40
I wonder how much personal data they want from you when buying it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:15:50
I've bought at the same price as you... "knowing" it would go down but fearing it would go "way up". One think I learnt here is "you only lose if you sell", meaning... if price is lower than you've bought it for you may have to wait till it goes back up. If you are prone to panic try not to check the price right after you bought it, though I do that myself every. single. time.
In all honesty, I'm quite confident it will go up to 10000 soon... and stay there for few weeks, meaning.... BUY AGAIN.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:09
I just bought some for the first time, though I knew about the existance of BTC since 2011, (I know). He is currently at 0.1% of having to eat his own dick. As a new hodler, I'm going check this website to have a quick view of how my investment is going. Thanks OP.

to be fair, the article doesn't say much more than the meme
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:04:35
It was killed by one of the Pantera Capital's hodlers.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:39:25
you sure of that?????
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:59:54
thank for posting this, it's the best thing I've seen in a while
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:48:38
so... if BTC gets illegalised... bye, bye?
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:56:48
If it becomes a real threat... I'm sure it will be illegalised, my question was what would be the consequences... and so far gave me the one that makes more sense to me.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:15:31
haha!! Its not the only one I accept... (actually I was hoping to hear the opposite) I would accept anything that makes sense, people are comparing it with drugs, but for me its not the same at all.
I was hoping to read a good reason to believe that BTC's value is "unbreakable", not just the maths behind it. Otherwise I think that BTC ecosystem will grow up until it gets dangerous for "the system"
Still hoping to hear good reasons though
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:05:57
it's not the same, money doesn't have value itself, drugs does.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:53:30
thanks?? this is the answer I was afraid to read.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:45:16
sadly you have to compare it's value with something else until it gets the biggest currency. Fuck the dollar, I know, I agree. I'm just trying to think if its possible a big change in the world's currency without going through the mother of all wars.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:19:55
thanks for the correction!
Still... don't you think the value would go down to hell since you can get catched just for using them? the other day I learnt that it's not completely anonymous unless you have an anonymous internet connection. I wouldn't compare it to drugs... I buy drugs to take them, not to trade with them, I could buy some cheap drugs in my country and make huge profit selling it a few kilometers from here, but I don't do it because it's fucking illegal.
I don't know... drugs are "valuable" because people get high, if it were only used as a currency it would't have much value...
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:28:52
Illegal to accept bitcoins... illegal to exchange bitcoins/dollars, someone here said (dunno if its true)


what if coinbase were illegal?
The architecture of BTC will always be there, but can it be worthless?
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:39:25
how does this tipping thing work?
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:31:04
people breaks the law... ok
nobody is gonna shut the internet down because of BTC... ok
BTC value would be based on people's trust... right? all currencies are based on trust. I just think that people's trust wouldn't be the same if BTC is declared illegal, plus, which kind of companies would be in charge of the exchange?
I'm not talking about BTC arquitecture... which I think is amazing, my doubts are related to people's trust.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:22:17
how would be the exchange afterwards? chinese or russian companies buying your dollars? I'm quite curious
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:27:56
that's why I'm only hodling for now. 
In the future price will go up as more and more people start buying crypto, for that I believe we need a crisis... a big one, somewhere. I'm talking about what happend in Argentina few years ago, or Venezuela now (though Venezuela's situation is different). Or an even bigger crisis like in 2008. 
All these crisis make things happen, like people questioning about their government/banks, inflation, people tend to spread awareness about how the system works as a whole (I've seen this myself during the crisis in Spain). Bitcoin will represent an alternative when the next big crisis comes, we didn't have it last time.
As for now, I'm buying as much as I can.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:47:48
and thanks to internet, the develop of EVERYTHING is getting faster exponentially... so just try to imagine how it's going to be in 19 years from now.
@_date: 2013-10-14 10:54:32
I wonder how real is going to be sex with all this stuff... and some futuristic japanese hardware device involved..
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:35:42
alcohol and drugs have the value of getting you high, if that is scarce the value rises, I know. But this is money, and you need lots of people using them to make them valuable. The supply would be the same since nobody can erase bitcoins, the demand would drop because people are afraid of trading with something illegal.
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:19:50
why would they bother to "break" the network if they can just make it worthless?
the question now is... ¿would it be worthless if it's illegal?
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:20:43
oh, thank you, I thought that I needed to travel all over the continent to buy drugs
