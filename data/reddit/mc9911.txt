There's currently 225k unconfirmed transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:49:24
I second this
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:35:13
How can you tell who's a man or woman in here?
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:17:36
Why don't you buy some now? And don't regret it again in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:25:46
Curious as well
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:19:35
Hey you think you can help me boost mine? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:42:40
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:12:41
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:11:31
I see 167k
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:30:34
1+ hr?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:32:44
My tuition fees are much more than $300. I don't think this is the place for this tbh. But good luck
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:54:39
I don't get it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:04:48
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:03:32
Look into r/btc so you can listen to both sides. So the argument won't be one sided. Some prefer btc, some prefer bch. And no I'm not trying to bring btc down by suggesting to listen to both sides. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:01:28
It's all the coin I had
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:16:14
Why are those post removed?
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:08:36
I'm suggestion to look on the other side because both can be one sided. That way he can form an opinion on bch rather than one place to tell him about bch. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:19:11
What was the question?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:31:57
I did a transaction with $12 fee. Took a lil over 6 hrs to send. That's sad
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:27:58
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:37:06
Could be your bank
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:16:36
Try it
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:16:49
It sent me 4 transaction. 0.00, 1.00, 1.49, 1.34. They're asking for the .49, and .34 ones. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:08:10
Yeah but what if it goes lower and lower. Idk if I should wait for that dip. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:44:43
Well the order never went through and it's still pending in your bank account. When something like that happened to me before and I called the bank and they told me that if the order never went through, then you will see that pending go away in 2-3 business days. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:28:46
Everyone says it's a scam
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:40:40
I am. But I'm fairly new to this whole bitcoin thing. I just bought some 2 days ago. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:36:01
My guess is that it will go away after 2-3 days. Because it's pending doesn't mean it'll go through.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:37:01
But it from Amazon. I bought my trezor there and it's available. I saw the nano was available as well
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:59:25
Another question, I have a trezor coming in a few days, how do I go about transferring the Bitcoin from coinbase to trezor? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:04:11
Do you know how much the fees would be?
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:46:52
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:35:18
What's your private keys? I'll try to hack it
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:31:22
Does this count?
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:18:31
Fork me?
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:47:53
Yeah but what if it's more expensive at that time?
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:22:55
Nobody knows. Goodbye
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:54:45
It can raise at any second. It can also go down at any second. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:11:28
It's dipping, let it dip
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:29:46
It's still pending so it didn't go through yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:53:14
Why btc over bch?
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:40:40
What was the point of this?
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:12:52
Couldn't see it on mobile, will try again on PC tomorrow. Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:52:57
Is it okay it I keep my Bitcoin in coinbase for at least 3 days?
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:18:41
Tried to buy. Internet went down. Went up 50 during that time.
