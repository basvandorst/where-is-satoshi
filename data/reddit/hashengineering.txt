I forked a thin client which is the Bitcoin Wallet android app by Andreas Schildbach for Namecoin.  It requires the use of the "headers" message and it was able to sync with the Namecoin network with the current code base.  The app I made has no knowledge of any domain names.

I will try to fix this later today.

Yes, it definitely presents a challenge.  The Bitcoin Wallet is able to process transactions, even though it does not store the blockchain on the device, but rather gets the headers and uses Bloom Filters (but doesn't have to) to get the transactions.  Namecoin seems to store the naming service information in the transactions, so an SPV namecoin wallet could submit the transactions.  But it may not be able to query those transactions from other nodes to determine if they are confirmed in the blockchain the same way it can query for spending transactions.

We might be able to add some namecoin specific features.  Need to do more research.

The app doesn't support domains.

based on my most recent fix, the Nexus 7 and 5 should work according to Google Play.

I posted an update that should hopefully resolve compatibility issues.  While many reasons for this were thought to be permissions related, it seems it was related to native library support.

Install it using the GitHub link.  Hopefully recent fixes with Google Play will fix compatibility issues.

I am not sure why Google Play is reporting "Not compatable with your device".  I get the same problem on my Nexus 7, though I am able to install the app manually throught the GitHub link.
