Sorry also with this one I disagree.
1. YouTube is a privat platform that we are as consumers are choosing and YouTube is providing a service with this platform. Therefor it is their policies which are to be followed and implemented. If you disagree with these policies (if they are good or bad depend on the point of view) than you can or have to choose a different platform or build your own. Censorship as you call it is something that is happening a dictatorships or democracies and is usually introduces by governments of similar institutions. However a privat company os free to display what ever they like (in accordance with the law). 
In addition the blockchain will not solve any of these issues and bitcoin as a usage of a specific blockchain even less.
2. Agree with the data collection. However you are free to choose which kind of data you want to publish. Same goes for the blockchain. What every you want to be stored in the blockchain will be stored. However it can never be removed. So we need to be even more carful.
3. For transferring money? Well with Europe I bay 0 fees. Internationally that’s is however different. Therefore i agree a digital currency is a good use case. However this does not necessarily need to be on the blockchain. Banks could do that now as well if they wanted to.
So to sum it up. I’m a big fan of the blockchain and digital currencies such as bitcoin. 
But please let us stop with the arguments which can not be sustained when taking a closer look.

The Blockchain is not giving you anything back. Let’s be honest, it’s just a distributed database requiring no trust if it is run by a number of parties. Therefore it will not solve any of the problems raised in your post.
