And Bitcoin is not expensive? Lol. Virtual internet money is really worth $100B? I don't think you're qualified to say what is expensive and what is not.
FYI, there are other stocks besides APPL, GOOGL, NTFX, etc... There are also abundant lesser known, undervalued companies. You also have the stock options market, which has tremendous potential at any stage of the market cycle. 
Bitcoin makes sense to you because it's simple. Equity markets are complicated, and that's what makes them amazing

I think you underestimate how much money big banks have, or have access to.

Don't worry, in 5 years you will all know the meaning of a dead cat bounce. And maybe, just maybe, that will be the time to buy.

So, we going to $2500 now?

I've been investing in the stock market for about 7 years. Judging fully from the chart, this is what TA analysts would call the start of a "dead cat bounce". 
Considering the lack of fundamental value that usually keeps assets afloat, I see no reason why BTC is worth $5000, $2500, or even $500. I'm guessing it slides down to $1500+ for a few years before the next boom. Hopefully for holders BTC will be more established by then and the next boom can be sustained.

I think we could go as low as $1000 or a bit under. This is where there will probably be large resistance. Remember, bitcoin's value is all in our imaginations. There is nothing tangible backing the value, so there is no reason that it should have support at these levels.

You used to be able to buy 10 BTC for less than $5, and nothing material has changed since then.

All fair arguments, I would just like to point out that for 1 bitcoin, you could buy over 800 loaves of bread. And at its peak, over 4000 loaves of bread.
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:15:46
The 21m limit on Bitcoin kind of becomes irrelevant once you learn that you can buy fractions of coins. There is essentially no limit.

Supply and demand. If there are 100 people wanting to buy a loaf of bread, but only 10 loaves, a bidding war could start and the price could rise.
If the shopkeeper instead says, I'm going to cut each loaf into 10 pieces so that everyone can have bread..that's great. But now there is no reason for a bidding war and the price should stay flat.
This is what is happening with Bitcoin. There is an infinite supply, so the so called "scarcity" is a void argument. 
Unlike with bread, Bitcoin has no actual value. Bread can be used for sustanance, and also goes nice with butter or jam. With a single loaf, you can experience this goodness 12 times. With Bitcoin, whether you have a full coin, or just a partial coin, you are still a chump.
