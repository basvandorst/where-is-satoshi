Majority of sellers out, majority of potential buyers waiting for consolidation confirm before buying in. Alternatively people are scared as shit and are looking for the next asset class to speculate on.

Supply and demand determine price, not value. Bitcoin was as valuable early December as it is now, however the price was almost twice what it is now. Value is harder to determine as it is subjective. If people don't understand the tech then their perception of Bitcoins value will be different from someone who does understand it. The usefulness of bitcoin to society will determine its value, the volume of buy orders vs sell orders will determine its price. 
Edit: Bitcoin is actually probably more valuable now than in Dec but I was trying to make a point.

Lol you know you did something stupid when you become an instant meme. That "16 year old" must be cringing everytime he goes online.

The China ban on ICOs and exchanges had a far worse result in terms of % and took a while to recover, we are now at 3 times that value. This is a correction sparked by big players taking profit and little players panic selling in response. Market psychology. The segwit debacle wasn't a correction but a flash crash as market sentiment was still bullish through the event.

The only people who know when to buy are the ones who can move the market with their trades. The rest of us are just guessing, and taking credit where it isn't due. Your guess is as good as mine. Timing the market is a futile pursuit. If you think Bitcoin is worth more that $9000 then buy now.

Warren Buffet is a redditor for 0 days too, just saying, arbitrary rating system you have chosen...

I agree with the other comments. Each buy and sell action is only exponentially adding to your risk. Buy and hold if you believe is the best strategy, like ol' Warren says; investing should be boring (I acknowledge the perceived irony of quoting someone who has spoken out against Bitcoin) but its good advice nonetheless.

There seem to be an awefully large number of 'experts' in this relatively new field of knowledge.
