Decentralize everything! .. except crypto. There can only be one crypto..

It wasn't created for it but the (unintended) implications of crypto leads that way. Think Panama-papers for the 99%. Government can't function in that world.

I really dont understand how a decentralized currency is a means of destroying capitalism. The crypto-world would seem to imply the most raw free market anarcho-capitalism the world could ever see.

The only thing that keeps me sane is the realization that i never had any money to invest either way so whatever.

Why is it illegal? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:29:13
The internet is essential infrastructure for the government and financial institutions at this point, but still net neutrality is under attack.
Bitcoin needs to creep under the radar long enough to make that happen.
Explosive growth will trigger lobbyed knee-jerk reactions. Its a simple political sell. "This black market currency, used to buy drugs and kiddieporn is undermining your pension savings, we must act!"
Remember, 99% of the people just doesnt care.

The echo-chamber is strong. People forget that their incredibly niche reddit board doesn't represent the population as a whole. Most people probably hasn't even heard about bitcoin yet..
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:29:11
Yeah, kind of hard to quatify objective legitimacy without turning into Ayn Rand, not really what they are going for. ;)
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:56:07
Seems to me that the two go hand in hand. When crypto grows in popularity it will inevitably start to shake the foundations of our economic and political structures. The powers that be will then most likely "have" to act.
I think that threshold will be long before the majority of people use it so it will be an easy sell for governments. "This terrorist currency is destabilizing the economy and your pension savings are at risk! Drugs, terrorism, kiddieporn and crime, there is no place for the black market in our socity and this currency is instrumental for bla bla bla!"
That's why i think it is naive to dismiss it like he does, it is inevitable imo.
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:46:10
There are many things to attack. Banks transfering funds to wallets (like with the ban on online pokersites), business being able to accept bitcoin as payment (through taxlaws), ability to trade for the common man (like this move by the russians), end net neutrality and throttle the fuck out of anything remotely to do with the blockchain (not sure about this, just guessing it would work), or just straight up prohibit ISPs to link to bitcoin related sites (happening with torrentsites) Etc.
All this is possible with manipulation of the general public opinion.
Facts are now, always have been and probably always will be second to populist manipulation of the public. 
"Bitcoin is a terrorist, black market money used to buy drugs and kiddieporn and it's creating instability in our financial sector, undermining your pension savings! We must act!"
When a force like this appears the powers that be appropriate it, regulate it and smother it so it doesn't reach critical mass.
Like drugs and torrents i don't think it will vanish from the face of the earth but with what i know now i do think it will be suppressed enough to not have the fantastical benefits most seem to anticipate and even enough to push it into the relative obscurity it resides in today. Really looking for arguments to change my mind though.
But i am pretty sure most nations would sooner kill the internet than let the more optimistic bitcoin-libertarian/crypto-anarchists get their will.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:15:12
There are things fiat currency allows that bitcoin doesn't, asking the people used to this power to stop using it will be.. tricky i suspect. :)

For sure, scary as fuck tbh. The turmoil that comes from the clashing of old and new never seems to be pleasant.
All this on top of automation, quantum computing, global warming etc etc could get pretty weird pretty quick..
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:07:35
Seems incredibly naive imo. Also, the first part is skirting the big argument for bitcoin, that it WILL be big enough to cause concern. What then?
The growth of bitcoin also seem to be so explosive that knee-jerk reactions will be taken to protect the entrenched Financial institutions.
It seems to me pretty easy to outlaw to a large enough extent that the revolutionary aspects of the blockchain never goes mainstream and status quo is maintained.
Outlaw possession, outlaw businesses from accepting payment, outlaw banks to send funds to known wallets like they did with poker.
Sure, they might never fully remove it, but it seems to me that it would be enough to prevent it from reaching critical mass.
Would love to be wrong, but this video did not convince me, please direct me to more sound arguments based maybe more on technical aspects as to why this isnt the case. Please.. i need to be wrong about this..
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:10:10
The problem with bitcoin and blockchain, as i understand it, is that it inhibits projection of power through lack central banking and being able to dilute the moneysupply for political gains.
Someone on here aptly compared it to asking superman nicely to stop using his powers..
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:15:18
Cool, we are basically on the same page in principle.
I might think that the more popular bitcoin becomes the more the entrenched elite will start "fighting back" and i might think that threashold is lower than you. But not a major difference compared to the libertarian arguments i read all over the place.
I do honestly realize the fundamental breakthrough of the blockchain, i just dont put it past peoples reactionary drive and fear of change to do crazy shit to protect their interests and feel the safe glow of the status quo.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:16:59

My argument isn't that it will be removed, just kept in obscurity and mostly with black market applications. Throttleing and manipulating public opinion is enough to maintain the status quo, i think.
My gripe is mostly with the "to the moon!" And extreme libertarian ideas of toppleing the fiat powerstructure.
Do you think governments will be unable to stop that? Before i go further with answering your points, if you say no we don't need to waste that time since that is really the only thing im talking about.
If you say yes however i am very curious as to how, since that is the question i have yet to find any solid arguments to support.
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:55:52
Interesting read, i am a cynic by nature and somewhat new to this so i am largely uninformed but instictively very sceptical about bitcoin mainstreamedness that is positive in the way bitcoiners would like, but would love to be proven wrong.
Doesn't this article make a fundamental error in assuming bitcoin as just another money? It seems to me to be fundamentally different in nature whereas the dinari, dollar and every other fiat had basically everything in common except the head printed on the coin.
Anything that threatens the states (and those that control it) ability to project power is smashed or appropriated for the elite. Whithout having studied this article in depth this seems to be a move towards the latter, no?
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:44:38
Sure they have power and pull, but i honestly think it pales in comparison to the power and pull that wont like this when it goes "to far".
I agree with the last thing there, it wont replace fiat, but if it stays under the radar it might be alowed to go along for the ride.
The hope is that it slowly becomes such an integral part of everyday life that it goes past a point of no return, like the internet. That banning it or impeeding in it will create large blowback, slowly gaining momentum like that.
The worst thing that can happen in my opinion is going straight to the moon to quick.

It will deflate into oblivion. People who are blind on the bitcoin cool-aid talk like deflation is a good thing, it isn't. Bitcoin as a concept has an inevitable expiration date due to people dying, losing coins in bad transactions, lost wallets etc.
Personally i think the encryption will be cracked or there will come an alternative that takes market shares before that becomes an issue, just be vigilant and don't swallow the cool-aid to hard so you are ready to move your money when the time comes.
Nothing lasts forever.

Keeping this video updated with further crashes and keeping it in peoples mind is probably the best thing anyone can do for crypto.

Its not about that, budget donations is a drop in the bucket compared to the economic importance of market forces, its about access to the inner market. EUs economy is much more dynamic as a result. The UK stands alone in the WTO frame work and has to "start over". This will be an immediate "catastrophy" for their market while the EUs just keeps on trucking, alittle bit smaller but with all the infrastructure still standing so to speak.

Doesn't really hurt that bad when you're only investing money you can afford to lose anyway, so why not.
The pain of regret and self-hatred over being a coward and not putting stock behind what you belive in hurts worse than the pain of not consuming the latest luxury goods all the time.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:16:46
Yeah, i see where you are coming from, so to clarify; i am comfortable enough in my own understanding of the tech to be able to think it has fundamentals and value but there are stuff around it that takes it into a more "gambleish" territory for me, where i have to apply a more conservative approach.
For instance: i am absolutely not sure about the receptive nature of concepts this complicated for the general public and also definitely not certain about how governments/established institutions will act if it actually gets "too big" or what they can accomplish if they wanted to act.  I just honestly don't know this, so i can't responsibly go all in. Maybe some people do know and can; more power to them in that case, but i'm not banking more than i can afford to lose on someone elses opinion when i am unsure myself.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:25:57
In my mind this is inevitable, i love how naive people seem to be about this. "It will never happen since its such a small trickle of money" one often linked video claimed. Ok. How about when the trickle grows? How about centralized entities love of symbolic action?
This is an existential threat to all entrenched elites, you better believe they are going to resist it.
The only hope is for the tech to be absolutely decentralized so the only way to stop it would be to literally shut down the internet..
Claiming that people would riot in the streets over making bitcoin illegal is incredibly naive and cool-aidy. Its such an easy political sell to get the common people aboard it. Just cite terrorism, drugs, pedophilia darknet rings and point towards cryptos disruptive properties and how that could influence their pension savings..

I almost perfectly hit the peak.
Did a large overhaul of my finances, set up a budget for myself with specific debit cards linked to specific accounts for food and a whole bunch of things with my savings and payed of alot of credit.
I felt so responsible, smart and grown up when i sold of alot of crap from old hobbies and pushed all that money into crypto. Didn't think about the graphs and just saw it as a long term thing..
Literally the day after i pushed my money in; crypto was kill.

Just so typical and even though i do look at it as a long term hodl investment, that i will be investing into every month regardless of the graphs, i won't lie and say that this wasn't alittle demoralizing.
Not that it's falling per se, more along the lines of why i couldn't have procrastinated this shit one more week like i always do everything and bought the dip by accident. :D

If you feel any way about any investment you are over-invested, diversify man. This ride is one hack or bad policy away from being over. Just based on that you should be careful, never mind the volatility of the market

There is no "Buy crypto Y for crypto X" in their eyes. Just like you can't buy Apple stocks for Microsoft stocks. There has to be a conversion to fiat in the middle there first.
They view it as you bought crypto X for 100 fiat -&gt; Time goes on and X goes up say 10% and now you want to trade for Y -&gt; Sell X for 110 fiat -&gt; Get taxed @ 30% on the 10 fiat profit -&gt; Buy however much of crypto Y you get for your remaining 107 fiat.

Honestly i dont think it matters if it puts bitcoin in a good or bad light. Its hard to really understand when you already know about it, surf on the topic every day and is invested in it to the extent that people are on here; but most people really dont know what it is at all yet. They have no idea.
Even if it paints it as a tool for ISIS to buy fentanyl on the dark web it will get some people googling. And that is always.. i hate to say the meme, but.. good for bitcoin.

If you have heard about it going down, it's most likely already priced in.
