I think it's mainly due to a few reasons. First of all, the US dollar has been strengthening as the government props up the economy. Another major financial scare will likely garner more interest in crypto again as a store of value.
Also, the last year or so saw the introduction of derivatives to the market which made it easier to profit no matter the long term trend. A significant number of early adopters/big players starting realize their gains (whether they planned to reinvest or not) after the all time high, coupled with the mtgox disaster, the trend was naturally downwards making dump and short the most profitable strategy.
Just my opinion for what it's worth as a random bitcoin observer.

You, me, and loads of others I'm sure. Try not to be too hard on yourself in hindsight though. For everyone who has had great success in new markets there are countless others who've lost much. It is a bit depressing though to think about the possibility of currently being extremely wealthy from a small investment from even just last year.
 That being said, it's not too late to invest in my opinion. The total adoption of bitcoin is still pretty low so the potential is there for the value to go much higher.

In my opinion, no it's not. AMD cards have significantly higher hash rates and it's quickly becoming useless to even mine with them (mining difficulty is skyrocketing as more ASICS are going online).
The list doesn't specifically have the 690 but it still gives a good idea of how Nvidia cards compare hash rate wise. The wear and tear on your card would by far outweigh the small amount of bitcoin you would earn. If you care about how long the card lasts you, I wouldn't recommend mining with it.

As the adoption rate and number of places you can spend bitcoin increase this will become a less popular method of expressing it's value.
