Don't see how a donation could be a problem? It's not against their policy right?
I also thought it was a mistake, but they confirmed it when I appealed.

i was wrong, it's for real, lol but it was so stupid to bite and switch like this that I thought someone is trolling :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:57:47
That's a great list! Would be of great help!
Also your second suggestions I like a lot, it really stopts a lot of merchant from adopting it because they dont' realize it's instant actually
Very valuable input!

bittorrent is technology for sharing files
internet picary is one of it's uses, this doesn't make the techonology bad in itself
@_date: 2014-07-24 10:33:33
so, you expect porn, you arrogant prick? :)

ok thank you all for the feedback, the show is a GO
we will be producing the second episode shortly
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:08:58
WOW that's great innovation, I have somehow missed it! Thanks for letting me know.

1. Yes, really. We tried to use a pretty dog but it didn't quite work out :(
2. It's a reputable bitcoin gambling start-up ran by serious people. They stood behind us even when we had nothing to show. Or you have problem with the one armed bandits from the past? That's where the name comes from and I think it's cool referrence.
3. So, what's the big deal here?
4. It's for dummies not for idiots that have been in cave for the last 10 years. 
How you managed to relate this to spam, just boggles my mind. I guess you have your issues. It's ok.
The only part I can agree on is that visuals would help yes. Maybe you can do better one with visuals instead of just shitting on people that are actually trying to do something positive for the ecosystem! :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:22:12
great input thank you guys!
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:05:53
That's good idea, in some of  the videos we will address most popular concerns and bad associations of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:48:37
No, that would be trademark violation, there is term for  that so they would use it.
Your argument is invalid but thank you
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:44:32
it's hard to get responses here :)
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:13:31
it's not that, then it would say copyright violation or something....
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:32:18
we are going to do the intrinsic value one
@_date: 2014-07-23 14:00:55
This is kinda rude isn't it? :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:55:38
but you care enough to reply?
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:14:27
we also like goats :)
@_date: 2014-07-24 10:33:03
@_date: 2014-05-29 06:49:11
yeah maybe you should... and maybe you shouldn't be so ignorant either
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:28:26
Since this video at youtube was removed for unclear violation of their guidelines here it is reuploaded at vimeo. Hope it helps.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:23:30
We got in the wrong direction guys.....
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:03:29
so much hate :)
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:22:01
11 why?
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:26:28
Then why just this video out of 5 is suspended, smart ass?
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:39:45
Ok, what else?
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:52:18
Thats not their fees, since they charge no fees and aslo they don't support atm withdraws, so this troll just took this fee graph from somewhere else and put a title XAPO on top of it and you all believed it.

We just published the second episode of our educational series for bitcoin "Bitcon For Dummies".  In each one we try to bust common myth or misconception about bitcoin.
In this episode we explain why bitcoin is NOT a ponzi. Short, simple and to the point. (well as much as possible)
So, I bet you know someone that at some point told you bitcoin is a Ponzi? Well, send him this video and let us know his response, would be fun :)
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:11:01
it's not suspended for copyright violation
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:14:10
nope, it's suspended for other reasons, click the link
@_date: 2014-07-10 18:32:11
I didn't loggin for couple of days to find 400+ comments! WOW that's an amazing input, thank you so much for it!
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:38:52
It's a great video. Much better than ours. Does that make ours shitty? 
Are they making series trying to answer every possible misconception of bitcoin? If not there is room for us too, even with our shitty videos.
Lol, talk about being supportive and good community.
It's amazing when someone tries to actually make something and all the non-productive people shit on their heads.
I would take constructive critique, but calling this decent video the shittiest ever is just retarded.

So, that girl is not sexy enogh for you? Who are you, Dan Bilzerian?
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:38:57
