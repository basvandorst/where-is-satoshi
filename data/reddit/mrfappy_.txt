You are a savage beast. I would be ashamed about this if I were you.

I hate to say this, I really do.. but the Lee brothers are hard to watch at times, for all the knowledge that is in their heads they both seem to find it hard to get points across easily. 
Along with Amir Taki and Jaron Lukasiewicz they should take a back seat  regarding media appearances. 
Miller on the other hand is a **beast**, but I guess thats his job!

I am only reporting what I have found on twitter 
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:30:45
How dare you call me a liar.
I am reporting a source for you, which looks like it is quite reputable. 
 
It doesnt look like a shill page or anything, and is followed by AndreasMAntonopoulos, Elizabeth Polshey among other prominent names in the community

Couldn't believe my luck when my orders filled this morning :)
There is some serious potential in this stock, Neo &amp; Bee are delivering everything they said they would and running it like professionals which is refreshing in the bitcoin space.

Hey Danny.... I'm coming to collect that car, you owe me 200 btc... you dumped our shares into oblivion in the last 2 weeks of trading.

not sure if serious

Should have told inverters about this instead of lying about the €6 million of his own funds he said he put into the company.
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:27:55
You are fucking crazy I only became aware of MPEx because of you.
You probably still believe this is all MPEx fault instead of Danny.

The most....no no no no..... 
THE MOST IMPORTANT thing in the bitcoin ecosystem is TRUST.
Neo Bee and everything to do with the company are fucked from this aspect and completely tarnished and tainted. 
Its like Gox coming back from the dead.... are you kidding me!! 
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:27:20
He ran off 2 weeks ago, not answering calls or messages from anyone, not Papa G, not Tuur D nor Andreas A....
