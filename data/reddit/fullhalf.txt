LOLLLLLLL every fucking time i read something from bitcoins that reach the front page, some asshole like you says shit like this. oh like everybody who even frequents this sub want to admit it's falling so their investments can tank. ever since the crash from 1000+, you guys have been saying the same shit over and over and it never recovered. fact of the matter is, bitcoin is so easy to manipulate and steal. it has been stolen many times already. online stores will only accept bitcoin because they can take that money and trade it for real cash right away. nobody is ever going to hold on to bitcoin. it can never sustain a high value. bitcoin is only useful for moving money internationally or doing illegal/anonymous trade. why would anyone need bitcoin otherwise when they can just use real currency?

no, i would never touch something that is completely arbitrary. even gambling has statistical proof, bitcoin is completely random. although, when it was 350, i thought it was a bubble and would've cashed out already. it was insane to wait til 1000.

holy shit you are greedy. didn't sell at 1000? jesus christ. how much money were you hoping to make? when investing you need to consider the risk factor. bet less, win less and also lose less. a little bit is better than nothing. it was an obvious bubble at the time. nothing with real value can ever go up that fast. without real value, there is nothing but hysteria.
