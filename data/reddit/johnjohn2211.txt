I can't even download their full blockchain to access my old core wallet.

There will definitely be a psychological effect and more new people would buy Bitcoin instead of alts with a low single token price.

Lol, obviously you weren't around when the internet was still a young network. Web addresses didn't even exist, let alone search engines.
Streaming video was never possible according to many because the protocol wouldn't allow it.
And now here we are with a mature internet that's easy to use for most people.

You can use this website to see all the previous major rises of Bitcoin:
Also, Bitcoin grows like a network and its price has been closely following Metcalfe's law:

So? Early 90s almost no one had heard about the internet. You do understand how software works right? It's constantly being developed and improved and through the network effect more and more people will start to use it.
And the last time Bitcoin crashed it jumped up again. What's your point?

In 2008 normal people were affected because asshole bankers poisoned the worldwide financial system.
That's something very different than people investing money in a speculative asset. No one forced anyone to invest in Bitcoin.
You are quite the simpleton sir. You should stop having an opinion and educate yourself first.

There will be layers on top off the core bitcoin protocol. That's how networks scale. Same thing happened to the internet so that we can now have streaming HD video which was impossible in the 90s.
And you should be ashamed of your last comment. The whole world was screwed over by greedy bankers and their politician slaves. Suicides rose, divorces rose, people lost their pensions, people lost their jobs, there were food riots in the poorest countries on Earth. 
So fuck you for not caring about that and saying "it all recovered so what is your point?"

Go ask people in Venezuela or Zimbabwe what they think of your old-fashioned fiat currency.
And did you forget about what happend in 2008?

Bitcoin seems to represent the birth of a new economic system. 
Bitcoin might be that exception you're talking about.

Doesn't matter if they trade it among themselves, there still is a demand for it so they'll try to get their hands on more Bitcoin. Hence the very high prices for bitcoin on markets where it's hard to get.
And gold is a different beast than Bitcoin. Anyone who can download an app or install software can get into Bitcoin from the comfort of their home. Buying gold is more hassle and then you need to safely store it and you can't really use it in trade.

Oh they see me holdin' brother.

I have a programmer friend who knows a lot more about computers and software than I do, but I couldn't convince him to get some Bitcoin. 
Very disappointing. I wanna take my friends on a nice holiday if the price keeps rising, but at the same time they could have had a good amount of money themselves right now if they had listened.

Could also be to make a test transaction, before making a large transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:30:22
Lol, some douchebag downvoted your positive comment.

For payments Bitcoin is currently not a good option, but luckily there's Litecoin or Dash. Next year, the Lightning network will be implemented so we will return to low fees soon on the Bitcoin network.
For remittances, Bitcoin is still cheaper. I just did a transaction for 10 dollars and got a confirmation straight away. For less than 10 dollars you can still do transactions but you'll have to wait longer. Still more efficient than using Western Union.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:02:04
So you are a top trader and you call Bitcoin's price increase irrational?
Are you even aware of Metcalfe's Law? Do you even know how networks grow? Was Facebook's growth irrational?
The fact of the matter is, Bitcoin is a technology with huge potential and is therefore a great investment. And since there's a cap on the number of Bitcoins, Bitcoin's growth is not irrational. It's simple mathematics.

Maybe you ask people that are "unbanked and under banked". Bitcoin is not about making people from the West rich.
Bitcoin has real value for those who do not have access to banking, which is billions of people. Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are way better to use than Western Union for remittances. It's cheaper and faster.
In Venezuela they have hyperinflation. Guess why bitcoin is now so popular in Venezuela? 
Or maybe you should ask people from Cyprus and Greece what they think about governments and banking institutions doing bail-ins?
Bitcoin solves real world problems. Unfortunately most people are just focused on the price.

Iota is meant for microtransactions. I wouldn't trust that network right now for sending very large amounts.

I have a programmer friend who knows more about hardware and software than I do, but I couldn't convince him to invest in Bitcoin.

Andreas Antonopoulos is actually on the oversight committee for these futures. 
Just listen to his talk and don't listen to the OP:
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:20:43
Wow, respect. That's a lot of work. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:49:56
Does anyone have a link to this video?

Biggest bank heist in history.
