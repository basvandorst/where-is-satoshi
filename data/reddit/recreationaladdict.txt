mining is dead.... POW has failed.
Bitcoin is stuck in a failed concept.

hmmm, not sure. I buy Keys with steam and wait 2 weeks
15% off what i put in
works but is slow.
you can put money into steam with paypal.
paypal&gt;steam&gt; tf2 keys or CS:go keys&gt; into bitskins after 7 days. sell immidietly is super expensive (youll lose 30% of what you put in) or you can wait another week, 14 days total, and its about 15% or so

Skin selling sites such as bitskins allow you to take out money to address in etherium and litecoin.
for example you could buy keys in game on steam in counter strike(not on market, more expensive) then wait 1 week(steam item trade block) and add them to the bitskins site, sell them immidietly or wait another week for them to be instantly tradeable and thus worth more. ( if you sell them after 1 week expect to lose about 25% of what you put into paypal, otherwise if you wait 2 weeks its more like 15%)
you can also add money with paypal directly if you go through some invasive confirmation like sending picture of ID and social media page....
so you have to wait two weeks if you want the best deal(better than virwox) by using that method.
steam can be filled by using paypal.
so paypal&gt;steam&gt;bitskins&gt;litecoin or etherium.
wait 1 or 2 weeks..
only method i know right now.

Bitcoin isn't the internet. There are other cryptos with better functionality and reach.
For Bitcoin to be the internet it needs to be a key player and it's not. Corporations are looking elsewhere.

so where are the revolutionary partnerships that will lead this way?
there's barely any for bitcoin, the big players are looking elsewhere.

well all the mining is done in china, that makes it under chinese control.
they could just send a few teams to these gigantic farms and seize control.
