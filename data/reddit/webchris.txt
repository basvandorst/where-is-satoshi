Great explanation and good info about what to expect going forward. Thanks!

How would it increase the bitcoin price? It would increase the rewards to miners, and if the attack was successful it would slow down transactions. The only way I could see it causing an increase in the price of bitcoin is if you consider the attack buys bitcoin on the market. But if the attacker already had the bitcoin, perhaps was holding them or got them as a result of theft/hack, then it should only negatively affect price, if at all. Negatively because it would move supply from attacker's holdings to miners who are likely selling on the market for profit.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:38:10
Yeah, but the problem is all the services, wallets, etc. that do not let you set a transaction fee. The fee market is difficult when many parties do not have any control over what fee they pay.
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:04:40
Yeah I have purchased btc from Coinbase almost weekly for years. Never had a single problem.
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:43:18
If someone pays with a $5 bill, nobody checks if it is counterfeit because it's highly unlikely someone would counterfeit a bill and try to rip off a merchant for $5. For $20, some merchants check, but most do not. For $100, more merchants check. To me it seems like 0-conf transaction risk is similar to that of counterfeit cash, but more timely to "detect". If someone comes in and spends $20 and uses BTC, most merchants would probably consider that 99% secure. If someone comes in and spends $500+, a merchant might be less accepting of 0-conf, or require some additional information/identification at least.
@_date: 2016-01-03 16:46:15
Shocked to see this on @_date: 2016-01-05 16:59:25
Excellent point. If you can make purchases online and anonymously (giving no shipping information or no other identifying information required) then the risk is substantially greater for the merchant to accept 0-conf.

I'm curious why it is not relevant now. During peak times (mainly stress tests), typical transactions have been delayed numerous hours. I guess it depends on what you think Bitcoin should be used for, but I know many people wait for hours and hours for transactions to confirm. This is usually recommended fees, though that is another problem altogether with educating new users to Bitcoin how fees and transaction complexity works.
I would think larger block sizes would relieve a lot of pressure currently affecting Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:43:01
Well said.

I think the block size problem is delaying the point of mass adoption.

Gold is a worthless shiny metal (to many). Bitcoin actually is useful. Why would we want to give up all the things that give Bitcoin value?
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:00:59
Bitcoin is a scarce asset that can also be easily sent to anyone, anywhere, pseudonymously. Gold is a shiny metal which we have no idea the supply of, and a vast amount is owned by governments around the world who can easily manipulate the supposed value. (btw, if govts go bankrupt, what do you think they will do with their gold reserves?)  It seems the majority of gold's value trickles down from ancient cultures who thought it had value because it was shiny. I put 0 value in gold. I like Bitcoin much better as a hedge against inflation, as well as ability to store money safely away from bank and govt manipulation/control. But, if you take away Bitcoin's usefulness and freedom of market (freedom of users to use it however they want), it seems the value far less, and the asset risk rises greatly. Basically, I want to own what makes the world a better place, the economy more stable, and is being used by millions of people to buy, sell, and trade throughout the world. That's what many of us users want with Bitcoin. But it seems the old guard wants it to stay this store of wealth, while providing little value to the marketplace.
The marketplace is saying we want all these things, and some Bitcoin veterans are putting on the brakes and saying we're not interested and that's not what we want Bitcoin to be.

I deal with a lot of newcomers to Bitcoin. Usually when they send coin to a service that requires confirmations, and then their transaction doesn't make the first block... or the next one... or the next 5... they pretty much decide Bitcoin is not capable of handling more than a tiny community.
Sure, some of this is fee education (which I try to help with), but the ease of these stress tests, and the extreme delays they cause, have all sorts of problems for users.
You don't think services and companies are looking at what is possible and deciding Bitcoin doesn't work for their project because of the block size limitations and ease of attack?
Would you put millions of dollars, or risk your start-up's future on a system that can't scale?
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:12:56
Well, bad checks are still a problem today. It is less common, but many retailers do not know if a check is good. Numbers could be spoofed, ID (which is often not required at local retailers) can be forged, etc.
Bitcoin is immediately verifiable. While double spend is possible, it's a low risk for a retailer (for a majority of transactions). And you can still require the user to give you some identifying information (ID, etc.) if it is a problem. Big chains might do that. But to me, thinking like a retailer (I teach IT to small business owners), I would say accepting bitcoin and verifying transaction with 0 conf would be safer than accepting a check (unless you are confirming from bank account exists, name is accurate, and funds are present). 
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:12:26
Great initiative indeed!
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:32:08
I know there was at least one person running a bot to swipe easy to find brain wallets and return the coin after showing the risk of using brain wallets. Not sure if this was the case here or not though.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:01:25
If you go to Brainwallet.org and leave the passphrase blank, this is the address you get. Looks like someone sent 50 btc to this address today and it was gone within 10 minutes.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:08:50
You would think it would be blank for public/private key if no passphrase was present.
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:10:43
It looks like another 2btc lost to this same address today. People learning some expensive lessons.

The description for the chart says "A chart of the total number of unique bitcoin transactions per day." That would imply it contains all the stress test transactions as well. I know there was some sort of stress test around several of these peaks, so I would say the stress tests certainly contributed to the spikes. However, the overall trend of transactions is up.
And the stress transactions are "real" transactions to Bitcoin. It's real bitcoin moving from address to address, typically paying a fee to do so.
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:10:24
Sorry I guess I didn't go into enough detail. It seems most people's concern with raising caps (for those concerned) is that low or 0 fee transactions will fill up whatever cap we have and cause centralization of the network. What I'm proposing would be a scalable limit based on fee. You could remove the max blocksize, or set it to 8mb, or anything scalable. Instead you would have max allocated limits on varying fee levels. If below recommended fee for transaction, you would be in one of these limits. A spam attack would fill up these limits while allowing the normal and above fee network to continue on fine without full blocks. Free transactions and low priority transactions would receive the same delays they have now, but it wouldn't drag down the entire network and create complex situations like we have now. In theory, most wallets would have their default fee at or above the recommended level, however, you could send free or 0 fee transactions if they were low priority or you otherwise weren't concerned with possible delays.
If miners had higher fee transactions that reached their total blocksize limit (if one existed), they would prioritize those over the low to no fee transactions. But otherwise these would be caps that affect low to no fee transactions.
For example, lets say we raise to 8mb blocks. You could allocate a max size that's a percentage of that for fees below recommended, and maybe another level for 0. This way you wouldn't likely see full blocks of free or low fee transactions as they could only use up a certain percentage of each block. It's like flood control, that only affects those users who are most likely to be the cause of the problems.

If you've been following Gavin for the last few years, I think he's said and done about everything that could be said and done to fix the problem. He's not "in charge" and the community hasn't decided the problem is serious enough to fix, or that a problem exists at all.
If this was his first statement on this issue, I would be just as mad as you. But considering he's been yelling the sky is falling forever now, it's about time to start giving death toll estimates.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:08:49
I'm confused on why this would be difficult, or why someone would pay to get a free spot. This would seem to be a code change that would allow miners to automatically approve a limited amount of free transactions per block, and put limits on various fee levels, to prevent their block from filling up with spam transactions that offer little to no fee, while allowing free and low fee transactions to process at a reasonable speed. You could argue the system works like that now, but this would allow bitcoin to scale at different fee levels, which I would think would be a decent compromise between those who want to keep bitcoin free/low fee easy for everyone and those who are looking out for miners.
I would think miners would want to run code that prioritizes recommended and high fee transactions while discouraging spam attacks and 0 fee or low fee as the norm. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:08:40
The block size limit? That was a temporary fix which he said would be removed. It was not intended to be a noose around the neck of the network steadily tightening as it grew.
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:16:26
No one is arguing that. The blockchain was under spam attack. Now that limit is the attack upon the network, causing increased confirmation times, delays, and a host of other issues. That limit was an emergency fix which Satoshi pointed out should be later removed.
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:42:40
Has anyone proposed having tiered limits on transactions within blocks? Allocate a certain number of mb per block to free transactions, then a larger amount for transactions up to X fee, and scale from there. This way if we increase total block size limit (or remove altogether), it would disincentivize spam attacks and further encourage fees for priority transactions, while keeping Bitcoin usable for anyone.
Forgive me if this has already been proposed.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:16:01
I'm not sure how it would be related. If the Fed decision was affecting the transactions, one would assume that would be caused by an influx of people either buying or selling Bitcoin. If so, the price would have moved significantly up or down. It doesn't seem like trading volume at major exchanges is very high either. So the spike in transactions is not likely related a surge in people buying or selling Bitcoin IMO.

First time tipper, but here's 800 bits for the idea, Biaxalflip  @_date: 2015-03-17 01:27:25
He was likely joking, but yeah $0.10 being the minimum unit of a currency would be no big deal. The US has steadily been trying to phase out the penny (taking us to a .05 for cash minimum). I think Canada has already done that. If that day ever came (where each BTC was worth $10 mil), which would likely be well into the future, you could certainly deal with it any number of ways. There have been discussions already, but its so far down the road it seems futile to debate too heavily. If Bitcoin was worth $10mil each, the market cap of Bitcoin would be $210 trillion USD. Those are problems I would love for us to be facing.

Congrats on your winnings. Looks like you've had a great run. There is some great advice on here as far as how to safely store it. I would add a word of caution about gambling. I love gambling, and do it often. However, it can be addictive. And probably worse than losing while gambling... is winning! It can give some of us false confidence and convince us we have some winning strategy. The fact that you pulled winnings out without losing it all shows you have stronger will than many. But it is worth saying that gambling can give, and it can take it all back. So best of luck to you!

Yes, I will try to do that. Though I doubt I would be adding much to the community as I'm no expert. I feel good teaching those who have never heard of Bitcoin, or have very little knowledge of it. It's great to open people's minds to the potential.

Thank you. Yeah I understand that Blockchain.info is just one site that displays data from the actual blockchain. I just didn't know about the change addresses, and couldn't find that anywhere. I didn't know if the site was pulling in data from something else or if that was the actual data, but now I understand. My tech classes are pretty basic, and not related to Bitcoin. But I do like to throw it in and I want to encourage people to get involved or at least pay more attention to what is going on in the space.

Absolutely. Everyone here is either walking on eggshells, or they just give up and move onto other places. Bitcoin was many things, but maybe best of all, it was a community. Now its a bunch of splintered groups.

I get so frustrated every time I have to send someone money via Western Union because they think Bitcoin is "too risky". It will take time and these guys will all be using Bitcoin, or at least be more acceptable to it. As the awareness and adoption improves, we will see more and more positive reception.

Interesting thought, I will mention that during my classes! Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:10:22
I agree, though there are people who hate recurring charges as well. When you run subscription-based sites, you will see a percentage of people rather pay more for a one-time charge rather than save and sign-up for a recurring charge, just to cancel within the first month.
Part of the problem is micro-payments don't add any convenience. I talk about some different applications that really are more hypothetical, but do have potential. I love ChangeTip, as it makes it super easy to tip someone once you are on the platform, and it's easy for someone to join to collect a tip. Imagine something like that where you go to the WallStreetJournal and when it shows the article blurb, if it detects you have this platform (something like ChangeTip, but is installed on your PC or as a browser extension) and it just has a button to "Pay x bits ($0.xx) to continue reading". That's just one example obviously, and I'm sure there are tons more. But if I don't have to sign into something, or scan some QR code, copy/paste a key, etc. and its just a button-click, it then adds an element on convenience.

@_date: 2015-03-16 18:21:35
One reason is fees. If you set something like this up with credit card processors, you are looking at 2%~ in fees. Another is trust. Credit card companies have risk levels and you will be putting them in between your automated transactions, which could cause delays and other issues. If you are sending Bitcoin, the recipient will have no trust issues as payment is transferred quickly and acts as a cash transaction that has proof on the blockchain. Using Bitcoin takes out the middle man.
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:28:44
You make good points, and you may or may not be right about the business model in the WSJ example. I could see a debate about it and it would really take some factoring to figure out if you could make it work. Subscriber loss would be a pressure for them, and I'm sure it is. Content seems to be losing value. There's no big incentive for them to implement micropayments now as there is no universally adopted off-chain solution, but they would get the positive press.
There may be other examples though. Perhaps microdonations to charities, sites like Wikipedia, Reddit, etc. Perhaps games, complimenting the freemium model (going ad-free, buying in-game goods and services, etc.). Also, I do strongly believe in Bitcoin powering the Internet of Things (automated payments from machines/applications based on smart services). But yeah it's not like micropayments will replace the existing sales models of major websites.

That's a decent point that gets complicated when fees range based on complexity of the transaction.
