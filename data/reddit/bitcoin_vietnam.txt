The situation is certainly not as clear as you try to describe it.
You can rest assured, that our team reached out to regulating authorities before we actually started operations. These discussions are an ongoing process - unfortunately I am not in the situation to release any of the contents of these discussions in a public forum.
We are all aware, that this is a pioneering project; basically every more or less important media outlet in Vietnam reported on this topic during the last days.
The project has achieved now already its first aim: To start a public discussion in Vietnam on Bitcoin and how to deal with it.
There are various other sites online, where you can trade Bitcoin in Vietnam - without any basic KYC etc. - basically one-man-operations.
Our approach is different: We want to run it as a complete legit business, because we believe that Bitcoin is a huge chance for Vietnam.
We are willing to cooperate and educate the regulators/authorities and media as well as the general public (which is at all stages happening right now as well as over the last weeks already) on Bitcoin in order to avoid misleading legislation.
Some of our team members/partners were involved exactly in the same discussions  in Germany and Israel  already, two of the main hubs for Bitcoin worldwide, so we believe, that we can offer the right experience for these discussions also from an advanced international level.
Our CEO will speak soon at RMIT Saigon on Bitcoin; an interview at VTV is in preparation as well.... - it is time for Vietnam now to come on board.
And yes: It is still possible, that this is all gonna fail and they are going to restrict Bitcoin usage in a very, very restrictive manner. We are pretty aware of this risk.
Still: The same type of business is already running in Israel (and preparations for some parts of this biz are in preparation for the German market as well) - in a complete legitimate way.
Nothing else we are trying to do in Vietnam too.
If you dont try it, you have lost already. 
We hope that Vietnam will join the boat and are all taking a lot efforts to make that possible. But of course we also can't guarantee that it is gonna work out in the end, which would be a pity for Vietnam.
To the critics on the price: It is 6% above Bitstamp on the current broker exchange solution, which is the price for this kind of business.
If you want to compete with a cheaper solution - feel free to do so, competition is a good thing for a healthy market environment.
The upcoming live exchange "VBTC" will offer much lower rates, which should be located in the same range like the other big exchanges on a global level.

Using  his friend does not need to learn anything about Bitcoin - the recipient will just receive the cash either in his/her bank account directly or collects at one of more than 7000 pick-up locations in Vietnam [the latter service is currently only available manually though - but we can make it work on an individual basis; integration into the platform will follow in the coming weeks].
The only person who needs to understand Bitcoin for using this service is the sender.

Over 24h without confirmation; customer paid 0,1mBTC (20-30 sts/byte range) for his transaction.
Customer gets desperate and angry - he wants his money before the weekend.
An overall horrible user experience and a lot of additional customer service effort.
Just one example out of many during the last days.
It hurts the Bitcoin business landscape, it lets Bitcoin users suffer.

Hi Ed,
Dominik from Bitcoin Vietnam here.
First of all: Awesome initiative - and words are not enough to appreciate your continous efforts to make the life of the children at the Go Vap Orphanage at least a bit better.
We also would like to give notice, that we will of course cut down the fees to the net cost price for that transaction by then - and we'll talk to our liquidity providers as well in order to get the best deal for that transaction. It is  naturally out of question, that we will do any profits via this charity campaign.
Furthermore we would be indeed very pleased, if we can help in any way to make this donation campaign a success, since our team feels a strong commitment to on the one side help to make this country a better place for future generations - but as well as take care for the less fortunate in our society. 
I think we have a few contacts as well, which should help to raise the awareness and / or achieve the fundraising goals.
We would be sincerely honoured if we can take part in making this initiative a broad success.
Please feel free to reach out to us via PM or Email (service to discuss this project more in detail, so we can get out the maximum of it.
Best regards and thanks for taking the lead in this campaign,
Dominik (Bitcoin Vietnam)

No, not us - we are dynamically calculating the fees in order to guarantee a seamless payout (we had to increase the fees per order in the last weeks though in order to account for the currently around 200% increased network fees).
He was trying to sell Bitcoin to us (as he usually does) in order to get some fresh fiat into his bank account.
And otherwise: WE know not to spend unconfirmed outputs - the average user on the other hand will just get confused on why suddenly his transactions don't confirm anymore (or only with a long or veeeery long waiting time).
IF one would like to see Bitcoin mass adoption happening - these are things which absolutely kill the user experience. 
The system and applications they use just has to work without putting to much brain power in it.
As said - IF. Some people might argue that Bitcoin is not made for the "common man" and they should rather stay away from pursuing on-chain transactions (and wait until some day somebody offers them an enough dumbed-down layer-2-/ off-chain-solution).
For now he probably is better off to switch back to Paypal or bank wires.
As a Bitcoin Exchange business we are certainly not happy about that.

Cash2vn is a service operated by Bitcoin Vietnam ( - you will probably find more news articles etc. about us if you google for the "mother company".
Please feel free to reach out to us anytime regarding the procedure of the service.
We can send money to any bank account in Vietnam.
We also have a solution in place in case your friend does not have a Vietnamese bank account - so he can pick up cash from any bank in the country just with his passport [it is not integrated yet in the platform - but we can do this manually in this case].
@_date: 2016-03-04 09:06:14
This is correct - the parent tx paid 0,1mBTC too; but was in size (over 2700kb) much larger than a standard transaction.
But: The customer does not care about such technical details. What he cares about is that he is not getting his money which he needs before the weekend - it is quite a horrible user experience.
We can not start to explain to explain the "average nguyen" from the street stuff about bytes per transaction / "fee market" etc. - it becomes at this point just too complicated to use - and why something which worked just fine a month ago, does not work for him now anymore.
If one believes that Bitcoin is not made for end-user adoption (on-chain transactions are only for professionals or specialized business) than it might be okay to disappoint users like this - because he is trying to do something what Bitcoin is not made for (using money on-chain between normal end-users).
If one on the other side one believes that Bitcoin itself should serve as "P2P electronic cash system"... - than the deterioration of the user experience over the last couple of days is indeed quite worrisome.

It might be our ATM ( - the issue at hand is, that currently in Vietnam you are only allowed to sell goods &amp; services for the legal tender of Vietnam - the Vietnam Dong.
Selling your services for foreign currencies is violating the rules... - and while we know, that many services especially in the tourist areas don't care too much about it... - being a Bitcoin company in Vietnam you are under some very special scrutiny :)

In Vietnam [cash2vn]( by [Bitcoin Vietnam]( is offering the most competitive rates - currently 22,800 VND per USD, while the official exchange rate is just 22,515 VND per USD ( see:  ).

Hello Coinosphere,
The issue with Coinmap is, that it is really not very reliable.
Last year, Vietnam had 5 listed business on Coinmap (2 more in Hanoi, 1 more in HCMC) - we checked them all out in person - and none of them were accepting Bitcoin (anymore or ever at all); so we had to let them remove from Coinmap.
Furthermore there are quite a few business where you actually CAN pay in Bitcoin - but they do not accept Bitcoin "officially" via their homepage; it would work on a private basis.
Future.travel has a proper integration via their homepage with some merchant solution - and you can pay now in Bitcoin for flight tickets, hotels, visa, cruises etc..
And since they are the first to accept Bitcoin in a professional way (and not like: The bar owner need to be present with his wallet on his mobile phone and nobody else of the staff has a clue...) - we think that they deserve the title.

Please read my statement above - it is a private person renting out her apartment for BTC; AirBnB-style.
It is not a registered business.
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:29:03
For clarification:
The "guesthouse" you are talking about is a private person, who is renting out her apartment (as done in AirBnB) for BTC; it is not a registered business entity.
Recommended for staying over in Saigon nevertheless - quite a few Bitcoiners made positive experiences there; Hiep is a great person.

Bitcoin is not illegal in Vietnam - some clarification:
It is old news - if you are offering goods/services in Vietnam, you are not supposed to do for anything else apart from VND. Not USD - not Gold - not Bitcoin etc.
When people started pricing &amp; settling Real Estate deals etc. around 2008 (when we had 20% annual inflation here in VN) - SBV made similar announcements in regard to Gold.
Does not make Gold illegal in Vietnam neither.
So it is all status quo - nothing changed.
Reason that SBV came out with this announcement now was that the day before FPT university (FPT is one of the major private Telcos in VN) announced to accept tution fee in Bitcoin.
A marketing stunt which paid off very well - that announcement got covered in all major VN media - and forced SBV to react in regard to how goods/services in VN are to be offered, since they feared similar announcements spreading.
