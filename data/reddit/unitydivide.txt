Yeah that's what I've been hearing - but my question is... why not? 
I mean, they're fully insured. So anything that happens to them shouldn't affect me.
And let's face it - for the amounts I have (&lt;5k) - the most likely scenario for me losing my coin is me forgetting my password or where I put my USB key where I put my wallet.

yeah i had just bought it recently. Hadn't bothered to figure out how to install a wallet on my computer yet but yeah I'll do it now. So basically, just get electrum, create a wallet, pass the bitcoins over from coinbase. 
Then after August 1, I'll be able to use electrum for my btc and another wallet program for my bcc?

why wouldn't there be enough time to withdraw? There's still a couple of days before it happens

I just moved my coins out of coinbase, but it's been in Pending for several hours. Hopefully it'll get confirmed in time, but what happens to those transactions that are still in pending status during the hard fork?

Yeah but what happens to them? Are they lost? Does coinbase sell them?

just to let you know, I've just checked, the transaction is now confirmed. It probably took about 12 hours. So hopefully yours will be done too.
But it is still curious asking the question, what would happen if they were unconfirmed at time of fork? Cause it takes like 6 confirmation to get it "confirmed" officially right? So what if it just wasn't confirmed enough times for it to be confirmed officially, but was confirmed at least once? Would it still get forked?
