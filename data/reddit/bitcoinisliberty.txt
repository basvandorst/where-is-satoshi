So all you did was trade bitcoin and paypal and everything worked fine?
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:57:48
Yup bitcoins. Bitcoins are the "fuel" to run it 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:22:04
You send BTC to a multisig wallet owned by multiple companies. They give you tokens for use on another blockchain. When you are done using the sidechain you mark the tokens for exchange back into BTC. When enough companies ok the transfer you get your BTC back. You skip all speculative value changes that would occur with alt coins. The tokens and bitcoins are pegged 1:1 with each other. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:26:33
LOL. but nervous LOL

Trezor 2.0 is coming FYI. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 18:26:55
You could sent the entire balance to your own address and sign a message with that address. Will cost a transaction fee though.
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:37:59
The most comforting is a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-24 02:25:51
Are they trying to show bitcoin is useless for privacy and needs better mixing? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:27:41
Usually the worst that happens is coinbase etc just closes your account. They won't arrest or charge you. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:32:08
The order would have to be brute forced but definitely not ideal. Keepkey and Ledger S use methods that don't reveal anything.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:08:42
Lot of fake blockchain users or Trezor users like Electrum instead of a chrome plug-in?

Try with CAPS on but still use shift for capitals? Weird. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:12:29
I can't see the vid at the moment but what is the development and how can it help bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:05:07
Lost words would have to be brute forced. The more words to brute for the harder. Only knowing half would be very hard. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:45:47
Perhaps tools written to work with opendime will automatically check the signature with known signatures from opendime and warn if it's not a valid signature. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 21:21:57
So actions signed by hardware and hardware sign-in?
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:35:18
A mimblewimble sidechain sounds amazing!
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:33:39
You could use the Trezor with Copay to create a 2 of 2 multisig wallet where the Trezor is one key and the computer is the other. (You would have to seeds to write down) If the Trezor was tampered with the hacker would also have to hack your computer. You don't have to worry about another hacker compromising your computer because they won't have the Trezor key. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:35:02
Anyone know what kind of multisg they will use to peg bitcoin to rootstock? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:03:45
This image is.. wtf! 
This part is interesting:
"We dont know for sure, except BitGo have said it wasnt a compromise of their servers. Bitfinex have indicated it was their end too (sorry I dont have time to find the references).
I believe the setup is BitGo and have 1 key, Bitfinex have the other two, one is stored offline. The process is likely to be something along the lines of Bitfinex will sign a transaction, then send it to BitGo's API and they countersign it, then it is broadcast.
We can speculate that hackers got access to the hot private keys on Bitfinex side (probably from their servers) as well as access to the BitGo API, again probably from Bitfinex's servers.
It appears that BitGo just automatically sign whatever they are asked to by Bitfinex, making it sort of not multisig.
We don't know what actually happened yet, until either BitGo or Bitfinex break the silence. But Bitfinex confirmed they lost just shy of 120,000BTC."

That's ok, I kind of want banks to be the last to adopt bitcoin and benefit the least ;)
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:13:14
Exchanges have automation and that increases risk plus larger amounts on internet exposed computers. Average Joe should just get a hardware wallet. I don't think anyone has had coins stolen off of a Ledger or Trezor. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 20:27:08
That's why I'm a fan of booting into Tails and using the Electrum seed as your paper wallet. Very little opportunity to screw up.  edit, I just wish Electrum could create a seed that's directly importable into a hardware wallet as apposed to booting Tails to send the balance to a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 02:34:42
If you ever decide to hold more than you can afford to lose you should get a hardware wallet such as the Trezor or Keepkey.

Plans on coinshuffle++?
@_date: 2016-08-01 04:18:25
It looks really cool. The only negative for me is the 3 attempts for pin before reset seems a little small. Some people might forget a pin but use a collection of pins and variants.

What kind of cool things would MAST enable or do to the bitcoin network?
@_date: 2016-04-22 00:16:39
I'd have two people you trust look over the computer who know bitcoin and look for a list of words written down somewhere usually containing 12 or 24 words on it.

Bitcoin gives universal access to a "swiss bank account" that traditionally was only available to the rich and powerful. Now everyone can play the same game.

Large amounts should be imported into a secure wallet such as a hardware wallet or something like Copay and set up as 2 of 2 multisig wallet.

A cool app idea would be for anyone who rents products such as cars or equipment, the owner or renter takes pictures and they are added to the Merkle trees. Any disputes that come about later have photographic evidence that certain damage or state existed at a certain time and impossible to go back and forge. It could be a very simple photo app with a quick method to verify the picture.

@_date: 2016-04-03 20:55:34
Because as people see how fucked up the financial system is, they may look for alternatives and so far bitcoin is the only thing offering something different.

Right now bitcoin is the only that is acting as money AND has decent liquidity.
@_date: 2016-04-21 23:37:16
Often the private key is under some type of sticker that is wrecked when removed. Sometimes they have labels that show an address or number to look up on a website to see it's value. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 16:23:06
I hope someone funds confidential transactions and coinjoin. Bitcoin really needs this final piece to be cash and a private currency.

That's also essentially what Copay does.

@_date: 2016-04-01 19:44:25
Thanks, sounds very cool but a little over my head, can you think of any examples of what it could enable?
@_date: 2016-04-03 03:56:02
You load them with any amount and they are designed so no one knows the private key until they are broken so they can be traded with a balance and you don't have to worry about a previous user emptying it. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:31:14
Companies getting hacked won't effect the hardware wallet.
If you are worried about a bad company sending bad hardware or tampered hardware you could use multisig with both Trezor and Ledger Nano S. Both companies or devices would have to be compromised with 2 of 2 multisig.
@_date: 2016-04-05 16:34:48

Copay. Simple for basic amounts and easy setup of multisig wallets when you want to store more. Plus it's opensource and runs on everything and backups are done using words on a piece of paper. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 20:38:43
I've only used the Trezor and it's very cool. With all of them you don't have to worry about hardware failures as they are backed up by writing words on paper (or put on cryptosteel) KeepKey has the advantage of a big screen while Trezor has the advantage as they are the main coders of the software that runs on both. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 23:55:22

Would it be useful to force the Trigger block only, to be &gt;1MB in size? It forces a fork at a more precise time instead of waiting for one to happen randomly later when a block is over &gt;1MB. 
Or instead of flag day, just say block X shall be &gt;1MB and under &lt;2MB.

Bitcoin's hiding in derivatives too?
@_date: 2015-12-01 05:10:24
I think compared to other opensource projects, Bitcoin has more drama because it directly deals with two subjects that people are emotional about: trust and money. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:07:45
So maybe the 1 million coins will be used to help bitcoin:
The trust fund PDF signed by Wright’s late friend David Kleiman keeps those coins locked in place until 2020, yet gives Wright the freedom to borrow them for applications including “research into peer-to-peer systems” and “commercial activities that enhance the value and position of bitcoin.”

If you are worried about being anonymous you should initialize it with the Chrome extension and use it with something like Electrum when done. Using mytrezor.com as a wallet means they have access to your master public key and would in theory enable them to see your linked transactions.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:08:06
The code is out now. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:02:34

So IF it was easy to spend gold and you had a large amount you would never buy anything and live a simple life because the value is going up? 
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:19:25

Ah, does Electrum servers learn the master public key though?
@_date: 2015-06-08 03:17:21
No but ideas can be.
@_date: 2015-06-11 00:37:59
True, but I think Electrum can use TOR if you want to be anonymous?
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:15:40
They aren't. Their profit motive is increasing Bitcoin's value not a new token. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:45:30
Looks like you create a wallet for importing and then just send it to your other wallet. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:39:17
My favorite part about Confidential Transactions:
...this scheme is compatible with pruning and does not make the verification state for Bitcoin grow forever. It is also compatible with CoinJoin and CoinSwap, allowing for transaction graph privacy as well while simultaneously fixing the most severe limitation of these approaches to privacy (that transaction amounts compromise their privacy).
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:09:12

I can't wait to see how it works!!
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:38:18
And when using Electrum make sure to select new wallet and not restore. The seed should never be typed onto a computer unless you no longer want it Trezor protected. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:57:20
I expect today or tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:18:00
For those who want to reduce trust in one company as much as possible, Copay supports the Trezor and can create a 2 of 2 multisig wallet where the Trezor is one key and your computer the other. This way an attacker would have to defeat both the Trezor and your home computer. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:09:38
The easiest way to never use mytrezor.com is to use the Chrome extension for setting up and Mycelium or Electrum for the wallet services. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 03:05:52
The words are the seed that recreates the entire wallet. Any of the receiving addresses can copied down.

@_date: 2015-06-09 02:09:37
You send BTC to an address that locks those bitcoins for use somewhere else. Another blockchain sees those locked bitcoins and allows equal share of their tokens for use. Once your are done you lock those sidechain tokens and it unlocks the bitcoins.

7 Conclusion:
Duplex micropayment channels solve a multitude of problems. For one they
enable near-infinite scalability for digital payments based on Bitcoin. Bitcoin
transactions are no longer used directly to transfer bitcoins from a sender to
a recipient, instead they are used to setup micropayment channels and handle
conflict resolution. The actual transfers are now handled at a higher level through
a network of payment service providers. The payments are end-to-end secure
thanks to the use of hashed timelock contracts, ensuring transfers between hops
are only performed if the intended recipient receives its payment. Unlike Bitcoin,
which requires a long confirmation process, transfers on a network of duplex
micropayment channels are secure from being reverted. Thus a payment network
using duplex micropayment channels is a far better fit for real-time scenarios,
e.g., buying a coffee, since transfers can be performed at the same speed messages
are passed in the Internet. With a network of payment service providers, Bitcoin
can support true micropayments with minimal fees at unprecedented scale, and
where the transfers clear in real-time.

My favorite part about Confidential Transactions:
...this scheme is compatible with pruning and does not make the verification state for Bitcoin grow forever. It is also compatible with CoinJoin and CoinSwap, allowing for transaction graph privacy as well while simultaneously fixing the most severe limitation of these approaches to privacy (that transaction amounts compromise their privacy).

You are actually more secure by being locked into a system for example iOS is very secure but as soon as you put your breadwallet seed on a different system you lose that security. To move your wallet just sent the total amount to the new one.

The device is one key while the company stores one key and Third Key Solutions secures the third key. (2 of 3 multisig)
From the FAQ:
Who holds the third key?
During first time setup for the device, you can choose where you want your recovery key stored. The default option is to store it in a secure vault operated by Third Key Solutions. If you wish to store your own third key, you will be prompted during the setup flow to scan the public key of your recovery private key. Please note that you will be responsible for signing a transaction with this private key if your device is lost or stolen, and we recommend this only as an advanced option for expert users.

One advantage is that restoring a wallet uses a similar method to pin entry so the computer is unable to see the words that make your seed. The Trezor does it in random order which means the computer knows the words but not the order. This means Trezor has to use more words to get the same security as KeepKey. Trezor is the main developer of the software that runs on both systems so Trezor might have the advantage there. 
@_date: 2016-03-12 01:20:24
Kind of weird: "...I think does not strike the kind of balance that we have lived with for 200-300 years and it's fetishizing our phones above every other value. And that can't be the right answer."
Seems almost Orwellian that he says people are fetishizing the phone and not privacy. He draws the parallel of going through someones underwear drawer. Might not be a perfect analogy as the police are limited by how many drawers they can search as they have to physically go there. Imagine if they could examine everyone's underwear drawer at once and keep records of each drawers contents for future reference! Risk of abuse is WAY higher.

Think of it as tiny bits of bitcoin that represent the authority to control something else.

Paypal is reversible and people will reverse it after you give them the bitcoins.

Other methods use a computer that may or may not have spyware on it. Hardware wallets create the private keys inside the device and are built to never share it with the computer making it immune to spyware.

IMHO it's complicated. Check out TAILS. If the user can boot into TAILS and copy a seed down they have a very simple and easy to use paper wallet with less steps to make a mistake on.

I find these "deaths" quite interesting. To kill bitcoin you would have to convince EVERYONE to no longer use bitcoin.

You are correct. The time the wallet exists on your computer they are at risk though. The safest is the isolate what knows the private keys by using a hardware wallet. Using a hardware wallet to create/restore a wallet means not even your computer gets to see the private keys.

As long as you quit the initialization before loading the wallet at the end by entering pin again the servers don't know your public keys. They also wouldn't know if you plan on using passwords with Electrum as each password creates new seeds.

The Trezor encrypts every password with a separate key and uploads it to Dropbox. Any time you need a password you decrypt it on the app. In theory the only exposure of the password is temporarily on your computer and if spyware was present the most they can access is the passwords you decrypt with the trezor. You never lose all your passwords like would happen if you have a master password and a database. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 16:14:27
This is where I hope OpenBazaar comes in. People can get bitcoins by selling local goods online. Cuts out a lot of 3rd parties.

Trezor. Or just get TAILS, boot into it, load Electrum and copy the seed onto paper and a receiving address. Reboot and all traces of the wallet are gone and the only exposure of the keys was on a very secure live cd. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:27:48
Yup or multiple good hiding locations. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 16:32:15
All bitcoins records are on the blockchain. To spend or move them you prove it with a kind of message that's signed by a private key. These keys are what the Trezor protects and never releases. All keys are derived from the seed you write down.

The riskiest part is sweeping them into a safe wallet. Hardware wallets like the Trezor are the safest for holding them. If you are planning on sending directly to an exchange to sell I would be tempted to just boot up TAILS and run Electrum and import the private keys and send it all to the exchange. If you don't send it all you need to back up your Electrum wallet by writing the seed down because your wallet will have change. Tails is nice because it's a live Linux CD and your risk of viruses and spyware is very low. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 03:30:25
Bitcoin would have to be worth a lot! 
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:54:24
To steal from a Trezor you need to physically steal it to examine the memory or steal the backup which is a list of words contained on paper. Viruses and spyware can't touch them at all. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 23:46:11

zcash seems like it might struggle to scale while bitcoin with confidential transactions will probably do better in that department.

You could always use it in a multisig setting and you don't have to fully trust it.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:01:54
The device was designed to be incapable of sending out the private keys. Any alteration of the software will give warnings when you plug it in.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:28:17
With the seed written down you can never lose your wallet due to digital failures. That is your backup for the the whole thing.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:20:57
Never store your back up words online. They are safe because they aren't on a computer. If you are worried about theft just get creative with the hiding spot. A list of words can be hidden in a lot of spots. You could take apart your window frame and write it on the wood below, put on paper dropped behind a wall, laminate it between other paper, hide the list in two parts in different locations. Keep in mind though that where you hide it can potentially get destroyed taking the backup with it. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 04:08:54

Yes a small one as I doubt anyone has spent the effort to tamper with them. You could always create a 2 of 2 multisig wallet with Copay where the Trezor is one signer and another Copay setup as the other signer. This would require a compromise of both your computer and Trezor.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:37:26
Electrum is risky for large amounts especially for windows users. If you want hard core security a Trezor might be worth it. Then you just need to back up a word list that is very likely understood well into the future. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 18:05:21
imho the safest place for bitcoins is a trezor.
@_date: 2016-06-15 00:00:31
There should be enough signalling that it locks in approx a week from now and then wait 2 weeks to complete.
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:52:16
Trezor allows multiple passwords or phrases. Each password creates a unique wallet. There is no way to know how many passwords or wallets you are using and any number of them could hold bitcoins with all other passwords holding 0. ;)
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:22:15
Dead still and quiet. A battered bull. lol  
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:38:28
If enough are signaling at difficulty adjustment it happens at the next adjustment.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:10:59
Yes, each phrase will create a wallet. You could fund "paper" with some btc and "yellow" with some. Each time you use those terms as a password the wallet will appear. The problem with passwords of course is you may forget it and there is no way to know how many passwords were used since the Trezor doesn't store or back up that info.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:47:17
A lot of current software uses those lists to restore wallets. It's popular enough that tools will exist for them for quite a while. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 00:12:00
I think the future is likely U2F. Hardware wallets will be perfect for it. The same security for safely storing bitcoins will also allow secure log-ins. Once the Trezor includes it, you just need to have it plugged in and press a button to get pretty much total security as the Trezor signs a message with a private key that never leaves the Trezor. I believe Ledger is also working on adding U2F. No need to move bitcoins around. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:57:55
I think it would be neat for vendors who don't actually want to hold all the btc for the app to advertise btc for sale in the background when someone makes a purchase then customers can sometimes show up with some money to buy the btc off of them. They might even buy a meal too! 
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:05:02
Trezor. Best way to never lose bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:07:19
and those who don't have iOS, TAILS is a bootable CD that is set up with Electrum and you can do a similar thing with it's seed. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:36:46
If you enter the PIN for password manager and after go to mytrezor.com wallet you don't need to enter PIN again. Not a big deal but if you unlock it for passwords you shouldn't leave the device unattended. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:45:51
Bitcoin is liberty!

That's normal. Most wallets require you to write down a list of words. These words can recreate every address the app will ever show. All addresses derive from the list. All the addresses can be reused but it's best policy for privacy to use a new one every time. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:37:53

Almost wonder if that's why Segwit is attacked so much. Would there be groups that are trying to stop it at all costs? If everything was left the same but bigger blocks it would be easier to track and censor transactions with the large data centers.

The bitcoins are still in your wallet just listed under a new address. Anytime you spend the wallet usually spends larger amount with the change going back to yourself.

Boot into TAILS. Load Electrum and write down the seed. Reboot and all traces of the keys are gone and TAILS is very secure for safely creating the private keys. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 01:28:54
You could do this and it wouldn't reduce seed security since you aren't using a tool to alter a seed and have to read it on a computer.
Print out the seed list with word numbers listed beside it. Don't type each word on the computer to look it up. Each word is a four digit number and use face cards for the zeroes and the others to match the digits. Takes 48 cards with multiple repeats so you may need a few decks but the zero repeats the most so face cards would work best.

By inputting the seed somewhere else you expose the private keys to the computer loading the seed. If you REALLY wanted to do it I imagine one of the safest ways would be with TAILS on a offline computer and load Electrum and restore the seed. Reboot when done testing. Rebooting will remove all traces of the seed.

A simple solution is to get the TAILS live cd and just load Electrum and write down the seed. That list is your paper wallet and can be restored at any time in Electrum using TAILS again. If you want to use bitcoin for purchases I recommend a hardware wallet.

On the accounts page in Mycelium you create a new account using the old seed. Then load the account and send all the BTC to the other account. Remember to write down the new seed. edit: you empty one account into your new seed or account

Miners can choose not to include transactions if they want. They don't get transaction fees but because they are smaller in size they spread throughout the network faster and are less likely to be orphaned and replaced by a competing block.

Usually when a transaction is created, it uses bitcoins associated with an address that is larger then the amount needed to send and the change is sent back to you at the same time. You won't see the address in the receive tab but it is in your wallet.

@_date: 2016-09-20 08:08:24
Step 5 isn't really needed. All you need to do is create one new account, write down the seed and send BTC to it. Once it's deleted the only way to see the account or restore it, is with the seed. If the phone is taken and a new account is attempted it will be nothing like the one you deleted. 
@_date: 2016-09-10 23:23:14
The other part is the resources to verify it all. Storing it is probably the easy part.

Bitcoin uses  and every address is just the public key represented in a form that is the bitcoin address. Every address correlates with a private key. You can get a public key from a private key but you can't get a private key when you know the public key. Wallets that are "HD" use a single seed to make unlimited private keys and associated public keys without having to ever back up your wallet more than once.

All they would do is engrave or make the coin with the encrypted private key while you supply the public address. So they engrave some string and when you use that string plus your password you get the real private key. I don't know the precise details.

It's a great way to fund development but unlike bitcoin there is no "lock-in" or situation where changing platforms is difficult. For example: for a crypto-currency to beat bitcoin the mining infrastructure would be vastly disrupted and it's not a matter of just cloning software. Once factom is more mature there is nothing to stop a clone appearing that removes the factoids and uses bitcoin instead of factoids. The security would identical in both because they both use bitcoin's mining resources for security.

Trezor is cheaper and has had more time for peer review. KeepKey is pretty much the same but more expensive and a fancier display. Case is the easiest and doesn't even need internet or how to use bitcoin but uses 2of3 multisig. The device has one key, Case holds one that signs things as long as your thumb scan matches, and the third key is kept by you or their third party provider. My own personal bet is Trezor being the safest.

The wording on the backup page is kind of awkward with multisig.  Makes it seem like I only need the backup phrase for 2 -2 wallet. Perhaps it should say:
To restore this 2-2 shared wallet you will need:
1. Your wallet seed and access to the server that coordinated the initial wallet creation. You still need 2-2 keys to spend.
2. OR the wallet seeds of ALL copayers in the wallet. 
Also at the bottom it says: "Once you have copy your wallet seed" should be "Once you have copied your wallet seed down"

I think the hardware wallets that are used for bitcoins will be used for identity as well. Instead of having a username and password you would just need to link a public key with your ID. No passwords to be hacked or stolen. Then to sign in you sign random text with the private key to authenticate. Trezor and other tools are experimenting with BitID/BitAuth.

Tech giant developing its own version of blockchain technology, plans to release open source software within next few months
International Business Machines Inc. thinks the technology that underpins the bitcoin digital currency can do a lot more than support cash 2.0. Within the next few months, the venerable tech giant plans to release open source software that could be used to create digital contracts that—like bitcoin transactions—would be recorded publicly and securely on a world-wide computer network.
IBM is zeroing in on a technology called blockchain, which serves as bitcoin’s online ledger. Blockchain allows the bitcoin network to track the currency’s movement from one online wallet to another. But it could be used to log other types of transactions.
“Blockchain, as a technology, is extremely interesting and intriguing,” said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president of IBM Research.
Over the past year, IBM researchers have been developing their own version of blockchain, which the company said could be used to create secure online contracts. Mr. Krishna isn’t sure who, if anyone, would embrace a project the company so far regards as experimental. But it could log transactions between banks or international businesses, or—more interestingly—let banks and businesses share the same system of record. For example, when a Chinese supplier and a U.S. buyer agreed that a product had been delivered, a U.S. bank could pay the supplier instantly over the Internet.
IBM isn’t the only company testing the blockchain’s potential in what have been called smart contracts. Overstock.com and symbiont.io Inc. last month introduced blockchain-based platforms designed to speed up and simplify trading securities.
IBM in January announced an earlier blockchain-style experiment, called Adept, designed to monitor connected devices. The new effort is a separate endeavor.
IBM has a history of legitimizing open-source projects among its corporate customers. It helped move the Linux operating system and the Apache Web server into the mainstream in the late 1990s. Mr. Krishna hopes the new technology will do the same thing for blockchain. The company has devoted dozens of researchers to the project, he said. They are modifying the original bitcoin code to operate without currency, ensure that contract details remain private and make it easier for companies to embed business rules into their smart contracts—for example, automatically paying for a package upon delivery.
One of IBM’s challenges is building a system that anyone can participate in while also thwarting spam or abuse, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a bitcoin advocacy group.
IBM says it is aware of the issue and is working on solutions. For example, the company could have its ledger managed by a consortium of businesses.
Using open source software to shake up the world of contracts is no simple matter. But the payoff could be huge, Mr. Krishna said.
“I want to extend banking to the 3.2 billion people who are going to come into the middle class over the next 15 years,” he said. “So I need a much lower cost of keeping a ledger. Blockchain offers some intriguing possibilities there.”

Wall Street is putting more money behind a technology it once dismissed as a fad.
Some of the biggest companies in the financial sector have invested $30 million in Chain Inc., a San Francisco-based company that works with banks and other institutions to develop ways to trade and transfer financial assets using the system that underpins the virtual currency Bitcoin.
Investors include Visa Inc., Nasdaq Inc., Citi Ventures, Capital One Financial Corp., Fiserv Inc. and Orange SA.
A valuation for Chain wasn’t disclosed as part of the fundraising round, which Chain announced on Wednesday. The company also said former American Express Co. CEO and venture capitalist Jim Robinson III has joined its board.
The investment is the latest sign of Wall Street’s about-face with Bitcoin, which banks and other financial firms initially said was unlikely to transform commerce. These financial companies don’t have any interest in using the actual currency. But they see the “blockchain” technology that lets Bitcoin users instantaneously make and record transactions as a potential replacement for what they say is a cumbersome, costly and less-secure process.
Vast bureaucracies exist inside banks and at third-party firms to verify and process the buying and selling of everything from foreign currencies to stocks.
The blockchain is a record of every transaction ever made using Bitcoin. But rather than being held in a central database or institution, it is spread out over a network of independent computers and verified continuously by participants in the network instead of a central authority. Other blockchains have been created unrelated to Bitcoin.
Its proponents say the technology might make it possible for a stock or other asset to change owners in the blink of an eye, instead of the roughly three days and several steps of intermediaries it takes now.
While the technology is gaining popularity among many on Wall Street, it could take years before a critical mass of financial institutions agree to throw their weight behind a new protocol for processing and clearing transactions.
There are also questions about whether blockchains can be secure enough to handle a huge influx of sensitive transactions and how easily legacy financial institutions could start making such a radical change to the way they operate.
“We believe in the power of blockchain technology to transform how financial assets are transferred, but it has to be done with the right partners to insure it gets off the ground,” said Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, in an interview.
The company is working with Nasdaq on using the technology to facilitate the trading of stakes in unlisted companies on its private market, but Nasdaq is able to set that up without cooperation from other institutions.
To change something bigger, such as how stocks or corporate bonds are transferred among investors, will require broad agreements from across the financial sector.
“The devil is in the details,” said Houman Shadab, a law professor at New York Law School who studies blockchains. “There’s a lot of work to do in building a consensus on how to do it and migrating existing technologies onto a new and untested platform.”
Chain is among a handful of startups vying to dominate the new field of blockchain technology for Wall Street. Other contenders are New York-based Digital Asset Holdings LLC, headed by former J.P. Morgan &amp; Chase Co. executive Blythe Masters, and San Francisco-based Ripple Labs Inc.
The growing challenge in securely moving assets around the globe is reminiscent of another major event in the markets, the Paperwork Crisis of 1968, according to some industry experts.
At that time, transactions were settled with the delivery of physical certificates. But the volume of trading had risen so quickly that firms were awash in paper. The situation got so bad that the New York Stock Exchange had to reduce trading to four days a week.
To help solve the problem, brokers and exchanges helped create what is now called the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp., a central body that facilitates clearing and settlement for the financial markets. The DTCC says today it clears more than $1.6 quadrillion of transactions a year.
Many of the processes at the heart of the financial system, including some at the DTCC, were built around how to automate paper-based transactions.
“Those processes that came after the paperwork crisis were better, but there is a need now for a more elegant and better solution,” said Hans Morris, a former president of Visa who runs a financial technology investment firm Nyca Partners. Nyca has agreed to make an investment in another blockchain company called Clearmatics Technologies Ltd. in the U.K.
Rob Palatnick, chief technology architect of the DTCC, said the appeal of blockchain is its use of cryptography, which he says increases security of transactions and could streamline some of the legacy systems of Wall Street.
“The technology does provide answers to some of the fundamental problems of the financial sector,” he said.
The DTCC itself is exploring blockchain technologies and is planning to launch its first pilot project by the end of the year.
“It feels like everything else in the world has gone digital, except money and assets,” said Mr. Ludwin of Chain. “That’s changing one way or another.”

New York-based R3, whose chief executive David Rutter is a former head of Icap’s electronic broking business, on September 15 announced it was being backed by a consortium of banks including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, State Street, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.
Rutter said: "I chose to start with the banks because they are the ultimate consumers. So it's like the way Boeing built the 787 – by talking to customers and airlines and stewards and stewardesses."
R3 is working on developing commercial applications based on distributed ledger technology, of which blockchain is an example. FN discusses the consortium's plans.
Financial News: What is R3 trying to do?
David Rutter: We are trying to build the first true financial-grade ledger that is fit for purpose for financial markets – strong enough, secure enough and [able] to handle hundreds of billions of transactions a day. We call it the 'fabric', which is the foundational layer on which promising applications can be built on. Through collaboration we are also trying to bring efficiencies to the various experiments that R3 and its bank members have done. And then from that, using the intelligence gained from the proof of concepts and the lab experiments, we want to build commercial applications that solve some Wall Street problems or bring efficiencies to our members.
How will this interact with initiatives the banks are developing internally? For example UBS, an R3 partner, is building a utility settlement coin…
UBS and other members are running their own experiments but they realise that a financial grade 'fabric' does not yet exist. So they would work with us on developing that architecture. And then they would also share the learnings of their experiments with other members of R3. One of the main drivers for this early stage partnership is that the proof of concepts we are all working on independently are not things that can work in isolation. You need to have the industry get behind them. So if you have a promising use of the blockchain, in settlement for example, getting others involved is better.
Why has interest in the blockchain by banks exploded in recent months?
I think that as banks have put more resources on it and spent more time experimenting with it, the value of shared distributed ledgers has become more apparent to those that have been at it longer. So I think that everyone feels that the probability of a shared distributed ledger solution bringing efficiencies to certain of Wall Street's processes is quite high and will invest in it.
What are some of the areas that you believe are ripe for blockchain applications?
Just in our working group alone we have framed out about a dozen possible solutions and what we hope to do is be intelligent about which ones we pursue in part by the information we gather in the second pillar of our business which is the lab environment. There is a lot of talk about clearing and settlement, and those cases are quite viable. Even the issuance of securities on the blockchain is viable. But I am cautious when I read other people make determinations about what the best use of the blockchain is at this early stage in the technology. That is one of the reasons why we have chosen intelligent collaboration over picking one thing.
When might we expect blockchain being applied in mainstream finance?
We could in a year to two years' time prove how the blockchain could replace certain processes and create significant savings for the industry and also be more secure and cut out on errors that exist today. But then rolling that out, replacing the current system, the migration that is required to do that is more of a multi-year thing.
Could it just be a hype?
I think there have been enough resources put in to this field that the chances of it being all hype are quite small. Could you have bitcoin disappear? Quite possibly. But I think it's unlikely that the bunch of smart guys that we have assembled to R3 with the group of banks can't come up with practical uses of this technology.
Do you think that blockchain has the potential to make clearing houses and custodians irrelevant?
It has the potential to completely change the workflow and maybe even the value proposition of clearing houses and custodians. But I think that it would be naïve to think those entities that offer very valuable service go away with this technology – that is the kind of stuff that I hear more in California than in New York.
So are you reaching out to other market participants like clearing houses, which could lose out lot from this technology?
We have not reached out to them to date but we are keenly interested in working collaboratively and we want to help Wall Street evolve. It's an evolution not a revolution. So we are keen to work with all the participants but, as you must appreciate, a group of the biggest banks in the world is difficult enough so we plan on doing things incrementally.
Are there actually enough people at the banks who know about this stuff?
It’s grown very rapidly. As you would expect there are varying degrees of financial and human resource commitment at the various banks, but the ones that have signed up in this partnership are certainly keenly aware of the possibilities and have put resources aside.
Consortia have often proved hard to manage. How do you make sure this one goes smoothly?
I have been on the Street for 32 years, I've run big businesses, I've run start-ups and this is my fifth consortium, so I am keenly aware of the difficulties. But I am quite sure that both the contractual construct that we have agreed and the enthusiasm of the partners about the potential to save money in the financial sector, when it [has] never mattered more, all add to making it the right sauce at the right time.

A group of people are in a room. There is a blank book and a pen (blockchain). All the people are given a many-sided die (mining machines). Whoever rolls a 1 first gets a poker chip from a pile of unique chips and can write in the book the chip they won and write down any trades people are doing. It continues as people get many poker chips. All the people can trade by announcing who is getting their chips by telling them the chip serial number (broadcast transaction) but some whisper trades for chips already spoken for (double spend). The winner of the dice rolls gets another chip and writes down all the trades they heard and are recorded in the book as long as it's a valid trade. (confirmations) People slowly invest in more dice to win more chips but to keep the pace of distributing chips the same the people eventually have to get two 1's and then three 1's. (difficulty increase)
Still needs work but I think it almost explains it. I've thought about a video of people doing it to see if it makes sense to non-technical people.

If the process is subordinate to the law, it is “owned” by the law exclusively, undermining the benevolent force of competition (for better or for worse)." -

Same location then wiping does nothing. If you left it laying around and used it for spending amounts you could use another seed you are not as careful with.
@_date: 2016-10-04 05:05:36
I'd just write the seed down, wipe the Trezor so no one can get anything on it if you lose it, and safely store the seed. The seed should work on many devices for a long time.

My wild guess for 21 is chargers. They plug into a wall and are separate from the phone and accumulate satoshi's for when the owner's phone is plugged in. The charger could be a thing on the internet of things.

Can't 0 conf transactions just be done differently with the magic of CLTV and multisig? A service could be set up that automatically joins any multisig wallet to create 2of2, 3of3, 4of4, wallets with CLTV taking place months in the future enabling spending without the service. The service then promises that it will sign anything as long as it is not a double spend. Slowly people would trust the service and the double spending is protected outside of the network. It could be added into wallets with a simple wizard to create the multisig setup. Their key isn't for any security but rather just a cosigner that doesn't ever double spend. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:00:56
My favorite method:
Download and burn TAILS iso to disk.
Reboot computer with disk in it and load Electrum on the apps menu.
Write down the seed on paper. Write down an address for receiving. 
Reboot and all traces will be gone. No need to create persistent storage.  
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:26:43
Older video. Now you just need to get TAILS boot into it and open Electrum and write down the seed and a couple of addresses and reboot. Simple and safe.

I would just use the default tails setup with 12 words on paper. Use your Trezor on your main setup and send bitcoins to your tails wallet when you need more for spending from it. This will also help isolate your tails spending from your other wallet if privacy is also a concern.

Serious question but why can't wallets just display "Unsafe transaction wait for a confirmation" any time it sees an RBF transaction? The transition would suck but wouldn't it be better in the long run?
@_date: 2015-10-31 20:06:13
I would just use TAILS. Boot into it and write down the Electrum seed on paper. Because it's a Linux live CD it's very secure and just by writing down the seed and a few addresses you have a very secure wallet that completely disappears when you reboot the computer. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 02:29:25

Viruses and spyware would be your biggest risk. I think Electrum would be the weakest for security on a basic computer with Mycelium a little bit more secure. If you want cold storage downloading TAILS and running Electrum to get a new seed and address could be a way to go as the Live CD is secure and rebooting removes all trails of the keys. Just make sure to write the seed down properly. For ultimate security I would recommend the Trezor.

@_date: 2015-03-07 15:24:53
I'm not familiar with macs but the tails site should have docs on how to do it. Once you have it, you just unplug your internet, boot into it, and run Electrum. It will give you the choice of creating a new wallet and you write the seed down and write some addresses down after. Once you reboot nothing will be saved on the computer and the only record of that wallet are on paper.

-it looks just like a normal bitcoin address so there is no leak of security policy (no one knows how many parts are needed)
-better for privacy since n of m reveals a type of of multisig and harder to mix

A hash in the blockchain proves something existed since a certain time but if they embed a hash of very recent block into the data or video and quickly input the final file hash into the blockchain you can narrow down the possibilities of when the event occurred to a very small time frame.

Check out TAILS live CD. It forces all connections through TOR and because it is a live CD it's very secure. It comes with Electrum and as long as you write the seed down you don't have to have any digital copies. Anytime you want to use your bitcoins you just boot into it and enter your seed and reboot when you are done.

You pretty much need to use software that will brute force it. Or give to someone else to do but they will have access to your bitcoins. There is no way to know it's length or features. You have to guess passwords based on what you know.

Depends on your level of paranoia. TAILS is a linux distro so it's very safe and all internet must go through TOR. If you are worried the only thing I'd do is maybe unplug the internet. If you want really good security and still easy I'd recommend a TREZOR.

Bitcoin has the most liquidity. This makes it the better digital currency for larger amounts. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 20:51:59
If say you have 1 bitcoin at address A when you don't, when you try to relay it through the network every person in the network can instantly see that the address A doesn't have 1 bitcoin and will ignore you. It will not show as a valid transaction. 
Copying a wallet is kind of like copying a password. Bitcoins are associated with private keys and copying the key just means there is more keys around not the number of bitcoins that are matched with the key.
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:32:32
Thanks. But couldn't the initialization use some type of look up table so the computer isn't displaying the seed and only the person who has the card knows what the word is. (I'm imagining a table where the words are looked up based on a grid like "E-13" and they find the word to write down. Each one would come with a unique card with words randomly mixed but paired with the device)
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:31:09

Best part:
After going through his explanation of BIP 47, Odom also revealed a side effect of widespread use of reusable payment codes to the audience:
“You know what this means? This means that all those companies who are sprouting up to provide blockchain analytics on the source of funds — these companies are not going to last. They’re going to cease to exist. They are a temporary aberration. They’re building on the past instead of the future.”
Odom added that Stash and Samourai Wallet are currently working together to get reusable payment codes implemented into usable software. He concluded his spiel on BIP 47 by stating, “This stuff is coming. Coders are coding on it.”

I don't think the concern is speed but adding another speculative layer to the whole thing that's not needed.

At least with payment codes you can register a name to map to it and you never have to keep updating to a newer bitcoin address. Hopefully wallets integrate blockchain ID. Then all we need to share is blockchain ID's.

Probably because most people would find that annoying to have your computer grind away all the time and CPU's are kind of useless for mining, even if lot's of people do it with utorrent for example. (I think utorrent is actually mining other coins).
You are on the right track but I think ASIC's in appliances are the way to go with expiry dates after they are not as useful and the ASIC's just offset the cost of the appliance because mining revenue goes to the maker of the appliance.

He's absolutely correct in that it makes a great "hot" wallet with something like the Trezor for storing larger amounts. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:25:11
There would be a wallet.dat file on the hard drive the software was on. Without it, the coins are gone.

Yes, multiple wallets support Trezor devices. I like Copay and Trezor together.
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:05:30
Cool. I wouldn't store much on it because of security concerns and breadwallet for iOS and Mycelium for Android offer more security (non rooted phones). Enjoy bitcoining!

Because rather than use bitcoin's miners (and increase the value of the bitcoin token) they are creating a whole different mining ecosystem. It's wasteful, adds a new speculative asset, and ultimately will likely be replaced by a Ethereum sidechain after a few people have lost money betting on the non sidechain version. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 23:05:11
A Trezor is great if you want to store a lot. They are very secure and easy to use. You get very good security with very little knowledge needed.

You use the same setup and in Electrum you select create new wallet and pick hardware wallet. It will use the same addresses.

Are you sure you are using the same password? Each password has it's own wallet and will show zero unless you funded that password. Or at least thats how it works with Trezor.

Brainwallets are extremely risky and there are huge databases of passwords and phrases waiting for bitcoins to be sent to it. I always recommend people just let the software create a random seed and use it instead of a password or phrase. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:30:19
That is right, you could also use the Trezor seed in Mycelium but once that is done the security is no longer hardware protected. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:55:29
Well you could copy it by hand and store in two locations. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:31:08
Even with the card. Think of the password as an extra word.

Is their a limit to how many are going to be made?
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:57:40
From a security perspective it might be better to be not interchangeable. iOS is very secure but putting the seed on Windows destroys the security for example. At least you can send from one wallet to another. If breadwallet seeds only work on iOS there is very little chance for a newbie to screw it up. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:28:53

BIP101 does not mean putting Hearn in charge. BIP101 can go into bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:52:24
Anytime you expose private keys there is some risk, but depending on how it's used it can be very little risk. For example, if you wanted to spend some funds you could go back into tails enter the seed and spend some bitcoins. Then reboot. Your private keys were on the computer but because it is tails it's all erased on reboot. Being linux also helps as the risk of someone finding those keys while you are in the system breifly would be extremely rare. Your main risk with tails would be someone plugging a hardware spying device on your computer. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 23:02:26
Those 12 words are all that's needed to recreate a wallet. The Electrum software converts it to private keys and doesn't need electrum.com to exist at all. 
The only reason it asks to type them in is to make sure you wrote them down. Those keys exist on your computer all the time. For large amounts you need something like a Trezor. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 23:18:42
Seed can be entered in Mycelium for Android. After entering the seed the security of the seed is no longer secured by Trezor and if you find the Trezor again you would need a new seed that wasn't used anywhere else.

@_date: 2015-03-07 13:50:04
Perhaps you will find it one day and you end of being a holder because you had no choice. Without the seed the BTC are stuck. 
If the formatting was recent you could grab a forensics live cd and scan for certain strings and it might find your seed. You would likely have to visit the forums for exact procedures.  
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:51:10

The biggest risk is probably hardware keyloggers or weak password as Linux on a live cd is pretty secure. Could be unknown exploits though. Trezor still is more secure but for many tails is secure enough.

Booting into TAILS with no internet would probably be the safest. Load Electrum and input the seed. Note that entering the seed on to something other than a Trezor does increase risk of screwing up something.

Compared to other live CD's it's probably the safest way to make paper wallets as live CD's usually have low entropy and they strengthened it's random number generator. And you only need to write down 12 words and not print a private key!

@_date: 2015-02-27 06:20:31
Going into mining would be the way to go with government run mining farms. It would protect them from the speculative bubble that would likely follow as their source of bitcoins will be mining. They could then in turn invest in research into cheaper energy, cooling, and computer technology. By mining they also have control over what transactions are put in their own blocks. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 15:28:04
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:19:25
But they would still be advertising a version bit and still counts towards it's activation even if the miner doesn't really want it. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:16:16
1. Sending TO the address over and over is fine. The privacy and security concerns are about sending FROM that address over and over. Electrum doesn't use sending addresses over and over. 
2. Electrum addresses are all deterministic so the watch addresses and the offline computer addresses will be identical.
@_date: 2016-05-20 03:36:14
You would be surprised how simple a Trezor is. It may effect your odds.Just don't type your seed out on anything but a Trezor. ;)
