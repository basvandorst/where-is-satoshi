I love Coinbase and would hate it if they were shutdown.  I also do not believe that they should be required to obtain a license for the services they provide.  However, I am worried that they may be a target for some arm of the US government.
Is anyone else worried about this?

If you tick the box and try to buy, but the transaction doesn't happen immediately, just cancel the transaction.

I have never seen a case where Coinbase has not made the customer whole.  It may take a few days or a couple of weeks but in the end they always honor the original price.  I doubt they'll be losing any lawsuits any time soon.

What are your expectations?  Bitcoin is here to stay as a digital currency and payment system.  If you are interested in it and think you could use it, you can always jump in.
If you are hoping to invest and do well, many people in this sub would say it is never too late and Bitcoin will continue to rise for the next few years.  Others will say that you should avoid it as an investment because of its volatility.

You want to use a site like Mt. Gox, BTC-e or Bitstamp.  Do not try to use Coinbase for this purpose.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:32:04
Please do not use Coinbase for timing the market.  If you want to get into daytrading, you need to setup an account on an exchange such as Bitstamp or Mt. Gox.
Your best bet at this point in time is to buy and hold, especially if you have no experience in daytrading.

Go to the transaction details.  It will tell you exactly how much you spent and how many BTC you will get.

@_date: 2013-11-18 20:03:19
That's your issue most likely.  If you sent this FROM blockchain.info, I believe that if it goes unconfirmed for a certain period of time, blockchain.info will cancel the transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:36:36
They have been having issues since June, but details are sketchy.  Others may be able to chime in with their experiences.

Right now situations like this are only theoretical.  If things went completely dark it would be very difficult to use the actual Bitcoin network.  However, in dire circumstances humans tend to figure things out and make it work, so it is possible that mesh cell or wifi networks could come up and achieve connection to a Bitcoin peer.  There are developers/companies working on ways to use mobile phones to setup peer to peer networks but things are very early.  See   As I understand it Android and iOS would have to be modified to make true peer to peer networks possible with mobile phones, but it seems like the most promising option.

It is extremely volatile right now.  There is no way to predict what will happen next.  It could even soar or crash today, with the outcome of the hearing in Washington.  This makes it difficult to use as a currency, but not impossible.

Exactly.  This is why I am worried.  They may think that they've found a loophole, but as we have seen in the past, that does not stop some government organization from coming in and shutting everything down.  I am worried about people keeping a significant amount of bitcoins in their account.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:35:03

There has been a spike in volume.  They are most likely attempting to throttle things.  This happens every once in a while with them.

There are various exchanges that you can use to convert back into your local currency, depending on where you are located.  For US, Bitstamp or CampBX would probably work for you.  You can also try Coinbase if you are in the US.
Given your limited budget, mining is not for you.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:42:23
A transaction doesn't show up in the block chain until it gets into a block, which means getting a confirmation.
What you are asking is how long until a notable number of network nodes see your transaction.  Usually it is just a few seconds, even without a fee.  It will vary depending on how well-connected to the network your node is (whether it's on your computer, or a third-party service like Blockchain.info or Coinbase).  However, you will have a hard time getting a quick confirmation if you do not include a fee.

@_date: 2013-11-19 13:42:45
That fee should have been fine.  You may just want to wait it out.  If it goes unconfirmed for a certain period I believe blockchain.info will cancel the transaction.  I don't know how long that takes though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:06:02
There is a chance, but many people think it will rise higher than it is today.  No reason to wait to buy in.

Coinbase interfaces directly with your bank account.  Anytime you buy and sell bitcoin on Coinbase, you are making a bank transaction.  This is why there is a delay.  If you want to do daytrading, you need to use an exchange like Bitstamp or Mt. Gox.  You can do an initial buy on Coinbase, but transfer to the exchange to do the trading.  This way you can react quickly to changes in the market and not wait for the bank transactions to go through.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:09:33
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:33:16
What I'm saying is that even though the notice is there, you can still execute the buy and it goes through instantly at the price shown.  This is what I experienced yesterday.  Give it a try.  If the transaction doesn't go through instantly like normal, you can cancel it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:12:38
There's no real official word but it seems like they use that notice to throttle transactions when there is high volume.  It was on and off yesterday.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:32:07
This comes up often.  You have to contact support.  Your transaction was flagged by an automatic detector.  They can whitelist your account and they usually will honor the original price.  You may have to wait a few days for a response.

@_date: 2013-11-19 14:58:19
I am fully aware of others having the issue.  In the vast majority of cases, Coinbase honors the original price and it's important for people to know that.  That's all I'm saying.

Try to find someone locally to buy from, localbitcoins.com where you will pay no fees.  Otherwise, try Coinbase.com.  They can tie to your bank account and the fees are very low (US).

@_date: 2013-11-19 03:56:15
It could be that blockchain.info is not prioritizing the transaction since there is no fee.  You will just need to give it time.  If it goes unconfirmed for a certain period of time (up to blockchain.info) then they will cancel the transaction.  
It could also be that blockchain.info is having issues dealing with the volume although I used them for multiple transactions today and did not have any problems (although I included the default fees).
Next time you should include a fee.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:39:04
Yes, it could be.  They don't publish details about their anti-fraud system, but it has been known to flag legitimate purchases.  Unfortunately you won't know until the day that you are supposed to receive the coins.  If your transaction does get canceled, you just need to send in a ticket and they usually honor your original purchase price.

This article is a couple of days old at this point, but they could be dealing with a similar issue.  I transferred a small number of coins out of my Coinbase wallet earlier today and it was basically instant.  Maybe they are manually reviewing large BTC transfers?

That's not at all true.  If you log a ticket after being canceled, they will honor the original purchase price, meaning they could potentially lose money.

If you are just looking for an easy way to get some coins, use Coinbase.  They are really geared toward consumers and are backed by well-known investors.  I doubt they will be going anywhere anytime soon.
If you want to get in on the day-trading action, go with a more traditional exchange like Mt. Gox or Bitstamp, but proceed with caution.

Because you can not maintain a balance of USD on Coinbase.  This means every time you buy or sell, Coinbase performs a transaction with your bank.  This type of transaction is subject to delays and cancellations depending on your bank and/or Coinbase.
