Bad idea because: taxable event, selling alts now is the worst time when they are so low with high btc dominance (do the opposite)
Good idea because: maybe you in the green on them, don't fully understand or want to know and keep up with them, in the short term maybe going all btc could be more profitable or not
Imo, learn more about each one before you do anything.

I've seen a recent YT stream of him and his endless rant about not understanding Bitcoin or how it has value as he struggles with running his stream. He is very pro gold like endlessly shilling it because of how old of a currency it is. It's funny though seeing so many people throwing donations at him to try to convince him to get onboard. Supposedly he only has 2-5btc that was given to him long ago and worth 30-40k that he doesn't plan on selling. Super conflicted and hypocritical guy.

Price is only 7900 and here I was thinking that there was a real sale going on. Would love to buy some at 6500 if any is interested.
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:47:06
Great story. It's evidence that ATH buyers need not to be so scared as long as they make a lot of smaller buys spread out. Also it makes it more clear that having 1btc will be more and more precious as so few can risk much more than 10k.

This is very true and is the reason why I'm looking into alts but will never go all in on any of them. There are good non-competing ways of doing cryptocurrency or using blockchain that are worth exploring and a small investment.

For most people it is very hard to put 10k of their savings into something with risk. When there is such a departure of a 10k floor having .x or .0x will be the normal hodl amount.

You'll want to do more research regarding tax on capital gains than what I or anyone here will tell you. 
I'm not certain but I don't think Coinbase reports to IRS unless there were transactions of &gt;=20k or gains of 10k+.

"But how else do we stop/slow the dip? We need people to buy bitcoins to keep the price up so we have time to sell it before it completely collapses"
This is the exact problem here. The idea to say anything to get the "noobs" to buy is wrong. Just another form of manipulation. It's going to piss away so much potential for stable long term investors that don't know enough about what is going on and what btc is.

Bch still hasn't recovered since the 500 at the beginning the best recent time to sell was 470 and now it's down to 430 again. Anyone cashing out from the beginning up to 800 did well. If Coinbase allowed bch for btc it would have crashed far worse. B2x has a lot more people that want to get rid of it than buy or hodl.

I don't know if it's the answer but I think it would be good to have another check beyond 2fa security before transactions to remind people to not do something stupid, irrational, or emotional (fear-&gt;loss) before committing to it.
