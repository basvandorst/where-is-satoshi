I'm definitely not the "real FUD".  I have zero fear, uncertainty, or doubt.  What I do know is that blockchain tech will be the future of financial transactions.  China making an exit in no way disrupts the crypto markets long term.  It creates this current down cycle but for sure there will be a myriad of posters getting on here weeks and months from now wishing they had hodled or bought more at lower prices.  With a 98% dev support for BTC how exactly is it you think this is something crypto markets will never recover from?  Futures markets are betting HEAVILY against your statement.  People who spent their lives in currency trading are betting HEAVILY against your statement.  Low prices make is SUPER DUPER easy for large scale commercial firms to come in and scoop up millions at discount prices.  By all mean brother...tuck tail and run.  Sell all you have and listen to Warren Buffet who knows jack shit about crypto.  THEY are the ones creating the FUD because THEY have the massive fear of being marginalized by blockchain and losing hundreds of billions in transaction fees.  So much disinformation being spread right now and the masses of sheep are doing EXACTLY what THEY know the sheep will do.
Don't take my word for it brother.  Sell everything you have.  Please.

People who are panic selling are doing exactly what "they" want you to do.  Why would "they" want to pay full price for your BTC when they can convince you the sky is falling and scoop it up for pennies on the dollar after massive panic sells. This is beyond the HODL.  I just doubled down on MOAR BTC!!!  HODL TO THE MOON BITCHES !!!

BTW...when you read an article published by the The Wall Street Journal titled: China Quietly Orders Closing of Bitcoin Mining Operations
There is nothing "quiet" when the largest financial publication on the planet is reporting on it.  Seems almost by design huh?  
Yeah...take a moment to reflect on that for a minute then tell me exactly how that correlates with something else that occurred today.
Here's another question.  What is the most powerful weapon on the planet?  Nope..not nuclear weapons.

Here's the way BTC wins.  Anyone who accepts BTC as a form of payment uses that BTC as a form of payment to someone who in turn uses that BTC as a form of payment to someone else who accepts BTC as a form of payment.  No one ever converts their BTC to fiat and it circulates to infinity.  This is NO DIFFERENT in how current fiat systems work, however, the main difference is BTC increases in inherent value because it is....wait for it....a limited supply.  Therefore BTC can ONLY GO UP IN VALUE as a commodity in limited supply.
I've said it a billion times.  The key to longevity for BTC is ADOPTION, ADOPTION, ADOPTION.
EDIT:  BTC is not technically a commodity, however, it behaves like one
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:20:30
I'm not saying BTC was not overvalued.  It certainly was.  And it has nothing to do with its usefulness as a technology.  That's been proven.  The key to longevity is all about adoption and keeping the cycle clean from fiat conversion.  Know what I mean or am I being obscure?

And 99% of that 10% were micro transactions.  And BTW...dumping is not what this is.  When you dump an asset you are telling people it is worthless.  It's not like the BTC people are selling are just sitting somewhere ready to be bought up.  They are now owned by OTHER people.
The price of BTC was definitely over valued but it was what people were willing to pay during the December to Remember sales event.

When they unload their BTC the price of BTC will plummet so buying BTC at a low price is only worthwhile if the price of BTC increases again.  I'm not saying it wouldn't but once the whales dump all of their coins the price of BTC will never be anywhere near some of the highs we have seen lately.

Poor customer service has absolutely nothing to do with regulation.  There are plenty of companies in regulated industries who have shitty customer service.  Coinbase's shitty customer service is indicative of poor leadership at the top level.  Too many people think customer service is simply about someone replying to their request for support.  
There is an entire ecosystem that needs to be put into place to run a successful customer service team.  
From having the correct and proper technology, process control, proper escalation procedures, time decay on support tickets, resolution tools available to a customer service rep, automation where needed and live help where needed, correct categorization of support tickets, workflow management, properly trained customer service reps, etc.  Coinbase clearly lacks experienced leadership in this area.  And I mean leadership at the top.  Any CEO worth their weight knows the number 1 way of improving revenue and capturing more profits is through happy customers. Brian Armstrong who is the founder and CEO of Coinbase worked as a software engineer prior to starting Coinbase.  He doesn't have the first clue to how a successful customer service department should be run.

Very simply if the investor bet the price of BTC would be higher or lower at the contract expiration date then which ever bet they made they make money.  If the price moves against them then they lose money.  This is why futures markets hates instability.  And being that the price of BTC is being represented by the trading volume of Gemini this means the price is highly open to manipulation.  Gemini is one of the smallest trading exchanges for BTC and is not a true representation of the global average trading price of BTC.
The point I was making with my OP is that if the masses of BTC hodlrs actually hodl then WE can control the stability of the market versus Wall Street firms.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:59:47
And this is why using a thinly traded exchange like Gemini as the definitive BTC price measuring stick leaves the market open to price manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:45:31
It's not about making a "bet".  It's looking at the amount of current BTC in circulation and who owns the majority.  BTC did become "main stream" lately because it's all you hear about in the news.  I've been in BTC since 2013 (edit: then sold - then got back in later) and never have I heard a general conversation in public about it until the other day when I over heard 2 people talking about "setting up an account on Coinbase".  So when these people go in and buy coins at $18K+ and then lose that money inside of a day you better believe they will never touch BTC again.  Without them making all of the micro buys the whales will have only the old school BTC people and themselves.  The old school BTC'ers are all in the HODL camp and the whales know this.  So if there is little to no new blood coming into BTC then how do think that is going to affect the price of BTC?  Look at 99.99% of BTC trades.  They are micro trades that don't do a thing to the market.  Watch the video on the wall collapse during the run up to $20K.  There was a $13M dollar sell in that wall.  Better believe we are all being manipulated brother.  We can HODL all day long and the whales could care less.  We do not own the majority.  That's fact.

Here’s the unfortunate reality.  Now that Bitcoin is “mainstream” the end is near.  Whales will manipulate the market to buy up the last remaining amount of BTC in volume they can before their big exit.  It doesn’t matter if there are still 4 million BTC to be mined.  The whales are 100% controlling this price flux right now.  They are putting the squeeze on us all.  At one point I genuinely thought BTC would climb to over $25K but I’m doubtful now.  Too many noobs came into BTC and bought at $18K+ and freaked out and sold it back in the low $12s to $10s.  The whales gobbled up hordes of BTC.  This massive price drop has scared off an entire investor class. The whales are preparing for a mass exit.  I own a small chunk of BTC and am debating when to get out.  I do not know when but my gut tells me it’s relatively soon.  I truly wish I were wrong but I cannot shake this feeling lately.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:41:32
Yes.  You just described what the concern was all along.  This is exactly how futures markets can be easily manipulated and this is exactly what we are seeing.  I wrote about this in the CBOE post just before it went live.  
It's so easy for them.  Short futures contracts because you hold a massive number of coins across exchanges.  Begin slowly dumping coins then gradually increase unloading them to create a sell off.  Make a ton of money betting the price of BTC goes down then buy back all the low priced coins.  This is EXACTLY what is happening.

I was foolishly thinking to myself what a mastermind trading genius I was.  "I got out on top and the market tanked.  It will never rebound again.  Markets just don't do that.  It's impossible for BTC to come back."
Yeah...ok self.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:13:48
Yes, you are 100% correct.  This will always be the Achilles Heels for BTC.  The number one thing we need is mass adoption by businesses.  This would validate BTC as a replacement mechanism to the traditional banking system.  But as you said if we continue with increased fees and longer confirmation times then it will fail.  Regardless of how much people "believe" in BTC...it will fail.  I'm a HODLR for now but I'm also a realist that at some point the music will stop.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:03:07
Stop being a paranoid.  Try utilizing critical thinking and stop seeing your way out of a productive discussion by calling someone a troll.  If you have a more appropriate theory then by all means state it.  Enlighten me with your theory on how BTC goes to $100K.  Seriously...I want to hear it.

You don't understand a free market economy.  Regulation has nothing to do with a country being a free market or not.  Regulation is a means to ensure product or service quality, consumer protection, and fair business practices.  The US doesn't even come close the level of regulation like the EU.  They take regulation to an entirely different level.  
Regulation is necessary to a degree. Otherwise you have really shitty products, monopolies, price gauging, price fixing, etc.  Over regulation which stifles competition and organic growth is when it become insufferable.  The US is a free market economy and is guaranteed in our Constitution through the ownership of private property, competitive markets, and unregulated prices.

Wow.  I wonder how many others think crypto is like the stock market.  There is your first mistake.  For every sell of BTC there is a buy.  It's nothing more than people afraid of losing all of their money so they are willing to sell it at a cheaper price.  Then the next guy sells it cheaper still.  Then the next guy....etc...meanwhile there are equal and opposing buyers wiling to buy it at those cheaper prices because they want the BTC.  Then some of those guys know the panic selling is really going to drive the price to really cheap lows.  Just sell what you have buddy.  I'll buy it from you.

There are BUYERS, BUYERS, BUYERS all wanting to get cheap BTC.  Ask yourself "why would they want to buy BTC if the coin is "cratering"?"  If I really need to answer that question then please do not buy into BTC.  There is only 1 time...I repeat 1 time when I will have legitimate fear and dread.
