I have used the service of Anycoin Direct many times and I would recommend everyone In Europe to give it a try.

If you are from Europe I would recommend   it's really simple and they have great customer support.

I would recommend  They accept SEPA transfers and the customer support is great.

I use Anycoin Direct for a while now and buying bitcoin through them is super easy. You receive the coins instantly after you finish the order. Also the customer support is excellent :). If you are European I would recommend you give it a try and see for yourself.

Anycoin Direct is the fastest and easiest way to buy Bitcoin in Europe in my experience. I would recommend you give it a try.

I wouldn't invest all of it, i would invest an amount you can afford to lose. Going all in is risky but i have to say when you do it you do show you have big cojones :P.

I'm not related to Anycoin Direct. I just really like their service and have been using them for over a year now (before Anycoin they were Bitplaats). In my opinion their service and customer support are superior over any other service I have used. I just don't understand why there aren't more people are as excited about it as I am.

They have a lot of cool stickers. They also have altcoin stickers and you can pay in bitcoin or altcoin :D.

I know that feeling :P

I did't realize it would be considered annoying. I will keep it in mind. I was just trying to help other Europeans get an easy place to purchase Bitcoin.
