why are people still waiting for paypal? Half of the appeal of bitcoin for me is the need to not have to use paypal.

as someone who generally lives paycheck to paycheck, I'd love to not be constantly refreshing my bank page on payday because I need food.
(...or you know or I could stop spending where I don't need to heh)

Could be a scam. My guess is that he's taking a nap while waiting for the prices to skyrocket.

[Bitcoinin]( is a fantastic site with a lot of goods for sale for bitcoin
[Bitspend.net]( is a website that will organize the purchase of anything you want to buy online, [another user posted earlier about his purchase on bitspend](
[Bitmit]( aka. the ebay of bitcoin
Also there are apparently a lot of etsy shops taking it now.
Those are just a few that come to mind
EDIT: Fixed links, sorry at work at the moment pretending to be busy instead of bitlurking and watching dem charts :P

This kind of stuff is what makes gives me pleasure about bitcoins.
You know, there are people who are want bitcoins to succeed to be rich, there are people who are want bitcoins to succeed it for anarchistic reasons, there are people who are want bitcoins to succeed because it's a quick and convenient payment method online...
Personally I gain my hope that bitcoins will succeed because the Rockerfellas, Trumps and Murdochs of the world will likely be replaced with a bunch of 4channers and hilarious redditors who can retire and spend their time making videos like this that make me laugh. That thought alone gives me immense pleasure.
