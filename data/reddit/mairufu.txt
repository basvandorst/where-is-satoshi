I think its pretty good. Everyone has there own tastes. And shouldnt you be “woke” about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-14 05:31:17
I come from the future, btc hodl it. Dont be a dumb ass. Big peepee move. You will buy a bitcoin lambo then crash it for fun to buy another. Btc will dominate the world’s economy, you will be able to buy a house with it. You will rule the universe!!!
