I would never sell them all.  Just trickle them out to fiat as needed, preferably after 2020.

For now watch the core devs code then, download the codebase and get familiar with it, understand it.  After a few years of lurking you might have something to add.  And you will have a front row seat to the revolution of trust.

Good point.  I was in Japan recently and I saw the signs of BitCoin kind of popping up here and there, they are leading the way on this for sure.  But then they always have really, they have a different take on this stuff than we do.  The Japanese had smartphone payments going nationally as far back as 10 years ago.  I remember way back in 2003 they had a way to pay for things from vending machines and cashiers by just swiping your phone.  They don't hold back on stuff like this because it makes life easier and they respect that and adopt what works.  It makes sense that BitCoin would flourish in Asia first, plus there's the fact that it was conceived there.

This is how you rob a bank in the post-crypto world.  Let's hope he's using Multi-Sig...

Today I started thinking about how the HODL meme may be a major factor in the stabilization of BitCoin price. Seriously, it broadcasts a signal to many many people to stay the course, hang on be cool and let this thing grow up.  Sometimes when a sell vibe starts forming in my mind I will be wandering around the sub and I'm strongly reminded to hold, hold, hold.  It helps, it really does.  It centers me.  
I wonder where the price would be without the HODL meme.

That's swing trading and it is a very efficient way to lose your mind.

Easy to say now, but back then it was just another new thing that may or may not catch on.
