Glad to see progress, Storj folks. Have a cookie on me @_date: 2015-05-29 12:52:50
One big problem I see is that this would give greater voice to the wealthy and silence the poor. Let's say a downvote costs .01 BTC. That's peanuts to someone holding 200 BTC, but someone who can only afford 0.5 BTC isn't going to want to spend them on downvotes. So it would be a forum where the most upvoted content is heavily weighted on what appeals to the wealthy minority.
The nice part about reddit's voting system is that it's egalitarian: each person gets one vote regardless of whether they're rich, poor, high karma, fresh account, etc.

He's live streaming now:
He's alternating between posting frantic tweets / chats and casually playing online chess and browsing music on Tidal. I'm pretty sure he's just toying with everyone.
He also started trying to do traceroutes to daquan.com and daquan.net. There's no way Shkreli is actually that clueless.

I've contributed code to both projects. I feel like Sia's code is a lot cleaner and their development practices are more careful and deliberate.
Sia is also much farther ahead in terms of development. Storj is storing synthetic data that the miners generate themselves and there are no hosting contracts yet. Sia is already capable of allowing users to upload or host real data, backed by working data hosting contracts.
Both teams are pretty amiable based on their Slack channels and I wish luck to both.

It doesn't seem like you are a native English speaker, so a lot of the text contains errors or phrases that sound strange to a native speaker. For example, most English speakers would write "heart disease" rather than "heart diseases." Also instead of "metabolism rate" it's more common to just say "metabolism" though your text is not technically wrong. Consider hiring a copy editor in /r/Jobs4Bitcoins
