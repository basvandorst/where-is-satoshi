That's exactly what i mean.

I would assume not a lot of the "advanced tech" is hardware based, as many seem to assume. It's all software. Intelligence agencies have incredible software that would never see that light of day as a consumer product, because it's not meant as such.

Wow. I feel like I really screwed the pooch on that last bullet point... ����‍♂️

$100 is not all I had at my disposal, it's what I felt comfortable spending at this time. This is all new to me. Please forgive me if my "investment" amount is not up to your standards.

If you use your bank account to buy on Coinbase it takes up to 8 days. If you use a debit/credit card it's instant but you can only purchase a maximum of $200 at a time and I think the fee is higher.

It's encrypted, but essentially, yes.

I will do that as soon as the coins are in my Coinbase account (takes 5-8 days for coins to be available after bank transfer). Any recommendations on good wallets?

Gee thanks. Lol. I've been reading a lot.

So how do you expect this will effect the future of BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:39:24
Should be able to. I just went through the setup process for my Electrum wallet and that is what it said during setup.

Is it worth it to do all that with so little invested? I only have $100 worth at this point, but I suppose if I continue to buy then I'll want to safe net my investment some way. I don't really have any other investments at this point. I've though about creating an investment portfolio before, but first I need the disposable income to start lol.

This is day one for me lol

So, I'm new here (to bitcoin and the sub), but I know that Satoshi Nakamoto implemented the 1MB block size for exactly the reason the guy in OPs link was talking about, to keep the network from DoS with spam transactions. So, increasing the block size effectively increases that risk. I know that the number of transactions has grown exponentially since the 1MB was implemented and caused backlogging of transactions on the network, thus, SegWit2x was implemented. My question is why are so many people pro block size increase with this obvious DoS vulnerability such a high risk, instead of attempting to develops a way to both increase transaction speeds and decrease block size? Or do I not understand the actual problem? (I am still new to this.)

I bought in a few days ago.. definitely my fault.

I'm new to bitcoin and this was an amazingly interesting read. I hope there is a way in the future to incentivize miners for the maintenance of the sidechain as that seems to be vital to the SegWit architecture.

When you say diversify, what exactly does that mean?
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:56:52
Lol. How'd that work out?
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:37:54
I don't even know what lisk and ripple are. I feel like I might be a little late to the party, but I'm here now. I definitely continue to read and learn!

Right now, I'm looking at the money I spend on bitcoin the same way I look at spending money on something frivolous. I won't spend more than i can afford to lose. I plan to buy more in the coming weeks and months, but as you've said, never more than a couple hundred at a time. Money that if lost would make me sad, but wouldn't put me in a financial crisis.

How did they do that? Did you not use a mixer?
