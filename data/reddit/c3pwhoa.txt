Send money to an exchange. Buy bitcoin. Price goes up. Sell bitcoin. Send money from exchange to your account. Congratulations you just made money buying and selling bitcoin.
As for uses: in future crypto will be an instant and fee free way of transferring value. Imagine sending 10k from China to London instantly without worrying about contacting banks, fees or delays. You have complete control of the transaction from start to finish, and the whole thing is secure.
Mining: you are searching for solutions to problems in blocks. You find the solution, you get a reward and the blockchain gets longer. The reward is 25 bitcoins and solutions are mined by huge clusters of computers working together. To mine one today with your home PC would take years.

Governments won't have a choice, they don't control it. That's part of the point.
Are you asking me if anyone in a market valued at 250+ billion dollars has made money selling bitcoin on an exchange? Are you really fucking asking that? Jesus man I'm trying to help you out but that's a really stupid question.
Regarding value in terms of dollars: markets determine value. If people are prepared to pay 100 for something and no more, then it's worth 100. Crypto markets have huge numbers of participants and the price rises and falls in response to supply and demand.

Absolutely. I hate seeing shit like post on reddit because it really drives home how much naive desperation sits behind each purchase. 
"Oh golly gee guys a big buy wall the price is going up!" 
To the 'chart savants' of reddit: unless you are a significant whale, have genuine inside information, or the trend is extremely blatant (i.e the sky is falling), you most likely have no fucking clue what's going on. You are watching games unfold on exchanges which could have any number of motivations, none of which you are privy to. You have strapped yourself to a wayward rocket that's currently going sideways. Until the rocket explodes or reaches whatever moon you're aiming to land on embrace the chaos and stop trying to make sense of it.

So say you owned Enron shares with a nice rating (which they had), or you were invested in a .com company in the 90s which went under, or countless other failed company shares, then what? You think Enron shareholders got their money back? No, they got fucked.
You have a striking lack of understanding of the value of cryptocurrencies and why they are booming. A currency that you can send anywhere at any time, securely, with minimal transaction fees and no third party interference has value. There are many other useful applications - blockchain based apps, smart contracts, automated nanotransactions and more. Before long we will have instant, fee free transactions that can be securely made to anyone in the world and used to purchase virtually anything. Even as merely a store of value it is useful in the same way gold is today. People in Venezuela are using and mining bitcoin because their national currency is failing them.
Your argument about hedging is what exactly? Sure if you put everything into bitcoin it's unwise. Just as putting everything into one company is unwise. Diversify your portfolio. People are now hedging *into* bitcoin against other markets. Stocks or FOREX aren't better in this regard.
If you want to go on believing bitcoin is a magic internet money bubble, go for it. In time you'll be using a crypto currency in your daily life and perhaps you'll reflect on this conversation and wonder why you thought stocks were solid and bitcoin was not.

It would only be worth nothing if people didn't want it. People want it which is why it's worth something, and in many cases it's wanted precisely because it's a store of value that can't be directly controlled by governments. Also, my comment about a game of chicken relates to trading securities generally - the fact that a government might bailout a bank to prevent complete financial collapse doesn't mean your apple shares will be valuable tomorrow. Collective agreement gives tradeable things like shares and currency value just as it does bitcoin.

Here is the CEO of Goldman Sachs explaining how he could understand bitcoin to be part of the natural evolution of money if it were to be successful in the future:
Listening to him might help you better understand what money is.
The world's largest financial company CME has recently announced they will open trading of bitcoin to customers alongside other commodities like gold, and here is an article from CNBC discussing hedge funds that have included bitcoin in their investments:


Bitcoin is one part of a porfolio. You diversify by having different investments. How are you not understanding this.


If it's not an investment why the fuck are hedgefunds investing in it, Goldman Sachs considering investing in it, CME group opening futures trading for it. You've ignored all the use cases I've stated for it.
It is probably a bubble. I didn't say it wasn't. But so was the .com bubble, and the price of Amazon shares are now 10x what they were *before* that bubble popped. 
I doubt you'll look at what I've said or actually try to understand the use cases for bitcoin, but whatever. Stay stubborn and see where that gets you.

All financial markets are basically big games of chicken.

Oh right, unlike all the banks held accountable for trading subprime mortgages bundled into complex financial instruments, gotcha.

I said it tracks bitcoin. It does. I said it's a publicly listed company. The XBT provider is a publicly listed company. He said anyone who 'trades bitcoin'.
You're not your.

You're talking about "slipping in code" into some of the most reviewed code in the world without anyone noticing. A lot of things are theoretically possible - that doesn't make them genuine risks.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:02:28
They aren't buying bitcoin, they're buying shares in a publicly listed company that deals in tracking bitcoin. The inference is that you wouldn't buy into a bitcoin related company if you thought bitcoin was a sham. There are a huge number of valid reasons you might, however, and after looking at this more it feels like a whole lot of bitcoin zealots getting excited over nothing.

From that thread:

No one is questioning the value of skepticism man. Most people here, whether they admit it or not, have a whole bunch of quiet skepticism. What's in question is whether JP Morgan is trying to manipulate the market through negative press. Personally I think the volumes aren't really great enough to be smoking gun, but who knows.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:45:28
JP say: bitcoin is fraud
But JP name in purchaser section?
So what does JP think? Does she love me or not?
So hurt and confused. Post about manipulation on reddit.

Bitcoin Headquarters where you'll find the founder and CEO John Bitman. Hopefully the security team is well prepared for such scenarios.

If you set your sell order at 9000, and the price drops below 9000, it won't sell. A huge wall of sell orders can force the market sideways, but if what you say is true (it isn't) there's no immediate reason the market would tank due to sell orders being set at 9k.
