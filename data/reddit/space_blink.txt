I don't understand, I though blocks are found ~every 10 minutes?

Looks like revenge porn so it makes sense.

So the 5 guys using bitcoin told their friends, and now ~11 people decided to invest. We need more numbers to determine if Greece is actually doing anything.

I doubt they got over $100MM in funding for vaporware. I expect big things out of this hardware company.

In time, I predict bitcoin mining to be a lot more competitive to the point where bitcoin mining goes completely off grid in terms of power consumption. It's just a matter of when since sources such as solar will only get cheaper. As for internet connection, SpaceX is working on connecting the globe from space.

Haha, thanks! Yeah the google docs version should have all the same formulas, but I don't think the price updater from coinbase works on it though.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:59:06
I have the price linked to coinbase's website which updates every 30 minutes if that's what you mean. It's on the next tab labeled BTC Price Query. Is there a simple way to move this over to google documents?

Thank you! [Here's the link](
Although now my pretty colors and bars are gone, haha. I'll play around with this to see what things I'm able to do with it. 
Not as simple and pretty as excel so I'll stick to that but feel free to use the google doc if that's all you have.

From above, I made a [google docs version]( Not sure how I could verify my excel document as legit, so that's up to you guys I suppose. 
But yeah, I would be cautious as well with any document I wanted to download online, so hopefully more tech savvy people can review and verify the document. I seem to have changed mind so there's one possible source of verification.
For what it's worth, it's just a simple excel 2013 spreadsheet with a few calculations and a link to coinbase's bitcoin price. I'm just looking for ways to make it better with more analytics tools. I really suck at trying to make readable graphs with these numbers. I'm having trouble making a simple month to month bar graph to show me how much money I'm spending on bitcoin using the already given data.

Get ready for the big times boys. Looks like amateur trading hour is over. Very bullish news.

You would have to walk me though what you mean since I have never used github. 
I'm pretty sure all of the formulas would be visable with google sheets though, which is posted in one of my comments here, and in my new post.

This really wouldn't be useful just yet for me, but for when I eventually use Bitcoin for everyday purchases, I would like a wallet where I can customize a budget. For example, every payday, I deposit all my money into one address which will then split up my paycheck into my predefined budget. $1000 worth goes for rent and utilities, 5% off what's left for eating out, 10% for groceries, 5% savings, 5% for entertainment, etc. This would be a great way to visualize and track your budgeting.
