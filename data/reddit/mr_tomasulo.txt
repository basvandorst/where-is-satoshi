I got free BCash from the fork and immediately converted it to Bitcoin.

I like to see these posts.  Using Bitcoin for what is what meant for.  That is when something has value.  Not hording it and watching the price.

I got free BCash coins from the fork which I promptly sold for Bitcoins, so I will always be grateful to BCash for the free money.

Stupid, delusional morons.  Hoarding Bitcoin does nothing.  Something is of value when people use it, not hoarding it and watching the price artificially inflate.
If you are not already rich from Bitcoin, you probably never will be.
Also, own 4 Bitcoins so I'm not being subjective.  I'd love for the price to rise to $100,000 a Bitcoin but it has to be done right or you'll just get another crash like last year.

Excellent analysis. /s

and this is why no one who isn't already rich will probably never be rich from crypto.  Something has value when people use it.  Hoarding Bitcoins and watching the price does nothing to increase its value.

If you're not already rich from Bitcoin you probably never will be or anytime soon.  Anyone who got rich did from the bubble last year.  Hoarding a currency will never make it valuable.  Something is of value when people use it.  Don't give me that "store of value" BS.  Only way Bitcoin rises in real value, and not people artificially inflating it, is if it's used to buy and sell things and we are a long way from that.
People compare Bitcoin now to the early Internet.  The problem with the comparison is that people didn't have to convert their real money into a highly-volatile, virtual currency to use the Internet.  No way you get Mom and Pop Joe Public to convert their savings into Bitcoin.

I'll take losers who missed the boat and are in denial about getting rich without working for it.

If you're not already rich from Bitcoin, you probably never will be or anytime soon where you can enjoy it.

what a bunch of losers.  if you're not already rich from Bitcoin you never will be.  You missed the boat.
