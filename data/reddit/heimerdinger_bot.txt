A bitcoin miner was hacked for $60 million, and to the mainstream that means the same thing.

I was being sarcastic... :)
Who in their right mind would complain about losing 2k off their 12k gain.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:28:01
Lmao. "The more I look at it the more it flip flops around and I know I can't do anything and I'm not gonna sell anyway but god damnit I can't stop looking. It goes up and down and up and down and I just stare at it. At work, at home, I can't stop. I open up an internet browser and its become habit to type "btc usd". I need help."
I might know the feeling.

what the hell are vegeta graphics
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:04:34
What ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:55:21
Everyone should tip me for giving the warning :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:49:38
Good look
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:39:38
Do you understand how many people still thought I was being serious?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:44:52
Interesting. You've sold then?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:52:47
The issue is, nobody thinks bitcoin has reached its peak yet. There's no new paradigm.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:54:17
I accept donations for giving the warning
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:49:10
Did you really make 2 accounts for this lmao
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:49:38
woah woah woah lets not be ridiculous now ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:54:08
I have no other option unfortunately to deposit Canadian at cheap rates. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:57
Ok, I'll look into quadriga, and let you know. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:00
whats this a reference to? Was he the one who said it would never reach 10k?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:47
A bunch of reasons, such as not being able to use GDAX based on location.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:26:46
Is it cheap?
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:35:45
Damn, they're at $9600 CAD vs ~9030 CAD on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:05
I have outrage against Gemini and Coinbase. Also somewhat Kraken.
Rip: That says outages, not outrage. I am outraged cause they're down.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:46
But it's back xd
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:07
I found him funny.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:04
Well, they make a fuckton of money off of it, so they're not exactly saints.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:02
HOW. What do you use?
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:36:57
Is paying 7% more than market value a thing? Wow. :|
They're selling at like 9649 CAD.
Canadian bitcoins is at $9800... 
the fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:42:08
Thats what I figured lmao.
All these Canadian bitcoin places are so expensive. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:25
90% of people don't have the option to buy. All major exchanges going down isn't exactly good for investment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:18
How bad was their outage today?
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:06:20
Will do! Thanks a lot.
What do you think of gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:50
man fuck coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:26:22
Is it cheap?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:19
Did you have an issue where they sent you your verification email, but it still said you were pending on their website? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:35:39
What other sources do you use for bitcoin then? (Am canadian)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:42
Did quadriga have a scandal recently?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:15:30
"a lil upset" is where I'm at right now -.-
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:27:11
coinbase ain't back anywhere unless you gotta admin password
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:07
Honestly, could just be them trying to make their own money. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:19:05
lmao, fuck coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:38:07
Fair enough, thanks! 
Is paying ~7% over market value for bitcoins common place too?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:44:00
Oh my god I'm dumb af, you're right.
Side note: was there a delay between your verification email and the website updating?
