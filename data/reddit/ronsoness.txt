thanks. it was worth a shot. as for domains for sale, typically, i would just try and find an alternative... they usually have quite a premium on them, when there are plenty of other decent alternatives. it's incredibly cheap to park a domain, so it's not bad for owners to make a large ask, park it, then sit and wait. kinda of like bitcoin :).

hello, i'm very curious about the future of bitcoin. i know there are lots of people who think it's worthless garbage and it's a bubble, but i think as an alternative to fiat, esp for countries with currency volatility, i think it has great value. my question is:
1) do you think btc can be used as currency in the future? it's very volatile, so i've heard it's more of a store of value or a speculative thing, but if it stabilizes, do you see it being currency for normal people (and not silk road cases)?
2) what do you think of Facebook coin? 
3) i've heard about bitcoin having fairly long transaction compared to XRP, Paypal, Visa. thoughts?

holy cow yes you're right... also i'm not sure what made the person think btc would tumble... the binance hack? personal accounts not affected. would've been better to just buy dips. some people live life on the edge.

I just added a sample meme. But I was also downvoted. Users may never see this post. Lol.

I would say it can be incredibly simple. There are generators out there where you can use their templates. In terms of quality though and going viral, that's where I believe it requires a bit more "craft". There are definitely lots of bad memes. The good ones we see are usually recycled/reposted (pretty much the equivalent of a reddit upvote). I like memes because they are like a Sunday comic, where you have a challenge of showing an idea with sometimes just one picture and some text.

wow, that's a great idea! thanks for the suggestion. i am offering a custom meme service, whether someone wants a meme about the us-china tariff, game of thrones, avengers, the nba, dollar stores, life in texas, etc.
