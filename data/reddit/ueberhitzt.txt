It means simply that 1756 futures contracts were traded but it doesn't provide any information about net buying or selling. At the end of the day, each account's buys and sells are netted out. So it could be on net 1756 net new transactions. It could have the economic effect that 1756 contracts will be delivered against on delivery day later in November, but it likewise means that 1756 contracts were sold. Volume number is purely neutral relative to price. However, the great bulk of futures contracts (like 95% or more) are offset and not delivered against at all. For example, on Thursday, 714 futures contracts were traded but on net, 41 some positions were closed - open interest went down by 41 or so contracts.
By the way, these are futures contracts. You can sell futures on bitcoin until the cows come home without ever even having a single Satoshi. Likewise you can but futures on bitcoin without ever knowing what a wallet is.

eh? where do your short/long numbers come from?

It is hard to predict open interest from trading volume. For example, on Thursday the volume was 714 contracts but open interest went down 41 from the day before. We don't know what the open interest was after Friday's record trading.
Bakkt has nothing to do with open interest until the futures stop trading. Then Bakkt has to start taking in bitcoin from the shorts on the futures to deliver to the longs.
Futures trade on ICE which is a federally regulated market and the futures are cleared on ICE Clear US, a federally regulated clearinghouse. Bakkt is not federally licensed, has a state license.
Due to their license from NY State, you can only put bitcoin in Bakkt if you are making delivery. They should right now have about zero on deposit because, even if you absolutely know you are going to deliver on the contract, you would keep it where it is until you have to move it. For each futures contract, you have to put up 37% of the value to ICE at the very absolute minimum. If Bakkt's daily delivering futures were traded then you would have stuff moving in and out every day.

Bakkt options are options on futures . You receive/deliver a futures contract if you exercise/are exercised. You can only exercise at option expiration, two days before futures expiration.

ICE/Bakkt is paying market makers and "liquidity providers" to trade. You could start qualifying for the payments in late October - October 23 which is the day that volume hit 550 contracts for the first time. 
There shouldn't be a lot of BTC in the Bakkt warehouse because you are only allowed to put BTC in there if you are going to use it to deliver. It is in their Bitlicense and in the fine print on the website.

don't trust bots. the number of contracts that they submitted to their clearinghouse was only 590. I have seen the Bakktbot be wrong before. Who is behind it? The real numbers are here: [
