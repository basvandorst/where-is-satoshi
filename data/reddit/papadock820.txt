So what?

LOL, so what? Money is free speech too. You guys really jump through hoops pretending you don't have to pay taxes.

Not to sound like a dick, but who told you that? The people that were oblivious to the bug for years?

So you want businesses to take steps backwards, and have to not only manually verify each transaction, but to manually record each transaction in their record book/accounting software? It's bad enough we have to do this with cash.

Why? Never heard of this, there's no functional difference between an uncirculated coin and circulated coin.

lol, you should never be hardcoding secret keys in the first place. That's what environmental variables are for. Lesson learned the hard way I guess

This is a more viable solution in some instances. 
But still doesn't solve the liability issue if faced with fraud or transaction problems. Also the fact that most people can't keep track of passwords let alone keys.


You don't have to do software updates on a regular cash register, but I get your point

Easy enough for a person familiar with computer programming to do it, but that doesn't mean it'll be implemented securely. Not all programmers are security experts. You're also forgetting you also have to connect Bitcoind to whatever accounting software is used. 
But you can't expect every mom and pop shop to have a person on staff who can program. They can pay someone else to implement it, but then they'd also have to pay them to maintain/update it. Meaning they'd either have to pay perpetually to maintain it, or hire staff who can program.
But then, you're adding more liability to the mom and pop shop. With traditional point of sale systems via third parties, liability for transaction problems falls on the company providing services. What you're suggesting is the shop hold liability themselves since they will be the ones creating any type of Bitcoin system.
You're essentially making it more expensive and time consuming to accept Bitcoin. This is why third-party payment processors exist in the first place. To offload liability, and offload technical processing requirements of accepting a currency.
As a business owner, I don't want to worry about programming interfaces to accept Bitcoin, I just want to run my business. And I'm a programmer myself, but I'd rather use BitPay.

Pick one.


You still don't quite get it. You shouldn't have to add files individually. You should be using environmental variables.
Your keys should be no where near your repo. Like, at all. You should have the keys loaded into memory from a file outside, preferably in a file owned by a user that doesn't run the app or git. And your application should use the variables.

Interesting, I'll take a look at it.

Well, we learn from out mistakes.

Not sure what country you're from, but in the US, Lawyers don't have the authority to freeze accounts, neither do law enforcement. You'd need a Judge.
By the time he get's a lawyer to contact law enforcement to do an investigation to get a court order, the money will probably be gone.
