Here's an example of why having inflation at a government's disposal is a handy tool - specially tailored for the reddit demographic!
Imagine you have tons of people drowning in student debt (which cannot be discharged in bankruptcy) - how can you help solve it? Manage the money supply to create higher inflation.
Student A borrows $10,000 in year 0 money, after 10 years the debt is denominated in the same dollars, but the buying power of those dollars is reduced. 
So salaries and prices rise to reflect the new reality under 10 years of inflation but historic debts remain fixed - the debt obligation on the students is the same when measured in dollars, but is easier to pay because the dollars borrowed are worth less in today's dollars.

I hear ya - definitely not always good, but a good option to hold in your back pocket if ever needed. 
Fiat money has lots of components about it that provide flexibility, for instance with bitcoin you're basically locked in to a deflationary currency, which removes options from the table

I'm in Canada so don't deal with us taxes - but my understanding is that the $3k limit is for applying losses to other forms (i.e. non-capital) income.
For instance, if you have a $1000 gain on a trade and a $1000 loss you would not to $0 and have no capital gain to report. 
If you had a $1000 gain and a $5000 loss then you would have a capital loss of $4,000 - in the first year you could deduct $3,000 from other forms of income and carry the $1,000 forward into the next tax year

Agreed, there are many topics here being conflated and talked about as one thing.
If things cost more today it is due to inflation which means there is more money floating around (money supply goes up), which would logically mean that wages go up. 
However in the example above it was stated that wages didn't move - so why is that? Not because of the increase in the money supply, which would have the opposite effect
