I don't think this was that radical of a concept in the 90s. A lot of people had the dream of electronic payments, many alternative currencies have been invented, and the desire for anonymity in spending is also not new. The unification of these ideas into digital cash isn't that interesting.
Bitcoin is interesting and radical because it's the first system to make this workable as a decentralized system.

Nope. That only works because the economy has been in boom this entire time. When we have a real recession and people lose jobs and need liquidity, that HODL shit doesn't work. Those expecting uncorrelated behavior are in for quite a shock.

I don't invest in dollars. I use them as money, holding some out of investments in case of personal emergency. They work shockingly well for this.

If the USD collapses, finding your private key will be the least of your worries. I'd hodl beans and ammunition if I felt the need to hedge against USD collapse.

Crypto already crashed. But also, we haven't had a full on crisis yet. Just turbulence in the stock market. I hypothesize that decorrelation may hold in a reasonably healthy economy but that it will definitely not in a recession.

But wait, I thought the whole economy was moving to crypto. What's "sell" mean?

I'm not sure if you know this, but the treasury would simply print all the cash to represent all of the balances. The banks would give people the cash. Then people would be like, "well, I guess everything's okay, and maybe holding all this cash is a bad idea". Within about a week, that cash is back in bank vaults, then back to the Fed, then into a furnace.
This lesson was learned in the 1930s when the runs on the banks led to a fundamental rethinking of central banking practice.
