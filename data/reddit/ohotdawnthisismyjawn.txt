This is the concept of "picking up nickels in front of a steam roller".  Lots of small, easy profits until the day it all gets wiped out, either from market risk (like this) or counterparty risk (you get goxed)
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:03:27
No one is saying anyone got goxed right now.  The point is that people have lots of trading strategies that return some small amount and discount the risk of black swan events.  Examples of black swan events are large market moves against you or the failure of a counterparty.

Yeah this comes up a lot in arbitrage.  People notice that there's a $400/coin difference between two exchanges and think that they can make a ton of free money.  What they don't count on is that after fees and everything, the percent they make on each trade is very small, and there's a reason that the difference exists.  You make $10/day until the day the exchange goes down at the same time you're trying to get out and now all your profit is wiped out plus more.

Do this BEFORE you cash out!!  Once you have triggered the taxes there's not much an (honest) accountant can do.  They're much more useful as an advisor to which actions you should take.

The problem is that NFLX makes a lot of money from people who just set up recurring billing and then never cancel.  If people have to take ANY action to pay then NFLX will lose a TON of money from those passive users.  
Recurring billing is the holy grail of consumer companies for this reason.

This is generally considered "automatic investing" and not DCA.  It's a technicality but the idea is to differentiate between investing a lump sum over time to lower volatility (caps upside, generally bad if you think the investment is going to appreciate) and investing a part of each paycheck (good, generally  the choice is usually between investing a little at a time and not investing at all).

Technically if you're doing it as part of each paycheck you're doing "automatic investing".  Dollar cost averaging specifically refers to breaking up a lump sum into smaller parts to reduce volatility.

If that were true then no one would ever play the slot machines with worse edges or 6:5 BJ when 3:2 is also available.
You saw the same thing at online poker rooms - the ones with the lowest rake were not the ones that had the most action.
Gambling is a very emotional thing and people don't make rational decisions based on stuff like house edge - otherwise no one would gamble at all.
@_date: 2016-01-31 18:43:01
People do not gamble rationally; if they did then no one would ever gamble.
You're talking about emotion and things like "this table looks like it's about to get lucky" or "I like the graphics on this slot machine."  The average person doesn't even understand house edge or statistics or probability or the gambler's fallacy or anything else that would make them care.
So now you're competing against online casinos that can spend a lot more on marketing because they're actually making a profit off the games.

I think his concern is that you won't be able to tell which chain you're looking at or sending from and it's possible that it will flip back and forth.  Advanced users will be able to pin to a specific chain but many users aren't going to know what's going on.
Has there been any thought about making it clear in the wallet which chain you're looking at or sending from?

You wouldn't try to claw the money back after it had been paid out. Instead you would do something like put chunks of money in escrow to be released upon certain conditions being met.  Or the seller could receive all of the money upfront and then pay a fee to an insurance company to put up a bond which would then work the same as an escrow.
Then the escrow release can be setup so that "money is released with no further action unless a trusted third-party indicates there was a problem" or you could do the opposite and say that "money is returned to buyer unless a trusted third-party indicates that there were no problems found."
But I'm not an ETH/smart contract expert
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:07:43
I am guessing he means that with ETH you could attach some contractual terms to your payment (e.g. house passes inspection, house stays free of mold for 3 years, house doesn't collapse in the first 5 years, whatever).  With a smart contract you could get your money back for the house or impose different kinds of refunds based on different kinds of problems that come up, and you could have built in escrow.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:15:32


Which is still mostly fine.  What OP is talking about is "$1 per $100 sent" or "10 satoshi per BTC".  Both of those metrics are useless because that's not how fees are calculated.  You could send $1B for $0.10 if the transactions aligned.

I agree but there's a big range for what constitutes financial independence.  If you're expecting to never work again then $1mm is not going to cut it unless you want to move to a developing country or live a very spartan lifestyle.  
For people who have a well-paying job and a lot of earning years ahead of them it might make sense to hold and press for "fuck you money" vs. cashing out a million right now and ending up with a slightly more comfortable life.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:51:04
1% on $4mm is $40k/year.   Doable if you're frugal but far from any kind of luxury.

SHA is not an encryption algorithm, it's a hashing algorithm (well, a family of hashing functions).    One way function.  Can't be reversed.   You wouldn't want to use SHA256 to encrypt anything because you'd never be able to decrypt it.

And in countries where savings accounts pay a lot of interest it's because there's high inflation. 
It's all about risk adjusted returns.  A savings account with no risk is never going to give you high real returns.

Meh I think this is a really bad description of it.  This kind of trading is not nefarious, which is what calling it "a legal form of insider trading" sounds like.  In fact, it's the entire purpose of the public markets.  Google trading on their search data is basically them getting paid for sharing what they have learned.  Markets become more efficient because they take more data into account.
Also, Eric Schmidt said they considered doing this kind of thing on top of aggregated/anonymized search data but decided not to.

I don't think it would be possible even if they wanted to.  Your account at the gambling site should have its own personal address that you deposit into.  Coinbase would have no way of knowing whether that address belongs to an account at a gambling site or it's just someone's personal wallet.

The clearing time is a feature, not a bug.  It allows accidental or fraudulent transactions to be reversed.  Building additional services on top that take the credit risk lets you move money fast when/if you need to take the risk without forcing everyone to use an instant transfer.

As long as you need to buy things with USD you'll have to exchange your BTC for USD relatively quickly.  Otherwise you're still playing the forex game as long as you hold onto BTC.
This will become less of an issue as more places accept BTC and you can do things like enter long term supply contracts with a rate set in BTC instead of USD.  But until you can do all your commerce in BTC, pricing your goods in USD and accepting the equivalent BTC doesn't do you any good against the volatility.
