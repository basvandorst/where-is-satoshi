Bitcoin losing nearly half its market cap within a three month period is true, and it’s also true that it only hit the mainstream media around the time it was at its highest so from an objective investor or someone analysing the risks of crypto as a lender it entirely makes sense. 
It’s fine to get me on the semantics of a three month period but to just miss the point I’m making is a little silly.

Bitcoin lost nearly 50% of its market cap in 3 months, at around the time that mainstream interest in crypto currency really became solid.
Anything crypto right now would not be considered acceptable risk for a bank to invest in.

Just wait till the bubble bursts, you'll hear it a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:25:37
So we agree this is a bubble?

Except commodities assets and goods have an inherent value beyond the market or the speculation. Anyone can argue these things might have an inflated value or bubble, but at least there is an intrinsic value or use for them.
The same cannot be said for bitcoin. It is a bunch of speculators walking around naked because nobody wants to acknowledge the emperors new clothes as what they are.

If you short a dollar worth of bitcoin you can only make a dollar.
I’m not sure you understand how shorting works.
If you ‘short’ a dollar of bitcoin you are borrowing that much worth of bitcoin to pay back, in bitcoin, later, so if the value of bitcoin drops you don’t have to spend a dollar to buy that much bitcoin to pay back to the lender.
Shorting only works if you have a bit of money to begin with.

Property prices may become inflamed, but it has inherent value

Nope, it's a firesale.

That’s just plainly false.
I don’t need anybody to agree with me on the value of the contents of my fridge for them to be worth something to me, they provide sustenance and have intrinsic value.
Raw materials are the same, they don’t require a group of people all agree that it has value for it to have inherent value, because it can be used and valuable whether you agree or not. Property is the same.
The only thing providing value to bitcoin is the collective agreement by people buying them that they are valuable.
Intrinsic value exists, maybe just not in your portfolio

Because not everyone has the means to do so.

But surely as the technology progresses they’ll... and it’s gone.

Except you’re responding to someone talking about ecological impacts.
The environment doesn’t run off a balance sheet

And this is why economists are always accused of seeing bubbles afterwards.
Before a bubble there's no way to prove it is, so it's easily dismissed by those caught up in it.
