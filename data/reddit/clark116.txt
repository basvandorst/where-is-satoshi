YOU HAVE TO USE THE APP.
Yes. I got stuck, went through tech-support mazes (got no help) and eventually figured it out. It sucks, and they should really fix it.
They want to take a pic of your face, to match it up after ID upload. Funny thing is...
The website doesn't DO THAT PART. COINBASE!!!
Spread the news! =)

**Use the Mobile app** -- after snapping pic of ID, it asks for pic of face. Had same issue, now 100% verified. =)

It's going to be pretty tricky for you, because all the BTC ATMs require a photo ID to comply with [AML/CTF laws.](
Maybe look into trading with a local person, something like [localbitcoins.com]( or something.
