I agree in the current opt in form it changes little. Merchants can simply wait a confirmation when accepting transactions flagged RBF. 
But within days of the change being implemented Todd started pushing for full RBF implementation. Will the community have any say if that is enabled in the next Core release?

@_date: 2016-03-11 19:51:16
You are right about it being control over bitcoin development, but you are entirely wrong about the motivation - which is precisely about scaling bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-11 19:28:57
The company Blockstream has been funded with 75million USD and employs several Core developers.
Those developers want bitcoin to become a settlement network and proposes scaling bitcoin through an optimisation called SegWit which can be implemented via a soft network fork. 
Not everyone agrees with this approach as it seems to be different to what Satoshi originally proposed in his white paper. On the other side of the debate are supporters of alternate newer bitcoin node clients which support greater block sizes than 1mb (the limit for Core nodes) and theoretically support higher transaction counts via direct on chain scaling.
The argument has led to furious acrimony between camps as it is essentially a power struggle over ideology for bitcoin in the next 5 years and also decides who holds the keys to bitcoin development over the same time period.
The ecosystem is holding it's collective breath over what happens next - either a hard fork to newer bitcoin clients with on chain scaling or shift in direction towards a settlement network instead with additional payment layers built over the top.

The problem you chaps have to explain away is why anyone is going to keep investing in a digital currency running at full capacity with a fee market in place.
Bitcoin has speculative value based to an extent upon expectation of user growth in the future. We caught a glimpse of what happens when the network reaches saturation last week.
EDIT: and to make it absolutely clear to you. Failure of bitcoin to move back to it's original design through removal of this artificial cap at 1mb via whatever route necessary heralds the end of the bitcoin project we all know, likely through a massive value transfer to chains which do flexibly scale (most of the new ones) or by ending this recent craze with private digital money entirely for years to come in the future.
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:22:58
Fair enough. But 75 million USD doesn't get a return from consulting and doesn't need the network to change economic model. Storage is cheap and of all the concerns we have I think that is the least pressing given 200gb sd cards are 100$.

What a strawman argument. Has keeping bitcoin ahead of transaction demand led to data centers over the last seven years? Why would increasing the blocksize to 2mb (or even 4 or 8) lead to that? Silly and wrongheaded scaremongering. This kind of prattle is why all intellectual debate left this subreddit long ago for warmer climes.

Yeah but it isn't hard to see that blockstream aim to make money through lightning and investors have pumped in $75 million USD which isn't chump change. 
I can forsee that what eventually transpires is an agreement between miners and blockstream over compensatory fees. With the vast majority of transactions being done abstracted a layer above lightning channels, entirely off chain for all intents and purposes. What worries me is that it may allow fractional reserves to build up and circumvent the hard 21 million cap we all respect. Looking into the far future they could just sever the link with the base layer entirely.

Patience grasshopper. The market finds solutions. Either we fork to a client without the obstructions built in or the value evaporates away. But these things tend to happen rather unexpectedly and just a little bit quicker than you are able to respond to when they do occur.
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:14:11
It certainly isn't trivial to double spend 0-conf transactions - in fact the opposite is true. 
Simply waiting a few short seconds limits the chance of a double spend to a negligible risk and for all low value transactions it is entirely safe. 
You can keep saying 0-conf doesn't work but the entire ecosystem knows otherwise.
The true goal of all this 0-conf isn't safe bullshit is to try and encourage only high value transactions and usage of bitcoin as a settlement network. Wankers.
@_date: 2016-03-06 15:17:16
No. You can continue to lie about this, but that and other posts clearly demonstrate the thinking in 2010 (six years ago) about why the limit was put in place.
It certainly wasn't put in place to stop people transacting on the network or to limit bitcoin to natural growth.

Which is the same thing :) 
If you make on chain transactions expensive then either everyone leaves and value flows to other chains or everyone uses bitcoin abstracted one layer removed as in lightning or another payment system built on bitcoin. 
What I struggle with is how they expect to go from everyone using the main chain with ultra cheap transactions to everyone using lightning because it is cheaper. That needs to be more clearly explained. Also how are miners going to recoup income as the block reward exponentially decays if transactions are performed off chain and only written to the chain during closing of channels? It seems like blockstream will have to convince miners that they will pay enormous transaction fees to close channels from their hubs to make up for what was originally intended - growing transaction fees from vast numbers of little fees instead.

I think that calling the current situation a success is utterly absurd when value is flowing right now into alternative blockchains.
There is a concept called listening to the customer and woe betide any developer of an open source project who think they know better than the majority of the userspace.
My personal view as a long time bitcoin user and holder is that this is a real existential crisis for bitcoin, a Minsky moment. 
Either the miners get their act together and are seen to actively and unequivocally support an immediate scaling solution and begin to implement such support, or investors will begin to pack up and move on, to quote Hemingway, 'gradually, and then suddenly'.
The market is signalling it's intentions now. Either this governance issue threatening to freeze the bitcoin network with a transaction cap is overcome immediately or value leaves elsewhere where it is not constrained.
@_date: 2016-03-06 16:13:02
The decline of nodes year on year is because most users to not need to install or run a bitcoin node to use the bitcoin network - in the past they did.

@_date: 2016-03-05 14:28:27
The focus for months has been on developers and miners. 
But the ultimate arbiters of success or failure for bitcoin are in fact the users and investors. 
The value proposition of bitcoin is tied to existing and future user growth to build transaction volume and buy future coin emission. 
A governance problem which has stalled bitcoin development has effectively frozen the network and thus the market is moving value into other chains which are not restricted by arbitrary transactional limitations.
Be careful what you wish for. Lightning network is of no use if the store of value supporting bitcoin has moved on to other blockchains. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:41:43
Sure you can try and double spend a transaction but you seem to be ignoring reality of 7 years with successful double spend transactions being few and far between. Why?
Because the risk is mitigated to negligible levels by either waiting a few seconds or watching the network for a second fraudulent transaction appearing. 
If 0-conf double spends were remotely an issue they would be raised and we would hear about it. We don't. And removing 0-conf significantly degrades the online usability of bitcoin which don't forget is primarily used for low dollar value transactions. Once again it is adversarial fools like Todd proving that perfect is the enemy of good.
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:40:20
When value leaves bitcoin and the exchange price falls it means that governance at the heart of 'core' is failing. 
And this isn't about changing bitcoin. 
This is about preventing a change in the economics driving bitcoin by failing to raise a temporary transaction cap. 
People are leaving because the cap isn't going to be lifted and the network will be arbitrarily limited.
You know all this so sit back and enjoy the bed you have made for yourself.
EDIT: oh and i have no problem with competition whatsoever. The market will find a way to route around this issue, either by replacing the 'core' flawed suicidal economic model or by moving to alternative blockchains. So far the latter seems to be taking place judging from the bitcoin exchange price.
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:20:49
Or the fact that another blockchain is now approaching a billion dollar market cap..
We are in the the potential early stages of what happens when the first mover blockchain fails to overcome a governance problem - value begins to shift to other chains. Highly predictable.

It isn't rocket science to suggest that for bitcoin to become what you want - a high value settlement network - it has to attain that value by being used by a much larger group of people as a combined payment network and store of value. These two things are inseparable and trying to strangle transaction capacity at this stage is guaranteed to end the bitcoin story prematurely.

What sums up the Classic ('anti-core') position is to continue bitcoin as it has for the last 7 years. On chain transactions with blockspace keeping up with demand for transactions.
If the 'Core' client developers actually listened to the community and built in an upgrade in the blocksize at a specified block height (as suggested by Satoshi in 2010) then Classic would not exist and the price would probably be far higher. 
Instead we have paralysis, a community riven with distrust over motivations and this subreddit functioning as a hollowed out husk where even Theymos has had to tone down his approach for fear of scaring off all remaining users - except socks like you.

Bitcoin development isn't a fan club.
Developers are only useful when the code they produce is aligned with the project they are working on.
Deliberate inaction by 'core' developers over the blocksize issue will change the economics of bitcoin dramatically. Where before the network was open to all, now it will be open only to a few who choose to pay more than the rest. 
Failure to address this economic change will lead to all new capital entering bitcoin drying up and will force a value transfer to other blockchains which are not artificially limited for political reasons as we are now.
Users are not stupid and are the ultimate arbiters of bitcoin value and the direction of the project - not a handful of developers.

Oh and the source for my assertion is that the limit was created years ago to prevent a mining attack on bitcoin - absolutely not what it is being justified to do now which is institute an artificial transaction cap - and Satoshi is on record as saying the limit can be easily raised with a couple of lines of code and increased as required.
You lot can put developers up on a pedestal, try as hard as you like to make bitcoin a complicated black box that should be left to self appointed 'experts', but the reality is that failing to raise the blocksize is simply a political decision taken by a small group of developers who know *exactly* what they are doing.

I am negative with trolls and people who simply trot out the same drivel over and over.
Bitcoin is not experiencing a hockey stick demand curve. Simply staying ahead of demand until additional payment layers can take up the slack is fine. Thus a hard fork to classic and a subsequent flex cap solution would be fine to last the next few years.

@_date: 2016-03-11 20:19:30
No matter how many times you trot this out it simply isn't true.
0-conf is safe for low value dollar transactions if the merchant risk assesses the transaction by watching the network for a double spend attempt. Without RBF after just a few seconds there is a minuscule risk of a successful double spend attack. As time goes on that risk reduces to near nil.
@_date: 2016-03-06 09:33:15
Why the histrionics?
The majority of bitcoin holders like myself have held for years and simply want the project to continue to grow, attract new users and continue in it's original form.
I would not have invested my time programming bitcoin app's or buying btc over the last few years if the project had a transaction cap and developers who did not believe bitcoin could 'scale' whilst simultaneously preventing that from occurring.
EDIT: and segwit is not ready, has forked testnet on at least one occasion in the last few days, requires hundreds of LOC and will only offer minor gains at first. I like the idea but it is highly complex and choosing that non-scaling fix first over a far more simple ecosystem code fix demonstrates that the 'core' developers have lost their way.
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:09:51
No amount of socks like 'BeastmodeBisky' can dispute this.

@_date: 2016-03-05 15:20:56
Incorrect I am afraid.
The names of the camps are irrelevant. One side is proposing freezing the network with an arbitrary transaction cap (which we are abutting). Users unsurprisingly no longer see value in a bitcoin that cannot scale with continuing demand and so will move elsewhere. 
This is happening right now. So far the capital outflows have been a trickle but enough to drive a competing chain up to 1/7th the market cap of bitcoin. If this continues over the coming days then bitcoin will lose it's first mover status.
I consider this a serious threat to bitcoin.

Second RBF is a direct attack on the usefulness of 0-conf which a large number of businesses and users value. That is the reason they choose to remove what is a highly controversial change introduced without discussion in the community whatsoever :)

Are you suggesting Blockstream does not pay it's employees?
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:32:49
Wake up. Users are leaving with their capital to other chains because bitcoin is frozen by a 'core' development team who do not believe in scaling bitcoin. 
The market does believe in scaling and growth and will take it's value elsewhere in a heartbeat if this situation is not resolved.

I do contribute to the bitcoin ecosystem and have coded several projects out in the wild. 
It saddens me that bitcoin is riven like this, but I along with many others will continue to fight for the original principles and economic design of bitcoin as long as bitcoin exists.
Those principles and thoughts were matched by all in the space in the early years, even theymos who featured on that very linked thread. Not all of us have allowed our principles to be besmirched.

I would venture being within weeks of being 10x wealthier has something to do with it :)

There is some truth in what you say. But you only have to look at the unique traffic stats of this subreddit to see that going down the route of 'other clients are alt coins' whilst censoring and banning large numbers of users was a particularly poor move.
We all want bitcoin to succeed.

Why would anyone consider using a forum you moderate after your recent behaviour?
@_date: 2016-03-12 21:37:54
'Nobody cares' that one of the biggest software companies in the world has dropped bitcoin. 
Of course that is probably a good thing in your strange world. We don't want the chain being used too much after all!
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:23:49
This not happening would be a good start..

They are tying themselves in knots trying to keep the discussion 'on message here' lol

Oh look it's the glass empty doomer again. 
Amazing how your online personality has changed since the heady heights of 2013.

2mb nodes are not datacenters.
Meanwhile the as the network becomes overloaded value is moving into alternative blockchains.
Next the price will crash and you'll be scratching your stupid head wondering why.
@_date: 2016-03-07 00:04:57
Why would a fork to 2mb be 'bad for bitcoin'?
And please don't laud some BS argument about 2mb being remotely centralising.
@_date: 2016-03-06 18:31:19
Keep dodging the argument. It looks great to fellow onlookers.
@_date: 2016-03-11 20:46:09
I take your point about RedHat. I just fail to see the same opportunity in bitcoin consulting. 
You are of course correct about on boarding new nodes being irksome. But being frank not everyone needs to run a node, and as bitcoin becomes more popular a smaller and smaller % will do so. Oh and internet connections are getting fast for most of the world, for example netflix use is widespread and the blockchain isn't THAT big :)
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:09:54
The arrogance emanating from you is astounding.

Well if Peter Todd says it I suppose it must be true!
Try thinking for yourself.

Six months late?
Consider hiring a PR person. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 17:14:26
You don't seem to get it. People invested the last 7 years because they foresaw bitcoin scaling as an internet money capable of supporting millions of users globally, a new paradigm of best money ever invented, programmatic inviolable. 
They didn't see 7 years of growth and then an artificial transaction cap with a fee market suddenly introduced.
No one will invest in a system which supports a few thousand users. The ecosystem will die off as the &gt;1bn USD VC funds run out and the price will crater as value shifts into other blockchains not handicapped as bitcoin is currently.
@_date: 2016-03-08 17:03:31
I think it is important to maintain node count to retain decentralisation of bitcoin. But to what degree that is necessary is open to debate.
You are quite right that the vast majority of users should not even have to know what a bitcoin node *is*.
@_date: 2016-02-14 09:14:48
Like it or not bitcoin needs someone to buy newly mined coins and maintain the exchange value of the currency.
Taking steps to ossify the network now with an absurdly low daily transaction ceiling before bitcoin has even approached technical limitations in its pure base layer form is a massive 'political hack' IMO.
Why are new users going to be attracted to bitcoin frozen in its current form? How are transaction fees to make up the shortfall to maintain miner's income as the block reward exponentially drops away?
@_date: 2016-02-13 19:29:07
but but according to that lawyer it's illegal!
@_date: 2016-02-16 00:42:52
Without wanting to get into an argument I think it is a retrograde step. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 08:15:20
great post
@_date: 2016-02-15 13:43:07
I personally don't like the introduction of RBF with 0.12 and therefore I won't be upgrading from 0.11 to 0.12 until a version which neuters the change is released.
@_date: 2016-02-14 09:03:19


Transaction fees should be set by the market based upon a lower bound decided by natural competition between miners.
A maximum_blocksize parameter is actually just another way of saying network 'transaction ceiling'.
If you have any grasp on economics whatsoever then you will understand that imposing a transaction ceiling onto a growing system with a floating transaction fee will not end well.
Unless of course you are proposing limiting bitcoin use to transactions you find acceptable and valid?
Finally, perhaps you could explain how over the coming years with 'mechanism for the fee market to operate efficiently' coupled with a transaction ceiling there is any hope of summed bitcoin transaction fees being enough to keep the mining network alive with an exponentially falling block reward?
@_date: 2016-02-14 09:30:09
Why should developers decide these things at all? Humans are by definition weak and relying upon a consensus of developers is a massive design weakness which goes against the ethos of bitcoin.
Bitcoin should be autonomous, decentralised and guided by the market.
Appeals to authority and design by committee? No thanks.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:36:38
Except that raising the blocksize to 2mb isn't a trivial cost to attack the network as the relationship is not linear.
But details..
@_date: 2016-02-14 12:59:17
Fair enough.
I would love to hear your thoughts on this if you get the chance though:
