The whitepaper introduces the necessity of the hashcash POW, which by definition is inefficient in order to do meaningful work.
As another writer has said (my italics in the relevant part):
Bitcoin is a paradox. Everything is topsy-turvy; a contradiction. Its supply is inelastic, so its users can’t use it as a currency only a commodity, with a volatile price. But the Bitcoin protocol is sound.
It’s billed as a solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem, but it’s fault intolerant from the perspective of its users. Bitcoin has already had one accidental hard fork of the block chain. If you’re part of the minority user group with a different world view, you can’t just snap back to the majority world view and forget everything you saw after the fork. These are supposed to be financial transactions. Increasing the number of independent implementations of the Bitcoin protocol used by miners won’t help. That would make hard forks more likely. But the Bitcoin protocol is sound.
*It goes against all of computer science, which looks for efficiency and flexibility. It is deliberately inefficient and inflexible*. It’s an open source project, but the program’s source code has almost no value. Nearly the entire value resides in the program’s state, which is why the source code can be distributed under one of the most permissive licences. It’s fault intolerance at a practical level, inflexibility and worthlessness of source code have been causing the core developers to complain loudly of late. But the Bitcoin protocol is sound.
It’s built around a trust model that can be summarized simply as “might is right.” And, with irrevocable and difficult to trace movements of a weightless commodity, it’s impractical to keep holdings of bitcoins secure on anything but the smallest of scales. But the Bitcoin protocol is sound.

One of the serious problems with Bitcoin, and any cryptocurrency, that will prevent its widescale adoption is that it is very complex, and it's become more and more complex as time goes by. Now, folks will say "it will be abstracted; TCP was also complicated in the early days".
But complexity is the enemy of security. TCP can get away with it because it's not *money*, its just a protocol. When SSL fails, or hackers plant malware, it's no skin off TCP's back. It's just a protocol.
But BTC *is* money. A problem with the money protocol leads to devaluation and panic. This seems to indicate that a failure of the system is "baked in" as it's only a matter of time before its exploited.
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:48:35
Go for it.
Take the number of transactions that have ever occurred in the world then divide it by the amount of money that it has cost the banks.
It would be nowhere near $40 per transaction.
And keep in mind that the banking infrastructure is mainly comprised of real estate, the best investment you can own. In comparison, the Bitcoin network simply comprises millions of SHA256 chips that will soon be worthless.

What he means is that everyone can see the business's transactions unless the business creates a new address for every transaction, which is confusing, complicated, time consuming and error-prone.  All unnecessary with conventional CC or Square.
And before you start up about how easy it is to steal CC, remember that of all CC or BTC transactions, 99.99999% are using CC. Not a big target for scammers, yet there is already scamming galore.

It was a great article.
However, it makes it abundantly clear to me that not only is Bitcoin not for the uninitiated, it will probably never be for the uninitiated, ie. the adoption curve will be asymptotic.
Compare this technology to that used by the average Joe who swipes his CC and then receives an itemized monthly email statement highlighting his expanding credit limit and rewards balance.
Deterministic Address Pool Wallet? Change Address? -keypool option? Sweeping vs. importing? Huh?
I'm not saying this to be a buzzkiller, just noting that I had difficulty understanding those situations you outlined and I've followed Bitcoin daily *for almost 3 years*. It is what it is: the solutions that are being talked about to overcome these complexities will themselves contain more complexities.
Call me Bill Gates but I see *no mainstream adoption* of this currency barring a collapse of the US dollar, at which point BTC would probably be worthless anyway.

This paper was *published* in 1996. That doesn't mean it's methods were not being derived before then, just that NSA decided to talk about the technology at that point.
Similarly, you would have to be naive to think that, in the thirteen intervening years since the paper was written and the advent of the blockchain, that no one at these agencies was not deriving Bitcoin.  
Otherwise you have to believe they just stopped looking at the technology and said "Nope, we're not interested".

That would require that everybody download a patched miner. What if the source changes its addresses?


Or to steal certain high BTC transactions, which admittedly would require a high degree of coordinated timing, but is well within the capability of skilled cyberthiefs and state actors.


IMO the "love of Bitcoin" is on an asymptotic rise.  Long before it is "game over for the state" Bitcoin will be a discredited, illegal black market in this country.
I think the best case for Bitcoin is that it will operate in parallel as it does now. 
Worst case for Bitcoin, it's subsumed by a centralized crypto-currency a la JPMorganCoin.

From the FAQ:
- Once you've sent the Bitcoins, the till should say that they have been received. If there's a problem (users of the blockchain.info wallet often find that there's a 20 or 30 minute delay at this point) we can set the transaction aside and check for payment later.
- If you overpay, we don't give change
- How many people are paying with Bitcoin? Not many.

2. New adopters are expected to pay 1% more instead of 5% less.
3. There is an incredible potential (via blockchain analysis) for the government to go after users that are spending Bitcoin (via merchants) and not reporting profits they have realized on their Bitcoin.
4. The fact that businesses must pay their tax in USD.  A light bulb just went off in my head as to what this really means for the future of "native" bitcoin adoption.

The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company. However, with Bitcoin/crypto just recently gaining acceptance in the public eye, the likely damage in public perception to this class of technology could put it back 5~10 years, and cause governments to react swiftly and harshly. At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of Bitcoin, at least for most of the public.

They are front running.  Front running is a form of insider trading, which is illegal. Because of the technology being used, this type of front running is in a legal gray area.
Since the Lewis book was released, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney General, New York state prosecutors and the SEC have all confirmed they are investigating the practices of high-speed front running. SEC is leaning toward legal, FBI and Justice toward illegal. We'll see.

And if your answer is "Because I don't have $1000 to my name", then your problem is more serious than fees at a cash machine. Try living within your means and saving a small nest egg.
And you should be using CC for almost everything anyway so that you can get 1-5% back on your purchases.

Gandhi told everyone to sit back and let the Germans kill who they wanted. Oh, and he later took three bullets to the chest and died.  Are you sure you want him as your Bitcoin mascot?
From wikipedia:
Gandhi's views came under heavy criticism in Britain when it was under attack from Nazi Germany, and later when the Holocaust was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, "I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."[162] George Orwell remarked that Gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian Power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.' [163]
In a post-war interview in 1946, he said, "Hitler killed five million Jews. It is the greatest crime of our time. But the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife. They should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs... It would have aroused the world and the people of Germany... As it is they succumbed anyway in their millions."[164] Gandhi believed this act of "collective suicide", in response to the Holocaust, "would have been heroism".[165]

The 1 paragraph was in Levitin's blog:
The IRS ruled that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are property, not currency.  This means that they are subject to capital gains taxation.  And that means that Bitcoins are not fungible.  The price at which a particular Bitcoin was acquired (and this is traceable) determines the capital gains on that particular Bitcoin when spent.  If I spend Bitcoin A, which I bought at $10, but is now worth $400, I’ve got a very different tax treatment than if I spend Bitcoin B, which I bought at $390. (Poor Satoshi--he's got a lot more capital gains than most...)  This means Bitcoins are not fungible, and that makes it unworkable as a currency.  If I have to figure out which particular Bitcoin in my wallet I want to spend and what the tax treatment will be, Bitcoin just doesn't work as a commercial medium of exchange.  Bitcoin still works as a speculative medium, but Bitcoin's claim has always been to being more than the latest iteration of the trading sardines--it aspired to be a commercial medium.  I don't see that happening now.

But Buffet is not buying pizza and computers with his stock certificates. 
Imagine if gold had somehow become deflationary, say a new property was discovered whereby global warming has triggered a chemical change in all gold and it now increases in weight, and hence value, by 20% a year. And now image if people are using gold coins as a currency.
You would have the same problem: tax must be computed on each purchase at the value of the gold at the time.  That makes it non-fungible. Sure, an app could be developed that keeps track of how much you owe on your purchases based on what price your BTC was acquired at, but now you are basically using stock certificates as a currency.
That's why Levitin says this scenario is unlikely.

Coinbase I believe is in a gray area of untested regulations whereby they serve as the middleman between your bank and a source of BTC. They do not appear to have a "bank"... but I'm sure their private investors do.
From stackexchange:
Coinbase unlike Mt.Gox is not a bitcoin exchange, it is a bitcoin wallet with the option of buying or selling bitcoins using a US bank account. You can store bitcoins on the site but not USD.
This is primarily done for legal reasons. When you allow people to trade currency with each other instead of just being a currency dealer you open yourself up to a whole world of regulatory problems. Namely people would have to be extensively verified and new anti money laundering systems would have to be put in place to comply with FinCEN.

Do we use TCP/IP as a basis for money supply? Transistors? CD-ROM drives? All these facilitate modern money supply but are not BASIS for money.






You cannot simulate the "genuine article" that is gold bullion.  You can easily simulate a cryptocurrency, that is the difference.






It may work "as" money but will not be the BASIS for money any more than a gift card or airline miles are the BASIS of money.






And there are plenty of virtual coins that can out do Bitcoin. And there will be many, many more. OTOH, nothing *outdoes* gold.  Gold is the Big Bang of money.




If Bitcoin survives, it will provide useful ways to manipulate financial transactions.  That's ***IF*** it is not outlawed, fails to gain acceptance, is hacked, has 50% takeover, gets replaced, encounters a fatal bug, or otherwise loses it's "luster", pardon the pun.

But I think that's the point, it ***did*** have to be a wasteful power sucking mess.  The "work" that  is being done in POW is to secure the transaction history in the blockchain.  Work done solving a folding problem is just that: work solving a folding problem.
Now, different types of proof of stake exist, that might be used in conjunction with folding problems. But that wouldn't be Bitcoin.
What's yet to be determined with the existing POW in Bitcoin is how the network evolves (or devolves) in the computational race to the bottom.

Did I say forcibly searched or seized?  No, I said if you went to retrieve your gold you were screwed. The *MYTH* is that the government went to each bank and drilled all the safe deposit boxes.
If you left the gold in the box you were fine. But there are no instances of folks being allowed to keep or remove their gold "just because it was in a safe deposit box". It would be confiscated before you could remove it from the vault.

“Bitcoin is a technological tour de force. **640K should be enough for anybody**. Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be. Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don’t have to be physically in the same place and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient. The customers we’re talking about aren’t trying to be anonymous. You know they’re willing to be known so the Bitcoin technology is key and you could add to it or you could build a similar technology where there’s enough attribution that people feel comfortable this is nothing to do with terrorism or any type of money laundering.“

A compromise may be needed to have successful transition to crypto.

2. Absolute identification of each person. This is even more futuristic as it will need to blend biometrics with as-yet-to-be invented technology that cannot be compromised though conventional means. It would be similar to the revolution that DH public key encryption and the blockchain brought about.  Think Shamir's Secret Sharing on steroids.

Competition from altcoins is the price Bitcoin will pay for being a currency that's unregulated, decentralized and peer-to-peer. I see that as one of its major problems, since it will take years for the experiment to run its course and see if dilution and technical improvements by the altcoins will be part of Bitcoin's demise.

Just as the 40-hour work week replaced the 60-hour work week in the 1940's, moving towards a 20- or 30-hour work week would seem to make sense at first glance. But the problem is that labor today is very specialized so that would be impractical to implement and of course very unpopular in a capitalist society. Upheavals of deeply entrenched ideologies may be required.
And even then, with a 20-hour work week, eventually automation subsumes practically everything.  The idea of employment becomes a psychological necessity. The question becomes not "how can we establish a universal basic income" but "how can we restore the sense of worth that is satisfied by meaningful employment?"

The first problem is the predatory nature.
The second problem is that most of these people  cannot manage their own money or are drug addicts, thus the interest rate is high.
Sorry, but Bitcoin does not solve either of these societal problems.

Say you made $1000 profit on one BTC (bought at 100, **cashed out** at 1100).  Then that **same year**, you were goxxed $1000.
You could use the loss to the offset the profit.  But ONLY if you report the profit.
That is how I understand gambling loss, I could be wrong (I don't gamble or own BTC).
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:21:26
I think it's more serious than you suggest.  If Bitcoin price levels fluctuate or even simply rise as some suggest, the mistake of selecting BTC/mBTC/uBTC in a transaction will be *irreversible*.

That might work in some second world financial backwoods like Cyprus but as long as it's going to compete with the CC companies and US dollar it's not going to cut it. The regulations will be getting stricter not more lenient.
Why on earth (other than sending $ to someone overseas) would I want to put hard earned cash in a Bitcoin ATM?
Is there someplace besides Silk Road that requires bitcoin and does not accept dollars?
Help me out here, I'm trying to understand why the general populace would every want to use these things outside of novelty and speculating that the currency "will go to the moon".

What good is that petaHz of mining doing anyone at this point? It's a race to the bottom of the resources/security curve at a time when there is not much at all to secure. That's more like a Pyramid Scheme and not a history of POTS/PSN/ISDN.

What is the typical Bitcoin user gaining from the skyrocketing costs of running the Bitcoin network?  
This is a serious question. Are transactions cheaper now? Easier? Faster? More popular?  No. And since only the huge farms are left running the show, one can argue that they are not even more secure. In fact they are probably **less** secure.

I did not say the rate was variable I said the fees are negotiated and will depend on whether you are talking about a vendor that sells hot dogs versus one that sells high-end jewelry. A Rolex dealer does not pay the same fee as a pedicab driver. 
Furthermore 3% of a hotdog sale and 1.5% of a $10,000 watch sale sounds reasonable. 
- In the first case Visa does not make jack shit off  of the hotdog sale.
- In the second case they are providing buyer protection so that your 10 grand does not disappear into a one-way blockchain.

Yes. Self-driving teledildonic DACs will be the rule in our future.

That's pretty cool. Did not know you could do that with Google Docs.

It depends on the transaction and what rates the merchant has negotiated with Visa.
If a merchant sells items that cost $1000 he will pay a much lower rate than a pedicab driver would.

More fine print than a $100 bill.

The guy sounds like a well-rounded idiot and the video seems like an cheap infomercial.

No, the moral to the story is that hackers will target Bitcoin and there is no recourse for the owner when not if it gets stolen.
Such is life for the computer user who thinks he can compete with the security, backup, investigative and insurance mechanisms used by real banks.

Just because it worked for Helicopter Ben doesn't mean it's a trend.

Yet research shows that 33% of all bitcoins have been lost or stolen.

Study was concerned with why *science* articles get negative comments.  Bitcoin may involve computer programming but its more of an experimental religion at this point, not an experimental science. Likewise, economics is more emotional and social than scientific.
And we feel the need to come here because we see the Bitcoin experiment failing, not because we want to harass your cult members. Well, most of the time anyway.

That's hilarious. I thought you were kidding!

The number of bank failures has gone down every year since 2010. How does this make your point?

Bitcoin is *one gaping* security problem.  Even the core developers say it must be run on SE Linux. 
Unless you're talking about just playing with a few dollars.

Wait a minute. First you say its just like the Internet. Now you claim it's only *one-ninth* of the Internet?

Another reason is that pot sales are all done in person, so the magic of paying electronically across vast distances falls short.
Cash is still king.

To reduce the hot swap time window by 66% always insist on 3-phase power when visiting public libraries.  Or better yet [12-phase](

No. Maybe if the only Bitcoin users were still Satoshi and Finney and they were just buying the occasional pizza.
I think the reason it has not been changed is that Bitcoin users are in denial.

Nice work. You should look into selling that to the hip hop artists.
