So by that logic anyone asking for a raise at their job is greedy? 
To educate you, "payed" is spelt "paid".

You *realise* that realise is the English way of spelling the word?
Doesn't mean it's not a mockery. You're addressing a point that I didn't make with a point which I agree with.

Why did you link to your own twitter rather than the actual article?

To what extent are you transferring your bitcoins to fiat, in the case that bitcoin fails in the future? Let's be honest, you're not going to keep all of tens of millions of US dollars in bitcoin just because you believe in it. That would be so incredibly naive, given bitcoin's changeability.

...And at the moment, has not got widespread adoption. It will by no means be a quick process, and this event will not help the cause. I do hope it succeeds, but at the moment you can not be certain of anything. Plus, if it does get big, governments will likely want to get their paws on legislating it.

You need to seriously consider the risks. Bitcoin is still young and is definitely not established as a currency. That is not to say that it will not be in the future, that is yet to be seen. However as such, you should be wary of investing money that you cannot afford to lose in to it. Like it or not, the US dollar is too big to effectively lose the majority of its value overnight. Bitcoin is definitely the more volatile of the two.

What's the difference between a gamble and a risky investment? It's 20% of portfolio, there's no two ways about it.

If it's worth 100k, then it will be practically useless. 1 satoshi will buy you loads.

That's a security risk - if those supernodes are held by malicious users then they could give themselves BTC.
