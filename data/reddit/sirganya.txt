Was that tip for real?

Looks like it'll be a double album ;)

The only thing I'd wonder is how much the government might regulate bricks and mortar stores from accepting BTC, it'd be easy to send in an agent and shut a place down, much like licensing laws for pubs and bars. That might prevent the uptake.

Because there's only a certain amount of them and he'd want to own them all.

Use of the word them is a count-to-mass transformation. Last time I crack a joke around here...

Watch The Trap and Pandora's box by British film maker Adam Curtis for an excellent view of these theories in context in the real world.

Agreed, Paypal still feels un-internet like. The smoothness and ease you'd expect seems to be hindered by its justified paranoia. While it was fairly revolutionary it's always felt clunky. Money wants to be free to move, which is  going to add a new dimension to Keynesian monetary theory considering the effect of such a mobile medium of exchange with a limited pool of value. Exciting times ahead.

the album was made by passing a sine wave through a quantum oscillator  attached to the left ventricle of the heart of a living chimera inhabiting  the north face of K2. Just lugging the batteries up that f'n hill cost me a slice of the mythical pizza.

aww, I'm poor too,  but you can listen to it on the site and if you know what your doing I'm sure you can nab it and etch it to your wax cylinder player ;) Enjoy!

Ask  one question of two economists, get three answers.
Have a look at the relationship between the Nobel foundation and the Nobel prize for economics. There is none.  It's not considered a science. When I studied it I was in the Arts department, alongside English and Philosophy. 
Watch some Adam Curtis documentaries. 
Bitcoins are digital travelers cheques.

Well said. It's like a game show at the moment. Timely reminder of what's what.

I have faith in the open source community, looking at the way open source developers work compared to those who work under pressure for companies (what sort of pressure caused some poor developer to leave the email addresses for sony's PS network  unencrypted) and the various breaches of MS security over the years always led me to believe that leaving  code open allows it to be shored up by interested and capable engineers. But that is a definite possibility.
Bandwidth is always increasing and more raw power is available, an infrastructure of dedicated GPUs will definitely come on stream in an organic way.
Entities like coinbase, teething problems admittedly, will become more popular.. and there's some serious interest in thing like BTC ATMs being developed. I think we'll see some innovative ideas, but they are definitely issues that have to be dealt with for sure.
