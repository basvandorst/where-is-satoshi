Didn't you sign a contract with him for the collateral (mining equipment)?

How are you able to offer a discount for payments made in BTC?

One option is to create a digital menu (maybe on a website or on a tablet) that self updates QR codes based on the current exchange rate.

Of course. The audience doesn't really know any different and will lump all coins together. They will only remember the word "scam".

Unrelated question, but why don't cryptocurrencies check to see if an address actually works (belongs to the proper network) when someone sends a payment? This would prevent mistaken sends.

The one person who knows what he's talking about. 10-K reports list a bunch of risks, however remote, just to avoid shareholder lawsuits.

Databases, by nature, are mutable. Blockchains aren't.

IOTA and Nano are other examples not mentioned on that page.
There are legitimate concerns about any of these coins, but the point is that there's no mining.

Can you please go into more detail? I hold IOTA but I can't find any meaningful criticism of it in the IOTA subreddit so I need to go elsewhere to find it.

But exchange transactions will show how much you may have transferred to your Ledger. I suppose you could argue that not all of the exchange withdrawals were to yourself/your Ledger.

This is the fundamental problem with all unstable cryptocurrencies.

If you say that, you may have to give up those addresses, too.

In the UK, you're forced to remember everything?

I really appreciate this analysis. It's hard to come by substantive analysis of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:48:55
I think you're confusing mining and validation. There are cryptocurrencies with no mining, but they have validation mechanisms. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:04:34
But why do you have to use the term bcash when you know it's offensive to members of that community? This shows there is a sports team mentality, but for us geeks, we insult each other's coins instead of teams.

That's not necessarily a problem. There are cryptocurrencies with no mining. 
To validate transactions, you need nodes (network participants). With Bitcoin, mining incentivizes additional nodes, but there are ways to encourage more nodes without a profit motive.
