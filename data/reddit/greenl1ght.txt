1. Seems pretty easily solveable initially through monitoring the P2P network for a few seconds and accepting 0-confirm transactions when you don't see an instant double-spend, and eventually through third-party paypal/creditcard type systems. I'm not too worried about this.
2. Is my BIGGEST worry. Governments and huge corporations like Adobe can't protect their shit. There was just a **major 10-year-old security flaw** found in a popular open source TLS library. I'm willing to bet a majority of the world's PCs are already owned by botnets or malware. The state of the art of computer security is *SHIT* and there's no light at the end of the tunnel.
3. This is just indicative of the kind of early adopters Bitcoin has. It worries me, but it's something that could pass.
4. This is also solveable via insurance/paypal type system, but waaay futher down the line when there's a big enough market for it. It's real chicken/egg problem, and will only be solved if enough people falsely trust the system before these systems are in place. A large implosion could take place before this, simply due to it not existing.

Which is quickly easily dwarfed by credit card charge reversal fees and the risk of them reaching a too high % chargeback rate with Visa/MC and getting hit by more fees and holds on that end of things.
PayPal is way way way more beholden to the credit card companies than most haters realize. PayPal's real business is being a buffer between the CC companies and small businesses, letting people who would otherwise accept credit cards, and being better at fraud detection than the CC companies, skimming a couple % in between.
The small business I work for switched to a traditional card merchant account, and the experience was so bad that we switched back to paypal after a couple months. And this is *despite* at one point being fucked over by PayPal with a 180 day 30% rolling hold. A "real" merchant account was THAT bad. And before you mention Stripe, our fees are lower with PayPal.

American banks are even worse. I have a friend who works at a company that does iOS development. They buy new gear from the Apple Store online on at least a monthly basis (testing devices, upgrades, etc). Each fucking time, Bank of America flagged their card for suspicious activity. After a year of putting up with that shit he finally changed banks. It was ridiculous. And then you see when card details *actually* get stolen like in the Target hack, and they don't even go and replace people's cards until they ask...
Meanwhile my Swedish bank doesn't go apeshit over every single transaction, but will quickly send me a new card in the mail if they detect I've used my card at an ATM/retailer that's suspected to have been involved in skimming.

The EMV liability shift documentation says that *before* EMV, the card issuer was liable for fraud, and after EMV, the merchant is liable for fraud. So since the EMV shift hasn't happened in the US, "the majority of US cards and majority of US merchants" should have the liability on the card issuer (banks).

What worries me about this is how the the reference implementation is the definition of the bitcoin protocol. You have to interpret each checkin to the reference implementation to know how to keep your own implementation up-to-date, and be sure to not misinterpret the impact of a specific if-statement or whatever. In a more formal protocol, there's a plaintext spec that's updated first, and then the implementations are updated to conform to the spec.
Or am I missing a spec somewhere?

Depends on how early they lost them. If they lost them when a BTC was worth $10, it's easy to see them thinking they can make it up.

If they held over 50% of the exchange volume, and skimmed 2% or whatever in fees off of every transaction (I have no idea what their fees actually were), they could probably have tried to make a case for it. Just look at their fantasy profitability projections in the leaked recovery documents. Delusional, but they probably convinced themselves... I'm not saying they had a chance, just that they *thought* they did.
But I honestly have a hard enough time wrapping my head around them holding 750K BTC, whatever actually happened to them must have been something absolutely ridiculous. Which it's why it's so easy to believe half of these crazy theories.

I'm not really going to attempt to defend the Yahoo analogy as it is in the OP, since it's not really great. But what layman analogy is?


The analogy puts bitcoin against email. So the Yahoo equivalent to MtGox losing everyone's coins through a hack or bug is someone hacking into Yahoo and wiping their servers, not Yahoo going bankrupt. MtGox lost bitcoin. So in the analogy, Yahoo should lose email. In that case, they WOULD suddenly go offline. The OP says "yahoo went bankrupt" which doesn't work.


It's fully possible to have an exchange where you still hold the private key(s) to your own bitcoins. Mt Gox didn't implement that though. Just another reason we need better exchanges.

You have no fucking idea what an analogy is do you? 
We're not talking about Yahoo's security measures vs Mt Gox's security measures. That was never the topic! The point of the analogy the whole time was "what impact does the implosion of Mt Gox have on bitcoin", with the explanation being "the same impact Yahoo imploding would have on email". Saying "but Yahoo has better security practices, that would never happen!" is completely beside the point and doesn't change the analogy at all.


So email isn't digital codes? Email is physical?


Email can have value as well. Trade secrets. If those are stolen and spread, you can lose immense value that can't be undone.

@_date: 2014-03-04 13:45:01
$1.50 is still stupid expensive.

Most countries have something like this. Heck, *PayPal* is a bigger competitor to bitcoin than traditional banking transfers.
Bitcoin is still important, because as soon as you go outside a countries borders, it all breaks down. Regulations start going crazy with anti-money laundering rules, banks start charging massive fees, delays creep in, and payment start being blocked due to anti-terrorism legislation (try writing certain keywords in the "message" field of an international transfer)

@_date: 2015-03-21 07:39:09
There is no central authority though. The exchanges are free to reject coins, and you're free to ignore them. The authorities have always been able to legislate the exchanges to reject certain coins, this doesn't change anything.
Bitcoin has always been consensus-based. If enough people came to a consensus, they could fork the blockchain tomorrow with a client that introduces inflation. This completely free market is the whole basis for Bitcoin. If the consensus among bitcoin users is that we don't want to deal with tainted coins, then they'll lose their value.

PayPal are already doing fraud management on a massive scale. They already have to deal with scammy dealers soliciting payments, cashing them out, and then the customers doing chargebacks on their credit cards, leaving PayPal on the hook. That is what they DO. That's what all their competitors failed at. 
Just like how they do it now, they can fund the chargebacks with their transaction fees (edit: and rolling holds). Tracing coins through the blockchain may even give them better data for detecting fraud (stolen coins etc).
If you had protection/insurance on all bitcoin purchases/sales you made through PayPal, for a 1-2% fee, they could capture a huge portion of the market. This is exactly what bitcoin proponents want - layers ontop of the bitcoin protocol to provide for chargebacks and other features.

The Japanese banks I've looked into all require SWIFT transactions to be filled out on paper forms and turned into their offices, or called in via phone manually. The only one I could find with online banking for SWIFT was the one MtGox are(were?) with (Mizuho)

Money Laundering/Know Your Customer laws. This is why when the banks turned a blind eye to mexican cartels moving tons of drug money through them it was illegal - they have to keep tabs on what their customers are doing by law.

If Bitcoin succeeds, PayPal has the brand power and customer base to be a huge player. Right now most of PayPals fees go to VISA/MasterCard. You don't think they'd love to grab those themselves?

Depends on what currency the deal was made in. You can already pay for purchases in EUR or Yen with a USD PayPal balance, why would it work any different with BTC?

Picked up 3 BTC when they were around $40. Spent 1 BTC on places like namecheap. I'd get more, but now all the exchanges require ID validation, and I refuse to scan and upload my passport to some exchange that might get hacked tomorrow.

Just because the bank was struggling for the past 2 months doesn't mean they told Mt. Gox about it until it was too late or warned that there may be a breaking point.

They're not sitting there with Bitcoin-Qt doing this manually. They're not checking them once and then going "oh well, no money here, I'll just forget about this one then".  They shove them in a pile somewhere, and have a script that monitors the blockchain and notifies them when coins have arrived into any of the addresses. They could easily do this for thousands and thousands of addresses in perpetuity (see: blockchain.info monitors every transaction and address ever, no reason any hacker couldn't do the same easily).
tl;dr: You're wrong. The only way to be safe with paper wallets is to generate them offline booted from a trusted LiveCD, and not keeping any of the data around.

Yeah they're regular ATMs, but only one ones at bank branches, not the ones at convenience stores or shopping malls. Find one with a button marked お振込 and next step 現金 or その他. Non-branch ones will ask for a カッシユカード instead

When we used BitPay to sell a software bundle (which is also easy to revoke), we set it to 0 confirmations in order to get instant payments. Worked well, we had nobody try to scam us.
Does anyone know what the actual risk is for double spends? And how it compares to credit card fraud risk? Have there been any double-spends in the wild aside from during that version-bug fork we had a few mo ago? 
It might make sense for BitPay to have the option for a variable confirmation depending on amount. Accept 0 confirmations for &lt;$10, 1 confirm for &lt;$100, then after that 6 confirms.

Not really an edge case. Anyone who's written code that deals with money has had to deal with the "user mashes the submit button 10 times in a row" problem.

I've run PCs 24/7 for years without issues. It's actually better for components to be running continually than to be powered on and off all the time. The only parts I've ever had crap out are harddisks, fans (caked with dust), and really cheap shitty power supplies.

Even when accepting physical cards you're exposing yourself to chargeback, stolen and skimmed card risks. Wouldn't surprise me if zero confirmations is at a similar risk level
@_date: 2013-12-13 10:32:28
And dogecoin has 60 seconds per confirmation, so it's clearly more than twice as good as litecoin.
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:21:59
The connection "start"→"enter" didn't really work out logically I guess so I just removed that part.
We're just using BitPay for processing, so you don't all have to hammer the "Buy now" button just to see what we've done :) [they have a 100 invoices/hr limit, hopefully we don't hit that too soon from all the tire-kickers!]

They reason they have the "suspicious activity" lockdowns is to avoid getting screwed on chargebacks. Since Bitcoins can't do chargebacks, wouldn't this actually alleviate that?

They won't generate any more coins when the difficulty is adjusted upwards.

Oddly enough, in my experience, international wire transfers are fine, at least as long as you have SWIFT and an exact IBAN (all bets are off if they need to start matching custom account+branch number formats and names and addresses).
I used to get paid to a US bank account. Both my employer and I had Bank of America. It took 4 DAYS for the transfer. Within the same bank!! Now that I get paid to an international SWIFT account, it completes within one business day, which is perfectly reasonable.
@_date: 2013-09-06 10:00:31
Chargebacks would be filed on the credit card or bank end, which paypal and ebay can't do anything about.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:08:06


Bullshit. Every credit card processor keeps a rolling hold until you've proven your fraud level. PayPal is no different. My company actually switched back from using a bank+CC merchant account to using PayPal since they were less of a pain in the ass in that regard (we have a large % of international sales, merchant accounts hate that).
@_date: 2013-06-22 04:34:55


Have you been paying any attention whatsoever? Banks aren't exactly welcoming Bitcoiners as new customers. 
This is also why Mt Gox is one of the few exchanges out there - it's increasingly hard for a Bitcoin exchange to take fiat funds in since banks all shun Bitcoin customers.
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:25:26
People are bitching about them saving the bank now?
I thought back in 2008 every *wanted* the banks to be allowed to fail. And yes, that means losing all your deposits up to the insured amount.
It's the free market. You should have been smarter than to put your money in a bank that made reckless loans.
If we get a free bitcoin market with banks that do investment for an interest return, the same thing could happen there, and we won't have any government bailouts there for sure.

MtGox can't even keep their site up, it seems far more likely that MtGox is *being manipulated* than that they *are manipulating*.

Couldn't they? The blockchain is an open public ledger. They could trace all the bitcoins from start to finish.
