I would keep using coinbase for instant buys. Personally I'm willing to accept that as the buyer they are passing on the credit card processing fees to us. Other fees they tack on are outrageous. Even using the USD wallet with money you already have on coinbase has fees!
That said, it's difficult for me to find exchanges that will work for me at all, due to the laws around it where I live. Slim pickin's.

This is a really good article. Thanks for sharing!

Why/how did that flash crash happen?

I was told you have to pay taxes on all gains, even if it's selling one cryptocurrency for another. 
If you've been doing this, it might be worth consulting with an accountant who knows this stuff.

Which fork is coming and when?

That would be a disaster if it didn't immediately bounce back up, but I'm sure there's enough fill orders set up for every price drop imaginable that it would go right past it anyway.

From $19k+ to $16k in the last few minutes. Maybe it's correcting now.

If you feel uncomfortable with the current state if he market and are too worried about a potential crash of some sort, I would suggest selling some, but not all, of your currency. That way, the gains you have made now are safe in your hands, but if things continue to grow then you won't entirely miss out. How much you want to keep and sell would be up to your own judgement.

Switch from coinbase to GDAX. Same company so transferring is easy and your GDAX account should clear quickly, but the interface is more advanced and with way less fees. However, you cannot buy with a credit card, only bank transfers, wires, or by day trading with the coins you currently have. Bank transfers take time to clear and prices can be wildly different by the time money shows up in your account.

I'm a female with Bitcoin and some alts but if the comments here are any indication it's no wonder why more women aren't drawn in. I don't appreciate the original joke, either. This is not what I'd call welcoming and inclusive. 
Edit: see all the comments bitching at me in response? If you actually *want* women to be part of this community, this will not help. If you enjoy crypto/this sub as a boys' club, then by all means, continue because it works. 
I actually posted this comment knowing full well it would receive vitriol. Not because I said anything really offensive or blatantly wrong, but because there's a ton of misogyny in the cryptocurrency community and calling it out always brings out the vipers.

In the reverse situation, "taco stand" complements it quite nicely.

I'm a woman and I hope this is just a bad community and not representative of crypto attitudes as a whole.

Because OP started a conversation on why women aren't around or as interested. I provided an answer. [The same answer applies to why women leave STEM]( Given how cryptocurrency started off with computer nerds, they're pretty tied together.

Sure am, but I know how to avoid the pits. For an allegedly "warm and fuzzy" sub, I'm not impressed. Most of what I see in crypto subs is kinda shitpost-y anyway.
However, if someone complains about how much their favorite community is a total hot dog stand and then the responses involve a bunch of sexist comments, that's a shameless hypocrisy. Women don't go where they can see they're not welcome, and this isn't welcoming behavior.  Anyone who takes issue with this has to work on making it better.
