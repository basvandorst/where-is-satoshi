I didn’t find it either sarcastic or funny, I honestly thought it was genuine, and I wasn’t the only one it seems. 
I do agree with your sentiments here, I hold bitcoin for the same reasons as you, I hope to spend it, not sell for fiat. 
You have echoed my point that age, along with gender, race, social status etc. should not be a discriminatory factor in crypto ownership. 
Again, I’m sorry for the personal dig at you, it was uncalled for. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:18:54
It would  easier to read if you used normal currency notation, i.e. the dollar sign before the value.

As a bloke in his fifties who’s been buying bitcoin for three years, I was amused and a bit concerned at your post. 
But after reading your post history you hate the older generation and women.

I would say that it is still decentralised, that hasn’t changed. 
If you are right and I do agree, up to a point then all it means is that the financial establishment has found an effective way to manipulate the market. 
This is not decentralisation. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:17:35
You may be right about the first part, but to be honest,  from experience in my social circle, my age related peers are as positive and curious about crypto as I am. 
However, I have several nieces and nephews (18 - 25 yrs old)  who either know nothing about crypto or disregard it as “stupid nerd money”.
There are doubters and ignorami in all age brackets, of that there is no doubt. 
Anybody that describes Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme is simply ignorant, regardless of age. 
Age should not have been a factor in the original post.

I can’t see why they would do these ratings if there’s not a plan in place for filling their own pockets.

I remember a European company a few years back that would buy physical PMs with bitcoin, but I can’t find a similar service anywhere now. 
I don’t imagine there’s a lot of people willing to buy metals with bitcoin unless it’s to get out of a falling bitcoin market waiting for a recovery.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:29:57
Correct me if I’m wrong, but it looks like it only refers to digital gold and silver purchased from bitpanda that can be used to buy bitcoin within their platform. 
I’d be a lot more interested if I could exchange my precious metals (that I physically hold) for bitcoin, skipping the fiat bridge I’d have to use now. 
If anybody knows of a company in the UK that will buy my metals with bitcoin I’d like to hear about it.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:13:44
It was in mainland Europe if I recall, but not too sure, I haven’t found anything in the UK. Roll on the days when the local Cash Converters or pawnshop will offer bitcoin, but I think we’ll have to wait a while for that.
Edit: I just found a London Company, Sharps Pixley that will do what I’m looking for, but they pay out using Bitpay, I’d rather drop the middleman and get BTC direct.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:32:44
This is so bad, I have no investing experience either, I’d better just sell all my bitcoin now, 
If I’d known it was a prerequisite then I would have left bitcoin for all these nice Wall Street chaps to buy it instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:50:54
It could be that the recent surge left them a bit short of bitcoin and had to buy from other exchanges. This would result in higher prices for Coinbase customers. 
I’m not saying this is the case btw, just a theory. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:03:03
I’ve noticed this more on Gdax than Bitstamp.  Their trading algorithms may be slightly different. 
From what I can see the period of price stability comes from the meeting of a buy wall and a sell wall. 
This takes some time to determine who wins this battle, sometimes minor, sometimes not. The market price will then take the momentum from the battle until it runs out of steam or another two walls collide. 
To see this in action I suggest you watch the real time market depth chart on Gdax, my description will make a lot more sense (I hope). 
Zoom right in on the charts to see the walls.

Too many posts like this right now. 
If you bought for the long term and believe bitcoin has a future then you wouldn’t be asking. 
If you bought for short term profits you didn’t do your research and shouldn’t have bothered buying. 
Sorry if this sounds harsh but this isn’t what bitcoin is about. 
It’s more than likely that if you do sell you will have huge regret sooner than you think.

If you give them the log in details to a blockchain wallet they are able to access the 12 word backup seed used to recover your wallet. 
If, for example, a normal user forgot their password the seed will gain access to their bitcoin without the password. 
This happened to me a few years ago. 
Changing your password doesn’t stop them gaining access unfortunately, the seed is still valid for that wallet. 
This scam is aimed at newcomers to bitcoin who don’t yet understand wallet security. 
I’m sorry for your loss.

If the coins are from the Royal Mint they have a denomination in Sterling, therefore no tax is due. If the coins are not denominated in Sterling, e.g. foreign coins, they are treated as bullion and CGT will be applied.

Annom is right, my bank the TSB told me a deposit from a foreign bitcoin exchange would raise a flag and cause the payment to be blocked possibly leading to my account being terminated. They have even blocked international payments to bitcoin exchanges.

Is it possible that the Bitcoin project was instigated by the governments and banks and it is they that hold Satoshi's million coins along with any more acquired since inception?
They could quite easily be sitting on a stash of several million bitcoin that would wield considerable power, both politically and economically when the price reaches the levels we all hope for.

I’m no expert on TA, but always assumed it had a lot to do with our psychology and it’s interaction with a free trading market.

If he does sell a large portion of his stash then as long as they’re being bought up by the average Joe who only aspires to hold one or two then I see that as a good move, although it will hurt the market in the short term.

My initial comment was not entirely clear but was referring to a bitcoin transaction. 
Displaying the same price for goods does not bind you to the price however. It’s often possible for a customer to haggle a bit, that’s where a small discount for cash payment can be given, although cash deposit charges at banks are making this less attractive to retailers.

Are you just looking for a wallet as per the title or are you looking for an online wallet with buying capabilities?

I’d like to give you a little bit of friendly advice. 
Your posts this morning are numerous and not very high quality. 
You may risk a ban by the moderators for spamming the sub. 
The majority of your questions can be answered easily, Google is your friend.
 
It is good that you have a newfound interest in bitcoin, please don’t be discouraged by my comment, but over 20 posts in a short time will not bring you the answers you seek. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:51:06
 Wow, didn’t expect my opinions to trigger hatred. 
Chill, have a beer, put your feet up. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:46:21
If you’re using bitcoindotcon and Roger Ver as sources you should be aware that it’s mostly anti-bitcoin propaganda. 
I can’t comment on your other sources, but I have seen censorship on both bitcoin and btc subreddits. 
@_date: 2019-09-05 16:16:51
This may true in the US, but it won’t have much value in countries with low gun ownership.

Burns night, summer equinox to name a couple. 
If you visit I’ll buy you a pint and show you my favourite haggis hunting spot, it’s an old volcano two miles from my house!

Please don’t be discouraged. There is a lot to learn, I first bought bitcoin in 2015, I still feel like a novice at times 
I was not being argumentative with you, just frustrated that your concept of what bitcoin is is not what is considered to be true, especially in this sub. 
There are other subs where your post would garner more positivity, help and advice, but this isn’t it, due to it being off topic. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 08:56:17
I think we all know that it will be used to target the average person though, not the multinationals. They seem to have an agreement with HMRC. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 09:03:46
Irrelevant, my point is and always has been, this is a bitcoin sub, eth, xmr etc.  are altcoins. 
Your post was and still is off topic. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:22:28
Do you know what “aka” means?
Your post makes no sense to me. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:27:05

Your understanding of what bitcoin is is fundamentally flawed. 
You seem unable to grasp the fact that there are many altcoins but only one bitcoin, BTC. 
I appreciate the time it took to reply to my comment, but all it does is reinforce the fact that you don’t understand the bitcoin vs altcoin reality. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:03:13
More of a silver wizard to be honest. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:43:17
I didn’t make any judgement on privacy. 
My point is that the tax will likely not come from Google et al as you suggest. 
Corrupt multinationals strike private deals to avoid paying the tax they should, this has been well documented in recent years. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 08:09:05
This is the second post I’ve seen in two days that talks about “withdrawing” bitcoin. 
If it refers to taking your bitcoin from exchange to wallet it would make sense. 
But if you’re selling bitcoin for fiat, then that’s what your doing, selling, not withdrawing. 
Sorry for my rant, but this only leads to confusion when trying to help as I saw in a previous post. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 10:02:13
So, by that logic, movies are meant to be stored on film and stacked in cans. 
But they’re mainly digital now. 
I don’t understand the point you’re making. 
Can you expand a wee bit?

Your phone is not a safe place to keep your seed written down. 
I would suggest at least two handwritten copies kept in safe places. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:06:07
I wasn’t just referring to the OP to be honest, it’s just that I’ve seen the term “withdraw” being used for transferring and selling recently. 
I don’t think the term suits bitcoin transactions and can cause confusion. 
That’s all :)
Edit: OP does refer to moving to account, not wallet, that adds to confusion. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:55:00
I thought that too, I commented because I didn’t want the rest of the world thinking that us Scots don’t have heating. When I’ve been working in the States I’ve wound people up who genuinely believe we live a primitive life without TV, technology etc. 
I tend to respond with us running round mountains in our kilts trying to catch a haggis for supper. The sad thing is that my story is often believed. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:44:25
I think you’re right to be cynical. 
Wherever mainstream finance is involved if there is a very large pot of money you can be guaranteed that greed and corruption are never far away. 
It’s not as if rules and regulations have never been bent before. 
I’d like to see bitcoin price take a hike up as much as the next man, but I don’t get the warm fuzzies from any ETF either. 
@_date: 2019-09-15 13:01:39
My bank did this after declining the first payment to an exchange once. A call to the bank got one of the payments refunded quickly. I hope it’s this simple for you.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:23:09
I read this post maybe a week ago and didn’t believe it then either.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:34:20
You might want to allow multiple acceptable answers, I gave up when I couldn't give two valid answers for storage method. Sorry about that.

For one thing, this sub is a bitcoin sub, posts should be bitcoin related. If there were no mods then this sub would be flooded with the sort of lies and propaganda you can see everyday on r/btc. 
There is quite a difference between the financial freedom that bitcoin gives and freedom of speech which is easily abused. 
If this sub had no moderation I’m pretty sure it would drive away a large proportion of its users. 
From my experience I have seen numerous posts with constructive criticism here. However to avoid moderation they tend to be well written and backed up with verifiable facts. If they contain anti bitcoin propaganda then they will likely be deleted. 
I for one am glad that the mods do their job. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:55:03
You’re probably right, I was just thinking that where there is big money in one place, greed and corruption are never far away. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:45:55
I’m not sure work is a good place, but yes different places is a good idea. 
Perhaps with parents or siblings, someone you trust. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:35:16
I can read graphs just fine thanks.
 
My point is your use of “aka” (also known as) turns your headline into a bit of a word salad, although I think I know what you’re getting at. 
A little more body text may have been helpful to get your point across. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:40:57
And I thought you posted this because you agreed with it. 
You just redeemed yourself.  
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:59:21
Get yourself a wallet and you’re ready to accept.

Just thought I’d add, the vast majority of homes here in Scotland do have central heating, the most common set up is a natural gas boiler pumping hot water through radiators. 
Electric central heating is not so common, it’s pretty inefficient. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:09:06
I’m guessing you posted this crap just for shits n giggles.
If I’m wrong then I’m pretty sure you you must have posted in the wrong sub. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:50:32
Horrendous, sick stuff I agree, but you can’t blame bitcoin for these evil deeds. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:00:40
I agree, if wealthy individuals and corporations paid their fair share, the burden on Joe Bloggs would be lessened. 
Then there would probably be no need for these invasive measures which I fear may just be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to loss of privacy. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:23:55
Only on special occasions. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:19:09
I’m still not sure that an ETF is a good idea for the long term success of bitcoin. 
My fear is that bitcoin price manipulation will go in the same direction as silver and gold paper trading. 
Funds will, more than likely, hold less bitcoin than they claim to, this may create a massive problem in years to come. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:19:58
AFAIK it’s only Americans that spell cheque as check. 
Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand still use the “correct” spelling. 
You’d be surprised how often organisations like utility companies, taxman etc still issue them here in the UK.  
I think they are hoping they won’t get cashed, which is often true. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:28:34
Bitcoin is not “an idea”. 
It is Bitcoin, there is only one.

I agree, this is a similar pattern that we’ve seen during previous pumps. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:42:09
Bitcoin is global. 
The actions of one country will not crush it. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:31:33
I’ve only seen the OP using it so far, but I get what he’s implying every time I see it. 
Keep it up LegendsRoom.

I guess we will soon see lawyers specialising in blockchain transactions if there is a need and the lawyers can make money from disputes. 
Until then I think caution is the best solution. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:09:38
Fair point, but he may be confusing others that have yet to learn about cryptos and blockchain tech.

You’d be amazed at the number of posts that use a decimal point as a separator.  It gets helluva confusing in here sometimes.

It’s probably up to the individual to employ a lawyer to draw up a contract for large purchases. 
I don’t see why you would want any government involved. 
Just my tuppence worth.

Bitcoin is not exclusive to the US, although a newcomer to this sub could be fooled into believing it is purely an American product. 
I have nothing against the US, but it gets a bit tiring seeing posts that only consider US policy relating to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:08:17
Is there anything the mods can do to stop this sub being inundated by these out of date, irrelevant posts. 
I’m guessing the majority are posted by bots. 
When looking at new posts it’s a real pain.

I don’t know anything about that, would you care to enlighten me?
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:30:08
I’m not arguing, your second fact, whilst true, is a little blinkered considering bitcoin is obviously global.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:12:32
That’s interesting, but going back to your original post I wouldn’t have considered Norway a candidate for a currency implosion in the very near future. If they do I’ll buy you a pint by way of an apology then.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:58:54
Norway has a Sovereign wealth fund that greatly outweighs its national debt, so that looks unlikely. 
They could pay off their debt easily without printing money, unlike USA for example.
@_date: 2019-05-31 09:21:09
Do you really think bitcoin is only bought in the US?
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:13:32
TGBEX did a few nice coins, but are no longer trading. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:05:49
I know it is, but that money is already earned and invested.  Norway is in a pretty good situation financially. A drop in oil prices wouldn’t kill the Kroner.
