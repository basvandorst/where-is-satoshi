Congress+Trump just invalidated a big SEC regulation so don't feel any word out of the SEC is final.

So "recognised as such by the appropriate enforcement bodies" could be achieved if say the US gov uses a blockchain proof-of-existence; and that proof is then used in court.

Yep. and when he started on the alien stuff I thought it was some analogy, maybe a long joke; nope he's serious. Crazy crazy.
BitcoinMeister believes that stuff or just going along for the interview?

Bitcoin is like an IPO even more so now. Only the insiders (the tech savvy) will get in at low prices. The rest of the public will get access when it is 'safe' and by then very very expensive.

It seems like a really bad idea to take transactions off the blockchain. The security of the blockchain hinges more each day on miners being paid for their hash power. Each day the reliance on tx fee's increases for that needed hash power.
We're not looking to handle 7 billion users overnight. It will take time and the blockchain will have organic growth to meet that demand.
Thinking about this further.. LN and any other off-chain concept seems to be a pretty large change in the economic design of bitcoin, its use and the security of the blockchain.

In what way more risk, the timing of a trade? Or do you mean theft?

Seems plausible.
But we are seeing higher lows on the chart. A definitive upward trend.

Why are trades on LocalBitcoins at a premium compared to online exchanges?

They'll all explore creating their own blockchain. Then finally realize, huh, using the existing blockchain is far more secure than they could ever make a private one.
