The problem with bitcoin is that it's very hard to do real time USD/bitcoin and bitcoin/USD exchanges unless you're prepared to pay really really high fees.  
Look [here]( for example, these guys would exchange USD to bitcoin in 5-10 minutes but at a 20% fees.  
On the other hand an exchange like [this one]( would take 2-3 days to process a buy order you paid from your bank account, and then take another 2-3 days to credit your account when you sell. ( and make you jump through more hoops than paypal does to get you verified).  
So no, unless you have an army of gypsies with crystal balls you're going to lose money.

This is the way.

No, Primecoin is CPU only. You'll see some guys selling ASICs of FPGAs for it but those are scams.  
Edit: Before you run off to install the miner, you should know it needs lots of RAM to mine competitively for sieves (basically large lists of prime candidates).

Yup, pretty hard to tell if he meant that ironically or he's one of the 'to the moon' fanatics.

Small market caps, but promising coins.

Fork or just rebrand?
Edit: news to me, i'm looking into it now, thanks for the info.

Google 'SHA-256 coins'. Block erupters aren't bitcoin only, they can mine any altcoin based on the same algorithm. What you can't mine are scrypt based coins like litecoin.  
Since you have very small hashing power in a block erupter look for sha256 coins with very low difficulty.

They're all the same, with about 300MH/s. If you're looking on ebay get the cheapest one you can get that isn't an obvious scam.  
If you buy more than 1-2 dont' forget you need a powered USB hub to run them. Same goes for the hubs, get the cheapest no-name one you can get, they're all the same.

VPN access should be enough, a lot of people already have one for torrents.

Primecoin might work long term, since mining it provides useful results (ie prime numbers). [This guy describes it pretty well](  
1. Not a pump and dump scheme (think Auroracoin).  
2. Reasonably competent developers (not generic altcoin clone).    
3.It's also pretty stable in price (~ 0.07-0.08$ in the last 2 years). Edit: market cap is also pretty stable at about 1 mil. It's a fly compared to the bitcoin elephant, but it's still there after 3 years, which is quite important.

Any coin that's truly anonymous will get crushed by state pressure. It doesn't matter if it's the US, Japan or Germany, you can't mess with state level resources. Darkcoin just vanished for example.

Doge is well and truly dead. The guys running it drained everything they could from it and funneled the money to 'charities' they controlled.  
I'm surprised a scam of that scale wasn't investigated... but i suppose since Butterfly Labs got away with 10 million in scam money, everything is possible.
