OP is waiting on a wire transfer.
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:13:01
I don't think your comment warranted a tl;dr
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:21:11
44 in dog years?

Google says Bitcoin isn't something that will go under $5k ever again.

I would move it to a blockchain.info wallet myself, others would tell you to move it offline.

They have been reaching their "daily limit" very rapidly everyday lately. Hopefully they significantly increase their limit soon because I really like the convenience... 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:49:35
I'll take that bet
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:07:54
0.00000000000000000000001 to be exact.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:19:09
They don't even talk about cryptocurrency there, all they talk about is chickens... 
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:44:23
So what's the scam?
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:54:33
Thanks for the 0.1 BTC. Love the site. Have only played blackjack though. Might try out some video poker in the near future but blackjack is where it's at for me for now.
Just as a suggestion. Any thoughts on being able to customize the wager buttons in the future. I know you can just type in the wager values, but being able to customize the buttons would be amazing. Not sure how easy it would be to implement in HTML5 though.
@_date: 2013-03-19 02:18:51
But it's fully loaded at least... 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:05:44
You got those coins :P
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:55:56
How'd it work out for you?
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:47:14
I am not usually.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:26:25
I don't get it... 
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:14:09
I think you mean 20 mBTC ;)
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:55:13
Nm, I read the conditions again and was thinking of it backwards.
You are correct. I would PM FredEE.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:42:37
I would try and take it up with Coinbase. The same thing happened to me and I was able to cancel a second time without issue. (Although now that the price is 50 bucks higher I wish I would have kept the order in...)
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:06:52
You could cancel the order if it skyrockets...
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:24:41
You meant March 29th I assume instead of May 29th?
@_date: 2013-03-14 02:12:36
Is this real life?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:26:32
Just keep trying.
@_date: 2013-03-19 02:17:50
I don't get it, but I upvoted it anyway! 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:13:29
What are their deposit options?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:21:48
Man, I am confused now. What does this have to do with my comment?
@_date: 2013-03-14 12:56:26
Is this gonna be forever?
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:41:03
Contact Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-03-19 02:16:29
Great movie. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:52:19
No, more like 0.25 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:30:29
Also, if you do check the box, you have the option to cancel the order up until Coinbase receives the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:06:19
Electrical Engineer here, just getting started into Bitcoin. I watch the charts constantly. Was looking into Bitcoin about a year or so ago but never actually bought any, sure wish I would have bought a buttload then...
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:27:00
@_date: 2013-03-15 13:38:09
Just bought my first BitCoin from Coinbase and have an order in now for a couple more. Awesome service. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:49:18
ytcracker represent
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:58:11
Or you could base it off of a different exchange like bitstamp...
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:04:21
Probably as you have already given them authorization to.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:04:53
I think he meant in regards to your OP. He has already told his friends.
@_date: 2013-09-18 02:50:42
Except the service won't have access to the rest of your Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 12:31:47
Actually they were wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:20:41
No, that's only if you check the box agreeing to those terms.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:29:31
Yes there is. If you don't check the box and Coinbase is still selling Bitcoin at market price for the day (aka they haven't reached their "daily limit"), then you will get the Bitcoin for the market price.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:21:35
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:28:12
Sounds like your account was hacked...
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:07:54
Agreed. I just bought my first BitCoins in the past couple weeks. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:04:19
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:25:38
Pretty sure I just bought one yesterday...
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:11:21
I think you mean your 20 mBTC unless you really meant .002 mBTC
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:33:10
I figured as much. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:32:05
This is awesome! Now to finally buy some Bitcoins... 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:26:07
50 namecoins is worth about 1/4 of a bitcoin right now on btc-e
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:21:01
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:30:46
Where's FredEE when you need him? :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:44:17
The custom amounts one.
