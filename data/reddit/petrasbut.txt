+1 for this. Supporting small business generates jobs and a sustainable community.

Yep... money creation is an avoidable taxation where everybody get taxed by getting their money devalued.
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:43:33
Huh...I guess this is very difficult to happen since the fee is distributed among the workers for a miner pool, therefore, they cannot 'return the fee'.
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:47:10
That might raise some suspicion upon miners whereas those fake high-fee TXs would seem valid. "Wow we are getting a lot of volume on the blockchain recently. We might need to raise the fee".

I think it is pretty clear.

I have a ATI 2900 HD XT..... Can I go mining?
I couldn't get any mining soft. that worked. 
@_date: 2011-05-10 16:05:34
Isn't this bad for the environment?
@_date: 2011-05-10 11:48:18
You have to destroy it after use? 
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:35:07


Nice number.
@_date: 2011-05-19 16:11:08
Do this with "redBit" where the "B" is a coin.
@_date: 2015-11-24 01:17:18
Great idea.

100,000 yen?
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:14:05
Let me see if I've got it... 
Does it mean that I can buy a billion $ worth of hardware to mine bitcoin and force-feed the price of the coin on you? Just because I've spent all this money?
If a miner is spending more than it is earning just shutdown some nodes. If the price goes up you re-start them again.
The difficulty will adapt accordingly.

I think that everybody need to chill the fuck out and stop wasting money on ASICS... 
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:04:03
If everyone were still mining with CPU only would the difficult drop at all?
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:34:04
I guess everyone would like to mine on their PCs. 
My point here is: We are facing a steadily increase in energy consumption and this don't give us much benefits. This only drive non-ASICS out of the game.
Am I tripping balls?

From pictures you can see that they are grouping all the wires into a massive eth cable. I believe that is the reason, you remove the shielding to group all cables together. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:07:44
Great! Thanks a lot.
Transaction fees will be great incentive for mining in the distant future. Imagine fees from ALL transactions in the world.
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:36:38
I think that this race to HASHPower is very negative. I know that there is nothing to do about it but as difficulty goes the only thing that I see is people spending MORE money on bigger hardware that consumes MORE energy.
Life would be easier if everyone agree to mine using CPU only. But that never gonna change.
Does that make sense?

Post your ideas on the blockchain.

What we need is a cooperative of credit where you get informed that your money is being borrowed by someone.
