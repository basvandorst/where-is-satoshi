You are thinking short term, assuming you live through this terrible time period, once the powers that be are out of the way with them intentionally keeping things bad for people in general, just by their policies they pursue intentionally,  lifespan increasing, with standard of living increases above inflation, and economics going off the scale due to that, a very expensive coin becomes an easy to envision trivial matter ...

govt employees who are well paid brought into the cryptocurrency to assist and be there as a mindless audience to cheer the demise of bitcoin on have plopped in money as needed to influence idiotic dupes such as yourself into thinking everything that have done at the foundation level to wreck bitcoin will be okay and completely accepted as good in their puny minds.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:54:45
Just move your coin to an account that allows it to be accessed by a debit card.
There are also companies that are trusted that merchants can trust, that is between reputation and the business.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:51:51


Cash will get to the block reward halving much sooner, scarcity on the cash chain, perhaps in just a few months ...
so around the time of the holidays, coincidentally around the time of your forked chain over here:
Bitcoin inflation rate per annum:	3.89%
Bitcoin inflation rate per annum at next block halving event:	1.73%

You are talking about transitioning from low fees to higher fees significantly.

If blocks are large enough enough txs can be there and enough value of the coin at that point and it sustains quite nicely for a very long time ....

so anyway you can get diethylamine quite easily from deet insect mosquito repellent
take deet water alcohol and a hydroxide base and seal it up like in a pressure cooker and heat it
			
allow to cool and distill off the diethylamine let it set on hydroxide for a few hours and redistill to get diethylamine

I got one. Well, I don't due to unforeseen circumstances. But I would have in some other circumstances and situation. Or it could have been a nice house in Hawaii with a bomb shelter out back. But it doesn't really matter now, as I get seasick anyway; imagine charting the course with your eyes closed? Too tough, see? So what I did is had the us govt make a huge picture (artwork) of a yacht and drive it by me (a mobile yacht) when I was on new york ave in wash DC.

Yeah and all these things are to be blamed on roger ver, when he was responsible for none of them. LOL. What a hoot.
People should really pay you money for this one.
And then, with a massive crisis right up ahead, you took everything and went back in full bore. Hahahaha.

lysergic ester salt - diethylamine or lysergic ester salt in alcohol and diethylamine with slight elevation of temp
recrystallize or use celluslose or starch for column with alcohol as solvent as the salt
			
now if extract is needed for precursor defat morning glory seeds ground up then use acid extract freebase separate extract back into tartaric to form salt for conversion to ester
use anhydrous conditions with acid exchange resin in methanol
as the salt
						
the freebase is unstable so always try to make it work with the salt or then you have to use ridiculous air free techniques.			
the lysergic skeleton is a variation of hunigs base attached to indole explains why it is so unstable in normal atmosphere.
the amide to ester is in a patent for the seed alkaloid
keep the lights low or use aluminum foil to exclude light from reaction vessel.

I am all down and in favor of 2nd layer solutions to assist as an adjunct to a full scaling solution, but you have to get to that securely, and segcrap is not that path.
A 2nd layer is only part of the full scaling comprehensive package that can be developed over the next several years ...
2 megs as a proposed blocksize increase only buys you approx 6 months and you are right back at this problem, you need to buy yourselves at least 3 years to develop and test the scaling ideas.
I will be happy to explain in detail why a larger blocksize increase will work, as I know many of you dont have modern computers, you have 5 year old cheap things, with cheap bandwidth, when I started I had 4k of memory ....we are all daisuke's.

So blockstream raised a certain amount of money; Roger exceeded that in less than a year by starting a mining company between his company and the miners; makes you wonder where blockstream's long term vision is, did they really think the community was going to allow them to stranglehold bitcoin for themselves?

The scaling of bitcoin most likely will be from a convergence of factors. Some ideas are 2nd layer solutions, compact/block headers, and the cpu and bandwidth may have breakthroughs.
