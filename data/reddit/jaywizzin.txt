I can instantly tell you've never actually been on these websites considering, Silkroad, for example did not have "contract-killers" or "violence" or child pornography openly for sale.

Oh, wait, are you serious?

I can agree with this. You won't be using Dark Market to buy groceries, lego sets, books, models, or gardening supplies.
It will be solely for banned or illegal goods. (Drugs and gun parts probably)

So the same oppressive regime that is preventing sales of certain goods is going to let people freely mail possibly illegal items to it's citizens without any questions or invasion of privacy? Sorry, I don't see that happening easily.
The packages can be tracked, checked, and intercepted so easily.

Holy shit you are dense. People can use computers to access child porn. You can view child porn from your cell phone now. OH! You can create child porn using the video recorder on a cell phone too!
You can abuse technology in all sorts of ways, so banning the technology does nothing. Without Dark Market the child porn loves will just find a substitute and remain anonymous.
This technology doesn't magically create more child porn, it's already out there in quantity. Pedo rings get busted every now and then spanning many countries. If Dark Market is used to distribute child porn, you can guarantee law enforcement will find a way to get to them. No matter how much the developers say it is protected.

FreeMarket is an equally terrible name. Like Freedom Fries. Freedom Toast.
Just fucking terrible and sounds like a 15 year old came up with both names. 
"oh, FreeMarket? Wow, it conjures up such beautiful images of the inalienable natural rights of humans and free-thinking and free-trading of goods and market demand! So amazing and righteous."
More like awful. "Silkroad" now that was a good name. I never used it but the Silkroad was an actual trading route and it's name told you exactly what the website was about if you're halfway intelligent.
A creative name for this new project that gets the same point across would be better. However, it's not my project to name, so whatever.
I'd name it after whatever road the Nazi's used to transport their supplies. Super anti-status quo.

I never had any issues of stumbling on to child porn on TOR or bittorrent. If you don't want to see it, you won't.

Uh, people who spend with cash aren't looking to make it more complicated by making online accounts and buying and selling bitcoins, and having a bitwallet with them.
I spend cash because it's easy and if I'm tipping, bam the person can just put it in their pocket and spend it wherever and however.

If service is bad or food is bad, I don't tip anyway. If my water doesn't get refilled, I don't tip. If they don't ask about my meal and if the food was to my standard, I don't tip. I don't care if your wages are from tips, get a new job if it bothers you. I am definitely not going to tip just because you feel like you are entitled to a certain percent of my meal cost. This is exactly how most people I know view it.

In my area the coinstars take 12%.

Ahahaha, be discrete so that this bitch can get rich quick by scamming people on here who want 15 minutes of fame.
