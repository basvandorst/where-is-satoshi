But the difference there is that those are legal, licensed content, and some small amount of that money goes back to the creators. This is just paying people to upload content, whether they own the rights to it or not. It's monetized piracy. 
I have netflix for the same reasons you mentioned. It's easier and more convenient than downloading. But mega isn't remotely close to the same thing.
I'm not saying mega couldn't eventually become a good source to download entertainment legally, but right now, it isn't. Until it is, I'll get my pirated content for free.

Simple, but in a world where most of the same content can be found for free, why would anyone pay at all?

2 years ago, Satoshi reappeared on the p2p foundation website (where he unveiled bitcoin) and said "I am not Dorian Nakamoto." It shouldn't be that hard to make another post stating "I am Craig Wright." But that won't happen, because Wright is not Satoshi.

It's cool, but at that point, isn't it just buying things with fiat + more complication? Most businesses have coinbase pay them in fiat, and the funds would just come straight out of your bank account. 
Genuinely curious, what makes this better than just paying with your bank account?

Think about it from a worker's perspective. I'll use a waitress here. 
You get $2 and change per hour, and the rest of your wage has to be made up by tips. There is a standard amount of 15% that most people try to tip, so it's expected. Someone comes in and gets $29.42 worth of food, gives you $30, and tells you to keep the change. 
In a culture that expects people to tip in those circumstances, it comes off incredibly insulting; someone doesn't want to tip, but doesn't want to deal with the coins, so they leave an insignificant amount of money for the waitress to deal with instead. 
I've never worked as a waiter, but I've had a lot of friends and girlfriends who worked for tips. Most agree they'd rather not get a tip than have to grit their teeth and say "thank you" to someone after working their ass off for 58 cents.

Officially, the law states that if your wage and tips don't add up to the federal minimum wage, your employer has to make up the difference. The reality, though, is when you tell your employer they need to cover you because you aren't making enough in tips, they immediately start looking for reasons to fire you. 


Because they aren't expected here. I don't comment on reddit as a job and don't expect compensation for doing it, so any tips from changetip would just be a fun bonus. I was just explaining to the previous user how a small tip can appear insulting, in the context of American society. 
I think the tip based wage system is stupid too, for what it's worth.

There's an update that says the three guys were getting served, and the marshals were just there to keep the peace.

Doubtful. One of the biggest things Bitcoin has going for it is the limited rate of new coin creation. Doge doesn't increase difficulty as more people mine it, so they are essentially flooding the world with their currency. Maybe, given enough time, the value could increase after the total amount of doge has been mined, but I think it'll be too late then.

I had one come by my house a few weeks ago asking about my retirement plans (I'm in my late 20s). I mentioned that bitcoin has been pretty lucrative, and he said he hadn't looked into it. I asked if any of their plans could provide a return of 5000% on the initial investment like mine did, and that was the end of the conversation.

The online side might, but I think a lot of retailers won't put it in physical stores for a while. Most people don't know what a bit coin is, and I wouldn't expect the average low-wage store clerk to learn about paying with a currency they've never heard of.

No, they aren't. They're very similar, but in most definitions a psychopath is a mentally ill person that has violent tendencies. A sociopath may have difficulty empathizing with others and even be manipulative (and may even be a psychopath), but not every sociopath is violent, and not all people with violent tendencies due to illness are sociopaths.
The term "psychopath" has fallen out of medical usage because its overuse made it too much of an umbrella term, which becomes less meaningful as we understand mental illness and come up with newer, narrower diagnoses for specific conditions. 
But in any case, the words aren't interchangeable.

No, it isn't. This is the fee Turbo Tax (a private company) charges to process and deposit your refund faster than the IRS will. That's why on the left it says "Refund processing service." Also notice all the other options mention your refund is deposited or mailed by the IRS, while that one doesn't. 
The IRS has absolutely nothing to do with that fee. It's a way for Turbo Tax to bilk morons out of $35 to have their refund sooner. Also, you may want to consider hiring an accountant.

Especially damning is the fact that Satoshi hasn't said anything on the P2P foundation site, even though he did back when Newsweak accused Dorian Nakamoto of being Satoshi. All he would need to do is post "Yes, I am Craig Wright."

And you deader than Google buzz or Google+
There's a road made of silk if you must
Get your hustle out a chemical rush
avoiding a brush with the law
Can't stop em all cause they got it anonymous
The ones that play it stupid they get thrown in a bottomless pit
Don't even know how to cut up them layers
Of the .onion so let the players play pumpkin
