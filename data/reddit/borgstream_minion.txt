I have a few envelopes here behind me about banks I've sometime had business with, that now want me to send updated copies of passports and stuff. They also send reminders about previous mailings, but never acknowledge when they've recieved something, to make sure I don't know if they still want something or if it's fine already. And if I call the support line it takes forever and it usually ends up with that I need to do more work myself, visit a branch, call a special office within some very limited hours.

Currently extremely cheap. Set the fee manually to 5sat/b if you're doing the tx anytime soon. 5sat is the red field here  and if you go into read you're way above current minimum. On the other hand, coinbase often push the fees above 1000sat. So always check before making a TX. Most wallets still aren't too good at this.

Come back when Satoshi SPV clients are built - one of many bitcoin.pdf near misses. Unless your call-to-authority was intended, think a bit about attack vectors on bitcoin. Or leave bitcoin in the niche market "actually pretty secure" and use some coins that care less about security. It seems the market, both smart and very stupid money, still prefers BTC. But when XRP falls 90% or some PoS coin gets a long range attack and is obliterated, expect renewed regulatory pressure.

Heads up; we're agreeing here. I was making fun of user friendliness.
The scary part is, that even if we're so lucky to have an ebay seller who really understands the product they're selling and knows right from wrong, they might still be forced through competition to create a maximally userfriendly = minimally secure product-solution and have an uphill battle to convince users to do things the hard way.

Exactly. The seller probably just wanted to be friendly, and created a more user friendly experience than what the more hardcooked hardware wallet supplier wanted people to fall for. And then that ebay seller got "hacked".

Do you send gummibears together with your transactions, or how do you get the VIP treatment?
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:36:41
Well... maybe some ebay seller decided to make a more userfriendly solution, helping the user to not have to spend time with initializing and stuff. A HW wallet that's safely and correctly initialized, with keys stored under scratch-off sealed archival grade paper printouts, in several copies, is still safer than say just a paperwallet. Unless the seller gets "hacked" and looses the full list of private keys he had made a safety backup of. "For customer support purposes."
Not saying this is what happened here. Even if police investigate, it probably won't be possible to prove anything.

We had 1 apple, 0 IOUs, and ended up with 1 apple and 2 IOUs? So 2 whole IOUs (debt) were created out of nothing. In general, this is how non-narrow money is created. Google it.

"instant" and "confirmed"
Still cen be reversed, although for the DMV the rate of credit card fraud is probably pretty low. Which means it's practically robbery to tack on the fees that OP is describing for such a "secure" transaction. They even have video archived of OP:s visit to their registry!
Compare that with selling model trains via anonomous bag drop at the local park or by mail without return address because you don't want to risk getting robbed by your buyer (or vice versa). It's not even possible (eh.. I mean allowed) to use a credit card for that.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:26:55
I wonder if there is some market data on this happening. We've already had a raise from ~700k to 1000k and just now SegWit adding additional space for transactions. Did fees go down as you'd expect from your statement?
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:14:54
And why not. Japan probably didn't have any credit card fraud to begin with and the government seized MtGox coins and needs to offload them somehow.

On the other hand, BCH people appear to prefer stupid bitcoin transactions, with minimal encryption, and loads of transactions such that only miners can run a big enough node to handle it, and so that any small miners or pools would be at a disadvantage. Repulsive. But the metadata intel from running such a big mining pool is probably worth reselling to TLAs worldwide.

The 2008 vs 2005 thing is because Nick re-posted some articles on his blog, which changed the dates. If that was on purpose or just a confusing side effect is anyone's guess. Though Nick doesn't seem like the kind of guy who hunts for acclaim for his person, so he might not care at all about what dates are attached to his blog posts.

Which companies? Answered on the wrong thread?
I though I was helping your side of the argument. See, it started with a typical he said, she said between likely AXAborgstreamers, here: 
Then I interjected that Roger might have revealed his hand by mistake, simply slipping up in Coin Control and opsec. Maybe used a wallet without Coin Control, or if he just doesn't use any features above the original 0.1 bitcoin. Rumor has it, that Mircea's minions made a polished turd out of the original code dump, that til this day still runs, witout any of the poison that the core corporate takeover people added, as one could formulate things.
Then you agreed with me, giving the bitcoin-proponents another slap in the face. High rButtcoin-five on that! But then I sat and made it rain on your parade, saying it might be ignorant to think that cold hard cash, followed closely by bitcoin and careful opsec, is the two most anonymous methods of value transfer there is today. Bearer bonds is so drag-the-dragon-family-to-court last year.
And then you answer by taking a dump on PoW?

Sorry, badly written comment. I wanted to roundabout make fun of the anti-scientific approach to deciding how to upgrade blockchains. Which I think agrees with the point Nick intended to make. Re-listening to the Tim Ferris interview now to see if I misunderstood it the previous times I listened or read it.
What did you think was meant? Or think that kingo86 meant? That Nick tries or wants to referee and decide over developers?
As to the _Which_ - obviously you should take in all the research and engineering output that is produced and use your own brains. I agree this is hard, since you need good abstract and systems understanding, or understand who understands it. Protip: typically not the guy who's screaming the loudest while paying others to help with the screaming.

User adoption of ln is likely to not be super fast. See how people are slow to start using SegWit. Few companies made the effort. Maybe when core makes segwit addresses the default for new addresses and spare change, then it will happen automatically. But for lightning, no adoption can come simply from automatic software updates. User dialogs and API calls must be made differently. Slow start to be expected, until we figure out one or some killer apps for LN.

Consider this: if money was not state-controlled, and at least one country anywhere in the world was not repugnant and/or agressive against immigrants, then it would become fully doable to vote with your feet.
How would you like a government that has an actual limit to their powers? Or a country where the only weapons and violence monopoly is controlled by the economic power of its citizens, rather than its lobbyists and robber barons.
If you're a totalitarian leader, you should oppose (hyper)bitcoinization.

This is the easiest explanation. The date and the actions were realistically already at least partly paid for, so by canceling, there likely wouldn't be a next time. And a next time S2X is at least out there, as a github repo and a rumor. Miners have money, wants power.

In general, you move everything you can to higher up layers 2, even 3 and onwards, when possible and when security isn't too negatively affected. Where a transaction or contract fits in can be a case by case basis, and good wallets will suggest and allow advanced users to learn more and adjust manually.
Bulletproofs is an improvement on CT, and they are being developed to be used on level 1, on chain.
Schnorr is more related to coinjoin (see also zerolink) and will help to condense transaction _signatures_.
MAST can enable bigger scripts to be spent without revealing (and paying fee for) the full script; just the minimal parts needed to get the exact same result as revealing the whole script would. A help for fee and blockchain bloat reduction, that also allows more privacy and obscured contract safety valves, useful say if one contract participant disapperas.
Most of these technologies can be combined in more complicated ways than is being done. And if you'd start out from scratch, maybe MimbleWimble would've been a cleaner base to build everything else on. But Grin development seems to take a lot of time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:00:04
So now you've realized why the miners were in a hurry to get more SHA256 PoW chains out there, preferably all with the Bitcoin brand, to maximise the miner's influence of this, from their viewpoint, moneyprinting business?

Which definition of "Blockstream" are you using here? Some who produce a lot are paid by, or behave like they're friends with Blockstream. Maybe Todd and Matt Corallo aren't currently employed there, if that counts.
Have you looked at the chat room logs and mail lists?
The Bulletproofs and some MimbleWimble tech are very hot and very likely to be adopted by bitcoin devs, but the tech came from outside. There are researchers who also produce proof of concept code that gets used. There have been complaints that Blockstream doesn't have a PR dep. that shows off what good is happening, to counter the "PR" from altcoins. I.e. please Blockstream, pump bitcoin more...eh...I mean show off your fancy new technologies and show you're a though and field leader in blockchain. Can I have more blockchain with my blockchain? Then there of course must be complaints when the technology that's not from blockstream gets used and showed off as something new, good, useful in bitcoin, when it was invented and mostly finished off elsewhere.
Likely the ideas were tested and discussed on the bitcoin mail list or cypherpunks maillist (one of many birthplaces of bitcoin/bitgold/e-cash/RPoWs). And some of the most frenzied cypherpunks work for Blockstream, so it seems realistic there will be a majority of good or best-of-breed solutions coming from there. Just like linux drivers built by the linux hardware driver contributors often are much much better quality than what some underpaid sidelined windows 95-schooled driver developer can patch up and compile. Ok, things are better now, but still in the last year a major GPU manufacturer shipped so bad drivers, that most linux distros have switched over to use the reverse-engineered open source drivers instead.
But, maybe you're not complaining about your general feeling, that it's unfair who gets to get their names in the limelight for new tech.
Maybe you have actual cases of tech built outside of the core- or Blockstream- group of people, that was technically better, more bug free, integrated better with other existing code, were better architected to enable faster and more qualitative future bitcoin development. And that Blockstream ignored it, out of spite, or ignorance?

Node hardware was never an issue. Maybe some uninitiated redditors confused or intentionally dumbed down, or plain misuderstood, that caused hardware per se to be debated at all.
* The bottleneck is and always was bandwidth/latency.
* Due to bad actors, pre-SegWit software is also to be avoided, since it's too easy to attack.
Does XThin (aka Compact Blocks prerelease) and IBLT à la Gavin (2014) work out for a complete P2P network and allow it to bootstrap itself if government starts cracking down on full nodes? Nope, as I remember. There was an idea about combining both bloom and Inverted bloom to create safer non-full node wallets, which was scrapped due to bandwidth (and secondarily, not ignorable, privacy issues). So, &lt;4mb still valid?
Maybe no: I think the recent conference had a block propagation solution that used bloom + inverted bloom, to actually allow both full nodes and safe non-full node wallets to be fully validating without loosing privacy. But I'd like you to convince me that you even knew about this, for instance by finding a youtube or pdf or github with anything about this. Worst case, I go back to chat logs and find it for you, but that way you'd loose some internet points.
SPV mining has caused monetary loss.
Current SPV wallets are not safe against government crackdown.
If you don't worry about anyone trying to shut down or censor bitcoin _ever_ then you have *absolutely zero reason* to not just use ACH/SEPA/Paypal instead. They're faster, safer (for you) and the fees are "0" i.e. externalised so you can imagine they're not there. But then you have nothing to do here, and I fart in your general non-cypherpunk direction.

Especiall since Calvin is so out of the loop, he posts on FB to "kill alts", while the riche-club method is dump BTC, pump any alts that are agreed upon so get even richer. And then take a dump on BTC again for good measure.

Thank you for saying that contracts / laws, social or not, should be broken if they are not making sense. That's activism; a way to upgrade govt/society without waiting for the status quo to willfully retire.
On the other hand, have you considered the bootstrap problem, at all? Maybe social, or otherwise, contracts are enough, but then why would we need PoW and blockchains? We could just decide together to stop doing fractional banking, currency wars, inflationary currencies?
What if everything else was already tried, and PoW that "wastes" electricity is the only way to keep bitcoin experiment participants honest?
What if the only thing preventing governments from goin full Jihad  on bitcoin nodes and devs is, that the bitcoin blockchain is small, fast and nimble enough to just pop up on new full, archiving, nodes if they try to shut down one node?
On the other hand, if you don't think PoW, fully validating, full archive is needed, you could just keep the UTXO-set and the latest agreed blockchain checkpoint, say the one Core or your preferred leadership supplies, and taking that a small step further, just get rid of blockchain, history, transparency and just use 0-conf on a globally shared UTXO database, hell why not just make it a IOU database and externalise risk to the on/offramps/exchanges and let them also handle KYC and any legal issues. Then it's already more inefficient, and less antifragile than current systems. And it becomes a tiny step to force users to go along with a fork "in the interest of national security" that shuts out unwanted parts of the world from participating in economical networks. Aka business as usual 2017.

There was not even an attempts at understanding crypto currencies and RSA and why PoW is the only thing that distinguishes a trustless chain from a permissioned ledger.

I would want to ask you for some juicy research that invalidates any of the things rbtc and BCH supporters seem to willfully and stubbornly ignore:
- max 4MB per 10 minutes, else the bitcoin P2P network as of last year *and* many years ago starts breaking down and decentralise
- Fully validating SPV doesn't yet exist
- the reason people stopped running full nodes is not that their upload bandwidth cap was maxing out
But I am a bit afraid it will get messy and uncover differing viewpoints of what can be counted as research. Oh well, maybe I'm feeling lucky, and can learn a second thing, if not a third, today.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:13:07
Mate, did you just now get 29 upboats? Your single rbtc post is "I want $1 bitcoin transactions". Do you have the broadband and latency there down under to cover for the blocksize that would be required to keep fees &lt;$1? Maybe the right solution is to shard bitcoin into several currencies, one per continent. I think we could easily rebrand BCH into "Bitcoin CHina", but for Oceania something like BAU or BOC perhaps could go, if the tickers are free. Of course, the security and censorship resistance will be lower if hash power is further split up among more different blockchains, but it's either that (less hashpower), higher fees, or we cancel the "limited coin supply". Oh, the last one was already kind of done with BCH, BTG and some previous airdrops.

UTXO-based chains fit nicely with:
* precommitments
* MAST for efficient smart contract enforcement
* pruning emptied smart contracts
* Simplicity for non Turing complete, safe-as-possible smart contracts
* folding signatures to both scale and get better privacy
* aggregate transactions on above-chain layers for scaling and privacy, while being secured and enforced by the base chain
Without these OTXO-related bonus points, cypherpunk won't win, but maybe live to fight another day. The future will be decentralised, and/or dystopic.
The "galactic credits" seen in sci-fi can be pegged to PoW UTXO blockchain tokens, or to some tracked and hackable gov't fiat currency. If I were an intergalactic trader, I'd avoid the fiat, or demand a higher price. We've seen Modi play out this scenario in India, so it's not all sci-fi anymore.

people keep registering new accounts (hi there, redditor for 1 week!) and then start poking at old scar tissue. It seems people are unhappy about how Gavin's bitcoin story developed, and talking about it brings a bad atmosphere, as well as a lot of repeting the same things over and over again.
Maybe if you consider this from the perspective of those who've been through this maybe hundreds of times already, are starting to have enough of it? I'm myself surprised there isn't just a wiki that a nullc_autoanswer_bot would link any 1 or 3 week redditor to, instead of typing out a real answer.

Yes, though the onion routing is used to keep the transaction secret from anyone except the sender and recipient. It might be possible to hide also this, even from a global passive adversary, so for the fun of the challenge, I'm suggesting there could be coinjoin/coinmixing services on LN:
1. open LN channel, maybe using up an output in full to keep the transaction lean. BIP126 HITs not relevant here since it's obviously a LN channel
2. pay from this channel into other LN-wallets or channels you control. To avoid these being linked together, multiple users could be adding funds to node which then pays out as instructed, just like some coinjoin protocols already do this.
3. the wallets are now several metadata steps away from you. Repeat 2. if needed.
4. to use the funds on actual spending, there might be a need to merge together funds from several "separate" LN-wallets. To avoid losing anonymity in this step, again use something like coinjoin

Where, if I may ask? I looked at bitcrust, and it seems you handed that repo over to another guy in May.
  - I take the opposing opinion; Rizun ignores the fact that miners already now do SPY and SPV mining, and the bad apples already now don't use core bitcoind to prepare mining headers, right? Maybe by making it possible for miners to have bitcoind internally, and a fully validating bitcoind node to which their internal nodes connect via a proteted/proxied/VPN:ed low throughput connection will make it easier for them to get through the Great FW of China. I'll keep this opinion until some real world measurements come and show one way or another. Rizun has, on average, negative credibility in my book. And I don't even want to start to guess why you've misunderstood and think that miners alone decide if blocks are valid. No miner can sell the coinbase of an incorrectly mined block, so it's their loss for the orphans they create if they get duped (rather, dupe themselves) into mining on invalid headers.

How do they compare? Some altcoins are on Shapeshift but missing on Changelly - does this mean Changelly has less liquidity, uses other exchanges, or is it just about operational costs? Of course Changelly might still be as quick or quicker than Shapeshift on getting bitcoin forks listed, but there will also be the point of safely splitting - a service that Changelly etc could perhaps provide. ping @_date: 2017-10-23 15:53:22

One point with avoiding s2x nodes already now, is to avoid a scramble to quickly dump s2x nodes and reconnect to other non-s2x nodes after the chainsplit happens. Bitcoin is about long term stability, more like gold, less of move fast and break things, and that means it's better to not risk losing a bunch of network connections in a confused mess when the split happens. s2x wants to force a hardfork, so getting their network up and working without leaning on non-s2x nodes should be the optimal choice, unless s2x wants to end up like the sorry mess BCH has created.
The other alternative is that s2x wants to do its best in killing non-s2x nodes, which seems directly hostile and then I can't fault non-s2x nodes from trying to isolate their non s2x network from such threats.

From which top? I count 4400 to 4300 -- or around 2.3%.
The $4480 top was extremely short-lived, low volume, and only on Bitfinex, while other exchanges never came seriously above 4400 at that occasion. "Nobody" traded up there at 4480.
Zoom in (timescale) on Bitfinex and you see the price flatlined with zero trades, followed by a price dump. Considering there are no other "oh we're doomed threads" it probably wasn't an organized attempt at manipulating the market.

Anything that isn't a softfork realistically must be shown as a branch. Try looking at github repos from the wrong perspective (looking from some random fork trying to understand the original) and you'll see it's too confusing. So the tree most start with the original chain. And if a new opensource team/project takes over, usually it also has to change the name. OpenOffice / LibreOffice for an example where the split (or "split") seems to be taking over as the better option.

All you guy can do, is keep repeating your talking points. I'm good at finding new angles which you seem good at ignoring? Maybe we're wasting each others' time. You guy don't get to define that time does not flow. Bitcoin's blockchain seems to prove that time flows, and that the hodge-podge solutions of 2009 are no longer the best solutions in 2017. By the way that's part of the reason why *all* of Satoshi's reference bitcoin code has been rewritten and replaced. Also as a way of de-risking from license, possible IP/patents, hidden underhanded coding tricks, and just pure naive/beginner-ishly badly written code. Satoshi was the first to not listen to Adam and others who said it won't work, and that bitcoin would be a waste of electricity while not reaching any reasonably high tps. It seems Satoshi was right on the one point that mattered; the bitcoin.pdf design (though not his code) *can* work, but it did need a couple of years of contributions from other believers, and generally stupid behavior from countries, i.e. mandating use of bitcoin for small personal purchases that are a cause for the majority of american prison sentences.

PS. If you don't care about price, why do you care how BTC scales? You have all possible scaling and non-scaling available. Scale-up in BCH, scale-out in BTG, scale-smart with Schnorr, scale-off in lightning (if you have patience), scale-squish with MimbleWimble (very beta) and the hordes of upcoming derivatives. You also have PoS (I keep forgetting if that means proof of scale or Proof of sh*t) and PoW-PoS mixes which are *guaranteed to require subjectivity* and governance altcoins like Decred, which is bitcoin with some fixes and an explicit governance model. If that means there's more or less efforts spent on trying to convince others they are wrong, or if time is instead spent on research and explaining, why don't you take a look yourself.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:13:18
Wait, what? Changing PoW without replay protection would be very disruptive. Miners would maximize their income by copying transaction between chains. BTG are likely too busy pre-mining in secret ("waiting" for replay protection to be built). They could try something like that. Or you could copy their code and chain and make an attempt yourself.
But no, without extreme consensus, something like that can't be done.
Moneybadger will ignore BTG and BT2x and next summer we'll have forgotten all about them, while new splits and maybe soon also some chain merges will threaten the chain with most consensus-compatible PoW.

It could be reasonable for Amazon to allow their merchants and subcontractors to choose to accept bitcoin, possibly with 2% rebate. For their internal transactions they can use GreenAddress / BitInstant style multisig tx:es with low fees, and cooperate with someone like BitPay to ensure merchants can get local money. Arbitrage into markets that may have goods but have a huge premium on bitcoin could happen. Amazon might also want to stop OB1 attracting the crypto riche.
To milk maximum PR value from this, they should accept BTC and ETH right now, and save for later to announce they have Lightning and other options available.

Don't worry. Of course there was mutual consent to drinking beer in a public place. And private agreements can be publicly bonded via commitment hashes, though right now it's a bit of a nuisance to make them up as you go. Low throughput etc. Some level 2 service needs to take on the bonding/escrow functionality because it can't all go onchain.
If the thesis idea takes off, all your sensor data could be stored in your exomemory (i.e. "phone") and made available to you quickly via your optical nerve.

Imagine if you could show the big money guys that you can get the crypto rebels to shut up and get in line, how much is that worth? Is this Barry's motivation? It probably seemed like an easy task with a big possible payout. And maybe 2x (i.e. more than the 4MB max block size that research has showed is acceptable) isn't going to centralise bitcoin and weaken its resistance to censorship, or erode the will to start using segwit transactions and scale out or scale off rather than scale up. What if 1-prefix transactions get quantum broken before people have migrated over to segwit or other 3-prefix? Sometimes the technical reasons for a software change can't be fully explained until after people have safely moved over.
Segwit1x is 2MB.
Bring on the whiners:
1. Can't run your own node? Use Bitstamp via an API-only "wallet” app!
2. Can't wait for wallets? Samourai! 
3. Can't pay the fees? Use cross chain tx to go in and out of the cheap chains for "spare change" transactions. Bitcoin will *never* scale on chain to include microtransactions. Satoshi was either partly stupid, or thought this would be casino/model trains/escrow only nerd money.

This diagram could sure have used more colors, but I hope you can figure out what the point is to avoid other colors? Hint: there is one main chain that has all the value and users, and then there are lots of "others". It's not a given this won't ever change, but trying to affect change by politicking seems to fail time after time, so maybe try doing something useful instead of something ingenious next time. Or maybe fork off, or use ACH or SEPA. There is no one-chain-fits-all, yet. With patience, BTC can become the SoV underpinning all other value-based networks, unless big-important-guys destroy it along the way. Are you using SegWit yet? If not, you have NO base for complaining about fees.

No. They can and should act like capitalist profiteers, and they are currently getting away with it.
Competitors have a good chance to take Xapo customers now.
Suggestions to value-add:
 - give users their coins on all chains within a week of any split (handling the replay protection via mixing in fresh coinbase coins from after the split)
 - default to spending in relatively equal amounts from all chains
 - let customers exchange bt1 (pre-split btc) and bt2 ASAP
 - shield user from turbulence, and take profits from that service. Welcome to take a bigger spread while things are volatile.
Any vertical integrator like Xapo can use so many different tricks to get better deals than a private user on an exchange, so Xapo and alike can publish small fees and still make big amounts.

It's a weaker form of PoW. If all used (were allowed to use) Asicboost, the actual "work" would be less than the advertised numbers. Open protocols *can not* depend on IP and licensing and legalese. And AB prevents some protocol upgrades and causes non-full blocs to be mined, as a side-effect of how it's most efficient to implement AB. Net effect is very bad for bitcoin. It's really interesting how it all plays out in the protocol - network interactions, you should read up on it! Ask if you need links :)

@_date: 2017-05-30 18:29:02
It'll depend on how the BTC1 code ends up.
jgarzik already canceled a pull request  that fulfilled the "segwit 80%" part and was claimed working, tested, and ACK-liked by many. But  like existing segwit, would hamper covert asicboost. And jgarzik has started on a more complicated pull  that still isn't working. (Also jgarzik had to cancel out some architectures that core supports but that started to fail on BTC1. I hope the code quality hasn't already started falling.)
One way to restrict use of asicboost is actually to keep blocksize small - because covert AB creates blocks with few or no transactions - and too much empty blocks makes bitcoin users migrate to other coins, making fees (and bitcoin price?) fall lower, and that might convince Jihan to use AB less and mine more real not cheated blocks.
On the other hand, I suspect that with the given minimal timeframe, they should just take existing SegWit code + BIP148 + a BIP148-style thing that also requires blocks after 1 Aug to be signaling for the fetisched hardfork, basically copy&amp;paste the short and sweet BIP148. 2mb fork is said to be possible to do simpler and nicer after SegWit, and the chinese "OBEC" can threaten to either orphan any blocks from Bitfury (and some "small change" pools) - or just mine empty blocks - if any among the anti BU/asicboost minority tries to prevent the 2mb HF or tries to prevent covert AB. But probably I'm misinformed, since jgarzik is doing some dance around in pull  with strange activation methods that all devs are saying will snag with other existing code causing the pull to become bigger and harder to test - and probably not make it before the deadline - or otherwise cause chain splits.

Remember, if PBoC can't get KYC on all Chinese bitcoinusers, they'll keep forbidding bitcoin withdrawals on any Chinese mainland-facing ecchanges.

Hey that throwaway guy you're talking to is, in relation to the average commenter here, nearly a bitcoin god. Just a heads up. You're still very welcome to dig out BIPs and read (for yourself). 
The issue here is that BTC1 can't make a BIP because their signatories don't know what they signed (i.e. didn't read the text!) and the only way for BTC1 to have a slight chance of not being soon forgotten as another centralisation failure is if they produce code that then (as tried and tested) the signatories will agree to run without looking it through.
Somehow they think it, in 6 months time, makes any difference *at all* which software they happened to run on their nodes this week. When in reality the past of any computer program or societal event or memory can only affect the future as context (input) to whatever software is going to be running then. Don't tell Jihan though, or he'll block BTC1 too!

The 4:1 discount is extended from being only for signatures to being applied also to Legacy transactions, whatever that means. Coming from I'm guessing legacy means any standard transaction to a 1-prefix or 3-prefix address that does not depend on witness data.

fragility or anti-fragility means nothing without a context.
The bitcoin context is to avoid splits at almost any cost, and always prefer an outage (people wait, and possibly use alternative means to complete a transaction) over a split (people lose money irrevocably).

What was said higher up is true - the increase to 2mb was added later to appease the HF fetischists, and by mistake (?) they broke covert asicboost, and now the Chinese can't admit openly to using asicboost and all kinds of illogical things happen. Jihan took a hint from the russian playbook and acts irrationally and randomly to try to hide his real intentions.
If we would give Jihan bigger blocks (=more fees) and allow him to keep face and pretent like he's not using asicboost, he and his 60-70% of hashing power would take it. Problem is that the ecosystem doesn't want such miner centralisation. So UASF or tarpitting the chinese mining pools are likely the only short-term options for Bitcoin to un-stagnate.

But that BU code was used long enough that nodes crashed left and right, at several occasions. And BU isn't the only "fire the good devs and take our code instead" team in this game of powergrabs, so expect more "bitcoin" nodes to come down crashing and burning in the years to come. Bitcoin, baby!

"intractable" and "pursuing further" seems like a scientist writing. I'd guesstimate that Nick didn't write that, Dorian also not.

Well, bumping blocksize would mean everybody gets the same "fee discount" - presumably. But a smoother transition as people move from 1-prefix transactions to using segwit, and then slowly unburdening the chain from microtransactions via LN and the roadmapped signature aggregations would instead make it steadily more expensive to spam the chain and discounting the fees for using the more secure and anonymous type of transactions.
There is a writeup of why the proportion chosen was 4:1 instead of 2:1 or 8:1. Read it if you care about useful anonymous transactions.
Or maybe we should just let Jihan give this bitcoin thing to his Chinese overlords, dump out coins. And the rest of us could fund and wait for more efficient and private coins like MimbleWimble or Algodan to mature.

A while ago this solar mining was "risky but WFM" when prices were around $1200? Then mining rigs likely went obsolete way faster than Dan expected (and you too, KnCminer?) and now he's "just breaking even" with btc prices &gt;$2000. Let's say you have too much money, so you can't put it all in S&amp;P 500 + BTC + retirement funds, then locking up some cash in non-liquid assets as are containers with solar panels on top probably starts becoming a good move. Or you could just do it because it seems doable. And a touch of blind trust in that bitcoin prices wil rise always helps.

Where did you even get that idea from? Someone told you? Was it a "redditor for 1 week" or some comment with lots of upvotes and high fives and no explanation of why things would work that way?


*YOU* don't know.


Sounds like you've mistakenly put an equal sign between ChangeTip (discontinued) and *a bunch of Lightning hubs*.
The one thing you've gotten right is that, *probably*, when LN becomes popular, even SegWit's effective blocksize doubling won't be enough. Careful though, a hardfork blocksize doubling would mean even lower sum(transaction*safety) per minute than SegWit. If you only care for count(transaction) I'd recommend you transact using Ripoff, just make sure to not buy any of their XMR scamcoins.

Dan could very well be using redditors as brainstorming help, to help with fleshing out ideas on how he should be building this stuff. I used to trust he's doing a lot of lettuce and not so much of minig as claimed. In his previous posts he talked about mining containerS and then proceeded to say he had one, or almost one, in production with more coming in from China soon-ish.
tl;dr Dan is probably partly selling his story before implementing it, getting help with which directions are worthwhile
OTOH, Elon Mush does excel sheets with physics calculations on the flight home from Moscow and then the team gets to build it. Who's to say Dan can't do excel sheets and put cheap Chinese labor on the task of fleshing it out to a functional container.

Congrats, you've earned the diagnosis "narcissistic", if you think Greg would put specific efforts into downvoting you. Maybe you might have some kind of "complex" too. The realistic way to percieve your surroundings and sensory inputs is to assume that everybody does, in a somewhat random manner, whatever they feel like and think they can get away with. Greg appears to be a person who likes to produce good software and spend vast amounts of efforts on helping people understand. Maybe no coincidence than he aspires to phyiscally look like the traditional image of a wizard, within limits of what society can accept.
Redditors presumably agreed to using up/downboats to help filter out spam and only spam, and anything that breaks rules should rather be reported to mods. This leaves trolling and stupidity without recourse, so you have to give some leave to the possibility that those who want to support Greg will downvote false narratives, talking points and ad hominems when they come across them. And any redditor who appears to behave intellectually dishonest (on purpose, or by mistake due to tiredness, stupidity, or inoculation from some authority entity) will likely attract somewhat unethical harassment, since there is no other recourse available to counter those who indefensibly try to "take a dump" on devs.

Minimalism &lt;-&gt; compatibility &lt;-&gt; fees.
Ultimate traveling card: Revolut. They've shown that the card industry in itself isn't totally stuck-up. Top-up via bank account in our own name, unless you have a UK home address, or can wait for Revolut to get their EUR bank license, maybe later this year.
Minimalism? Maybe Shakepay if it's out of beta. Or get one card that incorporates them all like Curve (Swyp/Coin/Plastc/similar?). The incorporated cards will still have to be ordered, paid, waited for and any monthly &amp; yearly fees, so the more cards and convenience you add, the more fees you'll pay.
USD is tricky. Not sure if all of the non-big bank USD denominated cards are accepted in all of the states.

LN is useful for your hotwallet, not so much for buying from exchanges.
Are you planning on buying BTC regularly and then spend it through LN payments for your expenses during the month?
You get very little anonymity, but you some protection from inflation, robbers or asset forfeiture. With bitcoin you pay the fees, with plastic the merchant pays, and for monthly expenses using bitocin might not be worth it.
Maybe if you use a - not yet built - centralised hotwallet service that connects with the exchange in a federated rather than decentralised network, allowing for payment channels with bigger sizes, faster transactions and less fees.

And this is why bitcoin either progresses gracefully, or not at all, which is also fine.

I'm not all in BTC and I can just jump ship when better tech matures.

Thank you for making an effort. I meant nih as in "not invented here". I meant it as a reaction to your first sentence, which appeared to claim that the various people contributing and reviewing code for the bitcoin github repository would care more about who contribute some code than the contents and open discussion about the contributions. I beg to differ.
I do agree with your second sentence - that btc1 is a fork. Both in the git sense and when it comes to how the chains being worked on would diverge or converge. I think that most every core contributor and other interested parties make a fork of bitcoin/bitcoin - more precisely 8540 forks registered on github.com and likely some 10-20% more that are not visible on github.

I heard Iota is a centrally controlled coin (it's how they prevent doublespends) with a big marketcap and lots of hype. Almost too good to be true. You can stick "bitcoin-tech" and "blockchain" stickers on it, and maybe it'll shine as brightly as bitcoin.
In short, the only relevant niche for bitcoin to fill, is in being the most decentralised and burnt electricity-protected blockchain. Any action pushing bitcoin away from that niche, makes bitcoin less valuable relative to other coins. Scaling "now!" or "too little too late" without 2nd level is not an excuse to make bitcoin more like the alts.

There's s sticky icky issue here; once the SEC has taken all the tokens, they can either declare them worhless and try to burn them, or sell them in auctions which causes those sold tokens to be 100% legally clean afterwards. So they might think twice before seizing tokens.

A dangerous weapon then, if BU people would wrap their hears around the spoonnet code?

Wow - great writeup. I didn't think of the detrimental effects of discussing also just remotely possible problems - current or upcoming. I must admit I stopped fully trusting several people who show a dismissive attitude to the science and reports coming out of core-supporting devs.
For the case in point, it seems it might be safe to assume good faith at least until SegWit gets activated. And I'll assume miners will be fine with deactivating asicboost as soon as it becomes unavailable to all miners, evening out the playing field.

US govt can affect (too much) pressure by making it hard or impossible to transact in USD.
BTC-E is funny in that it has some kind of banking relationship, but they also demand heavy fees for such transactions, and probably use these fees to grease said banking relationship.

I'm sure someone in their company is thinking about at least this chance to play on users' wishes for revolting against the old banking system. UK banks had to pay back a lot of excessive fees to their users; a long term HSBC customer paid a vacation from the reimbursement. Revolut must have been started soon after that happened.

THIS. Tech follows meatspace is generally a nicer option than meatspace having to adjust to tech.

"too little, too late"? Hi there, Roger!
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:30:55
Sorry, I probably should've been more clear :). I wanted to, in a evil-grin kind of way, notify you to the likelyhood, that AltF had had enough of argue-rife long comments and tried to short-circuit you. It might have worked, if I didn't poke my nose in it. Have a nice day, either way.

Bitwa.la probably has the best backing and support team. Xapo is near. But if you're not in a hurry and rather get better exchange rates, then SpectroCoin seems a safer gamble than Uquid with its weird language and backing.

lending out? for swaps? where?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:00:08
Well. The miners are, in general, buying their mining hardware from Jihan, and Jihan can ("oops") happen to delay delivery for already paid for hardware to those who oppose his pet peeves. So AB already smells like rotten herrings.

And Trump, and this is the truth, sure won't give 'em any. They're fine people, the best people, so they can ofc manage current and future important cases with 10% or maybe even 25% less funding.

The NY agreement guys are more suits than devs. Suits can take decisions before knowing if what they decide is doable. And they can *change their minds* later, when reality hits them on the head.

You can send btc and ltc to nonexistant addresses, which compares well to burning money. There is some checking for spelling mistakes and swapped characters so you need a tool to create a perfect "burn address".
There is never the case in bitcoin or litecoin that something has to exist. You can make up an address that "does not exist" in so far as nobody will ever be able to touch any coins you send there. Long read:
