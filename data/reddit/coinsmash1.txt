These exchanges take great risks to maintain global liquidity for Bitcoin as a global asset class. 
If they win or lose (in accumulating BTC) in my opinion they paid there dues in facilitating the primary speculative value that Bitcoin has today in relation to its relatively small market cap (in relation to other global asset classes)

I am aware of atomic swaps, but what we have taking place here is a “layer 3” transaction/protocol/swap?
I think the layer is more about the transition and interaction between layers with different levels of custody and risk.

Having and running a full node is a true sign of commitment to self sovereignty 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:27:48
The network has to start from somewhere, we now have 12,000 funded channels with over a million dollars worth of capacity. I still remember the debates when this idea was in a white paper stage (and no one had worked out how to do lightning addresses)
We now have real stores with products and an array of apps and implementations

My understanding is that if you connect a channel to your own node then it is only possible to swipe funds if you have the private key from the node set up. I may be wrong however..

I really don’t think I agree...the back end functionality is missing for now but the user experience is pretty intuitive (to anyone who has made prior crypto transactions) 
The most significant difference is the requirement to create an invoice (with an amount) before you can revive funds into the wallet.

A celebration that happens each year on the anniversary of the genesis block (first BTC block)
Participants show ownership over their own private keys, by pulling there funds from
Exchanges or other custodial partners (or even just doing a transaction to show that they do actually have access to there keys)
You just can’t do this with ‘traditional’ assets like shares or bonds (who your broker has a claim on)..crypto should celebrate this every year with proof of keys

I can’t sorry, I wonder if in the future people will chose to connect there node to other people they trust (in there personal network)
My understanding that most nodes have an auto feature to connect to a variety of central nodes. I have ordered a casa node and it should be arriving soon.
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:04:32
It is a custodial wallet if you connect to the  Blue wallet LNDHub node (default setting)
But if you connect it to your own node (and set up channels to that) then as long as you have control over the nodes private keys (or trust the owner) then I assume it’s pretty safe to use. 
If I am mistaken I am happy to be corrected on this (or learn about how it really works) 
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:25:27

I judge him on his contributions (Top 10 for all time Github comits) and his ideas. 
I personally agree with his ideas on being better to decrease then ever increase block size. 
However, more than that I don’t want to see any more hard forks. 
In that case, implementation becomes key to forming consensus for the idea. 
My prime path for scaling would be layer two solutions (pegged into BTC chain)
