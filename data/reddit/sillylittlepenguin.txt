It's time for everyone to get whatever they can out of Bitfinex before this blows up.

There could be protocol upgrades that we'll be able to implement that make solo-mining more profitable. 
Right now, we would never get those upgrades, because the mining cartel will just block it. 
There is a lot of ideas that right now would never see the light of day, because any developer that wants to upgrade some mechanic, will know that the miners won't like it and reject it, even if it's good for Bitcoin and the network as a whole.
So he doesn't program it in the first place.

Agree 100%.
The price of Bitcoin should not be wildly changing based on the Tweets of a select few miners and 'influential' morons. That's no different than Wall St. hanging on by a thread on every word spewed by the Fed Chairwoman/Man.
We'll get the predictable "Bitcoin is dead" media circus, the news about Bitcoin mining companies shutting down and liquidating, while the real Bitcoin proponents scoop up a unit or two and continue mining because they subscribe to the idea of Bitcoin, and they are not in it to "get rich quick".

2013, $1100. "Bitcoin will never be under $1000 ever again".
Don't worry though, I am bullish long term. We'll rise again to these levels with a much faster, much more scalable Bitcoin.
So even if you buy now anyway and hold, you'll come out ahead eventually.

Nope. No alts.
Alts will implode.

The price will fall way below that, that's the problem. The math just isn't going to work for a long time.
But it will make us very, very decentralized. We will also see a significant increase in Bitcoin nodes as most entities will be mining with the liquidated miners.
There's a lot of R&amp;D needed to increase the efficiency and, it's just not going to happen during this phase of Bitcoins life.

Bitcoin won't die, project will continue and rise again.

The scaling fight between Core, BU, Barrys 'Agreement' with now even some of the signers already backing out of it... is going to reach a fever pitch.
But there can be multiple reasons.
