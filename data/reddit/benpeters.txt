Looks like Gox is in full meltdown. The crash in price I presume reflects an inability for people to withdraw BTC.

I sympathize with you guys, but you have to be careful what you do next - and you have to communicate properly about the problems and proposed solutions!

It's one of two reasons IMHO:
1. Gox has fixed their USD withdrawal 'issues', causing the exchange to rebalance (people don't need to buy BTC to get their money out).
2. People now can't withdraw BTC, so they've stopped buying BTC. Lower demand = lower price.
I suspect the problem is  since  wouldn't have such a dramatic/fast effect.
Could be the beginning of the end.

I've had payments from people, with product not delivered. I delivered by hand, assuming that the funds would at some point be forwarded-on to me from the temporary Blockchain address, but then....
I just got this from their support:
We are still fixing a few issues with the API. The funds are not lost. They will either get to the destination or be returned. Please wait for a bit. Sorry about the inconvenience.

'RETURNED'. Christ.... what a fuck up.

Fiat currencies are backed by debt.

I would say this is pretty cynical. The prizes are paltry.
It would be better if they committed to a sum of X (where X is non-paltry) as compensation for any idea they subsequently utilized.
