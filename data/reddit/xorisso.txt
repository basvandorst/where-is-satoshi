Scam, there are a lot of scammers that registered the same username from reputable localbitcoins traders and use it to scam people like you.
Pawn some shit, get new friends and your shit together.

This means 80% adoption if I understood you correctly.

We've been doing great so far buying FIAT "directly" for a long time.
Get over it, there won't be mass adoption of main chain balances simply because most of us don't store wealth in gold bars under our beds. Main chain will be used for reserves and significant wealth and property transfer. Banks will be banks and we will pay for their services - channels - as we always had because most of us can't trust ourselves with the responsibility of literally holding our own wealth.
Difference is that we know the size of each channel of each bank, their significant transfers of wealth and the size of its reserves at all times. 
No wonder they hate the idea.

Really? You link me church material? That's a new one - Newton Hating Nazis. Made my day!
I won't spend any more energy with you.

That is part of the joke

Feel free to debate and denial anything else you want in life, just not Newton.
Doing so, you are either trolling, mentally handicapped or a complete ignorant.

Yet he invented what engineering calls calculus. In his early twenties. 
Educate yourself:
The Principia is considered one of the most important works in the history of science.
If it weren't for Newton, you wouldn't probably be alive and using the internet to mock his ass. 
Show some respect and stop spreading bullshit. Thank you.

Another difference is the cost of storage and accounting (gold reserves, not granny's rings and chains). The amount of resources spent doing it with gold are probably even higher than the resources spent on the whole Bitcoin's network, mining included.
Either way, we keep comparing apples with oranges. The sooner we stop doing it, the sooner people will realize that Bitcoin is not digital gold but something different - IMHO better.
