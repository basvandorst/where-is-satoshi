I'm happy it doesn't back the USD any longer. Currency needs to hold stable value. That's why we have inflation targets and monetary policy. Bitcoin is a step backwards for global finance as a currency. It's essentially a libertarian utopia

Thanks a cursory google search shows some similar arguments. I'd like to avoid confirmation bias and despite my reddit name I don't want to sound contrarian for the sake of being negative. I spent most of my studies and professional life trying to avoid pitfalls of past economic policy. I guess you can say I'm a "statist" and wholeheartedly support the role of a federal government and federal reserve to support stable commerce. Is the US government perfect? Absolutely not. But turning to a currency that could lead to some of the prior frenzied selloffa and deflationary spirals we've seen before is not the answer.

Limited supply. First movers make money when newcomers join. High incentive to push new people into bitcoin. Tell me, if you heard an analyst tell you to buy a stock, then find out he was heavily invested in that stock, would you trust him out right?

If you like bitcoin because you don't lik3 banks, that's one thing. However, many of the institutions that could be constructed around bitcoin will be very much a bank. Want to keep your bitcoin safe, insured, and earn a small return? I see a bank, whether an existing one or a new one, stepping in to provide that service. Not everyone is savvy enough to hold their own wallet and if this really were to go mainstream it's gonna probably feel a lot like a bank app.

Deflation is no better.

Did I say it wouldn't catch On? I said your vision of bitcoin may be more corporatist than you currently envision. And yes, DL and blockchain have great things in store for us, but aren't we talking about bitcoin here? And don't tell me what to say. I'm calling it like I see it. Sorry if we disagree. It sometimes that's what happens on reddit.

The reason bankers call it a pyramid scheme is because it is. Everyone who owns bitcoin is trying to sell you on bitcoin. They want you to buy it, making the price go up and themselves richer.  Pyramid scheme or multilevel marketing, take your pick
