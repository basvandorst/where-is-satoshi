Hi Im the creator of CryptoPackage and Im posting this here to get your guys' feedback and see what you think about the service. I am a freedom loving human who values privacy and liberty, and I created this service for people who want to keep their privacy safe while making crypto-purchases.
CryptoPackage.com has been live for several months now and has processed many successful purchases. If there is an item you would like to be listed on the website, please let me know.
Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated, thank you

The private shipping information is PGP encrypted and is only decrypted on a secure computer at the time of shipping. Your shipping info gets deleted as soon as the order is shipped out, and the info never touches an external or insecure server. 
How would you recommend making an private service like this more anonymous?

Awesome! Please leave any feedback you may have. Also, if you want a certain item listed from another website, let me know and ill get that item listed for you.

Thanks for the response. Decryption of the shipping info is only done once on a secure computer when processing and shipping the order. Its anonymous in the sense that the purchase through the website cannot be tied to the shipment to your house. Do you see any way to make this more anonymous?

100% legit. We are a privately owned business with no investment funding from anyone, so we are only beholden to our customers. Our only goal is to provide a secure and anonymous way to exchange your bitcoins for physical goods shipped directly to you. We have already fulfilled several orders and are prepared to process many more!
