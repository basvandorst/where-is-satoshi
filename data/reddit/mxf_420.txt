actual exchanges? what's the definition of an "actual exchange"? and where does this shelf concept keep coming from? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:41
Such as?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:55:01
How? An exchange going down doesn’t mean bitcoin is “sold out”
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:50:13
jeez bro, click the links and see for yourself that they are all exchanges ~~before you make yourself look ignorant. it might be too late though.~~
edit: sry for being mean 
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:16:39
Decentralization is the word you’re looking for. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:44:34
An exchange is not a store with bitcoin sitting on the shelf. It simply connects buyers and sellers. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:26
I’ve never heard of bitcoin being sold out.

Judging by the fact he was successfully able to pull this off the movie is his nephews film school thesis. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:39:38
so because blockchain is useful it means bitcoin isn't a bubble? i'm not sure i follow. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:18:01
As well as the fact 5m is the media buy only ie the timeslot the commercial would play. What about the actual production? a shitty commercial cuz u can’t pay a writer, director, dp, editor, producer, and crew would be embarrassing and not helpful. 
not to mention that I️ don’t think it would be helpful to begin with, and only perpetuates the hype inherent with bubbles. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:24:53
Ha, no worries! I figured. at first I thought you meant you were “making a killing” which would’ve been a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:38:35
GDAX and yes
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:30:42
Ahahaha that’s rich! Anyone who is willing to work for “exposure” is an amateur. I️ work in the biz and I’ve never once been able to pay my rent with exposure.

*looks at username*
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:31:40
Now we’re talking!
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:20:57
So you’re taking a beating? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:32:54
along with everyone else
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:46:00
Donating your time for an honorable cause is one thing, but considering bitcoin I’d argue that would be slightly delusional. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:53:41
now if only others could admit the same 
@_date: 2018-07-30 03:54:48
i don't want anything or care about the level of adoption in either direction. i was just asking a question because i don't think kardashian fans are going to be the reason that bitcoin is fully adopted within society and if it is, then wow.
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:42:59
Why does bitcoin need uneducated Kardashian fans to buy? So that when they panic sell you can buy low, or....?
Look at the publicity from last year and how that turned out. Why do you think this is any different? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:34:13
what a compellingly articulate assessment 
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:40:16
Go to Kim’s story (if you can stomach it, I can understand if you couldn’t)and you’ll see that she’s the one who posted it originally. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:34:44
cool story bro 
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:43:59
So wait, how is this gonna be any different from last fall when Bitcoin was getting tons of media coverage? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:35:06
But first lemme get this sweet sweet karma
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:44:29
I just watched her story and I saw it very clearly posted so I am confused why you’re laughing so heartily. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 03:52:26
lol ooops, looks like i just got rekt heh 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:29:52
Either way I’m enjoying this. Don’t stop. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:32:18
Alien bitcoin baby is the name of my band actually 
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:25:38
Bitcoin is far from the ultimate privacy. The blockchain makes it incredibly easy to track down individual transactions
