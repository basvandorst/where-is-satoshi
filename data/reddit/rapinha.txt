Thats me buying for USD 12,070 thinking it was cheap...
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:14:39

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:50:01

@_date: 2017-12-22 22:43:52
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:37:37
I really hope so!
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:26:37
i expect the exact same thing
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:36
going down
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:26
Its a great one indeed! Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:10
many thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:51
what a financial orgasm!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:51:03
but we had a turnaround yesterday, right? Almost 20% dip!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:50:17
Hmm Im considering Ethereum and IOTA for the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:03:44
GO GO GO GO GO 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:54

Nice post! Really well written. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:28
After the first loss, never again.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:46:51
I know this feeling, but I think back in the day it didnt make sense to put money on this. At least for me, who was never a tech guy. The lesson I get from this is to always be more curious on innovation technologies...
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:07:01
man, I am seriously aprehensive of a huge drop in value...but I MUST HODL! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:43:07
thats my fear, specially with the CME futures launch next week. I think there will be a dip in the weekend, just like happened in the last one, but Im afraid I will end up losing
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:57:46
Yeah I noticed, after the bullish period, it seems that a lot of people just vanished.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:21:17
that is a great strategy. I think I will adopt it! I ve made 50% profit already. Thanks man! I guess the FOMO is hitting me really hard
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:02:12
TO THE MOOOOOOOOON
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:58
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:42:51
I just cannot stop looking at the price of bitcoin and how much times left till the futures go live....UURRGHH
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:57:13
Lol 
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:38:03
Hmm I am a bit concerned about this map. In Brazil, the crypto market seems to be in a very, very gray area. So it is hard to say that the bitcoin is 100% legal, is more like lacking a proper regulation in my opinion 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:52:34
hmm I didnt get the time to read about it just yet. But IOTA seems to  have some really cool partnerships as well! Microsoft, Schneider Electric...
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:34:07
Thats exactly it. I dont understand why people is arguing that bitcoin cant sponsor etc etc. I know its based on the blockchain, but Im just trying to spread the word
Edit: typo
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:52:35
exactly what happened to me. I had made a huge profit two days ago, lost everything and now im trying to revert the situation, lets hope it grows!
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:56:15
thanks for you words, my friend. Unfortunately I lost the profit I've made two days ago? hopefully the scenario is going to be better
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:52:35
I will take a look at it. Thank you very much for the assistance! 
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:09:12
Im not exactly sure how to do it. Do you know where I can find a good tutorial?
