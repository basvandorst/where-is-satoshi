And why would I be a spammer? The exchange is called "Crypto Rush" and their slogan is "Crypto To Crypto Exchange". You are a sourpuss tbh :)

I know, not saying it isn't, just a general warning :)
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:52:54
Afraid not no :)

Oh I'm expecting a ton of downvotes, but that isn't really bothering me.
As long as people take their time to read it, my mission has been accomplished ;)
Would love to hear some reasoning from the downvoters though, man up &amp; speak your mind, come on :)

thank you for keeping this list up-to-date :)
2014 seems to be a breakout year for Bitcoin conferences. Woohoo!

It's a first edition, don't get your hopes up too high :)

glad to see their network hashrate percentage is dropping :)

I've been using CEX.IO for a while now and have never had any issues with them.
The fact they keep innovating does mean they're here to stay, and I'm glad they're "going with flow".
Definitely interesting :)

If only you knew what we had in store for issue 
You might get exactly what you asked for ;)
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:07:13
it might not be noteworthy to you, but there are a lot mroe involved with Bitcoin than just you I'm afraid.
"The article is trying to make it sound like the price completely plummeted or something."  It was on the brink of plummeting completely because people wouldn't get their head out of their rears :)
I know Bitcoin is down 50%, but it also went up 50% in 36 hours, you have to look at the glass half full, not half empty
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:58:11
bitcoin's price is all about perception at this point, so it did "recover to 600$".
People who can't see the truth in that shouldn't even be involved with cryptocurrency in general.
Besides, Bitstamp went as low as 400$ not even 36 hours ago, so....you tell me.
@_date: 2014-01-08 10:52:35
I did mention that a rumor is enough to create a small hype leading to a Bitcoin price increase :) but it doesn't explain a near 40% jump in value ;)
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:19:28
apparently you are the only one :)
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:06:55
Not surprised they ask this to be honest, it's becoming the norm for most exchanges from what I can see. Annoying, definitely :) but with all companies trying to be "compliant", this was to be expected I guess...
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:48:50
I'm sure Netflix loves the extra attention they could get with this :)
@_date: 2014-08-12 08:55:03
We just put it into a nice article about BTC China here : 
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:04:00
largest of the world if you read the article properly :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:45:12
Yes, we are. Details will be added after Bitcoin Expo 2015.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:55:42
more stuff added, if you have any requests for games, let me know :)
