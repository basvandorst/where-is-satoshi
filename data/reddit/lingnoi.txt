This has always been the case and it's obvious why.
Pretend to be paypal and your a buyer or seller that could be lying. How can they prove that you were sent the digital thing? It's impossible for paypal to get evidence on without spending a huge amount of time on each case and they have thousands of cases a day.
Instead they tell you up front right in their terms. It's a pretty easy question to ask yourself. "If I need to talk to paypal about this can I prove without a huge amount of time and effort being spent that I am correct?".
If the answer is no then don't use them because if you do need to contact them then they're not going to have patience for time wasters who don't read their terms.

How is this bitcoin related?
Also since the topic has be brought up why is this any worse then getting a warrant to search someone's house? Just because something is digital doesn't mean laws go out the window.

Where do they say this?
You own quote from them says it's not..


[It even says this on the main page of their website]( right at the bottom of the page.


This page was three pages into the site, it's not buried in the depths where you'll never find it.
It also says this in other places such as their terms of service, and so on; it has said this for many years now.

With regards to the gift card, you're buying the piece of plastic. Pay Pal won't do anything if the code has already been used.

Majority of people... none of which live in thailand.. awesome vote there. Also what is this about "old currency type" are you saying that you think Baht will not be used soon? If so you're wrong.
I don't really see why a community made up mostly of americans and europeans gets a vote anyway I bet if the vote was for $ or £ they'd be a lot more negative votes saying it's confusing.

Just because other countries screw it up doesn't necessitate a repeat of the same mistake.
Frankly this is just confusing even though you don't think so because you're not trying to convert from ฿ to ฿. I'm not talking about completely changing how bitcoin works, just stop stealing other countries currency symbols.

yes, I live in thailand and use the baht every day.
