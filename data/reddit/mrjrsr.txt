It's losing its competitive edge as a currency (except, i guess, where anonymity is important).    
Bitcoin is becoming a commodity. I'm not psyched

As a pragmatic cryptoanarchistic I recognize that without use and adoption a currency isn't

nearly everyone in the us has a bank account, or can get one, or an account at a credit union, so this is very relevant for 0.3billion of the most privileged people on earth

transaction volume means amount of btc not number of transactions. satoshidice and the like are dust in terms of volume

It's not fabulous for me personally- I won't use it. But it's probably pretty compelling for the average user in the US...    
    
For bitcoin to be competitive it has to actually *compete*. Google's gloves are off, and they have enormous resources. (who needs p2p if you own all of the p's)    
    
Bitcoin needs innovation

no worries

Nah. Before today, I'd tear you a new one. Here's the article that changed my behaviour:     
**Data Mining Reveals How The “Down-Vote” Leads To A Vicious Circle Of Negative Feedback**    
    
    
here's TL:DR     
is it strong or weak to try and change for the better?

Wow, you're actually much more pessimistic than I am :). I think cryptocurrency will succeed in the next decade or burn out completely, and I think the trend will be obvious in the next few years...    
It's easy to throw around statistics about webwallets. The momentary FACT is that bitcoin transaction volume has PLUMMETED. That may mean that all of the transactions are off-blockchain, meaning on exchanges, but that isn't a good thing. Or, it may mean that everyone is treating bitcoin like a commodity and not a currency.    
I think the problem is that people see bitcoin as a commodity that will gain value rather than an everyday spendable currency.    
    
EDIT: also, I recently read an article on reddit about negative comment feedback and its rippling effect on a community. Ordinarily I would have responded to your rude comment with aggression. I'm trying to be a friendlier commenter

sorry dude. Old me would have lashed out. New me won't.    
Please consider that sexist comments aren't helpful. Humanity encompasses all genders equally.    
As a man, I think we would be way better off with a feminized society, even though i don't know exactly what that means... I'm guessing less war more kindness, right?

It's a risk like any other. Don't risk more than you can afford to lose.    
Honestly, the fact you are asking HERE means that you haven't researched enough to be investing. (asking isn't research).    
    
Learn more and decide for your self. If you are "broke", you shouldn't be gambling on risky investments imho
