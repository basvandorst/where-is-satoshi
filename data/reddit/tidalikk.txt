maybe try to use a good exchange like gemini or coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:22:13
not everyone can afford to pay 100$ per transaction bro
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:17:29
so basically in reality bitcoin market cap is much lower since 4 milion bitcoins aren't even circulating, so the true bitcoin market cap is 188 bilions if that's true + im counting satoshi coins, if we dont count satoshis coins bitcoin isnt even top 1 on coinmarket cap lol
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:12:58
you can still chargeback using friends and family quite easely, just not as easely, dont ever use paypal to take big payments from unkown people where the transaction can't easely be proven

with 1000 bitcoins you are not tiny fish, that's definitely a whale 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:12:33
just shows your ignorance x)
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:57:17
depends on the coins, if the total supply is the same as the circulating coins it gives a good idea on how much that coin is worth, the problem is on coins with unkown supply ( bitcoin since no one really knows how many bitcoins are circulating) and coins where the supply is controlled by the developers 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:13:32
Funny how thats the only thing bitcoin as to offer, shitcoin forks to pump the price 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:49
why :o?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:23:32
while it was funny its really imature and honestely just makes this sub image even worse
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:58:14
just leting you know that's not how fee works, you can't just multiply it...
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:33:30
and i would have said the exact same thing to them, but it didn't happen
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:06:33
It can be hacked, it can happen so much, from what I’ve seen you had already made your mind when posting this , if u want to go all in go for it , but don’t come here shilling how it’s better then playing it safe 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:31:30
what, not even close bro, if anything Mt. Gox 2.0 will be due to tether printing
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:12:29
ah ok my bad :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:09:40
And what is the “truth”?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:24:29
well it isn't January O.o
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:58:31
Have any of you actually read the article, its pure assumptions, considering this evidence is non sense, but they  have to get the most sensationalist title for them clicks i guess
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:19
By fishy you mean discussing btc current problems? i would love to have some actual content on this sub beside memes, and some people (and a small minority from the looks of it) are interested to see and discuss with other people about this problems, if you want to continue your circle jerk of memes go ahead but don call people worried about bitcoin the "fishy" ones
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:00:45
1-"In case you missed the latest flub with ETH &gt; 
that wasn't even eth fault, if you actually knew what happened you would know that 
2-its true eth is more centralized then btc but by no mean its centralized
3-"Doesn't work" im not even sure what to argue against such a baseless argument
4- "Fundamentally not sound" again just pure fud not giving sources 
tbh its not even worth to keep answering its obvius you just hate eth without knowing much of it 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:05:37
Have to diagree on the small fee part, its way to high 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:14:54
so let me get this straight, because you had a background in computer science, that makes your argument for eth being a scam coin legit? dont make me laugh, trying to show off with such a basic degree that anyone can do given time , and if to you that's all it needs to be a scam coin you're even more pathetic then i tough, bitcoin has is pros and cons , eth has is pros and cons none of them are scam coins , bitcoin has huge fees does that make it a scam coin? ofc not its a con that it has, just like eth has some, now grow up and try to inform yourself
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:31:46
i recommend watching this video if you're having troubles understanding it 
a bit outdated but didn't find better, should do the trick
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:19:03
but i just did o.o , i agreed with you, its an eth flaw, it's not perfect , doesnt make it a scam coin lol ( which was what you were saying and defending with that argument)
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:31:28
if you're looking to get neutral advices try to go to neutral places to discuss, this is a bitcoin sub reddit so obviusly people are biased, not saying they are wrong but its always nice to hear different opinions beside "eth is a scam coin" have a good day :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:48:53
treats people like shit, expects them to be  nice, ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ , grow up dude you really seem pathetic
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:33:53
never tough i would see rocket league being mentioned on this sub :o
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:29:46
best of luck my dude :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:29:34
what makes you think eth is a scam coin? probably one of the most interesting coins in the market
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:04:57
wait segwit2x isnt happening? can you ELI5 me on that?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:24:23
this was really disgusting, as a neutral guy who doesn't really care about bitcoin this was one of the most childish things i've ever seen, grow up
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:18:15
wtf is wrong with you O.o , you just look jealous because you're making no money
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:40:02
Why would that happen?
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:10:04
Eth is 50x :p 
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:35:47
Couldn’t have said it better.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:09:18
are you actually serious? btc fees are a hoax? have you actually been around for more then 2 months? December fees were completely outrageous hitting levels of 30$ per transaction, does this look like a hoax to you? the only reason fees are low now is because no one is using bitcoin , you can compare how the usage of bitcoin has been dropping drastically since December explaining the drop in fees. has long as  bitcoin won't solve it's scaling problems it will never go  mainstream. I believe in bitcoin future but denying it's problems is really delusional so try to grow some critical thinking instead of being purely biased  by what you're invested in
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:28:40
well tbh it was to easy, your arguments of "bitcoin fees are a hoax" was so weak that i didn't even need to try, have a good day
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:54:24
I actually think you are a bitcoin cash supporter from what I’ve seen from your post history trying to bring a bad image to bitcoin supporters, no one can be that retarded 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:15:05
so let me get this straight, a 20$ transaction is completely fine since you have loads of bitcoins and it doesn't affect you. Yep bitcoin is definitely going mainstream thanks to that extremely smart thinking, you solved it, there's no need for scaling solutions why not just keep increasing the fee price, how did we not tough of that?   I'm actually really disappointed that there are people involved in the amazing bitcoin projects like you who bring just an awful image to the bitcoin community 
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:21:23
he isn't saying just eth he is talking about any crypto currency, if a serious exploit was found for example on bitcoin in which the exploiter  could generate infinite bitcoins bitcoins price would drop to near 0, he is just advising people to not over invest in crypto due to it being a high risk investment , it's actually a smart thing to  do
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:04:26
and that's why scaling is so necessary, back in December the amount of people using bitcoin was still really low if you compare it to going mainstream, the moment average joes see they need to pay 20$ for 1 transactions they will never look back into it, otherwise we will never see real usage on the world and bitcoin will never actually be mainstream, just a high volatility market.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:23:53
what, you think i don't know that? that's why scaling solutions comes into play, to fix the exact problem that bitcoin currently has with scaling. you simply said that bitcoin fees were a hoax which they are not they are definitely real, and that's what Lightning is trying to help out with, we the bitcoin community shouldn't turn a blind on it saying thing like "it's a store of value fees don't matter" or "the fees are hoax" we should embrace this flaws and has a community try our best to solve them. Saying that since you have a ton of money fees aren't a problem is the wrong mentality since we want bitcoin to be used worldwide and by everybody. If we ever want to go mainstream we need to address this issue. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:03:35
 never seen someone spin someone comment so hard. No he is not saying that ethereum has a value of 0 just that there's always the risk that can happen to any crypto , and no he isn't talking about just ethereum he is talking about every single cryptocurrency jesus can't you read?
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:18:34
all trash talk no arguments , ive seen enough , have a good night
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:11:23


which is?  maybe the problem is trying to argue with people who have no critical thinking so maybe i should follow you're advice and stop trying to argue with a no brainer like you
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:20:19
What a retard comparison, birth control pills? Wtf
