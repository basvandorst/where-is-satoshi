From Jordan's plea email...


Boo fucking hoo, Jordan!
It's quite obvious from your sociopathic treatment of the MetaLab team over the past 10 months that you have absolutely no heart at all to be shattered.
Are you such a "young businessman" that you have never heard of the [Streisand Effect?](
EDIT: I a word.

I am not afraid to say I always deposit less than $10,000 at a time.
I don't think it's because I'm shady. I just think it's because I have never owned more than $10,000 at a time.
Come at me, IRS! :P

There are people who give their life savings away to Nigerian princes every single day, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were still some people dead set on purchasing a BFL Monarch.

Why is "bring paypal back" anywhere on alibaba.com? Did they just recently remove it or something?
I have ordered via Alibaba.com and (reluctantly) paid via paypal for items within the last few months. In fact, almost every supplier I contacted was asking me to pay via PayPal.

Tbh I don't see much spamming going on, most everybody who was tipped has accepted and appreciated the tips.
It's only the $0.38 tip that one of their commenters scoffed at.
Never look a gifthorse in the mouth is what I was always told.

There is absolutely nothing slanderous at all in either of the two ROBOgate posts.
[Defamation is "the communication of a **false statement** that harms the reputation of an individual, business, product, group, government, religion, or nation".](
Absolutely nothing that they have said is false.

It's curious that a corporation like newsweek.com did not own newsweeklied.com

Great point. 
The RV may as well not be insured at all because when the insurance companies discover it was vandalized because you've been using it as a public homeless shelter and/or soup kitchen and not your retirement RV that you only take out on sundays... the insurance company will laugh in your face at any claim you try to make on it.
God help you if they ever crashed it on the way to re-stock food or something... without proper insurance Jason King would be forced to foot the bill of probably hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. He'd be ruined.

No he did not.
He wrote a sentence, which was "Don't you realize his post is just sarcasm ?"

True, but if it's sole purpose is that of charitable work, then it must be insured as such.
It's no longer a personal vehicle if it's only used for charitable work.

Why do you think they're charging $2,000 per BTC?
That's because probably 9 out of every 10 sales are charged back.
**Do not try to sell digital currency with a chargeback-able payment medium in a public forum. It's just insane.**
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:26:00
What OS are you using?
Is it fully up to date security wise?
Has anyone ever had access to your computer besides yourself?
These are the sorts of questions you need to ask when your private keys are compromised (which yours have obviously been).

I first balked at the "site maintenance will take weeks".
Any competant online business does "site maintenance" on a private test server and seemlessly uploads it publicly once it's 100% ready to go without the user noticing any downtime.

They're open sourced, and they're cheaper because they have significantly less girth is what I have been told.
They're not the same as a robocoin, you couldn't just leave it unattended in a bar for example. Someone could just pick it up and walk away.

It's only a charity used vehicle as stated by Jason King, the only reason it is insured under his name is to safe money. Those are his own words.
It was gifted to sean's outpost as a charitable donation, not for Mr King to go on vacations with.

The article points to auctioning off tickets to the highest bidder by default as their "solution" to putting ticket scalpers out of business (as if ticket scalpers are somehow a bad thing?).
a) the powers that be can ([and already have occasionally but were legally reprimanded for it]( auction off the best tickets to the highest bidder right from the start, most of them simply choose not to.
b) every single person who owns bitcoin and is hoping they increase in value is no better than a ticket scalper (if you consider ticket scalpers to be bad people that is, I do not). We all bought tickets (bitcoins) hopefully at a lower price than we're going to sell them for. We hope that the concert (the bitcoin ecosystem) is going to sell out completely with people vying just to get a glimpse of mick jagger's sweaty sack (0.00001 BTC).
As for helping small independant shows sell their own tickets, sure, that's a great initiative. Alot of small independant venues have been doing that for years. It's called "tickets available at the door" and is used by most night clubs for small bands.
The reason this never happens for large shows isn't because Bitcoin wasn't invented yet, it's because ticketmaster has such a massive reach in terms of being able to secure ticket sales that the fees they charge are negligible to the concert organizers. (Especially when they're selling $200+ tickets).
**tl;dr I think this article is spending way too much time finding a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.**
Ticket scalpers who abuse the system by buying more than the allowed amount of tickets are charged with crimes in most jurisdictions.
If you want to get tickets to your favorite show, you had best be interested in that show from the day it is announced and buy your tickets early. Lest you get "screwed" by the ticket scalpers who demand a fee for their hard work and risky investment practices.

You should notify the secret service and provide your security video and any other information if you have it.
That's like one of their only jobs, and they do it pretty well from what I hear.
