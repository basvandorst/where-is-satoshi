Keiser is betting based on McAfee's prediction. At least he's not implicating his penis.

The internet has been designated as a human right by the UN. If you don't have electricity, complaining that bitcoin isn't going to solve all the world's problems doesn't help anything 
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:46:21
That's a false equivalancy. If I owe a million dollars, I owe a million dollars. If I reduce the purchasing power of that million, I can pay it off easier. That only works one time before you currency has lost its value so good luck with future debt.

PayPal is a third party payments processor, bitcoin is a trustless payments method. They can easily add bitcoin to their systems and continue on so that transactions support cashback

In that case forming questions obviously isn't your area of expertise.
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:34:49
Yeah but where?
@_date: 2019-02-17 12:31:14
It's still far better than holding fiat or gambling on the stock market.

Sorry bitch but the internet is a meritocracy.

It can help by removing the power of the government to fund the army by printing more money
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:56:16
Is that a question?

Seems like an error more than an actual amount. 
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:31:29
You're assuming that was all of his bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:05:55
Excellent question! You have the remote chance of coming across a whale who might sent you 10 BTC for kicks but also the plausible deniability that you were just being inquisitive!
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:06:41
Let this be a word of warning to all BTC holders. Bitches get crazy when they know money is involved. Keep your mouth fucking shut about all your crypto holdings or else you'll learn a very expensive lesson.

Good luck trying to find a mortgage with 0 interest.

In previous years I think nothing would happen but recently I think bitcoin would get a mild bump. I don't think the ultra wealthy would get on board during capital flight if they haven't already but I'm willing to be surprised.

They have to be seen to be doing something and this buys them some time. This is the most creative those economists can ever be in the context of their usual policy which is: 1. Print more money or 2. Don't print more money. When you see policy like this it's time to get scared.

Idiots have been saying this since BTC was worth 50 dollars each.

Tell that to the Venezuelans that are pushing over 2000 BTC through local bitcoins per week
@_date: 2019-01-16 06:30:41
It doesn't matter. Crypto is working to solve a problem for these people.
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:48:25
Yeah, I'm sure that will go down well. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:50:16
What the utter fuck are you wasting words on? The more countries that get involved the more chance that people will stop starving to death. Do and do yourself a favour and stop commenting, the entire world will thank you for it.

There was a 51% attack on Ethereum classic in the past few hours, this will probably lead to a 24 hour selloff because the market is irrational.

They mentioned ETC in this report which is essentially a dead coin.
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:52:42
It's unusual but it actually makes sense. On youtube you can research a topic at the specific level of depth that's meaningful for you.
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:22:58
That's because the main exchanges have halted ECH and they haven't been updated since
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:34:26
Bullshit. No one with over a couple of hundred thousand is going to leave it in an exchange for a couple of months waiting to buy back. Even if they withdraw the cash, it's a taxible event anyway, stripping out massive profits. You're talking about a ten year span so what's equally possible as your conspiracy theory is that they've died already due to natural causes anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:04:02
None of that applies to Venezuela because it's currently a shithole, so what are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:00:12
I wouldnt have been able to sell my free bCash if no exchanges would accept it.
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:02:38
I'm not based in the US, I'm referring to the majority of taxation policy in every country.
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:53:16
I keep thinking this. What relevence does 21 million mean. Satoshi was a great visionary so why did he pick 21 million. Was it that the end game would be some something like you describe, the price being set to some relative dollar amount at a certain price to encourage uptake at a certain period. I guess we'll never know.
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:32:13
How about microtransactions, or 24/7 international remittance, or services for the billions of people in the third world who are underbanked, or the multiple other advantages that you're too lazy to research?

Because it's a dictatorship you fucking moron. Go and learn about the topic before commenting on it. There's international condemnation against maduro because he has brought the country to the point of starvation. So fuck you and you idiotic words, you've no idea what's going on while people are literally starving to death right as I type this.

It wasn't early days at all. It goes against everything crypto stands for. After that, I would never consider owning a single eth.

Nothing is stopping a notary creating a forgery of your will either, so since you'll be dead anyway, don't sweat it too much.

They can't get dollars in or out of the country, I'm guessing the majority of these transactions are remittances from family members working overseas and then the local people are converting to dollars for purchases on the black market that are not supported by bitcoin yet. Eventually they might be transferred to a faster coin like dash or something so purchases because the the country is so poor that the cost of living is very low, making the bitcoin transaction comparatively high for grocery transactions.
