Lol - they are not banning them, please read the UPDATED Reuters article...
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:55
This is a good article, thought provoking. Thank you for posting. 
Taking it all into account, I think that one flaw in the logic is that BTC is in-effect owned by a small number of people.  Let’s call them the “mega whales”.
Owning 10,000s BTC each. 
If they HODL then what the MoM strategy will do is flush out the “weak hands” who just bought BTC, or indeed bought at a few $1000 and get scared and lock in a modest profit for their small BTC holdings (vs the mega whales).
If the mega whales don’t sell then the MoM have a long term problem. Sure the price will fall short term due to weak hands selling, but I don’t personally believe the mega whales will use this as their “final out” moment.  Too much ideology. 
Also, if a bank did what you said, and it went wrong, then there would be hell to pay for those individuals who made the call to manipulate the market.  Sure the market is unregulated, but the futures market IS highly regulated. The Fed cannot do what you suggest either.  There is scrutiny on their balance sheet :)
I think your well written article is the doomsday scenario.
I don’t believe it’s a likely scenario.
Possible yes; probable no.
I have heard from a few traditional traders (who are used to managing billions of USD) that they think the volume on CBOE futures will be pretty much nothing.  CBOE also require 44pc “equity” so leverage is only 2:1.
More on CME for sure, as it is “the” futures marketmaker.  Their leverage is unknown at this point.  It will likely be more leveraged than CBOE tho. But won’t be anything like traditional assets like Oil/Gold where 20:1 is normal. 
However they still don’t think it will be much volume even on CME.
Shorting BTC has in the past been a super duper mega high risk thing to do.  One can lose one’s shorts (and underwear!) extremely quickly.
I guess we shall know by Christmas!
Thank you your post, I wish Reddit had more of this thought provoking discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:57:34
I hope if they asked you that you have some knowledge!
Don’t copy others, y’all from your experience and knowledge.
Good to watch some others talk for sure to give you ideas.  But only talk on what you believe in.
(Edit: I have done major TV interviews in the past where I had to explain tricky things  so I am talking with at least some experience)

What a pathetic article.  Of course the futures didn’t do anything crazy, why would they.
They author has zero idea how financial markets work.
100x more volume was traded OUTSIDE the futures, ie on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:50:48
Lol so you ask a random person on Reddit who you don’t know...

He's probably wishing "I wish that fucking redditor sunilross would not remind me about this..."
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:56:24
Correct, it's just some KYC/AML regulation, which frankly most people in most countries have to do anyway.
It's GOOD news.
Lol @ all the FUD on reddit...  And the conspiracy theories...  
But Reuters were sloppy in their original article being 2 paragraphs (and short ones) long, and then updating it 1 hour later AFTER the crypto markets had crashed with a far far far softer article.

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:25:45
The wealth of the world is roughly $250T if you google it.
Bitcoin is ROUGHLY 1000x less.
So for it to be $10m (1000x more than now) it would have to be equal to the wealth of the world.
I am long BTC, but that would be getting a bit out of whack.
Unless it literally replaced fiat entirely.  Which is possible.

How much is that tho?  Clearly they have a product which has some allocation to that fund.  
Still pretty funny considering what Dimon said!

@_date: 2017-09-18 15:06:20
So no exchanges have been affected at all right?  I mean we haven't just heard ALL crypto-fiat is shutting down...?  So not actually 'FAKE NEWS', actually 100% ACCURATE AND CORRECT NEWS...
It was easy to tell with some of the details that the FAKE/FUD brigade missed.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:57:27
Nope, was just sharing info.  Which is correct.  But w/e
Search my posts.  I consistently said the china fiat to crypto ban was real.  And everyone just said "FUD", "FAKE"...
I was trying to help a community.  But it's very clear the community is toxic.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:18:48
It would not be affected.  Different laws in HK.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:17:47
Of course BTCC is not stable :P, it's SHUTTING DOWN in 16 days.
The non-Chinese market is fairly stable.  My post is clear on that, as BTC price means the global BTC price.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:11:02
No thanks :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:29:10
Exactly.  At least you and I have a brain :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:03:40
I just went to btcchina the Chinese site and it's 21,000 RMB which is WHAT A SURPRISE $3,000.  Or the right price for china.  And NOT the non-china price.
Here is URL:
So, yeah, not how to burn oneself.
And also even you saw OKcoin was 2,900 too.
Honestly people are so lazy here, I do my own proper research and actually check things.
Be careful you are on the correct BTCC site, you need to go in via the CHINESE SITE. For the Chinese site :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:30:53
The client's asked them to buy it.  It's simple.  And normal.  And nothing to give a shit about. 
They ARE profiting from Bitcoin (they take commissions) which does go against Dimon.  He was a dick for FUDing...
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:06:41
Fake?  Really...?
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:57:17
So if the journalist is correct, will they be an amazing journalist all of a sudden?
It's not news ANY OF US want to hear, but it could be correct.  Just saying 'fake news' is a rather pathetic reaction.
You would want to be told about rumours of a nuclear war before the first nuke hits you I would think...  Then you can decide whether you move to New Zealand or stay in New York!
Everyone is making their own decisions here.  But having a reddit that just says anything bad is 'fake news' is really not helping. It's the  story on WSJ.com.  It doesn't get put there without at least SOME evidence behind it.
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:02:31
There is no official announcement yet, and there may never be.  Until there is, the exchanges will operate as normal I would think.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:35:10
Be careful here tho, as Trade volume does NOT equal price.
China has supply and demand, which should, in theory even out.  So if you take out an equal amount of supply and demand then there should be no change.
Also, today BTC has got the same price in China and outside China, theoretically there would be zero price drop if China bans fiat to crypto.
Although I suspect there would be a temporary one just due to some people panicking...
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:30:01
Yes.  They won't be priced negatively!
They should raise when historic low rates for the long run.  Makes sense if the market (mainly China) will buy them!
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:41:14
I just realised that no one has subscriptions to the WSJ.  However I do.
I have read the article.  I can't post it as that is against ToS.
But I can post some snippets:
*The country’s central bank has led a draft of instructions that would ban Chinese platforms from providing virtual currency trading services, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes after months of scrutiny by Beijing, including a ban last week in China on initial coin offerings, a kind of fundraising via virtual currencies.*
*Officials from the central bank, cyberspace administration and banking, securities and other regulatory bodies considered various options for months but ultimately came to a consensus to shut down virtual currency exchanges, said the people.*
* “Too much disorder was naturally a basic reason” for the ban, said one of the people." *
They spoke to insiders.  You can believe it or not.  Make up your own mind.

Lol at the projection, it might happen, but seriously, that is a professional MS Paint job :D.

That no one actually knows.
Pretty basic point...
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:49:12
Many more banks than those two did this.  Many many many more.
Morgan Stanley, BoA, Wells F, RBS, Deutsche Bank, Barclays etc etc.  Dozens did it.
Sure lots of smaller bank did not - totally agree.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:49:16
Of course they will be shutting down.
That is pretty obvious considering BTCC is...
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:35:11
No really, if it is legit please post publicly.
It's clearly a scam if you won't.
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:22:02
Apart from the fact it was 100pc correct...
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:16:34
You can leave them with your attorney if you want to as part of your will (which is securely held), although if someone got them you would be screwed.  And there are dodgy attorneys out there - however 99.99% are reputable and honest.  But they may have bad security for storage...
So you could split each key in half and leave with TWO separate attorneys, this hugely reduces the likelihood of foul play, and hugely reduces the chance someone steals from both.
Of course you could split each key in thirds, or quarters etc, with 3 or 4...  You get the idea.
If you have $M's then this is worth it.  
If you have $10k then it's not worth it.
Above is just an idea, i've never thought about the 'dodgy attorney' scenario!
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:57:24
Of course OKCoin is going to close.  The decision has been made by Government - it's 100% certain that other fiat-to-crypto exchanges will close.
It's not like they have a choice...
They will all shut 30th Sept, as they have been told to shut by that date, it's pretty obvious.
Now, they may then REOPEN with licenses given out by the Government, we shall see.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:05:33
A journalist would never reveal sources, same happens in the US...
"a source close to the White House".
There is no difference here.
The story may turn out to be true, or not true.  Time shall tell.
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:43:36
Haha :)
@_date: 2017-09-11 10:23:21
Same thing.
Yunbi is a Top 40 exchange globally, although it was heavily pushing ICOs, it is sub scale for fiat-crypto and crypto-crypto.
So if it's true (and it's hard to know as I can't read Chinese), it could be due to it just being sub scale in China for trading.
Not clear.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:35:27

@_date: 2017-09-16 11:51:00
I'm anyone can go to CMC and check the prices.  Yours are massively incorrect.
Go here noob:
And shut up.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:03:28
Yes a rare moment of good news for this week!
They have no fiat to crypto I assume?
It's all crypto to crypto?
This is great for Binance as they should be able to unban Chinese IPs no?
@_date: 2017-09-21 10:11:17
They can't ban all VPNs.  Unless they have a new tech no one else has built yet.  Which they might!
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:06:35
Agreed.  To be honest it was fairly sure with BTCC alone.
It's time to buy just after OKCoin and/or Huobi announce (I would be surprised if they didn't announce today China time), as there will be a dip, event though it SHOULD be already priced in, but BTC doesn't work like that :D
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:25:20
I doubt they will shut exchanges for good.  I suspect they will regulate them with licenses.  The large ones will remain, and the small ones will shut.  That would literally have zero impact on crypto in the long run as all the volume is in the large exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:20:24
I honestly don't care what you say :)
I know what I know. Take it or leave it.
In terms of the above, it is 100pc accurate.  But the issue with Reddit is that there is so much BS, and no GOOD reputation system, that you can't tell.
But whatever, I honestly don't care :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:04:58
This is finally NOT fake news.  I went to their website and it's right there.
Plus on their official twitter account.
Clearly the other exchanges will follow.  Then they will get regulated in some manner or licensed (this last sentence is me guessing)
BTC price pretty stable considering.  It was priced in mostly.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:30:47
It's a HYIP Ala Ponzi scheme AKA scam.  
The way you wrote your post, you won't even share the name...  all totally and utterly dodgy.
Not least you can't earn 1pc per day without someone being a Ponzi scheme.  It doesn't work.  Compound math anyone...
If it's so great, share the name, confirm you make ZERO commissions or affiliate payments from promoting it.

First, don't call my 'buddy' - I am not. 
Second, you have come on this reddit and post something that is factually not true.  You have not done your research.  You are not listening to people who actually 'get it'.
As I said, the wiki page for Bitcoin covers all this.
We are  at around 16-17m coins mined so far.  So 4-5m to go.  Last one will be c. 2040 from memory.

@_date: 2017-09-15 11:53:24
The market knows china is banning fiat to crypto. That should be largely priced in.  
I expect a fast rebound over next few days from current levels.
And if it ends up being a temp ban and exchanges are licensed then price will explode upwards.
Personally I think dangerous to sell now when you have no actual reason to believe it will go to 2500 apart from that is has gone down a lot.
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:25:47

@_date: 2017-09-11 05:01:51
The higher prices on Chinese exchanges is a good point (vs a few hours ago).

But never discount any possibility!
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:45:18
Good post.  It seems that following Jamie Dickmon's comments we have seen the CEOs of Fidelity, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, the IMF, all basically say positive stuff.  With caveats of course so they can wiggle out if needed.  
Standard stuff...
Some are speaking out to probably to look "cool", but Fidelity is deadly serious.  They already mine BTC.
And for Lloyd B to tweet (he rarely tweets) he is signalling that Goldman are seriously assessing.  They may not jump in, but they are taking crypto seriously.
If they do jump in,  ALL investment banks (maybe not the retail banks) that can, will follow.  Goldman sets the trends to be honest.  They have the smartest people of the banks.
(And some dumb ones too of course!).
I also know, as I have met many people in the industry to discuss this, that institutional investors (pension, life etc) and HNWIs are looking more and more seriously.  They literally have zero clue right now, however they know SOMETHING is going on.  And they know they need to gain knowledge.
2018 could well be the year that crypto goes truly mainstream.
It will be catalysed by one major player. Could be Goldman, could be ETF approval in US, could be a major player with $1T+ AuM decides to put just 0.5pc into crypto (that is $5B+...).
Long term it looks great.
Jamie Dickmon is irrelevant.
Totally irrelevant.

No he didn't.  
He said he would fire his TRADERS if they traded Bitcoin on behalf of JP Morgan (either for clients or prop trading). 
I know for 100pc for certain employees of JP Morgan are allowed to buy Bitcoin, my friend works there and has the Crypto Currency Trading policy (yes there is one!). 
Any employee can download it from Corp intranet.
Unless their policy has changed during the last 24 hours, it's the official company policy that matters.

One has to be able to get fiat into the crypto system.  Governments do control that still.
Denying this is futile at present.  Maybe someone works out a way to allow mass fiat to crypto with a ban from Gov from doing so.
Not impossible.  But I mean MASS fiat.  Ie $100m per day sort of levels (or who cares).

Well the entire banking sector did that :P, and have seen about $500B of fines so far.  I am not defending banks, just pointing out when someone (not you) said things that are inaccurate.
We actually do need banks, so they should not be vilified, however when a powerful CEO like Dimon starts talking about stuff he has no clue about (crypto) and actually moves the market too..., then he should STFU and go and ask his daughter to explain Bitcoin to him - at least she seems to be a HODLer!

@_date: 2017-10-24 03:52:26
Yes good point.
Well you either hold or sell.  No one can tell you which.
It’s a bit of a pointless thread to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:49:16
Of course they will be shutting down.
That is pretty obvious considering BTCC is...

Kraken is not a wallet...

If they can't trade to other fiat or crypto currencies they have to hodl :).  By definition! 
Their "supply" in-effect leaves the market.
If they can trade to other crypto then trading will occur of course, but no new fiat enters the system. That would lead to weird dynamics.
And of course some would get their crypto out of china (easy) and cash it out elsewhere (may or may not be easy but there will be ways).

It's not FUD, it's just silly advice as one cannot ever sell the highs and buy the lows consistently :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:23:23
He didn't say that.  He said Traders.  That doesn't mean all staff.  JPM employees 100,000s staff and will have under 1,000 traders
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:06:27
Lol it is not.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:10:02
That seems about right to me.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:36:35
Um, this is simply incorrect info.  MASSIVELY incorrect.
Please post accurate info.  It's not hard to check on CMC...
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:04:52

Go to  for yourself.
It's the TOP LEFT NEWS ARTICLE!
I.e. the  placement for the largest news.
You really think that is some dude trying to manipulate price.  You are insane.  This is real.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:33:44
Best advice I have seen on Reddit!
Build your crypto portfolio sure, but don't take out from retirement pot!  Also your crypto will be further taxes if it gains and you convert to fiat.  Remember that too.
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:56:28
Here we go...  All the exchanges will be announcing today.
And they will all amazingly be 30th Sept closure too!
I.e. it's happening.  Anyone who says this is FUD is total fucking idiot (although someone will say it's still FUD...  lol)
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:20:49
"STFU" - you are a mighty fine human being...  lol.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:03:55
We all know about the 159 deaths of Bitcoin :)
No one is saying this is 160.  But it's perfectly possible the WSJ has the story correct.  To just say it's FAKE is actually irresponsible.

It's a possible scenario.  If they buy them, they buy them.
Nothing happens really.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:17:19
Or difficulty goes down :)

He is an EX-trader at JPM, and also not CIO.
But he was a executive there.  WAS, in the past :)
It's still a good tweet!
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:15:00
That may be true.
However, it's also the same journal that for decades has reported on 100,000s of stories that were true.  Including rumours that became facts.
Don't get me wrong, they might be wrong.  The simple fact is no one actually knows!
However they are considered to be as high quality as the Financial Times.  If it ends up being an inaccurate story then I think the journalist is going to have a hard time keeping her job
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:41:49
TS for their clients, not for JPM.  Big difference.
But they ARE PROFITING from commissions for BTC 
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:14:25
Right.  This looks to be a prelude to regulations.  There is no coincidence those 'quotes' are in the article.
Everything is highly scripted in China Daily
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:11:38
Good post
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:24:14
Gold is worth $7T in total and it has not supplanted fiat.
I think that is a very convincing fact for you to ponder.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:49:47
It could fall 30pc.  It might gain 57.64pc.
Both could happen.
It's not "fake news", it's an opinion.
Might be correct, might be wrong.
Who cares.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:01:47
For days people have dismissed anything and everything as FUD.  Even tho there was increasingly mounting evidence that it was not FUD.
One can't post anything negative on Reddit without the FUD-brigade coming out.
It makes me want to stop posting analysis of situations in all honesty.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:35:18
Mempool anyone...
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:25:21
Good article :)
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:07:09
Still think this?
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:01:03
One doesn't just "buy" a banking license...
It's a bit more complex that popping on Amazon.
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:59:56
Which could be correct.
No one knows.  But asking WSJ to reveal sources (as some have asked for on reddit) it totally stupid.  No reporter ever does that.
It might be wrong, it might be correct.  Time shall tell!
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:58:41
This is awesome.  How much are the copies?  Please message me as I am sure you don't want this thread to be a selling thread.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:13:19
If 90pc of demand and 90pc of supply stopped trading then it would not affect price.
Price is a function of supply and demand
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:43:50
Excellent article
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:42:35
They are rumours.  Based upon conversations with insiders.  One can make one's own mind up on if one believes they are more or less likely to be true.
Clearly in this case the reporter has reason to believe what she researched over the weekend (prompted by Caixin rumours) is worth reporting. She will also be fully aware of the hate her article will cause.  She has been reporting on Crypto for a long time.  This isn't story  
I don't subscribe to the WSJ intentionally manipulating the crypto markets...  if they are then I will freely admit I was wrong and the world is a fucked up place, and I would buy more BTC :)
Having said this...
Do you want to hear about rumours in general in life?
Or only hard, cold facts?
The latter would be extremely boring.  There would be almost no news :)
Maybe that would be a good thing!
But it's not just rumours in this space, you don't want to know rumours about who may run in 2020 for President unless they have a press release stating they are?
The world isn't like that.  People should make their own minds up.
If the journalist is wrong in this instance she will likely resign or be fired. I think she is fully aware of that.

That is a good article.  Anyone who simply says "fake news" doesn't get China.  It is perfectly likely to be real news.
Very common for a leak before policy shift occurs. Just like the West :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:46:04
$7,700 USD?
That is well above the all time high which is just over $6,000
Are you in Zimbabwe or Venezuela?
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:06:35
Agreed.  To be honest it was fairly sure with BTCC alone.
It's time to buy just after OKCoin and/or Huobi announce (I would be surprised if they didn't announce today China time), as there will be a dip, event though it SHOULD be already priced in, but BTC doesn't work like that :D
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:14:12
Europe has had QE for about 10 years now!
As has US, and Japan.
What is your point?
