I've been waiting on a Bitcoin Debit card which I could use at any retail without the special POS terminal. Does Coinkite or NnB do this yet?
Once I swipe that card, the person who holds my Bitcoin account credits over USD to said retail, then debits that amount of Bitcoins from my account.

I missed the boat to in this in bitcoin, though I have a lifetime subscription, so I guess I have that for me.

They are basically saying, "We do not legally recognize bitcoin as legal tender, but it's your money do what you want with it."
I think.

I have done that before, but I am more talking about the extreme. Like your house burns down, water damage, all that shit.

What is confusing me is people using Bitcoin as a reliable source of income, it's not close to being '100% reliable' as an income.
