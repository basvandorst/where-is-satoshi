This takes time and lots of visibility by the masses. Being an advocate in your community and pushing stories with your local paper and local news stations that you are interested in stories about crypto and that you are willing to contribute stories about crypto.

You also need to take into account how much you will spend on the electric bill running your setup.

From the outside to people that don't understand the tech it looks too good to be true and everything in a normal sane person's brain would shout that it can't be real. Sad but true.

But isn't splitting the chain the new way to make altcoins so that there are already a lot of people out there automatically invested because they get just as many coins in the split? I'm not saying it is good for Bitcoin but it seams to be a surefire way to get people interested and fast.

Of course an Icelander knew this.

I was told that it isn't the same if you mined it as if you purchased it. If you mine it is a business and liable to be taxed as regular income.

I asked this question about what each person's moon was and got downvoted for it. I am genuinely interested in what the moon means to each and every supporter.
Edit to add that it was on r/btc

Or Gyna?

This is exactly what I like about Bitcoin. I've moved from country to country several times and there not being a huge bank hassle to access money is a huge thing. I mean think about it. What if Yellowstone volcano erupts and north America has to relocate or WWIII breaks out? Who is going to get out first to a new home? People with a currency from a country that is now worthless? Or the person with the currency that is a world wide currency?  If people just keep a security blanket in crypto that would make all the difference.

I don't understand why this was downvoted. I'm just curious on how the exchanges work when it comes to the sell and buy orders.
