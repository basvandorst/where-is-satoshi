We had a discussion on that one within our team :)  
  
Just like with the last halving in November 2012 ("the day of the first subsidy halving, which occurred when block 210000 was solved"), the 2016 halving will occur when the 420000 block is solved. Hence, the first halved reward will be attributed to the miner who solves this exact block.
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:13:29
There's not that much time left until the halving. It would be strange if it did die by that time.
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:29:08
All I can say is that our plans are short to medium term oriented. So, expect news sooner than later.
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:44:07
Our CTO recently wrote an article on the topic. We fully support moving to a larger blocksize and are prepared to upgrade the multiple full nodes we currently operate.

That's a great point! We'll add links to the quotes on our landing page. As for the Reuters  quote - we added the quote shortly after the story went to press and in all the excitement neglected to think about whether it really belonged where we placed it. You're right that it's less about us and more about the ruling. Our developers have removed the quote and replaced it with an excerpt from an ICE Totally Gaming article. Thanks a lot for your feedback - these are exactly the kind of insights we were hoping for!

These particular scams were related to stolen credit card information. Thieves just needed someone to "lend" their identity for fake accounts.

Hey. You can use [Cubits!](

@_date: 2015-10-14 14:24:41
We implemented credit card purchases fairly recently. In order to make sure fraud risk is minimized we opted for allowing purchases only with maximum verification level. This increases security of both our customers and us. After some time, we will definitely reevaluate the limits we set, and try to simplify the process further.
@_date: 2016-05-18 08:33:25
A few people from our team use N26, and there have been no complaints so far.
@_date: 2015-10-19 14:16:21
Sorry to hear about the problem. In case of verification failure, you get an email with instructions on how to perform manual verification. We suggest performing verification manually.
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:32:47
You will be redirected to a page where you will have a video verification session with the compliance manager. There you need to show your ID and complete the verification. The IDnow staff speaks English.
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:12:59
We recently changed our verification provider, and IDnow will soon have an English version of the interface available.
We understand this is troublesome for some users, but there is a simple fix in the meanwhile. Use Google Translate and simply switch the entire page to English.
Update: We included a small guide in the post. It helps English speaking users navigate the page.
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:15:58
Any payment method except for credit cards allows you to buy up to 150 EUR without verifying identity. Only phone verification is needed. As mentioned previously, we increased verification levels for credit card purchases in order to minimize fraud risk.
@_date: 2015-10-24 13:04:06
Here it is. We will think about making it more visible.
