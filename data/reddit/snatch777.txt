Nope, sell now!

Why, that wasn’t even the case. Fake reviews don’t help the community. Staying in honor does.

I was locked out of coinbase after that,  I attempted to resign multiple times. As a noob, I had no idea where else to buy ETH.   Not sure at what point I would have sold, maybe at $50 maybe not. I don’t sweat the could have 30K. It is not that serious for me. Infinite ways to make money, crypto is not the only way, bet.

I bought 100 ETH when it was around $10. Coinbase returned the transaction, they can go fuck themselves, that would of been around 30K today!

It’s probably from the hack, fake accounts, just sayin. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:28:07
Ok maybe

No one person has that much influence of price influx, it's bots, traders and algorithms fucking with your emotions.

Good effort, most likely belongs in an urban dictionary, tho.
