Wow that's weird, my verification took days but I did it some months ago.

Where do you see the next dip going to?

He literally said futures trade contracts and not actual Bitcoin.

But it’s traded like a stock. I see people commenting crypto is unique, it’s different. But it’s being traded like a stock on exchanges why would you expect price action to be any different?

Hey, I'm Singaporean. You can use CoinHako. It works like Coinbase, fixed buy and sell prices. You need to use Xfers to move your money onto CoinHako first. Buy there with fiat then trade on Binance.

Where’s that dip people were going on about?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:02:06
Why are you guys even watching it? Waiting to sell at 10k?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:44:48
I set up a limit order of one third of my coins expecting a dip, but I’ve since cancelled it. It’s taking so long to crack 10k that when it happens I believe it goes right through.

It’s 9 am in Toyko right now. What time do you wake up?

You’re certain it goes insane yet you think it will drop further. What does this say about you?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:19:50
Basically what I’m insinuating.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:34:55
Many Traders/investors saw breaching the 8k resistance as a bullish indicator. If it didn’t it would have gone down further yes. But now sentiment is it will go to around 9.4 at least.

It’s not too late to buy.
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:54:16
I go to bed at 3.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:00:23
It is in fact a tragedy. Guy and girl die at the end.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:26:44
What exactly are the indicators. Show us your chart.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:53:00
See what?
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:37:32
It usually goes down on Sundays? That’s it??!!?

For weeks I’ve observed only overwhelmingly negative articles from CNBC almost every day. Suddenly they publish this.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:35:39
If I’m normal, then yes.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:08:41
And why are you so sure it goes to 3k? Missed the buy at 6?
