Personally, i recommend that you just Hold your bicoin and even buy more. this is my advice to everyone here. And I'm sure that after only four years some people will become millionaires and others will regret  their choices.  [u/Griffaye]( get informed well and don't rush in selling. It's only a game of patience.

IMO gold and bitcoin will rise in the next great depression which is soon . But i think buying bitcoins would be better because it has a greater potential than gold for numerous reasons . from year 1999 to 2011 gold price went up 651% while bitcoin price go up about 8000% after every major correction.
Also in every aspect bitcoin is most practical than gold.
Good luckfor every one and for [u/aadi2053]( .
