So what do you do when you lose your hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:34:16
Yeah they do this crazy custom QR code, which is horrible and then they wouldn't let me accept payments for tokens. How can you be in the crypto space if you don't let people buy crypto currency with crypto currency.

Yeah they spelled differently and though they were both cryptographers and programmers (an incredibly rare skill to have) they wrote different code at different times. I mean come on no one could fake spelling! And it's not like I haven't copied and pasted coding style in half the projects I've ever coded. These little details obviously outweigh the incredible coincidence that a career cryptographer was the only person to communicate with Satoshi and then took up the project immediately, slept at the same time, had a neighbor named Satoshi, and disappeared at the same time. Come on they SPELLED different and had different writing styles! No one could fake that shit! ............................./s

Wow, what a horrible opinion of innovation. It is stagnation that is the enemy of growth and stagnation comes from control. It is precisely the control he talks about that is stifling innovation. Right now through traditional financing models it is difficult if not impossible to start a company. Crypto is breathing new life into the entrepreneurial spirit of America. The innovators of America do not want to slave away under the control he speaks of and never express themselves creatively. We need freedom to innovate and create. His system and the old way is where 1% of usefulness comes from. 99% of the waste comes from stuffy old offices where ideas are squelched and the employees work 50 hours a week to barely scrape by. He is on the wrong side of a thriving America. We can either take advantage of this technology as a country or continue to stagnate under total control in gray offices. Whatever they decide to do the rest of the world will move on this. The longer they wait to accept crypto currency and blockchain technology the further ahead the rest of the world will get because the other countries are not waiting. It's like Brad Sherman is declaring war on the economy of the next generation of the United States.

How come some people don't put spaces after periods? I usually see that in messages from spammers and fraud emails.. not that this message is bad, just curious.

I don't think the creator(s) of bitcoin really thought bitcoin would be the only one. I think the idea and why it is open source is that people would make more of them so that it wouldn't need to scale. Bitcoin was the proof of concept and then there was supposed to be a dogecoin etc..

Because after programming for 20 years I can tell you have the code or more I have in production is from other people. You definitely don't write everything you publish. Picking on a detail like that is absurd, naive and disrespectful. I think Hal should get the credit he deserves. That is why I am passionate about it. Often times programmers don't get the credit they deserve and just because of his circumstances working with the government etc... doesn't mean we shouldn't give him credit.

You saying that is better evidence than a guy conversing with himself.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:37:06
Who are these people who think someone wouldn't talk to themselves if they wanted to create a mysterious person? Seriously who are you logan343434? 
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:35:49
Right and Satoshi is still hanging out. Hey Satoshi, how ya doing? ...listens..
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:16:10
That's only a problem if you are constantly converting to dollars.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:23:18
It would take some sort of genius to send a message to themselves to throw people off. Who could think of such a thing?
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:36:22
Bitpay wouldn't let me use their service to accept bitcoin for tokens. That seems odd since they are in the business of crypto-currency. They want to support only a small part of the crypto-community. I say thumbs down.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:28:46
And EVEN if someone was trying to maintain secrecy what kind of crazy person would send a message to THEMSELVES!! No one would ever do such a thing, not even some kind of super secret agent. Imagine... sending a message to YOURSELF LOL HAHAHA. It tickles me to even think someone could do such a thing. Satoshi was obviously a mysterious cryptographer that no one has ever heard of, would talk to Hal secretly. Hal is obviously just a life long cryptographer who innocently received messages and then took up the project. It's a shame that Satoshi and Hal disappeared at the same time though. You're right. I guess we'll never know.
People are silly.. messages to yourself! They EVEN SPELLED DIFFERENT! coo coo conspiracy theories from some people.

Changing where the decimal goes would be disaster and incredibly confusing. It would probably be better to rename the currency to one of the smaller values but not call it bitcoin anymore. Just say how many finnies you have or something. Then you could use a different decimal, but you wouldn’t want to use bitcoin as the unit. It would still be bitcoin but you wouldn’t call it that for clarity. Like saying I have 1 penny instead of .01 dollars except even lower. That kind of works, but it takes a real ego maniac to want one currency for the whole world. If that is really what Satoshi wanted then I’m sure he still has millions of bitcoin and is going to use them at some later date because he would be a power hungry maniac.

Is there really a project where someone said they will eat their dick? I might be will to take a look at that one.
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:00:14
It's funny because some people think Hal talking to himself would prove that he is not Satoshi. Some people think it is that simple. You think it is the exact opposite that Hal talking to himself would be too obvious. That's just kind of funny to me.

Ethereum has smart contracts. Why do you think it is a shitcoin? I think Satoshi always wanted more than one bitcoin. Who would want people to go around talking about 0.00053 of a coin for all time. The number is just too low. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:55:15
The js and html is used to interact with the smart contracts written in solidity and uploaded to ethereum. Then you call methods on the smart contracts using the web3 library or truffle. All of our verification data is saved to the blockchain via the app. Soon you’ll be able to interact with it via the website as well. That’s what you need html and JavaScript for.

Thanks! That's a very substantial claim. I'll take this into consideration.

I used to think it was Finney. Now I think it was Szabo :/

ReceiptCoin.io, my company uses them to track ownership on the Blockchain. We also use them to distribute our tokens directly on the Blockchain. You can go to our GitHub and look at our repo  Smart contracts make what I’m doing possible because I can store arbitrary data about an object such as a hash of a photo.  I also have a Meetup group and teach smart contracts in Los Angeles if you’d like to learn I’ll give you a link. ReceiptCoin is like cryptokitties for everything. I encourage you to check it out. None of it would be possible without ethereum and none of the other projects are even close. I’ve been working with it for a year. The development tools are the best of any project.
