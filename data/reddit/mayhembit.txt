@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:28
Ok cheers - if it will only be based on value it will be fairly boring ride after correction. Might get 9% rise per annum if lucky like most other boring ass stocks. Unless like you said the tech takes on some new direction and we get mass hysteria again. If I had the bread I would 100% short buy back in on correction &amp; hold for 20 years. My plan is to invest on big correction and get there times the value. I'll also buy some other coins too.

She would say this was not my intention - mass greed, volatility , exchanges, Wall Street. It's a total bastardisation of my creation. It was created to free you from the system do not enslave yourself again.

I know  I'm talking about the block chain why did he not see the wsb coming in with big money and distorting the system. Reasonable buy limits would have solved it.

Not true - if bitcoin takes 5% of gold market it will be valued at 25k and IMO it will take more than that.
