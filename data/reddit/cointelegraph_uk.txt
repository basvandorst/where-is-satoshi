Don't disagree with you iphar, but regulation is a powerful part of the beast in this battle and I think brain will do better than brawn...

I agree it's hard to see the wood for the trees in relation to the UK crypto scene FlappySocks. The bill hasn't passed yet, so there is still light at the end of the tunnel...
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:24:23
Haha you have as much faith in politicians as I have FlappySocks. Have you a link to this bill?

Excellent, thanks Lewis!

Interesting loewan, i never heard anything about that! Can you give me a link to details about it?
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:17:41
Yes I like your quote "They will look for a way out and Bitcoin will be standing there, with it's arms wide open." leegethas. I see this as the most crucial time for Bitcoin since its conception with banks and governments openly pushing for it as they don't adopt something like this unless they are in control...
@_date: 2016-01-04 11:33:42
Glad you agree NoGenerals!

I agree with all of the above Francis, but how long are those points going to stay that way...

Hi Sukrim! I don't believe any of the players have set up a non-profit to make themselves a profit, not the point of the article...
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:40:14
I've spent 4 years promoting Bitcoin myself, founded and run a local non-profit, but don't expect price discounts for it to attend events. Sorry but you've lost me on the rest Sherlock, can you elaborate?
@_date: 2016-01-11 14:38:58

Great idea russellreddit, more savings on purchases like this is a big enticement to get newbies onboard! 
@_date: 2016-01-11 11:48:49
Your comment implies to me that you don't understand the nature of the Bitcoin economy nibbl0r, i entered it as a gamble around 4 years ago and for a £3000 purchase then would leave me with £300,000+ purchasing power today!
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:31:54
Big time magicalelf!
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:18:08
Apologies Sukrim, picked you up wrong there! Yes i agree with that, there are some great for-profits in the industry that support the local non-profits like Netki and Bitpay but they are few and far between. It's some of the FinTech start-ups backed by millions in VC capital in the same area as the non-profits going head to head against them instead of supporting them that I'm referring to in the article.
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:48:29
We will have a discount code soon Sherlockcoin, which should bring the price down. I agree all these events are very expensive...
@_date: 2016-01-11 14:05:42
Sorry nibbl0r but you've lost me now, I don't know what your referring to in the article that insinuates debit cards enables people to trade Bitcoin, unless you mean spending them?

Your welcome alexgorale!
@_date: 2015-07-28 12:46:26
I don't know what exactly is the problem with you here blackcoinprophet? The article is newsworthy because as the article explains in detail its a new concept that is an excellent idea for content sharers and with some peoples past sour experiences in the crypto industry with new business models I think it's very appropriate to let the community know who is behind it and that it is safe to sign up to. My previous comment on Alistair's post was in response to the replies of mystery about the lack of details about it which i was in receipt of to write the article. Your reaction and behavior to all this is peculiar to say the least!  
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:51:47
I can confirm this is legit and an exciting new concept for the digital currency community. The team behind this are also behind some of the most reputable businesses around the moment and have done a lot to help bring about mainstream adoption. Stay tuned to CoinTelegraph UK in the coming weeks for full details!
@_date: 2015-07-28 12:02:27
Hello blackcoinprophet! I believe you are slightly confused as to what has happened here as the link you provided by Alistair was his own tester of the communities reaction to the concept, whereby the article goes into in-depth detail of who is behind it and what the website will be all about for the benefit of the crypto community which i'm sure is newsworthy as the website on its own gives very little away in this regard. I'm sure we will hear a lot more about Sato.sh in the coming weeks and months ahead, it's a great idea and word will spread!
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:15:39
Chief Executive of the exchange platform Brian Armstrong stated that talks so far have been “positive and moving in the right direction.” I'm pretty sure they know roughly whether and when, they haven't spend at least 6 months in talks with the financial watchdog for nothing jstolfi.
@_date: 2015-04-30 11:07:42
Are you looking for a friend or what? Your still going on about this 17 days later! Have you provided the proof of any UK FCA regulated exchange that you've repeatedly claimed existed in that time yet? 
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:07:29
I think we have hit a point in mainstream adoption in regards to Bitcoin that the banksters really have no choice but to accept it or go bury their heads in the sand.
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:48:59
I just report the news Shaun, it's up to everyone to come to their own conclusions after reading it. I'm not going around in circles with you on the subject of "regulated" exchanges, anyone can check for themselves there hasn't been nor isn't any in the UK as of yet! If you can provide proof of just one Bitcoin exchange that has been or is a FCA regulated in the UK, i will humbly accept I'm wrong?  
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:48:49
It was in response to being asked "isn't coinfloor a thing?" You have lost me as to how that makes my title completely false Soveriegn_Curtis?
@_date: 2015-04-11 11:02:56
I'd say it is most definitely in the works BitcoinOdyssey, if you read the part in the article were the Chief Executive of Coinbase Brian Armstrong said to The Times that the talks with the financial watchdog had been ongoing for “at least six months.” This predates the budget report by at least five months,

Funny enough I told a man who has numerous other businesses and had registered his 1st Bitcoin business he wouldn't get a bank account, he went to his bank manager on Thursday and was told it isn't a problem. So it seems to depend who you are! 
@_date: 2015-04-11 13:16:16
Yes they told him it wasn't a problem jani8x, sorry i can't disclose business name until after an official announcement from the company.

In this scenario i see no difference in the banks and the regulations in question xbt_fan.

Interesting klmist as that is news to me and many others,what exchange is already regulated by the UK authorities?
@_date: 2015-04-11 10:57:07
 I have traded on it in the past and have a few ongoing issues with them, like they accessed my credit report and did a search without my permission. I don't believe this is normal, anyone else got a take on this?
@_date: 2015-04-11 16:01:55
Have you a link to any of this klmist, i'd be interested to read this as it is news to me?
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:54:52
Hi bitnumus it's nice to meet you too :) I believe it is you who has no idea what your saying. There is no and hasn't been any regulated exchanges in the UK as of yet as there are no regulations in place for them as of yet.
Coinfloor company co-founder and CEO, Mark Lamb, said:There have been no "regulated" exchanges in the UK as of yet, as there isn't any regulations in place yet. Coinfloor is not an FCA-regulated entity, but it has received "formal communication" that regulation is not necessary because Bitcoin is not classified by the FCA as money.
"However, we pride ourselves on our compliance even in the absence of regulatory guidance, and look forward to a point in the future when the HMRC and FCA may choose to regulate Bitcoin as a currency as we would be ready and confident about our immediate compliance," explains Coinfloor. "We believe that the creation of a formal regulatory regime for Bitcoin businesses (whether under the current payment services regime or under a new regime for decentralised currencies) would benefit the UK economy and in particular the fintech sector."

Thanks for pointing that out bitpotluck, appreciated!
@_date: 2015-04-11 16:08:44
Yes i've read the findings of HMT, and this is still an ongoing process. Nothing has came out of it in regards to regulation as of yet.
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:58:54
We must be on about different topics klmist as there is no regulations in place for the crypto industry in the UK yet!

Yes they are registered in the UK but you still have to use SEPA to transfer funds from your bank account in the UK to another country BitcoinXio.

Well that is the results of the survey I was given sumBTC, which i believe to be 100% credible. As far as I know it was only carried out in Belfast the main city here, and had a small number of participants respond.  
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:39:47
It's a lesson learned, bitcointalk haven't been to far off the mark with the majority of these sort of crypto companies!

It's the name of the game spottedmarley! I personally thought it was a very appropriate heading, your the only complaint. Then again you can't please everyone!

You have my apologises in regards to whatever offense you seem to have taken to the title as none was intended to anyone, but you do seem to have strong touch of OCD over it. If it was a fault with the content or writing style i would take you serious, but it seems like you have a personal vendetta as it's pathetic to focus on ONE TITLE you don't agree with for days on end! Are you connected to the VCs i quoted in it?

I agree it's already regulated by math! We have to look at the positives for now as we are leading the way in regards to being the most crypto friendly country in the world, and i have trust in the UKDCA team who have been instrumental in bringing us this far fighting for the right level of regulation. It's just a waiting game now!

As i have already stated it was the general public who responded to the survey and there was also a focus group held minty901. It was not an on-line questionnaire done by FB friends. The particular student spent their final year studying this subject very professionally. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 09:47:08
It's not a question spottedmarley, it's an article on the subject!
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:29:48
You are the one that seems to be flustered over an article title spottedmarley, it's unfortunate you feel so strongly about it but I've work to get on with and haven't the time to waste repeatedly replying to you on the matter.
