I'm consdiering using it as seed, but yeah same issue. I'm confused as to what the taxman is going to think about this (especially with money laundering between USA and mexico being such a thing of course)

it's Mexico. And there is always a further south if you put your mind to it :D

He runs a successful business and wanted to do me a solid. Long family history.  I just wanted to cash it out and not sit on it.
But now I'm realizing all the unintended effects that may kick in.

let's assume it's over the "gift" minimum amount ;)

thanks man. What are wire amounts that are safe that won't delay? Under 10k? And maybe spaced out over 2-3 day increments?  Or less?

but then what? how do i report it then? if it's after a year it won't get audited from the year prior?

Exactly that. Interested in Alts. 
I'm in New York State so my options are limited as well. May just wait for Gemini to verify.

So basically...
Mexico sends coin to me in states via exchange  &gt; I withdraw from Coinbase as USD &gt;&gt; I report to IRS that the amount was given to me by this person...and they may be tax liable in MX as a gift?

So no one wants to admit that this is China playing with Bitcoin like a geopolitical strategy using trillions of dollars to offset the trade war and destabilize Western interests...still...right? We're still ignoring this, right?

They're pumping funny money into Bitcoin in attempt to destabilize US (and Western in turn) interests. Are we still pretending this isn't happening?

I can't explain this in any simpler terms than I am currently. The thing is a house of cards. I believe in coins in the future but this is NOT the turn for it. What you are witnessing is two superpowers utilizing funny money to try to upturn the other. Mainly it's China right now, along with some Western interests just investing and shorting this thing.  They're pumping it full of stock to pull money out of 1% pockets and try to change the chess board a bit.  Anyone who doesn't see this is lying.  You've been warned.
