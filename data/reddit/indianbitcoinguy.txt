I know that. But I am asking for one to one transaction like in localbitcoins.com etc
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:51:03
But isn't it unsecure? like I am buying it from some other guy that may be involved in fraud?

Huh, I was just asking?
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:53:21
Yes These are two transactions. What I am asking is if in case C get caught(guy selling drugs), Can't Police track transactions of A and C worth $7000 saying that A bought some drugs from C? Even though it was B who was culprit and there is no way to contact B.

Exactly what I want to say, that peer to peer transactions are untraceable because sender and receiver only gives public address which don’t have any details of user.
So in case of dispute/police case, the one who transferred using fiat money is in trouble!

Can't other transactions be traced from bank? Like transactions between A-B and C-B can be traced. But in case of bitcoin, B can completely evade the scene getting A and C in trouble.

But Exchanges charge a lots of fees$$$!

Oh You mean by cash? because that was my last option tbh. I would prefer Bank Transfer, card or Paypal.

You are right about computers and cell phones.


Bitcoin transaction cannot be traced to owner because they are anonymous.

True lol.

I know I just bought few dollars worth bitcoins around 8$ from someone in localbitcoins. Next time I’ll be careful and buy from verified exchange even though it costs more.
