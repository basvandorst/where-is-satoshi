Can you elaborate?

You see, i believe that as a new pre-money or a commodity that has properties for it to become money, it needs to go through this evolutionary process. This has historically happened to gold and silver as well, and i believe that this will happen to bitcoin too. First, it needs to be collectible, then it needs to become a store of value and only then is it going to be a medium of exchange. The merchant adoption would be something for the future. Right now we need to develop bitcoin as the best store of value. As i see it bitcoin is somewhere between the collectible &amp; store of value phases, but every year it's moving closer to the store of value state. 
Right now, as it's market cap increases, as the comparisons to gold become ever more obvious and as the custody solutions improve, it will be seen more and more as a store of value. 
As it grows, volatility decreases. People prefer their day to day currency ie. their medium of exchange to be relatively price stable in terms of purchasing power. That's why i believe the goal isn't to spend bitcoin right now but to make it as good of a store of value as we can. And as bitcoin grows it's disincentives to spend also decrease.

Miners aren't in control of bitcoin. Full notes ie. users are in control of bitcoin. The user activated soft fork is something that proved that. More than 93% of miners wanted to increase the blocksize in their way, more than 85% of the companies/exchanges/wallet providers were on their side as well (just like many of the wealthiest bitcoiners), however the users and those people running full nodes decide what kind of code to run and what kind of transactions to approve.
I strongly recommend StopAndDerypt's "Bitcoin is an impenetrable fortress" for more nuance on this topic.

it's just predictions like you say, but i find it interesting nonetheless. Do you see Bitcoin recover after this so called Fuckening?

Forgive my ignorance, but would you be willing to explain what you two are talking about, or give me a term to look up and read into?

i'd like to know this too. Leaving a comment here

Got a Ledger Nano X earlier today! Setup was easy. Makes me feel more reassured knowing my coins are safe too.

Thank you for the reply :)

I learned a thing or two from this. I never saw downvotes like that before this, so thanks. Enjoy the rest of your day =)

You're free to downvote my comment, but i did not downvote yours.   
I also can't prove or disprove how accurate your prediction is, it wasn't even about that really. Instead of saying  "i could be wrong, but here's what i think", you bring it like it's a given fact that exactly this will happen, without any evidence to back it up other than your beliefs. Fair guess though, i'll give you that.   
And i don't know why i replied so passive-agressively, my apologies.

In October, not by. It can be anywhere until the end of the month

Don't you see how delusional you sound when you say something like this with no real way of knowing? Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's concerning the far future and when the topic is something as volatile as bitcoin.
