-.- you know what I meant. If you can abbreviate and slag off bitcoin cash as Bcash, the same can be done to bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:20:18
Except they are with on chain scaling. They have 8MB blocks which will increase as needed, just as bitcoin was meant to. The 1MB block size was a temporary fudge fix that Satoshi introduced to stop DDoS attacks on the chain, it was never meant to be permanent. On chain scaling was always the goal until blockstream took charge. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:27:18
Do you know what a large part of being a currency is? Being used.
You just can't use BCore as a currency. It costs too much.
You're here for the wrong reasons. This is not an investment, this is the revolution. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:24:48
Actually the original would balk at the idea of 1MB blocks - as that limit wasn't in place at the start and was never meant to be kept. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:32:47
It doesn't have segwit because bitcoin isn't meant to. It's far closer to the original vision of bitcoin than what core has become. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:28:08
Bitcoin cash is gaining adoption quickly. Many businesses that originally used bitcoin have switched due to lower transaction fees. The trading volume is currently about 1/4 that of bitcoin, and back in November it surpassed it significantly for a time. Bitcoin cash _is_ the cheaper option, and does not rely on offchain solutions such as segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:46:08
Except it spiked massively this year. It has all the sure signs of a bubble. It might be a year, it might be a few, but at some point it will burst like dot com. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:08:37
Why is Bcash okay but Bcore not?
As for centralisation: which coin was taken over by blockstream which proceeded to limit blocksize and push their own "solutions" that would allow all transactions and fees to be collected by them, a centralised corporation?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:27:36
A currency (like bitcoin was intended to be) has to be usable to be useful 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:12:22
Sure, it's not that bad at $4000 :\.
At what point is it unuseable to you? You realise bitcoin is a _currency_, right? Something you should be able to buy a drink with? Without a fee costing 10x as much as what you buy? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:44:06
Bitpay isn't controlling transaction fees? They're certainly not happy with how high they are, but they've got to pay the fees and therefore have to charge customers. They're working on adding BCH, are you telling me they'll keep their $20 (which is less than the average fee) on a platform where fees are 1 cent or less? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:00:51
Except it can be used as a currency, and everyone needing to run a full node is a lie perpetuated by this subreddit.
At this point I'm just wondering why I'm not banned here yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:16:24
But then you're moving off chain. The point of bitcoin was to scale and keep on chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:12:28
Have you even _read_ the whitepaper? That's entirely what bitcoin is about you mong. A peer to peer decentralised _currency_, which is currently not what bitcoin is due to blockstream, segwit and the Lightning, but entirely what it should be. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:07
Except that Bitcoin Cash follows the original intentions of bitcoin so core is the shitcoin rip off??? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:08:12
But they won't due to still extremely high transaction fees. They'll use Bitcoin Cash instead, where fees are only 1-2 satoshi/byte.
Plus, if you believe in the technology, Bitcoin Cash is far closer to the original visiom of bitcoin, and is actually able to be used for its intended purpose. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:00
How eloquently shit of you. You of course provided no actual rebuttal, just said you weren't going to waste time on me, then proceeded to do exactly that and say precisely nothing except a large paragraph of bog standard rhetoric. You haven't said *anything*. 
_Prove. Your. Point._ You're defending off chain scaling solutions; prove to me that LN isn't the mess I've read it is that leads to centralization by blockstream and allows them to take fees. Show me that Segwit is a viable solution, despite still having ridiculous fees even after a apparently 40% reduction.
 If you truly believe in your "true" bitcoin, you'd dump your bitcoin cash right now. Surely, if you had any significant holdings, you'd make a killing, no? And if bitcoin rebounds like you think it will you make even more profit.
Roger Ver isn't the universe. You think Bitcoin Cash will collapse if he goes away? There's 5 dev teams working on it, many from the original project before blockstream stuck its finger in the pie. People holding BCH want an actual cryptocurrency, they won't give up if Ver fucks off. 
You're surely also doing the same? Trusting that blockstream and others don't screw you over? Trusting that more people don't see the light that bitcoin's fees are far too large to be useful as a cryptocurrency, and what they think is saving them off chain actually isn't?
If you know you're right, _Grow up and show my your evidence._
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:22:05
But segwit isn't the right solution. Bitcoin was always meant to scale on chain with increasing block size, not with off chain solutions developed by a corporation. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:26:17
By the time they're full, technology will have increased under moores law that the people using it can realistically cope with bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:38:56
You realise satoshi himself said that scaling should be done with bigger blocks and that in the future he anticipates that no more than 100k people will run a node? He considered this more than enough to keep decentralisation, and the common user would only need a lightweight client. He's also said that by the time blocksize increases so much that today's technology cannot allow normal consumers to run a full node, storage capacity would have increased so that people could run one if they so wished.
Blockstream is the group behind the bitcoin core client now. They are a corporation, and off chain scaling will allow them to centralise through their services, and if bitcoin takes off like the original vision intended (somehow. Seems unlikely with thes3 transaction fees) then they would basically become the new world bank. You know that the technology for segwit and LN is likely patented by them right? For an open source project such as bitcoin, that reeks of centralisation. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:57:28
We had cheap transactions before. Bitcoin Cash managed to keep them, why not Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:44:22
Except the fee was meant to be around $0.01, not 5$ on top of your already exorbitant price for coffee. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:29:27


Congrats, you played yourself. Should have stuck with on chain scaling solutions like Satoshi intended and BCH does. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:37:40
Except that I'd assume any reasonable person could see that that's implied. A currency has to be usable, the value has much less bearing on its use. A $30 fee for a $5 coffee is what makes this effectively not a currency any more.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:16:56
Which no one plans to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:42:21
The point is that data storage is increasing and getting cheaper. Sure if blocksize now was 1GB it would be a disaster, only centralized nodes would be able to run. But in 10 years it might seem standard. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:35:28
Bitcoin was meant to be a currency, not a digital gold. Bch is closer to what's in the whitepaper. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:19:17
BTC is bizcoin. BTC is corporate funded by blockstream who intentionally keep fees high by keeping blocks at 1MB.  BCH is what bitcoin was intended to be by it's founder: scaling blocks, no segwit, etc.
Lets see how quick I get banned for this. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:17:36
Wait, it just disappears from existence if not verified?
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:43:26
Yes but the majority of people don't know or don't care I would say. So long as it's pegged against the dollar in value, people will "invest" in it to try and make quick money, buying low and selling high. If this wasn't the case, people wouldn't really care  about the constant price dips, which they obviously do. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:13:11
No, many people don't. Most people buying bitcoin see it as a FIAT investment. There will have been many investors who jump in around $500, and will likely sell at $5000+ because hey, they just multiplied their money by 10. Those buying now will wait until it hits $50k and so on. Most aren't in it for the new world currency concept.
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:28:32
Forgive me for being super late but I just want to understand this better: so transaction fees that get added to the block are removed from the system until a block is mined? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:46:45
Have you factored in your electricity costs?
