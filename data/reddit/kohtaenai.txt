There are even simple chrome apps that do this

For something "to be used due to a declaration" (aka fiat), there needs to be a central authority of some kind. A higher power. People have agreed to use bitcoin on their own, obviously no one told them to. 
BTC and BCH and most cryptos are exactly the opposite of fiat. 
If a government (or even employer, perhaps) decided to use it as currency, then you could make the argument that it's (kinda-sorta) fiat, but until that happens, it's an inappropriate word to describe BTC or BCH.

Totally right, someone comes across as an conceited asshole who wouldn't share the mic and refused to engage beyond reading from a piece of paper.
It's hard to watch this and not think "What a joke. Is this really the best they can do?" One side was *clearly* not interested in an actual debate, and just wanted to read talking points.
Everyone interested in Bitcoin needs to see this!

One person seemed really emotional. They were seething with anger. I guess they woke up on the wrong side of the bed or something.

Fiat means "by government decree". 
So no, we can't. You can hate BTC or BCH for whatever reason, but calling something "fiat" that has nothing to do with any government is just silly.

I don't understand, I can just download a pdf for free. Is someone going to print it out and mail it to the customer or something? Why is money involved?

Wow, that's pretty slimy. Please post proof, so skeptical people know to avoid him.
Thanks for making the crypto community safer!

everyone has a limit.

I'll do it for $450. And my advice is better, I've correctly predicted the past 4Q on BTC/USD charts. Trust me, I'm the best
People are talking about Bbands, but that's only half the story, I've figured out a way to synthesize data from the detrended price oscillator in a way pretty much no one else is doing. I bet u/tek-know doesn't even consider Chande Koll Stops in his reports!

so if they already have an internet connection, why do you think they need a satellite? In case the internet breaks, but only in their country, but they have electric to run a satellite receiver... and they need to view the blockchain, but don't need to actually spend money? I don't see how useful that is, esp since it's one way and they can't actually send a tx.
