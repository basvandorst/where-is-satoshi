any update on when can we check our balances?
Will the losses be socialized among btc holders only? What about the people who deposited btc after the hack had happened? Will they be included as well?

This seems theft to me which they are doing because they have the keys to my coins. Someone hacked and stole btc from bitfinex accounts. Bitfinex was not able to protect a lot of accounts they were supposed to. But a lot of other accounts were left unharmed. The unharmed accounts got locked down by bitfinex for days! And then one day they announce that no one but bitfinex themselves are taking away 36% from those accounts!! A lot of people lost money, no denying. A lot of other people did not lose money. Bitfinex is playing us, they are giving us tokens to trick us. Every token holder will keep the exchange alive so that the token value doesn't go to zero.  
I can understand the pain of losing money because bitfinex just now gave me that pain. But why bitfinex thinks it can decide for eth holders they will compensate bitcoin holders? Our wallets at bitfinex will see coins being debited without our approval.

why is eth being dragged in this?? No eth was stolen. Is this legal what you guys have decided?? Can the bitfinex tokens be traded??

I use coinsecure if it has better bids. Otherwise I use other exchanges. Now I will not do this and only use Unocoin or btcxindia.

I can't see anywhere the trading volumes of Zebpay. Can anyone from Zebpay team show us if the volume figures are correct. Other exchanges in India show their data publicly and are transparent. I find Zebpay to be very closed, they should be transparent about bitcoin trading on their platform. Do they even have an exchange platform?
