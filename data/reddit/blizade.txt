thanks for the info.  could you happen to suggest the best mining all-in-one packages thats out there?  i know it sounds like a no0b question, but trust me, i'm not a no0b.  just looking into some things.

yeah i know that, but are they worth purchasing for miniing?  i mean,  i couldn't find much stats on them, but i didn't look too hard, but im curious how many it would take to get a small mining operation going that might generate .5-1 btc/week

yeah that code isn't doing anything related to btc, let alone each wallet is coded differently.  so, this genius thinking his master code is some skeleton key for all btc wallets out there is just ridiculous, especially for all the cloud wallets that are available.  tell that dumbfuck to actually learn how to code instead of copy and pasting shit he has no idea on what it even does.  he just made himself look like a fool.

yeah thanks for the info man.  i already pretty much know the mining game is out of the question nowadays for us little guys, but i love the idea you guys are going for.  i'm always excited to see people pushing the envelope and coming up with new ways to use existing formats.  wish you guys the best of luck :)

wow, unreal.  thanks for doing the math on that for me and getting back to me though.  i appreciate it.

ah i see.  yeah that makes sense, but let me make sure i understand you right.  so 21 has developed this computer along with an api where people can quickly pay with btc and it happens instantly instead of having to wait for the confirmations and all that.  then in the mean time, it can mine btc (obviously not a whole lot) but 10-20 bucks or whatever it has mined thru the week for example you can use and experiment with them.  am i understanding you correctly?  because i was considering buying one, but my only use would be mining.

ah i see, so instead of trying to mine some real money with it just mine 10-20 bucks here and there and use them to pay for smaller services that accept btc.  makes sense i guess :/  thx for taking the time to get back to me tho man.
