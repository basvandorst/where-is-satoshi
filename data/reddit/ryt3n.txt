Wife is Lebanese, I am aware! Haha. A lot of it comes down to "if I go, I can only stay for two weeks"(work) - and two weeks feels like it's not enough/worth it. Does that make sense or am I just being stupid? Id have to spend days just saying hi to family I haven't seen in a decade.

I miss going. Probably wouldn't be the same now, it's been 10 years and I'm 33 with a kid now ha. Systematic chaos is truly the best way to describe it. I especially miss the beaches and food.

Couldn't we argue that with the different types of Fiat, as well? From every aspect. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:09:46
Is there a way to set an order and have it withdraw automatically when it's triggered or do I need the funds  in gdax already?
