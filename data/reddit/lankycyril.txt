No, it's fine to just stick to one exchange. It's just that I was running around trying different exchanges to see which one was finally going to let me buy.
I think people prefer GDAX over Coinbase due to the fees (but I'd also like to hear someone else's opinion on this). And it's best to transfer your crypto from an exchange to your own wallet.
As a side note: Monitoring the price on different exchanges is theoretically possible (arbitraging), but unlike traditional arbitraging, with such volatile assets and high transaction fees it's almost impossible to benefit from the price difference. Maybe arbitraging bots can be fast enough though. But arbitraging isn't something most people do afaik.

What the hell! I made my first ever transaction on Coinbase an hour and a half ago.
I wonder if it's me who's lucky here or it's you.
Obviously in the long term it doesn't really matter whether someone buys BTC at $13K or at $11K or at $9K as long as the vision is that BTC will go "to the moon."
But I wanted to buy when BTC was around $13K, couldn't for some reason apply through the Coinbase app, went with Bitstamp and been stuck on the verification step for ages (still am). So that stopped me from buying at $13K.
Today it turned out that I could resolve the Coinbase issues through the website, so I did and decided to pretend it was an act of fate: as in, OK, "fate" didn't let me buy at $13K and opened a door for me at $11K.
But maybe the same will happen to you -- maybe you'll be deterred now, but will be able to buy at a lower price when it keeps sliding or recovers but dips again? Time will tell.
