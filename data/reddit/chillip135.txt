I clicked on the TX and gave me that. 
What happens if I do another transaction from a different address to the same address, but this time I can edit the fee? The site I sent it from didn't have an option to edit fees...

You shouldn't be worried. It just hasn't been mined yet. It'll get to the address that you put in. 
However, so my transaction has been waiting in confirmation for the past 24 hours. If I was to do another transaction from the same address to the same address....would this trigger the miners or no? I just want to speed up this transaction...it's taking way too long.
I'm thinking of doing another transaction, but with a higher fee....if that speeds it up. I'm down, but don't know.

Thank you. Sorry, I meant to say that it was in the system. Since there are times when the TXcode doesn't even show up in the blockchain.info and gives the message..."Transaction does not exist."

Long transaction times...so if I buy something 6 dollars worth of btc....itll be in transaction hell because miners wouldn't look at it. So that means I won't get my food?

I had sent bitcoins from xcoins.io. I don't know how to delete the transaction from there.

A lot of the new subscribers seem to be assholes who don't really care. Nor do they know why they are investing in cryptocurrency when they have no clue what it exactly is.

what do you mean by publish?

Anyone that gets depressed by a sudden drop in price shouldn't be investing in anything.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:13:52
exactly, but some people do it as an "investment" to make money. Amusing how they are freaking out because the price of a bitcoin is dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:49
No, that's because the majority of the people don't know why they are investing in cryptocurrencies.

Investments have two results. Make more money or you lose. It's never too late to invest in anything. You never know what can happen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:06
maybe you shouldn't be investing if you don't know what you are getting yourself into?

The thing is at least 80 percent of the world still dont know what blockchain or cryptocurrency is. The vast majority thinks it's just a digital version of stocks when it's not. Until that 80 percent get their shit together, nothing will happen anytime soon. Even if it does, it's the 80 percent FOMOing the price all the way up again.

It's his life. How is that threatening people besides himself?

Korea is a huge market, but also the fastest market to die off. They are more FOMO &amp; FUD than any other country out there.

college students don't have money to start throwing money into bitcoin

What happens if all bitcoins get mined?
