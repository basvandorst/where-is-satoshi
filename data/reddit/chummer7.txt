These are both good points.
6 months ago I was considering buying in and kept asking people for advice. They all said something along the lines of those 2 things and it sounded like nonsense to me because I thought "dont invest more than youre willing to lose" was common sense (before I saw the stupid shit people have done for BTC like second mortgages)
I think getting speculative advice from a current holder is a lot better than going in blind, and if you cover your bases by saying "thats just my strategy though" they should have no reason to get mad if the market doesnt work out the way theyre hoping it does

Let's assume the lower ends of the ranges he gave, and a conservative wage estimate of $10 an hour, with his wife working 40 hours a week for $10 an hour:
(60hrs * $10 * 52) + (40hrs * $10 * 52) = $52,000 yearly income, before having an obscene amount of that stolen.
OP could also have kids, a lot of debt, or medical bills.
That's not a whole lot of money left over to be playing around with something you found out about because a subreddit circlejerked it to the top of a few times
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:08:07
They do. It's very well known
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:14
Yeah, makes sense. The memes and price threads are pretty stupid. Although, it's easy to get excited when your assets are gaining value so fast so I understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:45:11
This is the luckiest shit ever.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:14:56
Why isn't the voting system enough to hide shill comments?
I don't even own any BCH or care about the coin and I think it's dumb that comments that appear to sympathize with their "agenda" get swiftly deleted.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:19:29
µ is pretty standard in all sort of measurement units outside of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:39:06
Why is this significant? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:37
I can't believe Bitcoin is over $100! This is so exciting!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:12
Why? ^^^not ^^^saying ^^^I ^^^disagree
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:10:43
I see, I googled the quote shortly after. I just didn't know what or who "Chancellor" was, I picked up from the context that it was some message against existing financial systems though.
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:04:16
This makes me really excited for almost everything becoming independent and decentralized outside of government regulation!
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:29:00
i say "the fuck"
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:42:52
Not if he buys BCC
@_date: 2018-06-23 15:57:46
Greg is the reason BTC is worth so much...
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:31:19
Because BCH is an actual currency
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:50:59
Until fees are a fraction of what they are now, I doubt this will ever happen.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:10:03
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:45:37
Barely even remember them
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:55:31
what the hell is this
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:59:42
depends, whats your market cap
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:09:56
Propaganda is real here
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:08:54
How many people have told you how bad of an idea that is
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:43:40


Which is why I haven't spent a single Satoshi of my BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:00:52
Too bad he didn't say anything educated.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:07:52
agreed my dude
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:13:53
On that note, are there any open-source hardware wallets? Only way I'd ever consider getting one is if that were the case.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:16:03
Working on it today!
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:10:04
The title reads like a post from The Donald
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:47:36
here is my coinbase password:
there u go
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:30:14
Do you not store hashed passwords in a string field? What other data type would you store them as, int?
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:40:05
*lies about everything
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:06:05
Buy some BTC and BCH, hold both, see what happens.
Everyone has their favorite fork and it gets really heated when people try to justify why theirs is the superior one, but if you're starting off there's not much use worrying about it
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:38:27
Oh yeah, totally forgot it's fixed-length
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:16:37
Where did I imply storing them in plaintext?
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:15:55
ok, do u need SSN?
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:56:29
This subreddit would still find a way to spin it as a positive
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:23:19
Same. Still reluctant to move my money from Coinbase to paper wallet bc I like seeing the money on my screen...
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:35:32
Password limit isn't due to how advanced databases are, it's due to a defined limit of the string size in the ~~password~~ column
Edit: Hashed passwords are fixed-length regardless of the input, so this doesn't apply for passwords but would apply for usernames and other plaintext fields
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:16:09
Yes, that was implied. Some other people in this thread however are of the mindset that companies implementing a password limit to mitigate call volume is in violation of their basic human rights to set whatever password they please.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:09:16
Let me get this straight: You kept 40,000 BTC in an exchange and are surprised you couldn't get it out? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:42:36
What point were you trying to make? That lies about everything? How does my comment confirm your point?
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:12:08
I'm not saying it's a good or bad idea, but we live in a world where freedom is often taken away for "protection's sake" and this is one of many examples.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:09:25
Meh, I have 2.4 LTC. Bought at the absolute worst time and I'm holding out because I don't care about it
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:07:53
People propose changes to Bitcoin, and some people don't like it so there is a "split" where the blockchain forks off into two separate chains. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:00:29
As someone who has worked in helpdesk, I'm almost certain the max password limit is to help the client, not the database. The longer a password is, the more likely technologically inept people will write down their long password on a sticky note on their monitor.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:15:44
Yeah I know I can check my address on the blockchain but I was mainly being stupid/making a joke. The real reason I haven't moved money from Coinbase to my paper wallet is because I'm out of ziploc bags and I'd like to keep my paper wallet in a bag so it doesnt get water damage.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:08:47
This comment will never get to the top sadly.
