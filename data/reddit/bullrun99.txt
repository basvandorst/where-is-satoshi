Good for you

Crypto is dead, good luck to you. We’re not coming back from this and it’s clear what direction it’s going in. Bitcoin will be a couple of hundred dollars in a few months

Just save it to an Encrypted excel file to one drive , fill the folder with so much random shit and disguise it well enough and no one will be able to spot it among the sea of cat videos and memes. Hell stick it to meme image and save it as an image file. Good luck

Exactly

90% of the demand on coinmarketcap is fake. The only ones making money are the exchanges and bots

Most recreational drugs should be legal. The consumption rates are super high in most western countries it’s just were overpaying for low quality garbage and funding street gangs with the money

A lot of us came into it to use it as a currency. A year and Billions of dollars later we still can’t use any crypto to buy jack shit and Everyman his dog is dumping their bags back to fiat. The whole market is a complete sham and so is crypto. The world is addicted to fiat and looking back I was stupid to think if we had a enough people onboard we could change the world. This latest bullrun proved one thing and one thing only and thats that the masses do not control their own destiny because they are idiots and greedy. A big fu to all the people who exited to make a quick fiat buck. Hope you enjoy being at the mercy of the banks for the rest of your life and having that precious fiat mass printed until it’s worthless

No one is begrudging a small business owner or any business owner at all. What people take issue with is the disgusting level of profiteering. Like how much money is enough that you wouldn’t reward your employees with more to compensates. It’s seems like as soon as you hit a certain number it’s never enough and your employees become vermin that you love to hate and wouldn’t dream of giving an extra dime. That’s what people have a problem with!

Yeah I blame myself for listening to the idiot. Life lesson trust your instincts

Every time I brought it up my young brother just keep whining that it wasn’t worth it. I remind him of this at least once a month 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:50:52
Tell that to Twitter
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:59:55
I don’t think that’s fair

Ummm he didn’t actually sell drugs. He created a website, massive difference. People were using it for all kinds of shit, is he personally responsible for a 1000’s he’s never met, never spoken with, never sold anything to or bought anything from rather they all just interacted with his website. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:58:35
It’s pretty deplorable, he basically created an eBay / PayPal but Instead of be lauded as a genius hero like Elon he has been thrown in jail for life. It’s a funny world we live in.

It’s another fake out, it will be back down in a month. People fomo-Ing now are just buying the trader’s 10% pump. This is how they make a living pumping and taking quick gains. 10% doesn’t sound like a lot but 10% off 100k or a million every month is huge over the course of a year. 
Otherwise some one point me to anything that remotely justifies a 10% price rise, please I dare you.

Because Facebook is okay, despite the fact that people use it to organize drug deals all the time?

What’s you problem with him exactly ? I’ve never used Silk Road but I can appreciate that it provided a avenue for people to get drugs for medicinal purposes.
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:58:45
It would need to drop down to $3k for anyone to take it seriously again

This! I’m waiting for the next stock market crash ( which as I understand we’re long overdue for) then I’m going to dump a bunch of my cash into a low cost index fund. What’s the best one at the moment?
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:35:05
Why bother asking, just keep hovering up more top 10-20 coins every time it dips, then hold for 5-7 years, then retire. It’s an absolute guarantee. Stick to money you can afford to lose so that there is no incentive to sell, the bears will only control the market for so long... sooner or later their greedy hands will see eye watering cheap prices or they won’t be able to find anyone to buy from at dirt cheap prices. My guess at the moment is that bitcoin could hit 1-3k but I could be wrong so every month I just buy a little bit more because I believe in the practical application of the technology and the inevitability of use of the long term
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:45:35
I’ve collected enough, either they will be eventual usable in a real life setting or they will have their day in the light like bitcoin or they will be worthless. I’ve taken a punt and I’m sticking with it. Putting more in, no fucken way. Until major changes occur

I’m not day trading you clown, I’m waiting for reasonable price to enter which is completely different to timing multiply times to enter and exit. Only an idiot would jump in now the tech 2.0 bubble is about to go belly up 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:54:04
This is 100% accurate
