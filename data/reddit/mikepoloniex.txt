Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for us to assist in transitioning assets from a deceased user's account to their heirs and we do have a process for this.
We can certainly assist your family in transferring the assets in your brother's Poloniex account to his heirs. Please open a support ticket and a specialist will let you know what documentation we need, and walk you through the process.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

Then read the second comment.

Yes, the limit only applies to withdrawals.

Hi Rivozzz, 
The daily limit you see at the top of the Deposits &amp; Withdrawals page applies to withdrawals only, it does not include deposits as there is no effective way for us to limit those. 
Your trading activity is not limited and has no bearing on your daily withdrawal limit.
If you haven't already, we strongly encourage the use of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). If you're new to 2FA there are [help documents here](
Thanks for choosing Poloniex.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:08:09
Correct. However, as you can imagine, there is a practical limit to how much you would want to deposit, as you will be limited to withdrawing $25k per day. 
If you require higher limits, or an institutional account, that is possible by contacting support and making the request.

Of course we would not steal Bitcoin from a deceased customer's account. Not only is it illegal, it would be disgustingly unethical.
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:18:48
We published an explanation of why it cannot be done any other way. This was for the ETH/ETC fork but the same applies here:

To summarize. This post was a warning from claiming that he was losing BTC that he had on loan. When I asked him for his support ticket number so that I could investigate and report back, he deleted the post. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:29:20
Something is not right. Please post your support ticket number and I will investigate and report back.
For the record: In the 20 months that we have had P2P lending markets available, we have not had a single default.
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:33:58
Because I asked him for his ticket number, which probably doesn't exist. :)
We did recently increase the minimum you could offer on loan. This was in an attempt to reduce lending spam.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:47:05
Thanks for the support.
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:50:27
Sorry that took you by surprise. We do need to improve our outbound communications, especially for platform changes like that. It is something we are actively working on.

is not in contact with Poloniex as far as I am aware. - I have not been contacted with a ticket number and the support staff is not aware of any customer claiming losses from lending.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:14:00
Engineering is aware of the connectivity issues and is actively working on it.
@_date: 2017-04-30 01:28:45
Thank you. This is correct.
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:23:43
Sorry about that. It should be working now. If not, let me know.
@_date: 2017-04-12 22:01:46
Good to hear. The issue was on our end. Sorry for the inconvenience.
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:29:32
moving this to PM.
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:38:10
Sorry you're having trouble receiving password reset emails. Where did you send the support email? Do you have a support ticket number?
@_date: 2017-04-23 03:30:56
Sorry for the delay. I just saw your other message and asked Support to take a look.
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:44:23
An open loan offer can be picket up in total or in part, so your funds can be out with multiple counterparties.
FWIW: we have not had a single loan default since we opened the lending markets two years ago. This doesn't mean the risk is zero, but it indicates the likelihood of default is extremely low.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:53:32
We batch multiple withdrawals, so the individual fees are combined. -- Edit: other exchanges likely do the same, I just wanted to point out that withdrawals are grouped.
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:54:08
We are scaling as rapidly as possible in all areas to meet with the exponential growth.
On the dev-ops side we are provisioning new hardware continually and have increased our capacity by many orders of magnitude over the past 6 months. As you implied, we were doing roughly $7M in volume at this time last year, this month we exceeded $1B.
On the operations side there are limits as to how fast we can recruit, vet, train, and onboard staff. Especially any that need access to sensitive areas, as those need to go through rigorous interviews and background checks.
Everything we do must take into consideration the security of customer funds first.
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:02:54
They are warned when collateral is low and liquidated before they default. It is possible that a wild market swing could cause a default, but so far that has not happened.
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:42:40
That doesn't appear to be a valid ticket number. The ticket number will be in the upper left of your ticket, it will be a 5 digit number that looks like this:

@_date: 2017-05-06 01:26:36
When a trader opens a margin position, funds are automatically borrowed from the lending market at the lowest rate possible.
When lenders offer coins in the lending market they define the rate they're willing to lend them for and the (max) duration that they are willing to have them tied up. They can also chose to auto-renew the loans, which will put the funds back on the market each time they are repaid.
When a borrower is finished with borrowed funds the debt is repaid and the loan is closed. If a borrower needs the funds longer than the lender's duration, the original loan is closed and a new loan is opened from the lending market automatically.
As far as default rates - we have not had a single loan default since we opened  the lending markets two years ago. This doesn't mean the risk is zero, but it indicates the likelihood of default is extremely low.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:24:10
Sorry you had that experience, if you PM me your ticket number I can ask compliance to take a look at what happened.
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:00:33
Right, margin traders always have to maintain sufficient collateral to pay back the loan.
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:21:38
Our support portal does not use your Poloniex login for just this reason, it's a separate system with a separate login. 
Who did you email?
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:23:24
Withdrawal limits are not self-imposed, they are mandated by FinCen.
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:25:26
Do you have a support ticket number?
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:25:01
Ok, thanks for clarifying - good luck getting it sorted.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:44:53
Sorry about that. Can you PM me your ticket number?
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:12:23
Good to hear you got in. If it happens again open a support ticket, PM me the ticket number, and I can look into it further.
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:04:23
You probably have an open position. Check the "Positions" section in the sidebar of the Margin Trading section.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:45:45
Hi new Redditor. I don't see how an account could be locked for 5 months unless there was something very suspicious/wrong with the activity within it. Could you please post the support ticket number?
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:03:36
We recently implemented new security measures and some logins now require positive email confirmation.
The support site is a separate system and does not use your Poloniex login. (if you cant access your Poloniex account you can still access support) You would need to create an account on support to file a ticket.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:34:44
If you're referring to that sub is not controlled by Poloniex.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:00:51
I got your PM.
Your withdrawal has since been processed. We have systems in place that can catch and halt withdrawals that are deemed suspicious based on a scoring system, occasionally these systems throw a false positive. I'm very sorry for the delay in this withdrawal but I hope you can understand that this process is for your own protection.
We have had an incredible influx of new accounts in the past several weeks and our compliance team is currently backlogged on account verifications. We're working as fast as we can to clear the backlog.

@_date: 2017-06-07 17:48:47
I agree, I wish it were that easy to outsource. Crypto exchange support issues are quite complex and the access staff needs to resolve theses issues is sensitive. Hiring, vetting (with background checks), and training support takes quite a bit of time.
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:02:35
Uh, what? We reallocated the mods to support, that is all.
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:00:20
Sorry you had a bad experience. We're working as quickly as we can to (safely) bring on new staff. We're also integrating systems that will greatly reduce the verification times. I know this is little consolation for your situation, but we are working on it.
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:15:00


Because we're required to have an AML (anti money laundering) program. To meet our compliance obligations, as well as for consumer protection, we have audit systems in place that flag certain activities for review. Unfortunately these systems sometimes throw false positives which require manual review.
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:51:03


No, they were not volunteers.
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:45:37
I answered a similar question a few months ago. Only difference being that we're now around 50 people.










* We are a 30+ person company and growing rapidly
* On top of the 30 we have an incredible legal team (10 deep) that is very on top of the regulatory landscape
* We're actively, but quietly, working behind the scenes to help craft decent, sensible, regulations that benefit the entire cryptocurrency community - not just Poloniex. [Sometimes publically]( but more often [anonymously](
* The company is registered in Delaware but our corporate office is just outside of Boston
