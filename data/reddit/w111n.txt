be patient, look for a bottom to build
I think 9k 5k or 2k are 3 possible levels to watch for

It's easier to find a bigger fool here :)

I think it's already done.

I agree w/ your analysis:

I think many already do. BTC was the original, but it hasn't received appropriate updates. If kept like this, sooner or later it'll never rise again from a crash while better tech wins.

I've asked several times on that channel but never gets a reply. Is your experience different?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:48:13
No. I got this from the bitinfocharts website.

I think for BTC top 1000 accounts have 34% coins and for BCH 42%. This is about the same as the outside world. 
How is this helping wealth equality ( which I also support, but u think that's because I'm not rich ).

Just honest question: how many people here are just investors or speculators and how many have deeper commitment to BTC?
I'm not sure if there's a war. From an investors perspective I only care about whether my coins will go up, when it'll fall, and when it'll bounce.
I'm not into conspiracy theories.

Nobody asked you to buy into the pump.

I hope it has a hard and deep correction so I can buy more at lower prices. I sold all yesterday. 
It is against the interests of small investors if the price only goes one way: the rich get richer, the poor can't afford to get in. 
Let's be honest, 99% if the people don't buy Bitcoin because it stands for freedom. They buy because it makes them money.
