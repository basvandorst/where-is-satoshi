Seized funds can actually be used for more toys for law enforcement. It's like a secondary funding source. I think they'd definitely be a little more reluctant to chase these guys down with less incentive.

Only if you already have coins. Obtaining Bitcoin is much more annoying and less convenient than just pulling out my credit card or using the one saved to my buying account on a website.

Yup that's why he's average Joe and not Millionaire Joe.

God forbid we verify how donations are being spent. Let's not let our desire for a feel good story blind us to the need for accountability and transparency. If I'm going to give money to feed the homeless I want to know it's being spent efficiently. I'm not going to take anyone's word for it and neither should you. 
I'm not saying Sean's Outpost isn't doing a great job. I'd just like verification. That verification can only help gain more donations to feed more homeless by showing everyone why we should have faith that the money is being used appropriately. It can't hurt. 
However, if Jason can't or won't verify where the money is going why should I trust him at all? That situation can definitely hurt the homeless people that he wants to help in the long run. I just don't see why you wouldn't want to verify and gain the trust and faith of more potential donors.

It's got a pretty strong foothold in the darknet. I don't know of anything that is as universally accepted on online black markets.

The difference is many of us aren't okay with that risk but still want to help. The only way to rectify that is to be transparent. Not only will it appease those of us that want to help but don't want to become someone's personal slush fund, but it will also generate more trust which could bring in more donors who may have been wary. If this is truly about helping the homeless, let's drop the ideology and do what's most likely to generate more help.

This statement is based on the assumption that Bitcoin will be the currency to win out all over cash societies with unstable currencies around the world. It's a big assumption to make. Not impossible but far from a sure thing. Don't get me wrong I own some bitcoin. I'm just not as convinced as many here that it will be the world cryptocurrency. It's certainly a game changer for places like China with harsh capital controls. It could be superior in places with extremely unstable currencies. That, however, doesn't necessarily translate to it being a game changer for westerners, which is the majority of the people in this forum. So yes I will certainly agree that it has a greater utility in the developing world, oppressive regimes, and places with unstable currencies.

And as I said if you want to send money it's only easier if you already have coins. Otherwise you still have to jump through all the hoops to obtain them which are nearly identical to setting up a Paypal if you use Coinbase (arguably the easiest faux-exchange) . On the receiving end it's easy to get them but if you want to cash them out for USD you need an account on an exchange so you're back to square one. If Bitcoin was already ubiquitous I would agree with you but we haven't reached that point.

That's cool, but average joe isn't selling all that many goods himself online. Average Joe is primarily a consumer so your situation doesn't help him.

Exactly this! For instance I have friends who want to be cable cord cutters. Their solution is Netflix, Hulu, and googling stuff. I tell them about XBMC and using sickbeard, couchpotato, and my personal favorite flexget to automate their system for free. Their response is basically disgust that these things require set up, occasional maintenance, and troubleshooting. They'd rather pay for Netflix and Hulu plus because it's easy rather than have a free superior solution that requires effort. That's the norm and always has been.

I can post my paypay :-)

Really? The instructions and setup are on PayPal.com. Show me an exchange that is more simple. The closest would be coinbase (not s real exchange btw) and it has nearly identical setup to PayPal except that if you don't already have a credit card buying coins isn't instant.
Edit: Also there's the issue of cashing out the coins themselves for USD. I don't really see how it ends up easier once you include the front end and backend work.

Investigations are often triggered based partly on that sort of information. That's why a front and money laundering are necessary to self sustaining operations.

That was all true until it became cheaper to own a computer and have Internet. When Internet became $10 a month during the netzero days and free trials abounded and people already had bought into computers for work reasons it became easy to see why a computer with email and instant messaging was superior to an expensive per minute nationwide calling plan. It was WAY cheaper. The infrastructure was already there because of government investment. And companies pushed adoption hard. Bitcoin is a very different situation. No government investment, no telecoms profiting from it with an incentive to show the consumer it's better.

I'm an average joe. I'm familiar with Bitcoin and while its an interesting technology I have no need for it. It doesn't really do anything better than my credit and debit card yet. Sorry I'm having trouble understanding what you think Bitcoin does that I need currently.

Probably. With skill comes dat arrogance doe! But seriously that's what it seems like this boils down to. He was making mistakes left and right. Many the exact same as what took down SR1. This is so bad that you almost want him to be an informant who went rogue. At least that way he just didn't care because he thought he was protected. The truth, however, is that he probably thought he was much better than he actually is and got complacent. And complacence, arrogance, and confidence are the enemies of OPSEC.

Probably not, but the question is what does Bitcoin currently offer the average Joe. I'm not at all disputing that people can make money on Bitcoin by getting in early, speculative investment, and all that. It could also bankrupt people if it ultimately fails or is replaced by something else. Regardless all of that is irrelevant to the question of what Bitcoin offers the average Joe.

I knew about the bank support part, but not about how things were previously. TIL. Thanks.

Yeah that's pretty much how I feel, but I'm willing to be proven wrong.

But what incentive exists for an average guy like me to obtain bitcoins and buy things with them over using currency that I already have, is accepted everywhere, and doesn't have lots of volatility.
I like the idea of bitcoin, but I'm not trying to move wealth to another country, and I don't intend to in the near future. It just seems like bitcoin lacks utility that could incentivize large scale adoption.
