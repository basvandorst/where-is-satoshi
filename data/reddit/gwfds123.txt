I do.
Been here when there was around 2k subscribers.
Here is a post I made back then.
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:57:45
Everything changes with more people. Remember being excited the sub surpassed 10k so quickly. Ideas were freely talked about and new. Don't mind how it is now though. Everything is still there, just a little harder to find.

I'm glad they made this decision.

Contact MtGox. Don't just wire it back in to his bank.

2) Is getting hooked up with Mt. Red the most efficient way for me to get involved or started with mining?
For most people, joining a pool will be the most efficient way to mine. Mt.Red is relatively small so there might be more time between discovering new blocks but it should average out to be the same as the larger pools in the long run. I recommend a larger pool if you want to get a consistent return.

The mods never said what they intend to do with the donation... If they did, they should make it more apparent. It could be donations for a moderator for moderating @_date: 2011-06-28 05:22:39
The wallet has to download all the current blocks before it recognizes how much you actually have. It is around 133000 or so.
@_date: 2011-05-21 03:24:22
Yeah, I don't like the idea of letting the shareholder have the final say. They don't own the subreddit. There is also no point in posting this if that's the case.

A P2P nation without any national borders. Where the citizenship was not  totally determined by where you were born. A place where you may have a choice to be involved. A new future where you can promote a secular society at a global scale. Where money is voluntarily used to promote science rather than war. It could be a new democratic revolution in which the people rule. Volunteerism could be pushed to new heights backed by a loose associations of citizens. Been waiting to fight for yours and other peoples human rights? Here is potentially your chance.

I'm up for giving 1 BTC to the runner-up.
@_date: 2011-05-23 20:08:48
Maybe he bought the rig from the bitcoins he mined earlier.
@_date: 2011-05-25 19:43:25
You can change how much you charge yourself in settings on your client.
@_date: 2011-05-26 17:50:54
It seems to be expected from this type of system and isn't so bad as you made it out to be. The whole purpose of bitcoin is that isn't controlled by anyone person. I think of it as giving the people their bartering system back. If I remember correctly people did not like taking paper money to begin with too even when it was backed. I think many reasons that you gave is the reason why people like it though I do see why you would be skeptical. I think it's important to point out the faults. 
@_date: 2011-05-22 02:07:33
I wouldn't mind seeing Randell's opinion on bitcoins 
@_date: 2011-06-07 00:25:51
Nice try DEA
@_date: 2011-05-21 02:27:43
I think it would be easiest if you can transfer from phone to phone while still hooked up to the network.
@_date: 2011-06-05 02:03:35
2x5850 600 Mhash/s
6850 200 Mhash/s
so 800 Mhash/s total
around 33 dollars a day at current prices

The fuck is going on?
@_date: 2011-07-03 06:47:40
Go to their IRC? PM one of the admins. Some accounts are just harder than others to reclaim. I had 2 accounts and one of them i had to go through IRC to reclaim. 
@_date: 2011-06-11 22:39:42
I'm not saying the price should be higher. I just believe the prices would be more stable if it were closed or limited on the weekends so there an equilibrium of sellers and buyers. I asked it as a question. Perhaps there are better solutions. 
I want bitcoin to succeed as a currency. People won't have confidence in this currency if the prices are so erratic. I was just proposing something for now. 
@_date: 2011-07-20 22:10:53
I agree with him. If you don't want to do it that way then my address is the first one to give 1 btc.
@_date: 2011-05-20 17:54:14
It's used to secure the network.
@_date: 2011-05-22 17:17:17
It would be cool if it has an option to add an alias and a search function. Seems good even without it.
@_date: 2011-05-24 19:54:24
I'm sure it doesn't need to be pointed out. People can get it legitimately if they wanted to. This maybe a faster option than searching on a different site and some people genuinely want to pay for their product. It has nothing to do with bitcoin except that it can be a good way to pay.
@_date: 2011-05-26 10:30:17


Guarantees it in what way?
@_date: 2011-05-22 20:18:01
People may have opinions but I think it's better if the mods and the subreddit remain objective towards the community. I'm not necessarily saying I'm against libertarianism or anarchism. I would even welcome discussion pertaining to them with the subject being bitcoins.
I should add that I think "Bitcoin has the potential to dismantle current political and economic structures by eliminating the need for centrally-controlled currencies" is too suggestive.
@_date: 2011-06-08 08:11:16
I just checked it out and you're right. I am currently running in BTC guild so thanks for the info.
@_date: 2011-07-02 03:36:57
It's .47 BTC. A few dollars worth. Seriously?
@_date: 2011-06-08 07:14:54
I recommend BTC guild or BTCmine. They have zero fees and are large enough to get a steady payout. 
@_date: 2011-06-05 03:02:56
@_date: 2011-06-16 02:33:40
They want to be the "good and safe" way to exchange. People don't have to use MtGox if they want to do it a different way. It may even be necessary if you want bitcoin to succeed. I'm sure there would be alternatives that will tout the freedom side of bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-09 10:09:22
It would take a little over 2 weeks.
@_date: 2011-06-08 04:08:33
Sure! I would be honored.
@_date: 2011-06-06 14:56:01
Where you can determine your BTC rate per Mhash/s.
 
@_date: 2011-06-09 03:13:39
I believe it's worth it. It will take around 2 weeks to pay back if you're just getting the cards alone. You can get 300 MH/s for the 5850 pretty easily.
@_date: 2011-06-11 23:14:00
@_date: 2011-05-31 22:47:46
Thanks! Donated.
@_date: 2011-06-04 10:49:36
$640 milliion+ USD?
Doubt it. Mining would be way too profitable. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 10:41:01
Maybe the volume is too low to change the price. Since it seems to stay steady at $30.
@_date: 2011-06-01 02:58:57
Can't pay for the site maybe?
@_date: 2011-05-31 21:23:24
I'm willing to add funds for this as well. 
@_date: 2011-05-21 02:52:00
I like that it's small and simple.
@_date: 2011-06-03 09:16:42
1 BTC is currently worth 44.6 PLN(16.30 USD)
Is there reason for polish people hold in BTC rather than their currency? A good target for it in USD?
@_date: 2011-05-23 05:39:08
@_date: 2011-07-20 09:38:04
I guess I lost my 1 btc to him? hmmm
@_date: 2011-06-03 09:40:26
It seems so... PLN  and GBP is around 16 USD right now.
@_date: 2011-06-11 22:41:53
I agree but Dwolla doesn't clear transfer during the weekend too. 
I guess I shouldn't have posed that it was the fault of MtGox but the problem with other institutions. 
Edit: Too make clearer. 
@_date: 2011-06-05 23:15:51
Guess I'm making multiple accounts.
@_date: 2011-06-07 01:17:13
Donated 1 BTC
@_date: 2011-05-22 20:55:29
I can totally see the ideologies going hand in hand with philosophy in using bitcoin but I still believe the mods should not suggest that conclusion to everyone.
@_date: 2011-05-25 05:55:50
Your money is in the wallet.dat file. I assume if it's online then it's not on your computer. You would not be able to access the wallet if the service went down.
@_date: 2011-06-04 22:36:23
I can invite a few people. send a pm
@_date: 2011-06-09 01:39:29
You don't pay anything to sign up.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:30:34
Not true. I just got the email 30 minutes ago.

That sucks... sorry to hear.
