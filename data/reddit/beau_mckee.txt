Commonwealth straight up blocked any transactions to Coinbase from my account. No explanation was offered. Been in the process of migrating away

Genuine question, why do you and some others so passionately hate bitcoin cash? Isn’t it the more accurate vision to bitcoin than the segwit bitcoin we’ve been forced onto? Not trying to rock any boats, but that is how it appears to me so far.  I can see why this would be considered a threat to some. I’m interested in looking for genuine discussions so I can formulate my own opinion, not name calling/ taking sides etc (currently invested in both)

Bitcoin isn’t going away, but is definitely losing market share. That’s going to happen when you have no real competition on day 01, new products and services will emerge. I’ll keep holding both bitcoin and BCH

Here in Australia, that stand will go up in value if the Aussie economy tanks (looking likely right now)
