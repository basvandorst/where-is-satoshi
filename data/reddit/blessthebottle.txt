One is like 110 years old. The inference from this post is crazy speculative in of itself.

I'm getting out of crypto until the new year. The valuation for cryptocurrencies is absurd. $600 billion. Even Vitalik Buterin is at a loss of how to explain this market. We're officially now in a bubble. Long term prospect is still great, but this is moving WAY too fast.

Looks like it's paying off. Separate the emotion from investing

This. CME futures are cash settled. They are not settled with a deliverable. 
Pretty much every future on the CME is delivered once the the contract reaches expiry. Corn is settled as a deliverable, oil is settled as a deliverable, even interest rate futures that trade T-notes are settled with a deliverable. How can a contract that has no effect on the underlying shift the price of the underlying? This seems like some self-fulfilling prophecy shit.

This isn't "investing" anymore. We have no way to value these assets. The last time that happened, we were producing synthetic CDO's. 
When people are trading based off of price, instead of value, that is worrying.

Have you seen the CEO of SALT? He is a former restaurant manager that lost a ton on bad investments in restaurants. There's so much garbage out there getting pumped.

Lol. GL to the rest of you. I'm outtie until I have the time to re-evaluate what this all is worth. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:51:01
I actually did leave 0.029 of BTC left in the account. I basically took out 90% of it though. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:43:31
Ty for the clarification. 
Why is there so much money going towards centralized exchanges then? Coinbase, Kraken, Xapo, Bitstamp? (I'm assuming these are all centralized?) I thought the whole idea to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is to be decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 02:25:36
It's not a currency yet. Just because people are willing to barter with bitcoins doesn't make it a currency.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:22:22
Finally, a legitimate answer with no bullshit. I understand that the long-term prospect of Blockchain and Bitcoin is safe (mainly because Blockchain is genius), but the short term fluctuations in price will destroy many speculators if they think that the price can only go up. The only way we can get around this is if exchanges are decentralized, and from what I understand...they're not--at least not the ones where most of the money is in.

Prohibition lasted 13 years and caused a huge disruption in the market of alcoholic goods. I'm not looking to keep savings on the black market where there's poor liquidity and complex methods to spend currency. I keep asking the same question as to how Bitcoin will circumvent countries that shut down the exchanges, thus the market as well. I don't see why countries would allow Bitcoin to gain more momentum and undermine their central banking endeavors. I'm bullish on Bitcoin, but nobody can answer this for me.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:27:08
You can kinda reverse something if you were to make another transaction that undoes the previous one (2 entries would be posted). It's not a true reversal, but I thought it might be possible.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:02:18
So technically, if there was an issue, it would be picked up by multi-signatures/confirmations? How would this work in practice if I understood that correctly?
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:22:36
huh? How would a VPN stop a country from banning a centralized exchange carry thousands of Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:27:50
I meant atm as in at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:48:11
It seems to me that you only need to take out the exchanges of the G20 nations. Nobody is gonna want to keep money in a country that isn't politically stable. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:30:39
Or they could just get service providers in each country to ban online exchanges, effectively taking down the local market, no? What's stopping governments from banning all of these exchanges? I understand BitTorrent and Piratebay have survived due to mirrors and its decentralized network, but it doesn't seem like an effective solution for a potential global reserve currency.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:50:24
So when they shut down exchanges, won't people lose a lot of money that were in the exchanges? I understand this is very similar to sites like BitTorrent, but you have nothing to lose if they take down the site and mirror it shortly after. Many people have holdings at their respective exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:06:35
The underground market is not a suitable market for a very liquid asset that requires widespread adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:15:47
Liquidity for markets don't increase when exchanges are shut down...it's just the inverse. Imagine if the Nasdaq just stopped trading. You think Apple would be still worth $750 billion?
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:17:52
Governments will band together in a second. Ever hear of the G20? They all have an interest to protect fiat currency since that's what their governments run on. I'm growing increasingly skeptical of the currency by the shortsightedness of these answers. Surprise me!
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:18:32
I definitely understand it, but I do underestimate it. People should be skeptical of a currency that is looking to replace the global reserve currency. I'm looking to rid myself of any doubt about it by debating any weaknesses I see. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:19:18
Thank you

^ What he said
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:14:35
If exchanges start going down, the currency will sell off greatly. If everyone withdraws their bitcoin it will be without value. Nobody wants to use a currency that has no market. You might be able to trade with some small businesses and friends, but that's no $70 billion market. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:12:22
I think it is relevant. 
If the Nasdaq (market) was halted, liquidity would decrease and create a downward pressure on prices of the underlying (stocks). 
If Bitcoin exchanges (market) were halted or banned by governments, liquidity would decrease and create a downward pressure on prices of the underlying Bitcoin (currency). February 9th, 2017 in China shows that (even though it was just a 72 hour withdrawal halt).
Can you explain how exchanges are completely removed from any political intervention?
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:48:50
I just watched the entire video. When he begins talking about the sell off of the Indian Rupee and how Bitcoin spiked, I don't see it. 
Can you post a chart to what he was talking about? I don't see any spike on November 16th, 2016. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:20:27
If you shut down the exchanges in the G7 nations (Japan, US, Germany, Canada, UK, France, Italy), the market is effectively shut down. Nobody will send money through exchanges in politically unstable countries. Peer-to-peer would work if the price of Bitcoin was stable. The price of Bitcoin will not be stable if they shut down the exchanges though. 
I understand that Bitcoin can't be officially shut down because of the way that it coexists with the Internet. The demand (thus prices) for it can be materially affected by shutting down exchanges. This is essentially the same thing as shutting down the cryptocurrency. Sure, people will still be able to send BTC peer-to-peer, but it won't be universally adopted, and that's the same as the currency failing imo. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:13:11
I still don't understand how the market will continue to grow if exchanges are shut down. I understand Bitcoin will still exist, and it can continue to be traded peer-to-peer, but the exchanges are vital to the continuance of the currency. 
So we're in agreement that exchanges are vulnerable to political intervention? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:20:23
I don't expect it to. Although, I do expect it to become the next world reserve currency unless there's some vulnerability that I'm overlooking. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:26:58
Very interesting. But the reason why the volume and price recovered is because of a 72 hour withdrawal review if I'm not mistaken. The fact that it recovered is because of compliance with the PBOC. What happens when governments shut down exchanges because of a flight of capital from fiat currency to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:46:03
Every asset and market cycles. To not have longs and shorts in a portfolio is dumb. Those that HODL and only are long have no idea what they're doing from a trading/financial perspective. Many will go long on an asset and short whenever the asset becomes overbought.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:32:10
I guess they aren't :P But they are for me :)
