I always transfer to gdax and move it for free in under 10 min

It’s not missing dude. That’s part of Brian Armstrong’s annual bonus for a job (ughh) well done

This is good. finex and other centralized exchanges need to die to let decentralized exchanges flourish.

I keep telling people... the reason why fees are high temporarily right now is because this is an auction on buying processing power to confirm your transaction and there are a LOT of people bidding on it. That’s a good sign for the future. Longer term it’s a technological problem and transaction fees will come down, just inevitable as scale is reached

Good one!

You are preaching to the choir :)

And one of them is mine. Feels like those early mining days in 2011 all over again. Good times

Is he still alive? Drinking all that coca cola every day

Stop posting the same meme over and over again.
We get it. We don’t have a life and don’t sleep and our significant others do.

Just push him in. That’s how I taught my 4 year old. Now at 6, he does back strokes and freestyles like a champ. You either get it or you don’t.

Why we include Satoshi’s coins in bitcoins cap, why not Ripples total available coins?

Keep in mind Buffet and Munger’s Coca Cola has literally given hundreds of millions diabetes all over the world. But yes let’s talk about rat poison.
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:59:07
Every days a good day to sell fiat and buy bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:41:33
Without those pizzas, Bitcoin wouldn’t have been where it is today. So a worthy sacrifice.
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:36:25
He’s a banking schill and his other companies like Coca Cola and Mars Chocolate literally sell rat poison to give diabetes to millions around the world, so his healthcare companies (DaVita) can prescribe overpriced opioids and diabetes medicines (more rat poison)

Oh it’s that disgraced fascist apologist Goldman Sachs turd who was fired by Trump

I ran for the hill when they dropped coinjoin under regulatory pressure. Really no real reason to use that wallet anymore unless you know of any

What a horrible way to live

Sell fiat, keep bitcorns

I wonder what’s his agenda

Maybe cracking under the pressure of managing Putin’s crypto holdings?
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:47:17
Why would anyone work for the government 
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:42:26
True there are early adopters but today everyone has heard of bitcoin and just as easily sell their fiat and move it to bitcoin to preserve future buying power. That’s the true anti inflationary purpose of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:39:50
My favorite Satoshi
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:08:47
You dont really buy a bitcoin you know. You just buy the right to send a transaction with an output to an address you control (off exchange please). If you keep it on exchange, you are just renting anyways

Coinbase is an enemy of the people

This is not financial advice and spend next 20 minutes shilling the latest shitcoin. Most of the content can be summed up as that. I agree there are gems out there but good luck finding them.

Can use it to play the game: find the one which is not a cryptocurrency

And who would like to police this utopia of yours? SEC? Finra? Bitlicense?
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:11:30
No, we really don’t need to.
