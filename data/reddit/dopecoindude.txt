Good to see.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:36:33
[Dopecoin]( is currently working on a way to solve this and are in talks with a few people . At some point this has to happen .
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:41:32
We'll see right ?
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:57:27
[dopecoin]( to the moon!
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:02:49
lol :)
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:08:46
Hopefully [Dopecoin]( will be mentioned in the movie :)
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:23:56
DopeCoin will be accepted also. /s
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:15:50
Ironically, we are close to getting delisted on [Bittrex]( peeps need to buy some up! lol
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:09:11
About time!
@_date: 2016-01-09 04:24:20

@_date: 2016-02-13 01:28:44
Cool to see this.  Like to get there someday for this.
@_date: 2015-04-20 01:04:50
Depends if the person who sold them wants a refund. Most likely not.
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:35:40
So DOPE! 
@_date: 2015-04-18 06:20:40
right. Or, not coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 04:42:40
Yo brother lets talk! I run [DopeCoin]( love to get a head shop accepting DOPE! and BTC of course :)
edit: also, your add to cart isn't working :(     I'm on chrome.
@_date: 2015-04-20 00:58:33
No. Also, that website is probably a scam.

I know the person who owns xstreamuim.com and streamiumcams lets get some programmers lol
@_date: 2015-10-02 02:47:28
It's all about 
@_date: 2015-10-25 18:59:53
Sucks to see this :(
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:10:07
doesn't work for me. I tried to sell 1 btc and nothing happens.
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:53:54
Hundreds of these have come and gone.
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:34:50
when you are done with it come over to .
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:20:49
We are trying to get there with [DopeCoin]( and can maybe pave the way for Bitcoin also. Everything comes down to just getting the technology in front of people.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:28:43
Not premined.  It provides plenty of benefit. Nope , you wouldn't be able to do a 50 percent attack. Clearly, you don't know anything about coins. Its been around over a year this isn't a fly by night coin. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 21:50:14
Hopefully, they will accept [DopeCoin]( next time ;) 
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:05:31
Get some eBooks/Music at  @_date: 2015-10-13 17:41:38
Hoping to be there ! :)

I got ripped off twice this week from people claiming they could do programming if I give them a downpayment!  Pretty bummed when it happened and almost lost faith!  Not sure if this is a good enough story , but ya that is it. Haha....
Thanks The Bitcoin Angel
I can send screenshots also.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:12:23
I still think all this has to remain local. Like you said, some BTC peeps ( or, other coins ) should be based in CO. I'm thinking a localbitcoins fits nicely , for a OTC weed marketplace. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:51:02
also lol :)
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:13:14
....and from Nigeria.
