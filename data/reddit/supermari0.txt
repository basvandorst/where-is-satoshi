There is no "real" value. Everything is valued and valuation can change quickly (e.g. water during draught).
Both gold coins and paper money require trust that they're still worth something tomorrow. In both cases this can turn out to be not the case. Maybe one is more likely to retain value than the other, but that's about it.

His point is that if you describe to a person from the 90s what 2016 has to offer in terms of CGI capability, he would stand there in utter disbelief.
E.g. show John Carmack right after he released the original DOOM a clip of the most recent one. Then proceed to explain that the game will cost $18 and a computer to play it smoothly around $600 (inflation adjusted).
This has been true for almost every area of technology. E.g. TCP/IP will never be able to handle streaming video, etc.
While I agree with there being a problem relying on optimistic expectations too much, he does have a point. It might very well be possible to handle every coffee transaction on a broadcast network. Maybe not, though. But it's certainly possible to handle todays workload on chain.

No. The "Lightning Network" will be a functional upgrade for bitcoin, like e.g. multisig. No seperate client.
It's essentially: "instead of immediately submitting every little transaction to the blockchain, let's see if we can bunch some transactions together, see what cancels out and only broadcast the end result to the network".
@_date: 2016-08-02 12:14:26


Even with the best possible use of the bandwidth, the current limit puts a severe restriction on bitcoin's potential capacity. Magic doesn't exist.


Mining is centralized because of the computing/electricity cost of hashing, not processing of blocks/transactions. Average Joe is far removed from the current mining game for various reasons -- blocksize has nothing to do with that. Bigger blocks have a negative effect on decentralization but to what degree is hard to say. Mostly because of a bad network connection to chinese mines, which affects big mining operations and average Joes the same.


No DOOM! scenario, but possibly opportunity cost.


"Lightningcoin"? You need to read up on what the lightning network is and what it isn't.


If a new version is better, people will upgrade. Why the seperate blockchain requirement? "go away leave me alone!"?

@_date: 2016-08-24 05:19:13
I really don't understand why people don't get this.
Their vision (as I understand it): A mining chip in almost any (applicable) computing device mining *at a loss* (by design) for the convenience of *automatically*, converting some electricity into "computer money" usable for machine initiated microtransactions, essentially turning those devices into economic actors.
No sign up, no prerequisites like verified identity, bank account or credit card. No user interaction whatsoever. Then, for example, those miniscule amounts of bitcoin could be used to pay for web content and completely replace the ad revenue model (see: Brave browser). User won't really manage their mined bitcoin. They don't buy into this because they want to generate and cash out bitcoin. They'll be happy because suddenly there are no visible paywalls on any website for them. No malware infested ads. No popups. No tracking. Maybe your gaming console suddenly offers free online services again. Maybe netflix will be free for users of a bitcoin-enabled TV.
Sure, you'll pay more in electricity at first but imagine what happens when electricity becomes significantly cheaper when Elon Musk's solar panel plan comes into fruition or some other technology becomes available. The sun bombards us with all the energy we'll ever need at the current rate, so I'm pretty sure energy will be very cheap once we figured out the details of efficiently harnessing, storing, transmitting that energy.
And on top of that, as long as there is some cost invovled and a huge number of "miners" are willing to mine at a loss for convenience, you completely destroy the mining centralization we know today. For profit mining will be next to impossible even for the biggest, chinisiest mines out there.
All of this might very well never work for a myriad of reasons. But it's not a stupid idea (and their vision is probably a bit more fleshed out). It's not stupid to try this or something along those lines. And investors seem to agree.
To get people on board, they built the first prototype of a bitcoin enabled device like that. Purposefully including the mining as core part of the concept. Not as a consumer product, but as a *complete* development kit. An all-in-one package.
@_date: 2016-08-31 10:59:17


Is the probability of non tech savvy people owning a ["Snapdragon 820 64-bit 2.15 GHz quad-core CPU"]( also 0%?


You're looking at this completely wrong. Think of smartphones that feature e.g. ad-free internet experiences. Or access to paywalled content without signup / manual payment process. The fine print then says that this device (or its charger) has a bitcoin mining chip embedded and the specs show the power consumption (which come out to an extra couple of bucks each month compared with a device without a mining chip).
You payment method just changes from e.g. credit cards (with identity and risk of identity theft)  to just electricity. And for the convenience, you willingly pay a small premium.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:51:50
In case it's theirs, then this would apply to ETH and USD as well. Then it's their assets and their liabilities. There would be no reason to not touch ETH or USD deposits.
They'll probably ask their users for a credit and if enough agree, they'll pay off their debts over time. If not, then they'll file for bankruptcy.
@_date: 2016-08-31 20:30:14
1) As I already said, for any of this to work, mining chip development has to stagnate.
2) It's reasonable to expect that it will do exactly that, because mining chips have recently caught up with the state of the art in chip manufacturing. Lifecycles *will* increase. We are simply beginning to hit physical limits.
3) Embedded mining is not for profit mining. You buy bitcoin with electricity at a small premium for the convenience of complete automation. The fact that the chip still generates 1.71 USD worth of bitcoin per month today is impressive, for what that thing is supposed to be at this stage.
My point is simply this: there are a few ideas, concepts, opportunities that if combined and realized/seized correctly, could potentially result in something revolutionary. There are a lot of big ifs and part of it probably comes down to pure chance, but their vision could become a reality. Criticism often completely ignores the fact that there are plausible enough solutions to supposedly insurmountable issues. Only to rant about another made up dead end once this is explained, at some point coming full circle and flat out ignoring previous explanations. And most people defending 21 are not saying this is exactly whats going to happen, we just defend the idea that this is a real possibility.
People are so eager to call out scams and stupid ideas that they lash out at everything they can, hoping to hit a real target. Broken clock and all. It's annoying. You can give an idea credit without automatically just being naive.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:51:34


No. A seperate chain is what defines an altcoin. Upgrades to bitcoin (like LN) are not "altcoins".


Can you actually explain why that's "disrespectful"? You hold a very strange view on those things.
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:47:51
So you can't simply identify illegitimate transactions and not sign them. You need to set up filters and limits. Maybe those settings made the alarm falsely go off too often and bitfinex demanded adjustments to the point where they weren't any use at all.
Maybe there's a backend that enables bitfinex to set those parameters themselves. Maybe the hacker got access to the necessary credentials and changed it himself.
In any case, if bitfinex can show that BitGo is to blame, they will.
If they don't we can assume bitfinex is to blame 100% (BitGo can't just go around and talk about it).

You are unwilling to really consider the possibilities here, so there's no point in continuing this.

I don't think many people are blindly opposing a hardfork and I bet if there's some serious bug that requires a hardfork to fix they come around quite quickly.
is right: if a hardfork is contentious, it's almost guaranteed to split the chain in two for some amount of time. How long depends on the severity of contention.
It's especially dangerous if both factions have valid arguments, which is the case for the blocksize issue IMHO.

I fully agree with Vitalik's point that Craig is choosing the noisy way of proving that he is SN for a possibly obvious reason.
But putting that issue aside for a second -- I find attempts at explaining his motivations as a scammer really weak. What are his reasons for trying to pull this off? What's the angle? Usually people hand wave it away with tax problems, mental illness, boredom, attention whoring, etc. I'd like to see someone really explain Craig as a scam artist to me. Compared to someone making a SN themed twitter account, he is really putting in some effort and does that with his real name, his life.
I (currently) just don't buy it that this guy got up one morning and decided to try to dupe people into thinking he is SN. Why do something so life defining? He must've known that 1-on-1 sessions will simply not be enough when there's a simple way of publicly providing proof of ownership - after all that's what bitcoin is all about. Not that it necessarily proves his identity, but still.
This whole thing doesn't make sense to me as a simple scam attempt.

Wow. Talk about defending a preconceived notion. You're contradicting yourself left and right trying to bend this thing to fit your narrative.
I see this very often. Whenever there's the slightest possibility that people got scammed, they immediately have the urge to declare that they figured it all out and that they're not stupid and wow! isn't it obvious! etc. Possibly to elevate themselves and not risk looking like a "pathetic victim" or something. Wether or not their theories make sense doesn't matter, everything that remotely fits their narrative immediately becomes indisputable fact and everyone arguing against it a co-conspirator. I guess a lot of people just vastly prefer the risk of being wrong about a scam over being perceived as a naive victim in case it really was one.
Think what you want. I don't think I nor anyone can change your mind at this point. You figured it all out. Congratulations, you can't be tricked. Or can you?
We'll see. If I had to bet money I would bet a lot on bitfinex being a (possibly deserved) victim of a hack. Which doesn't mean I'm ruling out other shenanigans, though.

It's also illegal and extremely dangerous for the perpetrator. Why risk it if you have a successful company that's making you money?


So guilty until proven innocent?


Well, maybe that's just how it is? Why do you assume it would be immediately obvious what happened? Hackers usually try to stay undetected and clean up after themselves pretty well. Sorry, I don't think you have an IT security background with an opinion like that.


Again, you seem to be clueless how any of this works. The hacker won't be able to spend any of those coins any time soon. I wouldn't be surprised if the real objective was to short bitcoin and get clean money out of this hack that way.

@_date: 2016-04-14 08:17:27


How small is it? What's your source?


I don't think Satoshi would necessarily be in that group. I think ultimately having internet cash for every coffee in the world and running a node at home are mutually exclusive. LN *might* solve that -- with compromises. But even with LN we'll need much bigger blocks if we want to run a payment network for 7 billion people.


I think this is true. The conspiracy theories are utter bullshit. Core aims to build the most elegant solution, Gavin &amp; co are a bit more pragmatic. I can sympathize with both sides.
There are however a lot more idiots in the big block camp (but that doesn't invalidate the approach).

The technical community is generally fine with up to 4MB of blockdata. Tech growth will probably increase that number a lot in the next 10 years, especially combined with software side improvements (adressing orphaning concerns).
Personally, I think the issue is this: the segwit softfork scheme is very clever, much more so than a simple blocklimit bump (with appropiate safety measures). Software developers like the clever, elegant and best possible solution. Sometimes a less elegant, pragmatic solution is exactly whats needed, because there's more than just the state of the codebase at stake. Also, you might find yourself spending a lot of time and effort on perfecting something that might get rendered obsolete because of some other development. Solving problems no one is experiencing.
On the other hand it's perfectly fine to say that a customer should not dictate technical details of a solution. Yes, we should leave that to the experts. This doesn't work though if you don't trust the developers and feel they're going in the wrong direction with their development. I think this is expressed by the blockstream hate / conspiracy theories.
Big blockers want their pound of flesh, small blockers don't want to give in. But beyond that, I really think everyone here is doing / arguing for what they think is best for bitcoin, but it might just be the case that there are two (perfectly valid) models of what bitcoin should be or become and this chasm manifests itself in endless discussions missing this root of the problem.
"Bitcoin can't handle all the world's coffees." Probably not, but who the fuck knows, really? Experts in the past agreed that packet switched networks couldn't possibly handle the internet as we know it today, but they do. What we do know is that we can at least handle double of what we're handling today with bitcoin. If we can say the same again in two years, we're on a very good track.
As Antonopoulos said: if bitcoin is failing to scale we have one more thing in common with the internet. Try convincing network engineers from '95 that Ultra HD Netflix will be a thing just 20 years later (on *tcp/ip* -- for less than 10 bucks a month.


I don't think you can generally claim that everyone should have known that 1MB is a fixed limit (like the 21M) that will never change. Especially since it's creator stated that it's more or less a temporary anti-spam measure.


Actually, no. I need 95% or 75% of people consenting (depending who you ask). Then the minority can either bite the bullet or keep their small fork running. If we're being honest, it's provably just 51%. You might not want that to be true and it would be very bad if it came down to that (which probably won't happen for game theoretic reasons), but that's just how it works on the lowest level: a simple majority dictates what the longest *valid* chain is. The chance of a permanent fork is highest at an even split, but then that chance decreases exponentially once a majority forms and grows.

They better, because to eradicate an idea like bitcoin (or public, permissionless blockchains in general), you would need an incredible amount of it. Hell, even with all the money in the world I can't see how they'd be able to do more than to slow it down a notch.
If in the end this is going to be sillicon valley vs wall street I'm not concerned. Like, at all.
Things to keep in mind: The amount of influence money has on politics is probably at its peak right now in the US. Citizens United will be overturned eventually. The shitshow that is happening there right now will make sure of that. And even with all that influence it has, politicians want to be (re)elected. That's what they use that money for. If that money alone can't get them there, they will pander to their electorate. And public opinion about wall street isn't really positive. Movies like The Big Short don't help in that regard. Even in that sorry excuse for a democracy, voters still have a voice. And once voters see the benefits of the seperation of state and money, we win.

I'd also guess that there probably *is* a reason for closing your account (maybe a misunderstanding though). You might wanna clear that up with them.
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:29:08
Can you elaborate on that? AFAICT there's still an 1MB constant in [consensus.h](
    /** The maximum allowed size for a block excluding witness data, in bytes (network rule) */
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000;

I don't think thats true. Think of LN as being the default in every bitcoin wallet. Don't assume you'll have to micromanage your channels. Just like you don't have to manage your tcp/ip route to reddit.com.
When the devs talk in their presentations about Alice opening a channel to Bob, I don't think they mean that as a manual user interaction.

Only new nodes have the full data. There is partitioning on some level.
@_date: 2016-04-13 12:41:52
I think the point here is that that both approaches have some level of partioning going on. While a hardfork communicates that clearly and makes a hard cut, SWSF is somewhat safer but also a bit more ambiguous (and sometimes presented disingenuously in that regard).
Note that I'm not picking any sides here.

As long as it's very easy to route around them in case they misbehave, hubs (or simply *very* well connected nodes) aren't really a problem.
So as long as we're able to open up TCP connections to peers on the internet, we're fine.
It's also interesting to think about what a lightning connected exchange would mean: They could in theory stop having custodial ownership of your crypto assets. Some already provide the option of auto converting any deposit you do. With the LN, you don't need to wait for 6 or so confirmations: you press a button on your smartphone and the coins you control are instantly transferred to the exchange and sold at market rate for whatever currency you chose before hand. And in a crypto-to-crypto scenario, I think exchange do not need to take ownership of any funds at any point in time using cross chain atomic swaps. At least that's what I've gathered. I could be wrong with the devil being in the details. We'll see.

I agree. Just wanted to point out that it's correct to say that fundamental benefits of bitcoins are (mostly) lost in that case. (There are still benefits in having an immutable, censorship resistant, fully decentralized system at the bottom, whatever gets built on top...)

AFAICT the use case for LN might be everything except cold storage.


The experts actually developing those technologies seem to disagree with you?
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:43:21
Ehm, no.
If you want to make bitcoin payments reversible (= mutable) you have to introduce counterparty risk (i.e. escrow). That's what I would consider giving up on one of the fundamental benefits of bitcoin. That's fine in many cases, but it is what it is.
As a "second layer" solution you only have some other thing that's mutable (e.g. database entries on coinbase), but you didn't "implement mutability on top of immutability" as that would suggest you've found a way to make bitcoin transactions mutable.
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:06:12
High quality, open source software is coming to disrupt the global payment industry. The people on the receiving end of that $2.2 trillion won't be too happy about that. Some will adapt, embrace the tech and win big. Others will try every trick in the book to stop it and fade into irrelevance.

@_date: 2018-01-10 06:51:18
But whatever "layer" that's build on will be giving up the fundamental benefits of bitcoin (and is arguably not a layer of bitcoin anymore).
For reversals, you'd need to reintroduce counterparty risk.
@_date: 2016-04-13 09:55:11


I seriously don't understand this. Nodes = votes. Bitcoin is democratic in that sense. The majority decides what bitcoin is through adoption. Can we do a poll on the entire ecosystem? No. The best indicator we have is hashpower.


Why 95% and not 100% then? Where is the difference between 95% and 75%? In both cases it's a majority rule with winners and losers. Why not 80%, 85% or 90%?

`0.16.0` ... or maybe `16.0`. IIRC they're changing the versioning scheme.
edit: Looks like the versioning change is scheduled for `17.0.0` (and also not really decided, yet)
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:21:54
But that layer gives up on immutability. By definition.
@_date: 2016-04-14 08:01:24


Can you elaborate on that? From what I understand old nodes do not really validate SegWit transactions because they're made to look like "anyone can spend" transactions to them. Only new nodes validate those properly. So old nodes are not really fully validating(?)
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:22:17
I'm not arguing against escrow here.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:46:25
The versioning change is not supposed to signal any change in quality in this case, though. It's not really going from beta quality to production quality. It's more of an acknowledgement that it has been used in production for quite a while and that a point where there's consensus to call it `1.0.0` (with the associated meaning) might never come.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:58:44
Makes you wonder if the Jaqen Hash’ghars, Jonald Fyookballs, Craig Wrights, Roger Vers, Bitfinexxeds, etc. are all part of the same coordinated effort. Either knowingly or unknowingly.
I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist, but if a powerful group of people have recognized bitcoin as the biggest financial disruption &amp; wealth transfer of the century, then all bets are off.
I mean, we know it's happening on the political landscape with Trump and Brexit, etc.

More difficult and not much benefit right now. Appstores have possibly strict policies on apps like that. Not the right time.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:47:05
But you didn't "implement mutability", you made two immutable transactions :)
In that sense bitcoin is already "mutable" if you squint hard enough: you can always make another transaction that undoes the effects of the previous one.
However that requires both parties to agree. You can't reverse a transaction where one party is unresponsive or unwilling to play along. And you can't implement that on top of bitcoin without handing off control to a third party.

The only thing ridiculous here is that you're taking the analogy literally. The point is it is highly unlikely LN on BCH will happen.
Any developer right now who is capable of writing that code can see bcash for what it is and has no interest in doing so. Plain and simple. Sit back and watch bcash sink into insignificance.

What are you on about? Lightning Network is not Litecoin. However LN also works with Litecoin and can enable cross chain swaps.
It's also not developed by bitcoin core developers. When, where and how they start with lightning is up to the Lightning Network project (or forks thereof as it is MIT licensed open source software).
Also marketing and media coverage is also of little consequence in the long run in case of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:53:08

@_date: 2017-12-31 11:25:58
In principle, absolutely.
But it requires some serious work to adapt it to a coin that's too different from bitcoin. Say bcash which doesn't have SegWit, which the current LN implementations are based upon.
No one capable of doing that work has any interest whatsoever of doing it. One of the reasons that the bcash flippening won't happen. They have a big marketing budget, but bitcoin has the competent engineers.

We'll never know. That metric isn't really applicable for Lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:13:24


Disagreed. I believe many people are buying and holding it because it's a new, uncorrelated asset class. It fulfills the same purpose as gold: a hedge against the current set of fiat currencies that are constantly devalueing and virtually guaranteed to collapse at some point (like hundreds of now dead fiat currencies in the past).
Of course there are some people that are just hyped up and don't really know what they buy into. But smart money is heavily invested, too.


No, because bitcoin is not an IOU. You're comparing apples and oranges. The gold you have a certificate for can be confiscated, lost by or stolen from the custodian.

Democracy is (ideally) just a decision making process through which society decides on the rules and regulations of things like the financial system. In theory, people who disagree are forced into the system most people agree on. In reality most people are forced into a system that a select few agree on [under democratic pretenses](
In cryptocurrency land, an agreement about the predominant ruleset emerges through the number of people voluntarily following a particular ruleset. Ideally, sensible rulesets will attract more people than non-sensical or faulty ones. With the help of the network effect a clear winner then quickly emerges.
Within a network/ruleset, agreement about the current state is achieved through Nakamoto Consensus.
This is the seperation of money and state through the emergence of digital gold and the stuff that's going to be built on top of it.

Bitcoin being risky for holders due to the "new and improved" difficulty adjustment on BCH is the new one.
It's complete bullshit of course. If bitcoin really loses 95% of it's hashrate within a couple days and grinds to a halt, there will simply be an emergency hard fork. I bet it would be VERY easy to get consensus on that, because there's actually a good reason to do it.

From what I understand, the thought was that you can mathematically prove to someone that doesn't own the entire blockchain that those who are building it violated the network rules (as your SPV client understands them).
If you have that, you can more comfortably shift some operations into datacenters. Without that, doing this is a no go. (Because Bitcoin would slowly morph into Paypal with less and less meaningful crypto and hashing sprinkled on top.)

No... they simply don't want to require user interaction. It has nothing to do with how easy or hard it is to acquire and load bitcoin onto a device. *Any* effort required is way too much effort required.

@_date: 2015-12-08 05:44:20
Because acting against the best interest of the network as a whole is a risky business. If there's an concrete problem with the blocksize and miners still don't to react to that and a majority of hashpower becomes malicious this way, the price might react very harshly.
If you own any meaningful amount of hashpower, you're *very* invested in bitcoin and have an incentive to make it work for the majority.
If we don't have concrete issues that could drive miner consensus then there's not really a problem? Then tech growth and software improvements will again increase decentralization over time.

Miners mine for profit, that's not the goal of the devices we're talking about. They trade slightly higher electricity costs for the convenience of not having to deal with the process of acquiring minute amounts of bitcoin manually and managing a wallet for your device(s). No human interaction is necessary as long as there is electricity available. That's the point of this whole thing.

I think you need to differentiate scale from scalability. XT says: while we do need to improve the *scalability* of bitcoin, we can already start increasing its *scale*.

With emphasis on "just", because raising the cap will still be needed at some point.
While the chance of that happening approaches zero, I'd still prefer a cleaner, hardfork implementation of Segregated Witness including Wuille's blocklimit BIP, ideally with an initial bump to 2MB for an effective ~4MB blocksize (SW discount) in the beginning and increasing that by ~17% per year along with tech growth.
Even without an initial bump, I think letting bitcoin grow with the technological improvements happening on multiple levels is a good baseline. In case we overshoot, correct it with a soft work.
I completely agree with the rest.

If he had signed with [this key]( I'd be far more inclined to believe that it's him.
He posts as Satoshi Nakamoto and uses a known email address, so he obviously wants us to think it's him. He could provide a signed message which, while not being 100% proof, would give much more weight to his claim. But he doesn't.
He could also use very early bitcoin addresses to sign messages.

An imaginary one. Looks like Lightning [won't have hubs](
It's not like Ripple today, but along the lines of [original Ripple](
Long story short, Bitcoin is not under any attack by blockstream trying to build an infrastructure to start generating revenue with their secret LN hub business model. Think of LN as an opt-in feature for bitcoin, enabling instant transactions of any size down to a satoshi in a peer-to-peer decentralized way scalable to hundreds of millions of users with relatively small blocks.

A net loss from a pure bitcoin miner's perspective.
Future "miners" might want to mine at a loss because mining is a convenient way to get small amounts of bitcoin without requiring registration, a bank account, KYC/AML or time even. So convenience might be a reason. Pay with electricity.
This assumes a good use case for very small amounts of bitcoin, e.g. "Get ad free internet on this device!" (= some HTTP requests are paid for with miniscule amounts of bitcoin automatically in the background)

It's not really important until one of two things are the case: a) we start to rely on fees to keep the network secure or 2) blocks are too small for the number of transactions.

I did, and I got the context. You should probably read the bitcoin-development mailing list. A bitcoin version with a 20MB blocksize limit will be voted in by miners who adopt it.
To quote hearn: "The approach is the same for other forks. Voting via block versions and then when there's been &gt;X% for Y time units the 1mb limit is lifted/replaced."

Bitcoin's anchor is it's decentralization. No one is in control. It is a completely neutral, moral free, uncensored, unhackable, transnational way of exchanging value.
If the technology gets to a point where you can (automatically) pay for an ad-free page view of some website for fractions of a cent, as well as pay for your house with it, it's not going to be *a* form of money, it's going to be *the* form of money... and the foundation for many things beyond.

We already agree that hardforks can't be done overnight. How about in six months? How about 4MB?
8MB would require at least ~110 kbit/s upstream. That could very well prevent a small minority of people from running bitcoin fullnodes at home. But this is node a huge barrier of entry and is circumvented by buying a $15/mo VPS... until you can upgrade your connection at home.
Is there a minimum requirement for bitcoin anyway? What's the target group? Is the Raspberry Pi a standard measure of bitcoin decentralization?
@_date: 2015-06-01 05:55:34
Why would the limit change reduce bitcoin to a network of datacenter nodes?
1. Regarding the number of fully validating nodes: It's argued that along with block size increases in the past, the number of full nodes shrunk as well. **Correlation does not imply causation.** I bet the popularity of the easier to use webwallets / SPV clients have something to do with that. I used armory in the past for my coins, I now use trezor.
2. **It's a hard limit, not a guaranteed block size.** Miners still generally do not even produce 1MB blocks. It seems to grow with usage, which now starts bumping against that 1MB limit.
3. The rig that you use to process those &lt;1MB blocks is probably already powerful enough to handle &lt;20MB blocks. **There is no sudden need to upgrade to a 20x more powerful hosting package or computer.**
4. Even if it really does result in more centralization and the requirement of data center hosted server racks: For how long? **Processing power and bandwidth get cheaper every month.** It would take 7-8 years (according to [Nielsen's Law]( for 20MB to become equivalent to what 1MB is today. One might argue to start that comparison in 2010, when the 1MB limit was introduced.

You misunderstood. My point was that usually, the advice not to re-use an address, is brought up for *privacy* reasons, not *security*.

@_date: 2015-12-22 10:06:20


Maybe "definitely not" is a bit strong, but is it likely to get any easier if adoption increases significantly?


They don't control bitcoin, because at the end of the day they're employed by the network's users (and can be fired if push comes to shove).
But for a clean execution of a hard fork, they're not irrelevant?!


I agree with the first part. But decentralization is not a boolean and 2/4/8MB wouldn't set it from true to false even if it were.


But it doesn't have to be a process of 1.5 years, either. Not today.

True, but then the subreddit name is essentially held hostage by a small group of people promoting their own bitcoin related values. It's hard to get away from it's network effect, saying "go somewhere else" ignores this and while it's true that you can and should exit if your voice isn't heard, it takes time to change the course and build up a mainstream alternative and there's damage being done in the meanwhile.

To add to that, I really don't believe it's true when people say that the next halving (and by that logic every halving after that) "is already priced in".
A lot of people *owning* bitcoin don't know many of the details. Yes, technically it's all out in the open, but that doesn't mean that everybody knows about it. If you're subscribed here, ofc you know. If you read BCT, yes, you're in the loop. But not that many people are or do respectively.
As long as bitcoin keeps working and as long as no other cryptocurrency is able to overcome its network effect, the price *will* rise. Expect spikes around halvings.

Value is never intrinsic, you always need context.

I was happily following the discussion and was very disappointed to see that point disregarded in this manner.
We are effectively reducing the blocksize limit all the time by not adjusting the numerical value of it to the availability of more and cheaper bandwidth. Do you not agree?
With all the improvements that happened to core (thanks to you and the other devs) since Satoshi introduced the limit combined with the developments in networking and computing, how can a 8MB **hard limit** be too much to handle at this point? Well not even really at *this* point, but in another 6+ months from now at the earliest. And only if 75% of miners agree they CAN in fact handle that limit (which is still not the actual block size to handle). Oh and how is there an immediate 75%/25% fork if there's a grace period of another two weeks AFTER the 75% agree.
The author fears to be on the wrong side of such a fork in the future, but well... he simply *is* on the wrong side of it then. With 75% explicitly in favor there are bound to be a lot of don't cares / undecideds and then some number of opponents. Well, the majority disagrees with you what bitcoins capabilities/properties ought to be, so yes, you are on the wrong side and you can either concede and adopt these changes or build an altcoin, like people right now already try and do.
Being on the wrong side of an upcoming fork doesn't lose you your money, being stubborn about it does.

They actually do support a limit increase, but not immediately to 20MB. Chun Wang from F2Pool suggested to start with 2MB and double it every one or two years and later agreed with anything under 10MB in the first two years.

I believe the bitcoin-core code just defines the numerical threshold for dust (which isn't relayed). That's quite different from *your* written definition, based on *your* observations.
Also, said threshold was 0.01BTC at some point in the past, because transactions below that threshold didn't have any economic significance with the price at the time and could bloat the blockchain without good reason. But if these transactions *do* have utility, I don't see why they should be demonized. Many people talk about bitcoin-the-currency being only the most obvious first application of the (bitcoin-)blockchain, not the only one.
There's a lot of personal opinion in your replies and you're entitled to that. But don't act like you know what bitcoin users [want or don't want to do](

Nielsen's law is defined by one guy upgrading his internet connection whenever feasible and plotting that data. It's an indicator of whats available to powerusers and the 50% per year increase fits his data from 1983 to 2014.
IMHO "powerusers" are a better fit than "average households" for people wanting to run bitcoin fullnodes, but I'd agree that doubling every two years is a little bit too optimistic.

Double spending will only ever be a problem when it's done on a scale larger than current credit card fraud. Until then zero-conf may be acceptable to a lot of merchants if it enables a kind of payment that's cheaper than other methods (all things considered).

It's not either SW or blocklimit increase, though. SW should and will be implemented either way (hopfully cleanly in a hardfork and not hacked in as a softfork).


No. At the very least you need to be able to upload a block to another peer within a 10minute timeframe to be effectively a relaying node. Of course, this isn't ideal, but it's the minimum. If you want to upload to 8 peers in parallel within 30seconds, then yes, you need a 16.3mbit/s connection.


Well I didn't build the machine at home myself either. I didn't check the whole software stack line-by-line. And I won't be surveilling the machine 24/7. At some point you kinda sorta need to let go of that 100% security fantasy and realize that some things are just good enough. If you're still paranoid you can buy a couple of nodes at different sites.... or start building your own chip fab.


So in that post you say that ideally everyone on earth should be able to run a fullnode. I assume you mean in this context that every person should be able to afford the hardware required to run one. But in a world where everyone can run bitcoin, no one can use it, because it's capacity is too limited. You will always, regardless of how much the tech can realistically improve, have to price some people out of their home-run fullnode.

Don't forget that there is *at least* a six months lead time to any block size limit increase.
Also the fact that bitcoin currently only supports ~3tps could be a problem in itself and hinder adoption. It would send a pretty strong message to potential investors and the rest of the world if bitcoin shows that it's able to support PayPal-level transaction volumes by simply changing one line of code.

No one is raising the block size to gigabytes any time soon. The block size **limit** is raised and the network won't/can't continuously produce blocks larger than it can handle under normal conditions (= when it's not under attack). And even with BIP101 we won't get to a gigabyte limit for the next ~15 years.

The system disincentivizes hubs (= nodes with a lot of open payment channels), because if you have a lot of channels open you have a lot of funds locked up. A hub would need to start charging a fee for keeping the channel open. That's a decentralizing force.
Collapsing channels is simply doing a transaction on the blockchain, so the cost of that is just a transaction fee(?)

Miners are always free not to include any transaction they don't want... for whatever reason.
The point is that at this stage, miners shouldn't be forced to pick and choose transactions because an artificial limit prevents them from including all the transactions they want to include. There is no reason to do so. The centralization / no. of nodes argument is bogus if we are talking about increasing it just a couple of megabytes (e.g. 8MB, which Gavin said he would also be fine with). And even if it was an issue, it would become less of one every year as Moore's and Nielsen's laws do their thing.

You essentially repeated what I said :P
There are ( Fullnodes, Users, Merchants, Service Providers ) and ( Miners ). Miners vote directly in the blocks they produce. The rest cannot vote directly on the blocks, but their voice matters nontheless (as I said). People can choose which miners (and protocol versions) they follow.
My point was that fullnodes have no special power compared to the rest of the ecosystem in this regard. You previously claimed: "If you aren't running a **full node**, your opinion on hardforks is completely irrelevant.". This is *NOT* true, as you just said yourself.

The Lightning Network as I understand it (correct me if I'm wrong):
You don't have to repeatedly open and close channels for every coffee you want to buy. It's more like the first time you want to do a LN transaction, you open a channel to whoever you want to transact with. You "fund" that channel with some bitcoin, preferably more than you want to spend right now... let's say all the bitcoin you want to use for day-to-day spending. These are now your instant, point-of-sale lightning fast bitcoins (as opposed to the bitcoins in your savings cold wallet). You then buy your coffee without having to wait for a confirmation or requiring the barista to accept a bitcoin zero-conf transaction. After the sale, the channel stays open. A while later you need to pay for dinner. You can simply pay through that channel you opened before, because the lightning network routes your payment to the node in the restaurant: me -&gt; coffee shop -&gt; a few hops -&gt; restaurant.
As long as everybody agrees and is happy, we can keep our channels open and don't need a blockchain for consensus. If at any point someone tries to cheat, I can close the channel, publish the transaction and point to the blockchain. My funds are safe.
So the blockchain is only used for settlements in some regular intervals or if someone tries to scam anyone. Only the endresult of a channel gets recorded in the blockchain, all the transactions in between are skipped. Meaning the "tps" metric goes through the roof.

The current SW proposal does not include a hardforked block limit increase. Wuille only aluded to a future increase on his last slide.
And the effective capacity increase is far from being equivalent to a 4MB block limit increase. Best case is 2.5MB block limit equivalent assuming 100% SW adoption.


Sure, but I wasn't talking about average nodes. I was talking about the minimum to be any use at all. Beyond that, you can also be a parasite and only download blocks for verification. Or start broadcasting them [on another medium](

Why are we talking about a fee market while block subsidy is still at 25 BTC? And to make up for the upcoming halving you'd have to increase fees by what? 50x? Possibly a lot more since there would be far less transactions at that rate. And a lot less users, meaning far less sacred decentralization.

Again, as many people familar with these processes pointed out, it's highly unlikely that we'll get a decision before the final deadline in Feb 2019. So chance of approval before EOY 2018 is virtually zero.
Chance of approval in 2019 is better, but not good. The SEC doesn't care about how they're seen by conspiracy theorists if they can argue their position. Which will be easy if most of the reasons they gave for declining the ETFs in the past are still valid then.
People who know how these things work give it a low chance of success. Higher than the previous ones, but still low.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:59:18




That's the same argument. It does, theoretically, increase centralization. But a) probably not in any significant amount and b) only temporarily at best, since hardware and bandwidth gets cheaper every month. Moore and Nielsen provide a safety net. If you want more decentralization, make room for more people.


Some of these solutions also require a higher blocksize limit in the long run (e.g. lightning network).


So how high is that risk, realistically? Gavin seems to have support from a lot of big players already. Also you could make it so that the change only takes effect when a supermajority of nodes have upgraded to the correct version, effectively eliminating the risk of a fork.


Consensus among bitcoin developers or the network? Also, the same goes for 10m, 5m or doing nothing. Maybe kicking the can down the road and buying some time to build a more elaborate solution is actually not really that bad.


The risks of telling investors that we're stuck with 3tps for the forseeable future might be too.

This observation is irrelevant. If you pursue technology and upgrade whenever possible, your connection speed doubles every 21 months (*on average*). This has been true since 1983. Of course some people are behind that curve at the moment while some are ahead.


Theres no difference between people running fullnodes, users, merchants and other service providers. Your opinion matters, but only indirectly. Currently, only a miner's opinion is relevant, since they are the ones getting to cast their vote by putting it in a block.

Why would the limit change reduce bitcoin to a network of datacenter nodes?
1. Regarding the number of fully validating nodes: It's argued that along with block size increases in the past, the number of full nodes shrunk as well. **Correlation does not imply causation.** I bet the popularity of the easier to use webwallets / SPV clients have something to do with that. I used armory in the past for my coins, I now use trezor.
2. **It's a hard limit, not a guaranteed block size.** Miners still generally do not even produce 1MB blocks. It seems to grow with usage, which now starts bumping against that 1MB limit.
3. The rig that you use to process those &lt;1MB blocks is probably already powerful enough to handle &lt;20MB blocks. **There is no sudden need to upgrade to a 20x more powerful hosting package or computer.**
4. Even if it really does result in more centralization and the requirement of data center hosted server racks: For how long? **Processing power and bandwidth get cheaper every month.** It would take 7-8 years (according to [Nielsen's Law]( for 20MB to become equivalent to what 1MB is today. One might argue to start that comparison in 2010, when the 1MB limit was introduced.

As for the energy use, it's IMHO very likely that PoW is a fundamental requirement for a value token. A required tether to the real world; to real cost. Perhaps as fundamental as the laws of thermodynamics.

And considering they're running &gt;50% of the bitcoin network's hashrate, it'd be challenging for them to stay anonymous.

And yet they do.
I didn't expect a drop like the one after $1200 in Dec '13. I didn't expect that bitcoin would go through the exact same motions again. It was five years later and so much had changed. Well, here we are. Same shit, different level.
I think these spikes will gradually become less extreme percentage-wise. But the next bubble will pop again. Price will crash. Recover some. Crash again. Consolidate. Some sideways action. Then off to the next one.

So there's some precedence that bitcoiners don't do that kind of thing (e.g. MtGox) and that it's a bad idea in general. Because even though ETH seems to have won out over ETC, that incident exposed a hypocrisy that questions the whole premise of ETH. (But alas, ETHheads are primarily stoked about building something that successfully compiles and kind of works using a shiny new framework... and less concerned with the what and why.)
However if BCorp (coined it!) happens, we will yearn for the days where we only had to deal with people like Ver and stuff like BCash.

This never crossed my mind and seems like a plausible scenario. What would've happened in the UASF/SegWit2x stand off if a lot of people could've recovered severe losses with SW2X successfully going through? Do we think people invested in this space are generally principled enough to stomach, let's say a $200k loss? Or any life-changing amount?
What if SW2X hadn't been pushed by just a couple of people with a few small bitcoin companies under their belt, but by many, far more influential people and orders of magnitude more money involved?

Yeah, that's the reason why nobody ever bought Laptops, Tablets, Smartphones or PCs. The Problem was that there was always a better and cheaper model around the corner. So people waited and waited and waited for increasingly better deals and never bought that gadget. So that never took off.
Thanks to bitcoin, people soon will stop buying cars or houses, because why would they, if they can save so much money by waiting indefinitely. It's literally life threatening: If food prices constantly decrease, people will starve to death trying to save money.

Centralization of hashrate essentially means a few people could act against their own self interest and developers/users would have to respond.
It's also less robust in the sense that a single mine shutting down could lead to higher confirmation times for a while.

Fee markets and fees themselves should probably only become a topic once we see the hashrate start to drop. For the coming years I'd say the block reward is enough to secure the network. Maybe something will replace proof of work and we won't even need fees when the subsidy effectively ends. Who knows.
Right now however we're bumping against a hardcoded, hacked-in limit which was not put there with a fee market in mind.

So you did that cost benefit analysis? And why exactly do you assume they didn't look at this stuff in depth? Heck, they're paid $100,000 a month, it's reasonable to assume they did. Unless you're already convinced it's all just a scam, of course.
And, altough I didnt look at it in depth, I'm pretty sure stuff like threaded posts and hierarchical tags instead of categories are very hard to do as an SMF plugin.


OK let's clear that up. I said due to the technologies they use, the new software will be a whole lot faster / more scalable than any php+mysql software one can dream up. Very fast responses are always incredibly important, even a few milliseconds have a direct impact on the traffic you'll get. This is especially true and measurable on a very large scale, google did some tests on that. And while bitcointalk is currently very responsive and nowhere near google or reddit traffic, at peak times you already get longer load times and a few error pages. Being technically prepared for, and quickly able to react to an influx of new users and a sharp increase in traffic is a good thing. That's especially important in bitcoinland, IMHO.
You said: 


Which is to my point that the new choice of technology will be an improvement over the current one.
Generally speaking, relational databases like mysql scale vertically (powerful servers), while non-relational databases scale horizontally (more machines). Especially if eventual consistency is good enough (which it absolutely is in this case), you can literally almost double your capacity by adding another machine. With relational databases it's not that easy. While server farms are of course possible as well, you don't get twice the capacity when doubling the amount of servers. Sites like reddit are impossible to do this way. I know, bitcointalk will never even come close to such traffic volume, but it's all the same, just on a smaller scale traffic/hardware wise.


I was about to concede it's not really a problem *today*, but even that's not true. As I said during peaks (like a price rally like the one late last year), you'll see hiccups. Also, they had to put a lot of throttling in there to keep it running at the current level. Try searching a few times in a row, it's incredibly rate-limited.
I'm saying with the new software scalability should be far less of a problem, regardless of how fast the site may grow. When one server alone doesn't cut it anymore, the current system will get very expensive, very fast.
Also if you start adding functionality that the SMF architecture really isn't prepared for very well, performance suffers a lot.

Is mbtc **m**illi- or **m**icrobitcoin? Oh right microbitcoin has a "u" for some reason... well not a "u", it's a "μ" but I had to google microbitcoin and then copy/paste that symbol, because although I know how to input ASCII codes, I just can't remember the one for μ.
Anyways, where was I? A yes, I wanted to buy that thing for 900 μBTC (I'm in the future, so that's a lot!). Got it, sweet! Let's see what else is there. Oh I totally need this thing right here for 1.500 μBTC. One point five? Can't be that cheap! Oh wait it's an european website, so that's actually 1,500 μBTC. Shouldn't that be shown as 1.5 or in this case 1,5 mBTC? Oh well, they probably don't want to mix units on their page there. Fair enough, let's buy some more stuff. Great. Done. Grandtotal: 14,975.00 μBTC. Let's check my wallet: 149.1 mBTC. Ah, shoot! Almost enough -- no wait, my bad, I have plenty! Yay!
μBTC / SI Prefixes are correct, but the more simple and uniform approach of "bits" is the right choice. Sure, we'll have high numbers for a while but if bitcoin is to succeed, that's only temporary. If bitcoin fails then... who cares anyway.

But they do not have commit access to the bitcoin repository. If bitcoin is under attack and push comes to shove, it's perfectly legitimate to blacklist people that misbehave intentionally. As long as the majority of users (not hashing power) agrees, they can be shut out of the network.

It has been six days since the thread you mentioned was posted here and we are talking about recompiling the mining software on 286 miners here.

What's worrying is the possibility of them (irrationally) abusing the control we grant them, which would require developers and users to respond and deal with that. It's easier when there's no entity even in a position to theoretically attack the network.
Also just from the perspective of misconceptions about chinese miners controlling your bitcoin, it'd be better if hashrate was more distributed. :)
There's also the possibility of a datacenter containing a lot of hashrate suddenly shutting down and causing significantly slower confirmations for a while. A more distributed mining landscape is certainly better.

I still don't see any fraud. You just have a different opinion on how to handle it. But that's just that: an opinion. What if other donors agree with him? What if the majority does? And does it really matter as long as he provably doesn't misuse those funds? Maybe his strategy is a little more long-term (which seems to be working fine, since all those donations are worth way more today as they were a year ago).
I really don't think you have any case whatsoever here. Especially if he is, as he says, in talks with a software engineering firm.
Maybe things are just moving a little slower than you expected? I think it's a good choice to be a bit more conservative with donations and not just throw that money around while listening to hundreds of different opinions on what to do next with it.
And maybe some of your anger is fueled by the fact that you retrospectively donated way more than you would have if you knew how the price would develop? The "give me back my BTC and I forget all about it" in your OP definitely gives off that vibe.

Because of bitcoinbuilder etc. Maybe they really are trying to protect customers that sell their bitcoins for a fraction of their current value, because of all this FUD.
Then again, why let it go that far in the first place?
My guess is that something bad DID happen, but it's probably not nearly as bad as the rumors suggest. Some coins were lost, possibly due to the malleability issue and Gox re-issuing transactions when it shouldn't have.

But for how long will we have to deal with numbers that high? IMHO bitcoin is either boom or bust. If it's successful, it will be *really fucking* successful. People were called crazy when they suggested parity with the dollar as a possibility and we all know how that turned out. But go ahead, call me crazy when I say 1 bit = $1 is a possibility. Let's prepare for that now, while the iron is hot.
Oh and I don't oppose using "9k" or "1.7m", like it's used with the dollar today.

@_date: 2014-11-10 07:15:30
Yes, I do! But I don't say it that way.
And it's more than likely no one will ever need to talk about billions again, when buying two large pizzas.
If/when bitcoin retests past highs, we may already be in a four digit range with "bits" for a meal like mine. And if we have another spike in price a year after that, even you must admit that BTC won't be viable as a denomination. The move to "bits" is the expression of that concern.
I truly believe it's all or nothing with bitcoin. If you think it'll fail, the bits vs bitcoins debate is meaningless to you. If you think it'll succeed, then you'll need bits or μBTC eventually anyway and you might as well strike while the iron is hot.

My point is that it's too risky to provide a payment service like that. Such a service would take reversible transactions and forward those irreversibly to the shop owner. If stolen CC info was used and Mastercard/Visa decides to reverse the transaction you're shit out of luck. And that can happen months after the payment.
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:40:13
Non-tech people mostly don't use bitcoin yet, anyway. Drop the notion of bitcoins alltogether and use "bits" everywhere. Have a wikipedia article about the "bitcoin" unit for completeness and that's that.
Also, if you don't want to drop "bitcoin" completely -- if wallets offer "bitcoin" and "bits" for you to choose from, it's pretty clear that there is a difference.
@_date: 2014-02-05 07:07:11
There are also years of development behind the SMF software that is used now, yet you want to move away from that.
Sure you can hire "a few PHP developers" and "a couple of designers", but I don't think that would accomplish the same as hiring an experienced software development firm. Maybe it's a bit more than just the same forum with fresh paint on top of different technology... Let's postpone our judgement until we know what the cash was spent for.

Not true, at all.
e.g. $100 from United States to South Africa: $12 with credit card, or $10 with bank account (but 2-3 days delay). You also have to take a bad WU exchange rate into account. 1 USD = 11.00 ZAR (google), 1 USD = 10.81 ZAR (WU).
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:43:00


a more likeley outcome would be a myriad of opinions why said analysis is BS and theymos a scammer :P


care to point to one (open source) example?


True, but they also will never have the same amount of hardware at their disposal. So you have the same scalability problems -- at a slightly smaller scale :)
And while facebook had the money to develop an entirely new database software for it's needs (cassandra), theymos uses "his" money to use a combination of existing and better suited technologies to built a new forum software, matching the needs of bitcointalk, as he sees it. Invest in software -&gt; reduce operating costs.


but not nearly as efficient as nosql solutions do. nosql has it's drawbacks, but I don't think any of those are a problem for a forum software, which makes it a good fit.


if you don't use a relational database the right way -- why use it at all if there are better tools for the job.


but only because they started this way and didn't have the chance/time to start from scratch. I bet the reddit (and facebook) guys would do things quite differently if they could do it all over again. it's a luxury theymos now has, thanks to being conservative with the funds while the bitcoin price was rising.
a month ago reddit had 16 postgreSQL servers, but that probably only worked because there were over 70 memcache instances running in front of that.


In the end, that's just theymos' call. That was the deal everyone who donated agreed to.

real life confusion between computing bits and currency bits is almost impossible.
bit has also been used in a money context before: 
It's really really simple: drop "bitcoin" for the currency alltogether and switch completely to bits. Everywhere. Trying to make xibs, zibs, mikes or cubits happen is a complete waste of time at this point. And anyone thinking μBTC (or better yet "μ฿") called "mi-cro-bit-coin" will ever go mainstream is delusional.
we can either go from bitcoin to millibitcoin ("because it feels more natural right now"), then to microbitcoin after the next one or two spikes only to have people shorten them first to microbits and finally to bits anyway.
... or switch directly from bitcoin to bits... now, while the bitcoin community is still small.

Regarding the rest: not exactly sure how to parse this as a response to my reply.
Does my question not make that much sense or the one I was replying to?
Because my point is that the LN is without any question a huge improvement over the status quo. It enables new use cases and scales the network by a factor X. Wether that ultimately results in enough capacity for 5 million or 5 billion users remains to be seen. In any case, it will most certainly be one of many tools/measures to scale up the network.

A bitcoin that is not vulnerable to a 51% attack would also not be vulnerable to a 75%, 90% or 100% attack.
Also, there would never be only one mining pool with 100%, because that would be too risky for miners in terms of service outages. (The exception probably being P2POOL.)
And no, nothing is currently fixed. A rogue employee at ghash.io can fuck shit up if they are &gt;51% again.

Sorry I meant, if you dump them on an exchange, the price on that exchange would go down (which would subsequently drag the price down on other exchanges, too).

some of those "needed new features" are not easily implemented in existing products


php+mysql is not exactly a "newer programming toy". Using a database like leveldb makes sense in this case and increases scalability significantly.

Bitcoin will kill banks in their current incarnation. There will always be a need for insured safekeeping of funds, among other things. But if people can choose between a bank that publishes a verifiable proof-of-reserves and one that doesn't, I would hazard a guess as to which model will survive and which won't.
Bitcoin and banks are not mutually exclusive, but banks will have to adapt (if bitcoin continues to be successful).

Consumer protection only if your credit card info gets stolen, though. You know... the info that is stored on the computer systems of almost every merchant you deal with. And all other disputes with the merchant are your own problem.
So keep double checking the bills you get from Mastercard, because that consumer protection only triggers on request within a certain timeframe after the transaction.

The balance of an address is not stored in the blockchain as one numeric value, no and I know that. That would be redundant, because you can "read it off of the blockchain" by adding all the unspent outputs that went to an address. Or you can literally read it off blockchain(.info) :P You are pretty nitpicky here.
So explain to me, why do bitcoin experts (e.g. our beloved andreas), peridocally move all their bitcoins from one cold storage paper wallet to a new one? And why is it so hard to believe that a company in japan led by a frenchman might call that process colloquially "checking the balance".
And even doing all that completely offline makes it in a way "less cold", especially when it's suggested that the MtGox fiasco involved a physical security breach.

    The second double-spends that transaction with a transaction with higher fees, paying only
    the change address. In addition you can optionally specify that the first transaction additional OP-
    RETURN, multisig, and "blacklisted" address outputs. Some miners won't accept transactions with
    these output types; those miners will accept the second double-spend transaction, helping you

"it's just right" is not my argument, I just didn't get into the details there.
You argue for SI prefixes, so you're talking about mBTC / millibitcoin and μBTC / microbitcoin. You say let's use whatever reflects the current value best (that's the purpose of SI prefixes). So we'll switch between BTC, mBTC and μBTC all the time. So do we say 0.5 mBTC or 5000 μBTC? Some people will do the former, some the latter. The danger is that you constantly will have to convert between prefixes. Maybe it's easy for you to do so, but a lot of people will have problems with this. At the very least it will increase the chance of making a mistake. For what benefit, exactly?
Then theres the name.... mil-li bit-coins.... four syllables.... people will shorten that. So we'll be talking about millibits and microbits (which is not technically correct because the base unit should be bitcoin). When/if we drop millibits alltogether, because bitcoin is brainfuckingly successful and 90% is denominated in "μBTC", I bet that those microbits will be shortened to "bits" anyway.
Also, no one knows how to write "μBTC" (or better yet: "μ฿"... yeah not initimidating at all for newbies). And again: using "uBTC" is also not technically correct anymore (the thing that you seem to value with SI prefixes). And a 'u' as a prefix for micro is not at all intuitive. Also "mBTC" is somewhat ambiguous between milli and micro...
So why don't we just switch once (while the community is small) and go directly to "bits"? And only "bits".
bits = the currency.
Bitcoin = the technology. (And formerly the name for 1 million bits)
We want Bitcoin to be adopted, used widely, become mainstream. Ask a marketing person what he thinks about this debate, which to be honest is not really a debate anymore, anyway.

No instructions at all on the paper? I'd guess you'll have to visit some website and claim your bitcoin. But this has nothing to do with bitcoin itself, only the terminal company and whatever weird way they chose to dispense BTC.

SMF is PHP, too. By your definition he's a moron, not an expert :P
PHP has a lot of problems, but you can write good software with it. It just happens that because it is very simple to get started with and there are a lot of cheap hosting services for it, a lot of inexperienced/bad developers use it, too.

Not at all. I mean it is, in the sense that there's no key for it on the keyboard, but that's not the sole reason why I think "bits" is a better solution in the real world.
I still don't see how SI prefixes have any advantages over using just one name/symbol for everything, except being academically correct. No country in the world uses SI prefixes for currency this way afaik. Sure you say "100k" and "20 cents" but you don't really say 100 kilodollars... or centidollars... or megadollars... In the end, if bitcoin is to be sucessful, it will be bits anyway even if we take the detour you propose. People will hopefully be using "uBTC" 90% of the time at some point and then, "microbitcoins" will be shortened to either "micros" or "bits"... I'd say the latter is far more likely.
@_date: 2014-02-05 05:29:25
Then why the "request for information" thread here?
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:16:45
~~It's legit.~~ You can check yourself (if you have a gox account) by searching the mtgox_balances file for the date of your last login (check your emails). You have to adjust it to GMT though, I suggest searching for mm:ss and narrow it down.
Then see if the balance is correct.
edit: It probably is legit, but I actually confused two columns and the balance reported isn't correct for me (should be 0, is &gt;0)
edit2: silly me... only accounts with balance &gt; 0 are shown, so my account was never in the file... just found someone else's, whose last login happens to be the same as mine.

I think that's the plan, but it doesn't really matter. It's not at all questionable either way.


That's exactly what he is doing. In part from donations that increased in value substantially thanks to his conservative use of those funds (which he was critizied for in the past). This whole criticism is just so stupid, misguided and fueled by anger from a few people who donated some btc, didn't expect the meteoric rise of it's value and are now bitter about their unintended high contributions. About a year ago the spiel was "I demand you do this or that now (which I know you won't do), or give me my donation back (which is what I really want)."

What we have today: I visit some site with an interesting article. Right now I either get bombarded with ads, harrassed to disable adblock or asked to sign up, tweet, retweet, share, like or +1 the article or straight up pay for it, which requires entering my credit card info. All this for every site, individually.
What this enables: I set up my browser wallet once with some petty cash. I visit some site with an interesting article. I click on a paywalled link. A dialog appears:
    blabla.com requested a payment of $0.50 for accessing this content.
    
    [Confirm] [Cancel]
    [ ] Allow Zero-Click Payments for blabla.com in the future.
If you enable zero-click payments you can specifiy a predefined or custom ruleset for spending limits. With global limits, per-site limits, per-request limits, time constraints, whatever...
Makes you wonder why no one has done this before... nothing in this proposal requires bitcoin specifically. Maybe the difference could be that before, all these sites and companies would have had to commit to a service provider for this. With bitcoin, they'd only need to commit to an open source technology.

I didn't know who Thermos/Theymos was until I heard of the donation drama on this subreddit. I read the accusations and his responses, applied some critical thinking and here I am.
From what I've read, the people criticizing him have a lot of different opinions and assume a lot of things that fit their narrative. You people see what you want to see. Your immediate assumption that Theymos is my BFF, because I disagree with you proves my point.
Then there's the obvious anger involved. I have my theory why this is bothering you so much and I don't think it has anything to do with Theymos or his decisions.
I don't know much about the hacks, so I can't really comment on that. What I know is that Bitcointalk is a juicy target for hackers and no software is ever 100% secure. Maybe a SMF update (if there was a relevant one) would have prevented those attacks, maybe they just would have found another way in. Btw, what makes you so sure that those thousands of forums do not get hacked? Most of them aren't as interesting as bitcointalk to hackers, so there's one reason, but other than that?

With every framework, you can get creative and do things not exactly how they are supposed to be done. The argument that PHP is bad, because you can do things in a shitty way is not a particularly strong one, IMHO.

    They push the human race forward.
    And while some may see them as the crazy ones,
    We see genius.
    Because the people who are crazy enough to think

No, but nothing has. Bitcoin has utility, which is generally valued by people. Most of the world doesn't see this yet, but people will, eventually. Why? Because it's all there in the open... waiting. People need time to wrap their head around it and bitcoin needs time to further evolve.

I haven't tried to double spend, so no. As to people I know: see above. People I personally know? None, but I only know two other bitcoin users personally. What's your point?

@_date: 2014-03-01 17:13:06
I don't think anyone "trusts" him at this point. Some of just acknowledge that we don't have all the facts yet. Are the coins stolen, permanently lost or maybe just temporarily inaccessible? Are all those 850k+ coins affected, or just some? etc...
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:56:37
Not at all. Bitcoin is utterly undervalued because of fear, uncertainty and doubt.
Ultimately you can't do what Changetip does within the current system. The tipping itself could be done by e.g. Paypal, yes. But as soon as you want to withdraw or deposit the difference becomes clear.
People hate the analogy by now, but it's like saying stuff like "email can be replicated with the existing fax technology/network" or "audio-/videostreams are nothing more than broadcast tv/radio" 20 years ago. In a way yes, but fuck no!
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:17:26


Double-spending in this case doesn't give you free money, but it's possible to get goods for free this way. This requires a merchant that accepts zero-conf transactions and delivers immediately (e.g. digital goods). You won't find many of those exactly because double-spending is a very real possibility.
Also, please realize that I was only responding to the claim that "Double spend attacks are hard", which is simply not true for zero-conf transactions.

There is no mechanism needed. All we need is people realizing what the technology, as it exists now, enables. Even if that's only the "store of value" aspect.
Bitcoin is just not yet broadly understood and especially not trusted. But I really don't think we need to do anything in particular to make bitcoin a disruptive success (except develop the software further especially in regards to scalability). It exists and has the properties it has. The missing ingredient is mostly time.

I don't have a problem with the mere theoretical possibility of a 51% attack, as long as it doesn't make any sense economically.
That doesn't mean it's ok to have someone in a position to execute such an attack. So these large pools have to go, but not by pleading to miners. This needs to be enforced by the protocol in some way. At the very least, we can't have any benefits whatsoever to large pools.

The first thing actually is probably to check if there are any existing projects that you may be able contribute to instead.
If you really want to start a new project, you increase your chance of finding contributors if you have some sort of proof of concept / prototype. So start developing!
After that, topics like version control (GIT), release management, workflows for contribution (Pull Requests, ...), unit testing and documentation become very important very fast.
And to be successful, it really helps to be good at all of this. When doing OSS you open yourself up to criticism from the whole software developer world (which is a good thing if you can cope with it).
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:10:53
Just saying that first of all, you have to get consensus. And I doubt the consensus will be to redefine "bitcoin". Even if all wallets, merchants and exchanges update, you still have old books, blog posts, forum threads, emails, ...

Well I can make an educated guess that bitcoin will ultimately not be limited by the current maximum block size. It's literally just a number in a textfile*.

I already adressed that?! So with bits he too says just "its 200k" someday. And until we're at the point where it is understood that he's talking about "bits" not "dollar", he can say "two hundred thousand bits", or "two million bits". How is this different or a problem at all?
Again: I have no objection to shorten the amount of zeroes by using "k", "m" or whatever in a way that people are already used to with the dollar or other currencies. People are NOT used to mega, kilo (even though thats what the "k" stands for), deci, centi, milli, micro in regards to currency. Not in the US and not in the EU nor anywhere in the world.


I definitely think it is way more cumbersome to always have to convert mentally between "btc", "mbtc", "ubtc"/"bits". If a wallet shows large amounts as "10m bits" or whatever, that's ok. People are used to that.
@_date: 2014-11-14 08:46:22
If bitcoin surpasses previous highs even slightly, we are already in the 4 digit range for a lunch paid with bits. So millions really was overly dramatic.
If bitcoin continues it's *long-term* trend, we will be in a 3 digit range not too long from now, which is already absolutely normal for a lot of people around the world.

The pools are the theoretical commons, not the individual miners. If ghash.io doesn't do what it does, someone else will.
On top of that we have the miners acting on the belief that the biggest pool must be the best / most profitable. But the biggest problem is probably cex.io offering a service in a way no one else does and pointing all hashing power to ghash.io (since there are essentially one and the same).

She does, as an investment (a pretty small one though).


They will care about decentralization. Not because it's a neat technical solution, but because the kind of problems it eventually solves in our society. And once they begin to use it, most will care about privacy, just as with the internet (-- not all may know how to handle privacy, but if you ask 99% are in favour of it).


They will never care about the technical aspects of bitcoin. They will however care about what the technology can do. They have to realize it for themselves, though. Currently it just sounds like a too-good-to-be-true sales pitch. But Bitcoin is here now. As long as it works and no serious issues with the protocol are found (and that chance gets slimmer every second), it's only about the timetable.
Sure, a well crafted ad campaign including a funny, but hard hitting superbowl halftime ad would probably expedite things. But that requires money that people will only spend because they see the potential, the opportunities, not because some small reddit community decided to sponsor a starcraft 2 tournament.

Don't try to read and react to the market. Write those $400 dollar off now. Store the bitcoin in a cold wallet. Whatever happens to the price: don't panic. Also don't sell if the price doubles next week.
Bitcoin is an asymmetric bet: you can only lose what you put it, but you stand to win a whole lot more if it succeeds (and I'd argue the odds of success are pretty big at this point and only grow higher).

Jeff Garzik seems to be in favour of it, as does Gavin Andresen. A lot of wallets at least added it as an option and it's the primary plan of the bitcoin foundation regarding a standard unit. Nearly all those tips recently were either in custom monikers or in bits.

It doesn't but it makes sense if you think about it. Existing forum software like phpBB, SMF, vBulletin is a code mess, has a ton of features no one wants, is historically very unsecure and very old fashioned.
From what I understand, Theymos hired a developer team to built forum and bitcoin related stuff. The main project is the "epochtalk" forum software which will be available for free to anyone. Together with the other projects/components they're working on, it will form the new bitcointalk plattform.
So we, the bitcoin community, get a platform that's tailored to our needs and the rest of the world gets an MIT licensed modern alternative to vBulletin &amp; co.
Also there are a few technical differences in regards to scalability (they're using stuff that didn't really exist when the other boards started).
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:36:16
It's not about being the best, but about being the first and good enough solution.
Any altcoin that offers an improvement is confronted with the already massive network effect of bitcoin and the fact that bitcoin is not finalized and can adopt good ideas, as long as the majority agrees. And if there's no consensus, we don't have a real contender in the first place.
Any altcoin that is just a different instance of the blockchain is irrelevant. Why would miners switch? What's the motive?

And that's only what's visible on github. Most likely every dev additionally has local feature branches with more commits that are not yet merged and pushed to github.
And that's only commits, not planning / designing and discussing the project. Also, a time intensive problem may have been solved with one tiny commit. If you want to judge the work being done by number of commits or lines of code, "you're going to have a bad time."

Good luck with μBTC and making that happen. The SI system is correct, but "bits" is just right. Colloquially it will be "bits" anyway at some point. So why not go with it?
The potential confusion with the existing bit unit in computing is a very weak argument at best.

Well, on our way to the current price we passed the $2 price point. Obviously that was enough to spark all that speculation. Maybe it's not the price, but simply bitcoin being a new asset class that enables all of this.

You can cringe at that cheesy "the truth is out there" all you want :)
It's true though. If bitcoin is to succeed, then it will do so on it's merits alone. And the truth is: the hard part is over. The iffy part was to get from a handful of users with a proof of concept to the point where hundreds of thousands of people use bitcoin services that have been financed with millions of dollars of investment capital.
Bitcoin will inevitably grow, because it's just better than existing solutions. Citizens of first world countries may not see any reason to use it for a while, because currently there are almost no tangible / immediate benefits in doing so. But they will see the bigger picture eventually.
Sure, signing some petition somewhere, or holding up a sign somewhere else may convince some people a little bit sooner (and probably drive others away at the same time), but I don't think any of those things will have much effect. The real momentum comes from bitcoins properties. It may start slow, but it's unstoppable by external factors.

If you have two versions of bitcoin, users using the one that ends up without a majority risk losing money. If you add those complexities, that would not happen, because there only is a valid new version if the majority of miners/users already adopted it. I'd call no risk of splitting the network an improvement.

that's a catalysator, not a prerequisite.
The blackjack analogy is a bad one. Nothing is really certain in life, but that doesn't make everything a gamble. If you learned about bitcoin and make an informed decision you are not speculating, you are investing.

You talk about the risks of increasing the block size, what about the risks of not doing anything? Keeping the limit at 1MB is not the continue-as-is option, IMHO.
If 20MB is too much and if even Gavin corrects that number to 8MB, then let's just go with 4MB. Most people agree that 1MB is not a magic number and probably too small in the long run. Kick the problem down the road and live to fight another day.
If 1MB worked 5 years ago, 4MB won't be a technical risk when this change goes live.

As I understand it, transaction malleability is a documented fact in the bitcoin protocol which can turn into a problem if custom implementations do not respect that. The devs are now extending the reference implementation to include some form of id that actually can be used to properly/uniquely identify a transaction.

Surely we still have a bit room to grow, though. At the very least we scale by riding Moore's/Nielsen's law. It might be impossible to use the current tech to do payments for every coffee in the world, but you make it sound like 3 tps is the end of the line here.
You want the focus to be on improving the underlying tech and you consider any workaround / short-term solution inferior, but please don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. Especially if the "right way" to improve the tech stays out of reach long enough to let everything go to shit first.

Exactly! This is the key question to which there is no good answer yet: At what rate can we grow the blocksize while retaining or improving current decentralization levels?
Until we have a good, agreed upon answer, it doesn't make sense to do a hard fork, especially now with SegWit on the table. For now we're stuck with proposals that either seem too conservative or too radical to one side or the other.
With Layer 2 solutions on the horizon and the fact that censorship resistance through decentralization is bitcoin's core value proposition, we should err on the conservative side.

If it's just another instance of the exact same thing, it would be used the same way and face the same restrictions in the US, eventually. So, why switch?

OK, step 3 from your tutorial mentions picking a password. Where do you enter that password? On a computer you'll have to trust. If the computer is compromised it may record your keystrokes. Then do it offline you say? Well, better keep that computer offline forever, because a keylogger can record your keystrokes while offline and sent it to the hacker once you connect the computer to the internet again. So the secure password you chose: possibly compromised. Same goes for your encrypted BIP38 wallets -- if you type the password on a computer and connect that computer to the internet in the future, you have to assume your password (and the wallet itself) is compromised. That's the reason you're getting downvoted, and that's the problem Trezor solves.

Why is it important to you? You don't create the blocks. The network can be sybill attacked and miners could essentially set the blocksize to whatever they want. Is it not rational to assume that they'd eventually use that tool to maximize their profits? Either by indefinitely keeping the blocklimit below demand to increase fees, or by making it so large that competitors (e.g. miners outside the great firewall of china) are at a severe disadvantage. Whatever is more profitable.
You're giving miners more power. Even ignoring the technical aspects of BU, the complexities this change introduces far outshadow SegWit's "technical debt" shortcomings. Add the general hard fork risks to that and the decision should be a no-brainer.

Here are the two options:
1. A soft fork update that is backwards compatible and thus allows users to upgrade when/if they want. It might seem complicated to you (as a non-developer or a developer who is not that involved in the project), but it is *very well* understood and tested by those who have the necessary expertise to make that judgement. The vast majority of technical people do like it, all things considered. There's no risk of forking the network in two, since it only activates if 95% of miners indicate support -- practical consensus. Non-miners are unaffected because of backwards compatibility. That means no change is forced onto anyone.
2. A hard fork update that is *not* backwards compatible and thus requires everyone to upgrade simultanously. If you don't upgrade, while a large enough majority does, you effectively lose access to your bitcoins (until you upgrade). If you are fundamentally opposed to the change (for which there are valid reasons) and refuse to apply it to your node, you're left behind with a crippled network. And there's a real chance of two permanent chains. Don't let claims that what happened to ethereum can't happen to bitcoin because of the 2 week retarget period fool you. It's software. If a large enough minority wants to keep the original bitcoin going, they can. And there are very large bitcoin holders who indicated exactly that. There's also the risk of confusion, which opens up possibilities for scammers. A botched hard fork can set us back quite a few years, or open up an opportunity for something else to gain popularity.
SegWit does not preclude future blocksize increases. It does however enable a lot of new options. It's not required for anything the "evil blockstream corp" has planned. It fixes stuff that's annoying, makes future upgrades easier and offers immediate blocksize increase (up to 2x or so, depending on adoption). It's not supposed to be *the* answer to the scaling issue. It's one step in a very right direction.
Many people view fhe soft-fork option as the *far* less risky one. The fact that hard-fork supportes are simply handwaving away issues and implications of their approach doesn't help.

Do you think slickage is not suited? If so, why?
Theymos mentioned milestones before, but I can't find the post right now. Timeframe as well IIRC, but big software projects are almost always delayed.
The software is open source, accessible by everyone via github. It will be free even for commercial use. They did some Q&amp;A in the forums about the software. It is fair to all parties, namely theymos and slickage. There are no other parties directly involved. Donating a few bitcoins for forum perks didn't give anyone a voice in the matter. The fact that those donated bitcoins dramatically appreciated in value later on doesn't change that. And again: most funds are not even from donations, but ad revenue.
People are just shocked that professional software development can cost a lot of money, almost adorably so in their naivety. And because they can't fathom the amount being spend, they scream foul play. Just has to be right? "1mio lol, phpBB is free!!! r u stupid?!!?! my brother is a cod3r he could do it on a weekend lulz"

First of all, the question was about wether or not it could happen to anyone with a wishlist and the answer to that question is a definite yes. If you have a stolen credit card you can buy stuff on people's whishlists. Purse doesn't have (AFAIK) or need a special deal with Amazon. Period.
As to the why, here are three plausible scenarios:
- We're in contact an I offer you 75% of the purchase price in cash if you buy stuff from my wishlist.
- I'm a fake amazon account with your neighbours address and you're intercepting the packages.
- I'm a camgirl you want to impress (or get to do things for you).

Solution to what problem?
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:20:06


My question was: why is setting a limit important to you as a non-mining node operator? As I explained in the part you skipped, you're effectively putting miners in complete control anyway -- so why not be honest about it an simply accept blocks of any size? (With some basic, hardcoded rules to prevent a rogue miner from creating a gigabyte block.)
This would also have the added benefit of not having to add `x` to the number of confirmations you need to wait to have some confidence level of `y`. (e.g. when 3 confirmations was good enough for you before, then with BU it's 3+x depending on the current network conditions.)


I don't follow. Can you elaborate?


You want to make it more democratic, but you don't acknowledge that we have no reliable way of counting votes.


Great, but you're not free to run whatever software like if you want to participate in the bitcoin network. All you can do is try to convince the network to change as a whole and in that process most likely force those changes onto a minority opposition. The AD/EB would change a lot, if adopted. It would give miners more power within the system that we call Bitcoin.

So, by your definition, if we want to have a sustainable decentralized network, we need to activate SegWit. Because SegWit is a feature that introduces script versioning, fixes malleability and increases the blocksize. And it does so in an opt-in manner, once activated. I think SegWit is beneficial for me.


The point is simple: Yes, everyone can run whatever software they like. If they want to interact with the majority of bitcoin exchanges, merchants, users and miners however, they have no such freedom. So miners do not already have the power BU would give them.


Increasing max_block_size would not cut you off the network?

Because of the risk reward ratio. Risk is near zero, rewards are malleability fixes, linear scaling of sighash operations, signing of input values, increased security for multisig via P2SH, script versioning, reducing UTXO growth, efficiency gains when not verifying signatures and a block size increase.
Why near zero risk you ask?
For this attack to "work" you need to convince at least 51% of miners to prepare to attack the network by faking segwit support with the intent to rollback all of those benefits weeks after they've been activated via contentious hardfork. You need to coordinate those miners to start attacking at block X and begin redistributing the bitcoins in those anyone can spend inputs to all participating miners.
You did all that? Congrats, it worked! But you have accomplished nothing sans a crash in price and a temporary doubling of confirmation times. You effectively created an altcoin. Yes, the chain is longer and contains more work, but it's not valid to the vast majority of fullnodes. Exchanges, merchants and end users won't care very much about what you've done. Their software won't recognize the stolen bitcoins as your bitcoins. You won't be able to trade them for anything. Meanwhile you have accrued a massive financial loss by wasting all that hashing power.
If you now say that the risk is still too high, then I ask: Why would anyone use bitcoin today when there is an attack known to exist where 51% of miners can double spend their transactions and censor everyone elses?

It is not priced in by the people that are waking up to the fact that there even is a halving in supply coming. Also there are a lot of factors at play. Do I think the price will double on block 420,000? No. I do however think that we haven't really felt the full effect of the halving yet.

The difference is the timespan. With the halving, it happens immediately compared to several weeks/months with the difficulty adjustments.
If hashrate abruptly drops by 50% at the halving, we're looking at 20min block intervals for four weeks. That might affect the price which essentially reduces the subsidy even more and could cause other miners to shut down. If the hashrate drops far enough, we might never make it to the next difficulty adjustment. Not saying it's likely -- after all it's no secret and can be / should have been taken into account. Just pointing out what's at stake.

A 2MB hard fork is an opt-in upgrade which leaves you with jack shit if you decide against opting-in while the economic majority does. It offers a choice, but a pretty unfair one.
A soft-fork is an opt-in upgrade that doesn't exclude you if you don't opt-in. Your bitcoin will still be honored as bitcoins everywhere there is a "bitcoin accepted" sticker -- wether you upgrade or not.
Both achieve roughly the same capacity increase. Arguments about complexity and technical debt are best left to the actual bitcoin developers. Which are in favour of SegWit by a large margin.

Absolutely. I feel that is generally doing a great job, but with bitcoinxt he made a bad call. He has his set of rules and with a little eye squinting XT violated those. In his fear that XT could divide bitcoin in two camps he essentially started to divide the bitcoin community in two, doing much of the same damage he wanted to prevent in the first place. Instead of adjusting course, admitting not everything is black and white, he doubled down on his policies. That was a huge mistake, IMHO. And the decisions to suddenly hide scores and change default sorting are all attempts to manipulate public opinion and are deplorable.
The removal of coinbase looks, as jgarzik said, "like amateur hour to outsiders" and I absolutely agree. Very disappointing.

No, bitcoin is not under attack by blockstream. No, their grand master plan is not to make money off of LN by running hubs or anything like that (there are no hubs within lightning). It's like saying they want to make money off of segwit or multisig.
Their mission is to safely improve bitcoin as best as possible and become the company that other companies will go to when they need anything bitcoin related.

You know that SegWit effectively increases the blocksize, yes? The fact that it doesn't require a hardfork is due to tricking / misinforming old nodes so that *from their point of view* blocks are never &gt;1MB.

Bitcoin is of course whatever people collectively call bitcoin. It is what the majority of exchanges, merchants, miners and users run while honoring the chain back to the genesis block. Everything else is *technically* bitcoin or *technically* not bitcoin. The proof of work algorithm or the 21M limit don't define bitcoin.

Since many people are kinda expecting something to happen soon, it probably won't. I'd say we'll stay at around 400 through the halving and then, when despair sets in and the price dips it'll rebound and we'll get our new ATH and with it a fresh wave of new users.

All other issues aside: we do not have a voting mechanism for this. You could easily spawn thousands of nodes for relatively low cost and influence the blocksize to your liking, especially if you have access to a botnet.
You can't fake hashrate that easily.

To the contrary. My point was simply that 51% guarantees a successful majority attack, as long as you can keep your majority until you have the longest chain, which would happen eventually.

It signals the state of your software project within your release management workflows / policies. If your policy is to put a 1.0.0 tag on your software whenever you feel like it then it's meaningless, yes, otherwise it's not.
Also, 0.x.x means "can change a lot". Once you have a release version, minor updates (minor/patch) should not break things (no API changes, etc).

Sorry Roger, bitcoin is not the same project it was 7 years ago. It's dangerous to act like nothing has changed.
You sound much like a kid in a candy store. I want this, I want that. Revolutionary decentralized, digital cash for everyone and everything, everywhere. Maybe scaling up to that point is not possible the way Satoshi described it in an offhand bitcointalk post several years ago ("just don't care how large the blocks get!"). Do you think Satoshi woke up one day and wrote the bitcoin.pdf from top to bottom in one take? I think it's much more likely that he had different revisions, constantly threw stuff out the window and worked on things until everything was just right to get things started. So I don't know why you're putting (a deliberate selection of) his posts on a pedestal like he had just written the infallible word of a crypto deity. I'm not saying he should be ignored if he makes a comeback, because an appeal to authority is not a fallacy if the person is an expert on the topic, which Satoshi would obviously be. But so are the core developers.
Anyway, Satoshi knew he had a genius idea but that there were people smarter than him to take it to the next level. And he was *happy* about it when they joined development. So happy in fact that he felt comfortable to just disappear. Well, at least his pseudonym did -- who knows, maybe he's working for blockstream now?
In any case, what was originally promised is not changed and is still pursued. The way we get there however is changed. Because scientific, critical thinkers like to adjust their views based on what they observe.
If (and only if) it turns out we can't have everything, like aforementioned kid in the candy store, bitcoin core values security and censorship resistance above everything else. Why is this not your position as well?
And next time you bring up your latecomer narrative, keep in mind that the person you have your biggest grudge with has been here longer than you. And many in that group of people don't agree with you.

Do you think a BitShare chip in a smartphone will be any competition to a state of the art ASIC? I mean, it would have to be ridiculously efficient and deployed in so incredibly large numbers to carve out a decent percentage of the total network hashrate. If it were so good, 21 would be better off keeping their bitcoin mining operations running -- something they don't seem to be doing.
This thing is not primarily about mining. Being able to generate some satoshis to use in some form or another is the point here I think. Think colored coins etc.

You leverage the fact that a big part of the community values your technical expertise to effectively make decisions on the blocksize issue for everyone else. You are a vital part of the process to bring about change to the network. You can't just point your finger to the users.
I'm not even saying you're making the wrong decisions, but you do decide.
The trust in your technical expertise is well deserved, but there are more aspects to the bitcoin system. Sometimes being technically correct is not what matters to be successful. Sometimes pride can cloud judgement and actions are driven by the need to be right. Perfect being the enemy of the good and all that jazz.

I don't think we are speculating much on the usefulness of bitcoin. Most people here see the potential. The speculation is more along the lines of: when will the broader public realize this?

SW expands capacity but also bandwidth and processing requirements, just in a way that can be done as a softfork. So the increases due to SW are not "free".
Let's say SW doubles the capacity. If you simultaneously raise the limit to 8MB you'll effectively have a 16 MB blocklimit but you'll also have to be able to handle 16 MB blocks in case they get filled.
Personally I think a hardfork to 2MB and +20% per year with a clean SegWit implementation on top is the way to go. Arguments against a hardfork include that we don't have any experience yet, but I think all devs agree that we have to do one eventually to increase the 1MB limit. So we should get that hardfork experience ASAP, while the node count is low and 90% of hashpower can meet and greet during a conference.

Keep in mind that it's not really clear what percentage of those transactions are made with stolen credit cards. I'd wager a guess that it's pretty rare that amazon is hit with one given the fact that purse still exists. Purse is supposed to have some form of fraud prevention IIRC.

@_date: 2017-02-28 11:18:00
I personally liked Gavin's position a few years back and I always thought (and still think) he is an open minded, reasonable guy.
1MB seems small and so much below what our current hardware should be able to handle. Gavin, as someone who did 3D stuff in the late 90s or so, is deeply skeptical of people that want to establish technical hardlimits based on the current state of the art and derive decisions from that. That's understandable. Not only did the CGI sector blow everyone's mind over the past decade or two, TCP/IP has also been declared in the past to never be able to handle streaming videos. Cue Netflix.
So I get that point. "Just don't care how big the blocks will get" as Satoshi himself put it.
But of course, much more comes into play the longer you think about it. There are moral hazards with pushing backwards incompatible network upgrades onto a minority. Sure, the minority is "free" to stay on their preferred version. With the caveat being that their bitcoins will just lose every bit of value in the process. Claiming that no one is forced into upgrading is ignorant and dishonest.
It's also indisputable that raising the max blocksize will increase the operating cost for nodes. In the beginning the increase would be hardly measurable, but it would add up quickly. Proposing blocksize increases as the defacto, long term scaling solution as Bitcoin Unlimited is doing is an attempt at centralizing bitcoin. That would make it far more susceptible to censorship and control.
We should keep the max blocksize as low as possible for as long as possible. Value decentralization over capacity. We need too make bitcoin impossible to stop before it's showing its true colors to powerful people which interests don't align very well with the goals of bitcoin. Increasing the userbase does not increase decentralization as the absolute number of fullnodes has gone down significantly over the past years while the number of users shot up.
SegWit is special because it provides a backwards compatible way of increasing capacity. I'm convinced everyone who wants more capacity and is against SegWit has ulterior motives. Be it a misplaced protest against censorship, wanting to divide the community, having issues with the personalities involved or something entirely else.

And as if that's not enough: If a hardfork is a "fair enough" choice in order to go along with it, then why are you not forking off with Bitcoin Unlimited, *right now*? Go get your miners, adjust the difficulty once to compensate and build your own blockchain. What's holding you back? Maybe the same cons that you're confronting a minority with in case of a hardfork?

@_date: 2017-03-12 13:57:32
First of all: you seem to be unable to give a straight answer to my question.
Second: 


This is exactly what is meant by blocksize being determined by miners: miners can run as many nodes as they see fit to heavily influence the vote. If "determine" is too strong for you, I can happily settle for "BU allows miners to heavily influence the blocksize". Doesn't change anything.
So we agree: node count is irrelevant because it's easily faked. We don't seem agree about what that means for BU, though. Why is it different in that case?


Yes, because while I won't be making many on chain bitcoin transactions directly, I still very much rely on the blockchain remaining valid when I use lightning or something like it. I mean I run a node right now and I usually transact only once a month.


That's a loaded question because it's not yet clear where the cut off is. We don't know how high fees will go, because we don't know how big the blocksize will become. Yes, the core roadmap includes a blocksize increase beyond SegWits &lt;4MB. Flexcap or something dynamic in general.
And again, as long as I use anything that is rooted in the bitcoin blockchain, I have enough motive to run a node. If I do on-chain transactions even more so -- which I will, because even Lightning requires it.

@_date: 2016-01-15 12:41:04
Everyone wants bitcoin to scale (being able to handle more than three transactions per second).
**One camp wants to do it in a very simple way: increase the arbitrary, self imposed speed limit by essentially changing one number in the code, ASAP.**
The speed limit exists to protect the bitcoin network against "denial of service" attacks where it would be put under too much load and everything grinds to a halt. People in this camp say processing power, network bandwidth and storage have and will continue to improve and thus we can and should increase the speed limit to reflect that.
**The other camp wants to do it in a far more complex way, by essentially improving bitcoin so it can handle more transactions while consuming the same or less resources.**
They're saying that while it's true that processing power etc. has improved, there could still be negative consequences if we increase the limit today. Increasing the limit increases the system requirements of running the bitcoin core software (= a fully validating, transaction relaying node/wallet, not your mobile bitcoin app), which would make it more expensive and thus would disincentivize running one. Fullnodes are important and we want more, not less. They want to make bitcoin more efficient, so that the requirements stay the same when the limit is increased some day.
Improving bitcoin this way is far more complex and requires a lot more time, but blocks are getting full today (= more than half on average and there's congestion during peaks). People fear that if we don't do something soon, user experience may suffer (higher fees, higher confirmation times). Some changes also need time (6-12 months) before they can take effect.
Both camps agree that the speed limit needs to be increased at some point anyway. And both camps also want those code improvements in. The disagreement is mainly on what to do when and the specifics, e.g. what exactly the new speed limit should be, how it is determined.
That's the technical side. There's also a social / political side to this: Who gets to decide what's going to be done when?

Jihan shared a link on weibo to a post that makes exactly that case. It's reasonable to assume he shared it because he agreed with it and he hasn't made a statement to the contrary. From the translation:






He wants the blocksize to be whatever benefits him the most. To be fair, that's not evil but rational if you're a for-profit miner. Wether or not that means increasing the size at this point remains to be seen. I mean he *is* mining empty blocks currently.

Or old nodes simply never see the new transactions (except the coinbase transaction).

The difference is that the real genesis block starts with zero amount of work. It's simply the first block in the chain. There's nothing to validate before that.
A "checkpoint genesis block" starts at a non-zero value for work. There have been blocks before that checkpoint and you can't verify the proof of work presumably done, so you have to *trust* that it's valid.
This is why you *cannot* identify the correct chain by yourself in that scenario.
An attackers chain might just lie to you that it has more work than the legit chain. How would defend against that if you don't have any knowledge about the chain pre-checkpoint?

You can't have true global p2p cash AND have it easy to use.
I mean if you want to track all the coffees of the world with vanilla bitcoin, you can't have small blocks and an easy to use fullnode. Even if starting up a fullnode only needs a mere minute, there will be some centralized service who'll cut that down to effectively zero. Or provide a service to less powerful mobile devices.
If you don't track the coffees, then it's not really p2p cash. It becomes a more expensive dispute settlement system. A foundation for something that will be build on top. (Which is of course also cool.)
Lightning is interesting, but even there you need to be online 24/7 or have some centralized service watch the channel for you.
A truely decentralized p2p cash system for all the transactions in the world might not be technically possible for the next several years or possibly decades. We need to make tradeoffs somewhere to have something good (not perfect) today.
I mean that's the crux of the matter currently. Some say let's just keep increasing the blocksize and see where that leads us. I think that bitcoin wouldn't be a failed project if it actually required data-center level of computing, as long as there are enough independent datacenters doing it. There are diminishing returns when adding new fullnodes to the network. The most important fullnode is the second one. The 5000th fullnode is not as important.
Other's say we need to view the blockchain as this fundamental layer on which we build more scalable solutions. Then it makes sense to keep the fundamentals small, easy to use and focussed on their one task.
I'm still not sure what the better approach is. Both sides engage in stupid fear mongering and dishonest, cherry-picking rhetoric to get their point across.

Yes, with miners it's a little different. Hence the 95% threshold.
There are also evil soft forks which could force old nodes to upgrade in order to be able to produce transactions that are accepted by upgraded miners.
I'd say anything that doesn't hinder (non-mining) old nodes from continuing as usual among themselves is a soft fork. In case of SegWit they actually benefit from the increased capacity without upgrading.

Kind of. But BU doesn't just increase the blocksize, it let's users vote for one. Which sounds good at first, but really isn't once you realize that few people can act (and vote) as many. It gives miners a degree of control they didn't have before. This is very much unchartered territory and has implications that BU proponents are ignorant about. Criticism falls on deaf ears. They feel like they're sticking it to the man (core) and are euphoric about it.
Most bitcoin developers outright reject their proposal for a number of reasons.

They are experts on the technical stuff and their arguments are usually rooted there. Not everyone who disagrees is uninformed, but there are very few valid arguments to be made against the core road map. Usually those arguments are in favour of an even more conservative approach.

For any serious decision you either defer to experts (collectively) or become an expert yourself. The latter is seldom feasible.


Uhm, no I'm very much not.


So what did you mean when you said that instead of listening to experts, you should "research [for] yourself and come to your own conclusion"? Ignore expert opinion in favour of your own non-expert opinion?
I mean, what would you do if you go to the doctor and he has bad news for you?

This is misguided and ignorant about the dangers/implications of hard forks. Hard forks should only be considered if they're absolutely necessary, not to soothe children throwing a tantrum.

I think the big transaction generators (exchanges, online wallets, payment processors) will almost immediately make the switch. SegWit will increase throughput very fast, maybe not directly to the maximum, but still. I think we will will see +50-75% capacity in the first week or two (after the locked in period of two weeks).

To nodes, not users. And in terms of EB/AD "voting", a few miners can simply spin up a lot of nodes.
I mean this is already happening. Look at the BU fullnode charts. The day the bug was exploited, BU nodecount suddenly dropped by 75%. While this *could* be attributed to a well coordinated attack, **they also came back online at the same time**. There are only a few real users behind those hundreds of nodes. And they already do influence opinion. It couldn't be more clear what miners in favour of BU are most likely up to.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:45:41
And if you try to explain that fullnodes do validate the chain, their answer is "Bitcoin doesn't work like that, because you can sybill attack fullnodes!".
Many of them just know the words and merely remix the soundbites they've heard into something that validates their beliefs.
That and the inability to accept that some people aren't being arrogant, they just really do know better than you.

No one is disputing that. The fact that you don't want to acknowledge is that it's very dangerous in the case of bitcoin and should only happen when there is technical necessity and overwhelming consensus on it. And neither prerequisites are met with the 2mb hard fork proposal. Especially when a soft fork way of increasing the block size is not only available, but ready for activation at any time.


We can see the other part on and \*.bitcoin.com and twitter and and and. No thanks, it's not convincing... at all. And whatever the moderation policies here are, it's just a fact that the majority of people who actually know what they're talking about are against BU and in favour of core / SegWit. **Their opinion isn't based on what's visible in this subreddit.** An unmoderatored, public discussion of laymen won't change their mind when the realities just don't support the BU supporter's argument.
The moderation here is completely irrelevant when assessing the viability of BU as a product or general idea. **It's not a popularity contest.**


Mindlessly repeated talking points that have no basis in reality. Blockstream was founded by the core developers we all know and loved (at least back then). The devs are *contractually* guaranteed to be outside the influence of investors. In case they disagree with management, they can quit at any time and receive a full salary for *another year*. They have bitcoin timelocked away as an incentive to increase their value. Bet you didn't know *any* of that. And don't bother trying to convince me you did and somehow this all doesn't matter -- I won't believe you.

I wonder what the LN dev community thinks, but at the current pace I wouldn't be suprised if we see a stable mainnet release within a year. Blocking SegWit might slow that down, though.
In any case, while it won't solve all our problems, it will solve a lot.
There are a lot of scaling options... SegWit for +100% or more, Schnorr Signatures for another 30%-40%. Lightning Network and maybe flexcap / dynamic blocksize / extension blocks at some point.
BU does far less, far more recklessly and doesn't even guarantee any kind of increase.

Again, it *seems* Jihan does in fact do exactly that. (And most people don't oppose SegWit at all.)


I think you will have trouble finding a quote to really substantiate that exact claim. I believe core is saying there is no point in doing a hard fork now with SegWit on the table. And I absolutely agree. They say let's first slowly double the blocksize with an opt-in soft fork and see how the network reacts. Collect data to make better decisions for future hardforks. E.g. how does a doubling affect decentralization?
I'm pretty sure no core contributor particularly likes that hardcoded 1MB limit.


No, this is what some people *choose* to hear. Because they have preconcieved notions about the motivations of the people involved.

What do you base that on in both cases?


Criticism of core also includes trying to solve tomorrows problems, which *is* exactly that... looking at the big picture. I'd say Roger is rather short sighted and naive. He wants everything, know. Secure, decentralized and performant. "I'll take this, this and that. What do you mean, 'I have to choose'? NO! I WANT IT ALL. NOW."
BU tells him what he wants to hear. They can't back it up properly, but he doesn't see that. He doesn't *want* to see that.


This whole analysis of yours is pure conjecture. You have nothing to base this on exept a gut feeling/emotion and a *very* liberal, narrative preserving interpretation of facts.
In a group of 100 scientist with 99 arguing for climate change, you cling to the one denier. Why?
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:10:16
The point is, we should avoid hard forks whenever possible. SegWit gives us 2MB+ blocks without the risks introduced by a hard fork.
Another point is that we should be rational and logical about this and not be bullied into a worse solution.
I get where you are coming from as this was my opinion a few months ago as well. But the longer you look at it, the clearer the picture becomes. One side has the technical expertise, facts and reason, the other side as a grudge. They just want to be against something or someone. In this case "borgstream core".

I personally won't get my hopes up that much, but it's certainly not an obvious fact that it can't get that far.
For the simple reason that bitcoin has done a more extreme version of this in the past:
2013-01-01: $13
2013-11-30: $1,132
(And no, I don't buy that it was faked by MtGox/Willy)

If for *all practical purposes* it's guaranteed that we maintain a level of decentralization that leaves bitcoin highly censorship resistant, then I don't see any problem at all.


I meant improvements of the actual network (bandwidth, latency, packet loss). And if there is literally no point in excluding any non-zero fee transaction, then that's the best case scenario for bitcoin.

Some people like to be right all the time very much and when someone suggest that they might not be, they get all defensive and expend a lot of energy on maintaining their view.
I think that's possibly a factor, but I can't imagine that it's malice. I completely believe they're doing what they think is the best thing for bitcoin, without any strings attached. And again, chances are they are right. I personally don't think they are, at least not 100%, but who am I to say?
@_date: 2016-03-05 06:40:11


Really? "Some CAN handle bigger blocks some CANNOT." -&gt; "EVERYBODY CAN HANDLE 2MB BLOCKS."
That's why.


Why do you assume this is because they can't handle 1MB (or e.g. 100KB for that matter?). You *know* that's not the reason, so why bring it up? Looks like manipulative crazy talk.


Sadly, no.

@_date: 2016-03-05 11:38:24


I disagree. Issue: transactions hit limit. Solution: increase limit. The fact that we now have to hardfork to *continue* to do that is a technical detail.


Spare me the superficial analysis or I'll start arguing that the blocksize issue already has a positive effect on nodecount:  Correlation is not causation (and yeah, those new nodes probably disappear as fast as they appeared).
There's no evidence that an increase in blocksize will lead to a measurable decrease in fullnodes.


**This is plainly wrong.** You need to read up. It's an opt-in blocksize increase. Transactions aren't magically compressed, we just trick old nodes into thinking they're smaller than they really are by making the outputs look like "anyone can spend" outputs. Those 1.7mb blocks have to be transmitted to fully validating nodes, exactly like the 1mb blocks before.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:10:05
I'm convinced that everyone who supports BU specifically is either uninformed or has ulterior motives.
Their development team is subpar in size and quality. Their changes are giving miners more power at a time where most people agree that they already have too much.
Anyone who really wants a blocksize increase can safely support SegWit. It's an optional upgrade that almost immediately increases capacity and makes future increases easier (e.g. Schnorr signatures: an additional 30-40%).

No. So far we've been lenient with our employees aka miners. We said "whenever you are ready". They failed to signal readiness so far. They thought we were asking for their opinion.
Maybe a UASF is the right thing to do. Which is essentially saying "be ready until a certain deadline, or get fired".

Sure you can blindly surrender to your inborn tendency to mediate and try to make everyone happy. All things being equal, that's great. But things are far from equal. One side makes a logical, rational argument after carefully looking at all the facts. The other side makes a emotional one after ignoring facts that don't really support their narrative.
Compromise is not always the gold standard everyone needs to strive for (ignoring for a second that SegWit's blocksize increase can be seen as one).
If you don't think that's true than I'd like to point out that you probably have plenty of bitcoin while I have very little. Shall we compromise?
Edit: Sorry if I come off as aggressive, but after watching recent LN developments which kind of rely on SegWit being activated I'm really angry at the obstructionists and their enablers (even when they have good intentions). People need to educate themselves or refrain from participating in this discussion.

Again, I understand what you're trying to say. I disagree with the importance of it, especially if having an equal distribution on said map means severely limiting bitcoin.
You look at that map and tell me bitcoin is not trustworthy already. We have spain watching france, france watching germany, germany watching the UK, the UK watching the US, etc. pp. And even the couple of nodes in Johannesburg would immediately detect any shenanigans. Would it be nice to have nodes equally distributed? Of course! But how much importance do we give to that if it's obviously not even possible with 1MB blocks to have that. My question still is: How much does it really matter? And again I say: Not much. Especially if you're generally fine with people using SPV wallets on mobile phones, then your case is very weak.
Like the 5001th node which doesn't add much to the decentralization of bitcoin (compared with the second and third nodes, etc), I'd say 100 more bitcoin nodes in South Africa won't make bitcoin really that much more trustworthy (even to south africans) to justify crippling the protocol.
Should we limit blocks to 100kb so that we might finally see some nodes pop up in Bolivia?

So how much of an increase in capacity SegWit actually is depends on the transaction mix. One estimate I've seen repeated a lot is a factor of 2.3. That would be more than doubling bitcoins capacity and represent an increase bigger then any (softlimit) increase before. We need to be careful as there's a lot at stake. Going for a little more than double is good. Especially because its opt-in meaning people can switch whenever they're ready and are not forced to. This is very reasonable.
But this actually distracts from the fact that SegWit does a lot of good things and the capacity increase is just a bonus that was later added as it turned out to be doable. SegWit ist not supposed to be *the* solution to the scaling issue. There will (hopefully) always be the need to further increase scale and scalability, whereever we're at at the time.
SegWit provides a little breathing room and the opportunity to study the real world effects of a blocksize increase. And it lays the groundwork for future scalability improvements, e.g. phasing in Schnorr signatures which would increase capacity again by *at least* 25%, most likely significantly more.
Doing what BU does the way they do it is nothing but irresponsible.

As you didn't answer my question I have to imagine the answer.
And what you say is wrong. SegWit had been worked on for quite a while without the blocksize increasing aspect. I believe then at some point realized that you could also, as a side-effect, increase the blocksize as a soft-fork with SegWit.

My opinion is that there will never be another serious blockchain with it's own genesis block replacing bitcoin. But this has nothing to do with network effects.
Bitcoin will always either directly incorporate new innovations or serve as an anchor for other chains with incompatible changes.
If for some reason another project manages to replace bitcoin (in its role as a value token) with a fresh new blockchain, then the only thing that accomplishes is to rob both of their value and discredit the very idea of blockchains as a store of value.

IIRC the agreement was that miners keep running the core client (including SegWit) and one or more core devs create a hard fork proposal that they can recommend as an option.
The deadline for such a proposal was met by (just in time), even though miners started signalling BU and broke the agreement.

Which is what you want to do if you're arguing for a hard fork. Even at 95% consensus you're forcing people to upgrade. The more people are forced, the worse it's going to be.


Characterizing those incidents as "hard-forks" is a stretch.
In any case, it was an emergency because of a bug. There was urgency and the entire bitcoin ecosystem was way smaller and actually worked together.
What worked in the past (out of necessity, mind you) isn't guaranteed to work today. Especially since it's apples and oranges anyway.

I can't tell how much of the opposition to larger blocks is legitimate concern and how much is driven by pride.
I wonder how much of a problem the fact is, that increasing the block limit just increases scale not scalability and is therefore an uninteresting, boring topic to the academics among the devs.
I don't buy the conspiracy theories, but I do think especially the software developer type desperately wants to be right all of the time. (source: I'm a software developer)
Making bitcoin not need big blocks is a worthwile goal and intellectually challenging. Increasing the limit a bit might still be the best course of action in practice right now.

Don't you agree that it is misleading?
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:44:48


I don't think SegWit and a blocklimit increase are interconnected on a technical level. I think the problem is that part of why SW is so cool and the devs are proud of it, is that it can effectively increase the blocklimit without requiring a hardfork. They found a way / solved a puzzle. Doing a hardfork then anyway takes something away from that victory. Despite the fact that SW is still cool and useful far beyond that (and could be implemented in a clean way via hardfork instead of hack-ish via softfork).

@_date: 2017-03-10 05:20:52


Sure, including miners.


You keep missing (or ignoring) the point that BU puts miners (and yes, other interest groups in general) in a position to at the very least *heavily* influence a blocksize vote.
Most users won't care as much or do not have the resources or technical knowledge to sybil attack the blocksize vote. Big miners do have motivation. However, it's not even clear yet what the motivation will end up being: increasing the blocksize to drive out smaller competitors, or actually decrease it to increase fee pressure. Like what AntPool is currently doing with their small/empty blocks.
What will you do if the voting doesn't suit you? Or the network in general? What do you do if you think that it's abused? (Within the allowed parameters.) Will you intervene? Isn't that what BU is supposed to stop?

@_date: 2017-03-17 19:38:48
Well, it's not really accurate.
More recent estimates put SegWit above 2MB.
BU doesn't really have a limit. Nodes set their blocksize parameter(s) individually and presumably that results in an emergent consensus. We then might see an average blocksize of 2MB, 4MB, 8MB or gigabytes eventually. It could also reduce the average blocksize to sub-1MB.
Problem is, with BU, miners would have a way to heavily influence what the blocksize will be. This gives them more power, which is why some miners really like the idea and support BU even though it's pretty clear now that it massively lacks in quality compared to core.
And that's not even touching on the whole soft vs hard fork argument in favour of SegWit.

OTOH behaviour of javascript components like this chart wildly differ from browser to browser and I somewhat doubt he would expose himself as a liar like that for such a minor thing.
But still... I'm deeply skeptical... Maybe he just is so invested that he needs to resort to stuff like that.

BU supporters should at least let go of their fantasy that we all will unite behind the BU project. The best they can hope for if they continue this is a permanent split of the bitcoin network. Some people will be drawn to the considerable amount of hashrate BU might get with Jihan behind them. Others, like goatpig explains convincingly, will never accept their proposition and stay with core. A lot of people will be caught in the middle.
If you think that hashrate rules and will beat core into submission, you have to realize that a symbolic single line of code can render that weapon completely useless.
If you think this is only a game of chicken and core supporters will flinch, you're going to be surprised and soon full of regret.
If bitcoin really splits into two permanent chains, NO ONE WINS.

He wrote what he wrote, then changed his mind about going public with this. He also edited his retraction and removed the part that suggested that he in fact *could* provide proof, but really can't because he would "betray a confidence" in doing so.
So he is principled and made a mistake by divulging that info publicly. Those principles also lead him to voluntarily resign as an rbtc mod way before all of this.
There's also the possibility that he just realized that there might be consequences for him telling the truth about all of this.
And yes, there's the possibilty that he just made that up, too. With the context I have, I find that to be less likely than the alternative.

Also the desktop PC is losing marketshare, a trend that will probably accelerate over the next years. It's all very iffy.

Verräterische Formulierung! :P


Whenever someone just repeats talking points and obviously doesn't understand what he is talking about, likes to cherry picks the things he is willing to talk about and puts an insane amount of spin on anything that contradicts his viewpoint, I get very skeptical. And at some point I've heard enough. The "we vs. them" I see is people who adjust their views based on what is seen vs. people who selectively look away to preserve their beliefs no matter the cost.
E.g. the current drama around the accusations of Ver funding astroturfing. Like 90% of rbtc is very quick to throw around all kinds of accusations for blockstream and core. Yet they choose to unconditionally belief whatever Ver tells them. Talk about being biased.
Or editing his screenshots to make BU look bigger than it is. His response about the inconsistencies in the pictures? "Oh yeah I noticed that too, that's weird! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"

Don't get your point.
As I understand it there a constantly new transactions being added to the mempool at varying rates and if those transactions can't be flushed into blocks, they built up into a backlog. If a wave of new transactions (which *can* happen naturally) hits a phase where far fewer than usual blocks are found, the backlog can build up quite quickly.
That being said, it's entirely possible (and probably a clever strategy) to wait for such a low blockrate phase to start creating spam transactions if you want to disrupt the network cost efficiently. OTOH, maybe someone running some kind of service pressed on some button that created a whole lot of legit transactions, just at a bad time.
I don't know, maybe it's manipulation, maybe not. But I believe it's not necessarily as easy to tell as you think.

Also interesting to note is that previously one of their main counterpoints to hard fork criticism was "no one is forced to upgrade" and that people can stay on their minority chain if they don't like it.

I think the premise of this questions is wrong. The size of blocks I will accept as valid is relevant for consensus, is it not?




No. I don't care *who* has an idea on how to improve bitcoin. I care about the idea and what experts say about it (because I, more often than not, have not enough expertise to judge).
However, I believe that any truely good idea will be accepted by core in a heartbeat.


Also no. The market is not the golden solution to every problem. I care about expert opinion. The market is usually biased towards a short sighted solution.
E.g. with SegWit, the case is pretty clear. A large absolute majority of experts are clearly and very outspoken in favour of it. The opposition is mostly politically motivated.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:42:51


It's not even a compromise. They just realized a blocksize increase could be done in an opt-in way without the risk of a hard fork. This simply changed the equation in favour of an increase.
Risk/reward never justified a hard fork blocksize increase. With SegWit, the risk was manageable.
No one is a fan of that 1MB constant. Not even "Bilderbergstream KKKore". It just serves a purpose and no one was able to convincingly make the case that their own solution serves it better.

But in my 99/1 scenario you *don't* have all the data. All chains are based on checkpoints.
Here's as I understand it:
If two blockchains start from the beginning, you can determine the legit one by validating each block in existence and adding up the proof of work. Valid to you + most work = your blockchain.
If you have two chains that both start at some checkpoint, you can't verify that their claim of the work done before that checkpoint is true. You'd have to trust that it is. A big no no.
Check points are fine to cut corners for less-than-full nodes. But you'd still have to have the entire blockchain around somewhere.
It also works if your node has been around for the entire time and witnessed &amp; validated the blocks that came before the checkpoint. But onboarding new nodes trustlessly would be difficult if not impossible. At least I haven't heard of an idea on how to do it.

You make irrelevant distictions. The (soft)limit was raised from 250kb to 350kb and then to 750kb in code and then to effectively 1MB by miners overriding the default. Look at the discussions around that time, exactly the same.
The only difference is that we now can't increase it further without bumping into an arbitrarily chosen hardlimit. Note that 1MB is not a magical number and the issue here is only that it requires a *hard fork*, as evidenced by recently greenlighting an effective increase by ~75% via segwit / softfork (the biggest absolute increase to date).
**The default policy is to increase.**
If you want to argue beyond the technical details of a hardfork, there are arguments to be made, but YOU need to provide the numbers.

As long as it's *massively* undervalued, people will hoard it. 
Once it stabilizes and gains value at a low and predictable rate (like fiat loses value at a predictable rate), people will  be increasingly trading it for the goods and services they need.
Just like people are *saving* money of constantly decreasing value, people will also be *spending* money of constantly increasing value.

Neither gold nor silver has intrinsic value.
It's the same as with paper money or bitcoin: it's only valuable as long as people have a use for it. Everyone agreeing that it's useful for exchange makes it useful. It's less intrinsic and more recursive.

@_date: 2016-06-29 08:53:55
I don't follow.
If a merchant charges more for the bitcoin payment option, it means they stand to gain more if people use the other options (but still wants to offer it as an alternative). Since fees are most likely lower with bitcoin it's probably because of the chance that a customer won't cancel his subscription right away for whatever reason.
If it's a one time payment anyway, bitcoin will most likely match or undercut the other payment options. If that's not the case, then the merchant might have additional administrative overhead with bitcoin (depends on *how* he accepts it).

It's not free money but it's close, IMHO. It's an asymmetric bet: if it fails, you can only lose what you invest. If it succeeds you stand to win a whole lot more. Chances of (continued) success are high and increase every day -- again *IMHO*.
The reason not everyone is investing big time today is that that's not easy to assess, especially for non tech-savvy folks. It smells like a scam / pretend money, until you look closer. Not many people do.
People like to think they understand money / value. Bitcoin shows them they're wrong. People generally don't like to be proven wrong.

No! Bitcoin *creates* consensus. That's its whole reason for existence. It's *not* a prerequisite.
We celebrate bitcoin for being permissionless. That means no, you don't need authorization from 95% of the network before you propose a change. You bring it forward and see if the network incorporates it.
If this is a change that directly conflicts with core, you better have good reasons for it or it will fall flat on its face like classic did.
Bitcoin doesn't care about any out of band rules. If it were dependent on those, the experiment would have failed.

There's also the problem of a bank run like scenario. If for some reason many people want to simultaneously close their channels, we might have a problem.

I'm 12 and taxation is theft!
Sure, technically it is. But on that level I'd argue not every type of theft is morally wrong.
Ideally you'd be able to exit a state that taxes it's citizens in favour of one that doesn't. It just happens that most nation states on this planet have realized that taxing their citizens to pay for certain things is a net positive for everyone involved.
And sure, mistakes are made, corruption exists and the world of politics is riddled with power hungry egomaniacs, but the systems we have are the best among those that humans tried so far. And if a democracy you live in (and intent to keep living in) at some point decides that UBI is a net positive, then you'll just have to deal with it. You think that's not fair? Maybe it isn't. But maybe it's still the thing that maximizes well-being for everyone. Maybe in that case life's technically unfair, but still pretty pretty good?

The only other thing someone with hashpower majority can do is double spend their own transactions. While bitcoin doesn't natively guard against that, it is still fraud in meatspace and thus not really an option as you're likely easily identifiable by your energy footprint alone with your &gt;50% of hashpower. Also, it's irrational as it's virtually impossible to pull off enough doublespends to make this costly attack profitable.

There's a company, founded by the top bitcoin code writers. They're still doing what they did before. Now they're getting paid for it.
What's your basis for your assumption of conflict of interest? Why do you think its impossible for the interests of the bitcoin communities to align with those of the blockstream investors? Why do you think the developers would accept anything else than total control on the work they've been celebrated for in the past, work they more importantly (and quite obviously) believe in?
Sure, it's *possible* the devs fell from grace, have ulterior motives and are trying to subvert the bitcoin community. All motivated by the big pockets of investors and their promises. (Promises that must be way more appealing than working to appraise the considerable amount of bitcoins the devs possess already, mind you.)
You have proof of that? Great. Let's hear it. Wait, you don't? Then shut the fuck up!
You (collectively) are just butthurt that they always annoyingly claim to know better than you. Ignoring the reality that they just do. I know it's quite fashionable at the moment to just scream liar at anyone who disagrees with you and treating opinions as facts, especially your own ones.

Most western societies have some sort of a social safety net. UBI takes that concept a little further (and removes a lot of bureaucratic overhead in the process). Instead of just making sure you don't die and have some form of roof over your head, it argues for ensuring a dignified life. A simple basic income you can improve upon if you put in the work.
I think UBI is inevitable, but just not yet achievable at this time.

There is no "MAX_BLOCK_SIZE" constant of 1MB anymore, but the stream of 1s and 0s that new nodes produce and send out as blocks are still interpreted as valid blocks by old nodes. This means it's backwards compatible and by definition a soft fork, although the above mentioned constant is gone.

With a soft fork, we all stay in the same boat. The majority might agree to always wear fancy hats when they're on deck, but you don't have to participate.
With a hard fork, we'd be putting the minority on a little raft and leave them dead in the water if they don't comply. Yelling at them: "See? You don't have to wear a hat if you don't waaaant tooooo..." as we leave them behind.

Agreed and not in conflict with anything I said.


Still far less blockrewards per hour than bitcoin and BCH price is also significantly lower than BTC price. Additionally miners must wait 100 blocks to spend coins which is quite a while at the moment. Big gamble.
So we're far from profitability.


Mine BTC while you're waiting. I don't think theres much competition as long as BCH mining remains unprofitable and ideologically motivated. ViaBTC has an agenda, obviously. And they do need competition or bcash will generally be perceived as the centralized failure it currently is.

That *might* happen, but it's disincentivized (capital requirements). If it *does* happen, it's not that big of a deal because you can simply route around such a node if it's misbehaving in some way. And most importantly: the system is not reliant on such hubs.


The p2p part of the system works every 10 minutes (for secure transactions). With LN, you can get secure transactions faster than that.

I'd say: Segwit will give us a little over 2x the capacity. We know that that any extra space will fill up quickly, regardless of the limit we set. It's better to increase scalability before increasing scale, but we compromised by doubling the blocksize regardless as we think it's safe enough in terms of scale and deployment and it acknowledges the technological progress happening in networking and computing.


... and this extends to any bitcoin core user, not just developers.


It's not so much taking over control ("core" hasn't any, really) but making people believe that their fork is the one they need to use to not lose money.


I honestly believe that politics are completely out of scope. The core project as a whole makes well informed, peer reviewed decisions based on the facts they collectively know to be true. They employ the scientific process. They won't give in when concerns remain unadressed, questions left unanswered and issues are being handwaved away.
**There's no virtue in trying to find the middle ground between sense and non-sense.**

If you don't upgrade, you're only not running a SegWit fullnode. You are still running a vanilla fullnode. You are still fully validating anything you care about, as defined by your choice of not upgrading.

What are you babbling on about.
SegWit *is* scaling up the network by more than **DOUBLING** its capacity. Period. If you think that's a drop in a bucket, than 4x or 8x should also be mostly meaningless to you as they're just a few drops more.
It's not the be all end all scaling solution and never was intended to be, that much is obvious (to most people). In terms of scaling, SegWit does two things: it's a significant one time bump and lays the ground work for layer two solutions like the Lightning Network.


This exposes a lot of idiocy on your part. You've been served grade-A bullshit and for some reason gobble it all up with a smile on your face.
"Core" doesn't *need* full blocks for anything. They're not a business. They're not trying to create a market for LN.
They're just aware of a simple fact that blocks will ALWAYS FILL UP. Whatever the (practical) limit is. When there's constantly a lot of free capacity, you can bet your ignorant ass that there's some dude somewhere figuring out a (probably non monetary) use case for that cheap extra space. Or another guy not giving a fuck about wether or not the implementation of his bitcoin using software is efficient, because "fuck it transactions are almost free anyway!"
The second thing which should be obvious to EVERYONE calling himself a bitcoiner is that we as bitcoin users need to pay fees in order to pay miners as the block subsidy halves again and again.
Great thing is, the blocksize that's known to be technically safe doesn't satisfy demand. So we don't even have to get into any politics. We can just follow the engineers. But of course some people simply want to get into the politics because they're politicians. They do that by claiming that vastly bigger blocks are perfectly safe, without ever backing up their claim.
You have no idea what you're talking about. You're deadweight slowing down bitcoin's progress by repeating these bullshit talking points.
It's that simple.

You mean their paymentchannels implementation? That alone is not really a scaling solution. It's a subset of the LN.
And to reiterate my point: Everyone is free to submit a pullrequest to bitcoin core. If your LN implementation is objectively better than Russell's it will be preferred (and Russell would probably continue working on that one).
Also if you have a real, complete alternative to LN, you can also submit a PR and it will be discussed and if it's objectively better, then LN will be dropped in favour of it.

@_date: 2016-06-11 05:40:25


Why? If you put up more money to fund all those channels, you will also be more expensive to use. Why can't I simply find a less expensive path and route around you?
Maybe in some cases that supernode offers the only route to your destination or is also the cheapest option, but with more and more LN users that scenario becomes less likely or at least there's some equilibrium there.
There's also the possibility of negative fees, which to be honest I haven't grasped fully yet, that would affect the viability of supernodes.

Payment channels (= basis for LN) were Satoshi's idea.
Interesting that you talk about religious devotion when in fact you are the one treating every word of Satoshi as holy scripture. We do not know what his preferred method of scaling would be today. Surely his opinions would have evolved in some way with new information coming in.
In any case, relying on big server farms is probably a bad idea (even if Satoshi thinks otherwise). It badly hurts decentralization and would open it up for additional attack vectors.

viabtc created an altcoin called "bitcoin cash" or "bcash" that shares transaction history with bitcoin up to a point, so everyone who owned bitcoin at that point suddenly also owned bcash tokens.
many, probably most, don't really care about bcash and are trying to sell their gifted bcash tokens for real bitcoin.
bcash blockchain has far less hashpower than bitcoin but inherited the same difficulty. instead of 6 blocks per hour they have one block every two hours (on average, until the next difficulty period).
to trade bcash tokens on e.g. ViaBTC's exchange, you need to have at least one confirmation.
yesterday there was a ~13 hour period without any blocks. so when the next block finally arrived, many people who were trying to sell bcash tokens but needed a confirmation got their confirmation and could finally dump their bcash tokens and the price reflected that. This repeated for a couple of blocks until most people who wanted to do that in this way at this time were able to do so.
Expect something similar to happen once bigger exchanges open bcash deposits and allow free trading. Just more brutal.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:42:27
bcash is ill-conceived and pointless. It just creates confusion for new comers ("Wait, I bought the *wrong* bitcoin? What are you talking about?"). It's not a real threat. It just complicates the bitcoin "brand".

The double spend own transactions issue I mentioned is also not a DoS attack. I'm not saying a 51% attack is nothing but a DoS attack. It is a DoS attack most prominently as this is the only feasible thing you can do. A chain reorg beyond 6 or even "only" 3 confirms is a whole lot more expensive and if identified as an attack would certainly not go unanswered. Technically possible, realistically not so much. And if it happens, we'll see countermeasures from the community, including devs.

Still having difficulties here. Let me just conclude with this:
Whatever is discussed on this sub or any other forum does not have a direct effect on the bitcoin ruleset. Changes only take effect once they're adopted by the majority of the network. This rule is also part of bitcoin. Artificial thresholds like 75% or 95% are only there to ease the process / prevent reorgs and are entirely optional.
Censoring discussion of such changes then doesn't make sense and it paints a picture of a very fragile bitcoin that has to be handled very carefully and shielded from outside influences. Quite contrary to the anti-fragile / honeybadger interpretation.
We should embrace openness and permissionless innovation. This includes open discussion about anything that relates to bitcoin. Anything that evolves the current codebase and builds upon the bitcoin blockchain falls well within scope.
I think it's quite obvious now that adding fuel to the fire by overeagerly censoring anything that doesn't fit the narrative made matters worse and contributed to the hostile climate.

@_date: 2017-01-22 08:19:33
Yes. Again: `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` is gone. It has been replaced by 3 constants of varying sizes (and units).
There is *a* constant that refers to what previously was the max block size, but the new max block size -- as in the amount of data, in bytes, being received, understood and sent by new nodes -- is 4MB.
@_date: 2016-06-05 07:40:12
A quite successful one.
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:26:30


The issue is that the blocksize is still 1mb, *from an old node's point of view*.
Any upgraded node will see, understand and propagate ~2mb blocks.
It *is* a blocksize increase for anyone who upgrades. It's *not* for anyone who doesn't.
It's the same as a 2mb hard-fork, except that it's way more friendly to people unwilling to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-01-29 07:12:15
They aren't. First of all, both are doable as soft-forks (at least to a degree). Second, if you need something that's impossible to do on the bitcoin blockchain (maybe that's the case with MW), you create a pegged sidechain.
And if that's also not an option, you hard fork the bitcoin blockchain. If that doesn't work because of lack of support, then your little altcoin wouldn't be successful anyway.
And if somebody still goes ahead and builds the perfect new blockchain from scratch, someone will fork it and make it somehow import the bitcoin status quo of who owns what.
There will never be a tabula rasa moment for a blockchain ledger of assets like bitcoin. Never. If it were to happen, that blockchain's existence would in itself a be very good reason not to trust any of them. Because for all you know, it could also be replaced in a couple of years for whatever reason.

SegWit initially didn't have a blocksize increase.
"Let's lower the blocklimit"-Luke of all people figured out that with SegWit, a blocklimit increase could be done as a soft fork, eliminating one of the major objections many people had against a blocksize increase.
The compromise was most definitely a 2MB-4MB version SegWit using his approach. One side got SegWit, the other a **doubling** of the blocklimit. Keep in mind that the guy who brought this option to light is in favour of a DECREASE of the blocklimit.
Then two years of misunderstanding, deliberate misinformation, greed and stupidity ensued and muddied the waters.

With the creation process being the miner simply saying "Hey guys, I'm just going to give myself 12.5 BTC here". And the network replying: "Since you found a block, we're OK with that. Go ahead."
And since the exchanges are part of that network and are also OK with that, you can sell your 12.5 BTC there for fiat.
Compare that to the creation process of fiat money, which is Banks saying "Hey guys, we're just going to create some money and lend that out for interest and there's nothing you can do about it." And society replying: "Well... uh... I guess that's normal? Oh look the Kardashians are on!"

I already acknowledged that and I don't see where the problem is. No one is saying LN doesn't require any on chain transactions. It just requires *far* less.


It should work if we assume that a) LN may become the normal modus operandi and all the funds you have in your hot wallet are always in one (or more) payment channels and b) it's no big deal if the wallet needs to reallocate funds to enable a larger transaction for example. Sure, that requires an on-chain transaction. And yes, that means some transactions still arent instant and require the usual x confirmations. So? If on the other hand 90% of your transactions are secure, instant and don't burden the blockchain, then that's still a great win.


Why? Can't you just send the money to an exchange via lightning? Or what do you mean by volatility risk?


Again, some on-chain transactions will of course remain. But assume that at least all your hot wallet money is always "tied up" in LN. Let's say you have 1 bitcoin available this way, but you need more. Can't you just sweep in your 1 btc paper wallet and let the LN software create another channel for you? Then if you wanna pay someone 1.5 bitcoin the wallet can use 1 bitcoin from the original channel and 0.5 bitcoin from the new one and send both to the recipient. Now you have 0.5 bitcoin left and available for instant lightning transactions.


Even if LN would only be okay for &lt;$100 transactions, it would be a huge win? I don't think it ends there once we have LN enabled hardware wallets. Even just with smartphones it's somewhat safe to handle a little more money this way. Right now I have $480 in the good old Android Bitcoin Wallet and I'm not really nervous about it.
Anyway... I think you're hung up on the "tied up" aspect. I don't think it will play out how you imagine it. I think it's a non-issue at least once LN is widely adopted. I could of course be completely wrong about any of this, but that's how I understand it currently.

There's an option to trust the network if you don't want to do the full sync and yes, that option is enabled by default. It's still an option.
You're trusting another source of information you have. E.g. maybe you did a full sync a year ago and remember that it was valid. Now on a new system and during a new sync you can skip a big part.


You don't have said option in this context. SPV and "trustless" don't go together.

On average, yes -- at least for another ~3.5 years.
We're currently a bit ahead of schedule at 1 block every ~9 minutes. At this rate miners mine 160 blocks a day which means ~2000 new bitcoins are currently minted per day.
In ~38 hours or so the next difficulty period starts and for a while the generation rate will again be 1 block every 10 minutes (1800 BTC/day) and gradually speed up or slow down depending on the hashrate.

I don't think that contradicts anything I said.
I'm understanding LN as an implementation detail of bitcoin itself. If all of bitcoin is eventually "tied up" in LN, none of it really is. In that scenario, making payments via LN would be the normal modus operandi. Sometimes you'd need to make on-chain transactions to rearrange channels, or you'd want to move some of your bitcoin into a cold wallet / vault of some kind. But generally speaking and with hopefully very smart wallets and clever routing it would all just be LN.

It's not really the same though, as old nodes can continue to use the network the way they used to. It doesn't matter that they can't validate the new rules, all they care about are the rules they know of. And those are still followed. Right now a lot of nodes could quite possibly be validating rules that you don't know of. Do you care?
There are indeed scenarios with soft forks where old nodes might end up in a situation where nobody wants to transact with them. Or where no miner will include their transactions. But that's not the case with this soft fork.
It's also quite OK to say, hey 95% consensus is enough and screw the remaining 5%. But you should be aware of the consequences and consider the possibility that you will at some time be part of the 5%.

@_date: 2017-08-03 05:14:07


No, I'm not suggesting that. You always look back 12 hours from the most recent block. Whenever that timeframe doesn't have at least 6 blocks in it, difficulty will be reduced by 20% (once). Then, when the next block is found it will check again and possibly adjust again (but only if there are less than 6 blocks in the new window).
This means whever you have a period of 12 hours without any blocks, the next 6 blocks will all reduce difficulty by 20% each, resulting in a total reduction of 73.7%.
After that it stops because there are 6 blocks in the 12 hour timeframe and will most likely continue to be until hashrate drops or miners deliberately stop mining for 12 hours. Doesn't seem like they're trying/able to continue this, though.
In any case. 1 block every 2 hours seems likely as there are no incentives for profit oriented miners to join at this point. Which means 3 months of slow blocks, then back to 6 per hour.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:48:42

This is why most of style criticism of SegWit is worthless. Any argument against a softfork is also an argument against a hardfork, by nature.
The only valid point (in principle) is that we can do a lot of things much cleaner in terms of code quality if we free ourselves from the constraint of backwards compatibility. This comes at a huge cost though, which is very ignorant about. Also, if clean code is at the top of your list, you should probably rewrite bitcoin from scratch while you're at it.

The reason we haven't seen a block in 11 hours is that miners are waiting for 12 hours, so that the next *six* blocks each decrease difficulty by 20% which means it will be down to 26% of the current difficulty.
It's possible that there will be another 12 hour pause after that the next 6 blocks. Which would bring down the difficulty again.
In that case the 1 block / 2 hours scenario won't come true, but this should give you an idea about how centralized bcash mining is.

It's *far* to early to tell.
People are generally lazy to upgrade, some pools have a sit back and wait approach and others have legitimate technical hurdles to overcome. It simply takes time. If you compare it to BIP66 adoption, it doesn't really look that bad, all things considered.
I agree that most if not all of the explicit opposition is irrational. If it turns out that a substantial number of miners do act irrationally, it would cast a very unflattering light on the whole bitcoin project. This would have consequences beyond bitcoin missing an important set of features.
If people oppose it for valid, well thought through reasons, then all is fine. If they oppose it out of spite and succeed in blocking the change, bitcoin will be far less appealing to an important group of users and developers. It will be perceived as a partially failed experiment to a lot of people. There will always be the thought of what could have been back in their head.

Late to the party, but I just want to point out to you that soft-forks definitely do not need consensus. Right now, there could be several soft-forks active in the wild and you wouldn't be the wiser, since soft-forks only add more rules and do not change existing ones. So they're fully transparent to "old nodes" (at least if they want to be).
The 95% rule is a network friendly, self-imposed rule by core. It is in no way mandatory for soft-forks.

I definitely don't want it to degrate into another In any case, permanently banning a user from posting and/or commenting in this sub should be a measure of last resort... it's the "capital punishment". I was once almost perma-banned because I cited a quote from involving his religion to point out a hypocrisy.

Why do you need to ask anyone? The code is open source and MIT licensed. Login to github, open the bitcoin repository, click "fork" and go ahead. Make your changes. Softfork, Hardfork -- whatever you like. The problem here is ofc that you need to convince people to run your code. There's a very simple reason that this seems so impossible to you that you feel the need to ask core to do it for you.

Because it's funny that ViaBTC is only looking for some useful idiots with the bitcoin unlimited schtick in @_date: 2016-12-10 19:13:08


In any case his 25% statement is closer to the truth right now. Anything above or below the red line is due to variance (which you brought up).


Irrelevant for his statement about the status quo.
As I said, I think that wether it's 25% or 30% or whatever is more or less meaningless at this point in time. And for that point, the fact that we're only one month into a year long activation timeframe is very much relevant. Also the fact that some mining pools already indicated support, but are not signalling due to technical difficulties (e.g. C++11 compatibility).
So he's right about 25%, he's wrong about that being a disastrous failure or something.
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:03:52
- F2Pool (~14%) currently cannot build C++11 (new requirement in 0.13.x) and is putting it on hold for a while. “Next spring, maybe.”
- BW Pool (~10 percent hash power) will eventually let individual miners decide.
- HaoBTC (~6 percent hash power) prefers a hard fork blocklimit increase, but doesn't seem to be opposed to SegWit.
- BTC.com (~5 percent hash power) will await further community consensus before considering to signal support.
- GBMiners (~3 percent hash power) said it would signal support, but doesn't yet.
- Bitcoin.com (~2 percent hash power) also awaiting further consensus before considering to signal.

I fully understand that.


Also understood.


Again, I fully understand that you must initially (or periodically) create a channel. I see this as "connecting" to the network. Once you are connected in this way, you can spend the amount of bitcoins you have in your hot (=LN enabled) wallet.
If at some point in the future virtually every wallet is a lightning enabled wallet, which automatically manages the channels for you, you can pay anyone instantly anytime. 
You don't need to close the channel once you received or sent your payment. You keep it open and route payments for others through that channel. Like you use other people's channels to route your money to the recipient of your choosing. Meaning you don't need a direct channel to the recipient. You could go over 10 hops using other people's channels.
You might need to close a channel if someone misbehaves. Or you might need to recreate a channel if you want to make a transaction larger then what your channel is able to handle. Ideally you won't have to micromanage any of that stuff like you don't manage your TCP packets manually.
It's bitcoin. Just that it doesn't commit every transaction to the chain, only the ones that are needed (e.g. to prevent fraud).
It's also bitcoin in the sense that payment channels are Satoshi's idea. Add routing on top and you essentially have the lightning network (yeah well Poon, Dryja, Russell and others fleshed it out a *little* bit, I guess :P).
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:56:26


Two on-chain transactions that can handle multiple lightning transactions that would normally each require a fee with vanilla bitcoin.
If you channel does 8 transactions before it closes you already reduced your bitcoin fee spending by 25%.
(Keep in mind that you're not only transacting with the peer you're opening a channel with.)

95% is meant to represent consensus as much as practically possible. So yes, with bitcoin there is no us vs them. It's just us bitcoin users (represented by miners), including all the people you may disagree with on a number of topics.

You were saying that not adopting SW makes sense on the grounds that it's a challenge to Bitcoin's immutability.
In my reply, I interpreted "Bitcoin" in two ways: the software and the ledger and claimed that the ledger's immutability is staying intact.
You expanded the concerns to supply, inflation and a general fear of unintended consequences and said that "the ability to achive consensus is a threat against all of these".
But you haven't yet shown how consensus on soft-forking changes can be a threat to supply or the immutability of bitcoin. (The possibility of unintended consequences is present for any change to the codebase.)
Along the way I claimed that a soft-fork cannot cause a network split, which wasn't specific enough. A soft-fork cannot cause a *permanent* network split, because the old rules consider blocks created under the new rules as valid. Without the 95% rule you could have a lot of reorgs, which of course should be avoided.


A rational market wouldn't have a reason to disagree, because they lose nothing (only miners need to beware). And with updating, you gain those cool enhancements.

You're right, but you're also wrong.
From an old node's perspective, the blocks are still 1MB. An old node simply doesn't care about anything that exceeds `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE`.
However, viewed from an upgraded node, the block has definitely increased in size. The SegWit block is bigger than 1MB and all additional bytes must also be transmitted over the wire.
Since after activation, bitcoin's rules and definitions have changed, it's perfectly valid to say that the maximum size a block can be has increased.


There is no `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` anymore. It has been renamed to `MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE` ([see here]( There are also two new constants called `MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE`(= **4MB**) and `MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT` (= 4000000).

So change the PoW function and render the expensive hardware the attacker uses as a weapon completely useless.
How many lines of code would developers need to change for that? Probably less than 20. Compare that to the several hundred million an attacker has to invest.
So even 51% can't do any serious damage. Best they can do is create an environment in which the entire community agrees that a hardfork is necessary.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:39:44
Blocks 478571, 478572, 478573 and 478574 reduced bcash's difficulty by 20% each. The next two blocks will do that, too. Then there's either another pause of 12 hours to repeat that process and further reduce difficulty or mining will simply continue normally and remain on that difficulty until the next period starts.
The 20% thing is unique to bcash and independent of normal difficulty adjustment periods.

If I lack a deeper understanding on a topic I find it often helpful to carefully listen to proponents/opponents and the way they argue. Their style and the tactics they employ.
Almost every post in has some anti core/blockstream spin on it. It's excessive and obvious. As is the vote manipulation and the hidden censorship. I suspect that Ver employs some of the more active accounts there, paying people to promote his propaganda. Also a lot of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Something something lightning hubs revenue. All that bullshit falls apart if you look at it even just a little bit closer.
Then one of the mods is behind  He is a known Ver employee and while it's unclear if he received money for "his work" on that twitter account or the segwit.club domain, he's obviously trying to influence public opinion on segwit and probably does so in his capacity as moderator as well. Perfectly in line with most of the team there.
The actions of other mods there speak for themselves as well. Trying to get banned from reddit for bullshit reasons, which was actually a successful attempt for a couple of days until some reddit employee finally had the time to look at the case. Maxwell was promptly unbanned. While he was gone, they immediately tried to get a hold of at least one of his [subreddits](
As for their motivations, I can't shake the feeling that half of is just throwing a temper tantrum. They got told "No!" with regards to blocksize and what to talk about in and they can't accept that. They don't get the attention they want (as Ver said on record). Looks like they want to sit at the grown up table, but don't have what it takes and get angry when it's pointed out to them. Can't take criticism. They doubled down on their ill conceived opinions, are stuck in their corner and get aggressive.
They also can't defend their ideas live in a debate. The whaleclub interviews with Ver or Janssen are somewhat embarrasing for them.

Short term bitcoin is immensely risky. Long term not so much, IMHO.
The biggest risk is a bug/exploit that leaves us with a messed up blockchain that seemed valid for a time, but actually wasn't. I don't think that's likely to happen and most other issues should be possible to fix with patches and updates. Even if we have to e.g. fix mining by changing the PoW algorithm for some reason, bitcoin would survive. It would take a massive hit price-wise, but recover eventually. As long as it works. And there will always be a version that does.
I always thought of bitcoin as an all-or-nothing kind of deal. And with every day that passes, the "nothing" scenario becomes less likely.

It really depends on what amount of money people will have in their hot wallets. With dedicated and secure hardware solutions that number might be far higher. And again, while not as secure, trusted execution environments like in android are protected against a lot of common attacks. People might feel comfortable keeping a lot more than $100 in their hot wallet (as I am).


I think that's a *very* conservative guess. If the routing part of lightning works well and wallets abstract a lot of the weird, hard to grasp concepts behind it away, that gain could be far higher.


Yes, you can't run LN on 1MB blocks. The napkin math they did on that resulted in 133mb blocks to serve a 7 billion users that open/close two channels per year. Now you say only 2 channels per year is ridiculously low. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. That depends very  much on details that aren't really clear today.

Under the premise that bitcoin is functioning (the majority adheres to the established rules), a soft-fork can not directly cause a permanent network split. Wether it is SegWit or not, a soft-fork only extends the ruleset and doesn't break previous rules. Therefore it's backwards compatible. Therefore it's unconditionally optional for everyone except miners. That means those who stand to lose something due to a soft-fork have the ability to vote on it. Those who can't vote directly can choose not to upgrade and won't be affected at all. Nothing is forced upon them. The rules of the bitcoin version of their choice are still honored.
You are only trying to distract from that truth. You can claim that I'm moving goal posts all you want, but that doesn't make it true.

I still don't understand where the issue is here.
1. Look at MTP of current block X.
2. Look at MTP of X-6.
3. If difference &gt; 12 hours (= less than 6 blocks have been found in those 12h) reduce difficulty by 20%
What I'm saying is simply: when there's a period of 12 hours where miners deliberately stop mining, the next six blocks are *guaranteed* to reduce the difficulty each by 20% resulting in a total reduction of 73.7% after those six blocks.
It's certainly possible that I'm misunderstanding something here or that I'm not accurately describing what I mean, but this seemed to be what happened on the bcash blockchain.
Now if theres another 12h timeframe at any point in which less than 6 blocks are found, difficulty will be reduced again by 20%. And so on. A 12 hour period of no blocks simply guarantees at least 6 consecutive 20% difficulty decreases. It makes sense to have that ASAP.

"An argument from authority, also called an appeal to authority, is a common type of argument which can be fallacious, **such as when an authority is cited on a topic outside their area of expertise or when the authority cited is not a true expert.**"
Are you arguing that the majority of active bitcoin developers are not experts? If not, then admit that it's not an appeal to authority when I point to them. It's also exactly my point. You have to admit that some people just know better than you. And unless you have very good reasons to assume they're dishonest, it's all you got. Your own opinion is worthless if you don't know what you're talking about.


Wether it really is 80% or 99% doesn't matter for my point. But try to name one developer, not miner, that's against SegWit in principle. Not just against the current soft-forking implementation, but truely against the changes that SegWit introduces, like malleability fixes, script versioning, linear scaling of sighash ops, capacity increase, increased security for P2SH multisig, reduced UTXO growth, ... Bonus points if he can explain his position without mentioning blockstream business models.


I'm not talking about the opinions of miners. Their decision process is mostly based on politics, as you can see [here]( Pointing to them for your argument is closer to an actual appeal to authority fallacy.

Even if you could get agreement on *what* to do, you'll never get agreement on a timeframe like that. If you think a soft-fork will take years, than you need to adjust your hard-fork expectations accordingly. Does the BU team even have a deployment plan? A hard fork within months from now would be very irresponsible -- to the degree that a lot of money is at stake. Which in this case would be a motivator not to act.


Why would the attack vector have vanished? Everyone agrees that the network can handle more than 1MB today (SegWit allows up to 4MB blocks), but there's a line somewhere. Even most pro-hardfork miners don't feel comfortable with blocks greater than 8MB.
Simply hoping for the best (aka noone will mine blocks the network can't handle) is a weak argument. Different parts of the network can handle different blocksizes. Will well-connected miners skip on potential profit to... well... keep their competition in business?

Let's just take a step back and recognize that this is fraud. It might be sanctioned (and more complicated) in case of fiat and central banks, but in any other context selling something that doesn't exist is fraud.
If I buy a bitcoin on coinbase, I sure as hell won't accept coinbase not actually holding that bitcoin for me as something that is normal, perfectly fine and common practice, really.
You wouldn't agree that it's more difficult for coinbase to run a fractional reserve and not get showered in lawsuits?

There have been many more examples of inflationary spirals than deflationary ones in history.

So far, so good.


I wouldn't call it "the fork", but there are two competing blocks alright.


But that question has already been answered, if we can assume that at least 51% of hashpower adheres to the newly established rules.
I argue that we can assume that, because it's essential to bitcoin as a whole. In this case the soft-forked chain will always win out eventually and everyone involved knows that.
If we can't assume that, the whole thing is not worth talking about because bitcoin is in a broken state. Within a broken bitcoin system, yes, forks are very much possible left and right. But the soft-fork is not the cause as you claim, &gt;51% not playing by the rules is. This can happen at any time.
You argument is that miners are deciding and forcing their decision onto everyone else and that this could backfire. There is not a single reason the rest of the network should be opposed to a value adding ("cool enhancements") soft fork, because for them **it is completely optional to upgrade**. Miners already use custom but compatible bitcoin builds with added rules and optimizations (e.g. ViaBTC's revolutionary "transaction accelerator" /s). This is nothing else. You're saying the network could throw a temper tantrum and act irrational. Sure. They also *could* migrate to and increase the market value of litecoin at any time (and they wouldn't care about scrypt). This is as relevant and as likely as your argument.
If I represented your views correctly above and you can't subscribe to my reasoning here, then we've finally reached a dead end.
So far we've been arguing wether a permanent fork is possible or not. You say it is possible, I say it's not if bitcoin's only requirement is met.
Let's throw all of that out of the window, assume it is possible and look again at the likelihood of it happening: is it still worth talking about? OTOH, if we categorically oppose every change: what are the opportunity costs involved and what's their threat value?
I think as long as past promises are not broken, noone is at risk of losing value (e.g. by losing access to coins or through increased inflation) and the ledger remains decentralized and immutable we're good. Hard-forks are a different beast and while not unthinkable and quite possibly necessary at some point, they should be avoided whenever possible.

No. Gold has value because people give it value for various reasons. Yes, these reasons include physical properties like weight, color, durability or conductivity. It also includes rarity. Or the expectation that it will retain the value people gave it in the past (speculation). Due to it's history it has simply become synonymous with value, almost like a meme. And for that reasons there's also demand for it as jewelry.
But it's not valueable because it's "real stuff you can touch", as opposed to bitcoin. If it's conductiveness suddenly doesn't matter anymore because the industry found a better alternative, it will lose value.
If people find a better way to store value (for example in a public, decentralized, immutable database) that doesn't require armored trucks and bank vaults, it will lose value.
If it loses too much value, people will at some point stop associate gold with value or wealth. Then demand for gold as jewelry will drop and it will further lose value.
On the other hand, Bitcoin and the blockchain are much more than a digital currency.

Wow, in your long winded response you're bending over backwards to avoid having to admit being wrong. And it's painfully obvious (e.g. not responding to points that are hard to argue with).
Your point is now essentially that *anything* can cause a network split, because miners can react to some event by forming a majority and do a hard-fork. You successfully recognized the risk that 51% can just ignore the rules and do whatever. Congratulations! Yup, that's bitcoin for ya.
If you're aiming to win this discussion on that basis, then don't bother any longer, I happily concede. But you know as much as I do that this is completely inconsequential for the viability of soft-forks and an all-in-all meaningless observation in the context of this discussion.

Do you feel that's something that has gone unnoticed by bitcoin / LN devs? You think anyone is saying: "yep, new people will have to wait a few months before they can transact"?
I think it's more likely that you're constructing the problem you want to argue against.
I mean who is saying that bitcoin will always be an over-capacity network? Isn't it more likely that we'll eventually end up with some form of flexcap / dynamic limit for the blocksize? I think bitcoin would work best if it's always near or at a self imposed blocksize limit that can be changed quickly and temporarily (at a cost, for miners) if need be. The permanent/default limit would adjust based on those temporary changes, but more slowly / averaged out over time to reflect real trends in transaction volume. Or something along those lines... or something wholly different. I'm pretty confident the people who invest *far* more time in it than I am and are much cleverer than me are on it. At least they have been so far, IMHO.

This remark and its style is quite revealing.
No, it is not wrong and I already told you why.
As long as the majority of miners satisfy bitcoin's only prerequisite (be honest / follow the rules), a soft-fork can not permanently split the network. If there is no such majority, bitcoin is defunct anyway.
A low threshold soft fork can cause reorg pain / loss of revenue for old version miners, but that's it. (And the 95% requirement takes care of that.)
Signalling leads to activation. Activation of a soft-fork means the bitcoin network adopted an additional set of rules (backwards compatible). If the majority becomes a minority again for whatever reason, that means there's no longer a majority following bitcoins newly established rules. Miners who signalled and activated the update are effectively hard-forking to a previous version, if they suddenly change their mind. Yes, hard-forks can cause permanent network splits.
I think you think that somehow activation doesn't count and the new rules are not *really* bitcoin rules. You're wrong about that.

And I agreed. In a financial system based on bitcoin, it's just way more risky for the bank doing it (and for the customer deciding to trust that bank).


Or.. *maybe*.. the concept of a fractional reserve bank is the issue here? Banks do things they can't afford and if anything goes wrong, they have everyone in the system bail them out. That's not a good thing in my book.


Just that every bank is in that system and that you need a bank or life gets a whole lot more difficult.


That's essentially what we're doing here, though. Isn't it?


I agree!


a) Here's my money. Please hold on to it for me and provide services like transactions, online banking, etc. I will pay for that.
b) Here's my money. Please gamble with it. If you squander it I will give you more money to keep you going. Oh and please also charge me fees for the services you provide.


I think the problems are laws that specifically allow fractional reserves. Because in lack of those, I'm pretty sure they'd be illegal by default. It's essentially fraud, isn't it?


They had to, because they gave out more gold redeemable notes than they had gold. A fractional reserve.
It's not at all clear that falling prices in a fundamentally deflationary system are bad. Instead of borrowing money to buy something *now*, you save your money and buy that thing when you can afford it. Instead of charging interest for lending out money to businesses, you do it for a stake in the company. In the current system, people are incentivized to be wasteful. In a system where holding your wealth (slowly) makes you richer by default, you tend to buy only what you need (or really, really want) and you probably will make the most of it.
Bitcoin is testing if something like that can work. We don't know. It's the inverse of the current system and we know that this one ultimately has to collapse.

Bitcoin trusts 51% of miners to be honest, they trust certain individuals/institutions to be honest (whitepaper mentions a "trusted timestamper").
So AFAICT it's not decentralized and not permissionless... and thus boring.

@_date: 2016-12-14 14:58:45


No, you're arguing that soft forking could result in miners deciding to hard-fork back to the now incompatible previous version. You then claim that this is the same, because "proximate cause, duh".
Not only that, you're arguing that there's risk of them doing so after the lock-in period of around two weeks when the soft-fork actually activates and the first soft-forked blocks are generated. Easily? Quickly? "Try again."
You also provide no plausible motivation for miners to do that. You only point to the market, but also fail to provide any argument why the market would oppose something that is optional, enhances bitcoin and does not have any negative impact for anyone (with the exception of miners needing to upgrade, but they already voted in favour). And you fail to show how this soft-fork is different from custom, modified bitcoin builds that already exist and are operated by various miners.
This is now officially just stupid.
@_date: 2016-12-12 06:45:55


I acknowledged that. But the 95% rule is there for that reason. This reduces the risk to a 1, maybe 2 block orphan. How do you expect a "strong market" to develop with 5% of hashpower (or &gt;3 hour block generation time for a couple of weeks).
The transactions included in an old, now invalid block will also be included in any new block which will also be valid for old nodes. The 5% hashpower will also build on top of that block.


I know that 100% consensus is a practical impossibility, but I also can't see into your head and immediately know what you mean.
I assume with "the right people" you mean those producing the blocks. In a soft fork context, they are the only people worth talking about, because for everyone else, everything stays the same (if they want it to). If all miners secretly activated SegWit two weeks ago, you could still do everything you did before. Short of analyzing the blocks on a technical level, you wouldn't even notice. Your contract with the bitcoin network has not been broken. I think this is important to acknowledge.
As for the miner's contract: if you consider unused bits and bytes marked for future use suddenly having a meaning consequential to the validity of a block is a breach of contract, then yes: the contract changed for them.
Changes through consensus are not bad. 95% is as much of a consensus we'll ever get and the fact that normal, non mining users are not included in this consensus metric is irrelevant because they're not affected by any changes enacted this way.
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:46:09
No he said "We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it."

People should also acknowledge that they sometimes don't know what they're talking about. It's fine, you can't be an expert on all topics. Why is this so hard to admit?
People who have spent at least an order of magnitude more time thinking about the topic are saying that SegWit is a good idea. Sure, there's no absolute consensus, but a vast majority of developers are onboard. Why do you side with the minority? Why do you think you're in a position to determine that 90% (or w/e) of bitcoin devs are wrong?

I'm going to acknowledge that I don't have the right background to really have this debate on a meaningful level. Other people can (and do) make better arguments more eloquently.
What I do have is the deep suspicion that contemporary economists are generally indoctrinated into the keynesian church and have trouble seriously considering anything that contradicts the seemingly fundamental truths they have sponged up.
I'm not saying the inverse of the current system is guaranteed to work, I'm saying that we don't know. And that it might work. Possibly even better and more sustainable than the rampant consumerism the current one incentivizes. Certainly worth exploring, which is what bitcoin does. Wherever that leads.
Regarding Japan, from Wikipedia:

Again, Trump quite obviously conned you into thinking he is doing it for the common people. He is not, he is tricking them to vote against their self interest. He is doing this whole thing exclusively for himself, only telling people what they want to hear.

IIRC frequent 1mb blocks (especially if maliciously crafted) would've been a real problem a couple of years ago.
So there was some catching up to actually be able to handle 1mb blocks reliably and making good on that implicit promise. With SegWit, devs say we should now be able to handle up to 4mb as a result of all those improvements over the past years.
Another reason the hardlimit remained constant is that a change would've required a hardfork pre SegWit.
Does that make sense?

His commit access was revoked in 2016 after a long period of inactivity.
Today, virtually all core developers do not have commit access. Only three maintainers do: Wladimir van der Laan, Marco Falke and Jonas Schnelli.
Not having commit access doesn't mean that you're "banned".
The Github repository itself is not even special in any way. It's just the one where the development currently happens. If maintainers abuse their priviliges, for example ignore good contributions simply because of the author's name, contributors will simply rally around another repository with new maintainers.

How is this solved by keeping the blocksize limit at 1MB?
@_date: 2015-08-28 07:47:57
It's either more money from more transactions with low fees or more money from less transactions with higher fees.
For an individual the former gets less expensive over time while the latter becomes increasingly expensive with growing user count.
Both paths will lead to an equilibrium between network security and fees. One centered around more mainstream usage, one around very exclusive usage between priviliged parties.

Yes. (And none of the current blocksize limit proposals allows for that to happen.)
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:43:38


Right now, yes. Not necessarily true in the future, though. That's what I hinted at by mentioning (UTXO-) snapshots.
Also the initial download is not really the issue when talking about bandwidth requirements of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:14:08


So Gavin's successful test results with 20 MB blocks are completely false? Did anyone show conclusively that &gt;1MB cannot work with the current client?


In case there is agreement that a future, upcoming blocklimit increase will be problematic, do we expect resistance from rational miners (which I presume supply the majority of hashrate)?
One could argue that big enough miners would oppose a reduction to gain market share over smaller miners incapable of handling the bigger blocks. Two points to considere here:
a) Does a miner / mining pool event want to gain &gt;50% (or whatever threshold is commonly perceived as problematic in the future)?
b) Any centralization this causes is temporary if we still retain some hard-cap, like Gavin's 8 GB limit.


True and even better.
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:37:34


Yes, 75%.


This implies a majority and in bitcoin, even a simple majority ultimately wins.


True, but noone is claiming that. Previous hard-forks also didn't have 100% consensus beforehand.


We increase the blocklimit, not the blocksize, yes. Or is your point that 75% of hashrate could try to bait and switch, causing a fork? What would be the rationale behind that? Donald Trump could buy plenty of hashrate and do all kinds of attacks tomorrow. What's your point?


Again, XT only raises the limit once 75% of hashrate declares support.


There is only serious controversy among a few developers. The argument mostly being "we shouldn't do that", not "we can't do that". Miners, exchanges and wallets are mostly pro blocklimit increase (but possibly don't really like the XT rebranding -- no data on that yet).

Well, B2X claims they have consensus and thus don't need replay protection. If you acknowledge that there's no consensus -- that it's controversial -- then you should at least acknowledge that it's completely irresponsible and even malicious to not provide replay protection.
And when you point to hashpower percentages (given the lack of consensus), then you yourself say that it's just a vote. Like in a democracy. Just that not everyone can vote and not every vote counts the same. Which is obviously worse.

r/btc doesn't like core and they're blindly against anything core puts forward or tries to accomplish.
In an effort to "fire core", they so far tried to push Bitcoin Classic, XT, Unlimited and now Cash. They couldn't make up their mind about SegWit2x. On one hand core was against it, so that was a big plus, on the other hand it had SegWit in it, which they fundamentally misunderstand (possibly on purpose) and thus heavily object to.

I know they're not part of the protocol, but they still make or break things like LN. If people can't legally run a LN node, because it would make them a money transmitter and they can't afford a license, the landscape changes a lot. So what does LN offer then? I slightly different way of doing Coinbase and Bitpay? Yes, my funds maybe safe in case of the service provider goes down -- but the chance of that happening to the bitpays, circles and coinbases is already very slim. Is LN in the end only eliminating that slim chance?
The licensed lightning network nodes, as attackable companies, could also be forced to not connect to the unlicensed ones? Splitting the whole thing up into a black and white network?
I think it's dangerous to introduce identifiable, attackable entities as a solution to bitcoins scalability problems.

The fees are whatever people are willing to pay as fees. Doubling the blocksize (again) won't really change that all that much. We need a reliable base layer onto which real scalability solutions can be developed, with trade-offs that are perfectly fine for $100 transactions.
If bitcoin currently can't provide what you need, you should use something else for your payments right now.
From an efficiency stand point, Bitcoin is hopelessly outgunned by centralized, controllable, censorable payment services like Paypal, VISA or Mastercard. But know that, as we speak, people are building stuff that tackles this head-on, without compromising on the decentralization / censorship resistant aspects of bitcoin.

Uhm, I wouldn't be so sure about that. Personally I think technical analysis is mostly a self fullfilling prophecy. The next bubble might start exactly because a critical mass of traders believe in a certain pattern (and believe other people will recognize and believe in it too).
It also may just be in the nature of bitcoin and it's price discovery to periodically cause bubbles of interest (and investment). Some dynamic that manifests itself in such patterns.

So it's just a general feeling? Also, we're not talking about 8 MB blocks, but an 8 MB hardlimit... since your point out yourself:


And continue with:


So the current limit may already be too high by your definition, yet somehow theres no campaign (with measurable momentum) to actually reduce the limit.


Maybe we would actually see a rise in capable nodes. The idea that necessity drives invention is quite popular on your side of the argument. Maybe it also drives investment if your company relies on a healthy network and piggybacking on hobbyists gets too risky.
And the argument that the number of fullnodes declines because of hardware requirements is based on anecdotal evidence at best and the decline is far better explained by other factors.

Logic isn't worth much if you start with a false premise.


Sellers of goods or services prefer to use a single currency over many. And this is what bitcoin will become: a global, day-to-day currency. It *kind of* is already, but it's not yet as good as it can be.
And while it's easy to clone the codebase, it's very hard to clone the network (and its effects).
Bootstrapping something like bitcoin is hard, that's why these forks even started to give away their forked coins for free (by cloning the bitcoin chainstate).
Listen, I have little interest in spoonfeeding you the stuff you should be perfectly able to figure out yourself if logic and critical thinking really is in your arsenal. Sorry for the hostility but at some point it just get's tedious hearing the same ill conceived opinions again and again.

This alone is nothing special, even in combination. Doing all that without any one party in control is the trick. This is what the buzz is about, wether people realize it or not. And of course this is where PoW and rewards come into play.

At best, it offers utility they could've had years ago.
Bitcoin comes around, catches them offguard. Knowing they can't win they claim to adopt "blockchain technology™", but not before redefining it into something controllable, less threatening. These redefined, permissioned blockchains are not the reason we're talking about this stuff today.

Why not both? Make DCA your baseline and buy additional BTC after a significant drop. It's reasonable to assume that this bull market will turn into a bear market at some point and looking back I think it's also reasonable to assume that we're overdue for a downward trend.
Then again, past performance is not indicative of future results. While I think it's reasonable to expect a major correction, I actually suspect that it's not going to happen anytime soon.
But I don't fucking know and buy BTC every two weeks. Everytime price drops by double digits percentage wise, I buy extra.

That's a bullshit argument against bitcoin.
Yes, Gold has value because the material itself is useful for some purposes, but to most people gold is valuable because this idea is so ingrained in our society. Because it always has been perceived valuable in the past and presumably always will be. That's why people want jewelry made out of the real thing and not some other material that's practically indistuingishable from it. So if we talk about gold's value today, there isn't really much behind it except the hivemind's idea that it's valuable.
Yes, Bitcoin doesn't have the 5000 year old history to fall back on, but that doesn't mean that there's nothing behind it. Bitcoin is a censorship resistant, global, open, permissionless ledger that no single person, company or government is in control of. Those traits are useful, unique and thus valuable. The network constantly produces more entries on that ledger, settling who owns what with no regards for jurisdictions, national borders or any other type of regulation.
Bitcoin is backed by those traits and the verifiable math that guarantees them.

It's hard to measure the level of support for rule changes. It's very easy to recognize the lack of consensus for them.

This aimed at the fact that the Lightning Network does not exist as a usable implementation, not even with alpha level quality and generally leaves many questions unanswered. Expecting full adoption by the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming months / year or two is, in my opinion, very optimistic if not delusional. Eventually it may or may not be a viable, accepted and adopted solution, we don't know. Betting on it is not a good idea.


Where? I mostly hear "we shouldn't do this" (because I have a more elegant idea) not "we can't do this". aluded to technical limits somewhere but if he or any other dev has actually **shown** that it's not possible, I missed that. Care to give some sources on that?


This depends heavily on your interpretation of decentralized. Is being able to run a fullnode on a raspberry pi or on a $20 VPS a minimum requirement?

Wait, the US government can seize bitcoin from let's say a swiss citizen? In any case, I don't think any developed democratic country will make serious moves against bitcoin. All they can do is slow it down, anyway.
Case in point: the internet. The idea that anyone could publish anything to everybody at practically no cost was equally controversial at the time. And like the internet did, the industry that's bootstrapping itself right now also has a huge economic potential.


Why, if whoever you're paying accepts bitcoin?


It's speculation in the sense that many people who buy or sell bitcoin don't really know what they're buying or selling. People who do their due dilligence buy and hold. They don't sell until the rest of the world catches up. Even then they won't sell for fiat, but use it to pay for stuff they want or need.
Bitcoin's value is very real, the long term price trend just reflects how many people realize this. Sure there are phases where people who don't really get it are all hyped up and get shaken out quickly whenever the price drops double digits percentage-wise. The price is volatile because the market is horribly uninformed.

If you think I was trying to argue that it is, you misunderstand my point.
With fiat you know for a fact that it's going to devalue, so it makes sense to borrow especially when interest rates are this low.
With bitcoin there's a chance that it devalues and a chance that it goes up significantly. In any case, if the price goes down you can react to that an minimize losses.

The reason bitcoin is slower and more expensive than traditional payment systems is because it is decentralized. It's not run by some specific company on dedicated high performance hardware in a data center. It's a peer to peer network without a central authority. This makes things very resilient but also orders of magnitute more complex if you want to get it right. Which we do.
This will never change. Distributed systems are always less efficient than their centralized counterparts. It will always be easier and more efficient to run something like Paypal on corporately owned, walled of, dedicated servers. 
However, bitcoin will close most of that efficiency gap through better technology while maintaining all properties that make bitcoin special. You won't find real game-changing innovation like that happening first on Litecoin, Monero, etc.

Blocks are bitcoins way of coordinating write access to its massively distributed database. You bundle your changes up into a block and write it to the database once it's your turn (as determined by a lottery). This is a solution to a problem the banks &amp; co don't really have. Why keep blocks if you don't mine?
The cryptographic principles applied to bitcoin can be applied to other systems as well.


Just because something can be used for a job doesn't mean it should be used for it. If you actually don't have half of the problems bitcoin solves, you can free yourself from the constraints these solutions impose.
I maintain, the Blockchain is interesting because of the decentralized, fully peer-to-peer aspect. This mandates PoW / mining. Everything else is, well, something else and is merely highjacking the term to jump on a bandwagon.

Doing this would probably heavily favor returning bitcoins as bitcoins from the trustees point of view. The exchange rate for the coins in question has been set to $483. He can either try to sell them for a higher price, or return them directly to creditors and reduce the liabilities by $483 per returned coin. Effectively selling those assets for $483/BTC when the market price is around $280.

To be fair, he probably doesn't know much about bitcoin personally. If he was involved at all it's more likely someone presented him with the idea of adding another payment method with no fees and he said "Yeah, sure."

Here's the kicker: For six years now, we have a functioning, global, distributed ledger. I think there is no reason that a future technology able to replace bitcoin will completely discard the ledger and start from scratch. And projects that try to do this for no good reason will fail to gain the necessary adoption. Also think about the precedence that this would set: it could happen to the new tech as well, so why go for it?

Overall, both are pretty much comparable today. If you're careless, you'll get compromised, regardless of OS.

If someone is casting a wide net, why bother with linux and it's [tiny]( market share (remind you, we're talking desktop here).
More attacks on windows doesn't necessarily mean that windows is less secure.

But it's not, and the reason is that while linux has it's strengths it also has a lot of flaws if it wants to be a mainstream, user friendly operating system.
And if I had to bet money on it, I'd say its more likely for windows to overcome it's security problems than for linux to overcome it's usability problems.

This is what I don't understand. XT **only** activates and diverges **if** it already has the vast majority (defined as 75%). In the second XT is active, it is the new Bitcoin by your definition. Until that point, it is identical to bitcoin. How is this considered an altcoin and compared to posts about peercoin etc?! Is 75% not enough? Would a change to e.g. 90% change the treatment of XT here?
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:33:17
Or take sipa's proposal, but start with 2mb to account for the improvements that already happened and will continue to happen in the next year until activation.
I think we can also safely bump the 17.7% a bit, since you can correct for overestimated bandwidth growth rates with a future soft-fork if necessary (opposed to underestimated growth via hard-fork). Maybe take a cisco or akamai forecast as basis.

There are also educated guesses by other developers and several miners (= the majority of hashrate) that see it differently.


The conservative option would be to continue to increase the limit when necessary, like it has been done in the past. The only thing different now is that we'll need a hardfork to further increase it, and those need to be prepared far in advance (and are increasingly difficulty and even impossible at some point). While it's not strictly necessary right now, theres a good chance that it will be in the near future as almost everyone is working towards a more useful and more used system. 
We can either be ready for the next wave of users and present them a reliable and cheap way of transacting on the internet or fail to do so. If the network shows weaknesses, Bitcoin will be presented in a bad light and not attract the number of new users it could have. Less users means less business interest, less investments, less decentralization... less everything. No, this won't kill bitcoin, but it could slow the development down quite a bit.
There *is* a whole lot of risk in not increasing the limit. Not doing so *is* a change. It's far too early to be talking about blockspace scarcity driving a fee market, like some do.

Can't find it.


Let's say you're a miner and you see 75% of your peers support the fork explicitly. Then take into account that you most likely don't have any real technical objections to it. You are for SW, arent' you? That's up to 4mb blocks. If you are against the blocklimit increase at this point, it's mostly about principle and IMHO misguided ideology. Do you then risk running your entire mining operation on an obsolete chain? How about the unknown % of miners among the remaining 25% who don't really have a strong objection to it or were in the process of switching already? Every increase of the majority will increase the incentive for everyone else to switch over, even if those have to do it grudgingly. This is not the kind of issue were you go all out to heroicly protect bitcoin from falling apart. It won't. And you know it. If we get to 75% we'll get to 99% within hours. Bitcoin CREATES consensus.
Do I know all that for sure? Of course not. Does anyone know anything about the future for sure? No. Does it tell alot if you hear Peter Todd of all people utter the words "there is some chance you're right"? Hell yes! ... I'm joking of course... 
^^^^But ^^^^it's ^^^^so ^^^^true!
All that being said, I don't agree with the 2mb hard fork. I personally don't think it's that dangerous but I'll always stay with core when in doubt. But if it happens, we might as well go with it, make the best out of it and enjoy the ride.

OK now you're all over the place.
The fact that a blocklimit increase is possible this way, doesn't mean that every type of change is possible this way. No, miner's cannot force the economy to hardfork if there is resistance. If there is no resistance, the change is not really that controversial to the economy. Again, the ecosystem gives them control and can take it away at any time, if need be. As long as the miners don't act against the interest of the economy at a whole, they're in control. If this change goes through it's proof that the vast majority of the ecosystem is in fact not against it.

Yes. I think core should always do what they believe is best for bitcoin.


No, but they give the the ecosystem the ability to choose. If the 2mb fork happens this way, core will adopt it and deal with the new reality. Any developer who is really considering to quit over this issue is poisonous anyway.


Price will not drop unless the properties of bitcoin change measurably for the worse. There may be traders trying to influence the market to make a profit, but that doesn't reflect on "miner's judgement". A real price drop would need a real reason, e.g. fullnode count dropping by half (or worse), an exploit made possible, etc.
And well.. you know bitcoin: price could drop by half and then triple again within a week.

Top right corner...
@_date: 2016-02-12 14:27:15
I'm just telling you how it is: if 75% want some specific change and are willing to risk a split, then they can go ahead. The only way to prevent that is to convincingly explain why it's against their own self interest as economically rational actors. If you can't do that (maybe it just isn't), then there's really no way to stop it. "Pretty please?" is not going to cut it.
For example: If 75% decide to rob the other 25% of their bitcoins, then they'd have a majority and could go ahead. But it's against their self interest, because if something like that is possible, it's also possible that the next time it is done, they're part of the 25%. Bitcoin would instantly lose a lot -- probably all of its value. So no one is ever going to do that.
@_date: 2016-02-16 10:37:26
Thing is, if 75% of hashpower is behind a proposal that affects them probably the most and the rest of the economy is only profiting from more throughput, I don't see much resistance at that point.
Miner's do control a lot, but they're on a (currently very loose) leash by the economic majority. If they act up, they will feel that leash, but this probably doesn't qualify as acting up.
@_date: 2016-02-24 07:23:25


The upsides I see are:
* Security when block subsidy is no longer enough (distant future and a lot can change until then)
* Spam filter (a very low minimum fee would be enough to achieve that)


No, I don't.


Very little positives (*currently*) and potentially huge opportunity costs.


See above.


And this non zero cost is constantly shrinking as technology progresses while bitcoin's limits stay more or less the same. And given that it's split among many nodes, it seems bearable? And I'm not arguing against fees, I'm arguing against fees that are higher than they need to be currently or becoming prohibitively high for any non-abusive use of the network.


I find this to be a *very* weak argument, especially when most of the time people argue in the next paragraph that bitcoin can never scale by merely keep increasing the blocklimit. There is *always* a lot of pressure to improve the system in various ways.


I agree -- if it's necessary in 25 years, then absolutely.

The minority chain is three times slower than the majority chain in finding new blocks until difficulty adjusts. I'm not good at math but I think that reduces the majority's risk of orphaning by far more than a factor of 3.

I was talking about linux as a desktop system specifically. And linux as a desktop system is less targeted primarily because of it's tiny market share and high percentage of expert users (that are harder to trick). If you want to target end-users, attacking linux is a waste of time.

Read the thread for context.


Yes, but SegWit (something almost everybody really wants) additionally increases bandwidth requirements beyond the hardlimit. 1MB -&gt; up to 4MB data, 2MB -&gt; up to 8MB data. In practical terms, SegWit will provide an effective blocksize of about 1.7MB. That's almost as good as a 2MB hardfork -- without going through the trouble and risks of hardforking.
I *suspect* that we would be fine with an 2MB hardlimit in addition to SegWit, since everything SegWit adds is opt-in, presumably used only by people who can handle up to a theoretical 8MB "block". But I can acknowledge that I'm no fucking expert and if the experts have concerns and still refuse to do it even when pressed, I eventually stop pretending to know better and go along. :)

"Sellers" are other users that buy items from your amazon wishlist for you in exchange for bitcoin.
You are saving 25% because they'll accept an expensive exchange rate and DO NOT make a profit. Why? Two main reasons:
- They want bitcoin and can't get it anywhere else cheaper.
- They have Amazon gift cards and want to turn them into bitcoins (and subsequently fiat, possibly).
Take [this reddit post]( for example (purse didn't exist back then). This is the need that purse.io satisfies.
Or [this business insider article](


Of course there's the stolen CC issue, but I'd argue that actually doesn't happen that often (or is somehow prevented either by purse or amazon). Why? Because purse.io still exists, after almost two years now.

I honestly believe this is a guarantee that bitcoin will not be replaced by something entirely new, ever. More precisely: any attempt at a "new bitcoin" will have to honor the original blockchain.

@_date: 2017-04-11 13:39:28
Before 2016 there was also a limit of 1MB. There is no new regime. You *could* argue that the old regime no longer works, but simply going from 5c to 50c/tx doesn't show that in any way. I'm sorry, but what bitcoin provides is simply not cheap. If transactions fees are low, you pay for it through inflation (which BU requires to always exist btw, so kiss your 21m limit goodbye).
Until we have a good replacement for the hard coded 1MB limit, there will be no change. BU's solution is not that replacement until you can proof that *that* new regime works. (It doesn't, so don't bother trying.)
But alas, core developers have figured out a way to actually increase blocksize to 2-3 MB on avg. without touching that hard coded limit (from an old nodes point of view).
But wait, there's more! With the subsequent Lightning Network we get microtransactions beyond what would've been possible with 5c/tx. LN transactions are not only much cheaper, they're also instant and *far* more secure than legacy zero conf bitcoin transactions. You can also use it for non-micro transactions!
So what exactly is your problem?

If people make false assumptions it's only their own fault. Bitcoin Core is an open source project driven by open technical discussion with one maintainer following a very clear policy about what get's merged and what doesn't. Good ideas are always welcomed, regardless of who puts it forward. But the bar is set very high.


I don't think that this is true. Again, IIRC it was made very clear. They simply can't speak for anyone but themselves as core is not a company or organization. The agreement also speaks of a hard fork *proposal* that the individuals present would make to the core project.

You can definitely not do that without trusting someone.

It's disingenuous to imply that a bitcoin network even with only 100 fullnodes in different jurisdictions across the globe is not still orders of magnitudes more censorship resistant than a VISA network operated by a single company with its headquarters in California.
Whatever satoshi did or did not see coming, his vision of bitcoin included fullnodes that run in datacenters and that this would be OK. This leaves Gavin more in line with Satoshi's original vision. And e.g. BIP101 doesn't even necessarily mean datacenters, only in case technological growth can't keep up.
There are decentralization hardliners in the development community and that can be a problem. The fact that they almost have a monopoly on technical knowhow makes this situation very difficult.

If we assume the "classic" hardfork activates by reaching 75% miner support only two things can happen:
1. everyone goes along because there isn't enough opposition within the ecosystem (or any at all) -&gt; the remaining 25% will quickly adopt the new rules -&gt; consensus
2. the miners made a bad call and there is significant opposition from users, exchanges, service providers, fullnodes -&gt; support will roll back (by force if necessary) -&gt; reorg to the longest valid (less than 1mb blocks) chain -&gt; consensus
I personally think that once 75% of hashpower thinks that the ecosystem will go with it, (2) is highly unlikely. (2) would mean they *really* dropped the ball.
If classic activates it's probably here to stay. In that case, no one in their ~~right~~ economically rational mind would stay with the 1mb chain. "Classic" is, at this point, the defacto bitcoin. Core will adopt the change by merging it in, effectively killing the classic brand and continue as usual -- just with a 2mb blocklimit.
But here's what I think will actually happen: Core will either do the hardfork themselves or put it on the roadmap. Problem essentially solved, because the whole ecosystem will now fully support core again.

If 75% or more of hashpower agrees and it doesn't affect me negatively as a user then no, it isn't (for me).
Let's say the 2mb fork activates. The remaining 25% of people that have no opinion, didn't get to it yet or are clear against the change will switch over pretty fast. No economically rational actor will stay with the minority chain very long, even if they don't like whats happening. So in the following hours after activation, consensus about the bitcoin rules will again be established by the network.
So what exactly is the damage done now? There really is none other than hurt egos. At the same time, bitcoin's capacity just has doubled and business goes on as usual (since we always increased the (soft-)limit when we got close in the past). No fee events, etc. Same course, just a technical difference.
Yes, fullnode count could drop (probably mostly as a form of protest). Will the numbers matter? Unlikely. There are diminishing returns to decentralization. Also, virtually everyone agrees that 2mb is safe.
Also you claim that it's not 75% of the economy. Do you have a concrete number (or even a way of measuring it)?

So you don't care about consensus, you care about hashpower majority vote? How is this a good process when the supermajority of hashpower is controlled by less than 5 guys? Do you actually want those few people to have full control over bitcoin changes?
Nakamoto consensus in particular doesn't apply here, as we're talking about rule changes and those are out of scope.
Also, 75% hashpower support is a bit misleading when ViaBTC and BTC.TOP (currently &gt;26%) do write "NYA" into their blocks, but at the same time publicly stated that they a) have not received user request to run 2x b) will let users decide and/or mine the most profitable chain. ([source](
With the 85% BTC / 15% B2X split on various futures markets and online polls in mind and considering the opposition by developers, users and meetup groups -- I think the support for this thing is highly overestimated.
Edit: Actually on bitfinex a B2X token is valued at less than 0.12 BTC right now. It keeps dropping and the signalling hashpower with it.

It doesn't try to hide the fact that miners determine the blocksize (like BU does). That's still bad, though.
@_date: 2017-04-04 05:55:24
In 8 years it's already well below 1%. The lower the inflation rate, the lower the cost to produce a block (according to Rizun). As inflation rate gets lower and lower, blocks get bigger and bigger as demand for cheap / almost free transactions is unbounded. That puts fullnodes under pressure and those nodes are not incentivized like mining is. This means less and less voluntary non-mining fullnodes.
Now BU supporters like to quote Satoshi who said that only miners would need to run fullnodes in the long term. What they usually skip is that Satoshi also warned against a possible attack which he says can be defended against by using SPV. But the SPV as described in the whitepaper doesn't exist, so we currently don't have a defense against that attack. With that in mind, it's not safe to turn off fullnodes, as that would give miners complete control over bitcoin. Which is of course not a *real* problem if you believe they control it anyway ("longest/most PoW chain always wins"). But that's demonstrably wrong.

Miners are essentially employed by the rest of the ecosystem. If they misbehave, they can get fired. It's in their interest to give the network what it wants (and can bear).
If they reach a 75% majority on some decision and their position is actually against the interest of the economic majority, they screwed up and will feel it.
Hashing power is the only real voting mechanism we have and IMHO it's good enough, since the interests of investors, service providers and users are expressed within (Miners are all of the above). E.g.: if you think miners could some day just use their power to double the block subsidy / bitcoin supply, you're very wrong. That's why I don't buy the "two wolves and a lamb deciding whats for lunch" argument. It's very nearsighted.

Yes, we're only talking about probabilities here.
With the 75/25 split, there's a ~90% chance that the new chain will increase it's lead over the old, thus making it less likely for it to overtake the new. I don't see how it's not virtually zero after *weeks* under those conditions.
Yes, if you want to move the goal post and talk about varying hashrate splits then that's another discussion. In the context of your original posts though it's wrong to say new-chain miner's will get orphaned "10% of the time". Don't you agree?
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:38:08
95% rule for block signalling is merely a tool to make an upgrade as frictionless and safe as possible.
Miner's job is to signal readiness. This is not a vote.
If they don't play along, we don't necessarily need that 95% rule.
Proof of work is a tool to guarantee that blocks will only be generated roughly every 10 minutes, it's a way to coordinate write access to the blockchain so that we massively reduce the chance of collisions. Since you get a reward for a block, people will invest money up to that reward to get it. This makes the blockchain hard to modify and ultimately bitcoin safer.

So it's less than 10% for the second miner, but surely that's now also true for the first miner who continues to mine the chain? Ergo the chance of subsequently getting orphaned is reduced with every block that the new chain gets ahead of the old. After two hours of no orphaning (new chain has produced 9 blocks, on average, old chain only 3) the chance of getting orphaned from this point on is neglible in any reasonable timeframe?

OK, maybe I'm being dumb, but you start your simulation with the new chain being one block ahead of the old one. Since the new chain produces blocks three times faster than the old one, the chance of the old chain overtaking the new chain fall rapidly.
If you start with old=1 and new=3 the chances of the old chain still overtaking the new chain are reduced to ~3.7%.
At old=2 and new=6 the chances are ~0.4%.
So there's *some* risk in the first hour or two, after that it's virtually zero?

If you think there will at some point be billions of users using bitcoin the way you do now, then I'd say you're horribly mistaken. Bitcoin already suceeded, but if it continues to succeed, there will at some point be billions of users that use something that under the hood uses bitcoin at some level.
BTW: The risk of bitcoin being overtaken by stuff like e.g. Dash is almost non-existent. Every cryptocurrency that offers the same as bitcoin will run into the same problems, but with a development team that is very likely less capable of actually solving these.
In any case, if at some point bitcoin (as *the* value token) is getting replaced by some other cryptocurrency, new genesis block and all, that would simply undermine cryptocurrencies as a whole. Once you establish that a cryptocurrency can completely replace another, there's no point in investing in any of them because it could happen again and again. The store of value appeal would be completely gone.
Bitcoin could be replaced by another crypto that honors the original blockchain, but that would just be an evolution of bitcoin / a hard fork.


The demand for *free* transactions definitely is. The demand for *very cheap* transactions is perhaps not unbounded but far beyond what even "unlimited" bitcoin can cope with in a decentralized matter.


BU is a reckless experiment of unproven and partially disproven ideas... directly on mainnet. It's badly tested code as evidenced by recent events. Anyone who considers this a viable option is a) unqualified, b) heavily misinformed/ignorant or c) malicious.
We are no where near the need to buy time at the price BU is setting. SegWit *more than doubles* the capacity. Schnorr signatures will improve capacity by additional 30% or so. That's all the time we need to get LN started, which would offload a ton of transactions onto Layer 2, thus making room in Layer 1.
There is also no need to agree on LN. Don't use it if you don't want to. I don't know why you wouldn't (probably due to misunderstandings) but hey -- your choice. Even if you don't use it, you'll benefit from it (same with SegWit).


That's good to hear.


Technically, they're supposed to signal their readiness and we're polite enough to wait until they do. If they don't signal because they're having trouble getting ready then that's fine and we will all work together to solve the issues or find another way of doing something. If they don't signal because they don't *want* a certain change, then it gets dangerous for them for the reasons you outlined. PoW change only comes into play if miners start to outright attack the valid chain with their hardware.
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:34:24
So if 51% of miners decide to double block reward tomorrow, you would go along because "POW rules"? Your fullnode would definitely not, until you apply a patch from the miners. More importantly: the fullnodes of exchanges and merchants and end users wouldn't until they as well apply that patch. Which they most likely wouldn't because it's against their self interest. So who makes the rules again?

Yes and no:
Yes, if you want to be able to independently and fully verify that no one is messing with bitcoin.
No, if *some* verification is good enough for you and you trust others to do the rest.
The more people use bitcoin core (or any other so called "full node" -- full as in fully verifying), the better. But there are diminishing returns of adding additional fullnodes to the network. Adding a second or third node to do full verification of everything is incredibly valuable. Adding the 100,000th full node not that much.
The chart refers to the blocks created by miners and the software they use to do that. Recently some miners switched to Bitcoin Unlimited which tries to alter the protocol in dangerous ways and is thus very controversial. My guess is that we'll soon see those miners switch back as Bitcoin Unlimited is a failing attempt at altering bitcoin.

And since said work takes about 10 minutes to complete, it prevents people from writing to the chain all at once.
Proof of work alone doesn't create consensus.
The fact that the work is costly means the chain is hard to fake. There's one easily identifiable true chain and if you want to append to it you have to do work. Thus, it's valuable (if people *want* to append to it).


Non sequitur.


10 minutes is the preconfigured target. How hard proof of work is depends also on the amount of hashpower deployed. But sure, if we suddenly want to target 5 minutes, we'd need to double the difficulty. But the target is usually rather static.


I don't understand what you mean by that. The 10 minute interval prevents most write collisions. Sometimes it doesn't and then a block gets orphaned.

The average user will continue to use third party services / web wallets for years to come. So for them, all of this stuff is out of sight anyway. The blockchain.infos and coinbases will use SQL for internal, and LN &amp; on-chain for external transactions. The latter only up to some amount X, after which you'd have to use and pay for an on-chain transaction. Maybe you pay the fee in full, maybe coinbase does or there will be some other model.
As the bitcoin industry and their security practices mature and plenty of not-so-tech-savvy users join in, this is far safer anyway. Yes, those users won't be directly in control of their coins, but that's also true for the hacker who would otherwise penetrate their system via malware infected adware the user installed alongside some "freeware PC performance booster" etc.
The real important thing is that bitcoin introduces a new base layer that is open and permissionless and that you can choose to interact with at any time, circumventing third parties whenever you feel qualified and confident enough.
In the future when provably secure hardware wallets are abundant this might shift a little. But even then many people would want to have someone secure their money for them. Especially if they can get guarantees / insurance.

This ignores the fact that mining like this *replaces* for-profit mining. Also unclear is the level of transaction fees in a scenario like this. If a billion devices use bitcoin regularly, even with LN and such, we can assume that fees make up a much more of the reward than today. You criticism is very short sighted.


I disagree. Your reasoning why it presumable is and always will be a stupid idea disregards a lot of different aspects. If you categorically dismiss or ignore anything that could work in favour of the idea, then of course you end up with a scenario where it is in fact a stupid idea. Wether or not that has anything to do with reality remains to be seen.
E.g. I don't understand why you think that if a device has to communicate to another device and identify itself (automatically) as the owner of an address, that this is the same thing as a human, manually signing up at paypal and possibly having to identify himself with an address, credit card, bank account or even photo id.
"Either way, the sending device must identify itself to the 21inc server." -&gt; "*See it's all a stupid idea!*". No, I don't see.
I do however completely acknowledge the possibility that this thing simply won't work out for various reasons. You don't seem to do the same the other way round. This always makes me very sceptical of the person making that argument.

Yes technically you generate shares, not bitcoin directly. Yes that requires a pool. No, you don't necessarily need to actively claim your bitcoin, they can be delivered to you via payment channel as a continous stream of bitcoin via "buffered pool mining". In any case, no human interaction required. No human identity. Can't see how you want to compare that to PayPal.


Currently this is of course correct. I'm not talking about today, though. (Think Payment Channels / Lightning Network.)


Device has mining chip embedded (or within its charger) and the ability to automatically generate payments with the mined bitcoin. Let's say it's a smartphone. User opens browser, navigates to wall street journal and clicks on an interesting article. Server responds with `402 Payment Required`, the browser asks for your permission to send a payment of $.50 worth of bitcoin. The UI also provides an option to setup rules for Wallstreet Journal. You decide you don't want to be bothered with payment confirmations and assign a budget of e.g. 25% of the devices income for WSJ, so any payment request within that budget is automatically sent by the browser when you click on a link requiring payment.


Some people do. Other's don't know how or don't have the equipment or simply don't want to and pay for the convenience of not having to deal with chickens in order to get their breakfast egg. Most people have power and internet at home, though. Whats your point?

You think when fiat-wealthy people who want to preserve their wealth flock in, people that are bitcoin-wealthy will cash out big time?
When price increases, some whales will cash out *some* of their BTC to buy cars, houses and/or boats. I think very few long time holders will sell just to hold fiat.
But that doesn't mean bitcoin can't 10x again until they do. Remember that whenever they price increases sharply, they have to cash out less of their BTC to buy that house.

PayPal is a service for *people* with identities, bank accounts, credit cards, billing addresses. A device doing a handshake with another device doesn't require anything like that. Most importantly, it doesn't require any human interaction. In theory 21inc could be replaced with something like P2Pool, but I understand that this has, at least currently, a myriad of problems of it's own (so don't bother).


If you think that, then your understanding of LN is deeply flawed. (E.g. why should the device close a channel to pay a micropaid service?)


Oh, that's the reason? Not the fact that mining chip development has caught up with the state of the art?


What if we get to the point where the majority of hashpower isn't even mining for profit? If a billion smartphone (chargers) have a 50gh/s mining chip we'd be at 50 times the current hashrate. If those people don't really care about mining bitcoin, but the convenience it provides in form of micropayments / adfree browsing / etc., bitcoin mining would be a drastically different landscape. Even the biggest, chinisiest mine could only operate at a loss.

OK, I did a poor job at conveying that point, which is that miners that are not mining for profit displace miners who are. So if 1500 new petahashes join the network, we wouldn't be at 3000 for long. For profit mines which are no longer profitable just shut down.
If you can't mine for profit, but there's still reason to mine, a lot of your assumptions go right out of the window.


Revenue is not fixed. Yes, fees are *currently* insignificant compared to the subsidy, but this will have to change.


I never once mentioned that the bitcoin price plays any important role in and of itself here.


Autonomy, not necessarily anonymity. The device does not need an identifiable owner, just the resources to operate.


In principle, why not. Botnets are popular. Bitcoin just streamlines that process with its mining and proof of work. You'd have a lot of technical issues in the details when selling generalized CPU power. Bitcoin also lifts the dependency on a specific vendor. Sure, early attempts might involve a fixed/hardcoded pool. But buffered mining could also be provided as a service, where the service provider pays out a little less then what he mines, but in a steady stream. (Might not make sense in the context of for profit mining, but that's not what we'd be doing.)
Another thing that wasn't mentioned before: a couple bucks each month may be all you need, because prices for paywalled content will drop if conversion rates increase, which they would if the process is mostly automated.

Let's say a monkey is predicting local highs and lows for you to trade on. If it's a truly random process he should be right 50% of the time.
If using TA makes you right 55% of the time, it already is very valuable in the long run.
Given the fact that price movements are not a purely random process, it's conceivable that TA has some amount of predictive capabilities. It never claims that something is going to happen for sure, it merely says that one scenario has a higher probability than other scenarios, e.g. it's more likely for bitcoin to stay within a +/-20% channel than it is for it to drop to absolute zero tomorrow. If you agree, you're kind of using TA already :)
Traders (or humans generally) often tend to think alike. TA is exploiting that in a self fulfilling prophecy kind of way.

This is a very poor attempt to try to defend your weak position.


I'm not advertising or defending a scam. Full stop. I'm sorry, but the fact that they could *potentially* steal people's fork coins doesn't make them a scam. The fact that you fully equate the two however says something about you.
It's great that you're sceptical and careful, you should be. But that doesn't automatically make them thiefs.


I'm not saying you should trust them with anything else then a **fully emptied bitcoin wallet seed**.
*THEY* say the same, right at the top of the page. In caps. If you do it regardless, you're a) stupid and b) lucky, because so far it doesn't seem that they would take advantage of that.


Like the other one that asks you to run a closed source .exe file? Even if it was open source, most people wouldn't be able to verify for themselves that it works as advertised and would need to trust someone. And even if some developer reviews it, they could change the binaries at some point.
The only safe way to do it is to compile the forked bitcoind from source and make changes where necessary. Not many would be able to do that.
So at the end of the day, you probably trust them only with the fork coins you wouldn't be able to access otherwise. You're not trusting them with **any** bitcoin. If you do, you're doing it wrong.

Because, in my opinion, enabling consumer oriented devices to do meaningful, paid-for work, completely autonomously just by providing them with electricity and network access can be quite powerful.
It's a vision for a future where at least these two conditions are met: 1) mining chip efficiency increases at a much slower and more predictable pace and 2) bitcoin price is far less volatile than today
I just find it annoying that criticisms almost always seem to ignore key parts of the whole vision, the assumptions prononents of these ideas make. We know it won't work if those requirements are not met, stop pointing that out, thank you. A lot of strawman arguments.


The envisioned embedded mining _**is not for-profit mining**_. These devices are just supposed to convert electricity into bitcoin. A completely frictionless way of purchasing bitcoin at more or less market price. No sign ups, no credit cards or bank accounts, no account management, nothing. Economies of scale don't matter if profit is not what you're after. People who would buy and run these things want convenience. They'll get the stuff microtransactions can enable, they only need to charge the device and provide an internet connection. Now they get access to some otherwise paywalled content, don't see ads, etc.
How many smartphones, tablets, laptop, desktops are out there? How many will be in 10 years? Now imagine a significant portion of those having a petty cash wallet, willing to spend $5 or so, each month.

If users decide to go with SegWit2x that means users decide to leave the core development team. Period. If you think this is anything else you're deluding yourself.
I'm not going to say "all", but many core devs would not be interested in chasing the users. If users want something different than what they're providing, then they would ultimately be ok with that, but the consequence would be that there are irreconcilable differences in how things should evolve. Many core devs would either just continue to work on the legacy fork or, if that's really pointless, simply close that chapter and move on to different things.
This is not a game of chicken with two cars about to drive into each other. This is one car driving into a wall of integrity. Those cypherpunks are not bluffing.
In any case, if the SegWit2x coup is successful and the current dev team draws the consequences, I will completely liquidate my bitcoin position until things get back on track, if ever. I'm pretty sure many many people will feel the same, because in part we invested our money in the core project and the people behind it, not just bitcoin.

That would require some sort of contract, payment method, identity, etc.




Implementation detail that only becomes an issue in the context of trust. Since there's little at stake at $5/month, it's really just a technical detail. LN or any other form of microtransaction support would make things easier.


Computer scientists and entrepreneurs have also been trying to get a workable decentralized consensus mechanism to work for the last 30 years or more.


Microtransactions are desirable not because the buyer can save a few pennies, they are desirable from the seller's point of view because they entice people to spend money. YES, they're inconvenient and this is *exactly* what they're trying to change. We do agree that a system that allows people to spend very small amounts of money across different content or service providers, without the need to manually pre load an account, or even sign up or identify would be quite valuable, yes?


Sigh. The miner only needs to be where the resources it needs to function are available, that is near a power socket and an internet connection.

And where exactly is the technical problem here?


Micropayments do not work with bitcoin as we know it today. I already acknowledged that. Pointing that out again is... pointless. LN, or something like it, is a prerequisite.


You're essentially repeating my post here and I don't really see a huge problem. Yes the UI will ask the user, yes the user may define rules/budgets. Sensible presets, easily customizable within a good UI will make all of that practical.
It's an ambitious idea and there are a lot of open questions, unsolved problems, but still: it's conceivable that something along those lines can work. It's worth a try and they're trying.


When 21 launched the chip, it mined ~$3 per month. Now it's a third of that. Again (as I said before): increased mining chip lifecycles is another prerequisite. Since development is already slowing down and will only continue to do so, that's mostly a matter of time.

~~I guess that means people who had BTC on gox can expect 15-20% back. Probably a little less.~~
If I understand correctly:
- USD/JPY claimants get paid back in full.
- BTC claimants get $470 per BTC back.
- 165k BTC remain and will likely go to Karpeles (who doesn't really want any of it).
- It's not unlikely that the remaining BTC will end up being distributed to BTC claimants.
- I think around ~800k BTC were claimed &amp; approved. So if BTC is given back to creditors, they can expect around 20%, probably a little less.
It's also conceivable that they try the bitfinex model, relaunch MtGox and try to pay back the remaining BTC creditors over time.
If authorities actually manage to recover the stolen BTC, it's almost guaranteed that someone will try to relaunch MtGox.
No chance in hell that Karpeles has any executive role in that, though.

According to japanese law, most of it will go to Mark Karpelès. What he decides to do with that is technically his business. But I would honestly be surprised if he just disappears with it. I think he has the intention to distribute it among creditors.

Wladimir van der Laan, the bitcoin core maintainer, will NOT merge 2x. He literally can't, because a) there is no sound justification for it, b) there are many unaddressed concerns and c) literally every contributing developer is very vocally against it.
You fully need to accept that simple fact right now:
**Bitcoin Core will *not* merge 2x, because it's simply not an option.**
(Repeat it a few times in your head if you need to.)
Many CEOs that signed the agreement did so in order to *prevent* a chain split. Now the agreement will be the cause for one if they follow through with it. It's guaranteed to cause a split, as the core implementation will not be compatible with 2x.
I also think most of the signees are not comfortable replacing dozens of highly skilled and motivated core developers with Garzik &amp; friends. That's what activating SegWit2x would actually accomplish.
And I'm absolutely certain the bitcoin users which those companies unsolicitedly are trying to represent here do NOT want to "fire core".
SegWit2x will most likely not happen, and if it does, it will fail miserably.

Even if that was the plan all along, which I heavily doubt, I would be totally okay with it, given the spurious way SegWit was blocked by a few individuals for over a fucking year.
First it was unacceptable on technical grounds, then as soon as they saw a chance to get what they want, all those objections suddenly vanished and they agreed to "compromise".
Making deals in order to get what you want into bitcoin is not how it's going to be.
A few people meeting in a hotel and agreeing to push something through is not how it's going to be.
If your business can use Bitcoin to its benefit, then good for you. But don't get the idea that Bitcoin has any obligation to help your businesses succeed.
And even ignoring all that, the NYA wasn't detailed enough to seriously bind anyone to it anyway.
SegWit2x serves only one purpose: it let's certain parties continue to play the victim. "Core betrayed us!!!!" Pathetic.

No, but with 2x it would be. You shouldn't have any illusions about that.


99% of actual bitcoin development happens within the core project. If the contributing developers who make up that project stop working on bitcoin I don't think it will take long before bitcoin stops working alltogether. (Unless the new maintainers leave the codebase untouched.)


And then what? They implement the things that the vast majority of experts heavily object to. Leaving several concerns unaddressed, because a few CEOs decided that's the way to go. Great new governance model!


Let me tell you: assuming anything else is wishful thinking. Cypherpunks are a principled bunch.


It's not about the actual parameter. It's about the way we come to a decision wether or not to change it. That seemingly small change if successfully pushed through will completely poison the well.
The question is, does the Digital Currency Group together with Bitmain have enough resources to trick people into handing over control to them? I hope not. If they do, then bitcoin will be fucked up beyond all recognition to an essential group of people and an even larger group of non-essential ones, including me.
These are the realities wether or not you accept them. It's in your own best interest to fully understand the situation here.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:01:11


No there actually isn't! I think, in part, this comes down to a misconception that many people have about what "core" is.
"Controlled by core" means controlled by an idea / process that many otherwise mostly unrelated software developers share, which is more or less that
a) changes to bitcoin need to be well thought out (rationale, trade-offs, adversarial thinking) and
b) there needs to be rough consensus among all developers (meaning all concerns must be sufficiently addressed).
The issue with SegWit2x is that [all]( active bitcoin core contributors that have come forward are against it (and similar hardfork blocksize inreases). These are the experts here. These are the people we should listen to when it comes to stuff like this. They *do* know better than you and me. Core doesn't reject SegWit2x because they don't like who is proposing it. Core rejects it because it neither meets requirement (a) nor (b).
The reason btc1/bitcoin (and bcash and classic and XT and unlimited) exist is that some people simply can't accept a "No".
The NYA tries to override this process in the name of compromise. While a lot of signees bought into it on those grounds, I do think the initiators of this do have the agenda of replacing core with a team they can control.
But even compromise as the key driver would be ill conceived. Bitcoin doesn't do a compromise for the sake compromise. It's not a good thing for the network, especially if it's the middleground between sense and non-sense. "I have zero bitcoins and you have 100 bitcoins that I want to myself. Let's compromise in that you give me 50 right now."
They key difference between control by open source software developers vs. control by a corporate alliance is the former will ask "what's best for the system as a whole?" and the latter "what's best for *us* right now?" The former will follow principles, the latter will chase profits.


It's easy to make fun of when he proposes to further limit the blocksize. But he does have a point. We are currently borrowing from future technological growth. Right now, bitcoin would be better off if blocks were smaller. That's in direct opposition to the get rich quick expectation of many bitcoin holders, though.
4 MB blocks on average also means up to 8 MB blocks every 10 minutes if someone tries to attack the network. Research suggest that if you consistently have 4MB or larger blocks, it will have a quite significant effect on the number of full nodes.
So no, I don't think that's what the broad agreement would be.


You really should re-evaluate, keeping in mind what a devastating effect a corporate takeover would have if this interpretation is closer to reality. There's a lot at stake, make sure you looked at it from all sides and fully understand the situation.

The way I understand Charlie's quote I don't think that the $500,000 was spend exclusively on miners. He was spending that amount per month at the time to "do whatever he wants" and some of it went to miners to prop up BU. I don't see any sign that Roger Ver is any less emotional and irrational now than he was a couple months ago.


Sure, but we do know what he is capable of and willing to do with his fortune.
If you're trying to make the point that yes, with BU he played "a little" dirty, but now with Bcash he's totally not astroturfing because he had a change of heart on these things... then... I don't know... we probably have incompatible definitions of 'critical thinking'.
I understand that we don't have conclusive proof here, but I also can't be 100% certain that I'd fall to my death if I leave the building head first through the fifth floor window. There are just plenty of reasons to make that assumption.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:45:59
I guess deep down he thinks along the lines of "the ends justify the means". E.g.: it's OK to trick a few people into shitty mining contracts if that increases hashrate under his control.

Satoshi's original vision doesn't determine what is technically possible today. Things Satoshi thought to be true don't necessarily turn out to be true. E.g. fraud proofs for SPV clients turned out to be not that easy. A lot of Satoshi's original scaling vision relies on the ability of SPV nodes to detect an invalid chain. That's simply not a reality yet and might turn out to be impossible.
Also, Satoshi was fully capable of changing his mind and adjust to new facts. Pointing to things he wrote 6 years ago doesn't really help much if it doesn't adress the actual problem.
All things being equal, we should probably honor "Satoshi's Vision". But all things seldom are.
To me it seems virtually impossible that Satoshi wouldn't support the so called core roadmap if he were still around.

If you move your bitcoin away from that address first, he would only be able to steal the fork coin (bcash, bitcoin gold, etc). But instead of stealing, that service charges a 10% fee and makes more money this way (via happy customers recommending it).
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:06:10


Perhaps I could have made that clearer: I do think most signers had good intentions. But even those who see this as a way to seize control may think that this is actually in everybody's best interest. I think almost all signers have underestimated the implications of a successful SegWit2x hard fork.
I have no qualms with the companies that signed the NYA and either dropped out or will drop out at some point in the coming weeks. But I think the parties that will hang on to it to the bitter end are toxic to bitcoin.
At the end of the day, what I see as bitcoin needs to be able to handle what I see as an attack on it, or the thing I understand as bitcoin will have failed. Maybe SW2X will succeed and bitcoin is not what I hoped it would be, but I see the chance of that happening actually quite low. Once I have a clear understanding of how to do it properly and the opportunity to do so, I will dump all my 2x coins for what I consider bitcoins. Like I did with bcash.
One point I want to reiterate: this is not just about changing a parameter from 4 to 8. This is about the precedent of changing bitcoin in a way that has not been properly argued for. A change that is forced through without any good justification. This is the invasion of politics and backroom deals.

No one is saying "you need a DevKit for Bitcoin" so this entire bullet point is moot.

No one is saying "you need this custom hardware to use the service API".


This does not compare very well to OpenBazaar. Yes it can be replicated. Note that most of the 21 software will be open source as well.


It's convenient for developers who understand what 21 is building and want to participate.


The "bitcoin computer" doesn't aim to replace Trezor, but being dedicated hardware it offers better security than your desktop OS. So among other things, it also offers some of what Trezor does for $99.




"he might as well just buy bitcoins" is completely missing the point of this device.


No, the fact that it's heavily backed by VCs does not necessarily mean that there's something to it. At least not if you think yes/no. But how about the chance that there is something more to it.

Change of sourcecode vs change in policy.
The limit was never intended as an economic limit, but as a spam failsafe. Whenever usage was increasing, the softlimit was increased as well. But now, to continue this policy, we have to change the hardlimit because the softlimit can't be raised any further. And this introduces all kinds of questions which every expert has a slightly different answer to.
But to continue the policy of the past years, we need to again increase the limit. This is the neutral option policy-wise.

I already agreed with you that the technical part is easy. Simply "adding a bitcoin payment option to a website" is peanuts.
This is not what we are talking about here, though. Adding a bitcoin and/or paypal option to a website with an enormous userbase without confusing/deterring them is a little harder. (Increasing the number of payment options often actually decreases sales.) Additionally it increases the overhead in accounting and licensing negotiations.

The core project would need to change the process that determines what gets merged and what doesn't.

You can't mine or securely store bitcoin with only software on your desktop. (Mining for profit is not the goal of this device.)
Yes, you can build your own version of the devkit which would seem to do similar things for less money. And I'm sure people will, especially after 21 open sources much of their software. But the homebrew version would not benefit from first level support and would generally be more hassle to keep up-to-date. It would be google cardboard compared to the oculus rift.
It might be fun for you, but the people who this devkit is targeted at do not have an interest in that. They want the framework/stack that is supported by the leading company in that space. $400 is nothing from their point of view. Their hourly rate is $100. They'll buy a couple and do some R&amp;D.

Yes, it is very useful for developers. It offers a framework for doing IoT stuff with bitcoin.

8GB will be the blocksize **limit** in **20 years**. Now look at bandwidth and storage in 1995 and keep in mind that

b) we can handle blocks far bigger than 1mb today already.
@_date: 2015-09-28 20:22:49


Yup, but still an option if you can trust the source.


Naive approach: take a snapshot, embed it in a block. Have that block confirm a couple thousand times, then forget everything before it.


The post I initially replied to comments on the chart, which looks only at bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:16:01


"It" (being a blocksize increase) already happened: there is quite simply no 1MB chain anymore. The increase was delayed by a few individuals who claimed to have very strong objections to the implementation. Technically and in principle. Then, when a path presented itself that allowed them to get something they want, they completely signed off on the implementation. Every line of SegWit code was suddenly acceptable... "As long as we hard fork, it's OK." -- "Why?" -- "Because." -- "No seriously why?" -- "Doesn't matter, we already agreed to do it."
I ask again: what's with the hard fork obsession? The 1MB blocksize limit is GONE. (And no, I don't believe that's SegWit2x's accomplishment -- at all.)


Then stop splitting the community. It must be 100% clear to you now that dozens of high quality core contributing software developers WILL NOT participate in the btc1 project under any circumstance. Can you get into that for a second and explain why you think that's an acceptable price to pay to get... what... corporate control over bitcoin?
I *really* don't get this. Help.
Core's only fault is having the position that there are unaddressed (and unaddressable) concerns with SW2X and that compromise for the sake of compromise is not a good or realistic outcome with all things bitcoin, especially when it's the middle ground between sense and non-sense. Why would anyone be opposed to that position?! Unless there are more selfish aspects to it with regards to one's own company and its success.

Not actively, coincidentally. Bitcoin just doesn't care about other financial systems. It's design isn't driven by them in the sense that it would react to changes there.
Bitcoin is an idea for a completely different way of doing things. Development follows that idea even if at some point it means that it won't be competitive. Which may very well be true if you compare decentralized bitcoin to a centralized alternative. If you don't care about the ideas and principles behind bitcoin, it might not come out on top.

It's not about mining for profit, but mining to receive small amounts of bitcoin which in turn enable you to use certain features. Think $3 a month in increased electricity cost and the feature being for example an ad-free internet.
You can't ask someone to go through all the steps necessary to acquire and load such small quantities of bitcoin onto their device(s). Think of it like making bitcoin opt-out instead of opt-in.

I think you give the market too much credit.
We generally don't know how many people are informed and how many are not. A lot of people determining the price right now view it as a thing you can trade online and possibly make a lot of money with. They don't know or care about the halving or potentially disruptive capabilities of bitcoin.
If everyone knew what the best informed people in this space knew, the price would be much much higher, IMHO.
I'm very sceptical about claims that everything there is to know about bitcoin is already priced in, as in "completely taken into account".

Again: If you think it's OK that end-users need to buy some bitcoin at coinbase first for this stuff, then we're not on the same page (not even the same book) and it's pointless to argue.


Then you'll have to either load enough bitcoin so you never have to reload, or repeat this process regularly. Having to do it even only once is already a non-starter, though. Because this requires that someone somewhere enters some credit card details, has a credit card to begin with, or a bank account. Provide his name, address and so on. We want to get away from that. The chip is supposed to be just there, draw some power and generate enough bitcoins for microtransactions.
This is all designed so that it just works out-of-the-box. All you need is the hardware, an internet connection and electricity and you're good to go.

You can be sure the chip will be embedded in an internet connected computing device. You can be *pretty* sure this will include smartphones and tablets.

In short: *you* define what you are developing for.

How easy or hard it is to obtain bitcoin yourself depends heavily on where you live. And preloading bitcoin onto the device or giving out gift cards with the purchase may not be an option for other reasons, besides the fact that you want to introduce developers to the idea of mining small amounts on a device and that your whole long term strategy has this at it's very core. Again, this is the turn-key, all-in-one package angle.

Yup, I didn't claim anything else. I wasn't sure he understood what I'm saying in principle (RE: increase in blocksize = further decrease in # nodes), which essentially is that if enough new people come on board, whatever the percentage of people willing to run (new) full nodes may be, it could very well be enough to counter the decline in fullnodes.


Sure. Again, not refuting that (as I explicitly mentioned). But how is this relevant to his claim that an increase in blocksize will further reduce the number of nodes? That's entirely hypothetical and depends on a number of factors, which I tried to point out.
Also, the block size didn't remain the same. Average block size increased, only the hard-limit stayed the same. Softlimits were increased in 09/2013 and 03/2014 from 250kb to 350kb and from 350kb to 750kb respectively. Which actually is to your point that the decline and increase may be correlated, but that's still entirely unproven.

Kind of, or more precisely, understanding that this may actually make sense.


You're not mining dollars or cents. You mine bitcoin. The aim is not to be able to convert it and buy a milkshake eventually. The aim is to mine enough to buy an API call from someone that accepts satoshis as payment for that.

So there's a dev kit selling standard or what are you saying? This is a stupid point along the lines of the "I can tell by the pixels" meme.


In my simple example: The user base is people who want to store a file for a few satoshis per KB, *programmatically*. What platform that program runs on, is completely irrelevant.


First, keep in mind that the embedded chips would be willingly mining at a loss, because it's a form of payment. On a large scale, this would put a huge pressure on miners as we know them and might even make direct for-profit mining obsolete.
Second, difficulty doesn't rise because chips are more efficient, it rises when the hashrate increases. As long as for-profit mining is viable, the one will of course naturally cause the other. But even then, as long as you have a very efficient chip in your device, you can mine enough bitcoin for micro/nanotransactions. The 21 chip is currently very efficient.


Yes. I'm just showing you there's an easy way around your supposed deal-breaking technical problems.


Why should it be? Right now, with the 21 BC chip -- ignoring the $399 initial cost because that's not what end-users will pay -- you can effectively buy small amounts of bitcoin for close to market price. You can do the math yourself because we know that it runs at 50GH/s with 15W of power.
Additionally theres the HUGE cost of having to actually deal with that stuff, manually buy and transfer it to your device. Time is money. Convenience is important. Automation is key. If you don't see it that way, NONE of what 21 is doing will ever make sense to you.

Let's assume we can somehow measure support accurately. If "the majority" adopts new rules, then that's the new bitcoin. Core currently sets the bar at 95% and that's fine. But it's an self-imposed restriction to make the process go through smoothly. Ultimately a simple majority is enough, but the closer we get to the 50% mark, the messier it gets.


No. Within each group there are different levels of conviction. It's true that there are those who would keep the minority chain alive no matter what. I'd wager that their numbers are not large enough to matter in any case where there is a significant majority on the other side (meaning it's probably not that bad).

The mining lottery is so essential to bitcoin and the blockchain that once you remove it and replace it with some sort of permissioned system, you end up with something that is unnecessarily complex and inefficient compared to "JUST" a database.

Can we agree that amongst *new* bitcoins users, a subset will be interested in running a *new* full node?
Do more people stop running a node than the amount of new people willing to operate one come in? Over the last year, yes, obviously. But I'm asking if this will also true if the userbase doubles? triples? ten-folds? And how many node operators actually shut down their nodes because of the blocksize getting bigger? Does doubling the blocksize mean we lose half the fullnodes? If not, how are those things related then? If at all? How many simply shut down because they lost interest, or switched to SPV clients because they really just wanted a wallet.

You are missing the point which is what YOU don't understand. Of course it's technically possible to use your own bitcoin instead of the coins mined by the 21 chip. This is about having an environment that resembles future usage, obtainable as an all-in-one package from amazon. It's like saying we'll never need mining chips in devices, because people can just load their own bitcoin onto their devices just the same.

We're generally talking micro-/nanopayments with the 21 stuff -- currently impossible with bitcoin on-chain, hence the "BitTransfers". A blocksize limit increase, or LN &amp; co may change things in the future.


They stated they want to open that up in the future. We'll see. For now there's no harm in assuming good faith, because it's inconsequential. If they don't follow through, I'll grab a pitchfork myself.


Automation is the key. You do not want user interaction with any of this stuff. That drives a lot of the design here. **This is important to acknowledge**.


Sometimes? It's quite obviously not a consumer product.


Of course that would be far cheaper, but that is completely missing the point and you're failing to see the reason for the existence of this thing. 21 is asking: "In a world where this exact environment is the norm on nearly every device, what would you do with it?"
Most of the criticism around 21 can be categorized as [arguments from incredulity]( More people should apply the [principle of charity]( especially if you take into account who is working on this, who they are partnered with / who they convinced of their ideas and how much money is invested in this. There are no guarantees obviously and yes, there have been many bad investments in the past and yes you can call me naive if that makes you feel better, but try to get the big picture and don't fill the blanks only with assumptions supporting your idea of this being total nonsense.
The last part is exactly what other people do when criticizing bitcoin (it'll never take off, it can be hacked cuz it's computer stuff, governments will ban it, ...). That's what I meant.
Ask yourself what would need to happen / what would need to be true to make all this apparent crazyness work. Then ask if it's possible.

Once SegWit is done, we can get another 30%+ from Schnorr.
Once *that* is done, I believe we'll see work being done towards a hard fork that is actually worthwile. Flexcap limit, various fixes and improvements / elimination of technical debt.

The "Bitcoin computer" is a dev-kit. It's *everything* you need [to start developing on 21 Inc's platform]( Hardware -&gt; OS -&gt; CLI -&gt; Cloud integrated into one product. It's supported by 21.
You can't build "the same thing with a Raspberry Pi and a USB miner". That's like comparing the oculus rift to a google cardboard. Any homebrew version of this would be similar, but far from beeing the same thing. And it would be your own little solution compared to the industry standard that may arise from 21 Inc's efforts.

But he didn't start with the needs of a paying customer with a for-profit business in mind. He started with the need of humanity as a whole for a system like this. He did something very very different from what Jobs would have done: he made it open, permissionless and free for anyone.


Because it was (and still is) mainly about the technology and not so much about individual users at this point. Bitcoin is not yet mainstream. I think there's a good argument to be made that we shouldn't want it to be at this point. Of course this doesn't go down well with people wanting to get rich quick.
All current users are early adopters and as an early adopter you accept that things are a bit rough around the edges.


All in due time. Right now it should satisfy the basic need of developers, technical people, enthusiasts / early adopters. You currently can not build a GUI for bitcoin that would satisfy the needs of average joe.

[What is this then](


It's a simple ad-hoc example (= not meant to be a fully fledged business plan). But even with this in mind, it's not nonsensical. [Here]( are a few other examples (fully in the realm of proof of concept / toying around, though. But that's the stage we're at.)


No, that's not what I'm saying. Read the last two sentences you quoted.


In that case, from your charger at home, yes.


Again: That's a manual, time consuming process: You need to get your credit card, register somewhere, enter your details, buy bitcoin, transfer those to your device, possibly handle bitcoin addresses, etc. Too much hassle for the $3 worth of bitcoin. And impossible for a machine to do.


Remind me why that matters? Running a 50GH/s miner virtually guarantees you some amount of bitcoin, depending on the difficulty. The rest is variance. And variance is exactly what buffered mining takes care of.


No. *You* don't need to do anything. That's the whole point. It's automated.
@_date: 2015-11-17 21:28:58


Just saying it's weird if you preload those machines with a fixed amount of bitcoin and depending on when you buy the device you get more or less out of it depending on the bitcoin price. Or the price of the device changes accordingly. It's confusing, distracting.


Not if they can't get bitcoin easily.
Look, the main benefit to this thing is that it's a platform that people base their work on. It's a standard being born. Interoperability. Compatibility. A marketplace where you can publish your own and consume other services.
Just watch this unfold. They know what they're are doing. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:56:14
Couple of years back I thought that people just can't wrap their heads around the pace of technological progress. After all, [this]( was a 5MB hard disk 60 years ago. Today I have &gt;13,000 times the capacity on an sd card the size of a thumbnail. No idea what that IBM beast did cost back then, but the sd card costs what... $10-$20?
So the argument that big blocks won't be that bad was and still is very appealing on the surface.
But of course, the devil is in the details. It's not just about storage space and cost isn't just measured in dollars. Sure 2MB is OK today, 4MB probably too without serious drawbacks. In any case: it doesn't matter. Turns out I couldn't wrap my head around the stuff they were already building on top of bitcoin, mainly the lightning network. Whatever you think you can gain in terms of scale by increasing the blocksize is completely dwarfed by the scalability LN provides.
In light of those developments, it's beyond stupid to cling to the blocksize as means of increasing scale. We will need to go there at some point as LN needs bigger blocks eventually. But it's the absolute last place you wanna go to scale up the system. We should adjust the blocksize as a way to scale only when all other options are exhausted. SegWit is an edge case because its blocksize increase is opt-in as it doesn't require a hard fork.
*Anyone* who looks at this topic objectively will come to the same conclusion: SegWit is the only sane way forward at this point. If you're against it, you either don't understand it very well or have ulterior motives. It's as simple as that.

I don't think that is necessarily true, or that it would change much. Nor do I think that this is about on-chain transactions at this point.

Old clients see a 1MB block and don't care about anything else. New clients see an up to 4MB block and do care about the extra ~3MB.
We can also call it a package instead of a block if you like, but that 4MB package needs to be transmitted over the wire in it's entirety for upgraded bitcoin clients to accept it.
It's essentially an up to 4MB block, or in practical terms a ~75% effective blocksize increase (within an upgraded network).
@_date: 2016-10-14 05:42:52
I don't know if that holds true if you're doing something completely revolutionary and new. Bitcoin right now is basically just computer science. It's research and development. Once we know what exactly we can do with it and on what scale, we can start to really care about the UX.
Even though bitcoin inadvertently has a lot of shareholders, we shouldn't look at it like a profit-oriented business like Apple looks at product development. This is an open source technology/science project.

For-profit mining does and is. The chip is there to give you a way to turn a little electricity into (very) small amounts of bitcoin so the device is able to do transactions on the blockchain -- for whatever purpose.
The alternative would be to buy some bitcoin yourself (and encounter KYC/AML and other hurdles), or preload the device which would make it more expensive initially and may introduce legal / regulatory issues.
Preloading a fixed amount of BTC is also awkward with bitcoin's volatility.
Being able to get an all-in-one package through amazon makes it easier to on-board developers.

A requirement for getting a large user base is actually having something that can be used. This is what 21 is doing: building a platform, so developers can actually build, use and discover these kinds of apps and let them talk to each other. Get everybody on the same page. Have something that people can flock to.
And the 21BC is all you need to participate. In return you get a preconfigured (OS, software, blockchain) RaspberryPi with regular updates and a way to generate coins similar to how you would do it later if all this comes to fruition and these kinds of chips are embedded in computing devices. A way to buy very small amounts of bitcoin for close to market price, payable via your electricity bill. Without registration, validation, a bank account etc.
Now imagine a future 21BC being distributed in a OLPC kind of way and all that "you can simply buy bitcoin yourself" rhetoric immediately goes out the window.

I'm assuming that it's not really about the blocksize. If it were, we would already have bigger blocks via SegWit. I don't buy for a second that this whole drama only exists because Jihan &amp; co want 4MB instead of 2.
The two options are:
* 4MB within a couple months in a rushed and irresponsible hard fork, a compromise for the sake of compromise.
* 2MB in a couple of weeks (well 5-6 months ago, really). In a way that's as safe as it gets and will make future hard forks to further increase blocksize actually *easier*.

I don't think its targeting existing Bitcoin developers at all. I think it's a way of on-boarding developers in general.


Probably not the reason for the price tag and definitely not the reason to produce the chip in the first place. 21 is a big game hunter, they're in for the long haul and that includes mining chips in devices. This is a way of introducing this to the world.


AFAIK the chip itself is very efficient. As long as you're only interested in (very) small amounts, the 21BC allows you to buy bitcoin with electricity for close to market price (without the KYC/AML stuff). This completely ignores the initial investment of $400 though ;) But keep in mind end users won't have to buy a $400 machine when all of this comes to fruition.

Unless you want to hold on to the idea that they might be lying, the mining pool centralization argument is moot.
The incentives argument may hold some water, but since all that mining may become a byproduct on a massive number of devices and required for certain functions you really don't need monetary incentives at all anymore.

So as I understood it, the question was if we could split up a bitcoin in smaller units than a satoshi. This is technically possible and doing so doesn't change the value of the bitcoins I have. It merely expresses that the value I hold is already so high, that we need to split it in smaller units so I can buy small stuff. Before the change I'd have 1 Bitcoin or 100,000,000 Satoshis, after the change I'd still have 1 Bitcoin but call it now e.g. 100,000,000,000 Millisatoshis. Using new units makes it easy to understand that the value of the bitcoin I have does not change, only the denomination. It wouldn't be clever to redefine what one BTC is, but you could do it and it still wouldn't change my purchasing power. It's just different numbers and/or unitnames to describe the exact same amount of wealth I have.


Yes, but I would only have 0.1 BTC to spend on eggs (since we redefined what a BTC is).

I don't find that case very convincing. Miners don't have a magical way of knowing what the "*real* economic majority" wants. And whenever you ask key players in the space, they're wildly in favor of SW. That twitter poll is just another indicator pointing in the very same direction.
There's also a gray area of "can I get away with it?" where miners might act against the users best interest as long as they can if it benefits them. E.g. why mine empty blocks when there is a backlog? Or maybe covert ASICBOOST really is a thing for bitmain.
Another thing might be that they *think* they act in the users best interest by taking a misguided stand against "borgstream core".

Now it's slowly [happening]( thanks to Roger's &amp; Jihan's little campaign.
I have more than four times the number of litecoins than I have bitcoins, so if it ever gets to the point that silver replaces gold, I can live with that. OTOH a switch like that would establish that cryptocurrencies are not and will never be a good store of value.

Huh? This was my first reply in this thread.
AFAIK using a colored coins scheme you can track &gt;18k of tokens with only one bitcoin. So while there is demand for bitcoin to register assets in the blockchain, the fees to transact those tokens have a far greater impact.
Generally: the more uses bitcoin has, the more value it has. Higher value, higher price. (Eventually.)

There is: If you don't want SegWit because it hurts your profitability, you can hide behind a smoke screen of "technical debt!", "too complex!", "forced upon users!", etc.
A patch that only kills *covert* ASICBOOST and does nothing else is far more difficult to oppose, especially since BITMAIN should be all for it if they're really not using it covertly as they claim.
If you oppose such a change, it's akin to admitting using ASICBOOST covertly and lying about it.
Once the fix is deployed, we know that any remaining opposition to SegWit has nothing to do with hidden costs like that.

Note that I distinguised between "simple" (e.g. everything not consensus related) and "more elaborate". You skipped over the latter.


You don't. With service providers, you simply talk to them / wait for their statements. Miners can signal. End users are more difficult to gauge. That's why people consider hard forks dangerous.


The ruleset that the majority uses and calls bitcoin defines what "bitcoin" is. If you prefer a different, incompatible set of rules, you have e.g. "Bitcoin Unlimited" ... or XT, or Classic. Or Litecoin.


This is simply not true. E.g. if a bitcoin exchange doesn't follow a new set of rules proposed by miners (one that might keep the current block reward indefinitely), miners won't be able to exchange their coins for fiat in order to pay for electricity. They depend on what exchanges view as valid bitcoins.


Sorry, but you're wrong. And you should be happy that you are.


This is exactly the reason why they effectively can't change the ruleset. Which is my entire point. If you want to make the case that they can in fact login to github, click fork and start editing the rules, then yes, ofc "miners can change the rules", everybody can. But that's pointless when no one else plays along.

The post is very weird. But since he technically never claimed that he is about to proof his identity in that post I'll treat it as exactly that: a very weird post that awaits explanation.
I mean, why go through the trouble of constructing (successfully) some sort of magic trick to convince Andresen and Matonis of his identity just to destroy all that with a half-hearted deception like that (if it is meant to be proof of him being SN). He must have known that this would be debunked in no time, if that's what he was trying to do.
But it's true that I can't think of any good reason -- other than it being a scam in some way or the other -- not to simply release cryptographic proof. But I still remain open to the possibility that I just can't think of it and there is an explanation. He justifies his decision with being a little difficult. Yeah, no... not good enough. The point Vitalik made is simply a good one.
Then again, maybe he simply made a copy/paste error, however unlikely that seems (yeah, I know). Maybe Satoshi Nakamoto has mental issues. Maybe Kleiman was Satoshi, CW has the keys and the proof shown to Gavin was sound, but he can't really pull off the SN act alone.
Anyways. Why the rush? Why not lay back and let it all sort itself out. He either presents solid proof and an explanation of his behaviour or he doesn't. I'm not risking any bitcoins by not immediately making fun of the guy.

Like email "just replaced" existing fax technology... Bitcoin is in fact something completely new: decentralized consensus.


There's no way to guarantee it, correct. But it's more than likely that it will. Look at the number of software projects involving bitcoin... look at the investor money coming in... the startups... the papers being written... the studies being made... the progress that has been made in the last couple of years... wake up, this thing is happening. Maybe it ultimately won't be the day-to-day currency we dream it up to be right now, but it will at the very least be the foundation of a ton of innovation in the financial sector and beyond.


You are missing the point of bitcoin: decentralization. Banks cannot conceive a direct competitor to bitcoin. Their propositions would always be centralized. The average person may not care about decentralization (or think they don't), but that doesn't really matter. It only affects the timescale.

@_date: 2015-11-30 07:01:05
First, you ignored the rest of my post. It heavily depends in what kind of position you are, e.g. you work at a company that might just buy the chips in bulk and embed them in their products if their R&amp;D dep builds something interesting with this. Also, if you define and build your service, e.g. "store a file here for X satoshis per KB", then you DONT CARE who or what uses your service. You don't have to.
Second, *if* this whole thing is successful which is *certainly a possibility*, then those chips will most definitely be embedded into mobiles and tablets eventually. Right now? Probably not possible due to power requirements and heat dissipation issues. It's reasonable to assume that technological advancements will solve this in the future. Until then: Embed the mining chip in the charger, not the smartphone. Let it work 24/7 at home and **automatically** transfer the satoshis over when you recharge your phone.
Third, I really don't know why people won't understand their simple core proposition:
**Do micro/nano transactions on the internet and pay with your electricity bill.**
Microtransactions are currently impossible on-chain, thus the 21 micropayment server. With mining you as a developer today and eventually the end-users do not have to acquire bitcoin manually to make those microtransactions. This is an important factor that drives the design of the software. No need for KYC/AML, Credit Cards, Bank Accounts, etc. Most users probably won't ever know that this works on bitcoin. Buffered mining ensures that people can immediately start and do not have to wait until 21 finds a block, but this requires the (as DRM misrepresented) hardware lock. All this will also ensure the safety of the bitcoin network as soon as they open it up to allow more than one pool, which they stated is what they're going to do in the future.
Draw a little more power at home, secure the network, get e.g. ad-free internet.

Because the possibility (however likely or unlikely) of CW being SN is very hard to swallow, apparently.
It's quite telling that everything that fits the narrative of CW just being a scam artist is easily accepted as truth without doing much research, while anything hinting that there's something to his claim is quickly disregarded, sometimes with crazy theories of a grandmaster scam artist at work (and sometimes hes just a complete idiot again, see the blog post "debunking").
I think the things CW stands to gain from this are in no way justifying the efforts to pull off something like that.
It just doesn't add up, either way. So I guess we'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2016-05-05 05:45:02
You say signing a message with one of the keys associated with SN would be, for all practical purposes, irrefutable proof that he owns said keys. I think Gavin was shown exactly that in his private session with him. So this is irrefutable proof *for Gavin*. We on the other side have only Gavin's testimony on the matter, which is of course *not* irrefutable proof to us.
I think you're interpreting Gavin's statements wrong when you claim that he wasn't presented above proof, based on what you quoted. Gavin just explained that this is what he expected to happen *publicly* as well, not the weird blog post CW did.
At least that's my take away from a lot of different quotes on the matter.

There's some other explanation. Generall weirdness of CW, or a copy/paste error... I don't know. It just doesn't add up, both ways.
If it was really meant as proof, then I think the most likely explanation is that this is a (quite successful) attempt at discrediting / ridiculing Andresen and Matonis (and a failed attempt at Antonopolous).

If X is a simple, backward compatible change you just start using it. If it's backward compatible, but a little more elaborate (like SegWit) and you want to make absolutely sure everything will go smoothly, you wait for miners to get ready first.
If it's a backward incompatible change, you need support from virtually everyone: Service providers (merchants, exchanges, web wallets, ...), miners and end-users. If anyone of those groups harbors significant opposition to your change, you're going to have a hard time getting it through. This is a feature, not a bug™.


Sorry, no. This is a misunderstanding. Miners work within an established set of rules. There they select and order transactions, make sure the rules are followed (which every fullnode does), put valid transactions into a block and broadcast it.
Miners do not establish the rules, otherwise they'd have the power to do literally anything to bitcoin. This is often countered with "well they wouldn't do anything that hurts the value of bitcoin" which is a very naive view. This would open bitcoin up to several attack vectors.
Thankfully, all they can really do is censor transactions of others and doublespend their own.
If you disagree, consider this: You are a merchant and accept bitcoin directly. In the latest block there's a transaction for a payment of 10 BTC to you that has a signature that seems to be invalid. For some reason that block is not orphaned but gets built upon and the transactions now has 6 confirmations. Your wallet doesn't show the 10 BTC (because your node couldn't verify the signature and therefore didn't accept any of the recent blocks). You make sure you have the correct software running and you do. Do you ship the product to the buyer?

You can claim that this principle only applies to the legal system, but that doesn't make it so. You're essentially saying "that doesn't count" because you can't argue against it.


Yes, you did, by not accepting his statement as truth and asking for proof. Of course it's *possible* he's lying but that doesn't matter, because until you can show that he actually is lying, we are bound by common sense to assume that he is not, at least if we want to be objective.


He doesn't, he simply quotes him on the topic. See above.


All true. It's not proof, but it doesn't have to be. We need to accept Szabos statement on the matter as truth (as did), until someone can show that he is lying. It's simple as that. You can choose not to believe him, but that does in no way put any burden of proof on Szabo or &gt; It's humorous to see the lengths you'll go to try and make an insignificant point.
Insignificant, but correct. It also takes two to tango.

The point is, you as the merchant would not blindly accept a confirmed transaction, because you yourself are explicitly validating it (or BitPay etc. on your behalf) according to the rules encoded in your fullnode implementation.

A few additional thoughts:
Currently, each day 3600 BTC are mined. At the current price that's $1.2 million per day. Mining costs should be slightly below that. Let's assume electricity costs of mining add up to $1 million in total, per day.
If we assume that these 21 mining chips are eventually embedded in nearly all devices, electricity costs of those chips should be small enough so that the users barely notice and simply don't care. Let's say running the chip costs around $0.10 per day and yields $0.09 per day in bitcoin.
This would mean that if we have 10 million devices running those chips, we'd have the same hashrate as today and it would cost every user additional $3 per month. In return he gets whatever crazy stuff is now possible with the internet of things, micro/nano payments, machine-to-machine payments. Maybe this even completely kills the advertising model for financing stuff on the internet.
That's certainly not a rip-off.
edit: to put those 10 million devices in perspective: in 2014 over **1.2 billion** smartphones alone have been sold worldwide to end users.
Imagine over the course of the next couple of years we get to a point where one in 10 smartphones has version 2 or 3 of the 21 chip embedded and is mining 24/7.

Why? Gold is used as a store of value and has also no fundamental demand as a currency today. But there was a lot of that in the past and that's really what backs gold: history. The belief that, because it was valued so high for so many centuries, it will be valued high in the future.
[Industrial demand is pretty low with ~10% of the gold supply.]( And the demand for gold jewelry is based on the belief that it's valuable.
Bitcoin can take on the store-of-value role far better as gold. It just lacks the history of gold and most people don't trust it yet. Probably for the better at this point in time. It needs to mature, but the fundamentals are there.

Bitcoin's main goal is not and never was to provide free transactions.
The evil we intent to avoid is a centralized, controllable, censorable monetary system.
You know what's neat? With the Lightning Network we also get virtually free transactions on top of that. Occasionally you'll have to pay a standard bitcoin transaction fee to connect to or disconnect from the Lightning Network. In between, you can do almost any number of transactions. Instantly, for negligible fees (if any at all).

If miners are attacking, they can recoup some of those fees by sometimes mining a block with their own transactions.
But other's may also be simply willing to spend serious money in order to make bitcoin unappealing. Just because there's a cost doesn't mean it unsustainable -- at least for quite a while if fees are near-zero.
Thinking about it... as long as blocks are not full you can spam zero fee transactions. Once they are full, people have to pay fees to get included. Whenever there are enough legit transactions waiting to get included, you can spam transactions with a slightly less fee so they're unlikely to cost you anything. This will slowly drive fees up for everybody without costing you all that much.

Good, but pointless in this case. By the time you would really need to trust them, they should have already shown why you don't. If not, then they are not to be trusted of course.
I'm willing to assume good faith, as long as nothing really depends on it.


I don't think you understood my point. I suspect mining will just be a natural part of nearly all computing devices and while an individual user of e.g. a smartphone may have no direct monetary or ideological incentive to mine, it doesn't matter because it's just woven into the system and is required to participate in a number of things. Overcoming that mining power to do censorship etc is still disincentivized by the huge cost of it.

This is not eventual consistency. This is inconsistency. :)
Usually you have one or more read-side databases. These are flat, highly reduntant and very fast datastores. Need more performance? Add another machine and hook it up.
Additionally you have a write-side database which only purpose is to keep a consistent state of your application. It's a terrible data source to query against, but that's OK, because that's what the (eventually consistent) read-side is for. When you want to do a transaction, you restore the correct balance from the trustworthy datastore, not the eventual consistent one.
The core idea is that high query performance and consistent data are mutually exclusive, so you separate read and write concerns. RDBMS don't scale that well, because they have to keep everything consistent at all times.
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:51:50
Usually when talking about eventual consistency you're talking about the read-side which may show stale data temporarily. When writing into the data store you do NOT rely on the read-side for your business logic / computations. If you do, you don't have eventual consistency, you have permanent inconsistency.

Still ~4 months to go until the next SegWit cycle begins. Developers are almost unanimously for it. Businesses prefer it over the status quo. Now half of the hashpower signals for it. Another third of hashpower is OK with it, but they want to use it as a bargaining tool to get their pound of flesh.
Opposition is weak. Watch it go to 95%. If not until november, then next year.
If Roger Ver wants to dump another couple of million into his anti segwit campaign, so be it. Once that well is dry, we can move on. Heck, I'm willing to wait a litte longer on SegWit if that means that we can relieve Ver of some of his bitcoins.

"Core" is just a loosely coupled group of developers working on the same repository. "Consensus by bitcoin core" means "consensus by a diverse group of bitcoin developers that hold themselves to a very high standard". Core has no political interests. No profit motive. Blockstream isn't controlling core, etc.
Most people agree on SegWit: they want it, ASAP. 
SegWit2x is a sad attempt at tacking a hard fork onto SegWit. No real justification... "just because".
SegWit itself already *doubles* the current blocksize on average, with up to 4MB blocks. SegWit2x would allow up to 8MB blocks. Research suggests that anything above 4MB would significantly reduce the number of fullnodes.
[This]( chart sure makes it look like the recent capacity issues were artificial. Roger Ver has admitted to Charlie Shrem that he is trying to push bitcoin core developers out by any means necessary and is spending as much as $500k per month on that.
In any case, with SegWit alone we'll have twice the capacity, without the need to go down the hard fork route. After that, we'll get 30% more out of it via Schnorr signature aggregation. Then the Lightning Network will take many transactions out of the blocks and manage them behind much fewer on chain channel funding transactions. LN will provide instant and cheap transactions for small and medium amounts, much much safer than zero conf ever could. If you monitor the chain once in a while, it's as safe as on chain transactions.
At some point, we'll replace the hard coded limit with a flexible blocksize cap. Maxwell already said as much in his proposed roadmap, which many core developers agreed with.

You all act like you exposed his clever ruse. There is no deception here: it's plainly obvious not "the proof" and therefor doesn't make any sense if you view it as an attempt at tricking everybody into thinking he is SN. Why go through the trouble and fly in Andresen and Matonis just to fuck it all up with a halfhearted attempt like that a few days later?
He will provide the actual proof if he is SN. If he doesn't do that, then we can go back to ignoring him. And scold Gavin for his fuck up.

In that case, you either stay out completely or settle for an IOU (bundled with bitcoin maximalists scolding you for *not really using bitcoin!!*).
It's important that the base layer retains its censorship resistant, permissionless properties. If you have problem with anything specific build on top of it, then don't use that product or service.

Probably very true, but also off topic :P


My guess is that you envision some crazy implementation that would indeed be insane. But the concept (e.g. CQRS) is sound and in use by almost any very high traffic site in one form or another. RDBMSs do not scale well horizontally. If you buy a second server und put a loadbalancer in front of those two you do not get twice the performance. It's much less efficient than scaling flat, redundant, eventual consistent NoSQL backends.

@_date: 2017-07-09 21:55:16


Agreed. And the economic majority chooses bitcoin core.


Note that this is not yet the signalling that is needed to activate it. They're signalling that they're going to signal SegWit2x.
Here's what's going to happen: Most people will continue to run bitcoin core and they won't merge SegWit2x. Meanwhile SegWit2x run by miners will activate the original SegWit (BIP141) via BIP91. All core nodes are happy and start using SegWit. As core nodes don't agree with the hard fork 3 months later, miners will have to decide if they want to go through with it or not. If they do and the economic majority doesn't follow, they will be mining an altcoin. Risk of a split will be seen as far too high for little to no reward as SegWit's 2MB will be more than enough at the time.
At that point, everybody will be looking towards LN anyway.

I don't think there is a realistic scenario in which fees could ever get anywhere near that high. But if for some reason banks and/or governments are using a public blockchain that Joe Schmoe can't afford to use but easily audit, then that's still worth quite a lot, IMHO.
More realistically, improvements in hard- and software will keep on chain transactions affordable for most of the world. Especially if you only need to do them once in a while to open or close a channel.
And as long as the network remains sufficiently decentralized, we can also up the requirements for running a full node. But as long as there are other and far more effcient approaches to increasing scale/scalability, it simply doesn't make sense to go there.
But if in the end high fees are inevitable, we still shouldn't sacrifice bitcoin's censorship resistance in order to make it support use cases that perhaps don't even need it. People in Venezuela are probably willing to pay fees that would make Roger's head spin.

Most of the target audience simply doesn't care if it's free or $400.
There's value in having an all-in-one solution. Ready almost immediately after you plug it in. With the chip itself you essentially buy bitcoin at market price and pay via electricity, circumventing exchanges and KYC etc. Yes, if you factor in the $400 investment, it's far more expensive, but remember that this chip will just be in an end-users device, without them possibly knowing about it, if all goes according to 21's plan. This kit aims to be an development environment simulating that reality.

IIRC it makes a difference if you preload a device with bitcoins and sell it, or if the device generates bitcoins itself. Can't remember if it had to do with being classified as a money transmitter or something else. Can't find the post I'm remembering vaguely.

SegWit2x won't go through, as it isn't a worthwhile solution to anything. It's utterly reckless, even more so than BIP148. The only reason we have the SegWit2x proposal is an attempt to compromise with obstructionist miners (assuming good faith). It's the middle ground between sense and nonsense.

I don't get why the hard fork aspect is such a huge requirement for them. Chances are they're not telling us something.

@_date: 2017-07-09 14:49:16


That's very different from assuming they're against increasing the blocksize in general. Their position is and always has been that a hard forking change should only be done if necessary. To date, a hard forked blocksize increase is not necessary. And there was never an objectively good enough / widely accepted proposal in the first place.


That's precisely *because* segwit has been delayed for no good reason. Time spent on building additional stuff on top of SegWit is possibly wasted if it never activates. There are plenty of other important things to do, so they're focussed on those right now.

Your attack doesn't work. Miners are not the only ones validating. Fullnodes choose the longest/most worked on chain among all valid chains. Simply being the longest chain doesn't make it valid. A fork with invalid blocks will be reorged out of existence eventually, costing non-validating miners a shit ton of money. As you probably know, this has happened before: 
It's only really more profitable to skip validation if you can be sure that there will never be any invalid blocks. Or attackers attempting to steal anyone can spend outputs (which isn't even possible in the way you describe in the first place).

Since we are talking micro- or even nanotransactions and about the amounts required to do those, asking the users to invest a good amount of time and go to an exchange to buy some bitcoin and send it to the device may be way more expensive than embedding a $5 chip or whatever into the device.

Economics is a pseudo-science^1 so it's hard to argue on the same level that mathematics does.
Core contributions, especially those that touch the consensus layer, require something that you cannot give if you're just armed with economics: a precise, technical specification, a detailed justification that doesn't rely on personal opinion or an unproven/unprovable model, and an implementation. It requires to discuss the effects, potential attack vectors and a clear rationale for why one way of doing something was chosen over another.
To me it looks like that Roger has the feeling that he *knows* what's best. He thinks he's the one that *really* gets it. He doesn't want to deal with all that. He's an ideas man. He wants to set the direction and let the codemonkeys deal with the details. "I'll tell you what to do and you just code it, bro. What's the problem? Are you not a coder?" [This]( comes to mind.


You're opposed to it to a degree the second you want to reduce it without providing a clear, fact based justification. "But then we'd have more capacity! Wouldn't that be cool?" is simply not good enough. More capacity, like everything, has a cost. As long as people don't want to acknowledge that this cost exists or are in severe disagreement about how high it is we should tread carefully.

In principal maybe, but surely not in practical terms especially regarding security. And Network effects will always quickly pick a clear winner among those who compete to be *the* digital value token. As for future alt coins: no coin that discards the bitcoin blockchain and introduces a new genesis block will gain any traction as a digital value token (it would proof its own irrelevancy by succeeding). And in honoring the blockchain, that altcoin is effectively an evolution of bitcoin (if successful).


I'm not very familiar with Liberty Reserve, but wikipedia describes it as "a Costa Rica-based centralized digital currency service". So no, not comparable.

There are a lot misunderstandings around what bitcoin is and isn't and what it can and can't be.
Bitcoin is **extremely** inefficient compared to stuff like VISA, MasterCard or Paypal. But there's a reason for that, which is decentralization or censorship resistance.
There is no controlling company behind it and it's currently virtually impossible for governments to completely shut it down or regulate it.
This is what sets it apart from any other payment network / monetary system. This is what makes bitcoin unique. This is what must be preserved at all cost.
As long as that goal is met, we want to onbard as many people as possible. But if at any point we have to decide between allowing more users / cheaper transactions and censorship resistance, the latter will always win.
It is true that Satoshi had no issues with full nodes requiring datacenters. But only with a very important prerequisite: the ability to detect fraud with a SPV client. This prerequisite has not yet been met and it looks like it's a hard problem.
People like Roger do not simply want bitcoin to be successful and change the world, which I believe it will, they want to decide the way it's going to do it on a technical level. But they're unqualified to make those decisions and incapable of admitting that and delegating the decisions to those who are. They want it so bad that they're willing to risk destroying it in the process. Thankfully, that's not so easy. But Roger and Jihan have set bitcoin's development back at least a year or two.
Thanks to the hard work of several top notch developers, bitcoin will perhaps indeed never hit a scale ceiling. But this involves another idea of Satoshi: payment channels. The basis for the Lightning Network. In this scenario, bitcoin's on chain transactions can be viewed more as a way to settle.

People often fear what they don't understand.
The only concrete example of such a position I can think of is Luke Jr opinion that the blocksize limit should even be decreased for now.
But a) that opinion is not shared by many core developers, b) he's not saying that the limit should *never* be increased and c) the justification was that it's mostly spam anyway, which now more and more looks like a [fact](
Do you have any other concrete examples of core developer behavior that scares you? 
@_date: 2016-07-08 05:26:40
It opens bitcoin up to [LZMA exploits]( and offers very little benefits for that. The network traffic saved wouldn't have much effect on block propagation. It would be most noticable during initial block download, but there are better ways to improve on that. Disk space is cheap and again, there are better ways to shrink the size of the blockchain.
If you really want to compress blocks, you're better off writing a bitcoin specific algorithm instead of using a general purpose one.

Regarding transaction selection, the BTC/USD exchange rate is irrelevant. Thus any argument on wether or not the current limit increases confirmation times should ignore USD denominated fees, correct?
"Smart pricing" is done solely within bitcoin, without looking at any exchange rates, correct? If that's not true, please name an example implementation.
What we're seeing are BTC denominated fees staying around the suggested / default fee. USD denominated fees are subject to the exchange rate and have risen accordingly.
Coming back to your original post: If you're adjusting for a) price increase and b) transaction volume increase how are transaction fees rising "faster than any other metric"?

Not all off-chain transactions are created equal. LN transactions do not carry any counterparty risk, like most other off chain solutions do.

It comes down to the question if consumers follow businesses in this case or vice versa.
E.g. I need bitcoin to buy this thing there -vs- I need a merchant accepting this specific flavour of bitcoin to do business with.
I think the former is much more realistic while the latter is idealistic.
I mean, if there are two otherwise identical merchants, one for each fork, then it's completely up to the users. But most of the time that's simply not the case and other factors come into play.

There is very little reason to believe that. If you can make the case that it will.... well, then make it and we can talk about it.


This OTOH is just a logical consequence. Even Satoshi said that at some point full nodes would be hosted in data centers. He was okay with that because he assumed non-datacenter nodes would still be able to detect fraud. Turns out that's a yet to be solved problem and until that's solved (if that's even possible), data center level nodes are a no go. Centralizing bitcoin that much would give governments a very real opportunity to shut it down.
In this context, increasing the blocksize is not a long term scaling mechanism.

Which is missing the essence of his question: Bitcoins are awarded only for verifying transactions, but you need bitcoins to create those transactions in the first place. What gives?
The answer is of course that miners don't get bitcoins for verifying, they get bitcoins for merely being selected for the job. They don't actually need to do it. However if they do, they additionally get the transaction fees in those transactions.

Shipping a device that contains bitcoin is not the goal.
The goal is shipping a device that can automatically send and receive (micro)payments and is funded by electricity. Essentially you pay a small premium via power bill for the convenience of not having to deal with any of the details at all. (Or for the ability to participate in the first place.)
Anyone now itching to say "but it's so easy, just sign up at coinbase and transfer bitcoins to your wallet" is *completely* missing the point. It's OK, just ignore this stuff then.
A nice side effect though is that, if successful, it will completely decentralize mining and render even large hydroelectic mining operations in china unprofitable.

At least you're admitting that BU would let miners control the blocksize. Some people had the illusion that the whole network would decide what's best. Why would you want to give the most centralized part of bitcoin *more* control? Whats to stop him from increasing the blocksize to a point where some miners can't keep up, increasing his share even more?
In any case, it's also possible that he doesn't really want to replace the core team with the subpar BU team, but instead uses BU to stall any progress towards bigger blocks whatsoever. Because those 1MB blocks are earning him big, big money.
Would you believe anything Jihan says? Just because he said it? Why do you give him so much credit?

From my point of view we have a serious issue even with the possibility of ASICBOOST. And because you can't argue anything here that firts your narrative, you just try to ridicule the issue. It painfully obvious.


I don't get what you're trying to say with this? What's the answer you're fishing for here?


What do you think of exactly when you say 'they' or 'Core'? Do you understand that core is just a github repo where a bunch of people contribute? It's not an organization. It's just a lot of developers with differing opinions on all sorts of things who implement the stuff they happen to agree on.

What he coded up was a hard fork. It was exactly what miners asked for, but it definitely wasn't what they wanted.
Think about it this way: It wasn't supposed to be the solution, it was a fallback, as uncontroversial as possible, in case no better solution emerges. With his hard fork, block size would have exceeded 1MB in 2024 IIRC. (We agree that this is way too far out, but again, this was meant as a fallback.)
It also offered a way to *optionally* reduce the blocksize if for some reason we realize that we need to do that (such a scenario is not unthinkable). In order to avoid reducing the blocksize, we would simply have to refrain from activating it before said date.
And regarding the 2024 date, Luke said he had no issues with modifying the schedule. But that didn't get much attention as everybody was focussed on and misunderstanding the 300kb thing.

Sure, I understand that.
But while increasing the blocksize will put a downward pressure on fees, once those fees cross a threshold, certain use cases will become viable again.

@_date: 2017-06-11 22:24:15


I sincerely don't. At least not while assuming good faith.


I do understand that segwit2x is two times the capacity over segwit. But I also understand that this comes at a cost. The cost being the otherwise pointless hard fork. A premature hard fork while research for making them as safe as possible is still [ongoing](


Yes, because they didn't seem to want it for the past 6+ months. Also, the sky is not falling. Yes, even with $5 transactions.


Not if you look at the whole picture, I'm sorry.


Talking solely about compromise is completely sidestepping the necessary justification and rationale for the 2MB hard fork. We can move forward with a *doubling* of capacity right now. Everything for that is already in place. This doubling is the first change of it's kind. The biggest jump if you include the soft limit increases. Why do we need to immediately go 4x? Especially with further increases on the horizon: a pretty safe ~30% with Schnorr and a more meaningful hard fork later on. Lightning will also increase available blockspace by moving a ton of smaller transactions off chain in a safe way.


Oh I understand why it gained wide support so quickly: people are biased towards superficial, easy to grasp arguments. That doesn't mean it's the right way forward for bitcoin.
"Look at this big ass HDD from 20 years ago. Now that much more capacity is this much smaller. Seeeeeee?"


SW alone will do as much. Maybe just for two years, but it's also not a fucking hard fork.
Here's the real problem: People have it in their heads that evil AXA blockstream core is on a mission to actually reduce the blocksize in order to make that sweet lightning hub money... or something like that. Less sarcastically: the notion that core does not want to increase the blocksize by a single byte is out there and pervasive within certain groups.
Those people assume bad faith and want a contract that guarantees a blocksize increase if they stop their blockade. They're holding the network hostage. It's especially stupid if you consider that even when segwit2x seemingly activates, there's nothing stopping people from not following through with it in 6 months. Nothing.
A 1MB -&gt; 2MB hard fork is dumb. It has a very bad risk/reward, especially on the proposed schedule. It's as reckless as BIP148, but many more stoopid. Because the rationale is missing. Yeah sure, we all want orders of magnitude more transactions per second. But we "can't always have what we wanna". At least not immediately.
Just a bunch of people far removed from the concept of delayed gratification risking far too much in order to satisfy their desires instantly. Tunnel vision. Face saving. The metaphorical pound of flesh. Misguided disobedience to (intellectual) authority. It's just so disappointing if it works. I expect more.
TLDR: Some people have publicly opposed segwit for nonsensical technical reasons and refused to double the blocksize for 6 months now while screaming that the blocksize must be increased (?!?!). Now they're suddenly OK with segwit if everyone agrees to do a hard fork. And if they don't agree, they threaten to continue to hold the network hostage. Pardon me if I don't feel like playing along.

segwit2x is technically plain old segwit plus a base blocksize increase. If you're OK with that, you're OK with plain old segwit *from a technical standpoint*.
That's all that counts. Signalling != voting.
Everyone who is OK with SegWit + hard fork but not OK with SegWit alone is admitting to playing politics. They can't make a good argument for a 2mb hard fork alone, so they make it a condition for something everyone wants. To this day it's still unclear why exactly they're so keen on a hard fork. Tread carefully.
In the past they acted as if they have technical objections to SegWit. Those do not seem to be there anymore, so why not go BIP141 immediately. What's the reason?


One could ask the question why Jihan &amp; co are still signalling for BU.


I don't know, but BIP148 is an attempt to force them. But until exchanges etc are onboard, it won't work.
Anyway, the NY agreement smells like compromise for the sake of compromise, which sets a dangerous precedent, IMHO.

I'm not.


Core has not been "stalling". They're against a relatively dumb blocksize increasing hard fork as a kick-the-can-down-the-road scaling solution, for very good reasons that have been argued in detail again and again by multiple people.


Stop the lies. They (= attending individuals, not "core") held up their end of the Hong Kong agreement, despite F2Pool violating the terms shortly after the meeting by running Classic. Talk about dishonesty.


It is a blocksize increase, not something equivalent to one. And while it's not a significant *scaling* improvement, it is a very significant *scalability* improvement. Short term: Schnorr signatures (~30% more capacity), medium term: Lightning Network (all implementations currently require SegWit).


There is enough of a solution available: A doubling of capacity via SegWit, plus 30% via Schnorr, plus a god-knows-what percent increase via Lightning Network.
Also: [0-10 satoshi/byte transactions are currently getting included into blocks.](
You're just reurgitating old and debunked talking points. Just open your eyes for gods sake. Take a step back and try to be objective. Don't assume bad faith, because there is absolutely none coming from core or blockstream.

The SegWit that's available for over half a year now *is* "2mb blocks". Actually, "up to 4mb blocks". What you're talking about are "up to 8mb blocks".


Which would solve exactly nothing as that other crypto will have similar scaling issues. If not, than it doesn't provide the same benefits as bitcoin and is not really an alternative.


I'm sorry, but if you read that blog post and that's your response, than you're not realy qualified to talk about any of this.


Again, other cryptos have the same underlying issue. People who misunderstand bitcoin might switch, though. At least until that other coin goes belly up.


I don't. I already told you that I think the blocksize will be increased in some form or another when it absolutely needs to. If that's going to be via hard fork, extension blocks, sidechains or something else, I don't know. Nor do I care.
But even if it's stuck at SegWit's 2mb: The blocksize will increasingly limit only the number of users (through necessary on chain open/close transactions) bitcoin can support and not the number of transactions per second. As many types of transactions don't need to be on chain anymore with LN, they can be done in arbitrary volumes.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:37:34


This is completely missing the point. Why is the 2MB hard fork that important? What's the rationale for it? Why the need to bargain for it? Why block progress in order to get that through? Going from a 1MB magic number to a 2MB magic number SOLVES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. And for those extra 1024 kilobytes that certain individuals are trying to cram down the throat of people who oppose irrational behaviour and bullying tactics like that, we take on significant risk of a permanent chain split. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
If there's a good technical argument to be made for a 1MB-&gt;2MB hard fork, then fucking make it already. If you can't then how about reflecting on that a bit and stop throwing a tantrum (not *you* specifically).
Don't confuse this with an argument against any blocksize increase whatsoever. We will need one eventually. That much is absolutely clear to everyone. If it can be done in a backward compatible way, then great. If not, then there will be a hard fork at some point.


The games are being played *right now*. A doubling of capacity has been readily available for over 6 months now. Technical objections were either made up or are not relevant anymore as signatories of the segwit2x agreement must be fine with the segwit part or else they wouldn't have signed it. If you have no objections to SegWit, activate it. The fact that you would like a 2MB hard fork pretty please is completely irrelevant until you can argue for it independently. Why is this so hard to understand?

My point is that doing things right takes time and sometimes you have to wait a little longer to get the best possible outcome.
It's called delayed gratification and children who are able to control their impulses this way are usually much more successful in life later on (there have been studies on that). For an example of an impulsive child in this context, just look at Ver.
The sad part is that a doubling of capacity has been available for 6 months now. If SegWit had activated immediately, we might already have Schnorr signatures at this point which would provide an *additional* 60% capacity over what we have right now with non-SegWit 1 MB blocks.
Bitcoin is held hostage by very few individuals with sadly much influence in terms of hashrate. Coincidentally, they're the ones profiting from high transaction fees the most right now.

Absolutely not true AFAIK, but please, convince me otherwise. Note though that Adam Back suggesting 2-4-8 on twitter is not "core agreeing to a hard fork". In any case, even if what you say was true, the timeline would be years not months.


Please acknowledge this simple, indisputable fact: Shortly after the Hong Kong agreement F2Pool violated said agreement by running Classic. And *despite* that, Luke Jr still held up his end by providing a hard fork proposal he felt comfortable suggesting to the community (as it was requested). They got what they asked for, but not necessarily what they wanted. The argument that the attending core contributors broke the agreement is a lie and a distraction plain and simple.
F2Pool starting to signal SegWit a year after all that happened is completely irrelevant.


Pure fantasy.

Source? This doesn't make sense to me. It's highly dependent on the type of transactions being done. E.g. when LN is deployed and people start using it, we might see a ton of previously infeasible microtransactions being done on top if it. This could potentially far exceed "12-14tx/s".
We can always measure on-chain tx/s, but trying to measure tx/s including transactions within lightning network payment channels doesn't make sense as that is virtually unlimited.

Again, you severly misunderstand how it works. My hunch is that you're explicitly searching for talking points that fit your narrative and simply repeat them here without having any insight whatsoever.


Wrong again. We want to keep the base layer as lean as possible. Why scale through a mechanism thats orders of magnitute less efficient than others? Blocksize is the last place you want to go to to increase scale. We will get there at some point, but it's not necessary today with SegWit, Schnorr and LN. Also not for a couple of years, really. The fact that the transaction backlog mysteriously cleared recently and even some free transactions are getting confirmed is another indication of that. And no, it's not a sign of bitcoin dying, ffs.
You have to accept some truths even if they don't fit your narrative or else I can't even pretend to take you seriously.


Will you build something compatible or do you just sit there and demand the LN developers do it for you? For free?


Well, "Go SegWit!" then.


That talking point doesnt age well.


The current LN implementations are very much not compatible with BU.


This idea that keeping the blocksize limit is a scheme to promote LN is so ridiculous. The argument is: hey why do we *need* to increase the blocksize with this kind of thing available to us? Especially after SegWit already *doubles* said blocksize in an opt-in way?


You're just very, very ignorant then.

OK, enlighten me! What did you mean by that other than what I read into it? What kind of influence do you think their boss has over them for what reason?


Why are you struggling with the concept that some employees can essentially do whatever the fuck they want over there. Adam has zero influence in his role as "boss" over their engineering decisions. He can "influence" them by arguing his case well. That's about it. You brought "boss" into it -- why?


'A boss' usually has very much influence over his employees by threatening to fire them if they don't do what he says. In this case however, this kind of influence is nullified by contract. Why is this so hard to understand?


Healthy people can. Some people can't, heck that's the reason rbtc exists. Anyway, you brought that point up -- what even did you mean by it? Do you fear Maxwell suddenly changes his mind and wants to destroy bitcoin? If not, please explain what you mean and I'll try to understand you.

Well that's your own fault then. It's in the one-sentence abstract of the BIP: *"The block size limit is reduced to a reasonably safe value (optional), and gradually increased over time, eventually expanding beyond the current limits."*
Furthermore: *"it is hoped this proposal will be uncontroversial and thus able to attain consensus from the entire community at the very least as a better failure scenario than the current "1 MB forever"*


No, he was the core contributor to provide a 2mb-4mb HF proposal (with implementation) as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core.
Which is what he did. Well, actually no. His proposal grows to ~31mb so he overshot by quite a bit.
The thing everyone has a problem with is of course the fact that it only starts exceeding the current 1MB limit seven years down the road. But a schedule for the actual increase was never part of the HK agreement, it is however required to satisfy a prerequisite that *was* part of the agreement: it makes the hard fork something the attending core contributors could actually *recommend* to their peers in some form or another.
The fact that Luke was open to tweaking the parameters towards are shorter timeframe didn't get much attention.

My point is that fees are not solely driven by the blocksize, but also by the exchange rate fluctuations. Thus you cannot "fix" high fees by only increasing blocksize. If we double the blocksize and Bitcoin continues to $4000, then we're exactly where we're at now. Assuming that 2x blocksize = 1/2 fees, which I'm actually not very sure of.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:03:23


He says the block size *limit* would be 8MB, which is true. He doesn't say anything about expected average block sizes.


A bold claim as most Android and iOS wallets will probably be on auto-update. Webwallets are of course too.


Do you have an example? Usually when I see someone accusing any core developer of that, they're just unable to recognize important distinctions they make (e.g., see above).
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:16:59
If no transactions make use of the available extra space, then yes, the blocksize would be 1MB. This is highly unlikely though as 80%+ of nodes are already running a SegWit compatible client.
The alternative is to force everyone to upgrade and use the new transaction format (= hard fork).
Are you saying you would prefer SegWit if it was forced upon you and everyone else?

While that's *certainly* not the case across the entire Android userbase, I also think that only a minority of bitcoin users do that on android.

How can you say this with a straight face? Again, incredibly dishonest.
Most of the opposition to SegWit comes from *one guy* and 1-2 of his friends. Among them, they have what... 50-60% of hashpower? Either directly owned or *heavy* influence over it.
Most companies either [prefer BIP141 or find it acceptable]( 80%+ of nodes are running it already.
And before you start (because your talking points are predictable): rule changes are not subject of "Nakamoto Consensus". It requires a common ruleset to funtion, it cannot help define it. Rules are defined by the people who follow them. You either join them or build a different chain. Rules are *not* defined by miners. Cooperating miners can (and should) help implement rulechanges as safe as possible, nothing more, nothing less. If they refuse, they play a dangerous game. The only voice they have in this is "hey, we cannot implement those changes for technical reasons". Beyond that, we're not asking them in their role as miners for their opinion.

Even at 40%, 20% or 10% the point remains the same: 2-3 people do not represent such a share of bitcoin users. Saying SegWit support is at 30% is at best misleading. It's clear that the vast majority of developers, businesses and users support SegWit. It's only *miner support* that is at 30%. Miners are confusing signalling for readiness with voting.


This implies that he really wants to. I'm pretty sure he doesn't even run Unlimited, just signals it with core. (I have no basis for that belief other than that it would be insane to run BU in production and that hashrate doesn't collapse when the vast majority of BU nodes are crashing due to bugs).

Why are you not hyped up? It's everything you want bitcoin to be, but actually in a doable and very efficient way.
Contrary to Paypal or VISA, we retain decentralization and censorship resistance and gain faster &amp; cheaper transactions that don't require identity or an account anywhere.
Acting all unimpressed with this is ridiculous. You don't want LN to actually work well, because then your whole crusade would be for nought.
You don't want to be shown wrong and this is driving everything you do and believe. Every single reply of yours is motivated by this. Bad news: you simply are. Get the fuck over it already. Grow up.
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:00:18


Who says blocksize won't increase? It's just the last place you want to go to to increase scale, because it's the least efficient. You want to be very conservative here. If we actually *need* to increase the blocksize (e.g. the system doesn't work without an increase), it will be far less controversial. This is why there's currently research being done on the topic of hard forks and how to do them as safe as possible.
Also, LN will reduce the number of on-chain transactions necessary. A certain class of transaction, e.g. everything &lt;$30, could more or less vanish from bitcoin's blocks. To a degree, actual blocksizes will increase with the number of users and their opening and closing of channels and less so with the number of transactions those users do.
We can either go from 3.5 tps to 7 tps to 14 tps (by doubling blocklimits), or just go to effectively ∞ tps (by being clever).


It won't. It really is as simple as that. We could also discuss the effects a meteorite crashing down on earth has on bitcoin and the lightning network for that matter.

Fight over blockspace is fought with BTC denominated numbers. Wallets have no reason to consider the BTC &lt;&gt; USD exchange rate when choosing the fee.
BTC denominated fees increased by a factor of 10 in the last 12 months.
USD denominated fees increased by a factor of 41 in the same timeframe.
Fees are getting higher, yes. But most of the effect is attributable to the quick increase in price.
So keep in mind that whatever bigger blocks (via SegWit or base blocksize hardfork) do to fees, an increase in price that we all hope for will probably offset it. Relatively high fees are here to stay, until we move most of the load off to e.g. the Lightning Network. The days of super cheap or even free transactions are more or less gone. They were a lie financed by inflation, anyway.

Yes, by a factor of 10x.
The fight for blockspace if fought with BTC denominated values. Those fees increased by 10x in the last year. But since BTC also gained in value, it's 41 times as expensive to send a transactions if you measure cost in fiat. Which most people of course do. Thus bitcoin's rise in price has a significant effect on the fee situation. (It shouldn't really, as the cost of mining a block is rooted in fiat, but here we are.)
Suppose SegWit cuts fees in half, if bitcoin continues to appreciate we will be in the same situation pretty quickly even if the transaction volume remains the same.

If you spin one up, it'll need to catch up with the rest of the network first, which is a time consuming and resource intensive process. After that it shouldn't be a problem, at least if you leave the number of allowed connections limited.
You'll need some free disk space, though. Currently, the blockchain is ~130GB.
There have been a few recent changes that speed up the bootstrapping process and limit disk usage, but I'm not really up to date on that front.

No, you misunderstood. The currently suggested fee is around 0.001 BTC and worth around $2.60. The same amount of BTC was worth $0.65 a year ago. So the current BTC denominated fee, which is a product of the block space demand, is around $0.65 if you use the exchange rate from a year ago.
But Bitcoin's rapid appreciation makes that a whopping $2.60 today.

Bitcoin is perfectly fine. It currently is just not exactly what you want it to be. But the reasons for that are simply technical realities, not a matter of opinion or policy.
Here's the good news, though: very bright minds are working on solutions that would not only bring bitcoin to VISA level capacity, but surpass that by several orders of magnitude. Instant confirmation times, near zero fees. All the things you misunderstood bitcoin to be and more, but this time for real.
All we need to get there ASAP? A little cooperation. It didn't even have to come to these extremes if miners had just activated SegWit 6 months ago which was absolutely in their power. Jihan claims he wants bigger blocks while he mines empty ones, blocks blocksize increases and is stuffing his pockets with the unnecessary high fees being paid.
The rhetoric pushed by Roger and Jihan is just a distraction. Jihan is most likely just stalling as much as possible, while a confused Roger Ver is probably just a useful idiot to him.

@_date: 2017-06-19 13:43:11


Fails to disclose? This is the hallmark segwit feature compared to an increase via hard fork (when only looking at the blocksize aspect).




*"imagine a scenario where the mempool has 10MB worth of transactions in it, which are all legacy style."*
Legacy style transactions will be generated by legacy nodes. Hence, no upgrade -&gt; no increase.


A feeling I share. But I don't see the negative connotation or think that it needs to be pointed out for some important reason. It's a logical consequence of the fact that it's opt-in. In any case, we'll see segwit's 2MB blocks sooner than with any prudent hard fork alternative.

Not sure if I agree with this. First of all, it depends on what you define as a microtransaction. Then there's certainly some threshold where legacy system simply don't work that well. For credit card transactions it's usually at a few bucks, AFAIK. The likes of Apple may have special agreements with VISA, Mastercard &amp; co, but for the rest a $0.69 credit card transaction will cost a merchant a lot more money than it's worth.
"Locking up funds" is, I think, a misunderstanding in how Lightning Network will work out in the long term (if successful). Excluding cold wallets for long term savings: if everyones bitcoin's are locked up in the lightning network -- is any of it really "locked up"?
Volatility risk is also not a long term problem. With more and more people moving into crypto, this issue will slowly disappear.

Bitcoin is neither.
@_date: 2016-07-15 05:24:58
Bitcoin does have non-speculative demand as a decentralized, censorship resistant method to securly transfer digital value tokens from A to B, globally and relatively fast. Uncontrolled by any single person, company or government.
There is nothing else in this world that has these traits.
The speculation is about how much that is worth.
The use as a currency is currently as unimportant as it is with gold. At some point it will just make sense, but currently it doesn't for most of the world.
The decorative demand for gold is grounded in its speculative value. If gold at some point isn't associated with wealth anymore, this demand will vanish as well.

It's a good general purpose compression algorithm, but it has been subject of exploits in the past and I don't know why you're so confident that this won't happen in the future. The point is that it adds complexity and attack surface for a very small benefit.

@_date: 2017-06-11 06:33:25
Tell me where I'm wrong:
- The objections to BIP141 were technical in nature (assuming good faith here, folks).
- `segwit2x` is the exact same BIP141 (with signalling moved to bit 4), plus a 1MB increase of the non-witness data inside a block, via hard fork.
- The SegWit part and the 2MB HF part are independent of each other from a technical viewpoint.
- By approving/supporting `segwit2x`, you also state that you're fine with the SegWit part of `segwit2x` -- again, from a technical viewpoint.
If you are fine with SegWit, which is a pre-requisite to supporting `segwit2x`, why not activate it right now via the currently active deployment procedure that has been available for months and underwent rigorous tests.
Is it possible that, for unknown reasons, you only want to get the 2MB hard fork through and try to tack in onto something everyone wants? Because you can't argue for it independently?
Also, why is AntPool still signalling for BU?
you're welcome to respond as well.

Well, then 80% are ok with SegWit. The fact that the concrete proposal the 80% figure is attached to included a base blocksize increase doesn't change that. 80% is fine with SegWit technically.

I certainly won't and if $100+ fees are at some point the norm, then this would simply mean that decentralized p2p cash for everyday use is impossible to do and bitcoin has pivoted to something it can actually be.

You can run a fullnode on your CPU (no need for GPU), but that node is only really meaningful if you use it to decide wether or not to accept a transaction.

It's easy to criticize this decision if you don't have to deal with the consequences of allowing such topics. Communities fall apart all the time because of a worsening signal-to-noise ratio.
There's a lot of stuff being deleted all the time and no one bats an eye because it's uncontroversial. Begging, advertising, referral links, scams, ... The problem is that some people took offense in defining something they think is great as noise that needs to be filtered out.
It's perfectly fine to then go ahead and make your own forum. But the victimization, censorship claims and temper tantrums are ridiculous.
Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of that moderation policy as well. Giving controversial hard fork related submissions some kind of flair would've been sufficient, IMHO. But I could be wrong. In any case, it's decision. It's moderation, NOT censorship.


It's a very legitimate appeal to the authority of the experts on the issue. People who can't differentiate might as well discard e.g. eye witness testimoney as "appeal to authority".

"The fee required to likely get into the next block is currently 450 satoshis/byte. For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 101,700 satoshis."
Better? :)


That too, but you have to differentiate: Suggested fee (as defined above) was 0.0001 BTC a year ago and is 0.001 BTC today. That's a ten-fold increase. *That's* the result of the increased block space demand. The 41x fee increase in terms of USD (what people work with) is due to block space demand plus price appreciation. Comparing $0.65 with $2.60 is only looking at the latter.

Same boat here. I agreed a lot with Gavin a couple of years back. He seemed very level-headed, calm, open and able to admit when he was wrong or didn't know something. Simply a nice guy. I value all of that immensely and I'm sad seeing him fall from grace like that.
While looking at tech growth in the past especially from Gavin's 3D graphics perspective, big blocks didn't seem to be that huge of a deal. So why not? Why is core refusing to do that? They're letting perfect be the enemy of the good! They're overengineering things! They're arrogant and unable to admit defeat! They're hiding something!
The difference is I didn't stop there. I started to look into their motivations which didn't turn out to be nefarious. The more time I spent understanding the issues, the clearer the picture became. Their position started making sense. I started to realize that they didn't overcomplicate things, I oversimplified them. This shit is really complicated, sometimes counterintuitively. After all, what's 1MB today? That's below floppy disk level!
But here's another simplification for you: You don't need to do days of research to pick a side here.
If you're on the fence of this issue and/or don't have a deep understanding of it, I urge you to trust the prominent/active core contributors. If you're against core and/or simply can't trust them, justify your distrust. Why are they not trustworthy? Or why do you think you know better than all these developers that have helped this project grow in an insanely successful way in the past years. Why are the opinions of politicians or self proclaimed economic experts supposed to weigh more than the analysis of those engineers? After all, at this stage the whole discussion revolves around technical realities. Don't take any shortcuts, really argue why their expert opinion is not to be trusted. If you can't, then maybe you should stop acting like you know better, because you don't.

Everybody by either running or not running a specific implementation. For the core project, the core contributors make those decisions.
Some people want to run the show but are not capable of doing it themselves so they just demand the changes they want (for whatever misguided reason) from the core contributors.
You can argue your way out of this "scaling conflict" pretty easy with common sense, some critical thinking and logic. Sadly, a few rather loud individuals are incapable of doing that. Most people are leaving it up to the experts, as we all should (with some constraints). Those few just don't trust them. "They're trying to sell us something, I tell ya! They wanna fuck is over!

- Unnecessary/premature changes are generally bad.
- `SegWit` = ~2mb block size.
- More precisely, `SegWit` is "up to 4mb" while `SegWit2x` is "up to 8mb" and a 8mb block size might very well be bad.
- Increasing block sizes increases the resource requirements on fullnodes, which are an important part of the ecosystem, but sadly not directly incentivized.

Not realistically. Sure, if you have only one peer and don't use the connection for anything else, then maybe, some people can. If you have the default 8 peers, or want to use the connection for anything else (netflix? web? games?), or don't have access to a fast enough connection (which is probably true for the vast majority of internet users), then no.
And again, this completely ignores bandwidth from bootstrapping or catching up other clients and transaction relaying. I don't have concrete numbers but I don't think that's insignificant. And it completely breaks down during peaks, even with 50% reserve.


Well, why do you think that is? 


Haven't we observed the contrary in the past? Bitcoin skyrocketed in popularity, but absolute number of fullnodes came down AFAIK.


Depends on how much connections you want to allow to your node. It will certainly be far higher than whatever VISA is charging you to use their network. Simple reason: VISA's architecture is *far* more efficient than bitcoin (w/o Lightning).

Via Lightning Network and things like it, but not by using primarily the blocksize to scale.


Because they're fine with the risk, obviously. But that won't dictate the direction of the bitcoin core project and neither should it. Especially if you're far better off using Lightning Network eventually.
Businesses can't just enter the bitcoin space and demand everyone to dance to their tune. The core project will push the technology to it's limits. It doesn't have to follow schedules set by businesses. Especially when most of those businesses haven't spent a dime on development.
If there's a mediocre way of doing something and a far superior one, the core project will choose the latter even if development takes longer. They will work together with businesses to help them to an extent, but business interests will not drive development.

@_date: 2017-06-07 05:03:56
No, let's do those together.


For simplicity sake, let's define "VISA level" as what VISA actually does, not what it's capabable of. Ignoring peaks, that's around 1700 transactions per second.
Bitcoin can currently process a theoretical maximum of 7 tps with the practical max being more or less half of that. Let's say 1MB blocksize = 3.5tx/s. So to get to "VISA level" only by means of increasing blocksize, we'd need ~500MB blocks. That's 25 terabyte of blockchain growth per year.
500MB means if I run a node that's simply relaying a block to another block every 10 minutes, I'd need at least a 7mbit/s up- and downstream to make it in time. A popular ISP in germany offers 400mbit/s and down- 10mbit/s upstream for around $45. So my bitcoin fullnode at home would utilize around 70% of my upstream, 24/7. This would *severely* degrade my internet experience in terms of latency. Websites would load more slowly, games would be unplayable. This means I would need a dedicated internet connection only for my fullnode (which isn't possible most of the time for residential connections).
Now you say, OK it's maybe not possible today but certainly in a few years.
Things can improve a lot and still be untenable for home run nodes as a constant upstream does impact internet performance even at lower levels. Then there are of course many more complexities. First of all there's a lot more traffic than only one block every 10 minutes (tx relay, bootstrapping other nodes, relay to more than one). And usually you get the best speeds to and from well connected servers -- my p2p connection to some guy in halfway around the globe would look a little different. I'd also need hardware that's capable of verifying 500mb blocks in a timely fashion, you probably can't just run in in the background on you home PC. So we need a decent CPU and enough RAM for the mempool.
In any case, it becomes apparent quite quickly that the cost and requirements of running a node from home would quickly exceed what people have available or are realistically willing to pay for if you look at blocks of that size.
Keep in mind that this only covers average transactions rates, not peak rates which we would also need to handle (think christmas). And we're no where near "VISA level" if you define it as what VISA is capable of (more than 14x).

Who is telling you that bitcoin will never able to handle more than 3.5tx/s? Whoever it is, ignore him immediately.
To correct *your* analogy: it would be like some engineer in 1911 telling you that he can't currently build you a safe plane that's able to carry 100 tonnes of payload, and anybody who suggests otherwise should just shut up and listen to engineers.


And where do they flee to when those blockchains have exactly the same problems? Or make sacrifices on the key value proposition of bitcoin/cryptocurrencies in order to keep up with demand.


Even if that were true, what are you going to do about it if that's just a reality? You act like every problem is magically solved by removing the blocklimit... without introducing any new problems at all.


That's such a bullshit metric. I can build a shitcoin with 1 trillion coins supply, make a tiny trade at a $1000 price point and pump up it's market share to levels unheard of. Great. That's more or less what Dash and many other cryptocurrencies are. Fueled by hopium of latecomers. It's more or less meaningless at this point.

They probably run as many miners as they can themselves (electricity is the bottleneck). They covertly use ASICBOOST to get a 15% edge over the hardware they sell to their customers, meaning the hardware they sell is not even really competition for their own mining op. Meanwhile they stall progress, manipulate the fee market and make even more money with transaction fees.
Triple dipping.
I think they're realizing they approach the end of the road for that strategy. SegWit will get activated, the hard fork will not happen and they can complain again about the violation of an agreement (hey, it worked for the Hong Kong one), save face &amp; keep up the narrative of evil core.

Assuming LN is fully deployed and widely used: I would use the existing channel I established a couple of days ago with another merchant to instantly pay for my NewEgg order by routing the payment over several hops to NewEgg's LN enabled BitPay or Coinbase endpoint. The transaction fee would be ridiculously small.
edit in response to your edit:


It's actually way cooler than that. Channels can stay open for a while and be reused for other payments by routing the payments through the Lightning *Network*. From one payment channel to another. All without invoking the blockchain, as long as everyone stays honest.

I'm almost certain that he's speaking of the various addresses the coins moved to.
If you're "certain" that he means they know *who* has them from that clip, you're engaging in wishful thinking.

Absolutely correct!


Also correct.
The problem is this: the users that pay those fees measure the cost in fiat.
If the USD price had been constant for the last year, we'd currently be looking at fees of around $0.65 per transaction. But instead, people are paying and complaining about $2.60 per (median sized) transaction.

"Empty account"?
Look, maybe it's your favorite field in the world, but it *is* a pseudoscience. It doesn't follow the scientific method as you cannot run tests on the economy in a controlled environment.

This shows a very deep misunderstanding on how Blockstream is structured. Neither the investors nor the CEO can order Wuille or Maxwell to work on something bitcoin related they don't want to.
Also, for the trillionth time: blockstream is not core. Some of the core developers work at blockstream (because they founded it). There are many more contributors that don't work there and blockstream is not in control of the github repo.

Humor is highly subjective. Please stop trying to impose your taste on everyone else. Thank you very much.
