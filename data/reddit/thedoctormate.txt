Hi, also new to Bitcoin and from the UK, but I've figured out how to buy on GDAX now and successfully have done. You have to top up your GDAX account using funds in your Coinbase account. Right now you can't have GBP in Coinbase, so your best option is probably EUR.
If you go straight through your bank you'll use SEPA and will be charged a fee - usually not loads, but for me it was enough that I found an alternative with no fees, that just took a few days to get verified.
First, get the apps 'Revolut' and 'Fire Personal' and get verified and set up on them. You need Revolut to convert from GBP to EUR for free, and since Revolut no longer supports Coinbase, you need Fire for that. (Edit: I've been corrected in the replies, it can all be done with Revolut now.)
You want to move your GBP from your bank into your Revolut account, then convert it to EUR in Revolut, with no fee.
Next, send your EUR from Revolut to Fire, and from Fire to Coinbase. Once this has gone through you can put your EUR in your Coinbase wallet into your GDAX wallet.
It does sound a bit dodgy, and all you have is my word, I was skeptical at first so I just tried it with a tenner but it worked fine for me and I've been using it since! As I say, it just took a few days to process and get verified.
If you have any questions feel free to message me.

When was the last time you did it? I heard they shut it down a couple of weeks ago.

Ah cool thanks for that explanation! I'll definitely be using that in the future then.
