@_date: 2015-12-17 12:12:36
He is correct. I am sorry but you are not quite right. In early stages, speculators see bitcoin as a store of value, a speculative assets because they believe that Bitcoin is/will be a good payment network while it is scarce.
When time goes on, Bitcoin can not rely on speculators because network effects that provide Bitcoin with liquidity is quite limited. When speculators lose their patience because they can't see how bitcoin can attract more user due to it fails to work as a payment network, they go away. Bitcoin may go nowhere. It will fail as a good store of value when its value drops fast against EUR or USD or CNY. That's why Bitcoin need more and more user.
To work as a good store of value, Bitcoin must work as promised: a good payment network whose liquidity can be guaranteed by growing user base. New user may not consider bitcoin a long/medium term store of value but a medium of exchange only. Merchants may exchange bitcoin for USD immediately right after they receive it, making it effectively a medium of exchange or a very short term store of value. If amount of bitcoin used in daily transactions are huge, it improves end users confidence, making them keep bitcoin in their wallet for longer time. If that situation keeps improving, bitcoin effectively becomes a store of value.
And yes, payment network went/goes first as the first bitcoin network's utility. Store of value follows because of its network effect, liquidity and its ability to attract more user via its payment network.

Agreed. I see no good proposal to measure it


I see that too. I don't know why people like it a lot. It seems to me that most of people don't understand it. I agree that sidechains can take away some transactions from bitcoin. As the results, sidechains can be off-chain databases which help reduce the burden for bitcoin network. However, we will have N + 1 database to maintain.The problem is N sidechains are modeled on M security level which can be never on a par with Bitcoin.

It looks like that the bloat blockchain forces end user out. High latency blockchain synchronization is really annoying experience. Normal users don't want to open Bitcoin-QT wallet any more. Instead, they depend on Coinbase, Blockchain.info to manage their wallets. 
If there is no big changes in term of technology advance or market adoption, Bitcoin network will be driven toward more centralized no matter what block size limit is. I want to see if pruning-enabled Bitcoin-QT can be a rescue.
What I really think is at this time, weak hands get out. Strong hands stay. Bitcoin network centralization reaches a threshold. It is good time to increase block size limit. If Bitcoin can not survive it, Bitcoin is not our future. It is just too weak and vulnerable.

If you think that because of scarcity, Bitcoin has its value, you have flawed economic thinking. It is totally speculation which is driven by thoughts of scarcity and possible mass adoption. Nobody cares about your own *scarce* assets if no one accepts it. No one invests into Bitcoin because he thinks Warren Buffett will buy it one day. Yet another rich greater fool?
Every VC ventures out there invest into Bitpay, Coinbase, Xapo because they believe in Bitcoin's mass adoption. Remember remittance market?
People will be attracted into Bitcoin because it is cheap, fast, cross-border, friction-less, *everybody-around-me-use-it* and easy to exchange for local currency, not because of its scarcity. They are not speculators or price action traders.
Mass adoption must go first. Bitcoin network effect must be expanded constantly. Or you and me become greedy bag holders. I don't think competitive altcoins stay still in term of network effect.
Bitcoin *may* have a chance to replace gold. However, it is very far future when bitcoin becomes a world currency.


You claim yourself as a bitcoin expert. Please choose your wording carefully. "Block limit" is not *effective* block size. When a doctor says I can live 200 years for maximum, he does mean that I can live for 200 years. 
Also, how *heavy* is *too heavy*? In 2010, I never downloaded a 1.5Gb movie from torrent because I though it was too big. In 2015, I downloaded +80 3-4.5Gb. Technology changes. My standard changes.  guys (Adam Back, Gregory ...) and Viacoin guys (Peter Todd, btcdrak) eats too much FUD and too little meaningful facts about decentralization without giving any clear definition on how to measure its metrics, capacity planning and why. 6000 full nodes to some people are too many. 5000 makes no difference. However, a baby can cry wolf for that.
Also, bitcoin is not only blockchain-based payment network. If it is too crowded (+500 million users?), it will push people out when it hits the limit. There is no such a single market in a city. However, to reach that adoption, 20Mb block size is not enough.
No one can expect mass adoption by embracing "wait and see" strategy as suggested by  devs


The question is why "small club of people" want to transact in bitcoin, not  Why do people want to use bitcoin while they know their transaction is not stored on bitcoin blockchain? Off-chain means other blockchains or database but not bitcoin blockchain. There is no difference to using an altcoin at all. "small club of people" means no network effect. Do you remember that 140k transactions (recent stress test) took 8 hours to settle? Now you and me are part of such "small club of people". If Bitcoin is able to serve *small club of people* *only*, it is over-priced. Traders quit, I quit.

It is possible technically. But no one will do it. It defeats the purpose of block chain and compromises Bitcoin security. I think that you are over-simplify the situation

Basically, I think Adam's proposal is seeking for more technical problems short term and long term without making any progress.

That article provides nothing new. He just thinks that he can borrow some ideas behind Bitcoin blockchain to build up a shared banking app. However, blockchain as in a time-stamped server is invented to make bitcoin transactions work in a decentralized manner. If you don't need decentralization, there are tons of better ways to build a banking app that is built on top of a shared, replicated database or centralized application server which provides RESTful API. Have the author ever thought about the other solutions? Also, the author ignores the security implications of a P2P network.
The idea of a single banking ledger for the world is novel. It ignores the political issues and business secrets between banks within a trusted network.

Miner can't do it themselves. Please remember that SW is a new type of transactions. SW does not work with tranditional transactions. In theory, if mempool fills with most SW transactions, miner can pack more txs into a single block than it could before. It depends on user adoption. I don't think SW transactions can be popular in 1-2 years.

@_date: 2016-01-18 19:36:19
You misunderstand how SW works.


Miner can not do it themselves. It depends on users. If user adoption is low, SW has nearly no effect. SW is a new type of transaction. User needs to send funds to new type of address, using new type of transaction. Our current address type does not work with SW. 
More details: 


Seem not so logical. Fee is still the same before and after SW. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 04:26:10
Sidechains can be used to create tokens which have no speculative value (because of fixed exchange rate with bitcoin). Then they have no financial incentives, possibly no network effect. Then there is no incentive for miners to protect them as seen in altcoins
I think that sidechains can be used in private blockchains. Not feel safe if they are open networks.

Bitcoin is not recognized by law in Vietnam, neither currency or goods. No one controls Bitcoin-related activities.

NY finance officers make New Yorkers' life harder and spend more money in buying/selling Bitcoin. I want to correct your post's title: 
**New York financial regulators laughing at Bitcoiners is like French laughing at Poland when Nazi's invaded there.**
It would be much more correct in the current situation in US. Fortunately, EU is much more friendly to Bitcoin. There is still a hope.
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:14:35
I really want to ask developers who work on permissioned block chains
1. *Without unit of account, how do you validate transactions?* E.x cryptocurrency can track sum of coins that a user/address can spend? *Without that sum (coin or colored coin), how do you set up an transaction and/or validate them? What are actually sent out and received?*
2. Without colored coin, Bitcoin block chain is just a simple database that tracks transactions of a simple asset (bitcoin), which represents as just a number. Colored coin can be understood as a number with some additional attributes. Any complicated asset that is stored on block chain will require more attributes other than a simple number. Block chain is not designed for that. You must extend the protocol, add more opcodes. Meanwhile, document database, relational database are quite mature for such cases. Fields and tuples and documents can be used to define and control any complicated assets. *What is the benefits of using a block chain as a database over MySQL, PostgreSQL or any NoSQL (document) database like HBase, Cassandra, OrientDB ... in a private network?* I understand that there is no need for trustless technology in a corporate network which is secured by human: a group of sysadmins are trusted to protect the system.
As a software developer with more than 14 years of experience on back-end software, I have never seen anybody choose database architecture before defining requirements and system/software architecture. Then I am really confused when people praise for block chain as technology of the future in private networks.
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:30:32
No, let handle this dispute in a decentralized manner. This is a trustless technology. We need to ensure that this technology works without human intervention. Ignore core devs, Satoshi The Creator ... Let speculators define the value that provides miners with incentives to operate mining hardware. Let miners control block chains and transactions

Bitcoin is resilient. I don't worry about fork. Fork can be done by good guys (Mike, Gavin) or bad guys (any bank or government). It is important that Bitcoin miners know exactly what they should do *responsibly*.

Over-hyped, over-promised and under-delivered (intentionally). Bitcoin is coming back to its position in 2011. People will soon recognize that its current price is too high. Miners will quit the game soon after the price plummeted.
Some clueless developers keep saying about Bitcoin security without paying attention to exchange rate.
It Bitcoin development continue being manipulated this way, I do believe that Bitcoin will be called an altcoin after a couple of year.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:10:19
Keep in mind that Bitcoin community is not easy to destroy. Don't FUD. I know what you mean. Block size limit increase must be done.

I guess that Tim Swanson says so because he is about to establish a centralized money laundering company which is powered by insecure and trust-based block chain-like database which he brands as permissioned block chain to make it trendy to idiots. 
I know he is about to call Coinbase, Bitpay money laundering companies to attract attentions.
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:36:06


That's why Gavin want to increase block size limit before Bitcoin network becomes too big to accept such changes.

Permissioned ledgers and closed, centralized blockchains such as Eris, Hyperledger, Ripple etc., are built on top of politics and human decisions, not maths.
They have their own use cases. But actually, people has developed such systems for ages. Block chain-like database is just another option. They will not compete with Bitcoin, but MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL-based solutions.

Do you support BIP 101 in Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:53:24
I think he will think differently if he has some real enterprise software development experience in companies. He thinks of block chain as a hammer and everything is just a nail.
Better off to think of block chain as part of new breed of enterprise solutions. There are lots of application servers and enterprise features built on top of it that provides much more richer functions than the current blockchain-based apps. The biggest features that Bitcoin like blockchain bring to us now is trust-free, permissionless (no API key, account ...) and ability to maintain the integrity of unlimited copies of anonymous database all over the world. Do current enterprise solutions provides them or need them? No, I don't think so.

OK, so one of the bad scenario is that user deposits Bitcoin to exchange to buy Monero. All of his Bitcoin transaction will be traced. But it has nothing to do with Monero. After he withdraws Monero to his own wallet, nobody can trace him anymore.
However, the above case is easy to solve. Service like  or ShapeShift are solutions. User can buy Monero with bitcoin without revealing his identity or he can send Bitcoin to others by spending Monero.
@_date: 2016-02-19 02:10:02
Actually, it is not possible with Monero because nobody can prove which transaction belongs to who by parsing Monero's blockchain. Yes, exchanges' owners can report user's public addresses. However, public addresses are un-linked to transactions (unlike Bitcoin)

If bitcoin price drops deeply, speculators and investors will lose their interest in it. They quit. Please remember that speculators bring liquidity to bitcoin. Less buyers means lower price. What happens if bitcoin daily trading volume is just few ten thousands of dollar and there are few sell or buy orders. Volatility will be extremely high, which makes Bitcoin impractical/risky for use in e-commerce.
Higher bitcoin price does imply that more value in term of USD may be transferred over the network in a period of time

When you control ripple and stellar, you can make them into anything you want. You can change the protocol, block someone, cancel transactions without asking people's permissions. Actually, you forget Paypal offers you an internal unit of accounting called Paypal. It is a IOU for sure. However, it is still an unit of accounting.

You got the point. If you (a specific credit card owner or bitcoin user) make illegal transactions, you are to blame, not Visa (or Bitcoin). Please remember that before bitcoin, people use Paypal, credit cards, cash to do illegal transactions. Today, the same.
Please don't talk as if bitcoin was the only way or dominant way to do illegal transactions


Are you sure about that?


Decentralized or centralized is all about responsibility. If you own a thing and it goes bad, it is you to solve that issue. If you live in a community as a normal citizen, can you blame that community for bad things that are done by one or two members?

A blockchain which is centrally controlled by banks or companies like Eris (without decentralization) is just a "legacy" service which we can see everyday: post office, business registration, birth certificates ... Replacing their traditional database engines (MySQL, Oracle ...) with blockchain-like (double linked list) data structures (built on top of LevelDB, Tarantool's Sophia, LMDB ...) does not solve anything. One word for that: single point of failure (as with LibertyReserve)
Bitcoin and decentralized cryptocurrencies are born to solve that issue.
If a company steps in and says their staffs are working on their own blockchain, please say "Good luck" to them and remind them of LibertyReserve

You can say the same thing about HTTPS, cryptography, Tor and web. So what?


PyPI is a website. It is just an centralized and managed implementation. Bitcoin is not. It is a protocol, a technology and decentralized network like torrent. If you don't like that network, you can reuse bitcoin protocol in another network which is often called "altcoin". Apprently, Bitcoin can support you to illegal things in the same way you can use your Python skills to build darknets websites, use your credit cards to buy child porn. It is a fact of life. However, like any disruptive technologies, Bitcoin is not designed for that purpose.
If you think that Bitcoin technology is dangerous, I can say the same thing about your Flask framework, your credit card because how I can ensure that you will not use them for illegal purposes one day.

I just remind you of Litecoin sync. Blockchain synchronization in LTC takes much much less time than it does in BTC. Why? Because LTC market is much much smaller. It has much less transaction.
Back to BTC, 2 years ago, blockchain synchronization took much less time.
If BTC doesn't grow, there is less and less on-chain transaction which in turn leads to faster synchronization. Then? Nobody cares about Bitcoin any more.
However, for faster synchronization in any case, end user can use pruned block chain feature in Bitcoin 0.11
@_date: 2015-09-24 07:57:01
Good question. I think that if Bitcoin is Internet, 21's pool + their device network can be considered a LAN. Devices' transaction will send transactions to 21's pool only. They can be called off-chain transactions. Those transactions will be on-chain at some points in the future

Please replace "bitcoin" with "cryptocurrency" or "financial incentive token", it will make more sense. Cryptocurrency as financial incentive works in decentralized network where participants wants to reward for their timely contributions to the ecosystem which they don't own, so can't consider it their own asset. 
It is possible that some software vendors have incentive to create centrally controlled and replicated databases that provide blockchain-like services and build services on top of it. The database is their own asset. They can do mining themselves without direct financial incentives but as a security scheme to make their services operational. The reward comes from service fees (or any business charges and costs) instead of mining fees as in decentralized blockchains. To be fair, please do not call those databases blockchains. Using a trendy buzzword for crappy products does not make them cool

Define "development"?
@_date: 2015-11-26 09:19:58
Good Peter. I am glad that now you know people issues in Bitcoin development
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:14:04


Valid point. This system is controlled by BlockStream devs 
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:57:12
Weakhands feel disappointed and impatient. I found some 1k sell orders today.
Low market cap is bad signal for Bitcoiners
@_date: 2015-11-20 22:22:21
Blockstream may be backed by US government who doesn't want Bitcoin to grow up.
R3CV is backed by bankers who want to compete with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:12:08


Proof? 
@_date: 2015-11-16 09:58:42
Care to explain? It seems to be not logical to me
@_date: 2015-04-14 12:32:59
Armin Ronacher is a very good coder. But when he walks out of his tent, he is so ignorant




What's a flawed way of thinking. I do believe that I can say: Python, PyPy and his Flask framework can be used to build darknet websites. TCP/IP and HTTP are used to propagate child porn, viruses and malwares 




You hide USD 1 million of gold in your super secret house. You are dead on an accident and now what happens? 
He talked as if he had never known about sunken ship that carried many tonnes of gold 


He acts as if he was a experienced accountant who has many years working with bitcoin and accounting :))


OK. He lives in Austria. But highly developed country like Austria is not the world.
He is not a though leader. That's OK. He will not use bitcoin. That's OK. I don't use EUR too. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 18:06:36
So theymos and his supporters (Adam Back ...) are threats to Bitcoin according to aantonop?
@_date: 2015-11-20 22:19:30
Vaporware is more important than malware? Agreed.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:25:46
Ethereum even has a nicer logo
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:46:17
Define your own definition of "currency"
@_date: 2015-03-28 12:03:55
October 21st, 2014? Why is the date so old?
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:09:54
Not a sidechain. It is just an altcoin which should be banned here. 
Blockstream just created yet another centralized private blockchain-based service like R3, MultiChain 
@_date: 2015-10-09 05:07:56
Bitcoin "developers" don't want to code. Just talk, tweet, give presentations to show off only. This community is full of academics who are scared of actions. 
Don't worry. They don't bite.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:19:03
Anything new in this update?
@_date: 2015-11-10 17:02:52
Proof-of-Work benefits the richers or bigger miners. We should drop Proof-of-Work
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:08:09
There are some people in Bitcoin community that we should feel free to ignore: guys at  and Eris's Byrne
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:47:17
Good question indeed. Liquid is just an centralized service. So it is possible. Also, transactions are traceable, making it easier for finance regulators to seize account across exchanges
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:13:25
Private blockchain? What's a joke. I do think that guys at Eris Industries should rewrite their software using MySQL instead.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:47:30
Changing the PoW algorithm with a hardfork is a good way to go. Let end up the unproductive debate and continue innovating Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:19:40
I don't understand how BTC-e servers could be seized if they weren't located in the US. If I remember correctly, BTC-e servers were located in Bulgaria. There is no way FBI can come there and seize servers.
Edit: Fixed Bulgaria 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:55:11
Kim DotCom was not arrested by FBI ;)
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:07:19
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:36:35
Well said
@_date: 2015-02-24 08:17:28
A local money exchanger needs a FinCen license?
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:13:36
Please be more serious. FBI are not saints or angels. They can not bypass local law enforcement agents. They need visas to visit countries other than the US 
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:25:37
I have the same thought on the Chinese company. China has a different business culture.
Amazon? No idea. May it be too big to change fast
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:38:51
Those are Cloudflare's server, not BTC-e's 
Traffic was routed to Cloudflare's servers before being forwarded to BTC-e's 
@_date: 2016-07-20 14:04:03
Blockstream devs, Peter Todd and other Core supporters, please stop trolling Bitcoin community about hard fork risk. If you hate seeing Bitcoin's success, please leave.

Fix: Monero exists to solve the privacy problem


Lot of people (maybe not you)
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:55:13
You are right. Fixed
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:56:24
Directly? No, it is not. However, too much negative press already created a bad image for Bitcoin. Average Joe felt in-confident to buy and use bitcoin. Rakuten may make they think again.
