I would recommend [transferwise]( in cases of cash transfer rather than Western Union or your bank which are we all agree ludicrous. A simpler approach for those not using bitcoin.

So your point is that a currency is a poor investment. Currency is intended to move at a fixed rate to facilitate exchange, investments are assets that are hoped will increase in value faster than the currency. The reason the dollar is a poor investment is the central bank intends to keep dollar prices rising at a fixed rate, if they move at less than the prescribed rate a variety of monetary easing acton will be taken. The change in value of gold is not governed by a central bank rather it as a market price changing with individuals perception of its value and there desire to purchase it. So well you may not have any more gold someone else will give you more for that same gold.

To add to your point, not only is a million worth more in inflationary terms relative purchasing power is greater; this is show in detail if you at specific prices of goods. i.e. electronics prices have dropped faster than inflation.
