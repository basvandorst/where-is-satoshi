Are you sure it it 0.1 BTC and not 0.1 mBTC?
Also you can take a look at your settings. There you can choose the mining fees. There are 4 options. High priority (next block = 10min.), Normal (3 blocks = 30 min), Economy (1 hour) or low priority (2 hours).

so someone stole 250 BTC and i'am wondering what do they gone do with it?
you can follow the money via blockchain and at some point the thief will have to reveal his name.
if you want to cash out you surely need an account with your name. or if you want to buy something you will have to leave an address. 
how do the thief gets the money without being revealed or doesn't he care?

"Land of the free" is a term i heard in my childhood a lot,

The next change in difficulty (first after halving) should be in a couple of days. This could have a effect, but i don't think it will.
Any opinions on that?
