The thing has spiked 100 points in a day.... definitely trades like someone knows what's coming.
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:20:17
Funny, that's what I was doing too.

Probably nothing in the immediate term. If it gets to the point where there's a real risk the government will miss their debt payments then it'll matter.

Oh the irony. Bitcoin: one of the most innovative products out there which had nothing whatsoever to do with regulators. Eric needs to smoke some of that Colorado weed and chill.

Judging by the price action, which has been impressive, it sure as hell doesn't need the SEC.

Who cares? ETFs didn't exist 10 years ago and financial assets did just fine. This will be no different.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:44:00
I don't think it's very correlated to the $. My advice: if you want bitcoin do it because of the merits of owning an unregulated crypto currency, not because you're trying to $ hedge.

I don't need them but this is cool. I wish you luck!
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:36:46
Agree. And the fact they couldn't do anything about it tells you everything you need to know about coinbase.
I like coinbase but it's like using Etrade 3 days after it opened. No limit orders, prone to malfunction, very clunky.

Ever? Ever is a long long time. I might have missed a long.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:34:17
There is no timeframe because the SEC hasn't provided one. And you can bet your ass this is game over for both of those apps as well given their argument re: unregulated exchanges.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:20:17
I don't think they're faking technical problems. I actually think their site is too dysfunctional to handle large volumes of traffic.

Gold trades on a regulated exchange at the Merc.

Thanks. 
1) So it's worth it to pay the upfront transaction fee to acquire bitcoin for the purpose of using it indefinitely. 
2) I use coinbase and when I initiate a transaction I'm only able to use bitcoin. I'll look up Satoshi - wasn't familiar with it until just now.
3) So a miner becomes a de facto exhange for the coins they have on file? I'm a little confused about the mechanics of why a miner wouldn't just sell all their coins and exit the business once mining ends.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:35:25
So to you knowledge, none of these exchanges has done an ICO of themselves that would trade publicly?
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:52:52
Great answers. Last q - so why is anyone using Coinbase? Why not just go direct to the exchange?
@_date: 2017-01-18 18:00:55
The fee at coinbase is something like 1.5%. I'm surprised the exchanges haven't been more vocal about simply going directly to them given that spread (1.5% v 0.25% in fees).
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:28:50
Thanks! When you (or someone) has time, I'm most interested in why a non-mining machine would run like that? 
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:20:42
2 doesn't answer 1.
How does the split work, technically? How do you split a private key?
I understand the blockchain. But the blockchain exists on the computers mining the bitcoin. If mining no longer exists, how does the blockchain continue to exist?
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:59:26
Thanks for this. A few followups:
3) Does the miner collect this "tax" now or only when the ~21m coin limit is hit? Second, I realize this is over 100 years from now but will the fee the miner collects be enough to more than offset the electricity cost of keeping the machine running?
2) Technically, how does that division work? I'm assuming you don't split the private key, right? Is it as simple as just adding a zero and moving the decimal?
1) I think this gets to a question I asked above. Why does/should a place like Coinbase even exist? Why shouldn't people just simply go directly to an exchange and pay the nominal fee there and then deposit the coins into their own secure wallet? Full disclosure: I used coinbase to purchase my coins because, to be honest, I didn't know any better.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:53:46
I'll check it out. THANK YOU!
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:47:28
When you buy coins on an exchange like that (instead of using coinbase) how do you securely store them? (obviously I'm a newb at this)
On mining - does the miner collect that fee every time the coin changes hands from now to eternity? And if that's what you meant, is that conditioned on them staying up and running or could that fee get collected without maintaining the blockchain?

What a stupid idea

We're on the verge of a transactional revolution and you're worried about the velocity of BTC?! Lol. We'll be at $489579845734345/BTC before that matters.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:21:07
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:30:22
That chart depicts the average. You might have heard of it. So for every $0 transaction there's another at $5.
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:44:33
Yes, exactly my point. Either BTC gets its shit together or someone else is going to do it for them. They already are!
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:29:50
Would you rather have 100% of nothing or 1% of the next Visa?
The way EVERYONE makes money is by boosting transactions. And $2.50/per isn't going to cut it.
