Once bitcoin becomes the target of a crisis or major national crime, everyone will point the finger at bitcoin and it will be regulated. Once that happens and the dust settles, the government will create their own crypto currency.
Rhetorical question, what do you think our currency is? It’s a number not backed by anything, which is controlled by the banks and government. It is basically a block chain-less crypto digital currency. There is not nearly enough gold or paper currency to back it up. 
Downvote me all you want, I’m not wrong.

This is how you get killed

LOOKS LIKE THAT MOVE AWAY FROM GOVERNMENT REGULATED BANKS TO RANDOM COMPANIES HOLDING YOUR MONEY WASNT SUCH A SMOOTH MOVE.

Let’s break this down real quick.
“Yeah”, infers I’m in agreeance with your comment. The “ass”, is directed towards the person targeted in which we both agree. This is known as a sarcastic joke, which you didn’t get. 
I won’t even try to delve into your issues. But not only did you misunderstand my comment and who it is grammatically directed towards, but you respond with this. Immature and incorrect.

You mean I should hold my SBUX and MSFT stock long? ;)

You forgot a “0” on that grocery store bill. None of us getting out of there for $20.

What’s the story on this? I can’t help but think some type of fraud

Like a glitch in BTC or in RH?

Do you still have to pay taxes on the revenue?

Good article. 
In response to the other post, other countries will mine other “metals” and produce different currencies. But what will their investment value be? Trash, just like their currency.

I had actually originally in my head thought it was Dodson, but that’s actually a name familiar in my life so I second guessed it! Can we get a script please? Haha

My favorite part of this scene is when he pulls out  and opens the shaving cream can. It makes a squeaking/swish noise and I could never tell if it was his fat ass laughter or the can itself. 
“Don’t get cheap on me, Johnson.”
Edit: As a kid I always wanted him to make it to boat dock. I always cheered for him, but that dinoguana always got him. Every time!!

The woman asks about security and Akon says what we all know, that the security is reassured by all those who hold the blockchain data. My biggest quarrel with that is how do we know that in the future it won’t be hackable or corruptible in one way or another? We can believe in the blockchain as much as we want, but the unknown is always there.
