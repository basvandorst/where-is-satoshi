If I understand it correctly the checkpointing is centralised at the moment, all the other features of the currency are decentralised, and the checkpointing gradually gets decentralised as the currency grows (?number of peers increases?).

This is the part in which I'm interested.  Any information on how he did this?

People complaining that they hadn't received their hardware on-time, sometimes so late as to make them obsolete upon arrival, never able to recoup the outlay, made me very skittish about investing in any hardware at all.  BFL didn't just hurt their customers, they made the whole industry look like a potential scam.  Other hardware manufacturers have been hurt by this.
I pretty much just buy obsolete hardware for cheap, as a hobby, because I trust a guy on eBay with 200 stars and 100% positive feedback more than I trust any of these cats.  And that's because of BFL.

The [wikipedia article]( has a section about this but I don't fully understand the currency yet.  Gonna give the referenced PDF a read.

Have you read those links?  I'm not sure you posted the right ones; they've got almost nothing to do with what he's asking.
rgnet1 is asking about opening an image file in a common way, e.g. in Windows Photo Viewer or a web browser, and having your PC infected as a result.
The links you've posted are, in order
1) a page about an exploit in the way a version of Word handles embedded TIFF image files that can result in code being executed by Word.
2) a page with a deeper technical explanation of 1)
3) a set of presentation slides about making Apache pass JPG files to the PHP processor so that you can (specifically for websites like MySpace that don't allow the 'src' attribute to end in anything but an image-type file extension) dynamically load a different image in the same &lt;IMG&gt; element depending on other session/cookie variables, and the fact that this can be exploited as a tracking method (I don't even know how material that basic ends up at DefCon but I suppose just because he's written DefCon on it doesn't mean it actually formed part of the event).  Nothing to do with executable code hidden in images to distribute malware.
4) a page about exploitative shortcuts (LNKs) hidden in Word documents.
The only implication in the above links is that you should be careful with unknown Word documents.
- the answer to your question (can an image, opened in a browser or image viewer, cause an infection) is:
Yes, by virtue of the fact that a bug in the program you open the image in could be exploited to cause the program to execute code, but it's an unfavoured attack vector because the attack surface of an image viewer is so small and pretty much everyone running Windows (the most popular target by far for malware distribution) is opening casual images in Windows Photo Viewer.  The only precaution you can take is to keep your software up-to-date, but that's all you should ever need to protect yourself from this specific attack.  If you get infected through this it will likely be because a zero-day was exploited in your photo viewer before it got patched out by the vendor.  This is a risk for everything though and so standard opsec applies: unknown source = unknown safety.

He's invested in dozens of tech companies.  Probably not the biggest fan of the government, either.

Alright, 2 Chainz, calm down.

Daft that they would claim the paper is 'unacceptable' and then immediately tell the student to write a paper asserting a 'fact' that the student doesn't believe.  THAT's unacceptable.
What a dick.

Cool.  Do the confirmations serve only to protect against a double-spend from a non-authorative (i.e. no 51%-like problem) payer?


That's a good comparison, thanks.

"It's just business."
"What kind of business, sir?"
"Oh, don't worry, it's none of yours."

I think it's quite clear that his cynicism-based joke was about reddit and upvote-chasing, not women being able to do things.

How does the confirmations thing work there?  Do you have to wait for six confirmations before they'll pull you a pint?

From the look of it the only alternative is that Paypal has a vested interest in us not being able to encrypt our emails.  That doesn't sound very likely.

Perhaps PeerBlocker could help (if it's still a thing).

Not the same thing, but similar.  A building society is owned by its members but a credit union is also democratically run by its owner members.

Yeah this probably didn't happen.

Still being analysed by the FBI.
