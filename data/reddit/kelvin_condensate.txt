Lol what? So you believe reducing the free market reduces bubble/bust cycle? That only amplifies it since wealth is shifted towards industries of which the perceived demand does not actually exist. If it’s material goods, they sit forever unsold, and the company goes under because they invested far too much capital into something they thought was of much higher demand based on faulty information due to arrogant fucks thinking they could ‘centrally manage’ one of He most complex systems known to man. 
Oh no! Order cannot emerge from complicated human activity without an intelligent organizational factor! Also, pay no attention to natural selection and evolution! /s
Seriously though, if you think having a fixed market cap magically causes recessions, you are incredibly naive. The economic system is incredibly complex, and recessions aren’t sufficiently understood. If they were, we could predict them to some reasonable degree of accuracy (oh wait, some economic models can do that, but they are ignored by the mainstream :))

No shit it was higher. That’s why it took drastically less labor to purchase the same thing. It goes far beyond a mere increase in the money supply, but the manipulations of the Fed benefit the elites. Fiat has everything to do with that as it forms the basis of the world’s banking system (petro-fiat dollar).

No one said the graph does what you think we are assuming it does.

This is precisely it. An ad in 1960s showed a 30-06 rifle for $12.50. Minimum wage was at $4, so it took just over 3 hours to earn a rifle. 
Now, at $10 an hour, and a $500 rifle (I’m being generous here), it comes out to 50 hours worked to get the same rifle that took only 4 hours of labor just 57 years ago.

It means that you have to produce more wealth into the economy just to preserve the wealth you have already produced even if you are investing.
In fact, the extent of many a people’s investments merely go into preserving the wealth they have previously generated.

Banks would never give out such incredibly risky loans unless they knew they were backed. Sure enough, the government bailed them all out and any company they deemed “too big to fail.”
But it’s the GOP’s fault! Never mind Citibank shit out Obama’s cabinet. We live in a uniparty system of which both parties ostensibly appear at odds but in actuality both serve the elite.

You can’t compare bitcoin as it is now to what it will be when it is the dominate currency. It is a false equivalence. 
It’s behavior will be entirely different.
Also, you are nutty if you think bitcoin will be easier to control. This makes such little sense that I can’t believe you think this. 
The fed can print money, raise rates, but/sell bonds, and do loads of other manipulation, all designed to sap a little value from your money (inflation).
It Bitcoin becomes the dominate currency over fiat, it makes no fucking sense for a whale to dump bitcoin in exchange for fiat. Do the only alternative remains is that they have to purchase something. An exchange of two goods will occur, each with their own subjective value. Both people walk away satisfied; win-win. 
I truly don’t understand how you think bitcoin will be easier to manipulate **if** is becomes the dominate currency.

I never said that. But by wiping out 95% of life, the surviving 5% is free to evolve in ways impossible previously.
This is exactly what happens after every mass extinction. There is no ‘stronger,’ but there is new evolutionary paths. 
With that said, if you think global warming will cause mass extinctions, you are a fool. The scientific literature is far more ‘conservative’ with their predictions than how the media represents it.
There isn’t going to be any catastrophic mass extinction event. To say that there is is to have no knowledge of the scientific literature.
Anyway, human activity entirely unrelated to anthropomorphic climate change has a far greater effect upon species.

You’re an idiot if you think global warming is destroying the planet. Forcing life to adapt is not ‘destroying’ the planet.

Hence, we are here because the planet was ‘destroyed,’ at least according to your logic.

To start, any historical comparison is utterly laughable. Bitcoin is a *new* entity and therefore no historical data exists to compare it to that of stocks or real estate. 
Bitcoin is a currency. The increasing value of bitcoin has nothing to do with the fact that it can or cannot generate revenue and everything to do with the fact that more and more people are adopting the currency.
It is a new currency comprised of less than 1% of the world’s total currency values. If more and more people dump their monies into bitcoin, then the value of bitcoin can exponentially increase with a linear adoption rate. 
As such, point 1 isn’t even a valid *devil’s advocate* point.

If you have $1, and it is increased by 100%, you have $2. Ergo, a 100% increase is a doubling.

And if bitcoin goes up to $50k? It makes no sense that the value would drop, and if it does dip, buy the fucking dip.
It makes no sense for it to drop because the value of bitcoin is driven by how many people adopt bitcoin. Adoption rates are quite high and bitcoin is greater than 0.25% of the world’s currency.

Where did you get only 5 trillion? The sum of all currency value in the world is far, far beyond that.

@_date: 2017-11-11 06:09:41
I am not disregarding history. It is simply that you literally cannot compare something new with no historical data to that which has historical data going back decades upon decades.
Historically, a crypto-currency was never used for anything... until it was. It should be obvious that historical comparisons to things that have no historical data is absurd. 
Also, bitcoin is an entirely new currency. The only reason its value goes up is because of its adoption rate.
Ergo, all comparisons to well-established currencies is useless because classical currency analysis only considers the current state of well-established currencies with no regards for the *dynamics* of the currency. 
Comparing the *dynamics* of new currencies to the *statics* of well-established currencies is comparing apples to oranges. No useful information is extracted from such a comparison.
As such, people make naive comparisons and draw naive conclusions because two things seemingly fall into the same category with little regards for how that thing actually works.
It is analyzing a *label* instead of the actual *thing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:06:16
Why would it drop? That makes no sense. It’s price is driven by how many people adopt bitcoin. And more and more ‘normies’ are getting into all the time to the tune of 100k people per day.
If bitcoin becomes 1% of the world’s currency, it’s value would be well over $50,000 per coin. This is a gross underestimate, but I’ll be conservative to get the point across. 
I feel as if every nay-sayer is just distracted by an arbitrary destination of **one** bitcoin being worth over $9000 and declaring its at an all time high.  Shit makes no sense. 
The conditions of 2013 don’t magically apply here. Again, adoption rate is driving this value. And since bitcoin has a ‘fixed’ supply, a linear adoption could drive an exponentially increasing value.
If there isn’t a price drop, and you don’t buy, you will hitting yourself for such a monumental fuck up. If you’re right, feel free to reply at such time by calling me out. 
Also, bitcoin has been at an ‘all-time’ high for a year. The entire point is that bitcoin isn’t saturated yet, and so the value can only increase (unless mass amounts of people magically decide to dump everything) via adoption.

I don’t think you understand what *value* is. Belief has nothing to do with ‘value.’ The value comes from the fact that bartering is inconvenient and so people make use of something that is convenient as a stand-in for any and all goods and services.
As should be obvious, currencies, even these 0’s and 1’s, had a massive practical utility and are therefore highly valuable. 
I know this is supposed to be a ‘devil’s advocate’ approach, but this is a rather ridiculous point. 
Lastly, the ‘belief,’ as you call it, will not fail at any moment. Are people suddenly going to declare that a common currency of exchange suddenly isn’t ‘useful’ because it isn’t a massive inconvenience? Makes little to no sense.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:18:09

Those ‘ups and downs’ are statistical variations. Bitcoin has been doing it this entire year. No shit it doesn’t go up in a straight line. 
Bitcoin had one ‘crash,’ so to say “bitcoin’s entire price history has been based around similar-looking bubbles” is beyond absurd. 
The only thing that it has consistently done is rise in price. This happens because more and more people adopt it. This isn’t all that complicated, but you instead want to look at a graph, devoid of all context, and pretend to make valid predictions. This analysis only works within the context of stocks or already saturated currencies. To apply the same graphical analysis to Bitcoin is, again, absurd. 
As an analogy, think of Apple stock before it blew up. If one were to wait, like you claim, at a seemingly high, yet infantile price, they would be waiting forever while Apple stock blows up in value.

What is the carbon footprint of other currencies that are manufactured into physical bills and coins? Bitcoin has a lower CO2 output than does Brazil’s currency CO2 output. 
The offset of value being dumped into bitcoin can have a net decrease in CO2 output. But people are too narrow minded to consider this and make stupid claims like “bitcoin mining is contributing to destroying the environment.”
Anyone that actually believes bitcoin mining is destroying the environment is a moron. It is like saying scraping a layer of skin off is killing you.

It’s not a bubble. Bitcoin was 0.25% of the world’s currency. A mere linear adoption rate is enough to sustain exponential growth.
