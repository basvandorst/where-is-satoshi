Panic selling will crash the sites and triple the panic. Timing the market will not work though. You may sell at 3k but it will rise to 5k and only drop to 3.5k later. I sold too early hoping to buy back and now my buyback orders are half of current price ... not impossible but unlikely. But I only sold a piece, never more than 5% in one trade and I will sell more on the way up, likely around 3k.
So hodl or trade pieces ... dont put all coins in one order and do not panic if the storm hits.

I think its a bot trying to manipulate the price down, the wall is moving both ways quite fast.

Its removed, price jumped up.
But this brings me to idea: is anyone tracking changes in order books for later viewing and possible analysis? I am thinking of a service where you could look at order book of 10min ago and maybe replay its dynamics last 24h with preset speed.

Awesome stuff. How about zooming? How about labeling tx-s? Like a public comments box for a tx and/or a private visual client-side label to identify bubbles when you are working through a chain of related Bitcoin movements.

I like this approach more, but would love to see a combo:
* web service for both timestamping and verification
* client-side hashing
* pay to address for putting your files state into chain ala Bitstamper (no bloating of blockchain)
* open-source (if the service goes down, its trivial to set it up somewhere else for verifications to continue)
