Worth a shot, maybe I can finally try out this tipping thing :)

'Average' dev here... For 4 salaried devs who are in your own company, 100k / month is too high, 50k is more realistic, and would be on the high end. (150k annual salary for each dev)
For startups, even lower is common and its balanced with stock options. 
Anyways, these are what's the 'higher' end for average/ok devs.
But for contractors, 100k is actually realistic with an hourly rate of $150 if they work 40 hours a week. 
There is also the legends of the 10x engineer... he is worth 10 normal engineers. Companies give these guys anything to keep them happy and productive. I heard a story of a 10x engineer that [redacted] before his interview, went in high and threw [redacted] through a window. Later he asked how many days he was expected to come in and said it was too much, and he still got an offer. 
I don't know, man.
The type of software (a forum, in this case) is a non-issue, the industry rate is just what it is. Just like when you hire a lawyer by the hour, they charge the same rate for whatever they do, even if it's writing a simple letter. 
You can hire a shitty lawyer, or you hire a great one. It depends on what you want.
It seems like this forum is open-source. I believe the internet and digital communication media still have much room to grow, if this guy thinks along those lines maybe what they are making will be invaluable. 
Don't be dissuaded Thermos. If you believe in it, that's all that matters. I see its all open source on github. That's great~

Sorry about the theft. 
2FA's weakest point is phone numbers. If the attacker knows your number, they may be able to hijack your voicemail or texts and get past 2FA. 
The most secure 2FA is to disable voice/phone related things, because you know... telecoms are weak, and such. Only use the authentication app.
