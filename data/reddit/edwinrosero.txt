Thanks to for the great artwork.
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:22:07
Yes only 100 uniques exist on the blockchain

This is a huge deal for anyone that is creating digital content of any sort. I'm really blown away by what they've put together thus far.  
Ascribe is the service I used during my live auction here on @_date: 2015-06-14 01:40:38
If you take a picture of the Mona Lisa you have a copy. You can print it and enjoy it but you do not own the Mona Lisa. You cannot sell your copy for millions because it is a worthless copy. 
Same idea. If I transfer ownership to you there will be a record of transfer on the blockchain as well as a record of the original artwork being Ascribed on the blockchain. Only you can sell the Edition you bought (to a reputable art gallery) since you posses ownership- regardless of how many copies exist out in the world.

I'm the Artist that had the world's first live art auction here on the Bitcoin subreddit and i'm stoked to see Ascribe.io getting the recognition they deserve. 
If any of you are interested in checking out some of art:  
@_date: 2015-06-15 03:19:20
The value comes from the a) Proof of the Artist transferring ownership. b) Scarcity of the item - Supply/Demand is obviously in effect. An artist has an incentive to limit the number of ascribed editions. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 20:13:36
Check the SPOOL area of the work
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:53:10
The way you differentiate between them is that I can prove ownership on the blockchain and you cannot. This is why Ascribe exists. Each of the Ascribed editions are provably unique. If you have a better method for guaranteeing the scarcity of a digital artwork i'd be interesting in hearing about it.  
@_date: 2015-06-14 01:41:43
Precisely. You get it.
@_date: 2015-06-27 02:35:55
Wences for world president. Jesus what a badass!!!
@_date: 2015-06-15 03:23:19
The future is going to have to work with the aforementioned method. See, the problem of exact replication - or duplication- exists in digital files today. However, in a future where atomically precise 3d printing exists, we will need a way of differentiating between atomically identical objects. The solution is A) generating a  Proof of Existence  and B) Generating a chain of ownership. If you can think of a better way i'd love to hear it. 
BTW You can read more on the SPOOL protocol layer created by Ascribe here: 
@_date: 2015-06-15 20:03:37
It can also make digital objects into hard assets. For example: Digital Artwork!

Apparently I won. Not sure if you were being serious about the $50 - I'm happy with the $200. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:37:21
Hey everyone. Edwin here. Bitcoin is truly mind blowing. Thank you to the community and to Jeff for the opportunity to help out. Jeff is a gentleman and a scholar, thanks again for the $200 bounty. Proof it's me:

Picasso was no Vermeer. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:42:57
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:13:36
Hello! And thanks for reaching out. I'll PM you my details. Do you know if this is for a personal collection or if it's to be re-sold via a gallery of some sort? 
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:31:55
Nothing to add besides 11 being a special number to me too!
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:02:14
Yeah, I heard the same podcast. It's a wild idea for sure - I'm not sure how I feel about it. I see a lot of good could come from something like that. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:22:39
PM me the email address you'd like to use. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:05:39
You can claim it's an original and other's could believe it. You would be immoral, they would be wrong. Neither of you would have an original. 
Your hashes are on different block than mine.
I have the layered file, you dont. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:04:30
Thank you. I could add it to the image and send you it - however the edition that is hashed to the blockchain does not have it. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:44:51
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:24:29
The originals exist on the blockchain and can have their hash verified. A copy has no such association. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:08:28
Any love for the Bitcoin Song? 
@_date: 2015-05-16 17:52:59
Check out Ascribe.io - That's the service I am using. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:40:49
Hello there!
The process is very simple. PM me the email address you'd like to receive the artwork and certificate to. Send 0.1 btc via changetip or to  and You'll receive the artwork once the transaction hits the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:53:33
My GF is the same way. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:50:19
Awesome thanks.
The ownership is done on the Blockchain via the service Ascribe.io The way it works is via their platform- I'm not affiliated with them in any way. I'm just a nerd artist that has been wanting to do this for a very long time!! Thank you for the contribution and for being one of the first anonymous persons to ever purchase one of my pieces. It means a lot to me!
In order to transfer the ownership I need to tell Ascribe who to transfer it to. I'll need an e-mail address you'd like to use so you can receive the certificate of ownership. You will have edition 2/100 - it has a unique URL and anytime you visit the Link your email address will show up as the being the current owner of that edition - it should also enable a download link for the high-res artwork. You can then resell or transfer the artwork to anyone you want. I will no longer have any control. Hope that makes sense!
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:20:07
Nope. You're the 5th! 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:24:22
Done! Thank you so much Trent. I'm a HUGE fan of Ascribe.io and would love to help you guys out in any capacity that I can. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:37:39
This Picasso painting sold for over one hundred million bucks: 
even though countless copies have been made. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:01:27
My copies are not copies. They are unique/originals. A copy is just a copy. I know it's weird thinking about this stuff when it's a digital file. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:57:58
So far 7 people have exchanged bits for the artwork. There is some perceived value. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:54:25
Ok will do. Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:55:50
I sent it. You should get an e-mail about it. There is a password associated with the file: welcomehome
you probably don't need it. Ascribe wouldnt let me send you the ownership without it. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:46:54

@_date: 2015-05-13 17:35:29
screenshot? thats for nubs. You could have just right clicked and saved the high res file but you still dont own it :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:47:33
Any serious Art Collectors interested? perhaps? 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:53:26
Because your copy doesn't have a certificate of authenticity nor the chain of ownership showing I granted you ownership. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 15:41:39
That's what happened. Each of the 100 editions has a unique hash on the blockchain, therefore each edition is unique. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:00:29
Yes! Although the minimum donation has gone up to $5
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:48:24
Ok thanks! 
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:40:40
I also accept payment via  
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:37:52
Not seeing anything show up. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:52:14
Thanks for clarifying that up! 
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:41:34
Thank you for the kind words! I love Bitcoin. You may also like this thread with some artwork I made. The cover of this Bitcoin song will also go on sale one day:

Hi the offer for "any amount of money for a print" ended about two hours ago when the 5th edition was sold. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:53:55
Ascribe.io hashes the email address you provided along with the file. Thus, only you can transfer the file via Ascribe.io to someone else. If you lose the file you can re-download it from Ascribe.io 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:13:48
Haha seems like you do! PM me the email address you'd like the ownership to travel to
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:46:01
I can prove that i'm the original creator because I have the original source files. I suppose at the moment you have to trust that I am the original creator. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:41:31
Just login into ascribe.io and issue something yourself to see how it works. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:37:11
We're already doing things on Reddit that have never been done before. For example, the first digital painting whose ownership is ensured by the blockchain, sold to Redditors on this thread:  
@_date: 2015-05-14 06:48:25
Is anyone brave enough to offer 1btc?
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:38:17
Yeo you beat me to it.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:22:44
If you'd like to be part of history and be one of the first to own a cubist digital painting whose ownership is enforced via the blockchain now is your chance. First 5 people to changetip me some bits can own a copy. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:58:23
That sounds like a good idea. However, I am more artist than cryptogrpher...I'll contact the Ascribe people and ask them about such a scheme. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 23:11:16
Normal people dont make enough to invest in anything. They also lack the education from their parents to invest, they are also depressed, obese and their attention to important matters are attacked every second by television and other forms of entertainment. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:55:26
Awesome 
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:16:32
No. Can you explain what it is? 
@_date: 2015-09-30 19:41:00
This isn't about copying the image. It's about proof of authenticity. Read more about it on the Ascribe.io website.

The nature of Bitcoin as a distributed and decentralized network coming to consensus is visualized by the collection of these historic physical coins coming together to form the Bitcoin Logo. Each physical coin can be interpreted as a node in the network. 
Bitcoins are also fundamentally immaterial. This immaterial feature is what endows bitcoin the magical properties of global, near instantaneous transfer without a third party, as well as a programatic divisibility that is impractical of material coins of the past.

Hey guys! My Bitcoin artwork and Archeometry artworks are featured in this video! If anyone wants a version (either digital on the blockchain or physical just PM me)

I spent 2 weeks on and off (I have a full-time 9-5 job) on this piece. Probably around 30-40 hours of work. I've been written about before and my work has been called "Historic" due to this piece that I auctioned off on Reddit. see: 
There is decent odds that my work might be a collectible in the future but nothing is guaranteed. For the first edition of this piece I think 0.5 BTC price is fair. What do you think?
