Been looking for ways to do that given default rate trends

Default rate is extremely high. You can never rid of loans in bankruptcy. But large numbers of people are not able to make minimum payments

Default means they're not in good standing for payments. 
31% late on payments

It really is a forever debt. 
Lifetime loss of wealth
Most people don't realize just how much it costs them. And that's even if it yields a positive return financially. 1/4 of colleges have permanent negative roi.

They're taking quite few SS checks now as it is. Won't know about today's grads for a long time. Not to mention all the looming tax bombs

Can we all come together and retire the use of that god forsaken overused word

Yeah, I called 50k by the first.
