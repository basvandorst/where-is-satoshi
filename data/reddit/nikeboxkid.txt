It will clear.. I did that once and it took like 6-7 days but confirmed in the end
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:52:49
Coinbase or Poloniex, check those out mate 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:54:57
Yeah, it sounds like it is fine then... Maybe just got crushed and split the glue seem on side... Good luck, it's pretty awesome so far!

Was it sealed in a plastic wrap? Before getting to the tamper stickers it should have been unwrapped from plastic (like DVD when covered with plastic wrap)

This has been said since $5 BTC... Then there was Jaime and now Buffet -- haters gonna hate

MyCelium is great wallet... You can customize the fees which are ABSURD lately... You'd still need to send back into coinbase or another exchange to sell though

Lol , it's funny how people believe fiat has intrinsic value just cause backed by their old faithful govt ... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:07:55
Haha get em bull... cause the Chinese govt and snakes in suits have OUR best interest , right......

Appreciate all the help - you guys rock !!! 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:52:26
Lots of inflated egos and numbers on here... That is a great starting point and just continue to build your position... and the HODL on tight

A calculator ... For a future anticipated price: take the amount of BTC you have and multiply by the BTC price.
If you think BTC will be  $5k then do 0.10BTC * 5000 = $500

This seems to be a coordinated attack on BTC - the fearful ones at top ... Snakes in suits and governments - the most trustworthy folks 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:31:37
Too many Nostradamus impersonators ;) 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:08:19
Coinbase is legit just their customer service is basically non existent.  They'll fix the problem -- just may take awhile... Legit company though

Big suits becoming fearful... spending lots of time trying to tarnish the threat:

Put it this way; Jamie dimon wouldn't be wasting his time talking about it if didn't think it's a BIG DEAL ... 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:28:00
Jamie Dimon on Reddit now?? ��
You can't keep it down , stop trying 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:33:04
coinmama and aVPN
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:35:22
That Jamie Dimon trait ...

China and regulation go together like the white on their rice 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:33:05
Coinmama was legit , used awhile ago though 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:36:18
The transaction fees you pay go to miners, in addition to the existing block reward... Tx fees, read up ;)
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:41:04
BTC is back over $4k so they can't talk about it "crashing" ��... Hahaha MSM and their hate for BTC 
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:01:02
With coinbase you don't technically own the coins since don't have the private key... it's working off an IOU with coiinbase and trusting they'll transmit your requests.. I'm sure they have regulations but in theory , yes totally possible! 
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:08:23
Awesome -- that is what I thought ... Appreciate the help!!

Try cex.io - they're legit... As is coinbase!

Mycelium is good on Android - check if on iOS 
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:13:23
Don't invest with the "get rich" mindset and you'll be fine... Exciting time for Bitcoin !!!
