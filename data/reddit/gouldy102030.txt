it's a cost issue. as the cost of running a node to verify security then the value of the network diminishes - because it costs more to verify security.
edit 1:  it's a cost issue.  as the cost of running a node to verify security increases, all else constant, then the value of the network diminishes - because it costs more to verify security.

Because there is no mechanism to pay nodes we will have less nodes than we would under a purely market system.   The market is the most efficient system for allocating resources (that we know of) and in the absence of a market we would expect other incentives to kick in - like users running nodes because they are afraid.  
But don't be fooled into thinking this is a market that clears supply and demand - it can not be since there is no method for users to pay nodes  - so in a sense built into the bitcoin protocol is an unfair advantage to miners at the expense of nodes.  
Good news is we're not a breaking point yet - at least using empirical evidence since the network is still running.  But as the cost of running nodes increases (blocks continue to increase in size without offsets in hardware price declines) this debate will resurface.
If you're into economics, this is a classic third party payer market:

I like this because it is a modest increase in block size for immediate concerns and will allow the technology to catch up for handling more and more transactions.  I think this plan is a good bridge to better implementations in the future and would love to see if happy.  Question is, does China like it?

No!  DO NOT STORE BITCOINS WITH A 3RD PARTY!  The ferret is a third party.  Given infinite time, eventually he will fractional reserve and then lose all your money.

Just did this.  Very easy, it felt like the future.  Was able to just donate $0.25 without problem and got straight through to site.  Felt like the future - except maybe in the future the payment address will include the miners fee?  Seems like a little much for ordinary users to figure out on something quick like a news article.

I don't think this is comparable, and it could be seen as offensive.

The only way to do this and not open up another door for an attack is to make it 51%.  Since there is already a 51% attack vector on the network, this would lead to no change in security.  Seem slike a no brainer.

Do nodes get to vote on the block size debate?  Or does it even matter, because the only vote that counts is what software the miners are running?  
@_date: 2015-07-26 03:47:28
But if payment is sent directly to the driver?  Then they are no longer processing the transactions.  If you built on top of a decentralized marketplace then Uber would be just software, right?

if we don't see upwards price pressure from the halving what do you think that will do to market psychology?
@_date: 2015-10-25 19:06:37
This is actually incorrect.  What you are seeing in bitcoin is the money supply - not actual inflation.  Money supply in a lot of countries is already above 5% this year, including the US, which is currently at around 4% increase on the year and is likely to cross 5 before year end.
tl;dr -&gt; money supply does not equal inflation.

Only by crowdsourcing (and open sourcing) will we be able to keep up with the rapid changes brought on by bitcoin.  Also it prevents the "trusted 3rd party" problem.  Finally there are tons of quirks in the current global payment system that will likely be more quickly addressed by dedicated users of open source software than large corporations.
Just ask yourself:  are you happy with the current pace of bitcoin brick and mortar merchant adoption?
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:06:01

There are more private keys than atoms in the known universe.  The only effective method to get them now is to guess.  You would not have enough ATOMS IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE to guess.
I'm not kidding.
'10^90+ private keys

A US based bitcoin exchange.  It would explode.  If they are truly a large bank they have US presence already.
Does anyone else find it weird that there isn't an exchange in NYC already?

Governments will probably still require payment of taxes in their currency - if for no other reason than to prop the value of their particular currency.  If they do this then there will be no added transparency - b/c all their transactions will still be in fiat.

also working on creating a "backbone" of larger bitcoin mining networks to more efficiently handle this issue.  Lots of talk in this area.  
simple solution is just lift the limit which can be done right now.  they are looking for an elegant solution to prevent other potential issues.  if anything we should encourage them to continue on this path.

Yeah!  Glad I'm not the only one who thinks moving straight to satoshi is not entirely crazy.

Need better POS systems for merchants :).
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:24:05
Coinbase has very easy merchant tools.  I would check their system out.  Also Bitpay is releasing updates to their services as well.
Noticed you were in NY.  You could also post a help wanted in the Bitcoin (jobs4bitcoin) section and find a local enthusiast / IT guy to set you up.  Lots of people would want to help.  Maybe for a few coffee's and a photo of the setup when it's finished :).
The issues with integrating with your POS are not currently fully solved, there is no open source POS system right now, and by far the easiest is just a simple wallet.

I think its mostly an education issue.  Wikipedia is a very conservative traditional non profit these days.  Would be great if one of the payment processors reached out to educate them and possibly even offer to set them up pro bono.  Bitcoin is so good for freedom of information and thought that wikipedia will eventually "get it".  I know you are frustrated - patience.  I've been working on my local bar for a year now.  And as soon as they start accepting bitcoin it will have all been worth it.

If anyone out there is currently working on something like this and you live in SF, PM me.  I've already started on this idea and am working with a local merchant who has an in house POS based on Linux - so that would be a great start.  Figured I'd make a call out to the Bitcoin Community first.  The community has grown so fast - there's probably someone working on this and I'd love to help.
