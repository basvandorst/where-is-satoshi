Not to that degree. I have 3 BTC's. ;(
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:26:55
People get killed for shit like this. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:41:24
It's a sad story. I bought 2500 at $10 it dropped to $7 in a day and I got spooked. I sold them all when I earned my money back. 
I was too cautious. Now I feel I'm too late. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:34:31
Someone buy this man some gold
@_date: 2014-03-29 14:19:03
I bought 500 BTC's $10 and crashed to $7 with in an hour. I was so spooked I sold as soon as it hit $12. I've been kicking myself in the ass ever since. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:39:53
I bought 500 BTC at $10 and sold at $12. I've been kicking myself in the ass for the last year. Kinda feel lucky now. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:08:39
This is the beginning 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:22:01
The dumbest thing I ever did was sell my bitcoins. I bought 500 for $10 each but I got spooked by a 30% dip and dumped them. Though I probably would have lost them in the mtgox hack. 
@_date: 2012-08-08 05:12:19
I never said that. 
@_date: 2012-08-15 17:05:32
Classic isn't working either.
@_date: 2012-08-05 07:25:40
How's anonymity for intrinsic value?
@_date: 2012-09-05 21:40:12
Nope.  Turns out it is a Order Cancelation &amp; Login lagging error.
"Hello Mt.Gox Users,
 
We are running a database query at the moment and this could affect some users resulting in trade order cancellation lagging and the login button not working when trying to access the account.  We expect the database query to complete soon and will update you once this process is done.  Our apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Seems to have been a browser issue. Restarted my machine and everything is fine. Thanks for the input guys!
@_date: 2012-01-16 23:49:42
What was BTCinch?
@_date: 2012-08-08 05:04:29
That sucks!
@_date: 2012-08-15 20:58:43
weird. thanks!
@_date: 2012-08-08 05:10:56
Why is it I'll advised to use mtgox as a wallet. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:36:07
Way ahead of you. I'm not looking to gouge my landlord but if I could make a cool $6 million over the next year that would be great.
@_date: 2012-08-05 06:52:38
Yeah right...  Ever done business with them?
@_date: 2016-09-06 12:41:08
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:34:37
That kid is gonna be a billionaire someday 
@_date: 2011-11-06 17:40:24
Never gonna happen. There isn't enough money in it. Bitcoins trade at around .055% CC's charge 1.75%-3.5%. 
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:30:48
So it's not instantaneous then?
@_date: 2011-12-10 15:04:37
How about making them look like a respectable currency and not Asian candy?
@_date: 2011-06-22 20:33:14
Lack of users.
@_date: 2011-06-22 20:31:23
Lack of users.
@_date: 2011-11-07 02:07:23
Where exactly are you getting these numbers?  
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:31:46
ok?  What will that tell me?
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:26:18
So it's not instantaneous then?
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:31:22
I initiated a transfer

If you want your message heard repeat in Chinese. 
@_date: 2011-06-22 06:51:01
You are clearly an idiot who doesn't understand math, finance or history. Those models and equations are built on centuries old currencies and a massive wealth of precedent.  You are not only stupid but entirely misguided in attempting to apply them in this way. 
If you have any BTCs you like to sell let me know. I'll happily give you $0.01 for them. 
@_date: 2011-06-29 02:14:03
I'm diggin it brotha. Let me know when you have something setup for retail and service based businesses. I'd love to take a bite out of visa an mastercard's asses. 
Also what is your average processing time at the moment. It seems to me to be one of the biggest hurdles for BTCs going mainstream. 
One other thing, can you tell us about security?
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:25:29
smart ass!
@_date: 2011-06-25 20:34:43
how do I know what the current number of blocks is?
@_date: 2011-06-22 06:39:53
Yeah that could have been 10 minutes shorter. 
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:54:23
Wow! I have a lot to learn.  Thanks for helping a noob!
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:24:33
I initiated a transfer
@_date: 2011-11-06 20:00:16
Then what's the point beyond novelty?
@_date: 2011-07-13 02:38:14
It'll take forces a ton greater than Ron Paul could ever bring to make that happen.  RP loves throwing ideas around but they never seem to go anywhere. 
@_date: 2011-06-25 19:53:34
Bingo!  I didn't know you had to reach 133254.  Thanks for helping a noob!
@_date: 2011-06-25 23:26:02
good point
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:30:41
Can someone explain this to a noob?
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:35:33
Yeah well I bought 500 at $10 and sold them at $15. I thought it was the smart move. ಠ_ಠ
@_date: 2013-01-16 08:52:36
Congratulations!  You are on the grid!
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:21:02
The song of the over confident. Be careful. These are dangerous grounds. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:58:37
Got it. Thanks!
