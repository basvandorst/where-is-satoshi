Been through and avoided tech crash and GFC. I think there may be some average corrections in the future but I'm confident that what we are seeing is the global, mass adoption of Bitcoin in an exponential viral fashion. Sure, there's a fair amount of USA institutional money as well but that's not necessarily bad. Given that wall street rarely moves in the direction the majority predicts I think the futures will drive up the price of BTC even more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:59:22
Ladder out of your position slowly until you have your principal investment back and you still have some bitcoin. At that point, whatever happens, happens. If it goes to 50k then that's risk-free money. If it drops to $1 then you had a fun ride and didn't lose anything.

Bitcoin can be both but not at the the same time.
While it finds its value in *the present* it will be a store of wealth and your "stake" in the new currency.
When it finds it's value in *the future* it will then be used for purchases.

@_date: 2017-12-11 06:58:04
No worries. I just try to go with whatever makes sense. Funny, I'd gotten a text from a kinda mental friend saying something along the lines of "There's gonna be a doomsday event and the banks are going to take everyone's money!!!". He was an Alex Jones head, whatever. I asked someone in a forum that I knew had a lot of experience in the markets and was a straight up rational thinker. He explained why he had sold his house and was just waiting for the housing market to collapse. I looked into what he said, the evidence seemed solid so I decided to pull everything out just in case. I figured it would hurt worse to go through a crash than lose out on a years worth of gains. So glad I did. Unfortunately, the guy that tipped me off to the GFC started advising to take out shorts on the S&amp;P because "this time is not different" and as usual, the market would climb back but the money printed would drag the market back down. Thankfully I didn't follow him too far down that road. The dude incurred heavy losses believing "this time is no different".

I follow a more contrarian view. The better bet is to predict that wall street will move opposite to prevailing sentiment. With BUBBLE!!! and HERE COME THE SHORTS! as prevailing sentiment, I expect wall street will go long and reap the rewards. Maybe they'll turn to shorts after it hits 100k.

So you don't know how to use google. You just parrot statistics handed to you. Got it.


When the arguments are parroted statistics that are easily de-bunked I tend to not only switch off but take a less trusting view of the entire movement behind it. End of the day, enviro-warriors appear to be self-hating, mostly wealthy, white people that want to see an end to the first world and the wealth that their parents/grandparents worked so hard to attain for them.
At this point, my interactions with countless enviro-liars have brought me to the point that I don't care if we have to strangle baby sea turtles to power bitcoin.

Don't know about "improving" but it sure is a nice addition. My partner and I have been in for awhile now and Bitcoin is a bit of new source of excitement. Something to talk about, get excited when it rises and commiserate when it drops.

Right now its a store of wealth, as adoption reaches peak and price stabilizes over the coming year/months the speed and efficiency will increase making it usable as a currency. 
Until then it's fine to be used as a source of wealth generation for those looking to do so. Bitcoin will still be there long after they've moved on.

@_date: 2017-12-05 08:24:50
1. Bitcoin is only like shares in that it can increase and decrease in value according to demand.
2. You can buy bitcoin on exchanges in Australia. I use Independent Reserve. It's very easy.
3. You can "invest" by buying Bitcoin (see above). Start slow, be patient, hold your stake, don't panic when prices fall (they'll rise again, they ALWAYS do) and don't think you can time/play the market without spending a few months studying the psychological tricks you'll need to have at your disposal to do such a thing. Best bet is to not play the market at all and hold steady.
3. You haven't missed the boom. We are in early-mid adoption phase.

Why not buy a long position on bitcoin futures. Honestly, I think that's going to be the winning bet given that the overriding sentiment is "they're going to crash bitcoin!!". Wall Street rarely does what everyone thinks it will. It's how they make money.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:49


I was pretty neutral on the subject until it became clear that Bcash was relying on brand confusion to market their coin. It's not so much that it's underhanded but more that it's a terrible marketing strategy.

Compelling analysis. We are absolutely in a different era right now. How different though is still being realized.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:43:11
Have a look at currency values (USD to all others) after the GFC to get an idea of what will happen when bitcoin is there in the same scenario. Example, USD to AUD before GFC was almost 1 USD = .90 AUD. After GFC? 1 USD = .50 AUD.
Basically, when people sell their stocks, the first place that money goes is into the bank/cash. Now, Bitcoin is an attractive alternative to cash.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:47:27
I would add that while I really liked it, I also thought it was maybe too unrecognizable. What would happen if the gaps were tighter?

@_date: 2017-12-20 07:14:52

You might want to have a trusted relative handle the cellphone identity checks for your sign-up. If you are simultaneously connected to them via skype or facebook while signing up, they can just tell you what the codes are. Once you are signed up you can disable that feature and use google authenticator. I haven't received a cell code since signup on Independent Reserve.

True for some, however, there may very well be a fair amount of experienced, traditional stock investors in that mix as well.

I'm about as suspicious and cautious of bubbles as anyone (pulled out of all mutual funds 6 months before GFC) but I honestly think Bitcoin has much, MUCH more hype, adoption and growth ahead. 
I don't have a set number for pulling out so much as a sense of oversaturation. I believe the coming futures are going to accelerate that sense as they drive BTC to the moon.

You could simply put that 8k in now, wait for the run to 10k (assuming that happens) but place an order to sell if it dips too far below your buying price. That way you are already in if it keeps going but you are out if it gets to uncomfortable for that amount of money from your portfolio.

If you believe that it's a no-brainer that money would end up being expressed digitally then by all means, buy and HODL.

Depends on what price you bought it. Buy low sell high. Simple.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:19:45
Not too late. We are most likely in the early-mid adoption phase.
How much? Only as much as you can afford to lose.

Hah. You were worried until Sydney RE flatlined and Bitcoin bolted. 'on ya!
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:54:45


So you buy high and sell low? OK.


You should have a closer look at bitcoin history before devising a sell strategy.

This is what a spike in adoption looks like.

Didn't really blast through 9k to 10k like it did 8-9k TBH.
We saw the "dip" this past few days. It wasn't being expressed in one big dip but tiny dips as people sold off to a large number of buyers.
The batons have been passed from early to mid-stage adopters in tiny increments. Now we pick up where some of our fore-adopters left off.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:27:34
Funny. I've been think of how it might be possible to tie bitcoin to the sex industry. Porn was crucial to VCR over betamax adoption.

If you believe in Bitcoin then a drop is a buy trigger. Best approach is to ladder into the price drops increasing your purchase as it drops.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:44:27
Do you think it's a bit of a no-brainer that money would eventually be expressed digitally? If so, then buy and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:11:36
LOL. Of course huffpo would have to make it about class, race and sex. The contributors livelihood, as meager as it is, is built on playing to its market's desire for racism, sexism, and classism. With the actual supply of those elements being at an all-time low, they have to manufacture them to fill the demand. There's satan under every rock and in every slice of toast.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:57:00
One thing I learned from the GFC crash is that when the market tanks, people liquidate assets into cash which makes the US dollar stronger against other currencies. For example, [before the crash, AUD was at about .80-.90 USD. After the crash the AUD was only worth about .50 USD.](
Now we have Bitcoin. It's entirely possible that if/when the market collapses, people will pile their assets into Bitcoin &amp; cash. We'll see....
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:44:55


Yes. The pattern is, HODL'ers typically have better returns than people who believe they know how to time the market.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:53:54
The exchanges will be storing your currency and bitcoin until you move your bitcoin to a wallet. Their security depends only on how secure and insured they are.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:13:02
There's the possibility of movement in both directions.
I'd think if there were a plan to short BTC then they'd want to build it up first.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:20:44
A more precise version of the term "dip".
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:46:48
In the GFC people liquidated their assets and moved into cash. The USD value to other currencies skyrocketed (1 USD=.50 AUD for example).
Given that, I think it's very safe to assume another big correction would absolutely see a fair amount of assets liquidated into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:49:48
If you are thinking of this as a mid to long-term investment then now is a good time to buy and HODL.
There will always be dips but the overall trajectory is up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:34:03
lol. Price went up $300 during a phone conversation about the run-up. Incredible adoption is happening right now.

Yep. We are in a new era where the internet, social media and global application combine to create enormous run-ups that in some cases, never seem to stop.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:47
Yep. People have been asking this and from my experience with the GFC of 2008, when the market goes down people sell their assets and put that cash into banks. I watched the USD to AUD go from 1USD = .90 AUD to 1 USD = *.50 AUD.* in days.
If it happens again, you can be sure people will be diverting those liquidated assets into Bitcoin.

Here's how it's going to go down.
Mass adoption happens because of price hype. Price rises. Adopters are happy with letting their investment rise and HODL. Meanwhile, technology and innovation evolve behind the scenes to pave the way for easier, cheaper purchases and security. One day everyone wakes up, bitcoin is fully functional and early, mid and late adopters now have the option to buy homes, cars, sweaters and bicycles.

Another thought on the bubble topic. Funny how none of the experts, save for a rare few, had any idea that the real estate bubble was about to collapse in 2008. If they couldn't see that (I did, along with a few others and we weren't even "experts") then why should we trust them to know how large bitcoin is supposed to be?

I'm doing both. Investment and mid-large purchases. The investment dividends pay for the purchases. Life is good.
I assume as purchasing becomes easier and less expensive, I'll be spending more of my Bitcoin profits.

I honestly am not getting many indicators that any majority really care about functionality right now. The normies are piling in and they don't follow reddit crypto wars or crypto bloggers, they only want what everyone is talking about, BitCOIN. 
Bcash could very well end up being the Betamax of crypto (better tech, no foothold or adoption-&gt;loser). Time will tell.

I think all those profit takers were taking profits during the days that it took to break through from 9 to 10k. That's over now and the thanksgiving early/mid-term adopters are continuing to jump on the train now that they have money in their accounts.

They're known as early or mid-term adopters (depending on future outcome).

I don't think president Trump has had much influence on Bitcoins rise. The foundations and trajectory were laid well before his arrival.
The best he can do is simply let Bitcoin continue to create wealth for Americans. I believe this hands-off approach dovetails nicely with his MAGA mindset/slogan.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:19:29


Yep. People are making money. When people make money, government sees tax revenue and peripheral gains through growth, venture capital, startups etc. There is a strong incentive for the US gov. to help Americans make money. I'd say the current administration has even more incentive to follow through on their promise to "Make America Great Again".

I don't know. Business failure rates are really high.
I believe we are in a new era where the old entrepreneurship ideals don't pay off as handsomely as they used to. There are some who believe the best investments now are to simply follow whatever the high IQ people are doing. Bitcoin is in that realm.

Or put half in now and wait and see if there is a major correction to buy more.
I slowly laddered in but in hindsight, I wish I'd just put it all in in one go.

If you bought to HODL then think of this as your first real test.
Next time maybe ladder into your purchases. I put a little in at about the same time you did and have been buying more as it drops. The bigger the drop, the bigger the order.

Getting in isn't really tied to time intervals so much as price.
If you are 100% sure about getting invested in Bitcoin then just get in now and HODL.
If you aren't too sure then buy a little now and hope to find dips to buy into in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:26:12
These are traditional signs to sell. OTOH, Bitcoin might just be "different this time".

I think we are seeing the "dip" right now. It's not being expressed in one big dip but tiny dips as people sell to a large number of buyers.
The batons are being passed from early to mid-stage adopters in tiny increments.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:16:38
Fair enough. As another poster said, it's not really your place to pester her about her money so unless that forward-thinking FA comes forward you might just want to drop it and do your own thing.

I stopped watching about 5 episodes in when he spouted the "OMG! Half of all federal prisoners are in for drug charges!!!" line that seemed so popular last year.
Fact is, federal prisons only make up about 7% of the total prison population. The rest are in state prisons and the majority of those people are in for violent/predatory convictions *as they should be*.

Ya gotta wonder how many of those sells are break-even "oh my god I'm so glad I got my money back!" sells. I have a hunch there's going to be quite a few of those from this point up to 20k. They'll probably buy back in from 20k  on up. lol.

I've noticed that r/bitcoin sentiment closely follows Bitcoin direction. If it's going up, most posts are positive. If it's going down, most posts are negative. This makes r/bitcoin a terrible place to seek any useful advice.
