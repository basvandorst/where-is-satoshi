Not funny but true.

Install miner on their PC. /s

So bitcoin solves the problem of zero fees with its ridiculous fees and that Lighting bullshit? Great!
@_date: 2019-11-20 12:35:39
Of course 
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:54:19
Yeah, it's stable as...dollar!!!
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:52:22
You probably don't know a shit about Keynes, do you?
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:52:15
If you just keep buying, how are paying for stuff? With fiat?
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:03:25
Only if the fees are lower than the price, which isn't the case usually.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:11:53
With the absurdly high fees it's not such surprise.
@_date: 2019-12-12 13:53:23
Dog shit is very useful for leather makers. Bitcoin, not so much.
@_date: 2019-12-30 07:38:39
Yes and hashes can be computed by pen and paper. You really seem to understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:22:57
"a bit"
@_date: 2019-04-18 01:08:02
That's the actual point.
@_date: 2019-04-21 20:34:08
For people with monthly income to cover one transaction fee? Certainly.
@_date: 2019-04-17 17:37:29
Say "Bye-bye" to overdraft &amp; withdrawal fees, say hello to absurdly high fees on every transaction.
@_date: 2019-04-18 06:01:13
It is, but what can you do about it?
@_date: 2019-04-18 01:08:21
No, Lightning is late.
@_date: 2019-04-18 01:00:16
Yes, you probably are.
@_date: 2019-04-09 08:37:59
I would love to use Bitcoin to buy stuff, but the fees are ridiculously high and it's slow as molasses. Debit card is much faster and cheaper.
@_date: 2019-04-18 01:07:16
Lightning network is like a bank account that is terrible to use and nobody accepts it anyway.
@_date: 2019-04-20 16:58:55
Obviously. You know nothing, truthvigilante. And if you think that $4 is acceptable, then I'm not going to waste my time with you.
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:07:29
What legitimate market are you actually talking about?
@_date: 2019-04-21 20:35:34
You can't be serious. With 3,5$ monthly income, how many BTC transactions can they afford? Three?
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:25:05
Yup, leave the market to fraudsters. They don't contribute too, but...&lt;insert some libertianistic nonsense here&gt;.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:31:12
Lightning and logic in one sequence together?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:30:23
They're promoting Lightning, so you can't expect functional brain.
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:08:04
They could have spent their money on some stupid conference or some other shitty bullshit just to impress their investors. Are they doing it for PR? Of course. Does it help anybody in the process? It hopefully does. It could have been worse.
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:22:04
At least for now is the important detail, but yeah.
@_date: 2011-07-28 15:26:39
People with bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:58:28
What research? It's a twitter post by someone called "WhalePanda" without any links to actual data.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:36:00
Thanks for link.
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:23:14
5 USD will barely cover the fees.
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:05:40
OK.
