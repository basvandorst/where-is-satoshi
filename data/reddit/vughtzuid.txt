@_date: 2019-08-25 19:28:51
Only 0.5 BTC huh? What will you do with it?

For sure, probably max 50% of my BTC holdings and getting rid of a lot of shitcoins when breakeven/slight profit. Learned my lesson in 2018. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 06:44:27
You shorted BTC and are now down 45K?
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:39:32
The ignorance is shocking
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:05:20
No he’s telling you he doesn’t need your overly redundant comment

So the theory is that depending on whether shorts outweigh longs or vice versa when the triangle ‘closes’ it will either pump hard or dump hard, correct?

This. Wow, how can someone write so much cringe into one article? It’s not real right?
If the OP wrote the article I suggest he or she buys as much bitcoin as possible, far higher chance of being successful with that than writing articles.

Haha so much uneducated and non-proof backed claims made by sheeple in this thread
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:34:21

‘Some dude holding BTC crystal balls his holdings to go 100x - 200x at some undefined point in time’

How is this exchange still operational after all the negative PR (or why people still use it for that matter) is truly beyond me
@_date: 2019-04-07 10:37:38

What you are doing wrong: trading on HitBTC
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:38:30
This. Excellent life advice.

Classic case of projection, you are the cousin aren't you OP?
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:30:22
Busted OP!
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:36:51
Please stop posting these 'some person claiming to be an expert says something that might happen' posts. Nobody cares.
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:06:34
Are you not reading the replies? Several people have already explained that by varying the difficulty profitability can be ensured so the problem corrects itself. 
As has also been mentioned already the only hiatus is when everyone decides at the same moment to just not mine anymore, I’m going to go ahead and assume that you can estimate how big the chance is that this will happen.
Any other questions?

Troll account (and not the worst attempt but still too obvious)
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:48:28
Second thing you did wrong: trade BSV
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:56:37
Genuinely laughed out loud, thanks OP

To me this is more an ethical question than legal,  boiling down to the question if you think it is OK to scam the national system (I'm assuming you pay taxes so that's you as well) in order to 'help' a family member.
