Fiat currency is not simply a Government issued currency, it is one like the dollar with no intrinsic value, other than maybe that you can burn it for heat. Bitcoin is technically fiat as well, however you might argue that its utility and relative anonymity (when combined with a VPN) is its intrinsic value. The definition of fiat has been bastardized due to misinformation and lack of research, much like many other words in the "Information Age". "Literally" comes to mind.

BTC is fundamentally the nemesis of "tradition".

The biggest mistake here is the use of the word "right".
These are privileges not rights. Just like driving and marriage.

Their investors would never allow such an unstable commodity to dictate their quarterly estimates. No way.

In order for Bitcoin to go mainstream, it's volume must go up to shift the decimal point at least 2 places to the right, yes, this means 100,000 per BTC, but it also will mean a valid level of volume for it to be used in the world. Currently under $2billion is not going to cut it. So either BTC gets abandoned in 2014 or 2015 or more likely it skyrockets as awareness and adoption increase. I'm betting on the latter. However, what I just said proves the deflationary nature of BTC as it encourages hoarding, but I feel the demand is high enough to offset that fact. But we'll just have to see.
