I do too. I haven't been in love with the new Gmail UI updates. Fastmail has an amazing UI and an awesome feature set around virtual domains, aliases, mail rules, etc.  I also feel better being a paying customer. 
They have even rolled out a decent calendar solution of that is of interest to you.

Seconded. I hear photorec can do it. I've used it before for photos and music and it just might be the best things ever. Good luck!

Indeed.  That wouldn't have helped the image :)

Agreed.  I've heard thermal printers mentioned before for paper wallets and the thought terrifies me.  I think back to all those completely black parking payment receipts on the dash of my car...

Oh well. Hopefully it won't be long with all the interest bitcoin is receiving before some local merchants take bitcoin. I'd love for a service like foodly.

How about using VirtualBox on your Mac and booting a live Linux distro from there. 
Still not perfect but it would require a very specific targeted attack.  I imagine creating malware that inspects a running VM to try and scrape information out of a process is pretty tough.

Congrats. I've used you a handful of times already because it's just so simple and fast. Thanks!

Awesome job.  Thanks for this!

I'm assuming complaining to Apple isn't going to help but is there even an avenue for that?

I'm in a similar boat in Calgary. I'm desperately looking for something to do with them.

I really prefer bootable USB sticks for this since they aren't accessible to anything running on the host machine like key loggers.  I rather like CrunchBang Linux for this since it is Debian based, it's tiny and looks good by default, and it supports file system encryption out of the box (so losing a USB stick doesn't matter)
Two keys:
1. Permanently offline that stores my strongest GPG key (used primarily for backups), a copy of bitaddress.org, and paper wallets generated with offline with the bitaddress tool. The majority of my coins are stored in offline paper wallets. 
2. Online installation with electrum wallet and a heavy dose of firewall rules.  I figure if I run nothing else on this my exposure is pretty limited.

I've been pretty happy installing a minimalist Linux distro to a USB stick (Kingston makes a nice all metal one that survives on a keychain).  
That works out well because I can carry it with me and use old laptops I have at the office and at home.
I'm using Crunchbang linux because it's pretty, lightweight, and supports root/swap encryption out of the box.
Once you have it setup you can just nuke the networking stuff if you want it purely offline.

That's an interesting thought. I can see reluctance to allow proper on-device wallets for the liability.  I hadn't heard that before. 
That said, coinbase is just a web wallet so I think either there was a misunderstanding or something more sinister is going on...
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:11:16
Oh my. Yes!!  I totally hadn't thought of that but they are a perfect match!  
@_date: 2013-07-06 00:21:12
Good to hear. Thank you!

Sweet!  I was heading over to Edmonton for a wedding in a few weeks.  Finally somewhere local to spend some bitcoin.  I know where we're having lunch.

They must be taking advice from BFL...

Yeah. 100% secure sounds suspiciously like the sort of thing somebody who didn't know anything about security would say. Likewise with 100% tested.
