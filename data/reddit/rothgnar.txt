use gyft.com not egifter. egifter has lost several of my transactions since they made changes (still waiting for them to process or refund almost 2 BTC (21 days ago). Poor customer service too.

If you have time, Submit a BBB complaint. If enough complaints are received it will assist into an investigation into their business practices.

It appears egifter.com is now nothing more than a SCAM. I was waiting over 24 hours and when I inquired that said the order did not exist even though I have a screen shot of it and an email from them. The STOLE over $500 from me. They may have been decent in the past but no longer. SCAMMERS.
A week later I spoke with bitpay who confirmed that egifter.com have the funds. Now I have to speak with the local sheriff and report it as fraud. 
Alternatively, get a bitpay debit card or a coinbase debit card. I prefer coinbase as they don't convert the bitcoin till you make a purchase with the card.
bitpay - debit card have to load it with fiat and no way to select a PIN
coinbase - BTC converted on the fly. PIN can be chosen for free over the phone.

Sadly people use them as Poloniex have terrible support and double charge on many deposits. 12 hours to deposit many coins is unacceptable.

poloniex does this too but charges more.

Poloniex has sadly grown too big and now their customer service is almost non existent. Typically 72 hours to get a response if you're lucky.
