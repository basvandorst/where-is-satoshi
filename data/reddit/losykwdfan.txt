Super ultra noob here. Will this work with litecoin? And how do I go about transferring it to the ledger?

Thank you very much. I have an iMac so all I need is google chrome and it’ll be good to go?

What is that and how do I do it?

How about Jaxx?

I did just buy 3 LTC. But I see people complaining about coinbase(which is where I bought it) and how they charge percentage but I'm not experienced enough to really be sure of what ewallet or whatever I should use?

Yep I just downloaded it and signed up with a cc. What is eth and ltc?

So I'm a noob and hate to ask this but How exactly would I go about getting bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:16:42
Interesting. I really wish I understood all this a little better. Is there a reason as to why it may overtake it? 
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:41:47
Well I have a ton of questions about bitcoin and other crypto currencies because I really wanna start buying if it keeps going up like it has been. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:40:01
That'd be genuinely devastating lol.

I'm in it for the long term gains. But I'm not worried about losing some money. I probably won't stress too much over it. Hopefully anyways. But I'm oddly excited for this. It's my first investment of any kind.
