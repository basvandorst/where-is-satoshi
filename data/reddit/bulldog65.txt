I don't think Mt. Gox has any clearly incriminating evidence against him. he put up $3000 and got $1000 out. Now Mt. Gox is saying he will have negative account balance. If he is innocent Gox is ripping him off for a MINIMUM of $2000. Clearly Mt. Gox is at fault for letting hacker in, they should not get off scot-free at the expense of others. Mt. Gox needs to at least give him $3000 back and tell him take his business elsewhere. Throughout this whole drama at no point has Mt. Gox made any statement to the effect that they are willing to accept any loss for something that is at least partially their fault (IMHO 40% Gox, 60% hacker).

Not if Mt. Gox gets away with ripping people off.

Not trying to imply anything about your motives. I do however think it is important to realize bitcoins are an evolving digital currency in the early stages. All scams that have been pulled on people with real $$ will be modified for bitcoin. You and I may view bitcoin as a new form of anonymous currency, scammers view it as a new opportunity with built in protections. If bitcoin is to grow peoples need to be able to remain anonymous and protected.

I believe when he made withdrawal the ~675 coins were valued at the $1000 daily limit. Will be interesting to see how it plays out. For all we know Mt.Gox/Kevin/Hacker are all in this together, putting on a big smoke and mirrors show. I know the people that have large sum on site must be worried, lets hope everything comes out all right.

Hard to make a call on this. You seem sincere; one one hand you could be an astute student of the market that was willing to make a $3000 bet in the face of a crash, but could also be the hacker's "mr. clean" partner that just helped him launder 250k stolen bitcoin. Think it is probably a matter for a judge to decide. Do you have a long trade history of multi-thousand dollar buys in the market prior to this incident ? It will be interesting to see how all this plays out. One thing for sure no matter what happens somebody is gonna end up pissed off. The pissed off people do have legitimate gripes. Mt. Gox has just learned there is more to being an exchange than a website and fancy logo. It is also entirely possible the 500k acct. belonged to mt. gox (if so no wonder biggest acct./target), would like to see trade history and if they were playing clients to increase take.

I think the idea of a rollback is flawed. There were other legitimate transactions taking place worldwide at the same time the dirty deal went down. No matter how you slice it somebody is gonna get screwed for something that was not their fault if there is a rollback. The hacker should not be allowed to make a profit off stolen coins, and Mt. Gox should not be allowed to profit for inadequate security. If they cannot prove beyond a shadow of a doubt he was involved Gox should offer to buy "Kevin"s coins for a price that gives Kevin a profit, he did layout $3000, got $1000 worth out, and has a negative balance (with ~250K coins in it) as per Mt. Gox. Gox could also post a "no questions asked" reward for the rest of the coins. The recovered coins could then be put back in the accounts where they belong. Gox would have to make up any remaining missing coins. It would probably costs Gox 10~20 K, but they did incur a liability by advertising security that was apparently non-existent. They should have to pay something for letting millions of dollars worth of bitcoin get stolen from accounts under their control. The hacker might also get some money through the reward, akin to a "consultant" fee for demonstrating the security flaws. The list of any remaining missing coins would just effectively take those coins out of circulation.

Then it is only really attractive to those who are willing to disregard all security in hopes of anonymity, i.e. buying mail order drugs,kiddie porn DVD's, tax evasion, money laundering, etc.. Since I'm not doing any of that over the internet I'll stick with credit cards/paypal. Roll up the windows and lock the doors when your driving through the darknet part of town.

Yes if thousands of people lose millions of dollars with no recourse, I predict there will be many, many exchanges. I also predict the 1/2 life of the exchanges and bitcoin will drastically shrink.

Yes, buyer beware. Hence need a list of bad coin and escrow. It is in the exchanges best interests. Otherwise there is HUGE incentive to set up exchange and then when enough $$ in it make an announcement "Sorry folks we (and by "we", we mean You) got ripped off" . Then just set up another website and do it all again.
@_date: 2011-06-22 19:57:55
Why do clerks at stores use identification pens on large bills ? Coins have also been stolen from peoples accounts at other sites using the leaked passwords. I'm sure there might be some black market for bad coin, but merchants have right of refusal just as with counterfeit $$. Who deserves to get screwed more, someone buying/accepting stolen coin or the person the coins are stolen from. There is no FDIC, so the exchanges need to put their $$ where their mouths are and insure every account up to $ XX.XX as long as you are in compliance with their security protocols. 
@_date: 2011-06-22 23:58:10
So are saying bitcoin needs to be eliminated ? I was hopeful the interweb community could provide themselves with at least the same level of protections that governments provide citizens. If there is no recourse then the dishonest have an inherent advantage. From stealing to setting up "fronts" as exchanges that can be hosted in a jurisdiction of the scammer's choosing. Even at an "honest" exchange it will only take one bad apple with the proper access to steal millions with much higher probability of success than in real world.

Well there was a contest for a new logo  ....thought I had a shot  Oh well c'est la vie.

I admit I know next to nothing about bitcoin. If it is going through constant development, then perhaps this is an issue that can be addressed in the future. Maybe something that does not identify user but verifies coin as legit prior to transfer. Then if coins are stolen rightful owners can activate an alert.

The trades were made from every hacked account. Mt. Gox should make everyone whole to their satisfaction and eat the loss if they want to be a reputable exchange. The fault is theirs. There are inherent risks associated with running an exchange. Your first priority should be security to protect integrity of the market. They never even bothered changing the name, all in all a very amateurish effort. Still I bet they have made enough $$ to pay for this error,and put proper security in place. It will sting them, but that leads to a lesson being learned. The question is do they have the integrity to do so.

This would be a good way to gather data on peoples Bitcoin holdings and attack them with wallet trojan.
