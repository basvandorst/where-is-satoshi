That sounds like a fantastic business model.  The keys would be small and close together for their tiny hands ...

I've got to admit ... the one time I liquidated my shorts was VERY embarrassing.

Make certain she understands she doesn't *need* to convert the *entire* BTC to fiat ...

It absolutely is.

Good thought, but how can you put in $30 a bit at a time without getting massacred by fees?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:37
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:14:58
Hell, I would have done that (i.e beg for BTC), but it's explicitly against the rules here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:38:51
I don't get paid well, but I'm hoping *Bitcoin* will pay me well.

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:30:45
That would be $6.5M today.
You're very well-adjusted to not be bothered by that.  I would be.

[GoFundMe]( is what you need.  Obviously they deal in fiat, not Bitcoin.

That's not what John McAfee says ...
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:47:21
I like this option.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:40:54
I don't have that particular technical know-how, but I wish you well on your quest.  $120K is nothing to sneeze at.
I've used Bittrex without incident for months now and haven't had any issues ... yet.  I have a handful of alts in there, but I do most of my business (and have most of my holdings) on Coinbase/GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:51:14
Not even for eating crackers?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:21
Did you buy a nice framed picture of a Lambo?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:18:50
Depends on whether you're willing to hodl.  Put that $50 in and wait a few years.  It *might* yield something useful.  It would be better if you could *keep* putting $50 in every week or month.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:30:46
Certainly not for "one of those bitcoins".  $3.50 would buy you a very small fraction of a bitcoin, and would be wiped out by fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:31:24
You obviously should.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:21:22
Probably not.  How about a used Yugo?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:10:14
Sneak into your parents' room while they're asleep.  Pull a few twenties out of dad's wallet.  Invest.  Hodl.
I'm just kidding.

When can I stop holding them?  People are looking at me funny ...
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:49:19
I like the cut of your jib.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:35:57
Those lambos aren't going to buy *themselves*.  Bittrex needs to at least give you a status report.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:26:59
Yes, you *literally* can't wait!
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:49:45
Using "af" sounds ratchet AF.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:48:33


Well, technically there is.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:27:16
Yes, you *literally* can't wait!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:38:23
That is some top-notch illustrating.

I'd take 10% BTC (possibly 15%).
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:44:36
Did new ownership affect the way GDAX operates in any way?  If not, why does it matter?  Despite the high fees, Coinbase serves a useful purpose.
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:07:12
Or split the difference. Diversification is good too.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:16:44
Coinbase, if you don't mind the fees.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:58:59
You'll need to liquidate some of your Bitcoin to pay for the indecent exposure citation.

@_date: 2017-10-13 19:48:59
I can't wait to sell when it's a $500k bubble.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:58:36
You obviously held a whole lot more BTC than I do.  I need for it to pop **big** to get to that point.
