I don’t think he is highly regarded for his intellect, which makes you wonder how he got to where he is.

Yuh like never, how about if the Gold price inflates because the value of FIAT got debased .... because at some point they decided to, errr, abolish the good standard?

Wouldn’t it just be “rate of return” then, the compounding is implicit.

So simple, deflation so simple. Why is no one working anymore? Oh we don’t need to, just sit and wait, become rich, so simples.

Apologies, I was being sarcastic, deflation is no better than inflation, everything in moderation. Global bitcoinisation would bring massive deflation and it would be very hard to sustain reasonable levels of aggregate demand to sustain anyone having the will to do very much at all.

I agree and that stable value is a function of how much people are prepared to adopt it and the rate/breadth of that adoption. At some point the balance between people HODLing and people spending would need to shift.

The problem at the moment is not many brokers are offering short positions so the market is even more skewed from the cash market. Until they get over that hurdle I would imagine volumes will remain relatively low. They need to figure out how to margin it first.

Sounds legit

If you are already wealthy Gold without question, if you aren’t then you have nothing to lose so it could be crypto currency would just depend which you pick.

Yes and so many disciplined investors in the crypto space. Those classic investor war cry’s... HODL and... to the moon. These markets are a rabble and have anything but discipline.

It will take you 14 days to buy a loaf of bread, the loaf will cost $1 but you will spend $12,000 on fee’s, $400 on snacks while you wait and $1400 on overnight accommodation.

I think you must have a different definition of liquidity, there is no real liquidity in crypto, that is the issue and the source of the volatility.

Well said, notwithstanding the economic disincentives that come with deflation. 
In any economy the ability to balance both inflationary forces and deflationary ones is important to economic stability.

Acclaimed academic who understands economics speaking out in support of cryptocurrencies vs random internet opinion. Something is wrong here.

I wasn’t suggesting that, I understand what you meant. I was just alluding to what my understanding is of his harsh sentencing based on what I read at the time. To add to that I don’t think he was treated consistently and the system clearly doesn’t work, but I do believe he and his lawyer compounded his own problems by not showing sufficient respect for the law or legal process.
@_date: 2019-02-14 08:55:59
Certainly part of his sentencing was the lack of remorse and recognition of the crimes. Whatever anyone’s personal beliefs about drugs, any modern society needs to be able to uphold laws and apply them. If you can believe what you read there was a complete lack of recognition of the crimes and his defence tried to justify Silk Road as being a safe and user friendly market place for drugs that had the best interests of its users at heart.
Whilst anyone can argue that the sentencing is harsh/even pointless given your typical human lifespan. Any argument pertaining to be above the law is misguided at best. Sentencing is not a time to facilitate structural legal change.

Meh, without fundamentals I don’t see it as viable, as for social listening I’m hoping Reddit doesn’t feature as you would struggle to eradicate bias or you just end up chasing pump and dumps.

None, you just persuade people to trust your DIY stable coin.
