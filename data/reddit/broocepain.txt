In my limited experience I figured why not. It's cheap but I'm not in a rush, im about to go to sleep. 
That fee is crazy high for a transaction of around 500CAD. 
Where do you find out that ETA information? I have the opportunity to bump my transaction but it's around $35 so if rather wait. 16hours is awhile...but I'll survive if that's a for sure thing.

Weeks.....months.....fuck eh. I thought I was being wise by being thrifty...i can't believe the time estimation would be so off. 
I'll be sure to take a look at that once I'm not mobile. Bit of a pain in the rear. 
I'll sit on it a bit longer. I was reading that I could get a miner to push it, I'm thinking I'll try that. Pay my miner buddy 10 bucks and see if he can push it through for me.

I'll definitely pay him something. As long as it's cheaper than the $35 CPFP mycelium wants. 
I'll wait a bit longer. I checked out that link you mentioned. I'm around 9-10hrs into waiting now. Fingers crossed. 
At the end of the day this is a lesson for me going forward. Optimism.. .

Making my first cash purchase this Friday..to dip my toes in. In lieu of having a hard wallet, given the ship times, can you suggest a good wallet to serve in the interim?

What do you mean by that? I've noticed that cash prices tend to be a bit lower than those of credit or otherwise. 
I'm holding out on a trezr l, at least at first until I've accumulated a decent amount of coin. At first a regular wallet (still open to suggestions on this one) seems like it would be fine for me. Unless I'm just a dumby.
