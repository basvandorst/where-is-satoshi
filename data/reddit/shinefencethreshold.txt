On what basis do you say that its unlikely never to get above 20k? The truth is that the bitcoin price is a random number generator and putting a significant chunk of your savings into it is very very risky. Yes you have lots of people who bought at $1 and are now very rich but hindsight is always 20/20 and nobody can predict a future price.

But wages have gone up hugely in the past 317 years, the economy based on the GBP is one of the worlds biggest, these cheery picked figures represent people clutching at bitcoin straws!

@_date: 2018-06-26 17:05:57
But who can predict that with any confidence? All the predictions I see here are based on faith and wanting it to be true. Don't get me wrong I think a decentralised currency etc is great but that doesnt mean I think it will take off. This sub is a such a tiny non-representative sample of society that our belief means very little. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:47:38
The problem is that, while its true that 1 BTC=1 BTC, it's gone from 1 BTC=deposit on house to 1 BTC=second hand car and might fall further.
 1 BTC=1 BTC is only comforting if shops and businesses are selling everything in BTC and their own supply chain is also in BTC, and their suppliers supply chain (i.e. the world economy).

It's easy to make sense of things retrospectively, and you can spot any pattern you like if you look hard enough, like people who see Jesus in a slice of toast.
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:47:32
But that would mean that the builders are paid in BTC, the builders buy supplies from companies which sell bricks in BTC, the brick factory pays its workers in BTC, the workers buy food in BTC, etc etc. Sorry to sound negative but I don't think the daily posts of Slovenian taxi drivers and swiss cake shops accepting BTC is really going to cut it.

In terms of % volatility there isn't a clear trend there to be honest, and in terms of fluctuations in absolute value who knows. Bank deposits are insured by federal deposit protection so no worries. I've recently learnt to detach predictions from my own presonal feelings, confidence, beliefs and what I want to happen, and its been an eye-opener!

@_date: 2018-11-19 07:33:57
People are really clutching at straws now! So because stretching the X axis considerably makes bitcoin look a little bit like the price of something that went up after going down, that means that the price people are prepared to pay for a bitcoin will do the same! Solid reasoning!
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:35:00
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:35:08
People say that a wedge breaks up or down but what is the point in knowing that? All people are saying by that is that the price will go up, or down, at some point in the future.
This is what gets me about TA: a lot of the high-certainty predictions seem to be fairly meaningless. Along the lines of 'the tightening wedge will break up, or down, or could stay flat for some time.'
@_date: 2018-11-19 07:30:21
How come none of the TA people saw this coming then? I've read loads of TA on here over the past 2 months saying 6 k was the absolute bottom and we would soon go up to 7 k and then onwards. I read absolutely nothing about 5.4 k. Maybe TA is people drawing lines to fit what they want to believe will happen :p
@_date: 2018-11-19 07:53:32
Yes. What makes TA more annoying is that there arre some correct predictions just because so many people are saying so many different things that they get lucky once in a while, (monkeys on typewriters). To them this confirms absolutely everything forever and they think that they can actually forecast price movements.

The market can remain irrational for longer then you can stay solvent. Forget bitcoin and do whatever you can to save your finances. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:47:49
But what use is that if you don't know if its going up or down, or when? It's like the weather forecaster saying 'there will be some weather'.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:52:59
These lines on charts mean nothing as you can draw them and justify them anywhere to make any conclusion that you want. In reality there is no way to know where the price is going based on where it has already been, chartists are doomed to fail.
It's funny to give chartists, and even professional ones, a randomly generated share price and watch them talk about support levels, Fibonachi and rising triangles :p People believe in 'reading the charts' because it did make a lot of profit, but only in the boom years when everything was going up and you made a profit if you chose randomly (historically that would have given a bigger profit than many strategies).

@_date: 2018-02-01 12:40:42
Yes its clear that Bitcoin will remain but that doesn't mean anything about the price, as most people are buying it because they think somebody else will pay more for it in the future. There doesn't seem to be support for 10 k as it is now at 9.2. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:35:06
Only if people are making the same conclusions with TA. One trader might draw the lines in a way that forecasts a rise in price while another might make the lines fit in a way that forecasts a fall in price. You can draw whatever lines you want to give whatever price you want so I guess that makes it less self fulfilling.
And I know enough that I didnt buy any bitcoin when they were expensive, but was ignorant enough not to buy them when they were cheap, so I've made a nice round $0 loss (buying nothing makes you beta-neutral :p )
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:01:26
 This is painful to watch, people on here are really trying to convince themselves its going back up and I feel sorry for people who have lost money. Nobody has a clue where the price is going.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:44:51
Past performance is no indicator etc etc
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:22:55
Correct, this is an obvious trend! It's tragic to watch people drawing random lines through a very noisy graph of an asset with no fundamentals and then watch them throw away their money. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:41:45
Again, somebody using a log axis to make it look like it hasnt fallen as far. More delusion. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:40:23
There's no way of knowing that, apart from the fact that its closer to zero. The price of bitrcoin is determined by how much people think somebody in the future might pay for it, which makes it very hard to predict anything at all.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:23:31
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:01:46
past performance is no indicator of future performance (this should be automatically posted by a bot every time somebody mentions a 'pattern'.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:36:35
Absolutely right, great analogy with the tea leaves. Whenever somebody comes up with a prediction of a complex system based on some method they've made up, its a good exercise to pretend you believe the opposite to their prediction and then to see if you can use their method to prove you are correct as well. Now if we start plotting moving averages, drawing trend channels and right angled triangles and drawing support levels on when the price has randomly fluctuated upwards, we could justify whatever price we wanted.
The financial world has a lot of this chartist rubbish in it because people made lots of money from it, but only during the long period when everything was going up anyway! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:40:43
But does it provide better returns than choosing randomly or buying FTSE or S and P 500 trackers? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:01:22
So you lost on bitcoin and the solution is to use the money you earn not to repay the loan but to buy more bitcoin? Nothing is every 100 % guaranteed to go back up.

"Last chance to buy at 6 k!" 
Lots of people were saying that for the last month or two, and I suppose they were correct! Just not in the way they expected. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:54:36
They look at the fundamental data of the companies, they go and visit factories, talk to CEOs and accountants, wander round warehouses and look at labs etc. Can't do that with bitcoin. They also have people who do mathematical modelling and use data science and machine learning etc to look for patterns and trends, like correlations between company fundamentals and the price etc. Can't do that with bitcoin either.
Good forecasting in most fields is a combination of human intuition (e.g. their new CEO knows what he's doing and their products look good) and mathematical modelling. 
It's how weather forecasts are so successful in the UK (despite what people think, the met office raw data is very accurate for 24 hours in advance). The computers crunch the numbers and calculate the probability of a storm, and the old sea-dogs look at the isobars and use their experience. Then they combine the computers and the sea-dogs to make a judgement. I think a good few redditors think they are the old sea-dogs who can read the chart and feel it in their bones. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:55:29
But chartism is getting less popular and I think the redditors scribbling lines on graphs are trading much less that the big players so ti doesnt have an effect in this case.

Then you're living on another planet! It's painful watching this happen and hearing the level of delusion on here. USD loses 2 to 3 % of its value per year due to inflation and is backed by the worlds largest economy, bitcoin has lost 80 % in a year and is only valued by what you think somebody else will think somebody else will want to pay for it in the future. It's painful watching people ruin themselves over this.

@_date: 2018-12-07 00:24:49
Yes but its annoying to see people who are seriously in the red being told to DCA to bring their average cost down. I saw this happen to people who bought at 20 k and they were told to DCA in at 15 k, 10 k, 6 k etc which has made their position much worse. If you loose a bit of money on a speculative gample then dont throw more in thinking you can win it back with DCA.
