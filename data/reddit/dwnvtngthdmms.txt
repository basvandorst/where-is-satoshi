You honestly think its *lost*?
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:27:34
Instant? no. Secure? no, anonymous? no, fees? yes
Seems like all the things people were yelling about bitcoin just isnt true, why are people constantly making these claims?
Edit: Forgot, Easy? no
@_date: 2012-10-12 04:57:07
Count yourself lucky you only lost a little, a lot of people in bitcoin have/will lose their shirt.
@_date: 2012-10-13 01:10:30
You make a snarky comment and tried to say the only attribute of libertarianism was non aggression, I told you not to be foolish, and there was a lot more to it. 
If you can't handle someone calling you foolish for your views, you are going have a hell of a time with the rest of the libertarian movement.
@_date: 2012-10-12 04:45:11
You sir, are an ass, just turn off the lights if you want to disappoint children.
@_date: 2012-10-12 09:31:17
Normally I would say yeah I agree, but its bitcoins man... calling them "very cool" even for the "nerdy" kids, is really stretching it.  
Thats not all eh, the community isn't exactly child friendly... or something I'd want my young child to be involved in, libertarianism, which seems to be at the core of the bitcoiners world is a really shitty thing to be teaching other people's children.
Maybe my view is skewed, I've followed bitcoins from a few weeks before the big rise to 35, and my main source was the SA thread, chock full of sceptics debunking and pointing out the failures so readily, I was in the chat room when bruce's phone fell down.
@_date: 2012-10-13 00:21:41
Dont be foolish, there is much more to libertarianism than non-aggression.
@_date: 2012-10-12 08:10:17
If bitcoins were useful and easy to get into I might agree with you, but...
@_date: 2012-10-13 02:10:48
For calling you out on being foolish?  It would be different if you *weren't* being so...  You know full well the libertarian movement is leaps and bounds more than non aggression.
@_date: 2012-10-12 13:47:16
In a free society I am allowed to voice my opinions you insufferable cunt.
@_date: 2012-10-12 05:57:00
No, he's trying to push an agenda on a night that's supposed to be fun for children, he's being ridiculous.
There is not a single child I know that would not be disappointed if they received bitcoins on halloween.
@_date: 2012-10-12 13:49:43
Good to hear you are giving out other stuff too, just as long as it isn't cosby coins.
@_date: 2012-10-12 04:46:41
You have the idea of halloween all fucking wrong, you are a bad person.
@_date: 2012-10-12 04:46:16
Please don't do this, its halloween not bitcoin advertisement night.
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:00:28
Wait a bit perhaps, the paywall goes up and down depending on traffic.
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:10:01
The thing is, if you aren't actively searching for the downsides, you aren't likely to find them, you can research all day, and come away thinking it's great, so many people spout off bitcoin's positive traits, then ignore the negative sides, they generally refuse to listen.  
Is bitcoin neat, sure yeah, cyrpto currency, electronic money, however you want to see it, its certainly the future, but this particular iteration really wasn't meant to be anything more than a proof of concept, it has serious flaws.  People with stake in bitcoin however, don't want you to see btc as anything but the awesome future, you buy bitcoins, you use bitcoins, their value goes up and the early adopters make a pile of cash, they don't seem to be interested in developing a usable currency, just making this particular one work.
@_date: 2013-08-09 07:04:47
Ah, thanks, its interesting to understand the people involved, it almost feels like a "wild west" environment, a redo of earlier times.
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:18:56
Out of curiosity... you had to wade through a gauntlet of warning signs, what was it that made you think it was a smart decision?
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:14:10
I appreciate the time partner thanks.
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:51:09
Any attitude you detect is a product of your mind.
I was tempted myself but the bitcoin world seemed to be a microcosm of earlier times with unregulated economics, was that part of the draw?
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:44:54
What made them the honorable one in a known den of thieves to you?
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:42:35
I've been following since it hit a few dollars for the first time, so ya.  Except I followed it on the SomethingAwful forums, and I guess, because of the huge numbers of scams already, people there just straight up assumed they were a scam, or at least much less "honorable" than they made themselves out to be.
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:43:52
oh fuck me, huge thing written out and i guess I hit backspace without the window here selected, went back a page and now its all gone, god dammit I thought Chrome saved that shit.  Annoying as fuck, whole mood fucking trashed now.  FUCK.
And fuck man, thats a heck of alot to read for a simple answer.  Im not that interested in bitcoin, yet, probably because I cant ever get  a straight fucking answer, even the nice people are all half truths.
@_date: 2013-10-17 13:48:14
Silicon, read your history, the world was and is not like the states is/was.
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:55:10
Hah awesome, makes sense, and thanks for not being all indignant like some other folks here :)
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:14:24
By paid do you mean, you walked in, started the process, ate, and the process finished after or during?  Or did it finish before you ate?  Was there a wait between starting the process and them being sure they had the money?  Are they working on good faith?  What I'm trying to get at here is how *effectively* similar it is to say a debit or credit card to both sides in the same situation?  Are you using an app on a common smart phone to do this?  Is it as fool proof and accessible as say an atm machine?
Edit:  I think you'd just be better off with the price always going up, you'd recieve less btc but the same fiat amount, and if it goes up so does your capability to buy with it.  If they cant pay for you for some reason in fiat, but can in bitcoin (I cant imagine why that would be, though it seems like a bit of a problem sometimes to convert btc to fiat at will and quick enough for a payroll payment) then I would understand if you wanted the coins to stay low if it was a temporary job, otherwise... I'm kind of lost on why you'd want them not to keep going up, though I lost a though writing that, short term memory sometimes fails me.
@_date: 2013-08-09 05:20:02
Dont be an asshole, come on.
@_date: 2013-08-09 05:17:00
If you are looking to actually make money for college, stay the hell away from bitcoin, what are you crazy?  Look, is a very very bad echo chamber, do yourself a favor, spend 10 of those dollars on a SomethingAwful.com account, and post in their bitcoin thread for advice, you're going to get infinitely better advice there than this den of people incapable of taking off their rose colored glasses.
@_date: 2013-08-09 04:48:49
You miss a massive slave built and run city?   How in the ever loving fuck do people actually view dubai as a positive place still?  You *KNOW* it was built by slaves, you *KNOW* its run by slaves, and you still talk about it like its a nice place, you fucking sicken me.
@_date: 2013-08-15 20:19:56


Do some searching for the bad things, this is an echo chamber, you own't hear about them here or in bitcoin sponsored media outlets.  Truth is, they're a joke, here is the SA thread, they tend to highlight why you dont want to get involved 
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:44:23
What about the huge number of other scams involved with bitcoin?  The bitcoin scene was something like 50% scams at that point, what made you trust them instead of say pirate or the plethora of other whose names I have long forgotten.
@_date: 2013-02-14 20:34:08
Hey, check out the somethingawful thread, then as quickly as you can, get the fuck out of bitcoin, your family deserves more from you.
@_date: 2013-08-16 22:47:59
I rest my case.

@_date: 2013-08-09 07:29:50
I wont pretend to know what I'm talking about mate/matess, my life is a sorry shambles, I've just been following bitcoin for awhile and its very volatile, can you make a bunch of money? ya maybe, alot of people have, can you lose a bunch? ya maybe, alot of people have, sorry if I came off as a dick there, that was uninteded, and I dont mean to be squashing your confidence or dreams or anything like that, please dont feel like I'm an authority that knows what I'm talking about.  
But, do check out somethingawful, for all its many faults, its a useful resource, especially for life advice, it is brutally honest though, and people are not afraid to be mean, so be prepared, and has a bunch of rules that they will ban you for if you break, so do read them if you get an account, its free sometimes, when bandwidth gets "low" it cuts off free access, its honestly one of the best 10$ purchases I've ever made.  
They will likely say press the every job and every scholarship claim, will question all your finances and perhaps recommend an alternate courses of action, there are many professionals willing to offer advice there.  They may ask if you need to go to that particular college, they may not have different advice from other knowledge people.  Be sure, if you are getting advice about all that stuff, you seek out multiples sources and knowledgeable people, and don't just assume, if someone has a job as some sort of life counselor, that they know, people may be well meaning, but thats not good enough when youre talking about things that effect the rest of your life.
Also be sure to check out how to eat cheaply yet "well", don't let yourself eat poorly nutrition wise, your brain has a mammoth need for a halfway decent diet, and this is a pretty important time for your brain to be working goodly like.
Oh, and maybe not actually post in their bitcoin thread, read it first, you'll probably find someone with the same questions, they are very much ***not*** pro bitcoin over there, keep that in mind.  
@_date: 2013-08-09 07:06:52
Oh my bad too, my bowl was unsmoked and my coffee cup still full, that has a certain unintended effect sometimes.
@_date: 2013-10-17 14:09:06
..so a scam.
@_date: 2013-10-17 14:53:33
If you are just using it as a currency, or even to build wealth, wouldn't you want it to be worth more than when you paid "fiat" for it?  The coins you bought yesterday to use today are now worth a few cents/dollars more, are you sure you want it to go down?  If it just keeps going up you are always making money, if it goes down just a little you've lost perhaps, depends on when you bought, sure you can then buy and recoup, but couldn't you have just bought anyways, and made money if it kept going up?
 Those fees will be going up sooner than later, unless something changes in the mining world its going to get real unprofitable, rather soon.  And I really must question your wording here so I understand it, you got the bill, pulled out your device, started the process/pressed send, and 10 seconds later they accepted this and you left?  Like, theres no hidden time in here that I would notice if I was standing there?  **Edit**: How long from being handed the bill to walking out?  Any "preloading" going on?  Not starting the process halfway through dinner? **End edit** Keep in mind I dont use it myself, I read alot about it, it fascinates me, but I dont use it so I'm always wary of someone trying to pull the wool over people's eyes by trickery of language and whatnot, someone actually argued with me that "instant" means up to half an hour.  If so, do you have a prior relationship with this business?  Basically, do they trust you?  Somehow I doubt it happened as easy as you're making it out to be, no offence, but not once, when questioned has someone's clarified story been what I would call easy, or quick.  
Edited a couple sentences in there

No, the warning signs were the massive amount of scams going on in the bitcoin world at the time, SA just pointed them out, I agree, it is a very caustic place, I haven't spent much time there since I found reddit, but what made BFL the good guys in your eyes?
@_date: 2013-08-09 07:00:46
Ah, right on, thanks, I love history and dont really do much else with my time, bitcoin feels like history in the making, and bitcoin's economy so far seems like like a bit of a repeat of crazy times past, so its interesting to get inside the heads of some of the actors if you know what I mean.
@_date: 2013-08-09 04:54:45
Stop being a cunt, tell people what they will actually be doing.
@_date: 2013-10-17 13:55:19
Dont immediately disregard people that arent pro bitcoin, ya that moron doesnt have a leg to stand on but there are numerous huge concerns, I really honestly doubt bitcoin will be the crypto currency of the future, its a good learning tool, but it will not see widescale adoption, its nothing it claims to be, what you have right now are people with a stake in getting the value higher, so they make it seem like its better than it is, what with all the "no fees" "anonymous" "easy" "instant" etc etc claims that are pretty much false.
@_date: 2013-08-16 05:39:45
No, I am not, I don't believe its something worth contributing to, and I dont think its nearly as viable as many people think.  The claims right now far outweigh the actual benefits, and some claims are straight up false, like ease of use, security, anonymity, etc.
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:00:06
Try again after a bit, the paywall goes up and down depending on how much traffic the site is getting.
@_date: 2013-08-09 06:53:45
Just seemed like there was more than a couple established companies, already doing large amounts of business in the bitcoin world that turned out to be a scam, disappearing into the night, perhaps to pop up again some time later to say they were hacked or robbed or something.  I could scarcely believe the number of times I said out loud "again?!".
