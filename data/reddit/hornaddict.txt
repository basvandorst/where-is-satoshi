Yes repo market isn’t printing money just short term loans but once the fed is involved they are printing money to give to the repo market and provide liquidity. Fed even came out saying they won’t disclose which banks are receiving the repo money until 2 years from now.

Too volatile to do all that

No need to convince you if you dont understand it. You gotta learn the history about money and where it comes from to understand why bitcoin has so much value

Yess lol I mean the 2017 bull run did it like nothing from like 7k-20k in less than a month
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:56:26
Well yeah I didn’t expect it to stay up after a wild run up. I think you keep mistaking the value of bitcoin to its price actions. While it does contribute to its value a little bit

I think he had a legit question. If this bear market was to last longer even after the halving would they give up on bitcoin?  Personally I wouldn’t because all the benefits that come from bitcoin and fiat value shouldn’t matter. 1 btc=1 btc

Taxes in u.s for crypto already give me a headache. If you’re gambling I’m guessing you took losses to but if you came out and profited I don’t think there’s much to do

Living up to the 2jz is going to take a lot . That engine is damn near bulletproof

If you’re under 18 you need to find an atm that doesn’t require I.D verification but does come most of the time with a 20% or more premium

What you’re talking about does have some sense to it ... it’s called hypothecation because of this method it caused the 08 housing crisis. Long story short to avoid this you should own your private keys �� not your keys not your bitcoin

It’s be funny if it’s somehow just pumps all way to 16 with then 30 days lol

If he is gifting 14k in bitcoin I’m sure he has a lot to lose if the irs would come audit him and say he is doing tax evasion if didn’t do his taxes if that’s the case

Post this in the r/silverbugs lol

Can’t even transfer my bitcoin . It’s really annoying
@_date: 2019-09-23 06:56:29
This is the movie that probably got me more into bitcoin when it first came out but I was 16 at the time and no btc atm in my city so I couldn’t take action as soon as I wanted
