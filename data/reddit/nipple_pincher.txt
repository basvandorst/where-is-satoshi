Then all you have to do is reinstall bitcoin-qt and replace the wallet.dat that is in c:\users\yourusername\appdata\roaming\bitcoin with this one and you're done.

Western Union can easily use Bitcoin if they follow the formula I suggested.  
Ordinary folks in many countries have a hard time accessing bitcoin.  Folks in the US do as well.
Western Union should open up their own exchanges then allow folks to send money choosing either bitcoin or traditional methods.

Like I said, you're stuck on their old business model.  Maybe you should run their company.  The end result would be the same.  Sigh.

Don't be down too much my friend, without folks selling, bitcoin would not have succeeded.  Most don't understand this but there must be a liquid market for this to work.
Buy just 5 now and in a few years, they'll be worth 5 million and you can brag to everyone how YOU were one of the guys that helped save mankind from the treachery of banks.  You can do that in your 800k home.

Lol...what a dickish start to a comment.  Dude I've been in business for myself for 30 fucking years.  I know exactly how Subway operates.
I also know that franchise owners are very aware of what other franchise owners are doing and the impact it has on their bottom line.
My comment still stands.

"The bitcoin craze"
That should be remembered.

Blockbuster or Netflix.  That's the choice they have.
They have a good name.  They can buy Coinbase right now and open 100 of them across the globe.  They can use these as additional revenue AND a way to offer a new money transmittal service.  There are many that will want an authority to handle their money transmission for them for a much smaller fee.
You are stuck on their current business model.  This will be dead in 5-10 years.

They are being pushed into this by the Federal Reserve.  The intent is to get a feeling for things before they reveal their hand.

Hmm...a jew not supporting a decentralized currency.  Never saw that one coming.

Great job!  We all need to support our bitcoin economy.
