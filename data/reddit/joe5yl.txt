That's cool but I can't find any place in L.A. to use bitcoin.  I've asked local restaurants and they don't know WTF I'm talking about.  I think it would do great here because it's so international and there is money being sent out of the US on a huge scale.  You'd think it would be huge in K-Town.

I understand.  Still, as a buyer I'd probably buy a $50 item on ebay or online with a credit card rather than risk $90 in bitcoin to get the same item for $45.  Sellers can post whatever they want.  It's a sucker bet for buyers.  Also, if I have $50 to spend on something I don't automatically have $100 at my fingertips to risk.  This is incredibly unappealing for buyers.  There will have to be a huge incentive (low low prices, exclusive merchandise) for buyers to use it.

Not to be a spoiler but here are some reasons credit cards are better:
1. Widely accepted
2. You can carry around your entire credit limit (say $30K) in your pocket yet only be liable for $50 in case of theft.
3. You can borrow against your credit line.

I think part of it is the way people think and how they accept things.  For example I understand the concept but I'm not interested in mining so I only know the basics.  If someone feels like they have to know mining and all the little details before they can see the big picture it probably takes longer.  Sort of like needing to know the entire theory of electricity before turning on a light.

I mean purchasing power of BTC denominated in BTC.  In other words if 1 BTC today will be 10% more valuable (meaning you can get +.1x more stuff) in 1 year then just charge 11% interest.  I don't see why lending couldn't adjust and accurately price the interest rate.  
I'm not an expert but all a deflationary currency does is increase the cost of lending in proportion to the increased return of savings.   
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:28:04
An advantage of BTC over credit cards is that you don't have to share your identifying information with every with every waiter, bartender, car wash attendant, etc. you come into contact with.  
Also you don't risk the credit card company putting a freeze on your account because of unusual activity.

I'm basically building two different buckets.  I have my long term holdings which are just that -- long term.  Then I've got everyday which I spend freely because I like using it.  
The cool thing is if there is a big rise my buying power increases in bitcoin that I already have (in my spend bucket) but it stays the same for anything new (If I'm buying a $25 gyft card it doesn't matter if bitcoin is worth $1 or $1000 because I just need to buy $25).

Here's how it falls apart:
1. Buyer &amp; Seller put bitcoin at risk
2. Seller sends Buyer goods
3. Buyer receives goods
4. Buyer lies to NASHX and claims buyer did not receive goods
5. All funds are destroyed and buyer still has goods!!
Do not underestimate the craziness of buyers!!!
@_date: 2013-07-30 15:42:01
From the model it doesn't look like the Seller can dispute after being paid by the Buyer.  The Buyer doesn't technically pay the Seller.  Funds are released to the Seller once Buyer says they have received goods.  There's nothing for the seller to dispute because he knows the fund are there before he sends goods.  The Buyer is the only party that can dispute.

Thanks.  I have a lower opinion of tipping than most people I'm guessing.  One of the reasons I love Australia -- no tipping!
Anyway tipping is literally optional.  Nothing is requiring me to tip.  I can see how someone would think it's ransom but the way I look at it is it's better than not tipping.  Leave the server out for a second.  Should I really worry that the valet guy is too lazy to get an address to get his tip?  It's my money why shouldn't I decide how to spend it?    
If I put on the card +$5 tip are they really not going to go through the effort?

After looking at these other conversations I think those solutions are overly complex because they are denominated in bitcoin.  The card I'm envisioning would say that it's worth $2.

So either the buyer or the seller can blow up the box at any time?  I'm not clear on that.  Also, it isn't clear that the purchase price (in this case the $100 for bitcoin/buyer risking $200) is put in the box.  It looks like the buyer puts in $100 in the box and the other $100 is sent directly to the seller.  It was pointed out to me on this thread that the seller has to receive the funds so it's not an automatic release from the box (or is it?)

If you are the seller be aware of your surroundings when you leave the transaction site.  A criminal team would have his buddy watch you and then wait for you to leave and rob you in a private area.  Always have to have your head up when you're dealing in cash.  Another good reason to meet in a bank.  You can take the cash and deposit it straight into your bank account.  Or if you are the buyer you can withdraw on site.

Initially it would always be worth $2 because the first step is to send me the wallet address to deposit the BTC.  Once I get the request I send $2 worth of BTC.  That is a big difference from the other example which are denominated in BTC from day one.  
After they receive the BTC the risk is up to them same as fiat.
I think the cool thing if I got one is I could just regift it and not even worry about getting the BTC wallet.  It's just like a Starbucks card.

a merchant can use a company like Bitpay so the merchant wouldn't have to touch bitcoin.  Customer pays with bitcoin, Bitpay takes the bitcoin then puts $USD in merchant bank account.  Bitpay fee 1%.  Zero charge backs.  It's a better deal than credit cards.

This sounds too good to be true:
"Your deposits are insured and earn interest each day. The current max APR is 27.25%. Don't face a loss with lending yourself where defaults affect you!"
Specifically that APR is very high, and this is saying that the default risk is "insured" (there's no insurance policy from what I can tell -- he's using "insured" informally to mean he'll cover the default risk).  Compare this to a peer-to-peer lending site such as prosper.com where the top rated loans are only getting 6-8% and the default risk is estimated around 1.5% for an estimated return of 5%.

If you have a regular (stripper, prostitute, massage etc) you are usually paying two fees -- the regular fee (say for a message) and a tip (for the extra).  It should be simple to switch your tips over to bitcoin if the worker is willing (if you're a regular you could even pay the tip later in the day so you don't have to fumble with your phone).  Less likely for the entire transaction (fee plus tip) because the fee is going from the worker to the boss.  Of course a problem if you're tipping for illegal services is people get lazy and don't change addresses.

Tell them to ignore it for two months.  Then make a calendar reminder to check the exchange rate after two months.  If they've realized a better return than cash you win.

you're young.  If you don't need it put in bitcoin and don't worry.  If you lose it all you have plenty of time to make more.  The price isn't too ridiculous right now.  what else are you going to do?  Put it in the bank for 1%?  Put into stocks which either have a low return or are super risky?  A smart way to keep yourself from being greedy is to make benchmarks -- for example once/if your stash is worth $2000 cash out $500.  Then if it crashes you've only lost $1000.  Or just buy some gift cards with profits.

I'm sure if you put an ad on localbitcoin offering a premium price you'd get enough interest.  Probably not from a single seller though...

cool.  I'm guessing there are a lot of people in his district without bank accounts who are getting raped by Western Union.

This is really stupid.  You don't need broadband to use BTC.  You can handle most of it with a phone.  There is a great opportunity here for the 8.2 percent of US households that are unbanked.  Instead of paying $10 a month for the privilege of having a bank account at Chase they can use a phone and BTC.  Even better is avoiding Western Union for foreign remittance.  The fact of the matter is the traditional system works well for the young rich people this article writes about.  BTC is an alternative to that system.

If you're treating it like an investment that implies that you'll have a strategy, targets on when to sell and how much, a purchase plan and other things.  Try to be realistic and realize that it is very volatile.  Most of us have seen our holding drop +50% at some point.  Personally I'm trying to get up to 10% of my assets in coin (right now I'm not even at 1%).  If I was younger I'd do more.

huge waste of money.  Probably more effective to have a 30 minute "get rich" infomercial running for hours and hours on every channel.  
In any case plenty of ways to get more "bang for your buck" than a Super Bowl ad.

Thanks all for the feedback!

I didn't buy that high but I bought higher than where it is now.  Doesn't bother me too much.  The fundamentals are the same and I've bought other investments that tanked for a while and then exceeded.

OK.  It didn't happen and I am lying.

You can already get Amazon gift cards via gyft.com  That's good enough for me.

The reason it crashed last time is because mtgox kept screwing up.  Now they aren't as important as they used to be.

Great idea.  Do it!!!  I don't think this approach is as bad as you make it because 1. the media is bad-mouthing bitcoin daily so time is of the essence 2. most of these joker congress people started out being fringe nut jobs.  They are exactly the type of annoying people who will attend a march for this or a rally for that.  It's in their blood!

I don't trust my brother to handle it properly so I'm holding onto it.  Eventually I'll put it in it's own wallet so he can look at the block chain and watch it.

Laminate the card.  Wear the I accept bitcoin pin.  When they want to do bitcoin just whip out the card.

Seems like an honest response.  All currency is ultimately faith-based.

My worry about brain wallets is pragmatic.  You get hit by a car, suffer trauma, can't remember your code.  Seems like a crazy risk to me.

Thanks for all the explanations!  As a buyer I do not see why I would use a service that requires me to risks twice the purchase price in order to close the transaction.  This is huge paradigm shift.  Bitcoin is already riskier for the buyer than credit cards (for example) because there is no way to dispute.  This just adds another level of risk.

Better chance with Congress than a Senator.  My guy has less than 6000 likes on Facebook.  At the very least it will have his/her email opener mark that there was a pro-bitcoin comment from a nice person who didn't sound like a lunatic.

I'm in sales.  I'm surprised every day and have no idea how anything works!
@_date: 2013-06-29 06:01:02
email them and ask them to take bitcoin.  I did and they said no.  :(
