Have you been to places like Shanghai? Their train system standards are miles above any US train systems that I've been to. Can we please refrain such bold that, let's be frank, is based on a stereotype.

My opinion is if you put only the amount that you are willing to lose in already just ride it out. You only have to gain. However don’t put more money . Why would you buy into a dip that’s still dipping? At this point you have more luck earning money at a casino.

How do you do that with your portfolio?

i don't know. over time i lost $800. and i'm one of lucky folks that didn't buy at the peak. at this point it's more economic to pay off my car loan to avoid the interest.

You are right. If I said half year that's a scary fall.

I'm not about the get-rich-quick type. But if an investment was rapidly depreciating at this rate for almost a year then it would be a bad business move to keep invested. Even money depreciates and then tell you not to save it.

Agreed but you are asking the person who has netflix on one screen and youtube on another screen.

As far as iOS. Bluetooth Low Energy battery usage is negligible. And there’s a difference between airdrop and BLE. As far as security goes, Apple is realllllly strict when it comes to BLE. So much so that becomes a blocker. For example Apple will automatically discount itself from a device if a frequency of incoming data passes a threshold, that is set kinda low tbh

If I am understanding your question correctly, are you asking if it can be a complication? 
Yeah it shows up as a little small icon. For only the small complication areas. My original plan was to make it so customizable that it updates a value in these modules however after spending a few days on it on I was unsuccessful. I found a post on stack overflow saying Apple doesn’t allow updating these icons and only the core Apple Watch apps can. But I have a hard time believing that. I think the large module areas can be updated but I still gotta put work into that :).
tl;dr: it does have a small icon that opens the Watch app.
Hopefully I answered your question correctly let me know if I didn’t.

Yeah I plan on making a video like this but yeah they take mobile payments. 
They walk around with their qr codes
Even temples take digital payments.

I’m curious. I worked a lot with BLE iOS and Android development. What are you saying the implications of just leaving on Bluetooth ?
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:48:07
Don’t worry I didn’t really know until I started working on it. 
Yeah my goal is to have that stuff update and for the app to allow you to pick what you want to show there. Some of it’s just annoying working with complications for watchOS. 
even getting the image to show for the complication is annoyingly stupid. But now things should be a little smoother.
Thanks pal!

Thanks op if we can get away from this investment talk and more into this replacement of fiat talk then people wont freak and get out of crypto once it dips. But alas people don’t care about the point of crypto they are just told to throw money into it
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:18:20
Congratulations you missed the point. The implication of the future being not for yielding profit but replacing fiats with a decentralized currency that is self regulated and transparent enough where a single power can’t control the flow of currency.
If you are in the game and treating cryptocurrencies as investments and a get rich quick scheme then you are gunna feel the pain. And your hand is gunna be weak.
Next time try not to be a jerk.
