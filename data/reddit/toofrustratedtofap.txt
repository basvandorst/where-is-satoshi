Exactly. People that haven't dealt with any of the moving parts here dont know what they are talking about. There are guys who probably could pay a new car in cash every month from their years of built rebills (obviously rare) but it a steady income for many. And if you wanna switch to bitcoin good luck on those high PPS offers because I could be wrong but i would assume bitcoin would have a much lower rebill rate.
So there is a niche market for it but tell me why the companies or affiliates themselves would do this?

Not sure what youre talking about really, do you mean in the sense for example the CC companies were not accepting USA online gambling charges to avoid legal issues?
There is really no problem with Visa/MC and porn payment that i am aware of.

It's a mix of their shady tactics, people getting their nut and then being like wait i paid for this shit why, claiming fraud when the wife sees the charge and of course good old regular fraud.

In my view unlikely. Paying for porn has been on the decline for however long and I don't think that people who would use bitcoin are any more likely than the general population to pay for porn and you would need a large number of people using bitcoin to overcome the rebill revenue.
Either way I'll believe it if Manwin implements it and not niche stuff since they control like half the market anyways of tubes/cams/porn sites.

No way is losing recurring billing and precheck cross-sales (the box a lot dont notice when they are signing up for trials or for another site...again w/ the same recurring billing) are worth way more to them than bitcoin payment options.

Yep this would seem to kill most rebills at revshare in addition to the high PPS offered since they couldnt count on X months of rebills for the site the person wanted and then the 2 prechecked cross-sales (if they did them)
Also from one of my sponsors i get a random check every couple months because i had PPS for (USA,UK,CAN,etc) traffic but it changed to revshares past those 10 or so countries. basically to end the story some dude from Luxembourg has been under me for like a year....not a huge catch or anything probably less than a grand total in a year. Some people have caught some huge whales on revshare camsites though.

No, they usually just much pay much higher merchant fee's as high risk clients because of the high fraud/chargebacks.
