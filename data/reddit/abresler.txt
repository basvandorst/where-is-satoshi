Coming from a real estate background the best article I read about btc and it's potential value used real estate an example in an Harvard Business Review article (I will find and post).  The ledger aspect is revolutionary and hypothetical could render obsolete the stupid and back dated business of title insurance which is is a tax all real property owners must pay to hedge risk of non clear title.   Technology can and should render this obsolete same goes with contracts.   Bitcoin's practical business uses are really fascinating and positive for the world economy less so for insurance companies and especially litigators which means you know it's good!)

Met Mike yesterday when he supported my wife's amazing cookie business which just started taking bitcoin in person in addition to our website (gothamcookies.com) and the best explanation to start expecially as a business owner who is already taking the currency and so happy that we made the decision to do so is that it's another currency just like a euro or a yen.  It has growing purchasing power and can immediately be exchanged into the fiat currency of your desire.  Now after that you begin to see people more interested in the currency and how it works (for example my wife the business owner and then yesterday all these people and merchants at the market we were at watching us transact without currency or a square reader) the underlying lying value of crypto currency are the details and api but really most people don't care about that yet if ever really what they care about is does the currency have buying power and is it easy to use and I have to emphatically say yes to both!!  Hope to meet more of you guys especially if you use btc to buy amazing bomb ass cookies but it's a metaphor for this question in some ways :)

@_date: 2014-08-02 00:32:52
No great feedback that is changing soon; the company just got a new logo and are redoing the website around the new logo -if you don't mind giving more feedback pm me with how you'd ideally make it better so we can potentially incorporate the feedback
@_date: 2014-08-02 04:22:12
Much appreciated they are about 2.25 ounces so at some point I hope you get a chance to try and realize they are still a good value.
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:53:32
Sure this has been posted here before but well worth a repost and a read if you haven't yet read it 
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:35:06
Believe me I will but most importantly my wife the small business owner is seeing how great this community is.  I am going Alexis Ohanian style on my bitcoin merchant evangelism fantastic community it's been amazing and just scratching the surface you can order and pay in btc online at gothamcookies.com we will also setup a btc rewards program and discount just love it

Got my wife's business using coinbase seperate from this and it worked like a charm especially on android.  For ios you had to know the work around (qr scan outside of an app payment in coinbase) which was still super easy (way easier than squarr).  Sadly doubt the vendors got good training on how to use the POS system (which seems shit compared to coinbase) and got training on the fundamentals of how the currency works still hope this is a success
@_date: 2014-08-02 00:34:12
You don't need ID just place an order
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:19:57

@_date: 2014-06-01 12:14:40
Rich pleasure amazing to have an impulse buy because of bitcoin.   Can't speak highly enough of the experience taking btc in person.  Every small business should be taking it and at some point they will.
See you again soon Rich!!
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:47:23

@_date: 2014-08-02 13:02:57
This system is terrible; hopefully this dies and there is a big fight being waged against it - we will see
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:46:20

@_date: 2014-08-02 04:26:15
I hope you try them and test your theory but one persons savings is another person's income and that income is being recycled back into bitcoin - if her vendors accepted bitcoin we'd keep much more in the currency - it's crazy but well known how much "processing fees" eat away at margins
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:04:43
Ha love that tag line may have to borrow it!!
