Guys, really glad to see [VirtualDoctors.org]( are now up and runnig with Bitcoin!
I've sent you a small donation.
I've been talking to the two principles at [VirtualDoctors.org]( and we are all in agreement that they want to try and get the Bitcoin economy kick started by buying what equipment they can find from feasible suppliers in Bitcoin. I and some of the other community members are going to help out with this.
Can anyone suggest reliable places to buy computers and digital cameras from in the UK with Bitcoin?
I'm also working on a few UK suppliers to start taking bitcoin so watch this space...

People often think they "have their money in the bank" but actually they have "loaned their money to the bank" within the implicit assumption that the bank will manage its affairs correctly and be able to pay them back.
Personally I'd rather keep my money in the blockchain. Bitcoin is the first technology to allow you to store value without relying on an intermediary party.

Do you anticipate your design will be decentralised or centralised?
@_date: 2013-05-29 11:10:17
The design of the system will be such that to transfer fiat, e.g. USD for BTC you will need to do the following steps:
1. Download and install the wallet-client.
2. Find a bid/ask that matches yours.
3. Setup an escrow and execute.
4. One party then sends bitcoins to a holding address using a 2-of-3 transaction including the selected escrow. The other party pays fiat into the bank account of the selected escrow.
5. When the escrow confirms that: A. Funds are in the longest bitcoin blockchain after the longest specified number of confirmations and B. USD have cleared into the escrow's bank account, the escrow releases access to the bitcoin address to one party and transfers the USD onto the other's bank account. (The escrow will also take fees). Else the transaction is reversed.
The crucial difference with our design is it is fully decentralised so your BTC will clear to an address you can access on the Bitcoin blockchain, rather than residing as a balance at a centralised provider. This process is true of any other cryptocurrency: it will clear to an address you can access on that respective blockchain, not a central provider.
Anyone can sign up as an escrow agent. So escrows can be either trusted individuals operating on a small scale all the way to large trusted organisations. You can choose which one you want to use based on word of mouth and how much other parties on the network you trust in turn trust those escrow. We are already communicating with one large organisation that would act as recognised and trusted escrow agents on the decentralised exchange. **If things go well** we should be able to develop the first cut of this system alongside their escrow service so the decentralised exchange can launch with a large provider up and running on the network.
To clarify further; the exchange is fully decentralised so we are not involved in the transaction. Any transaction is between you, another bidder/asker and the escrow.
Transfers between cryptocurrencies are the first step of our design and have an automated escrow process regulated by the network itself so no humans are involved and your funds cannot go missing: you either receive access to your funds if both transfers remain cleared on the longest blockchains after the longest specified number of confirmations, or the network issues each party a refund. Refunds are only issued if funds are not in the longest blockchains after the longest specified number of confirmations, i.e. someone has tried a double spend attack, did not send the funds or something is programmatically wrong with one of the cryptocurrency blockchains. This protects both parties and removes any requirement for trust from the system for crypto to crypto exchanges.
There will also need to be fees attached to all escrow services along with other actions carried out by the distributed exchange. **We will not be receiving any of these funds**. These fees are necessary to pay various entities on the system to ensure they are correctly incentivised to cooperate within the decentralised exchange.
Currently we are only showing our whitepaper to select investors and members of the cryptocurrency community in an attempt to attract investment. If we are unsuccessful in attracting sufficient interest within a few months we will release the whitepaper into the public domain.
We are hoping to get some independent comments from some select individuals who have viewed the paper shortly in an attempt to help certify that our design is feasible and our stated aims are achievable.
@_date: 2013-05-30 11:40:55
So our system rollout is two stage:
The first stage enables crypto to crypto exchange. This uses an **automated escrow** enforced by the network: when two users exchange currency the network waits the for the specified number of confirmations for each blockchain, if both lots of funds are in the longest blockchains after the longest specified number of confirmations the automated escrow provides access to the new funds to each party, if they are not it provides access back to the original funds. Thus only two parties and the decentralised exchange are involved in this transaction. These types of transactions and the bid/ask data are all logged by the decentralised exchange so can be publically viewed as graphs, charts etc.
The second stage extends the automated escrow AIP to allow fiat to be exchanged for crypto using a **3rd party escrow**. This could be a person operating from a personal bank account or a large organisation. The 3rd party escrow confirms that: A. Funds are in the longest blockchain after the specified number of confirmations and B. fiat has cleared into the 3rd party escrow's bank account, the escrow releases access to the crypto blockchain address to one party and transfers the USD onto the other party's bank account. Else a refund is provided.
This form of transaction requires three parties: bidder, asker and 3rd party escrow. The decentralised exchange offers a pool service for 3rd party escrows to sign up and make themselves available to bidders/askers in decentralised manner. This is a decentralized system so we are not in charge; we do not control who the escrows are and who signs up. Because the system is decentralised this will be managed by the community through a trust based system. All **fiat** transactions are also logged by the decentralised exchange. This means all fiat valuations, volume's traded and bid/asks along with any other information are stored in the decentralized exchange and can be can be publically viewed as graph, charts etc.
3rd party escrows and bid/askers could be selected that have fiat accounts geographically local to you. e.g. if an exchange is set up entirely within the UK most fiat accounts clear with 2 hours.
A trust based system is built into the decentralised exchange, this will be for: 
 * 3rd party escrow's, e.g. a party you know and trust trust this escrow.
 * Bidders/askers, to help identify parties that may have double spent; degrees of trust violation can vary depending on whether a transaction was double spent or an exchange failed due to errors beyond a party's control such as a blockchain programmatic error.
 * Trust will also be ascribed to specific cryptocurrencies themselves if for example they become a haven for double spending attacks and/or their blockchains prove to be programmatically unreliable.
Hope this clarifies the design a bit more.

I have restricted this thread to the UK because it's what I can manage.
I make a point of calling or emailing most of the organisations on this list personally to check they are genuine and operating. I have spoken to more than half the people on this list by telephone and most of the rest by email.
I am also walking round Brighton taking time to explain Bitcoin to individual organisations as I've found this is very effective. Generally if people don't like bitcoin its because they don't understand Bitcoin. Once you take time to go through it with them the then can't go back to fiat.
This is creating local Bitcoin communities: BitcoinStickers.co.uk has already kindly donated vinyl window stickers for me to give to shops I can convince to take Bitcoin. Another forum member in Wales just went out and signed up the King William IV pub after seeing my thread on [Bitcointalk]( 
Taking the time to set people up to use Bitcoin is generally fastest and smoothest if done face to face. That's how I found out about it and I'm sure most of you found out because a trusted person told you. So this thread is local to the UK because it's what I, the OP, can personally manage in my spare time.
I totally agree: Bitcoin is a tool of global trade. Please promote it to those local to you and encourage others to do the same as I've found this to be the most effective approach. I hope to see others starting their own threads local to them too.
So far 5 of the organisations on this list are there purely due to my input with another 5 or so in the pipe and I'm about to start a full blown round of leafleting private business owners in Brighton. With enough critical mass I hope that soon others will start to do what I am doing and the critical mass means I can step back whilst bitcoin adoption becomes pervasive.
If anyone wants to donate to cover the cost of leaflet production (for the Brighton and Sussex area only) please send funds to [MetaLair]( Thanks.
