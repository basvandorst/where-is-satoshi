Realistically, no one would be “okay” with losing any amount of money. Multi millionaires would stop to pick up change they accidentally dropped... just sayin.

I’d legitimately think the first thing you’d have learnt in business school is “past performance is no guarantee of future results.”
Regardless I agree with his sentiments.

Furthermore, with a Trezor on the way, I’m scared of the fees to transfer from the exchange, am I at the mercy of the exchange (Luno)? Should I bite the bullet and transfer to cold storage or risk storing it online?
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:24:03
You can, get Blockfolio, enable notifications, set alert. That’s what I do anyways.

Oscar Arc
Oscars Arc is a dynamic dog adoption organisation driven to inspire dog adoption and save shelters dogs’ lives through WOOF Project.
Oscars Arc takes healthy, happy and homeable dogs from existing shelters and places them at WOOF Project.
I can’t explain how many lives these guys have saved by their mobile dog adoption unit.  The animals get an enormous amount of attention and I’ve literally watched a once battered and scared dog transform into a healthy sociable dog simply by being in their care.
I can make a few calls to have bitcoin donations available on their site if you’re keen to donate.

I have btc on an exchange (I know, I know) and created some secret Santa paper wallets that I intended to deposit a small amount of btc to stir interest. It cost me 0.00048btc to send 0.00053btc. So RIP making anymore. Is there anything I can do to reduce the fee? Any and all help would be appreciated.

The heats one thing sure but getting the kit needed to mine effectively in South Africa isn’t worth it in itself. I’d suggest instead contributing to the legitimacy of bitcoin by building a node from a RaspberryPi.
You can pick one up in SA at:
Configure it using this guide:

Dude I’m in South Africa, our Luno Exchange is at $13k where gDax is at $9.5k, trust I know, it’s just the way it is.

Hard to say, doesn’t look like it’ll make it past $7500 atm, maybe get in after the fork if price does drop. It’s all opinions and speculation at this point, do what your gut tells you and never invest what you can’t afford to lose.

South African checking in... it’s all anyone ever speaks about down here.
One of our largest grocery stores PicknPay recently implemented a trial run of Bitcoin, it seems hopeful that they’ll roll it out soon too.
With political insecurity causing investors to downgrade our status, I think the interest in bitcoin is to protect assets.
Viva la Resistance.

I don’t live in either of those and I sure as hell ain’t rich. I think a lot of people confuse absurdly high crime rates perpetuated by mass poverty as “genocide” is all. When such a minority get together and echo chamber their ethnicity’s misfortunes it’s easy to understand why you’d think that. However rationally looking at murder statistics, white genocide ain’t even on the radar.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:59:54
South African reporting in and... no, whites aren’t getting killed off.
