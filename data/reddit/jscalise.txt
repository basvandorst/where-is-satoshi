Here’s the deal. Bitcoin will be nothing but hobby money or monopoly money until I can buy stuff on Amazon directly with Bitcoin and when ADP pays Bitcoin directly to my wallet.

Here’s the deal. Indians don’t accumulate and wear Bitcoin. They wear gold.
I had some Bitcoin that I wanted to use on Amazon. Transferred about $100 worth to a gyft card so I could buy stuff. After 10 days no Bitcoin on my card. WTF? Long story short my Bitcoin never made it to gyft but gyft investigated and I received my $100 in Bitcoin. 
Not a way to run a railroad or a financial enterprise.

Jeez. Intent has nothing to do with this. "Tab A into Slot B". It's science or at least mechanics. Get the Bitcoin into my account, your account, anyone's account instantly the way any financial institution does. When ADP uses Bitcoin that's when it will be a real currency. How many Bitcoins owned should not matter in what order you are in the queue. I can buy 3 shares of Amazon or 300 shares. Gets to my account at the same time.

Bitcoin is an abject failure. When it takes 4 plus days to transfer $30 worth of Bitcoin to an account, it has problems. I can transfer thousands no millions of dollars instantly by many methods but $30 in Bitcoin and 4 days and counting? Whose running this railroad? no one and that's the problem. Safe haven? I wouldn't store Monopoly money with Bitcoin.

It should not matter "how much skin I have in the game". Sure it matters how many dollars I have but that means I can't buy a Ferrari but I could buy a Mercedes. I'm no troll but I can't fix the problem. I can't fix the dollar either unless I'm The Treasury Secretary. Here's the deal. I can't buy directly with Bitcoin on Amazon. That is real.

Can't take the valid criticism? 4 days to transfer $30. I can do an E*Trade stock trade on the margin right now and have the money in my account. Let's see Bitcoin do that. It can't. Not a real currency.

I have Bitcoin. I have cash. Cash works better. Its as simple as that.

Bank to stock market and back again.

Not true. I do everything electronically. Not millions but close.

The only thing he's interested in is campaign contributions. He'll sponsor legislation as soon as those companies pony up the cash.

I have a big pile of cash ($) and no one listens to me now. At least on how the monetary system is run. I could have millions in Bitcoin and take it from me the Bitcoin people shouldn't listen to me either. (Winklevosses?)
Okay here's the extent of my intent. I want to acquire Bitcoins and I want to spend Bitcoins. Just like cash.
