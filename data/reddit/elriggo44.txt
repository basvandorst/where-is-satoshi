Enron - corrupt corporation. And it almost took down the entire us economy. 
Just the first thought I had. 
Look into the history of the East India company. That was a corrupt corporation that started and bankrolled wars in order to keep profits flowing. They sold Opium to the Chinese, (kicking off the opium wars). They also sold humans, not really in the America’s, more in India (they did get out of the slave trade in the late 1700s.)  they systematically overtaxed and drained wealth from foreign lands in the name of the crown. And they were a corporation.

Norway is capitalist with socialist programs. Democratic Socialism is the best term.
You are dead wrong on inequality. Here’s [the world GINI]( the US is twice as unequal as Norway. 
[Here is another link that actually ranks from most financially unequal to least]( Norway is near the bottom and the US is near the top. 
Also, when you factor in standard of living Norway is literally the top of the list.

That’s misleading. Top 1% in US hold more wealth by percentage than the top 1% in Norway. Which means our inequality is later. 
And in Norway they have such strong social programs that people don’t really need extra wealth. Who cares if the 10% have more if poverty barley exists? I’m not saying Norway or Sweden are a paradise, but to pretend that they aren’t working better for the average person is wrong. 
Capitalism works in moderation, unchecked it skews towards  corporate 
corruption same with socialism, except it skews towards government corruption. 
Both in moderation are perfect.

A few hundred. Anywhere from $100 to $500. They’ve stopped accepting cash deposits from anyone but the account holder. It could be $1 and they wouldn’t take it. 
Checks only. 
I can put cash money into our joint account because my name is on it. But her account is check only.
Bank of America, Citi and Wells Fargo have all adopted this policy. Which means the major banks in the us. 
It also allows the bank to “hold” that money for a day or two earning themselves a tiny amount of interest before it clears her account.

Well, my wife’s bank no longer lets me deposit cash in her account. So it’s a money transfer or a check. They say it has to do with money laundering, but it doesn’t. I’m convinced they’re trying to bounce checks. They’ve lost out on a lot of Insufficient Funds fees recently and this is their idea on how to get them back from some people. Because it still takes a week for a check to clear.
