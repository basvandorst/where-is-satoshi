Bitcoin will never, ever, replace Paypal. A Bitcoin payment is 1)anonymous 2)can't be reversed. So as you can see, Bitcoin is perfect for criminals and scammers. No paper trail is a scammers delight. Not to mention the various exploits such as double spend.
The truth is that Bitcoin isn't anything more than a "currency" used for illegal activities where anonymity is important. Sure a few legitimate businesses are accepting Bitcoin as optional payment, but these are largely publicity stunts, business owners hoping to ride the coattail of a fad in order to market their business.
I can guarantee you Bitcoin will never go mainstream for e-commerce. It just isn't practical for the regular Joe Sixpack. Sure it may seem to make sense for a computer nerd on reddit, but regular folks have no reason to stop using credit cards. And one could argue credit cards are far superior to Bitcoin for e-commerce.
I think Bitcoin will be replaced by something better and more practical in the very near future.

No they haven't. Unless your definition of our generation is a few computer nerds? 99% of people  don't even understand what Bitcoin is, or how it even works. It is still highly speculative and experimental. It is in no way comparable to Roman coins.
I'm am guessing you have invested a sizable amount into Bitcoin, yes? Well just know Bitcoin is not a sure thing, yet.  An upcoming "Black Friday" type event could wipe out Bitcoin overnight, and we still don't know what regulations will be placed on Bitcoin.
You understand your post is highly sensationalized, yes?
