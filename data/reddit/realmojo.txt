There's "fork me on github" button on the page... Not trying to hide who I am, but the group is pretty "secret".
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:09:51
Not to spread FUD, but I think this gives a fair warning:
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:38:07
perfect timing, just in time before the bang
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:44:11
All i'm saying is get off exchanges for this year, wait for things to stabilize. And I get banned for "spreading FUD". Then I hear friends who lost money on NiceHash hack, etc...
I'm not saying sell BTC buy BCH, just get the fuck offline for now.

Well, there's a group forming around this theory:
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:26:13
Would you be willing to make art promoting Bitcoin Cash? I can pay BTC if you want...

GF living in Slovenia started selling bulgarian honey for coins. B-shop.si

When is a block unexpected?

What is forever? Suppose internet dies, where are your pixels then?
Currently, 1 million bitcoins is around 1/6 of all bitcoin in circulation, so obviously that is too much to expect. But, this notion of what 1 bitcoin is might change in the future.

Use it to explain Bitcoin to your grandma, Sherlock.

The service provides actual numbers for future values, thus plotting chart is possible. We'll have to wait and see whether these numbers have any correlation to the actual outcome.

Is there a trade volume chart?

There were some guesses below 1, see here: 
Since those guesses were the only ones at the time of the screenshot, the line went to zero (and below to satisfy the extrapolation). No magic here.

Why are you selling? I need ~100 Mhash/sec of mining power for testing, ideally I would want to rent the hashing power for some fixed cost per week.

I guess because link karma is the "official" karma on Reddit, but this is just a prototype...

The reward is distributed proportionally to how much BTC each player has placed; should've put that on the site somewhere, I know.

All times are UTC; AFAICT this is the usual practice for these kinds of apps.

Maybe using this: 
@_date: 2011-07-10 14:47:22
It could be backed by, say 1000 bitcoins and it would still be a lot of backing, if you believe some of the predictions about Bitcoin future worth.
Agree about the problem with karmawhore incentive; I'd say you'll need to be at least a "one-year-club" to be eligible for the initial seed.

I think it's a great idea, more pools means more options and better overall prices. I'm not a superstar miner, but if you happen to build software on Google App Engine (practically free hosting) I am offering a hand.

Could be a temporary problem connecting to Reddit's API.
