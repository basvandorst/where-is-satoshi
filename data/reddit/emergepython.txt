[bitcoin is a fad, or a scam, or a ponzi scheme, or worse]( - James Altucher 
Bitcoin needs some new 'experts'.

Check the volume from 2013 and early 2014: 
The only ones with volume outside of Asia were MtGox, Bitstamp and BTC-e. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:07:51
MtGox was the first exchange (first mover advantage), and I believe Bitstamp and BTC-E were the only credible alternatives. 
There are many alternatives to Coinbase today, and they only process around 5% of volume. That said, I think all exchanges are suffering under the millions of new users over the last few months.

I think as 2MB as per NYA was seen as contentious. 
However, I am now recommending and using alts to transfer money, as BTC has become too expensive. 2MB (at least) is a viable stop gap for the scaling issue.

Not too long ago I was about to wipe and sell an old laptop as I hadn't used it in years. Was looking through to make sure there were no photos or anything, and then found an old Bitcoin app called 'Armory'. 
Then I remembered I transferred 1BTC to it in 2013 to test it out. Was a good day.

No it didn't? It was hovering around $25-30 before SegWit, and is now at $45.

To [quote Mark]( with regards to Peter Vessenes court case:


@_date: 2017-07-27 16:37:58
I assume it wouldn't have any bearing on that at all (although if you held these coins there, the $110m fine should probably worry you more). 
The fact is, that the MtGox Bitcoins have been traced to BTC-e's internal accounts, so there may still be a substantial amount of them that could be recovered. It's unlikely that all 300,000 BTC have moved 'out' of BTC-e. Whether or not the FBI will recover them is another issue.

There is an option for the Japanese court to pay the claimants in BTC. This would avoid the 202,000 being dumped on exchanges for fiat by the Japanese trustee.

MtGox creditor here. Myself and thousands of others would really like (Peter Vessenes) to settle this silly lawsuit and let us finally get our claim payout. It's been over 3 years now. He will just keep appealing the decisions until 2020, it seems.

Do you voice the same value judgements to people who drink coffee in the morning in order to wake up? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:31:26


Yes, and those governments have tracked the criminality here. They have discovered that BTC-e laundered MtGox stolen funds through their internal accounts. Now BTC-e are paying the price. Don't be mad at the FBI for doing their job, be mad at BTC-e for being lousy criminals. 
If a couple of guys who work for [WizSec]( in their spare time managed to trace the theft to BTC-e, I'm sure the FBI could do so. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:42:13
Should the Japanese court not allow claimants to be paid in BTC, the Trustee of the 202,000 BTC will be left with no option other than to either find an institutional buyer (currently valued at $400m, even with a discount premium, probably way too much), or to dump the 202,000 coins on exchanges. 
If this is the case, the Japanese trustee has no regard for bitcoin or the price, they are just fulfilling their legal duty by converting the assets (BTC) into JPY in order to pay claimants. 
It's therefore preferable for the bitcoin ecosystem to support a BTC withdrawal to creditors. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:40:13
Bitcoin is also classified as an asset.

The FBI redirecting a US-based domain name =/= seizing cryptocurrency private keys. 
How are you so sure the BTCe admins that *have not been arrested* somehow do not have their private keys? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:11:03
Sure, and look at the amount of hate Mark gets for his negligence.
BTC-e operators are being hero-worshipped here, for knowingly laundering hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stolen Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:52:37
You had to prove your account ownership (username/password). If you had any issues with this (if you no longer use that email address, or felt you had been hacked), you could email the Trustee and get things sorted. All claims were accepted or rejected late last year. There's more information on it here: @_date: 2017-07-26 19:22:54
Sure, I think BTC-e is dead now anyway. Even if they open up tomorrow, 90% of people will move their funds out. 
The question, is will the FBI seize the BTC-e customer funds if it can be proven that they were stolen from MtGox? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:25:59


 
It's natural for them to attempt to distance themselves from a money launderer.
Claiming that he doesn't work for BTC-e might be true, but according to [WizSec]( who have been investigating the stolen MtGox coins for several years: 


So even if he wasn't a direct employee of BTC-e, he had a relationship with them and they chose to accept hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin into their *internal storage* at a time when hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin had been stolen from MtGox customers. They can't really distance themselves from that. They had full knowledge and facilitated the laundering of stolen MtGox funds. 
As a MtGox creditor who had a lot of my money stolen/laundered by BTC-e, I feel for BTC-e customers, but I have no sympathy for BTC-e admins; they are criminals. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:40:57
Can you show me where he said they *need* drugs and alcohol to relax? 
As far as I can see, it was you who said that in an attempt to strawman. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:58:10
Yeah. Just $10/day from 2013 and you would've spent $16k... which would now be worth $244k. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:07:07
If MtGox were shut down by the FBI for knowingly facilitating the money laundering of hundreds of millions of dollars, I would be angry at the MtGox operators for doing such a thing.
It seems in this case, many people here are hero-worshipping the BTC-e operators and completely forgetting that they are the ones that jeopardised their service by laundering hundreds of millions of stolen Bitcoin through it.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:36:27
In the eyes of the law, if you unknowingly buy something that's stolen, you do not own it. Of course, this can be contested. 
As a MtGox creditor, I'm very interested to see how this will play out. If the FBI do find a stash of BTC-E Bitcoin that were stolen from us but now belong to to BTC-E customers, who has the rightful ownership? Assuming the FBI won't simply auction them off themselves. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:16:02
Probably not. We lost a similar amount in total over at though. I don't think any of us have killed ourselves. 
At least you know of the people to 'hate'. Several years on, we still don't really know who actually stole our money. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:04:12


You do realise that BTC-e are a centralised authority? They would decide the rules to which you can and cannot use their service. They would close people's accounts that they felt fell foul of their self-imposed rules. 
Having your coins on a centralised exchange brings the risk of them being hacked, stolen, deleted or confiscated. I thought everyone knew that by now.

@_date: 2017-07-31 15:05:15
Yes, check the [blockchain analysis by WizSec]( they have been working on the stolen MtGox bitcoins for several years. They have analysed the transactions and discovered that they ended up in the internal BTC-e accounts (not simply customer deposits). 
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:13:25
Sure, if you consider bitcoin to be nothing more than a currency. 
Many people consider Bitcoin a commodity. If your gold bars are stolen, you can reclaim them back, no matter what the thief does with them. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:56:22
MtGox had a small amount go into their customer deposits. 
BTC-e had hundreds of thousands of stolen bitcoins go straight to their internal accounts, not customer deposits. There's a big difference. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:25:43
MtGox going offline was big news in the mainstream media, who reported it as [unusual activity]( at first. Later, it become known that the funds were [stolen]( 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:21:52
From the WizSec report, it looks like the stolen MtGox bitcoin went straight into the BTCe fund account (not simply a user deposit account). This would suggest that at the very least, BTCe had full knowledge, but most likely had involvement. 
This is all LE would need to seize the funds. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:23:14
I've not seen any evidence to suggest that the FBI hold BTCe's cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:34:36
Pretty sure it had a lot of Russian involvement though, as the AB resolution process mentioned that a Russian-speaking operative would mediate between parties. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:48:51
Hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin suddenly arrive into their 'internal' system from a random guy at a time when hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin were stolen from MtGox customers, which was a mainstream media story. How do you explain that? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:12:22


Except you glossed over the part where the Russian exchange [facilitated the laundering of hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin]( that were stolen from MtGox customers. 
These funds went into the *internal BTC-e accounts*, not customer deposit addresses. They then host their servers in US jurisdiction and use a US DNS. Honestly, what did they expect to happen? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:47:26
What makes you so sure it's the FBI and not one of the BTCe admins, or anyone else? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:08:28
Pretty sure most people had only tens of thousands, so hiring a lawyer would not be ideal.

So is USD. It doesn't mean Japanese companies are automatically granted the right to pay out creditors in USD. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:25:05
Yes, this is how it works in the real world. Imagine your bike is stolen, and you see someone else riding around on it. If they bought it from the thief, you are entitled to it back. The purchase contract was invalid as the thief did not posses the rights to sell the bike in the first place, which is a prerequisite in contract law. The buyer is therefore entitled to take action against the thief. 
How does that apply when it comes to the theft and subsequent money laundering of a pseudo-anonymous cryptocurrency from a Japanese-based exchange involving 27,000 international claimants over the period of several years facilitated by a shady Russian cryptocurrency exchange? Fuck knows. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:04:24
He was released a while ago. He's much slimmer now. He regularly posts in - as he's actually trying to help us creditors receive our MtGox claim in bitcoin. Otherwise, the 202,000 BTC will need to be sold, as the Japanese court will need to payout in JPY.

It's the way the blockchain investigator in the video said "the destination of those coins is definitely known", as if they are in one sitting in one wallet address. 
That said, as a MtGox creditor (who has therefore paid for the blockchain investigator), I'm wondering why this has not been stated in any of the 7 creditor meetings with the Trustee over the last few years. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:58:37
Still, as a MtGox creditor, this is news to me. It's been 3 years and there have been 7 creditor meetings in Japan. They have never told us that they know the destination address of our stolen funds. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:30:23
As I said, this is news to us creditors. We've never been told that they've managed to successfully track the stolen assets, let alone that they know of the 'destination'.
