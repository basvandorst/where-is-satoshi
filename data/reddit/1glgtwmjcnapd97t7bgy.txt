Buying millions worth of bitcoin causes supply to decrease, driving up the price of the bitcoin.  
Then they sell those bitcoins at the inflated price, and supply swells, driving down the price of the bitcoin.  This effect is amplified by people panic selling too, so the price of bitcoin will drop further.
Buy some more millions worth of bitcoins at this new lowered price, and repeat.
If you can't handle a 30%-50% swing in the price of a risky investment like bitcoin, without panic selling, you have too much money in that investment.

Nobody here cares about short-term crashes if it's going to be profitable in the long-term.

Seems like you're the delusional one here.
If you paid for it **in USD**, why on earth would you take how much **in bitcoin** it costs when you calculate earnings...

But was it likely a keylogger was used in this case?  There doesn't seem to be any evidence that any of the computers were physically compromised.
Maybe I'm assuming too much, but it seems like someone just gained access to the filesystem in this case, since it's all being done remotely?  
Also, wouldn't keylogging be useless unless they had access to the encrypted wallet.dat file anyways?

Idk why you're being downvoted.  
Keeping your bitcoins on a pirated copy of Windows is **asking** for your money to get stolen.
At the very least, immediately transfer at least &gt;90% to a paper wallet, and never use the same paper wallet twice when you need to spend any.

Just look at this loser's post history. He's been talking shit about bitcoin since 7 months ago, when bitcoins were literally $100 each. 
He stopped for 6 months and started his nonsense back up two weeks ago, as bitcoin prices were skyrocketing.  Dude's jimmies are rustling at full throttle right now, so I'm just gonna go ahead and assume this retard short sold 20btc when it was like $220.

Well maybe you should explain instead just initiating ad hominem attacks.
This is how it works in every major stock market in the world. Please explain why this particular commodity doesn't follow supply and demand?

Just like the Earth will eventually fall back into the Sun.  
I think I have some time before I have worry about that though...

I don't see why unencrypted wallets are even an option..
No seriously, why on earth would you leave your wallet unencrypted?

If the U.S. government actually has the power to do this, why aren't more people worried about it?
It seems like they could cripple bitcoin for years if they tried, right?

Starting with a few bucks is by definition 'not too much money.'  I'm talking about the people considering dumping half their 401k into bitcoin.  And then they start panic selling when bitcoin drops 15%.
Also, if it's most of your net worth right now, it might be wise to reallocate some of it into safer funds.  Depends how bullish you're feeling, and since you didn't sink your savings into it, a case for either way can be made.

Clearly the bitcoin market is as predictable as gravity.

Banks can protect **a lot** of your dollars because they are backed by the government.  Banks cannot protect infinite amounts of cash.
There is no reason why bitcoin bank accounts can't offer private insurance up to a certain BTC value.
