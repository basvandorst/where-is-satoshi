I am aware of that, given the scale from the beginning of Bitcoin to now. I'm looking forward to that long term hold, it's an investment for me, something I could afford to lose if it goes that route. 
Thank you.

Thank you. I'll start off small just to put my feet in the water, but I will end up getting a whole Bitcoin instead of just a fraction. 
With that said, what's the biggest small amount?
What amount would be big enough that I would have to do something else?

Thank you, Thank you.
I'll have an account before the end of the day.

I am now calm, 6 hours ago I wasn't 
I'm well aware that the bitcoin market is very volatile and I'm buying high right now. The next step is to get a bitcoin address. Thank you.

Oh, I've got a clue, no-expert that's for sure. For me this is a long term thing. I see Bitcoin exploding in the future, with that said, I know there's a good amount of risk and I won't be investing anything I can't afford to lose. I won't be doing anything illegal or anything of the sort, so I have no problem using personal information. 
Thank you for your input.

Great information. Thank you for your response, it is greatly appreciated.
