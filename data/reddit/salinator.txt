How? Is it required that a man of the same name must be aware of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:55:14
Assuming you read newspapers. Assuming you have heard of Bitcoin (this might surprise you, but not everybody has. Especially not the older generation).
Assuming that because his name was *somewhat* publicized he had to have heard of Bitcoin is fallacious.

You're straw manning, and projecting. A remarkable feat, especially considering your entrenched viewpoint that your misunderstandings ought to be taken seriously and that its the fault of others for not lending credence to said misunderstandings.

Much wit. So creating.

Please. Show me proof of serious death threats. This is classic victim mentality. Hole up and make the world pity you for just doing your darnedest. She ruined a guys life in the short term. She has already shown willing to be the type to say anything for attention. I don't buy it.

If ruined his life doesn't suit you, how about falsely and voyeuristically thrown into the public eye to the detriment of his current circumstances. Whatever you want. One of these people wants more attention, one of these wants less. Which one are you going to believe in that instance?

I love edgy comments like this.  You tell em!
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:54:30
Redditor for one day. Only comments are strongly anti-bitcoin.
Make it more obvious why don't you?
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:13:08
That's a ridiculous blanket statement that is simply not true in all instances. Your insistence on lumping people as being either pro or against the state is reductive and flat out unhelpful.
The world is not separated into two groups, you and them. The sooner you grow up and realize nuance exists the better off you will be.

Please stop acting like the system is perfect. It is embarrassing.
@_date: 2015-03-27 23:31:28
How do you not realize that bitcoin is exactly what they are talking about here?
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:46:53
I think you have it backwards.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:37:32
You're so on to me.
Oh wait, that wasn't the case at all. It was just an unnecessary and shitty point to try and make.

Jesus. You had a great point, and then you go on to fuck it up by pretending that libertarians are the only ones capable of being blinded by ideology which, in and of itself, is you being blindy stuck to your ideology.
People on any position on the political spectrum can do just the same, you just couldn't resist an opportunity to shit on people whose philosophy differs from yours, and that makes you a sad, sad soul.
