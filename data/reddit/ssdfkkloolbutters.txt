Please read the letter. What cartels were these kids / young adults going to contact? They were on SR because they had no local access to cartels nor their drugs.
He also claims being rich wasn't his motivation. He still doesn't own up to it in his own letter to the judge. He instead claims he wasn't in need of money -- well yeah, no one really *needs* 100s of millions of dollars but people go to great lengths to acquire it anyway. It paints the picture of a disingenuous liar.

You could be de-anonymized and/or victimized via remote exploit and/or via (D)DoS. Implications vary.
If I were someone very public about being an early adopter, for example, and had a BCT account and didn't use Tor/VPN I would be concerned someone could use the information to track down my physical location and perform rubber-hose cryptanalysis for my private keys.

Sure, makes sense. Are you ok with your local supermarket being the first to sell heroin and guns?

So you didn't read the letter did you? Try giving it a quick read and see if you can count how many lives were demonstrably ruined (i.e. ended) by drugs sold via SR and then come back and have more pity for this greedy liar. Ross' goal was to become filthy rich and retire. People dying was an inconvenience to that end.

Please stop mashing keys and read the letter.

Buying drugs **they didn't have local access to** so in all likelihood they'd still be alive if SR didn't exist? Did you just not read the letter either?

They should know that along with body parts they are also exposing their IP address. Really all demoers offering streamium streams should be aware of this. It could be very dangerous.

Excellent point?

Sure, lets ignore the immediate and easily quantifiable and documented loses for the unknown and not-ever-possible-to-substantiate theoretical people who owe their lives to this greedy liar douche bag. Not struggling in the slightest.
