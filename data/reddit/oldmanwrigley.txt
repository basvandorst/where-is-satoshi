But either way, this was just a quote from the article that post that was linked. I think he's basically saying that the total value of Bitcoin could be equal to the total value of wealth in the world, basically if every single thing was sold, all debts settled, and all the money was put into a (very big) jar, that dollar amount would be the market cap of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:57:28
This is correct. 
I'm confused how it ties in with the quote though?

Also, we see, let's round up to 5 threads per day negative about Coinbase, when they've got tens of millions of users.... I'm pretty sure that most people have no issues with Coinbase, like myself, and I've been using them exclusively since June.

 &gt; As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and
becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the
total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all
the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.

I think you may want to do a bit more research and reading on bitcoin. You can buy $10 worth of bitcoin. The value is “too high” when it surpasses $1M and that is just going to be due to the smallest piece you can buy costing $1. 
I can go on Newegg right now and buy any product they have to offer, doesn’t matter if it’s $5 or $10,000, I can use BTC to make my purchase. I mean I don’t have nearly that much, but you get what I’m saying. Anybody can invest. I bought $20 this morning at $15k and that $20 is now worth almost $23. 
You can get a card to connect to coinbase and use your BTC balance to make every day purchases anywhere visa is accepted. The value can literally go to the moon and still be extremely valuable and versatile. 
If you don’t think about your “return” in dollar values and more of a percentage, it sheds new light. Yeah I put in $20 and made $3. Big deal. But the point is I made a 15% return on investment in 12 hours. That’s absurd.

They all say don't store your money on Coinbase. You're vulnerable to attacks, you don't own your keys, etc. Coinbase does have a nice vault feature that requites 3 different forms of conformations to withdraw plus a 48 hour waiting period where you can cancel the withdrawal. It's not terrible. 
HOWEVER, once you have a decent amount of money, we do suggest you move your coin to a wallet, such as BreadWallet (iOS) or something similar. 
That site has a fantastic list of wallets that are available, it's also a trusted site (see sidebar)

I'm not sure how it works in Canada, as far as I know Coinbase isn't in Canada^yet, but with Coinbase you sell your BTC and instantly get whatever the current price is, minus a fee. I'm 99% sure it's the same way on GDAX

Yeah the gameboy quite the gaming console. What the fuck else can you do? It’s bitcoin. The only option is to buy it, sell it, or trade it. By you saying “too” indicates you’re a teenager, which isn’t surprising. My age has nothing to do with any argument I’m making. For bitcoin to succeed, and replace fiat, it needs exposure, it needs buyers, and it needs sellers. Plain and simple. I’m doing my part, just like most everyone else on this sub. 
I hope you keep this account and when you hit your early to mid 20’s look back on your post history and realize what an immature dumbass you sounded like

@_date: 2017-12-07 05:47:07
I don’t like the idea of it. Last Thursday (Wednesday?) BTC “crashes” down nearly 30% but within a very short amount of time recovered and is now up nearly 50% since then. If you had a stop loss at $9k, you’d be kicking yourself in the face

I’m not sure what you’re saying. When you deposit funds, it takes about 7 days for your money to show up I Coinbase. Coinbase tells you this. Everywhere. 
The money will pull out of your bank account and it still may be a few days before it’s reflected on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:08:45
Easiest bet is send them to your Coinbase wallet and withdraw from there to your bank account. You’ll have to worry about verification though and most likely will take a minute to withdraw ~$30k to USD. 
Or you could just HODL

You may be right, it may not be "safe", but it's definitely a good investment. I got in at $3k. Family members got in at $10k. The results speak for themselves. With BTC hitting ATH's almost every week, there literally is basically nobody losing money.....
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:45:41
They "launched" buying/selling when they shouldn't have. According to Coinbase, the price of bcash went up a million percent from $3k to $8,500 (or $9,500 on GDAX), but everything was locked. There were upwards of 15,000 bch for sale, and all sell orders got wiped. 
Also, quite obviously insider trading, there's no way this was just one giant coincidence (of course, this is just my opinion). 
Quite obviously it seems like Coinbase is in bed with Roger. Coinbase announced they would enable transfer of bch in January. They never publicly made a statement on a date or if it would be available to buy/sell. But still, bcash went up like 40% today (so many people buying it) before going to the moon when it was released on Coinbase. Coincidence? Maybe... but it seems pretty obvious it was not. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:35:40
Price went from $19,400 to right at $15,000 in literally 10 minutes earlier today. It's been one hell of a year this past week. Relax, HODL, and have faith in BTC

Man you really are dense. Now I see why nobody else took the time or effort to respond to you. It’s what bitcoin represents. I may only have a fraction of a bitcoin, but it represents, in fiat, enough to say, pay my rent. I’m not going to convert to USD to pay rent, the goal and hope is one day I can just transfer BTC to my leasing office to pay the rent. I don’t give a shit how much “USD” it’s worth, I just care that because it’s growing and becoming huge instead of buying a gameboy with my $100 USD two months ago now I can buy a PS4 with BTC off Newegg
I’m doing just what everyone else is doing. Buying bitcoin, purchasing stuff with bitcoin when I can and accepting bitcoin for anything I’m selling.

Literally if you google "what merchant accepts bitcoin" this is the first result. 
"how to cashout bitcoin" also leads you to step by step even on google on how to buy/sell bitcoin using the most popular exchange, Coinbase.com.
Also, the sidebar is full of useful information. $10k is such a big deal because a lot of people on this subreddit bought bitcoin when it was very cheap, 10 to even 50% of it's current value (just 3 weeks ago it was around $5,500), and are now out buying Teslas and Lambos

@_date: 2017-11-27 06:18:16
I mean we definitely missed the early days, where even a year ago the $600 I bought could have basically purchased a whole bitcoin, and now $10k wouldn't be life changing but still be monumental to me. Like the guy said, if you only have $100 to spare, you're clearly not rich, and doubling your money in a couple months is still the nuts. 
I look at it very optimistically, Bitcoin could shoot up to $100k, and my little $600 investment (now $700) could be worth $15,000. That's enough to pay off student loans and get out of debt. 
I know I'd get crucified on this sub, but yesterday I also bought $50 worth of Ethereum and one whole Litecoin at $84.85, because while I don't think those coins will ever be what Bitcoin is, I think there's a chance they could produce some very solid returns. 
Yeah, we missed out on lambos and Teslas, but I think in a couple years will be when people REALLY have missed out and don't stand a chance at doubling their money in anywhere near the time that we can now in the present day.

For a $1k “investment” to turn into $400k, well if that was me, I’d be feeling pretty rich. I guess “being rich” is subjective. If I had $1000 investment from 5 years ago sell today for $400k I’d consider myself rich af
