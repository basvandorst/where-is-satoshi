[Sure did. ](

It is? Why?
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:16:14
I didn't. I'm not holding any crypto currency. I follow the subreddit though, so I know what HODL means and was amused when I saw it written there.
**Edit:** *I just realized that my wording might be interpreted as I'm trading, but not holding. I do neither. Just to clarify.*       
I saw this graffiti after my lecture this morning and decided to snap a picture because I thought you guys might like it. I know I can't really prove that I didn't write it myself. You have to take my word for it.
**Edit 2:** since I said it so many times and this might be a comment most people see:
I agree that it is probably written by one person. No, that person wasn't me. My guess is that someone might have noted down the investments or crypto loyalties in their friends group. Or it's just someone pretending.    
If you want to check for yourself, it's at the University Koblenz-Landau, Campus Koblenz, in room M001 3rd row from the bottom right next to the window, iirc.   
If you're actually there you can send me a text and check my hand writing. I don't vandalise desks.

I thought about investing like 50€, but I found the hardest part actually getting my money onto the crypto markets. I read up quite a lot on how crypto currencies work, found it fascinating and wanted to invest into the technology.
What turned me away was how complicated turning my € into any crypto currency in the first place. Maybe I haven't found the right guide yet, but trading seemed overly complicated for me back then. There's also the turn off that there are constant news of scams seemingly everywhere. There's like a really popular platform and people praise it for being user friendly - bam! Half a year later the creators steal half a million in crypto currencies and disappear.
I wasn't too invested in the first place, more curious than anything, but with everything else going on in my life it seemed too much of a hassle to get into.

Oh, thanks for the link! Love to learn these origin stories. =)
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:44:15
HODL is a crypto term and written incorrectly on purpose I think.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:37:59
Be nice. You don't know me.
@_date: 2019-04-26 21:55:41
I think it's ETH.

I mean, we have a lot of exchange students, but most of the younger generation in Germany speak English quite well. Especially at university I'm guessing the rate goes up.
[I uploaded another pic here]( You can check for yourself if you ever come to Koblenz. At the University, not Hochschule, room M001, 3rd row from the bottom, next to the window.
@_date: 2019-04-26 21:57:02
Yeah, I thought the same thing. Or maybe a friend's group where one person noted it down?
I also thought it might be one person writing down their portfolio, but no student has enough money to hold 5 whole bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:50:24
I think it was written down by one person. Maybe writing for a group of friends. I just thought it was amusing because of the crypto reference.
@_date: 2019-04-26 21:49:48
Is 16 yo 16 year olds? I feel like I'm missing a joke here.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:52:23
Koblenz, actually. =)
I'm guessing they all order the same desks.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:47:56
I answered a few times already that I agree it was probably written by one person. Maybe he/she took notes from a group of friends? Or it's just one person pretending to be multiple people. I took the picture because of the crypto reference and didn't think about it too much until later.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:17:30
Yeah, I'm guessing the same person wrote all of it down, too. Can't really prove that it wasn't me. I found it after a lecture this morning and snapped a picture because I thought you guys might get a kick out of it.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:18:43
If you zoom in you can see that it's actually ETH. The marking of the wood makes the H look like an N.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:14:03
I'm guessing so as well. I thought maybe a group of friends gathering votes. Or someone pretending to be more than one.
