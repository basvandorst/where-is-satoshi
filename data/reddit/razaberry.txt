If you still wanna know:

How is it bullshit?
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:56:06
I have my keys. How many times do I have to repeat that that is not the issue at hand????
Look at r/ledgerwallet. You’ll find a ton of unresolved posts on this.
@_date: 2019-07-06 11:13:34
You misunderstand multiple aspects of this post but the main one is the reason for it. 
Cutting edge software glitches. Computers don’t always do what they’re supposed to. Everyone knows this. 
But ledger has known of this issue for 5 months. There’s 0 evidence of them helping and a ton of users feeing abandoned. 
This. This is my gripe.

Where can I get a open source hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-06 03:41:51
What about when we wanna access our funds tho? Create a new encrypted paper wallet every time? 
Idk this good for cold storage but crypto isn’t meant for cold storage.
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:00:15
Can’t reset the ledger, it either gets stuck on MCU not authentic or boot loader
Link me to one single example where I ever said I can’t access my seed.

Ahaha hey, why thank you :)
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:08:59
Hey Mike, what makes you a better choice than Bitpay?
They're more established and well known, which puts you at a slight disadvantage. Do you do something that would make me choose you over them?
@_date: 2014-11-05 11:11:31
Ah, so I did have a wallet. With 0.00 BTC ;P
Well, no gold found, no gold lost. A do get 6.6 gb more space on my comp though :)
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:04:37
Good stuff. Seeing as the staff's tech knowledge is extremely rudamentary, Bitpay looks like a good idea for the cafe.
@_date: 2014-11-05 12:15:50
I uploaded it to Blockchain.info. Was at 0.00. Good enough check?
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:06:56
Beautiful for online ecommerce shops (of which I own one, so booyeah ;).
For a cafe, however, there's still the problem of identifying which person in the cafe ordered what (what with Bitcoin wallet's pseudonymous nature).

Join the Bitcoins in Bali facebook group, and meet all the BTC entrepreneurs in town.
Also, check out CoinMapp to see all the brick and morter spots that accept BTC

Fiat means that it is issued by a government. I think.

There are quite a few charities for locals who need help. Like

Alas, doesn't work for Asia. Still, awesome set up.

Beautiful! How did I not know this app existed before. Will definitely be using for my consulting payments at the least.
@_date: 2014-05-19 04:43:12
On it.
@_date: 2014-07-25 08:32:44
Woot! See you here.

Well that's wonderfully terrifying.

How many Bitcoin core devs work for one corporation?
That should be on your checklist.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:22:16
Mate, the original bitcoin Whitepaper said that it’s supposed to be digital cash. 
Now the devs claim it’s a “store of value”. 
Who’s lying &amp; being scammy now?
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:20:39
Mate. 1 corporation running a blockchain is a centralized blockchain. There’s no argument to that.
@_date: 2019-10-11 21:33:16
Yeah. 
I guess we’ll have to agree to disagree and see who turns out correct. 
But I think the more versatile tech &amp; bigger startup community has the better edge.
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:52:06
Full node \= dev. 
Centralized dev corp makes a change you don’t like and that’s it for you and bitcoin. Fork or accept or sell are your choices then. 
The tech matters, and Bitcoin’s tech is weak compared to other blockchains like Etheruem. 
The centralization matters, and with all the devs on one payroll Bitcoin is arguably even more centralized than EOS.
@_date: 2019-10-09 04:28:19
Fully centralized, no. 
Keep in mind the DAO hack lead to a fork in Ethereum specifically because the choice to undo it was a distributed one and some did not agree. 
It was a community choice to undo the DAO hack. 
Not disagreeing that code isn’t law because of this (I was even on the ETH Classic side for a hot second because of this) but Ethereum isn’t centralized in any sense. Unarguably it’s far from “fully centralized”.
@_date: 2019-10-10 18:51:20
@_date: 2019-04-14 17:30:46
Of course there’s already a fork called SBTC. Of course. We’ve probably covered the whole alphabet by now.
@_date: 2016-10-31 14:01:19
Good point. I didn't consider this.
@_date: 2016-10-12 09:48:55
Do you know about DownForEveryoneOrJustMe.com? It checks if a website is down globally. 
It's reporting that blockchain.info is down.
@_date: 2016-10-12 09:45:08
I'm getting that it's down.
@_date: 2015-03-10 08:06:25
A few factors.
1) Transfer was from Singapore to Canada
2) The bank asked for too little information the first time, and took about two weeks to let us know the transfer failed
@_date: 2016-10-31 13:55:43
When I go to my Wallets part of the menu, I only see 5 (BTC, ETH, DAO, DASH, ETC)
@_date: 2015-03-10 07:52:14
A touch more. 69 days.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:58:14
I'm in. Here's what I've got to offer:
- A crash course on copywriting (selling with words) via ebook format (it's pay-what-you-choose, and bitcoins is an option)
- Seeing as I'm a professional copywriter and Growth Hacker, I could also sell content reviews of what other's have written. I take a look at what you wrote, send you back a video of my thoughts and advice and critique, and you pay me some BTC if my advice is useful.
- I also freelance growth hack and copywrite for BTC...but my schedule is pretty packed so this may not be a major part.
- RadNomad (soon), a minimalist nomad gear store where we find only the very best gear from the only very best nomads and let you know about it. Some gear will be payable via bitcoins (more as I set up more dropshipping deals and move away from Amazon)
- BookKritters (soon), an exclusive community where artistic authors and skilled book freelancers can find each other, based on their passions and cool-to-work-with scores as well as the usual skills and costs, to create the kinds of books that readers fall in love with.
- SurfStoked (in Private Beta), a surfer/snowboarder/mountainbiker/etc. app set that that you can use to set get your adventure crew together for a session, collect cool pics of their sessions, and share their session's memories on Facebook, all with just a few clicks (no texting back and forth on whatsapp and facebook, no organizing everyone's pics by sending them to one busy 'curator', the app makes it all fast and easy...and looks awesome.)
Tao, what say you...got any thoughts on how I can best contribute?
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:59:56
Right, I'm booking my flight ;)

Damn James, these beans mixed with grass fed New Zealand butter and virgin olive oil make - mind blowing - Bullet Proof Coffee.
Congratz on the article. Coffee loving nomads need to hear about this.
@_date: 2013-10-09 15:49:47
LMAO whoops xP. 
I wonder what olive oil would taste like. Hell, butter works with your beans...perhaps olives too?
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:05:13
I get paid in bitcoin!!!
