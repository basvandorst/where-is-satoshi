Really? You don't think the odds of satoshi's coins being gone increases if we go another 9 years without them moving? I would disagree with you there, but it is just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:21:48
But the difference is somebody going out and forking bitcoin doesn't create a coin that is fungible with something I already own, like creating more ripples does. The world is free to ignore such forks (like it's ignoring the latest in BTG while BTC moves forward), not so with supply inflation from whatever entity (or small collective) controls a coin like XRP, which is a big problem.

If they want to confirm their own tx instead of from the pool, they'll just miss out on those fees, which are of course, non-trivial at this point. Opportunity cost is part of the cost of such an attack, one very real reason having significant tx fees add to security.

Btc rocketing leads to more users, and more BTC use, which will both contribute to transaction pressure, for sure. No reason to think LNs benefits will completely outweigh those, blocks will still absolutely be full.

He has Billions of dollars now worth of BTC if he's around and has all his keys.

@_date: 2018-01-04 03:04:26
Yes, the entire lot of most of these non-POW coins were pre-mined, because they had to start from somewhere! But the basis from which something can credibly claim to have a shot at becoming a world currency depends significantly on the means by which it is distributed. PoW Mining may be energy intensive, but it's also the means by which you can distribute a coin fairly across an entire marketplace.
Also, for NEM and it's permissioned blockchain, it's enough for me to understand the "Proof of Importance" algo which will create the goofiest, most perverse incentives to try to actually run a network on to know I'm not interested.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:35:10
Centralized mining is unfortunate (for the time being) but not the same as centralized control. Miners in BTC don't dictate the rules of the network, they just accept rewards from the network to make it very difficult to attack. One of the biggest reasons BTC has fought to avoid aggressively increasing the block size is so that nodes can continue to be self reliant and NOT dependent on miners to validate rules of the network, which also means they could get together and cut out miners with a PoW change/adjustment if they ever became nefarious (which they haven't).
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:12:21
Also true, it's only a matter of when. I'd be in favor of setting a target date for activation of one ~ a year out if we want to actually maintain a competitive use case for daily transactions and high user count, but if the community decided to prioritize security and decentralization above all else and keep it small, I don't think that would be the end of BTC either, it would just mean a better value proposition for some alts.
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:40:35
No, not destroyed. a 51% attacker couldn't destroy the chain, or steal anyone's coins, only slow down/halt new progress on the network, or double-spend their own coins. There are ways to mitigate an attack in the event one started to last for any extended period of time. If you're worried about such a possibility, I strongly recommend reading up through the basics on bitcoin.org, the links in the sidebar, or links like [this one.](

This seems like a great discussion to work out in some more detail in light of recent attention, though it has been discussed in great detail before. 
I would first suggest that BTC itself has been designed with the specific intent of being resilient to being directly shut down. No 'doors to kick down' so to speak, incredibly redundant by design, with validation and even mining being relatively lightweight activities. It doesn't sound like that's your contention though.
I would next suggest that bitcoin being made illegal in any one jurisdiction makes it more attractive  to be embraced in other jurisdictions, if it actually retains useful monetary properties. Just the US or just China cracking down on ownership/usage might shutter the larger 'regulated' institutions like exchanges in that region and deter some of those citizens, but it presents a larger opportunity for other regions in that (if cryptocurrency is eventually successful \*somewhere\*) the first to embrace it gains an advantage. 
The US wants to retain the USD as the global reserve currency, other powerful countries would like to see the world pushed off of it. Embracing, regulating, and being one of the first buying into it might be safer/easier, even for those 'the man' institutions, than trying to kill it locally only to sit out the party if other places don't do the same.

I'm not sure what you mean by "held hostage." There was a coin that amped up it's inflation by dropping it's difficulty massively that would attract 20-40% of bitcoin miners for a few days at a time, but the bitcoin network has never ceased running / been a hostage of anyone. Eventually that pattern stopped because it was unsustainable, and we've had normalcy since.

Because when we export goods, we’re selling them to people who aren’t holding dollars, they’re holding their local currency. When they want to buy a product from a US company, they effectively buy dollars to cover the bill. 
If those dollars devalue relative to their local currency, all other things equal, they can buy the same things they could before using less of their local currency.

I think you need to put some actual math to your assumptions here. In a world where the energy cost to mine on a phone yields more profit than the cost o that energy, there would promptly be a large influx of new dedicated, hardwired mining ASICS to capture that profit and drive up the difficulty such that mining on your phone with charge from your wall is no longer profitable. Let alone the cost of miniaturizing such hardware into a form factor you carry around with you everywhere. 
It is today 'possible' to mine BTC on your phone, but it will never, ever be profitable, regardless of where technology goes. (Full nodes are a very different story).

I guess what I mean is, it will always be cheaper, even if the hardware was free, to use the money one would have used to pay for the extra electricity used in the mobile device to do mining, and either keep it or pay it to whoever would have benefited from the mining instead. Always. 
What is the scenario you're thinking of?
@_date: 2019-07-04 05:55:45
An excellent question! 
The short answer is that prices are sticky, and don't adjust in the same way that market exchange rates for things like currency do. Wages of GE's workers, for example, \*do not\* rise automatically as inflation does. It's supply chain is largely US based for other inputs than labor (like Steel, electricity, transportation/warehousing), those prices also don't adjust automatically in nominal terms in USD, since \*their\* inputs haven't gotten more expensive in nominal terms.
Forex exchange rates on the other hand, are very responsive to supply/demand changes. As actions (or even just the belief of likely future actions) happen, spot rates respond quickly, and certainly well ahead of price adjustments. That's why your Japanese company could indeed experience stronger purchasing power if the USD were in the process of devaluing with respect to the Yen, even if in the long term, that benefit fades.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:44:00

Computing power to validate transactions and computing power to mine blocks are completely independent quantities and variables from each other, I'm not sure why you're trying to compare them.


Non mining nodes don't secure the network from outside attackers, like miners do in creating the large capital barrier to interfering with Bitcoin. But they DO allow users to protect themselves from the rest of the network, miners and other users included. A decentralized full node base prevents just a few miners from banding together and changing the concensus rules through a hardfork, which would be a problem if the entire userbase ran on SPV. That *is* a security concern, and it *is* what a network with a robust collection of non-mining nodes prevents. 
How robust does that need to be? Thats an important question up for debate, and I'd probably agree BTC is being too conservative.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:49:42

The important thing to remember is that other countries are tired of USD as the reserve currency, and any effort to ban crypto in a place like the US effectively just gives over the tech and it's many advantages to the rest of the world until potentially they're FORCED to start allowing it for international trade. It presents a big risk, but also a big opportunity. Only a big simultaneous ban across many countries that also succeeds in turning popular opinion against it would knock it that far down.

Some are indeed, and most if not all alts are less concerned with being “uncensorable money” than bitcoin is. I think that path has some value - be big, take up resources, be prepared to host in data centers for tx processing or wherever else, be public and unconcerned with being regulated or completely “trustless”, and in exchange drive for high scale, low cost more easily. That’s just not a tradeoff the team behind bitcoin has been interested in making from the beginning, and isn’t likely to change now.

Doing this instead of creating their own ICO or token that needs to be bought with BTC like Mastercoin/Counterpary seems like a GREAT idea to me. 2-way pegs makes RSK an extension of Bitcoin that enhances the value of the base coin. I'd happily pay 20% of tx fees on RSK to the developers for such an arrangement, especially since it drives competition from competing chains/services to be introduced in the same way.

That depends on how frequently one needs to open/close channels, which is dependent on how widespread use of the network becomes. Once my salary, my electric bill, my rent, my groceries and gas are all part of LN, I might not need to open/close more than once or twice a year, if that. But that is a LONG road ahead, tx fees may still be very relevant leading up to that point.

You’re talking about capacity, more tx for more resources. He’s talking about scaling, more tx for the *same* resources. I see the two concepts get used interchangeably, when they shouldn’t be. 
Bitcoin’s capacity is lower than other alts because by design we’ve opted to limit resource usage to protect it’s ability to stay extremely decentralized and as a result, more secure, and to drive pressure for scaling solutions first. 
That being said, have we been to conservative in restraining capacity? Maybe, i’ll entertain that idea for sure, just as long as we can get on the same page for why we are where we are today.

Where are the 1000's of tps live on any other coin? There is a lot of discussion about the theoretical capacity of other coins, but until that gets realized *without* any major tradeoffs of network functioning/security in practice, it's just a marketing gimick.
Empty chains can afford to have extremely low fees. Tech like Iota requires a centralized coordinator to avoid having tx double spent or ddos'ed, and as recent activity shows sometimes that doesn't work either. What tech works at high throughput in the longterm without central control or weak security/privacy tradeoffs?
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:36:08


Hold up a second; lowering fees with segwit wouldn’t mean less money in coinbase’s pockets; if anything it would give them an opportunity to save on network fees *without* passing that full savings on, but i doubt that would be significant revenue either way.
From the time segwit went live in august, I imagine the fact of the matter is that the 200ish total employees have just been swamped trying to deal with user growth, growth which has happened in spite of rising fees. Their priorities might not be in attracting new customers when they’re struggling to keep basic services alive and functioning for the exponential growth they’re already seeing.
That said, get it together; make segwit a priority or risk losing customers to more competitive platforms once this current surge slows down.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:41:12
Coinbase wants the market as a whole to progress and grow, because that’s how they make money. If BTC comes out on top, great; if it’s another crypto, also great, as long as growth continues. They can’t afford to be die hard fan boys of any particular crypto at this point. 
I think you’re wrong about how the price dynamics of selling a bunch of BcH will go / would have gone. BCH is still new, and if BTC continues to be successful and grow before scaling solutions go live, fees may very well push a lot of people into alts before their infrastructure gets stressed enough to show the flaws in their value proposition (what do consistently full 8mb blocks do to the network? How does it sustain itself with perpetually low fees once block reward goes away?). I’ll agree to disagree on the motives and hypothetical effects of the above, i suppose

If you had a magic wand that could recreate BTC in 2009 from scratch and pick a long term inflation rate while also ensuring it could never be changed, would you still pick one diminishing to 0%?
While the hazard of a slippery slope for adjusting the inflation schedule is obviously dangerous, I wonder if the “satoshi was not an economist” argument for &gt;0% doesn’t have some weight, even if only to help reduce longterm wealth inequality. Maybe it’s just a measure of one’s personal politics.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:58:37
I'm not sure it's a stupid idea, I'm just of the view that it probably is.  I still own some BCH to hedge against my being wrong and the collection of people clamoring for massive on-chain increases being right that technology will grow to handle the load. 
I also don't think it's failings will become apparent until its actual block sizes eclipse BTC and we see the real result of public nodes dropping out of the network and being replaced by a smaller set of commercial ones. We'll see if BTC can get L2 solutions working in practice in advance of that happening.

A hardware wallet refers to a device whose sole purpose is to hold private keys securely in a way that make it impervious to all software (and some real, physical) hacking attempts while still offering a practical means of actually *using* those keys to send/receive.
Electrum is wallet software that is typically run on a general purpose computer like a PC or android phone or the like. The problem with such wallets is that because the computers they run on are designed to be very flexible with capability to run any program and many simultaneously, it's easier to "hack" by an external person that can tell that computer to run a malicious program/take action that compromises data like these private keys.
Hardware wallets (Like Trezor or Ledger) are designed to deliberately have extremely limited but extremely reliable functioning as computers; you can't "hack" them because they can only run the firmware on them, and that firmware requires interaction directly on the device (they all have external buttons) and verification by the user (they all have screens that confirm transaction info matches whatever software you're using to actually generate bitcoin transactions).
Electrum is one such piece of software that can work *with* hardware wallets like the above; Electrum uses software to read the blockchain, track balances, and basically do everything you could want it to *except* store the actual private key data, which makes it safe to run even on a computer you know might not be malware-free without risk of having your BTC stolen without your permission.

It’s only a linear reduction like that if the demand curve (supply vs price) is linear, which it likely isn’t. Doubling space might drop fees close to 0 if there isn’t sustained demand for 7ish tps... but most likely there would be.

Transaction speed *is* a component of liquidity as you have quoted from the article on liquidity, but it's important to put this into context; Etc may have tx confirm on chain securely within &lt; 1 minute compared to BTC's ~10-30 min and while that is a large % faster, both assets functionally move instantly compared to everything else in the world. Traditionally "illiquid" assets like a house or a car take orders of magnitude longer to sell (at close to their market values), and liquid assets like stocks take days to settle.
The volume and slippage issue between the two become more relevant; RSK can benefit from BTC's lower volatility, deeper order books, and higher overall volumes compared to other crypto's; still relatively volatile/shallow market wise compared to bigger asset classes, but much better than any other crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:22:25
500% reduction in what? The equilibrium point for price depends on what the actual demand curve looks like, which isn't well known at this point. As we move towards segwit adoption and the 80% effective capacity increase, fees might go down if demand growth lags, or just increase slower in BTC use demand even at this high fee level continues to grow.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:33:26
It’s important to remember that the only things that could cause bitcoin to drop back down to &lt;$1000 at this point are also the kinds of things that could very plausibly drop it down to &lt;$100 levels. Major, catastrophic network or crypto failures/loss of trust types of things. Not even a big country like the US straight making BTC illegal to own/use would drop it to $1k at this point, imo, with its global presence.

They think it would get dumped to death if they started supporting it, just because people holding balances of it would all sell? This has been happening for months now from a variety of other services like xapo and gbtc. You can’t dump a coin to death as long as there are fervent groups that want to use it like all the r:btc-ers.
The only question is “will it start gaining ground from NEW users”, and coinbase starting to support it would *definitely* be a feather in the cap of that currency; look at what it has done for LTC. Coinbase holding back support for BCH, even just withdrawls, is not supporting their price, nor is that coinbase’s goal.

@_date: 2017-12-14 20:56:21
Some computer somewhere might be doing 10-100k tx per sec, the Bitshares network is not. This is a discussion about network capability, not individual test proof of concepts. BCH has shown similar capability in theory, but getting to that level of capacity with today's technology requires completely changing the assumed network composition: far fewer nodes running far higher powered equipment. How do you support all the SPV demands in such a setup, or ensure that the relatively small collection of node owners don't get together to change the rules however they like?
If you're convinced that the financial benefit of cheaper tx offsets the security/self sovereignty of more aggressive decentralization, then maybe you have your answer; I'm OK making the latter a priority in BTC at some expense to the former.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:33:31
This thing was phenomenal. Fully legitimate mockery, of it’s complex new-ness, i’d say.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:16:29
Ask yourself how the network retains miners for security when the block reward fades away and everyone is only paying about a penny per tx, even with huge blocks. 
Also consider what happens when a huge chuck of the worlds transactions are on chain how anyone except (very) large companies will be able to run nodes, and once they are, what stops them not just from changing the consensus rules of how bitcoin works, or even changing them without you and your SPV wallet from understanding that they’ve changed.
That claim may very well be true, but thats not as hard a goal to achieve if you don’t care much about either of the above issues.

“Litterally everything”? Let’s not overstate things here, coinbase has been a massive factor in helping bitcoin become accessible and to aid in driving adoption and price rise.  I agree it’s silly they’re being slow with segwit, but there’s no need to be hyperbolic.
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:45:44
Agreed with all of the above. Let's start here, there are ~9500 full nodes according to [coin.dance]( That's higher than it was a few years ago. There are likely at least 1-2 orders of magnitude listening nodes more that we don't see on the network. Is that enough? I'm certain that answer varies from person to person, but I would love to hear arguments for either side.
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:28:33


I’m not sure i’m on board with your premise here. Almost nobody has a “requirement” to run a full node, since you can always just trust that the rest of the network will validate and enforce the protocol for you. With 100,000 full nodes, the marginal value of a 100,001st might be close to 0, but how few is too few such that all that trust becomes dangerous?
I think an alternative way to frame it might be “who has a right to run a full node”, since the premise of BTC is that participants aren’t *required* to trust anyone. 
But to your point, should that right extend to everyone, all the way down to the absolute least resource endowed person on earth, with access to only the ability to run what’s needed in a computer capable of today’s BTC network in perpetuity? That seems kind of absurd, too.
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:09:04
To try to play the other side of the argument, I can think of a few reasons. Bandwidth limits for one, would mean that just doubling the data size to (presumably) roughly double propogation time for blocks/tx could still very easily force a significant proportion of nodes permanently out of sync if they can't keep up with the total volume of data in any amount of time. Nodes don't just need 1.8MB/10min of download bandwidth to stay in sync, mine uses substantially more as it uploads to numerous peers, and there are definitely some parts of the world where it wouldn't be possible to maintain a full node if those bandwidth requirements were to double.
I guess what I want to understand is that if the latency-centralizing scaling bottleneck is fading from improved efficiency/relaying, are we just left with the bandwidth limitation? And if so, where do we personally think the network should be designed to stay sufficiently decentralized? I'm still trying to decide that answer for myself, but it's seeming like the currently very conservative resource requirements will some day in the foreseeable future become lower than optimal for the success of the network.
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:24:03

Good lord, not everything is an attempt to manipulate others, this was a good-faith effort to start a discussion. Only 1% of nodes dropping out if we were to do something like increase resource and I/O demand by 100% should be obviously, clearly too low. But it can be a useful starting point, because I think that for some people, even chasing out 1% of nodes for a capacity increase would be unacceptable! What are your thoughts on where that line should be?
I don't think it's the case for me, but I'd really like to hear from those that would draw the line there, and get a sense of what people in our community feel is the right way to manage this design tradeoff.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:01:01
Doesn't it seem from this data indicating robust improvements in block propogation that there would be room for a modest increase in block size while maintaining average rates on par or better with, say, 1 year ago? If block data sizes were to double, and prorogation time scales linearly with data size, wouldn't this chart suggest we'd maintain network propagation &lt;5 seconds, better than all of BTC's history before Oct of last year?
As you point out there are of course other factors to consider, but I haven't seen as much discussion about the *eventual* plans for a capacity change at the base level as I would have expected, while evidence of technology improvements creating breathing room like this have popped up.
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:02:42
My 1% wasn’t a guess or a prediction, and i fully expect it to be low. It was a starting point for whether there can be agreement for ANY sacrifice of user node running capability to benefit larger throughput for those than can continue to do so.
Your suggestions would amount to a great exercise, but one i lack the technical know how to execute. I’d sure be willing to help fund it for someone capable however, and i bet others would too.
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:35:36


This is I think the crux of the issue. I don't deny at all that this is the truth. But my question is what level of "some" is acceptable. Is any level acceptable? I would argue that it is, and if so, the community should be having a discussion on where to draw that line, since I don't see a reasonable argument that such an increase will never be necessary.
Lets start here: if a capacity increase on the network (that would enable more participants/activity on the network and/or lower fees) would conclusively lead to (only) 1% of the current full nodes to opt to shut down, would that tradeoff ever be worth it? Even before considering what sort of additional participation might be driven from a larger user base?
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:23:07
I did (and thanks by the way for taking the time to gather/share this data for discussion), but I don't know that it's too high today, would you characterize it as such? 
I would also expect that most transactions with a time sensitive use case are better connected than the slowest 90+% of nodes and that transaction prorogation delay would scale sub-linearly for modest increases in total bandwidth requirements. If mining centralizing pressures from prorogation delays were once one of the biggest barriers to capacity increases, I'd love to better understand what the chief limiting factors are becoming today.

As a student in Duke's business school and an avid Bitcoin enthusiast, I'm very much looking forward to this class. It seems important and necessary to draw more interest from the academic community on this emerging field.
As an overview for the class, there are lectures planned to discuss basics of blockchain tech, the economics of the Bitcoin network specifically, some disruptive potential of blockchain tech in general (including some Bitcoin 2.0 innovations) along with discussions of the regulatory environment, contract law, and an intro to venture capital. 
The class grade is aimed to be entirely based on a final team project consisting of at least one business, law, and computer science student at Duke working together to formulate a proposal for a business venture, which seems like just about the best way to get your feet wet in this complex subject matter.

The problem is that he IS doing exponential math for both costs and block size growth, when it should be exponential for storage costs, but linear growth for blockchain size. He comes up with an 80% annual growth rate for the TOTAL blockchain size, applied each year going forward for 20 years, which is preposterous for a variety of reasons. We've had that kind of growth early, because the starting point was 0.

Expressing fee in terms of USD today is fine, it represents the "real" amount of value today equivalent to $0.07. Sometime later, that same real value will be denominated in some higher amount of USD, assuming inflation, and (probably) some lower amount of BTC. 
You raise a good point though; perhaps the best way to think of an ideal fee target is in a % of total BTC value? In that case, is 1 satoshi the right amount, and why?
Also, fees not trending to 1 satoshi doesn't spell disaster. That's the old "that place is too crowded, so no one goes there anymore" argument.

Apologies for mischaracterizing the source of your 80%. You may not have started from 0 and included 2009/10 in your average, but as others point out, you still assume 1.) effectively no block size limit, and no transactions moving "off chain", and 2.) Exponential growth at the current rate for another 20 years, rather than some kind of S-curve which would be more realistic based on how spread of new technologies works. I would strongly disagree with both of these assumptions.

Things like this will change with fee pressure, to be sure, for which there is mercifully little right now, but poised to change considerably with just a few 10's of % demand. 
I suppose the question is how much growth you you forsee over the next 3-5 years if BTC is to be successful, and how much growth you you think the system can take even with the above improvements before fee pressure becomes intolerable for new use and halts or even begins to reverse it?
I'd argue the above improvements are great for a ~2x efficiency improvement, but certainly not a 10x, which is where I'd predict demand for BTC would go if it were completely unfettered.

Would one always reliably make such a killing? Especially if such a pattern became evident? If you were to make a large short into a thin market, you only profit once you closed your position,  which is liable to have the sane effect on price in reverse. If the market reaction to a big drop driven not by souring sentiment but by sudden large “whale” sell volume, doesn’t that just paint an obvious opportunity for other enterprising whales to buy that dip instead, taking all that “killing” and then some for themselves?
It’s not clear to me how either futures specifically (vs. say other derivatives like call options or margin trading) would make this strategy and more possible or safe than without them, or how “unlimited fiat” benefits the strategy, other than for someone to be unconcerned with losing capital to BTC bulls in order to temporarily delay natural price action.

Is LN thought to be the only capacity multiplier in the next few years?

Even improvements like schnorr don’t add more than a ~30-40% efficiency increase, and aren’t poised to be in place across network infrastructure if there’s another bull run. The question is, what happens this time if there’s newcomer demand for crypto, and people new to the industry see one network with $5+ tx fees, while other prominent ones are close to 0? Why would crypto newbies jump into BTC rather than cheaper options which appear to be the same (even moreso if their price catches up)?

I think the points above fail to consider that bitcoin grows and changes dynamically, and isn't anywhere near a static equilibrium. The whole point of developing off-chain solutions isn't to eliminate the need for the base layer, but *to allow the system to grow* with more users without sacrificing the (expensive) trustless, decentralized properties of the base layer that make it so unique and valuable.
The great concern surrounding the blocksize debate has been that BTC isn't ready for another wave of growth; providing effective solutions to enable more activity in the system without having to put it all on the mainchain except when that level of security/trustlessness is needed is the whole goal.

Why is it a bad thing that miners don't get a cut of every single off chain transaction? We should only be worrying about fees up to the point that we're certain the total revenue is enough to secure the network; at the rate we're at now, it's looking like fees will always be &gt;10 BTC/block, but let's be conservative and say 5+/block assuming they just stay at ~ the level they're at now as the block reward goes to 0, and don't increase in total as the block size increases in the future, or get anything from L2 (those can actually go to well connected, well funded nodes!) 
5 BTC/block in fees * 144 blocks/day * 365days/year  = ~250k BTC/year in fees or ~1.25% of all the value in all of bitcoin getting spent on fees every year. Maybe that's not the exact perfect level of security we want to ensure the network stays secure, but I think that's very much in the ballpark of what should be expected for a system like this. How do you think it should work longterm?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:37:52
This is a great argument for a ~20% annual compounding blocksize [increase]( Now whether we start at a somewhat comical reduction from current size or from current size as this author suggests, or from 2MB is another debate. Totally on board with an approach like this by the way, even though 17% annual increases would still likely way underpace demand leading to overall tx fees to stay relatively high.

I don't think there have been any substantial global financial crises where Bitcoin has been tested, which was the point I tried to make in the comment above. Rises in it's history cannot be reasonably attributed to people flocking to BTC as a financial haven.

Let's look at that a little differently. With $1M (after taxes, lets say), you can build a nice diversified portfolio in the stock market. From there, based on the past history of performance since the market's inception, you're safe to pull out ~3% of it (~$30,000 per year, more to adjust for inflation), every year forever, with a very high probability of it lasting longer than you'll live. A pension of that much per annum can absolutely be life changing.

These are all good points, maybe i wasn't being fair. The changeover from transactions would be more political messaging than user impact operational, for the most part. Users can still send with and receive at any address format they want, what the exchanges use doesn't really impact them.

*Mandatory* trust is bad. Everyone should have the freedom and flexibility to choose to trust another entity to take action on their behalf if they judge that risk to be worth the reward. It's only when people have no option *but* to trust another entity that the incentives to not abuse that trust go away and we end up with problems. 
Bitcoin, to me, is about creating a fundamental technology that allows for trustless alternatives in those mandatory situations, not about eliminating all trust between mutually consenting entities.

Got it. Who is poised to control LN? Not blockstream. Who is poised to run hubs as well connected peers with capital? Maybe blockstream, but not to the exclusion of many, many other interested parties on a network that is so far being designed to be interoperable and open.
How does blockstream plan to make money? Creating customized sidechain projects for customers and managing certificates for those that they create to ensure authenticity seems like a great start. But in none of those scenarios have they exclusive control over new features made possible with their open source work on the public blockchain. 
Everyone seems to assume that the only way to preserve their competitive advantage is to somehow lock out new entrants; but I think the much simpler explanation is that they'll be able to make better use of these new, customizeable features because they seem to employ the sharpest, most experienced developers in the crypto space. That's enough for me to invest in right there.

This last high profitability period on BCH of 2016 blocks paid out 12.5*2016 = 25,200 BCH, worth approximately $16M .

I don't see how it's different. You decided not going to sell your BCH (or whatever else) today, but If all your BCH was suddenly sold without you making the choice, you wouldn't then buy it back? Why not?
Im not suggesting you try to time the market, I'm only arguing that investing in any asset is an active choice, and one that you make continuously. Hodling isn't about doing nothing, it is choosing to continue to hold an extremely high risk, high reward asset. Don't fool yourself into thinking you're not making a choice when you elect to continue not selling an asset you own, because you are. It's your choice to make, and for whatever reasons you decide, but forgetting that you're making one is almost a sure way to make a wrong one eventually.

You bring up some great points about why it's really wonderful that miner's *don't* get to control bitcoin! There will be miners for whatever form bitcoin takes that lends the most profit to miners, which will almost certainly be whatever coin has the highest value, which will be whatever the economic majority believes is the most valuable and useful to them, regardless of what would be the sweetest deal for miners. Some consideration of ensuring enough incentive to be attack resistant is important, but only enough to get to that point.
The tricky part with trying to ensure most people or everyone can afford to transact cheaply onchain is that technology limitations + tragedy of the commons will end up ensuring nobody can transact onchain both cheaply AND securely.

For some, the risk of screwing it up yourself is just plain greater than the risk of trusting a place like coinable to do it. We'll never have mass adoption with anywhere near 100% of people safely securing their own coins. It's just a huge benefit that you can do so if you want/need to.

I gotcha; are you advocating for 2x, or for a bigger push for onchain scaling in general? It seems to me like the (maybe justified) view of much of the core team is that being distributed and censorship resistant is more important than being fast and inexpensive, and when scaling, it's better to err on the side of too much of the former rather than too little.

This is somewhat naive investing advice. "if it goes to 0, so what" and the attitude that "found" money should be treated frivolously is a great way to do silly things with it.
Maybe the assumption that holding BCH as a hedge against BTC is good advice, however. The real question you and everyone else should ask themselves (constantly) is "If i had the equivalent amount of $ and no crypto in an exchange right now, how would I choose to allocate it?" If that choice is different than what you're currently holding, then adjust.

Withdrawing 3% of total investment every year to live on, similar to how endowments function.

I think the conspiracy is not that blockstream employs developers, but rather that all of the idealistic cypherpunk developers that blockstream now employs only work there because they've abandoned the values that drove them to work on bitcoin in the first place to help assist with a corporate takeover of BTC in exchange for lucrative software engineering jobs in silicon valley (that they couldn't otherwise get?).

As a huge bitcoin bull who thinks we should put 2x on hold, i think you're hugely underestimating the value generated from the BCH split, and have an overly optimistic outlook on what bitcoin "should" have risen to.
I'll paint a competing picture: I think bitcoin's price and interest has had a damper on it from the toxicity and uncertainty generated through the scaling debate. People within bitcoin, hodling, but uncertain about the people in the ecosystem pulling the technology they saw as unwise or dangerous. Once a split became clear, with a coin more purely laid out for the direction of competing scaling philosophies, those people (and even more on the sidelines) could finally invest more directly in line with their beliefs. This is leading to the total value of the two coins greater than the total value of the original coin (or what the original coin would have been).

I'm hugely bullish, and have been hodling for years. I'm not missing the concept that Bitcoin is scarce, and network effects are valuable. My point is that it's naive to think BTC or even crypto in general isn't fraught with risk. This is incredibly new territory, and the future is uncertain, never forget there are things you don't know you don't know, and act accordingly.

I think it's a more complicated game of chicken, or maybe mutually assured destruction. Miners, if they can coordinate, can effectively go on strike and stop mining the current chain, in favor of stopping or mining something else or w/e. But if they do that, the value of their income streams (and of any current BTC holdings) can drop precipitously... how long can they keep on that course if the community at large (users, merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc) don't accept or place value in the alternate coin?
To your point, if miners switch, how long can the community continue to support valuing a chain with little to no security/block generation? I don't think it's clear whether one of those sides is destined to lose that game, and it might end up with a suboptimal outcome for both, if neither budge for an extended duration.

If there are 1000 copies of that pokemon card, and all it's owners believe it's worth at least $1000 and wont sell for less, and just a single buyer comes forward and buys one at $1000, then hypothetical exchanges of this card would show a price of $1000, market cap of $1M, even if there weren't corresponding buyers for the other 999 cards at $1000, and volume of this asset is only $1000. Repeat at higher prices for a higher market cap, if sentiment of the above actors leads to an increase in value.
The link you showed doesn't quite mean what you described; it explains market maker incentives, paying people (buyers AND sellers) who put orders on books which increases liquidity rather that take existing offers, reducing it.

Bitcoin is riskier than more traditional assets. At 1M, i'd agree, let it ride, but at a certain point the potential for higher return isn't worth that risk, and its time to diversify.

How many of those spikes happened when there were only 1-3 functioning exchanges globally? I think the answer is all of them, and given how shady/insolvent some of them (mt. gox) ended up being, it makes some sense how crazy volatile out of whack prices were able to become. I don't think we'll ever see that kind of volatility again with markets more mature and distributed today over dozens of big ones.

Your definition of what what an investment "better" should start to change with your age and wealth. In your 20's, when poor but with lots of earning potential through labor, ultra-high risk, high reward investments like Crypto are great. By the time you start to have more money than you'll ever need, getting a higher return doesn't make an investment "better" for you anymore, you might want to start to become more concerned with risk mitigation.
As a rough illustration, All the money you need for the rest of your life * 100% &gt;&gt; 2x All the money you need * 90% + losing a lot of it *10%. Diversifying into many different investments is the best (only?) way to mitigate that risk of loss down.

@_date: 2017-08-25 21:30:04
I think they're helpful in the same way that uber surge fees are helpful. 
Do high fees slow down adoption by limiting use cases, and is that a risk? Absolutely yes to both. But they also incentivize development of actual scaling improvements rather than just capacity improvements, which will ensure that BTC remains unassailable as it gets larger, an maintaining that property I feel is the key to it's sustained value. 
I think we could probably afford to be a little bit bigger, but believe there's much less risk erring too small and growing slower than possible, rather than erring to large and blowing up that key property.
Also, segwit just activated a few days ago; lets give the ecosystem a chance to see what that can really do in terms of improvement, and how the BCH oscillation of death proceeds to shake out.

A couple of things:
- No one is advocating fewer blocks, large or small, in any plan I'm aware of. Regardless of plan, blocks are still targeting 1 find every 10 minutes through mining difficulty adjustment, block overhead and all.
- Block space used for fixed non-transaction data ("overhead") is extremely small, &lt;1% of current blocks, even less with larger blocks, not a ton of potential for efficiency gains from improving it.

2 parts here: before you consider buying any bitcoin, be sure you first understand the basics of how they are secured. It sounds like you're interested in buying to hold longer term, and especially in not needing to involve a 3rd party, which suggests a "paper wallet" is probably going to be best for you.
As for a source to acquire them with Euros, you might consider Bitstamp as an exchange based in europe (one of the biggest/longest history), or even localbitcoins as a means of buying. I use Coinbase easily (and happily) but I'm in America, unsure how well that works over there.

The problem is that when it’s a terrible deal to hold USD, with inflation and low (or negative) interest rates, it forces people to buy any investment they can in order to seek returns... which leads to pushing down those returns and leads people to pour money into bad investments, like shit bonds and WeWork, chasing better returns at much higher risk.

Blockchain explorers also look in the mempool. Their own local mempool, built on whatever they've happened to heard, or disregard. The Mempool is not the blockchain, by definition, as it is full of tx that are not in blocks.


It would just require blocks to be orphaned, not 'hard forked'. Orphans (used to happen) all the time, and still do from time to time today. And again, i think we're mixing what it means to 'be recorded' and to 'be included in a block (the first confirmation, by definition).
That said, practically speaking, for non-RBF flagged tx that are given some time to propogate without and conflicting tx, I agree are relatively low risk. I can't speak for everyone, but I'd accept them for lowish value retail tx, as long as their fee isn't 0.
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:30:29
While I agree that does sound like a real threat to the utility that paxful offers, and i agree that they should make such a fee loud and clear, especially for new users, I’d also argue it’s your responsibility, as a consumer, to decide for yourself if the value proposition their service offers is worth it to you. It sounds like this fee might be enough to get you to stop using their service, and if so, i’d definitely let them know. If its not however... then it sounds like Paxful is finding a way to charge enough to make a profit while still offering enough value to keep users.
It’s not their responsibility to offer you a good deal, it’s your responsibility to decide if the deal they offer is enough to get you to use their service : )

Not to quible, as i think you have a point about tx not flagged for RBF, but it won’t ‘appear on the blockchain’ until it’s no longer a 0-conf tx.
What you’re saying is that new tx that spend a utxo that is already being used in a tx in a standard nodes mempool just wouldn’t be propogated? To the OPs point, i don’t think a block that contained such a second tx would be rejected even by such nodes that saw the other tx first, hence ‘not safe’... but maybe safe enough.

By Barriers to entry, I think he means in the [5 Forces]( sense of the word. There is no competitive advantage any individual firm can easily achieve (ASIC know how probably comes closest) to more efficiently generate profits / extract rents. If Mining ever becomes significantly profitable, there's nothing to prevent new/additional miners from starting up and competing that profit away. Regional laws are one barrier, but there's no reason to think ones will pop up that wouldn't affect all miners equally - not a barrier to entry.
That said, I think he's mistaken that a high BTC price with a high demand for blockspace --&gt; tx fees wouldn't bid up a profitable mining level beyond the market price of 'waste' energy, outcompeting other similar low value applications that might somehow emerge. 
What I'd argue, though, is that if they can't outcompete BTC for energy on price, they're not more important applications.

On day 1, what wallets / software will support segwit transactions? What needs to be done to make them?
@_date: 2016-12-12 09:01:44
1.) Bitcoin is controlled by the economic weight of its users. Decentralization doesn't mean there can't be a group of like minded contributors with a vision for the technology that ends up with a majority of users, it just means that as a user, anyone CAN choose to run and support whatever software/developers they choose, including following a fork if they deem it necessary. There are other developers, with competing ideologies and software, and people following them/running their code; just maybe not as many people as they might like. Or at least, not enough yet to have committed to fork to a different path. There is a method to vote: Run nodes, use services, and buy/hold coin(s) of the tech you support.
2.) What would you propose to do about fees? Price (fee) competition is a natural result of demand for a scarce resource(blockspace). You could argue whether current blockspace limits are appropriate, but surely you aren't trying to argue that there shouldn't be fees at all?
3.) To your point about mining, you can get your proportional share of block rewards today by just plugging in a modern miner and connecting to a pool. Many large pools are not single entities, and those that are aren't reaping profits beyond what would be expected from the risks they take and costs they incur to mine. Profits which tend towards 0 when the price isn't continually on the rise. I'm missing your concern here too, since this seems expected (even intended) to me.

I think the simplest answer is that there isn't a single "they", there are several implementations in development from different teams. For example, in addition to the one you listed, there's a work in progress from Blockchain.info team:
Also, there is some uncertainty about assumptions to use for development; whether Segwit will be active for example can have a big impact on design decisions and functionality, some teams may be waiting until there is more certainty before more heavily committing resources.

I was in the audience for this; in case it's too hard to hear, as Matt brought up his previous idea to get Rogers interest in a lightning-like scaling idea, Roger here readily admits "we absolutely dropped the ball on that one".
Matt came across as really calm, capable, and insightful, both in his talk and in panel discussions. Roger came across as passionate and well intentioned, from a perspective of a VC/business owner concerned that Bitcoin-the-product isn't making the right design choices to maximize its user base, and that the best path to long term success is to be focusing on that goal. Matt didn't openly advocate for a specific path on scaling, but did an excellent job arguing that the choice is nowhere near as simple or obvious as some of the "bigger blocks now" crowd presents the cost/benefit.

What would lead tx fees to become ‘too big’? Clearly they’re not too big for the people already filling full blocks with them, for whatever reason, in your scenario.

Not completely sure what you mean by this. The whole point of the technology is to be immune from un-capped inflation. Just the 21 million whole BTC. There would need to be a massive movement convincing a majority of stakeholders across the ecosystem to change this, as opposed to convincing a few Fed members it's time for more QE.
If a bunch more dollars get printed, then relative to everything else, BTC holds it's purchasing power relative to real goods, and the dollar just loses it. That sounds like inflation resistance/hedging to me.

What do you mean? BTC has blocks (*actual* blocks) much larger than BCH (&gt;10x), BCH hasn’t demonstrated anything other than that it’s possible to route large test blocks around the network without immediately crashing. If you think that’s what BTC supporters were saying is impossible then you haven’t really been listening.

Yes. You’re right that BCH has much larger blocksize **limits**,  but no one has yet made use of more than ~100kb blocks for sustained periods , compared to consistent &gt;1MB blocks on BTC. Raising the limit isn’t as hard as maintaining a growing, widely distributed network with blocks actually near that larger limit.

I can help explain. You’re mistakenly equating participating in a network (accessing LN for only whatever you’re looking to spend, or running a full BTC node to ensure the validity of money you send or receive) with facilitating or securing that network (actively providing liquidity for others as a larger “hub”, or investing in ASICs to mine BTC). You get all the benefits of the technology for personal use just doing the former, because it’s relatively easy and completely permission-less for people in a wide variety of jurisdictions to do the latter.
The goal of pushing for 2L scaling was to ensure that **participation** in the network was widely accessible, along with retaining it’s value proposition that it’s security remained decentralized to prevent capture/abuse. LN still fits that description perfectly; there are millions of moderately wealthy people in every significant jurisdiction in the world.

$50,000 or $100,000 is still a trivial amount in startup capital for an operation that should be extremely low risk for loss, like running a LN node. Single people out of their garage could launch an operation like that as meaningful competition at that scale. I think even if the scale to be a functional LN hub rises significantly, given how low risk and passive the setup is, there will be many, many people or small groups with access to the funds needed and the interest to run hubs, at almost no real startup “cost”, as the capital is just needed as a fully refundable bond. Those are really low barriers to entry, by any market standard.
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:49:41
The mempool only falls vertically, as blocks are found. I’m not sure what you mean by rising “100% vertical”, do you mean there were bouts of thousands of tx broadcast within seconds? I don’t think there was any evidence of that. Evidence patterns of high volume, high tx fee paying transaction that suggest wash volume intended to raise fees? That would support your argument that fees didn’t rise from real demand, but I don’t think theres any analysis to support that either, unless you have some? If not, you’re just speculating on a hunch because it feels like someone was out to get us.

The space is still very, very small, and it’s far from the time to tear down crypto proponents for having similar views on most, but differing views on some, of what makes crypto interesting/valuable. Thinking it’s prudent to increase the blocksize, and then going along with the concensus to not do so doesn’t make you an enemy of BTC, it makes you someone with a slightly different sense of what an acceptable risk is in building a new technology. Supporting altcoins when there’s a demand for services around them doesn’t either. You might have a good point on latest hires, but i’m not informed enough on that point yet to debate it.

I completely agree that the stakes are higher than for some new tech product, but that leads me to the even more serious question: Is it not a moral failing today to not be planning to make bitcoin more adaptable for an increased demand it seems we can all agree is poised to happen? 
I understand that addressing capacity on chain can threaten decentralization, but is absolutely no tradeoff in that direction still the right technical choice in 2019? We don’t seem to be reconsidering when the right time for a capacity increase might be, even something reasonable like yearly 17% increases in line with the average rate of global bandwidth increases. Do we not owe it to future users (and ourselves) to do everything possible to prevent their pricing out?

Welcome to the crypto industry. With huge growth and huge gains come huge uncertainty, which requires allocating resources for items like this that might end up changing at the drop of a hat. Sudden shifts like this WILL reduce over time, once the industry matures; anyone who isn't willing to handle those swings early is welcome to sit out the party until others iron it out for them and reap most of the rewards.

They want Bitcoin as we know it to continue on with 2MB base blocks. I understand that from your perspective, this would be killing the chain you would stay on, but with community agreement, a 2MB fork could have easily continued to be bitcoin to everyone else, and I really think that is the perspective most if not all the 2x supporters were coming from.

Say at BTC price = 1 and BCH price = 0.15, steady state hashrate would be X and 0.15X (neglect fees for now). If BCH rose 3x and BTC stayed the same, with no change in total hashrate, again neglecting fees, you’d expect a new equilibrium to be found at total hashrate /total value = 1.15X / (1 + 0.45) = 0.79X for BTC, and the remaining 0.36X for BCH, a 21% drop in blockspeed, slightly less than 5/hour.
After you factor in fees of ~10-20% of block reward or higher in congestion,  the drop would be significantly less, only 10-15% falloff with a tripling of BCH.

Best way would be to have coin on coinbase prior to the fork, then promptly sell B2X post fork to push the market consensus towards BTC.

Do you think one of the main drivers of the fee rate then vs now is improved fee estimation? Frankly, i’m concerned we’ll soon hit consistent full blocks and fees will rise *fast* and eat up most of the consumer surplus again. Capacity pressure release valves don’t feel ready for another step up in adoption, presently, from what I see.

I’m sorry, but that’s not what caused fees to climb and stay elevated for weeks. That’s a fun paranoid theory that doesn’t make any sense, strategically or practically, and there isn’t evidence to support it. I guess we’ll agree to disagree here, but the real bummer is that the same conditions are likely to arise again as demand picks back up if we ever enter another rally.

The privacy aspects of LN are really compelling, but I can already see signs of an “BTC adoption really is growing, we just can’t see it!” arguments forming as an argument against ever improving on chain capacity, even modestly, in the future, which concerns me.

Don’t forget the time value of that money (the opportunity cost of having it locked up in LN instead of being consumed or put to some other productive purpose). This might be especially low with BTC compared to other capital, but I would certainly expect it to exceed the very modest costs of powering the equivalent of a single laptop computer full time. No additional mining power is needed to keep LN nodes running/routing/secure.

@_date: 2019-02-19 21:52:35
0.25% return per month on capital providing liquidity for LN is absolutely *massive*, equivalent to ~3% annual ROI on a non-inflationary asset like BTC. If those were prevailing rates in a maturing LN, I know I for one would rush to provide my own node/rates considerably lower than that to steal some of that volume.
That said, we’re also not quite looking at this right; fees are only charged on routing when provided; some capital locked up might not get utilized in a month and be able to demand higher fees, others might get used, many, many times per day and earn fees each time, which would suggest much lower rates on those channels should be more than possible. 
There is a looot of complexity to be baled into a fee market for something without a good previous comparable model, like LN, will be curious to watch it evolve!

Who says no one wants money sitting idle if it's a deflationary currency like Bitcoin? With fiat, you can put it in a savings account to loan out to others to accrue interest, but that's because you're trying to fight the effects of inflation; maybe not a concern with BTC.
For hubs, charging tiny but easy to collect fees on payments may be worth keeping that BTC "idle". Additionally, payment channels CAN go both ways; one merchants customers are another firms workers, or vendors.

Specifically, a hard fork is defined as a **loosening** of the ruleset, meaning it allows for new tx or blocks that previously would have been invalid (like allowing for blocks larger than the current limit, rejected by un upgraded nodes.
A soft fork by contrast is a **tightening** of the ruleset to a subset of what was previously allowed. Segwit for example, was created within the existing rulespace, in a way that would allow it to create what would have previously been considered anyonecanspend transactions, now limited to only the owners.

To play a little devils advocate, fees can either increase from the same number of users paying more, or from a great many new users all paying a little, the latter of which is the stated plan for long term BCH security by its proponents.

Longest chain doesn't matter if no nodes/users run clients that can see it. Economic majority doesn't immediately convert in a case like that, which means very limited demand for coins on that network, compared to the original, leading to big incentives for miners to defect back to the original chain, which spirals into a failed fork.
Miners matter, just not in having the power to unilaterally change Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:51:03
Just make the blocks bigger is possible to accomplish if you’re cool with overall node count trending down, with a dubious future for mining security, putting most of the truly unique and valuable qualities of bitcoin at risk. Satoshi certainly hand-waved a picture as to how he assumed the network could grow, but he didn’t stick around to actually see what problems the network faced as it got larger, where as many other people have who disagree with the ease of what you’re saying.

Two issues with that:
1.) bitcoin market cap(price) rising indefinitely doesn’t mean miner revenue rises indefinitely, and wouldn’t be likely to. During this price rise it would be expected scaling would also be improved, including lowering the tx fee in satoshis over time, which may (or may not) level out in value over time.
2.) price rise indefinitely wouldn’t be enough, as soon as it grows large enough to start demonstrating predictable growth, miners can get ahead of the growth curve and have mining equipment turn on faster than this growth rate, until the profit differential becomes low enough that new equipment slows down to just match growth.
On second thought, i have a better description: mining profitability trends towards the “risk-free rate of return”, probably close to ~2% or so, similar to the return on US treasury bonds. Not wuite 0, but still a predictably low, static, decreasing quantity as uncertainty about BTC declines.

More full nodes, more widely dispersed is more decentralized than we have today, but nodes per user would go down. Would that be a beneficial tradeoff?

By the nature of BTC mining, this variance has always been seen. Block solutions are a random process, literally just guessing inputs to the SHA256 hash function, until an output happens to have the right number of leading 0's. Sometimes this happens within a few seconds of the previous solution, sometimes an hour or more later, only on average every 10 minutes, if difficulty is set perfectly for hash rate.
1 hour of slow blocks is a data point that *suggests* a drop in hash rate, but is nowhere near a large enough sample size to say so with any significant confidence.

Playing games? This is a nascent industry they are poised currently in leading positions for, they have no incentive to take risks by “playing games” for bigger personal gains. Their incentives are aligned better than anyone else to profit from a steadily advancing ship; their only fear was that capacity limits were going to be the iceberg that threw everything to hell.

What do you mean by 'setting a price'? Miners have an incentive to maximize their own profits, not to balance the perfect load on the rest of the network resources. That's why the limit on tx is imposed on them by the other users of the system, rather than being totally up to them to choose.


Again, a limit miles higher than actual usage doesn't indicate anything about the robustness of a system. You can believe it *will* be secure/robust in the future, but it absolutely hasn't been demonstrated yet.

Miners MAY be holders of the currency, but they are definitely holders of futures on the currency in the form of huge investment into mining hardware.

If you’re saying spamming with low fee tx or declining to mine full blocks can be responsible for that kind of fee spike, then i disagree, but even if it were the root cause, BTC NEEDS to be able to handle that kind of low key interference without price-spikes to be viable long term.

You don’t open a channel with a grocery store, you open it with some kind of hub. Put your paycheck in, buy groceries with one tx, buy gas the next day, dinner and a movie after that, and close the channel only when funds are tapped.
The grocery store doesn’t have to wait for you; they had a channel with a hub as well, for a large amount, and are getting payments through it from many other customers. If they want an arrangement to close out every day, they could, or wait a little longer to save on fees, or MUCH longer if they can pay their own suppliers, utilities, workers through that same channel in a bidirectional manner like LN can allow.

Mining profits do tend towards 0 in an equilibrium. If mining profits are &gt;0, more people will buy mining equipment and mine until the difficulty lowers profitability towards 0, when new investment stops.

No, even in this one what i said is true, mining profit *trends* towards 0, even if continual new developments move the price or rate of investment around. I understand we’re not at equilibrium and there are more variables, but they’re all dynamic distortions, not static ones, and all they do is cause investment to lag reaching that equilibrium point. Eventually one would be reasonable in assuming volatility calmed down to a point where mining profit could become much more predictable, which means rational actors will invest towards competing almost all of the profit out of the system.

You’re very welcome, it was a fun exercise. As for the fee’s, you can think of it like this; my scenario just compared price ratio between the two, which only works if block rewards match (12.5 BTC/block). Having higher fees as a base brining total up to 15.5/block would be the same as getting 12.5 BTC worth (15.5/12.5 = 24%) more, meaning the real ratio of BCH to BTC block reward wouldn’t be 0.15 (price ratio), but rather 0.121; tripling to 0.36.

Capital is a barrier to entry in this business model, as in almost all others, but how much isn’t obvious at this point. The key is that unlike other businesses, requiring expertise, risk tolerance, IP, or some other competitive advantage, capital is the ONLY barrier to entry here.
Centralization ( read: monopoly power) is only bad because it provides opportunity for abuse with no recourse; profits can be high or market power can be abused because new entrants can’t get in to offer better alternatives. With few barriers to entry, high threat of substitues, and lots of bargaining power from buyers in a well connected network, potential for profits and abuse from hubs  is likely to be fairly low.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:37:12
Blocks propagate across the network today in just a few seconds; leaving only that incredibly narrow window as orphan risk, which is the force that would drive centralization as you're describing. Other factors, like access to mining hardware and cheap electricity, are much stronger factors for mining centralization today than block size.
Furthermore, spam doesn't work the way it sounds like you're describing. Miners aren't broadcasting tx with fees they pay to themselves, they would just hold onto them to include in blocks without the risk of giving those tx/fees away.
If you think I'm wrong about any of the above I think you need to provide some numbers to illustrate the point you're trying to make.

Eventually, that checks out.
Right now, we're at emission at ~15 BTC/10 min incl fees * 6/hour * 24 hours *365 days = 788k BTC to miners * $6500/BTC = ~$5B. If you assume a 10% subsidy and 50% of global hash rate, thats $0.25B/year from gov... significant, but a long shot from the $1000B+ in gov budgets for countries like china or USA.

Just out of curiosity, is there a fee level that could be reached prior to widespread functional L2 solutions that would make you support a capacity bump up through a hard fork (well planned/communicated in advance, not forced through, on 2018 technology)?
Would your answer change if base chain fees are still high after L2 solutions are available but user growth is so high that even using only L2 for tx generation anchored to L1 is still filling up the base chain with expensive tx?

All excellent ideas, that should be worked on, but are also *not* exclusive ideas from increasing on chain capacity, especially if they're not sufficient. Compression ideas like Schnorr are great, but are 10-40% efficiency improvements, not radical, exponential gains like one would need to accommodate the kind of growth BTC has demonstrated while remaining at the current base blockweight. Sidechains and LN are good multipliers, that could turn single base chain tx into 10s or 100's off offchain tx...but still require new users to use the base blockchain, at a **minimum** of once. 
Do you anticipate the potential for BTC to become a major reserve currency, like I do? Do you know how long it would take to onboard even the first 1 billion people to these great second layer solutions assuming we used all the available blockspace to give everyone just a single tx? 1 Billion people / ~4000tx/block / 6 blocks per hour / 24 hours/day / 365 days /year = ~ 4.7 years. With what frequency do you project being an acceptable rate of use for the base blockchain per person? I would argue once every 4-5 years being vastly too little. The argument that the system and it's users wouldn't benefit from more onchain capacity because there are other improvements in the works doesn't hold water.


Potentially a valid concern, but we need to be considering the impact of this, quantitatively. As was debated several years ago, if we consider the top gate to scaling to be bandwidth availability and use that as a limit to growth, increases blocksize of ~17% per year would still be sufficient to keep current levels of decentralization, even before assuming any of the improvements to efficiency discussed above. Why would we not plan to adopt such a change? What is the argument today that it isn't safe to do so?


What do you mean by anytime? Something like this, a first hard fork upgrade in BTC history, would need at least 12-18 months lead time from agreement on a plan to actually activating it. Do you not expect any kind of surge in demand for BTC that would require more capacity to meet in the next 18 months? That would seem very pessimistic to me.

Price stagnation, in the last few months (and aftereffects of the last bubble in general), maybe, but there’s hardly been stagnation in general. There’s an absolutely bonkers [amount of technical development in progress]( just laying the groundwork to absorb future waves of people, when some sort of geopolitical shock raises bitcoin’s profile again. 
Remember 2012? We’ve seen these bubble cycles before, and we’ve lived through these same ‘stagnant’ periods before. They looked and felt a lot like this, just much smaller.

People can already dump huge amounts of coins on the market today pre-fork, if they were so inclined. As for this post-fork attack, they'd be selling coins on one fork and presumably buying on the other...wouldn't do any damage to my holdings, which would exist on both chains. No worse than the risk of that today.

If even today we’re already well past what a decentralized network can sustain in terms of capacity, do you still think bitcoin has the ability to revolutionize global finance, or even be interesting?
Longer term, in say 10 years or so, how do you predict people interacting with the blockchain? Today, ~15k people are born and 6k people die every hour on earth, which is just about the same number of BTC tx confirmed. Even with all the best theorized 2L improvements in place, can BTC be useful if the average person only makes 2tx a lifetime? Is even 100x that enough in the longterm? 
I’m certainly not a technical expert, but I need to get to a point where I understand the rationale for that guidance to accept it, and I think a lot of other people do too.  What in your understanding is the bottleneck on safe/wise onchain capacity increases? I would love to be convinced we’re in the right spot, but i’m struggling to see it.

Well, the tricky thing about fees is that there's sometimes a world of difference between what you have to pay and hat people actually *are* paying. You can see from a tracker like [this one]( what actual fees are in the mempool now (colored bars) vs. what have been confirmed in the last few hundred blocks (grey bars). While the mempool is coming back down after mining returned to normal, tx with fees at a 100-150 satoshi/byte are again confirming within a couple of blocks if not sooner, and yet, people are STILL sending tx paying 800+ sat/byte, and they are sending them because their fee estimators see other people sending them and recommend fees this high in order to guarantee inclusion in the next block with 95+% certainty, rather than pay ~10-20% as much for 80% certainty, with close to 95+% certainty on inclusion in one of the next few blocks.
There will be a lot of competition for fee optimization in wallets and exchanges going forward, including but not limited to migrating to cheaper tx formats like segwit.
I honestly can't predict when steady state fees rise to that level in perpetuity. I'm using a HW wallet with Segwit,and have been paying $2-3 in recent times (not including this weekend).

And the silly thing about this whole debate is that the majority of big blockers I know agree with this, and the whole source of this schism in the community is just disagreement over which should come first! The BCH people aren’t opposed to 2L, they just want to put it off because they don’t see the concern with pushing small nodes of the network in favor of “the $10,000 rig” acting as a node, maybe only in regions with powerful internet.
I don’t agree with that sentiment, and am glad we’re pushing 2L first, but i could understand someone having the opposing view, even if a little short sighted.

This isn’t correct, miner’s spamming in a high fee scenario *would* still be paying fees to do so in the form of opportunity cost from all the real fee paying tx they had to displace. If min fee for next block inclusion were $1 and i filled half a block i mined with 2000 $1tx, i’d return those fees to myself, but also lose out on $2k in fees compared to a rational honest miner.
I’m also highly suspicious anyone could make an argument that this is a significant problem or justification for a limited blocksize even if there were some well funded malicious miners.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:31:30
This weekend had an extraordinarily high fee backlog, as most of the mining power migrated to BCH during and extremely large swing in price. Later today, BCH is changing their difficulty algorithm to adjust more quickly, so swings like this shouldn't happen. The mining backlog is clearing now, fees are falling, and one would expect this same circumstance isn't likely to happen again.

In depth thorough analyses? Would you mind linking to a single one? Everything I google is just a paranoid screed about low tx fee spam, which doesn’t explain why blocks filled up with tx paying tens of dollars.
@_date: 2019-04-06 06:57:53


My point is that by definition, spam tx are *not* included when the going fees for inclusion in a block are "high", by definition, right? Are you saying spam can pay high fees and still be spam? I thought we were just referring to high volume, low fee tx which would/could easily eat up any capacity increase if fees remain near 0.
All that is to say, if fees remain persistently high (however we define that), isn't that clear evidence that real usage/demand has replaced all spam in blocks? If not, maybe I need to hear your definition of spam.
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:05:38
Scaling in my mind is about efficiency, more tx for the same resources. Increasing the blocksize isn’t scaling, it’s just dumb capacity, more tx for *more* resources. My concern is only that with the possible scaling improvements on the roadmap, there don’t seem to be anything other than incremental 10-40% type improvements. Fantastic, work towards them all! My concern is that BTC is poised to see 1000%+ growth in demand in the imminent 2-5 years, and that i don’t understand why some increase in blocksize, however small, isn’t on the table.
If you would, help me understand under what conditions either network or technology roadmap, it would be considered “really necessary” in your own estimation. I’d like to understand more people’s reasoning like yourself so i can better adjust my own.

If they’re not distinguishable from “real user” tx, then is there a distinction? It seems to me that any tx that pays a fee miners are willing to mine is by definition not spam, otherwise the basic premise of the system doesn’t work. 
Maybe we’re off on a tangent here, the point I was getting at originally is just to ask you why you didn’t seem to see high fees for real users as motivation to increase on chain capacity. Whether the tradeoff can be “safely” done is another question entirely, i’m just curious to understand your view of the right plan for capacity in principle, since I’m sensing it doesn’t involve raising the blocksize any time in the next few years, which seems too conservative to me.

Welcome to the crypto industry. With huge growth and huge gains come huge uncertainty, which requires allocating resources for items like this that might end up changing at the drop of a hat.

I’m totally on board with the “don’t just increase it because it’s possible, make sure it’s wise” logic that you’re describing, but help me out and put a little more meat on that description of “nice and heathy” if thats the metric you’re using for making that decision. Is it a certain dollar amount for average fees at full capacity? A certain satoshi bitrate? Personally, I see some merit in aimming for each block to pay some % of the total BTC supply for security longterm, totaling up to maybe ~2% of all the BTC in circulation, with some sort of adjustment to stick to that.
If you’re content with the capacity path the system is on now, help me understand where you see it going over the next 3-10 years or so. Do you  think the current state is not healthy, and if so, why do you expect leaving the base layer unchanged will improve things?
@_date: 2019-04-10 02:14:46
If you really see nothing remotely credible as a threatening substitute for BTC then i’d wager you have been too quick to assume the average user will dismiss the value proposition of some of them, but i’d also understand better why you seem to be satisfied with waiting a number of years at user growth rates in only the 10’s of % rather than 100s of %.
If i had to boil my quest for understanding down, it would just be to get an answer to “if you don’t think today’s conditions or technology merit planning for a bigger capacity increase, what would conditions or technology need to look like to change your mind?”
@_date: 2019-04-06 14:48:22
Wait, at least be consistent here: blocksize increases are a hopeless, slippery slope that won’t help reduce congestion, but an improvement like schnorr that improves scaling efficiency and effective blockspace by maybe 20-30% is a solution? Why is that?
I keep seeing you refer to spam as this self evident thing seemingly plaguing the blockchain, without being to explain how it’s different in anything but intention from normal tx. How much of the blockchain do you even believe is spam? 
Lastly, given that there are poised to be orders of magnitude more BTC users than there are today, why would the approach to capacity not be “as much as is safe” rather than to expect that because it can’t be a perfect solution for the entire problem that it shouldn’t be part of the problem at all?
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:27:03
He figures that actual resources in terms of data size aren’t lower in segwit format, even though blocks are allowed to be larger with a higher fraction of segwit tx, which is true.
Whether the actual increase in resources being used by blocks increasing in total size from 1.3MB up to the high estimate of 1.7-1.8MB with close to 100% segwit usage is a problem, I would say is debatable. Being too conservative with allowing the network to grow in capacity might be better than being to liberal, but it’s still a problem.
@_date: 2019-04-11 04:35:10


Again, what does this mean to you? If 1$ is nothing, what is for the cost of making a base layer is "paying for it"? I'm still trying to drill down to an answer of "if not now, then under what conditions would you deem it appropriate to increase the block size? The lack of a criteria to make this call is leading me to believe it may never be agreed upon, which would really set a low ceiling for how far BTC can spread.
Can we at least agree that more users are good, and if we could get the same or better security and decentralization with more users that would be a positive outcome for Bitcoin?


Then be conservative, and make approximations and predictions with the benefit of conservatism in mind. There's no reason we can't have a model in mind for the future number of users, the future use patterns, the future network capabilities or technology growth patterns, based on what we know today and what we can observe about the world.
If you're not confident making these projections yourself, from what source are you relying upon to come to the conclusion that it isn't safe or wise to plan for even a small increase in the forseeable future?

I’ll throw out a number: ~2% of the total supply of BTC every year. More than needed to secure BTC? Not enough?

\&gt; Pointless. Nothing can fix the mempool issues since spamming is possible. 
But surely there's some point where fees are high enough to discourage spam, but also becomming high enough to discourage whatever "legitimate" usage might be, yes? I'm not sure where that line is, but I'd wager it's in the single digit $ range.

@_date: 2019-04-09 15:52:52
That’s a lot of maybe’s and not a lot of data. What exactly is broken about the system now that something modest like a 10% annual blocksize growth rate starting next year couldn’t easily be swallowed by continual growth in hardware and scaling efficiencies in the code? Is it node count, or node cost? (I run a node)
 Or rather, what do you think the user base will look like in say 5 years if we do nothing? Will BTC persevere through the first competitor to go ahead and onboard 2x or 3x the number of users BTC has today? I predict that if it’s forced to stagnate in user growth while it’s still very small, fee pressure will eventually just be relieved by a shrinking user base, which puts us in an even worse position for security. BTC as a system isn’t stable as a tiny niche financial instrument, it either needs to grow out of being highly volatile or it goes to 0 in the longterm as an incapable store of value.
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:08:40
Sure, but the point is that "spamming" the network costs as much as real users are willing to pay for those tx in all cases. Do you see the existence of spam as some reason to avoid increasing onchain capacity to it's reasonable limits, when it's indistinguishable from real use?
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:11:12
So any negative monetary inflation (deflation) causes the economy to grind to a halt? The economy isn't going implode if inflation drops from 2% to -1%.
Do you know the typical ROI on capital investments in businesses? It's well &gt;7%. If it wasn't, why would businesses invest in new equipment, buildings and other capex instead of just putting their money in index funds of the stock market? A little bit of deflation might push some edge case low return/high risk investments to the sidelines in favor of saving, but it also helps sideline overly risky investing and asset bubbles. Is that a reasonable tradeoff? It's not an obviously "bad" tradeoff.
Put another way "as every economist knows" the world economy has functioned perfectly well with deflation in the past, like in the late 19th century when the US was still on the gold standard, seeing excellent, smooth economic growth with deflation from increases in productivity. It's not an unheard of concept.

@_date: 2018-03-01 22:01:48
Appreciate the breakdown, but I think you're mischaracterizing the arguments of BCH proponents. The concern has been that not that bitcoin could not scale due to the block size limit. Segwit increased the limit for the amount of raw data that could be included in blocks for tx that use segwit, by ~1.8-2.1x. 
The concern wasn't ever "we don't believe segwit allows for more txtx in a block" from any reasonable BTC critic (am I wrong about that? Would love to see counterexamples). Rather "1.8-2.1x is an inadequately small increase for Bitcoin's scaling needs at this time."
Personally I disagree with that "All on-chain satoshi's vision forever!!1!" line of thinking, and support erring on the side of conservatism with scaling while developing L2 solutions, but I think it's important to be fair about the views of people who disagree with us.

Let me back up and clarify that i’m not arguing for some massive 100%+ increase in blocksize, but rather to find some happy medium that can allow actual growth in the number of users while still creating enough security through fees to secure the network, which should absolutely be possible. 
Why not just target growth against something like average bandwidth improvement of ~17% per year as Lukejr once proposed? Surely you can see how if BTC saturates in users, even just for high value transfers, it will cap in value and eventually start shrinking as users of board to a system that can offer that, yes? Down the road, 10x the number of users paying 15% of the fee they would have otherwise still pays for more security and generates more consumer surplus than a no-growth system would.
If we want to collect data then great, but planning for no growth at all in order to try to generate a large fee market on a deliberately small user base seems like a recipe for failure in the face of a sea of other cryptocurrency fighting for user adoption.


Since we’ll never be able to, why do we even need to? If we can’t build a system that can be agnostic to what the intent of a tx is, hasn’t BTC failed? Spam paying market rate on fees within a total blocksize the network can process safely is just subsidizing security.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:02:11
Nah, it's way less complicated than that. BTC as an investment seems like it might be in it's despair phase, and for people who \*never did\* buy it feels like a fun time to come here and try to feel smart. It's just good ole' basic schadenfreude. Part of being on the internet with people : )

Can you explain what is fundamentally different about BTC that makes it not just the best investment (as I would argue), but the only legitimate investment?
It seems like all the best qualities are extrinsic advantages (development, recognition, hash power/market value, widest decentralization) that are true now, but could change with different conditions or be emulated elsewhere, rather than intrinsic qualities permanently unique to it in the longer term. I don’t see how rewarding earliest adopters a different amount changes anything fundamental, as you’re suggesting.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:19:54
Take a step back though and consider what even a $20k bitcoin would mean. That puts the value of all BTC out there at about $300B. This is still a very, very tiny amount compared to the potential many of the people investing in / hodling it are seeing as a potential future. If the \*only\* use case a trustless, uncensorable, finite, programable money like BTC ends up capturing is as a trusted reserve commodity, you might compare it to the value of all the gold in the world (\~$7500B). 
I'd argue BTC is bound to inevitabily either fizzle towards 0 or surpass it's previous highs substantially. Where one might place the "real" value depends most heavily on what you see the odds of each of those scenarios being, and on what time horizon. If you think there's just a 5% chance of BTC "succeeding" on a larger scale in the next decade or so, than \*even at $20k\* BTC would remain a good investment.
Price isn't something that can be ignored, and it matters a great deal to the people storing real value in crypto, but when people say "it's not about the price" I think what most people mean to say is that nowhere has the price, even at it's highs, reached close to what proponents would consider the real potential of the coin, or of the technology.

Bandwidth has mostly been accepted as the biggest limiting factor for increasing capacity on bitcoin, and while it’s not growing anywhere close to 100% every 4 years, it **is** [increasing globally]( year over year, closer to 10-20% on average. 
There are of course some people for whom any increase would present a challenge, but that group is becoming an ever smaller minority; where do you draw the line for when *any* increase would be both net beneficial and safe? I think An increase of some shape in the next few years is a great idea.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:36:23
Average blocksizes have been [0.8-0.9MB for about the last year]( that’s still &gt;50% of the potential capacity even if segwit usage continues to grow towards 100%. Bitcoin is still pretty small and it’s not hard to see a future where adoption eats up that remaining capacity, even if (or perhaps *especially if*) LN continues to improve, and a safe blocksize increase needs a lot of runway. I wouldn’t describe that as “plenty” of space.

Are you of the opinion that bitcoin is/should be considered "un-upgradeable" by hardfork? That feels like an extreme claim to me. Surely consensus can be defined as a point of agreement &lt; every single last individual using BTC, and there are improvements that are nearly strictly wins that would require hard forks, like (eventually) allowing the network to make use of resource improvements from technological advancements and make blocks bigger than today?

People aren’t going out to buy bitcoin in 2019 because they just read the whitepaper. They’re going out and buying bitcoin because someone they know told them about it or showed them what it can do, and that someone almost definitely knew if they were recommending Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:07:24
Can we tack on some numbers to that argument? I’d love to believe that you’re right, but if the goal is for BTC to be a globally relevant, and there are (at most) 5-10 million bitcoin owners/users today, and we *only* grow another ~50% in usage over the next 6-7 years up the current hard capacity limit, that paints a picture of BTC getting eclipsed by other technologies out there, and failing to reach the size it needs to have the kind of stability needed to achieve any of the long term goals i’ve ever heard for it. We are very early in the S curve for growth of a system like this, and scalability improvements like LN and Schnorr are fantastic, none of them claim to allow for increases in network capacity on par with what would be needed if the world “wakes up” or goes through any kind of a shock. Doesn’t keeping capacity locked for 6+ more years ensure most of the world will just use something else that has almost the same level of security and decentralization, but can support considerably more people?
On your second note, if the concern for growing capacity is the cost burden of nodes or bandwidth for the most vulnerable users, at what kind of fee level do you think those same people are “priced out” just the same? I’d say keeping capacity constrained and more quickly returning to $5-10+ tx fees is more limiting than planning for some kind of sensible 10-20% annual capacity growth plan, that keeps fees at a more reasonable level.

This is becoming my favorite expression lately: A lot of people are seeing people putting their values where their money is, when really what they've done is put their money where their values are.
Accusing people like Eric Voorhees of deliberately, nefariously, knowingly trying to "undermine and hijack" bitcoin holds no water with me. Not everyone who has different beliefs/opinions than you is evil/a bad actor. 
Bitcoin is still working out the practical means by which large changes are made, if at all, and we're just seeing how one of them might play out.
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:41:56
As an important caveat to this logic, the mempool being empty could *also* be a sign that bitcoin is failing to grow and gain/keep users. I don't think that's the case, but an empty mempool is not proof that "we won."
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:22:02
Oppose it maybe, but that didn’t *delay* it for years. It’s proponents released it less than a year before it activated, yet i hear this “years” of delay repeated often.

It's cleaner and less confusing, technically, to just say Segwit is a capacity increase, because that's what it is. It isn't clearly "a higher block size", as it changes the calculation process counted against the still unchanged MAXBLOCKSIZE of 1 MB.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:34:16
Exactly! But most users today don't run full nodes, ballpark 1%. I think the concern is, does bitcoin and "user" lite clients using SPV start to break down if &lt;0.01% of users run full nodes? Calculations suggest [it does.](

Well, sure, you might be able to use the military to coerce governments to change trade rules, but that's not the same as enforcing a currency value, which I don't see how the military is useful for. That Iraq prices it's oil in dollars is one thing, that the global market rate for oil in dollars remains constant or doesn't rise rapidly against other currencies if the US economy starts to falter is entirely another.

What you’re describing should be the end goal of LN user experience development, but i just don’t know if there’s anything that fits it just yet. Lots of progress in that direction over the last 6+ months though.

No, additional nodes add *redundancy*, another critical element of the Bitcoin system, but are not analogous to horizontal scaling. Nodes throwing more resources at the system, be it CPU, disk, or bandwidth is what horizontal scaling looks like. 
It seems to me like all successful systems have scaled both vertically through efficiency gains as well as horizontally when it was safe to do so and needed to meet user demand, i’m not thinking bitcoin is any different.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:25:30
Wat? It wouldn’t be survivable at all if mining fully ceased. People wouldn’t be selling coins because people literally couldn’t move coins with no mining. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:39:56
And is a great project! But also still one that requires onboarding of users, and that still adds *some* burden on the main chain for every new user of BTC. Having LN doesn’t mean it won’t be ever be both beneficial and safe to increase capacity on the main chain, does it?
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:45:04
Maybe the fees available in the pool weren’t high enough to entice them to include tx, in an attempt to get users to pay higher fees for more profit later. Maybe their code is bad and unreliable at optimizing which tx to include, or whether to include any vs orphan risk. Maybe it’s Asic boost. Maybe they just don’t like BTC and are willing to leave momey on the table to hurt it. Maybe they’re irrational and are acting on some other motivation that may not directly align with their own self interest.
Fortunately, Bitcoin is (and should be) resistant to any of the above.

Agreed. With segwit today, we have ~2MB worth of historical BTC tx, and we're using a little over half of it.

What is the mathematical definition of “secure” wrt Bitcoin? I would argue there isn’t one, and so there’s no such proof of anything. Hash functions might be “provably” secure, but they’re just one part of the BTC system.


I say this as a big fan of LN but here’s a security problem: all designs of LN I’m aware of effectively require BTC in channels to be held in hot wallets, contrary to all conventional crypto wisdom. This isn’t a criticism i can just go code a fix for myself, it might be a fundamental tradeoff of the system and worthy of real critical discussion.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:54:13
I agree with you! But it doesn't mean we can't be wrong either. The argument needs to be continuously revisited.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:31:06
Miners can get a great deal of fees from LN; LN channels need to be opened and closed on the main chain, and users willingness to pay for on chain tx increases with additional utility from those tx. More utility from onchain tx = higher potential tx fees.
Also, how high should fees even be, longterm, to sustain network security? 
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:00:45
Got it. Well, I’ve got a vested interest in BTC, and so would like to see it continue to grow and improve; one element of that is planning for capacity as prt of system health in the future.

I'm up-voting your insubstantial garbage post just because the replies to it are so well written.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:36:19
How is that easy to confirm or reject? Isn’t the leading theory behind the mempool emptying being that “spammers” have ceased? If so, transaction volume (which has fallen this year compared to last) wouldn’t be a good indicator either way. Blocks are still full just as they have been for months now, also not an indicator of growth through efficient usage or stagnation. Segwit use is climbing, but up only ~5% in tx% from a few months ago, also not a clear sign.
I disagree that this is an easy speculation to confirm/reject with a single metric.
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:12:53
A correlation between what and what? That doesn't address my question.

I think the common thread in our concerns is that we need a clearer way to define and measure "overwhelming support", without that, there will always end of some people claiming to have it and others claiming they don't, leading to this kind of infighting.
Similarly, a way for people to more publicly demonstrate ideas they support and ideas they don't, like [this tracker had shown.](
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:07:24
But they're following the incentives of bitcoin mining. If not confirming these tx leaves less money on the table than mining would by pushing users to not send approximately free tx, then either wait for another miner who happily will take your fee, or spend slightly more. This is rational action at 5sat/byte, in my view, even from a single significant pools perspective, no syndicate needed.

If you’re making money off the volatility, then you’re also helping to reduce it (sell when it’s high, buy when it’s too low) that’s valuable for the ecosystem if you can be good at it, so more power to you.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:07:58
First of all, I encourage you to keep being skeptical and ignore the people here reflexively lashing out at you for being critical of the thing they love/are financially invested in.
Second, I think it's going to go back up because the case for permissionless, uncensorable money is stronger than ever, and the technology is only improving. Scalability solutions are making steady progress, and while volatility like we've seen over the last year pushes out the time horizon that enough people will have faith needed in BTC to get it to "mass adoption", every time it goes through a bubble cycle like this one and lives it spreads more awareness, which gets more people working on it, which further speeds it's development, etc. There doesn't seem to be another credible candidate to fill the demand for a trustless money, and as the world continues to move through and towards turbulent times, I think BTC will get ever closer to "tipping". 
Nothing seems to have spurred recent losses other than a (continued) bursting of a hype cycle. I don't think the people woh have taken the time to really understand the tech and the need for it are cashing out, I think the in it to make a buck, impatient crowd is. That's all based on only anecdotal evidence, but it's definitely why I'm evaluating increasing my holdings today.

I'm sorry, but you don't know that selling 2k BTC from this one guy at 19k was the sole (or even primary) cause of the runup ending and retreating back to 16k. This whole sub is alive today with correlation=/= causation fallacy today.
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:17:19
That's one way to look at it, and I hope it's the correct way. Ever since segwit activated, fee's have been on the low side, in large part because of &gt;6 blocks / hour hashrate. I'll be curious to see if during the next tx rate spike, as fees start to climb, whether segwit adoption starts surging to help close the gap, or whether people just lament the fees understanding/being able to resolve the problem themselves through this improvement.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:12:42
This is a game of chicken to some extent, and you can't really solve the game theory of it by saying "Side B will definitely swerve away because side A is definitely going to plow straight ahead no matter what." The situation can look very different for the devs if support (and coin value) ended up with the 2x side after the fork.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:52:03
Do you think it would be helpful to ease proponents of the agreement out to start committing to a better point in the future when it *would* be prudent to continue increasing capacity? 
Whether it's a year out +/-, and whether it's a static increase up or a growing exponential increase (like the +17%/year under discussion) or something else, I think sharing a clear plan for future increases could go a long way to bridging the uncertainty these companies have about the future of the protocol their businesses depend on.
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:40:19
I doubt it will actually play out that way. People will get their BCH, and I’m not expecting people to permanently lose funds over this split either. Need to wait for some more clarity from exchanges at large.

The biggest flaw might be that it would be easier for attackers to use available, existing general purpose computing power (think NSA super computers) as an attack vector than to secretly take over a semiconductor fab to build their own asics.
Random algo for mining will still lead to professional miners, still clustered in areas with cheap electricity, they’ll just be back to using GPUs or FPGAs. What might be a better solution longterm is getting to the point where mining devices are actually used for their waste heat, in water heaters, space heaters, and others. This will happen with time and IOT infrastructure development i think, and is the kind of thing the company 21 is working towards.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:32:33
Fuck me? Lol, i wasn’t being toxic. If you can day trade and make money then you’re dampening volatility and aiding price discovery. If you try it and can’t, then it’s because you don’t have any valuable information to contribute to the market that isn’t already there and you deserve your losses.
I like to think I’m wise enough to know I’m one of the latter, and so I Hodl.
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:44:31


Absolutely true (if you filled a block with just the right kind of tx). But you could also have a 4MB block by increasing the MAXBLOCKSIZE to 4MB instead of 1MB. It isn't a technical feat that segwit allows larger block sizes; tx aren't any smaller, just better organized and with better incentives for use of blockchain space.


There were (and are) absolutely these kinds of rabbling criticism from the anti-segwit crowd. Notwithstanding the fact that there was no goalpost here to define success or failure, and that Segwit may be spreading slower than many of us hoped, it's disingenuous to just listen and respond to the most inane arguments from groups of people that disagree with you and ignore the most realistic, level headed, insightful criticism and claim some kind of victory. That was my whole disagreement with the OP that segwit growth was some kind of stick in the eye of anyone supporting BCH.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:12:52
One potential concern is that bitcoin hasn't shown the capability to upgrade via hardfork. Maybe it makes sense to start with a simple/small list of changes, since adding more is more likely to create concern over adoption/acceptance. I'm not saying 3 months is enough time, but it's very possible the signatories of the agreement think it is.
It seems like the only reason the core dev team hasn't already committed to a real HF at a safe distance in the future is they're worried any blocksize increase, even in a year or so, could be untenable for the network.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:36:06
Fair enough. I cruise around the r/ btc sub with some frequency, and find a lot of the vehement disagreement with Segwit or thinking they were lied to or whatever else stems in large part from confusion around these different terms, gotten into the habit of hammering on them whenever i get the chance : ).
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:30:02
This list is dumb. Bitcoin needs people capable of running functioning businesses in crypto if it ever wants to be relevant globally.  Lumping Brian Armstrong and the OB1 guys in with craig wright and jamie dimon is ridiculous and destroys all perspective. These people are going to advocate for their views, and they’d like to see bitcoin grow, and tried to lead the charge in a direction they thought they could establish concensus for.
They were wrong, and as we’re in the process of showing they don’t get to unilatterally decide. The community didn’t rally behind them longterm (as it seemed like they were doing when segwit was stalled and the agreement was signed), and so now they’re doing the sensible thing, letting their customers choose. I think we can trust them to do just that in the future, which is perfectly fine.
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:51:44
Not exactly; transactions aren't getting smaller, it's just that the way that their size is calculated against the limit that is allowing for more total transactions in a block. More tx, more data. Capacity increase, not a scaling increase.
Not trying to be pedantic, but confusion over these definitions creates fuel for toxic disagreement in the overall scaling debate.
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:38:00
This shows selling on the way up as well as selling towards the top, and then on the way back down. Why is the fact that there were also sales near what *turned out* to be the bottom proof of an intent to "crash" BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:47:00
The majority of Bitcoin users, maybe. But certainly not the majority of people actually seeking to own and use BCH, and they should really be the relevant parties in naming something, yea? The creators of the fork? 
Yes, the brand confusion is annoying, but this is exactly the kind of social pressure bitcoin can't control, and thus needs to be proven resilient to.

Well, the real network isn't just going to pop up overnight, it's going to start with a smaller userbase and grow. It seems reasonable to layout hypothetical use cases and network layouts.
Personally I think a hub heavy model makes perfect sense, as long as there can be close to perfect competition for being a hub.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:33:35
It doesn't need to be corporate control of bitcoin. And current bitcoin core developers wouldn't need to contribute to btc1 in the event segwit2x became the "winning" chain. Current core implementations would just need to merge the code for the increase into a new release to make core clients compatible with that chain.
The question is, would miners, exchanges, wallets adopting Segwit2x, and the market favoring it by buying it, in aggregate, over the non increase chain be enough of a referendum by the community to constitute a clear signal that that change *is* community backed? If so, would current developers still deem bitcoin failed/uninteresting and move on, or would they continue to to work to progress this exciting technology, now with larger block sizes? Or is that single parameter change enough to convince the current team that Bitcoin had become uninteresting / not worth pursuing? I personally think the former is more likely, though I recognize significant risk of the latter.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:06:29
Blockstream absolutely does depend on the growth and success of Bitcoin as well. The post above was pointing out that some firms stand to benefit more from direct on chain capacity gains more than others.
That being said, he also seems to be missing the point that companies that *do* depend more directly on on-chain capacity growth also have the same "conflict" in supporting S2x as the "conflict" of companies and people less dependent on it opposing it.
I think people too often assume people are putting their values where their money is, when really they've just put their money where their values are.

Segwit changes what it means to be a block. Segwit blocks can hold ~2MB of today's transactions in a single block, it's just that some of it is stored outside the original container. Segwit is functionally a block size increase.

Mining a big block to fulfil an agreement is easy and extremely likely to happen. Continuing to mine that chain is the unlikely part, and it isn’t some kind of coin flip event. There’s either enough support and it thrives and overtakes BTC, or there isn’t and it dies out. Futures prices showing the latter very clearly.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:18:18

I'm not sure you're catching the actual allure of something like crypto to potential users. Govs already have their own versions of digital money. Why doesn't China, or countries in the middle east use USD? It would be WAY more convenient for them in lots of ways. The answer is that they don't trust the US government to manage monetary supply in a way that benefits them. The same as it would be if any government tried to create a crypto. If it doesn't require trust in them, how is it better than BTC, or desireable for either party? If it does require you to trust them, it's just an inefficient USD.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:18:58
Really don't think more than a single example of these is more than is needed to demonstrate he's been more "involved" than you and I put together in advancing awareness and use cases for crypto for [many years now]( Bit Instant, SatoshiDice, Coinapult, Shapeshift. Crypto needs way, way more people like this guy if it's ever going to be used by more than a few million people, which is the only way it stays interesting. It's possible to double the block size from what it is today without blowing up everything that makes bitcoin interesting/valuable, and it's possible to hold that view without being a butthurt leech of a villain. This guy in particular has earned at the very least the benefit of the doubt on this one.
That being said I think S2x in November is a bad idea and don't support it, I just understand how others could.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:26:06
Shapeshift’s existence doesn’t motivate the creation of scamcoins, the fact that there are greedy fools out there who want to buy them does. Shapeshift is meeting a market demand, that’s all. If you have any evidence of him”pumping” scamcoins or getting kickbacks lets discuss that, but i haven’t seen any.
Forking everything wildly doesn’t create more profit unless the resulting coins have more value, and pointless forks tend to destroy value, especially to a portfolio of existing coins. If you think Eric doesn’t personally own a large stash of BTC and sincerely want to do what he thinks is best for the longterm value of the coin, then i guess i can’t prove you wrong, but thats my belief.
All this being said i think 2x in Nov is a bad idea at this point.

Sure, gripe on them for supporting BCH, but the real problem isn’t them rigging anything, its that the market isn’t mature enough to have multiple firms capable of producing the same level of efficient asics, combined with having access to extremely subsidized electricity.

It’s really just not as simple as “bad actors.” One person’s malicious, shameful attack on the protocol is another persons useful, early stage stress test to improve protocol resiliency. Bitcoin needs to be designed to be resistant, ultimately, to capricious, random, or irrational behaviours from individuals in the system.
Or, put a different way, “Don’t hate the Player, Hate the Game.”
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:58:12
This seems like a great approach in helping to improve scalability, and could go a long way in mitigating risk from block size increases. 
Can anyone let me know if there's anything missed here? What risks are there to building an approach like this into the reference client to greatly improve initial sync and/or resource requirements for running a full node in the future?
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:35:10
No, this is a different equilibrium than BCH. There was an incentive there to mine at a loss because it would activate the EDA and lead to profitability, in a matter of hours.
When this split occurs, both coins will have static difficulty identical to just before the split. It wont make sense to mine either coin unless you think it will eventually be successful; get 100+ blocks in so mined coins can be spent, and continue to have value at that point. If you’re one of only a few miners on a chain, coming from current difficulty, you’re most likely not going to even get to that point. If a lot more mining support doesn’t join you, it’s going to take WEEKS to get to that point, and if after a few days that doesn’t start to happen, why would you continue? Users that see that are only going to snowball the price of the lesser valued chain into the ground.
With the split happening like it is, game theory suggests one of these chains won’t make it to it’s next difficulty adjustment. There will be a question of whether miners can try to band together to change users minds, by scaring value out of the old chain by not mining it initially, so the only question is are miners more committed and stubborn about 2x than users are about 1x? Im betting on the user group so far.
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:25:55

Hmm, so literally 1 MB max block size forever then, otherwise it isn't bitcoin? That may not prove to be tenable at a certain point, as names tend to exist in popular perception more than from defined authors. If there REALLY gets to be a clear super majority will, and people, users, miners, exchanges, developers start calling their popular fork bitcoin, not much any minority can do. 
No one can force you to run a ruleset you don't agree with, but nobody can force anyone to use a specific terminology, either. Will be curious to see how this all plays out down the road.

I think you and I are saying the same thing. At the time of posting, the futures for the S1x chain are valued at ~3x the S2x chain. I don't think miners will be able to rally around mining a chain worth less and keep defectors from mining the more profitable chain to the point of shifting all that value into the lesser valued chain, and it will quickly collapse further. 
Agreement signers for whom it is important to "stick to their word" will have been able to honor it in the fullest by creating the split, and can then resume profit seeking behavior by mining the highest valued coin (looking like S1x now) and the other will quickly die. Referendum over.

Don't lump everyone who thinks we should have a blocksize increase of some reasonable amount, at some reasonable point in time, with supporting 8MB, HF, right now at all costs. As u/paleh0rse said, this is a completely rational debate and there's room to have an opinion that there is some safe level of blocksize increase that's possible.

Personally I too am anxious to see Segwit functionality added, and was surprised it's taken as long as it has, but the above is really the best way to answer my complaint, haha. I don't code, and haven't paid for anything, and so shouldn't complain.

Thanks for the detailed write up. I’m still not seeing how replacing the core team with someone “they can better control” is either a likely agenda piece for the many diverse signers who have profited greatly so far under core, and who don’t all have aligned interests other than the longterm success of BTC, or how any element of the agreement could coerce the current team out of power, other than by convincing them to voluntarily drop out.
But i agree with all of your other points, and am not in a hurry to disregard the current consensus amongst the developers as to what is technically advisable with the network, or to change the process of decision making. I’ll continue to think on it, which i imagine will be easy with a lot of discussion in the coming month.

From my understanding, the argument against 2x isn’t that that strain from more capacity would be an apocalypse, its that it’s happening too quickly and the network at large isn’t ready for a smooth hard fork, that it isn’t neccesary now because we’re far from utilizing segwit capacity anyway, and that the overall push to make this change runs so counter to the standard process of generating concensus (and is being done without hard replay protection). That last one in particular is the thing that sold me against it. It seems certain that people will lose money over this.

More scaling, sure, Schnorr, lightning, others. But given that hard forks take a long time to activate safely (let alone how long they take to discuss, agree upon, code and test), and the main argument against hard fork scaling increases is that they take a long time and place too much of a burden on full nodes, giving some guidance now, rather than "we'll continue to evaluate", may be very constructive. 
I'd agree that it hasn't been critical to have a larger blocksize before the one with segwit. But I also think we should be planning and committing to real, resource-based capacity increases that go live in the next 24 months.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:21:02
Came here to say this.

Sometimes, you need to take a step back, take a deep breath of fresh, non-internet cynical air. Sometimes people put their values where their money is, like you're accusing Eric of doing. But in my experience, people who have been passionately involved in exciting, risky, revolutionary technology since the early days, have launched multiple successful enterprises with it, not to mention owned the early currency itself, are more simply putting their money where their values are instead.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:06:56
It's not free money; it's value from an original chain split across tokens on two chains post fork. The value of BTC dipped significantly at the release of BCH, just like stocks drop when dividends are paid. It didn't seem that was because the split happening and the market getting rid of a lot of uncertainty helped lead to a continuing rally in BTC.....which looks like the situation we're in now.....maybe it is free money. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:46:21
My concern, and I suspect the concern of people who think s2x isn’t totally crazy, is that we still don’t have anything approaching a timeline, and haven’t ever demonstrated the ability to hardfork as an upgrade. How to decide what to include, how to confirm if we have “concensus” on making the change, are also issues that have been discussed for years now, without narrowing towards a conclusion. I am indeed afraid that without a committed date, we do risk pushing it out indefinitely.
If thats not the case, we need much more than a mention of it in IRC. In my opinion, we need the core team, who have so far effectively shown concensus on opposing s2x, to better form and communicate concensus on what the plan forward should be instead, as the most effective means of disarming s2x impact.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:35:52


Fundamentally what this doesn't factor in is that people value consumption in the present more than consumption in the future. Everyone's utility curve is different, but if deflation is in the ~1-2% range, it's easy to see how $1 worth of consumption today can still easily be preferred to $1.02 worth of consumption a year from now, leading to continued spending even of a currency like BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:33:01


This is crazy reductionist. From that logic it follows that Not supporting Even Smaller Blocks means supporting centralization. There's no reason the current size is a magic number, it's only at where it is because of inertia. There's room to be a reasonable person  who supports the ideals of decentralization and still think we should be increasing capacity in the near term.
Now, whether doing that in Nov with a replay-protection-less HF is the right way to do that, is another discussion. But the above "villainy" is nowhere near as black and white as you're describing it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:46:15
Please consider though that what you're describing is defaulting on US debt, which has never happened in modern history. Defaulting on debt is a great way to lose that ultra high value "reserve" status throughout the world, which is the kind of thing that makes low cost borrowing through treasuries and massive deficit spending possible in the first place. 
No amount of military force can prop up the value of a currency or the force of an economy, probably not even if we literally started becoming pirates and plundering other countries for assets.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:09:39
I agree that having all the current devs leave for other projects would be a disaster, and the risk of that is one of the biggest reasons i’m against S2x at this point. But please recognize that there’s some circular logic going on here: s2x is a corporate takeover because it would take away control from the core devs, but it would only take control from the core devs if they decide to leave en masse because they refuse to accept modifying core with this feature change *”because it’s a corporate takeover”*.
If this feature were brought about organically a year ago and safely activated today with concensus, the broad agreement is that bitcoin would be able to function with today’s technology even with 4 MB worth of block data every 10 min. The concern is that that’s still a lot, and its being done too quickly, without replay protection. 
I just don’t buy this corporate takeover logic. That being said, s2x can’t happen without people valuing the capacity increase coin more highly than the previous one, and that can’t happen without broad enough economic concensus. It doesn’t seem like that will happen, but it does look like we’re going to test it.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:36:09
I get the benefits from using it immediately. If fees are so low that other users and businesses can't be bothered to make use of it themselves, then it doesn't sound like there's much of a problem.
That being said, I'm surprised uptake hasn't happened faster/wider, and if fees rose back to &gt;$1/normal tx on a continuous basis and Segwit adoption didn't rapidly start to increase, I'd admit to being wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:34:55
You're mistaken about this; the blockchain is growing *linearly*, for this very reason. As luke pointed out above, assuming 2 MB full blocks for an entire year, the blockchain grows about 100GB. Storage can keep up with that, and bandwidth and other hardware challenges can too.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:00:19
Sorry, I think I was unclear in my metaphor. On bitcoin, UASF supporting nodes were &lt;10% of the public node count (if I'm not mistaken?). By "the gun shooting", I don't just mean the code triggering and orphaning blocks that don't signal segwit after august 1st, I mean that actually having a meaningful impact on the network. The collection of UASF nodes might reject those blocks, but would that change miner behavior if none of the exchanges, wallets, etc were running nodes doing so? I'm not so certain.
I see the value in a push for UASF, but if it doesn't get critical mass (&gt;50% of network nodes, including some meaningful economic ones), does the movement have teeth, or does it just help make it clear that there are users who care strongly about that issue and make community sentiment to miner/etc more clear so that they can voluntarily make the change?
My read on Segwit's delay was that it was based much less on conspiracy or wrongheaded notions that it would somehow lessen profitability, and more on apathy and an unwillingness to take a clear stand on the future technical direction of the protocol, but I know there are many who would disagree with my assessment there.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:53:56
This is really correct. There is circular logic to the argument: S2x is a corporate takeover of bitcoin because it will force out the core devs, and the core dev will all choose to opt out of continuing work on the project because S2x is a corporate takeover of Bitcoin.
There are plenty of other reasons to oppose S2x (the network doesn't appear to be at all ready based on node count/versions, exchanges haven't explained how they're planning to support a fork without clean replay protection, capacity from Segwit is available and underutilized because fees are way low again). These are good reasons to oppose taking the risk of doing it, but if it does run, and the market does support it (something miners / CEOs can't force), then merging it with Core *because it had economic consensus* and continuing on with further developments should be a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
That being said, I think it's a bad idea right now and don't support it, it's just not the apocalypse some are making it out to be. The network can't scale on chain indefinitely, but it could handle blocks growing up to full ~4MB worth of data over the next year or two.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:00:29
That's right, no ONE person or entity does, but it has to start somewhere. It's not a crime to try to get people to support increasing the block size as long as you're not coercing them, that's the only way to get to consensus in the first place! But that's a high bar to hit, especially when what you're advocating for is a bad idea for lots of reasons. Xapo advocating for their point of view in their press release doesn't matter in the face of the broader community advocating for theirs.
There are people out there who DO see Segwit2x as a network upgrade, not an attack. It's absolutely people's right to boycott them if they please for not supporting their views, but it seems crazy to me to go so far as to vilify them over being wrong about thinking they have majority support of the community because they *had* close to unanimous miner support. We'll all see together exactly how much that matters for making protocol changes.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:34:42

@_date: 2017-10-19 18:47:31
Poor execution of an idea doesn’t make it a scam. It’s nearly a 1 issue repo, and if it creates the fork successfully without breaking anything else (a fairly low bar) it will be said to have been a technical success.
Jihan being “well known” for takeover attempts doesn’t make this a scam. There are real scams put there, where people are lied to and tricked; this is just one big giant difference of opinion on the right technical path for bitcoin and what are acceptable decision making processes for protocol changes. It’s going to fail, but you’re attributing much more malice to it’s motivations than is necessary with no evidence. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:41:13
Please [read the wording]( for yourself; OP is pulling in a sentence out of context, and I think is over-reacting to a mostly neutral statement.


"that may create another fork in the Bitcoin network" is not an inaccurate or misleading statement, though I understand the concern over suggesting that continuing to mine the current ruleset creates a fork vs. modifying the rule set creates a fork.
Forks result from disagreement; and their actions are to support where hash power goes, which will go where value goes. This is a non-issue.

Not talking about now; we're in agreement  a 2x HF isn't needed now, we're disagreeing about whether one is needed *ever*.


Not disagreeing about that either. But a multi-layered solution isn't mutually exclusive to adding capacity to the first layer, right? One would expect a doubling of the base layer at some point would effectively double the capacity of the more-scalable upper layers as well. Would you agree it's technically possible in the forseeable future without endangering the properties of the network?

Capacity has changed; as segwit adoption grows, the bitcoin network will slowly be able to handle higher transaction volumes (~5-6 transactions per second at full segwit use, up from ~3 transaction per second previously).
Witness data isn't "removed", it's still included in every transaction sent, it's only been reorganized, with a change in what data "counts" against the block limit. Whether nodes continue to store it or begin to prune witness data more aggressively is another good discussion, however.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:55:27

@_date: 2017-10-05 16:39:19
Maybe you can wait, but the remaining 5-10% of miners probably can’t. Even waiting the 20 weeks or so for a first adjustment would mean mining a coin with suddenly 10% of previous capacity, likely plummeting in price below the point of profitability after a few weeks if it became clear this is the new normal. Which leads to a death spiral as more miners drop out, readjust moves further into the future. 
A more likely outcome would be a hardfork difficulty adjustment, which has its own concerns.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:21:24
This is an extremely important point. Descriptors like “secure” and “decentralized” are qualitative measurements,  to be subjectively interpreted by (lack of quantitative) definition. That leaves open the room for differing opinions from two different rational people, based on different values. 
Rejecting opinions like this (or others, as about how scaling should proceed) isn’t “combatting FUD”, it’s fanaticism.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:55:06
However, an increase from here actually will take a long time to safely plan, and having room to fill up another ~70% of current block size is great, but may go very quickly, on the order of ~12-15 months. Thats about how long it would take to get agreement on, code, test, and safely deploy an upgrade across the network; we shouldn’t rest on our laurels with segwit, we should be pushing to plan the future now.
There are other improvements that could be made, rather than strictly block size increasing, but regardless this extra space won’t last forever.

Interesting ideas, and long term you may be right. Longterm we may not need exchanges at all, if payment loops from salary-expenses-business expenses-salaries can be closed in crypto. But we're a ways off from longterm, and if we want to get to longterm, then we actually need to incentivize the development of getting there. That means onramps to crypto through fiat exchanges that are interoperable with the existing financial system. That means wallet software the non-geeks can use, and use easily/safely, to companies that can profit from pushing mining from CPU--&gt;Asics and beyond, to grander ideas improving functionality of the network from places like Rootstock/Blockstream.
If we could somehow drive out all of these people, Bitcoin might get to the future you describe eventually through responsible open source development and stewardship, but it won't be more than a blip on history, because something else will do it (or something reasonably close to it, with some imperfections) much faster.
The internet would have taken much longer and possibly turned out much differently without those early walled gardens. They were great for the internet development, and when their usefulness ends, so will they, just like firms in bitcoin or any other field do.

Sorry for the term confusion; s1x was my descriptor for the side of the post fork chain that represents the current ruleset, vs s2x which will be the side of the fork with the blocksize increase. It looks like bitfinex will keep BTC ticker symbol for the former, and use B2X for the latter.

Yes, if the vast majority moves to 2x, which is a concern, since so many of them seem to be suggesting the will with the blocks they are mining now. Users/core also agree with this being bad, they just think they can prevent it/stop it from being long lasting. Can they? Personally i hope so. But i think this is going to come down to the real controllers of bitcoin, the economic majority. If exchanges don’t make it easy to buy/sell 2x, then it’s dead. If they do, and the user base in the market makes it less valuable than 1x, then it’s also dead.

The way segwit2x is set up, without an EDA, should guarantee that only a single coin survives completely out of the fork. There will be 2 chains, both with the same high difficulty, and unless the market price of each at the fork is exactly equal, miners are going to have a bigger incentive to mine either one or the other. That hashrate and chain progression is likely to snowball value into that side, and death spiral the other. I will be very surprised if both coins make it to a difficulty readjustment post fork.

Yes, exponential increase. Most systems in nature grow exponentially; population, use of new technologies, and certainly technological capabilities. [Here is a BIP]( for an exponential growth scheme from luke-jr, widely seen as one of the absolute most conservative plans for bitcoin capacity expansion, calling for 17% annual exponential growth, starting in 2024.
You mentioned you support *never* hard forking to increase blocksize, but how do you feel about a proposal like this? If you still think it’s too aggressive, where is it you seen bitcoin’s future in 10, 20 years?

I mean, 2.6% more capacity is 2.6% more capacity, whether it’s one block or weeks of them. It means the mempool empties 2.6% faster. This isn’t a whole lot, but i think thats because we haven’t needed a whole lot.  What i’ll be curious to see is what impact actual fee pressure (not the &lt;50 sat/byte clearing in next block or two we’re seeing now) has on the rate of segwit adoption in easing that pressure.

Let's be realistic here: Discussion and planning around crypto happens predominantly on the internet. As long as the internet is full of people, and people continue to be self righteous, stubborn, and attention seeking, *with money at stake*, we'll have a toxic atmosphere. We can't use toxicity as an excuse not to push progress, or fear that other parties will attempt to "hijack" progress attempts for their own goals.
If the core team consensus is that we don't need another capacity increase in the next 18-24 months, which appears to be the case, then let's be clear about that, but let's also make it a serious priority to get clear about when we *do* need an increase. Obviously thats hard to predict, but I think the leaving the roadmap open and ambiguous leaves more risk than committing to something, even something conservative, now does.

If you control your private keys (as you would if you're holding coins in a QT wallet), then your wallet file should also be accessible by software that recognizes the 2x fork; the problem is that you likely couldn't do that through Core software, which won't see 2x as a valid chain. If you wanted/needed to, you could load your wallet file into software which can recognize the 2x chain, though at this point it's not completely clear where that would be from.

Can't do that, they're too easy to fake : /. That's one of the bigger reasons nodes can't be incentivized with a share of the mining reward, there isn't an effective "proof-of-real-node" that can be used. If node count became a real, hard metric agreed upon to make decisions, we'd start to see "voting" nodes spun up way in excess of the total current node count.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:42:59
But the technical points in discussion aren’t objectively worse, like in your example, only arguably worse. “When is the right time/amount for additional resource based capacity to get added to the network” is a complex question, and there are stakeholders who honestly believe, without malice, that the “best solution” is more capacity sooner, rather than a “more perfect” solution at an indeterminate time down the road.

I'm watching, and listening, and while I don't think S2x is a good idea as implemented now, I don't think it's being done with bad intentions, I really, really don't. I don't see the entity taking over, I don't see how their actuals in any way permanently wrest control of the future code developments, and I definitely don't see the people who anyone is suggesting are capable of actually running further development after it's been "taken over". I just see misguided business people trying to break what was seen as a socially driven stalemate over how to scale bitcoin.
What I ALSO don't see is any bad intentions from the core dev team, as I sometimes see claimed. And I trust the expertise that has gotten bitcoin as far as it has, and in particular the unanimity in resistance to it seems like a strong indicator. That and the replay protection problem put me solidly in No2x territory, I just disagree with some of the other reasons argued for that position.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:33:38
My concern is the approach with no replay protection; BCH had a clean split with a different token one could offload, which may not be so cleanly possible with the 2x fork. There may just be confusion, without an obvious way to vote with your wallet.

@_date: 2017-09-29 00:31:43
S2x doesn't neutralize core dev control over anything; it would just require merging the block size HF increase into their repo. Nobody would need to run btc1 going forward (other than whatever hypothetical critical players it would need to somehow be a success), barely anyone runs it now. Everyone else running core could keep doing what they're doing.
The problem is whether the means by which that happens leads to some or all of them *choosing* to stop contributing, but that particular decision isn't being forced on them by anyone.
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:33:18
I've read your points, and I really feel like I'm not glazing over your argument. I understand the incentive for miners to align and change behavior in advance of actually being punished by UASF enforcement if it becomes clear that would be the outcome. I'm just questioning the cause/effect you seem to be assuming rather than demonstrating with regard to the particulars of BIP 148.
Supporting Segwit != supporting the specific UASF effort. There were obviously many people with a preference for Segwit but not a strong enough conviction to actually reject miners blocks that didn't support it by a certain date, as reflected in the (I insist still relevant to discussion) node count. 
If BIP 148's exclusive definition of success was Segwit activating before August 1st, then sure, I agree it was successful, but that's such a trivially narrow definition as to be meaningless, because it completely fails to evaluate whether it's stated goal *was going to happen anyway*. It follows the same logic as saying "i have a rock on my shelf for the purpose of ensuring the sun will rise tomorrow, and because it did, my rock was successful in it's purpose."
I definitely can't prove the UASF movement *didn't* have a big effect, or even that Segwit would have happened without it, because one can't prove a negative. It sounds like you see the NYA as the direct result of UASF, but there were many, many people pushing to find a compromise on the scaling effort for a very long time, and avoiding a possible orphaning on non-supporting blocks as of august 1st is far from the only motivation to seek that compromise or sign that agreement. I don't think it's good science to draw the conclusion in this particular case that the UASF effort was directly responsible for Segwit activating, but again, I look forward to seeing how such UASF efforts are used in the future.

Segwit by itself is not a practical increase to 4MB, all reasonable estimates of normal transaction mix put it at ~2MB worth of pre-segwit tx volume. 4MB is just the upper bound and possible "attack" vector for anyone trying to bloat blockchain growth, or for some future where all tx are much more complicated and witness heavy. Suggesting it is a capacity increase to 4MB as is is disingenuous.
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:32:38
I understand what you're saying; soft forks tighten the ruleset which is why they're backwards compatible, hard forks relax it which is why they're not.
With that in mind, are you sticking then with the position that any hard fork into the future to make any changes will need to be called something other than just plain Bitcoin? I'm not saying I have a clear solution for how determining what "bitcoin" is going forward in the event of a fork like this, but is "bitcoin can never hard fork upgrade" really an acceptable conclusion to you?

It’s highly unlikely that both chains will make it to a difficulty adjustment after forking. This is an unstable equilibrium, the one with even a little more value/hashrate is likely to start snowballing into both; adjust (downward) sooner, continue on. Just like BCH would be dead without the EDA, so will one of these high difficulty chains.
The big remaining question is does hashrate follow value faster than value follows hashrate? I think that it will, even with a congested network, but i’m maybe only 85% sure. I know economic majority is supposed to dictate where value is in bitcoin, but this will be the first real test of it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:18:49
Sorry, let me clarify my view: I don't think there will be two chains after the fork that both reach their next difficulty adjustment. Remember when BCH forked? How many blocks were mined on that chain immediately post fork, once it's market price settled around ~10-20% of BTC? How many would have been mined if there was no EDA? I predict miners are going to collapse on a single chain within the 7 days after the fork. Either S2X will die (likely) or *there won't be any more 1MB blocks*. I'm only talking about that unlikely outcome, where the option isn't stick with a minority 1MB chain or merge 2x, it's totally leave bitcoin by default, or merge 2x compatible code into their client so that it can still run on a network.
Maybe a PoW fork would be better than doing that, that's a reasonable point, but that's roughly the same as entirely leaving the ecosystem. Fortunately, it doesn't look like it will come to that.
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:04:52
It's only "getting rid" of core in the sense that all the devs could choose to quit if they want to? Well, thats true today as well, but nothing forces them out if they decide to just change their minds. Ironically, the theory that core devs aren't bluffing when they say they would quit if there was a capacity increase tends to be supported by the r/btc people who believe the key figures on the team are a bunch of filthy liars.
If they didn't leave, I don't see anything driving confidence away from the core implementation if they merged a hypothetical "winning" 2x chain code and continued to build from there, so it wouldn't matter whether the btc1 with it's 1 issue repo allowed outsiders in or not.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:25:46
Is it written somewhere that the chain with the highest developer support is the "real" chain? How would one measure that, exactly? Is it quantity of people, or numbers of commits? What about what users (including miners) think if developers disagree with the vast majority of the community (they don't this time, but might in the future). The point is all these definitions are new, still forming, and up for reasonable disagreement.
I think you and I have the same opinion, I'm just disagreeing on whether there is any objective means to come to a conclusion, because if there isn't, it's reasonable to cut Xapo and everyone else in favor of a higher block size some slack while we beat back their proposal. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:50:30
Sure; so many of the developers involved in BTC are a principled bunch, and are in it for the world changing impact of the technology and being part of the community, and so I imagine some of them would leave, which would be a significant loss. But it also makes sense, tactically, to say you'd quit, and make this threat, as a means to support the movement against this change, which they don't agree with. 
My point is just that nothing about S2X, assuming it were successful, "forces" core developers to stop, or from anyone else from following their continued work in Core if they opted to continue it through support on the S2X chain.
Let's be clear about one thing, we don't have an effective means to measure (or even define) community support. Bitcoin isn't a dictatorship, but it isn't a democracy either. I think in practice, the only measure of support is where people put their faith in the value of a token; which is to say, IF S2x manages to devour the value of the original chain, that is the *definition* of having community support. It wouldn't mean that random businesses were able to ram anything through, it would have meant that they accurately measured the will and interest of the users they represent.
Do you think if the split happened today and all exchanges supported BTC/S2X trading pairs that more money would flow into S2X than BTC? I'm doubtful that that will happen, but if it did, I would have to admit that the community supported that direction.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:39:48
Part of the disruption and craziness is how there isn't clear replay protection on the new fork, which means it's a lot hard to have clean access to your coins on both resulting forks with any of the currently available means of holding/moving coins. Exactly how this access will work out on people holding coins through Core, through phone wallets like mycelium/Breakwallet, through accounts on exchanges, etc, is all still unknown. This pile of uncertainty only a few weeks out of fork activation is the biggest reason I'm opposed to doing the fork now.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:15:12
What happens when you can't get consensus? Is the default in that case to stick with status quo? That's the No2x position.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:06:13
Well, they're not binding, but that's not the same as meaning nothing. The other 80% of hash rate still went through the trouble to add them, but not the trouble to make any kind of statement like F2Pool saying they don't intend to support it through mining the fork.
The bigger question will be how the exchanges handle it. I'm really starting to think for making decisions about protocol changes, hash rate promising one thing doesn't matter, and node count doesn't matter; the only way to decide is to let the market vote by offering exchange across multiple competing options and see what people place value in and what they don't.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:23:15
But ultimately, you need both. If the fork happens and no nodes/users support 2x, it's going to be very difficult for that coin fork to retain value, and thus retain the miners who are signaling support for it now.
However, if the fork happens and no miners support 1x, and the blockchain grinds to a halt, it's going to be very difficult for the original coin/fork to retain value, and thus retain users/nodes who are showing support for No2x now.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:13:59
So, forward looking, every hardfork (or even potentially softfork) change will require a new token title? These change concensus rules, and even if a vast, vast majority agree with those changes, should we expect to ditch the name bitcoin? Not trying to twist anything you’re saying here, just really trying to understand your view of how BTC should progress in the coming years.
I don’t think anyone is suggesting repeated swaps between asset names the second one has a rally. But i also think it’s clear that we won’t have two chains being mined a month out of this fork, at least not with the same PoW. There’s no EDA, so the market really will get to decide, and the economic majority (hodlers) will get to choose which ruleset to put value in, as they always have. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:43:32
That depends on the pricing outcome of the resulting forks. Miners may commit to the NYA as signaled, maybe even with all their hash power (big maybe). But if the exchange price plays chicken with them and doesn’t value the new coin more highly than the old, there will inevitably be a shift back to go where value is.
I think for the non hard line ideological miners, 2 coins, no EDA will mean an unstable equilibrium, and the market is likely to collapse on one or the other.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:36:36
Yea, I basically agree. But I can see and understand the opposing argument. I think a HF increase should be planned and committed to now from the core team, however, it's just that November is too soon.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:46:06
I don't support 2x in November, but I'll take a swing at the opposing argument. We need bigger blocks because this state of fees is temporary. Technologies like Bitcoin don't typically enjoy slow, predictable linear growth, they move in fits and spurts. We're not currently very far, in exponential terms, from slamming into the max again, as we're at ~60% of max capacity even assuming segwit adoption goes to 100%.
Hardforks haven't yet been done successfully to adapt bitcoin, and it's theorized that the only safe way to do them is with a great deal of planning and time, which means we need to start on them long before they are desperately needed. There are other promising solutions like LN, side chains, and other scaling improvements like Schnorr that can help mitigate this problem, but those have their own uncertainties, and even their advocates aren't suggesting larger blocks will never be needed. 
Having blocks average size increase from ~2MB (upper end only with full segwit tx) to 4 MB comes with it's own risks/strains on the network and nodes, but these risks are arguably lesser than the risks that inaction leads to stagnation.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:37:29
What scam did you expose? People flipped out over a non issue in the syntax used in a press release. “...that may cause another fork in the bitcoin network.” Is an accurate, and reasonably neutral if somewhat clumsily worded.

@_date: 2017-10-03 22:04:26
But the argument that it is a corporate takeover rests at least in part with the notion that it would “fire the core devs”, which isn’t something that would happen unless the core devs all decide to fire themselves. Btc1 is a 1 issue repo, IF the fork goes through with current miner support, and IF the market bought into the 2x coin post split (big ifs), that doesn’t mean everyone would choose to run btc1 nodes over core IF the core team just released a version compatible with the 2x chain, right? 
I think there is circular logic to the “corporate takeover” analysis; i really dont think signers like coinbase want to see all the progress you listed stop or the current dev team leave, they just don’t think the risks of scaling now are as damaging as others do. 
I don’t support doing 2x now, but if the economic majority decided to put more value into it than the current path, i don’t think that spells the end of BTC either.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:26:28
I believe btc1 triggered a flag day (for November) based on BIP4 which activated Segwit. There's no longer any relevant miner signaling which will determine any change in the code, all the signaling is just a social signal.

It’s not a strawman argument, because I’m the one making it, right now. Did any of the major exchanges run BIP148? Payment processors? Which nodes rejecting miners blocks would they have cared about, exactly, with such a small % of nodes showing UASF compatibility? 
I don’t see evidence that as you described, there was an economic majority supporting UASF, just that there was enough support of segwit itself to finally tip to get an agreement to signal for it. The fact that NYA happened with enough time to start triggering a MASF in advance of august 1st left us without a real test of the impact of the game theory you’re describing. Did it play out differently in litecoin or vertcoin?
You say BIP 148 had the sole aim of activating segwit before august 1st, but the fact that it happened is evidence of correlation, not causation. I’m not saying that UASFs can’t work, just that I’m dubious of this one’s real impact, given the level of support and buy in from big players it had. I’ll be very curious to see how this tool is employed in pushed for user back features in BTC in the future, and maybe see if there’s something else that i’m missing.

@_date: 2017-10-03 23:12:51
I mean, I've heard that too, but everyone also heard that a couple years ago. Not having one on the roadmap, a safe, conservative, far out, non-corporate takeover hardfork, is contributing to this conflict. Right now, not having a plan committed to on the roadmap, means it couldn't go LIVE for at least 24 months from now. That might be ok from a demand perspective, if all the current development work pays off. But it's also arguably unneccessarily conservative from the perspective of what the network can handle while maintaining decentralization.

I think he’s just saying he objects to incentivizing the segwit tx format with a data “discount” that lets tx pay fees as though they were smaller than they really are if in segwit form.
He’s not wrong about that being by design, it’s just that in our community that’s seen as ok because of segwit’s (almost strictly better) benefits over normal tx that there was technical concensus over.
It’s not that cheap is bad, its that it picks segwit as a “winner”. Dumb complaint, but not as dumb as some people have misinterpretted it as.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:40:34

@_date: 2017-10-03 22:33:26
I still haven't seen any justification for assuming bad faith, the argument that they've honestly thought they had consensus and that the capacity increase would be beneficial to the ecosystem, user growth, price, etc. Why would the businesses (and miners) who are signers be incentivized to cause disruption in what would otherwise be a thriving ecosystem if they didn't honestly think they were helping? I just think they were wrong about how much support there was/would be, not that there was malice in the agreement.
@_date: 2019-09-29 12:54:45
Lower inflation of the currency supply just means interest rates to borrow need to be higher, in order to account for the expected increase in purchasing power over the duration of the loan. It means less ‘easy money’ and malinvestment of capital as people play hot potato to lend out their capital. It could be a great thing.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:20:55
To my point, those are all good reasons we *should* support scaling efforts before another blocksize increase, and why it’s risky/unwise not to do so, but those are judgement calls, not reasons we MUST, or that bitcoin couldnt survive and thrive with it.


There’s a circular logic to this; the desire to increase the blocksize is not a political move to control bitcoin in and of itself; only pushing to do so against concensus, with core team members explicity saying they would leave the project, makes it that. There are technical arguments and political arguments against this change, but they keep getting wrongly conflated in discussion.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:22:05
A factor in what? We don't need to trust anything about miners behavior, other than to assume that they'll act ruthlessly self-interested. Miner's that don't do so lose money to miners that do, until they either correct their strategy or get out-competed. Bitmain/Antpool mining empty blocks is perfectly within the bounds of acceptable behavior, not shady at all, just foolish/shortsighted of them, ha.

I like that logic, I buy that logic, but we've been discussing a possible upgrade path for literally years now. I think it was beneficial to test a fee market, I think Segwit was worth waiting for and it's capacity boost will allow the network to grow smoothly in the coming months, but I REALLY think we need to see commitment to an upgrade path NOW, even if it's conservative, even if it's 12+ months out to provide a safe amount of runway.
From my read of the general sentiment of people in opposition to Core's development path, there is still a lot of uncertainty around when (or even IF) BTC intends to allow network capacity to grow through block size increases. Is waiting to commit to a path after all the discussion, study, and simulation making the perfect the enemy of the good here? Committing to a future hard fork now before November would go a very long way to giving reasonable people who made the mistake of pushing for NYA a clean, clear way out that I'm not sure they have at the moment.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:45:57
By hardliner, do you mean they're just going to keep supporting the surviving chain because of course they will? They're a member of the community, and they supported a capacity increase because it would benefit them, but will follow the community and aren't forcing anyone to run anything.

Threats of lawsuits as a means of protection really ring hollow to my ears. If BTC can't fend off attacks without needing legal protections at this stage, what are we to do when the next "attack" comes from a jurisdiction outside of the US? If BTC can't survive without legal endorsement/protections, (which I think it can) better to fail now than much later.

I don't see shady gangsters at the *heart* of the support of bigger blocks, I just see people disappointed that the economics of bitcoin are changing as the system moves closer towards facing real resource constraints. Our argument is that it's better to face them now and find real, lasting scaling solutions even at the expense of growth now. Theirs is that growth is fragile and not guaranteed if we put it off, that we have more technological room to throw resources at the problem now, and that bigger blocks wouldn't hurt decentralization in a meaningful way.
These are all understandable, valid positions to hold/disagree with, because neither exactly what bitcoin is *supposed* to be nor what it actually *can* be is well defined. We, the community have to sort that out for ourselves, and unfortunately complex issues pertaining to peoples passions and economic well beings absolutely are prone to tribalism as a crutch for complex views.

I really want you to be right! While I've got a lot of faith in L2 technologies, I also think that the right approach to base layer scaling shouldn't be "as little as we can possibly manage" but rather "as much as we safely can". I have a hard time believing that in ~5-10 years the network wouldn't greatly benefit from (if not outright need) a larger blocksize without having to sacrifice any properties that anyone can reasonably point to.
We'd have to compare the numbers to know for sure, and unfortunately that's risky to assume not since so many of those newer technologies are still being developed/researched.

The system is designed such that individual miners have the right (and duty) to choose what to include or not. This would only become a problem of centralization if some (a majority) of miners start orphaning blocks that include transactions they don't agree with, which we are not seeing.

Also [1Hash]( same story (but ~2% instead of ~7% share). Not worth the effort to reconfigure mining software, even months after Segwit active with fees in the mempool? Concern over bloating the network? Effort to "cause congestion" in the runup to November?

Just to clarify your position then, if you had to pick a date right now (one as conservative as you’re comfortable with), when do you think is the latest a hark fork capacity upgrade would be warranted? 
My concern is that while a statement of intention is on the map, not having even a suggested, estimated time for such growth leads to an unbearable amount of uncertainty for the people working to create the businesses and applications that will be essential for it’s success, but also dependent on it’s scaling.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:06:28


People are concerned with transaction capacity, and have been using block size as a proxy for this. Segwit is not a 1--&gt;4x capacity increase, it's a 1--&gt; 1.8-2x capacity increase; the only way to reach 4 MB blocks would be with specially crafted all-witness data transactions which don't currently have a practical use case.
4MB blocks (or 8MB with S2x) would require an attacker, willing to buy out every block for (much) more than the average fees per block, every block, for a sustained period of time. This is also possible today with 1 MB block size / 4 MB block weight, at an even lower cost, and yet isn't something we've seen. Under normal use we cap out at ~2MB of data now, or ~4MB if we did 2X. This is indeed on the upper end of safety, and I agree S2X isn't warranted at this time, but it's [in line with what research has suggested could be handled by the network]( as of research from last year.


The OP isn't arguing for an imminent capacity increase, but rather for an increase at whatever the earliest point in the foreseeable future could be communicated and committed to now. Assuming spam stopped and what we have today is all organic transaction growth, maybe other efficiency boosts like Segwit adoption, LN, and Schnorr can absorb all tx growth in the next 12-24 months, but maybe not.


LN seems fantastic, but let's *please* not overestimate it's usefulness. People still need onchain tx to open/close channels, which is still a serious gate on the number of users. Assuming 100% lightning adoption and that it works flawlessly for every application, one open/close transaction on LN every month per user with no other transactions, and ~5 transaction/sec network capacity with what we have now in Segwit, that still only translates to ~6.5M users of bitcoin globally, the population of one sizable city. Even LN needs larger blocks for bitcoin to be globally relevant.

It can’t be the latter, there are non-trivial fee paying segwit tx before and after each of those recent blocks, and in blocks &gt;1MB with a non-empty mempool.

The all caps here is inane. The majority of BCH holders (or actual prospective buyers) don't refer to it as bcash, not that you cited evidence for your claim either. And lastly, pushing for some kind of name change this far after the fact, from a group of us who are largely antagonistic to it, is silly.
Just ignore it. It's really not hurting us. Something *needed* to come along and prove the right of the development choices and philosophy of BTC, it was never going to be untested. Might as well be BCH doing it.
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:25:58
If it were possible to know that, then that would mean this is as low as the price would go before going back up, which would mean it would be assured that if you buy now you could sell later for a higher price without any risk of it going down instead, and tons of people would just rush in to buy a ton... but it isn’t possible to know that. 
There is as there always has been tons that *could* still lead to BTC performing poorly in the future. That being said, i know i’m hodling.

I think his point is that while that's a perfectly valid opinion to have, not sharing that opinion does not make you an "enemy of bitcoin". Blocks are still full (all blocks in the last few hours at the limit). While that may not qualify as "congested", given the fee levels being paid, if there were more capacity turned on tomorrow, we would also have more (fee paying) tx. 
I'm against 2X now as well, but I can understand how someone could be in favor of trying to convince everyone else it's a good idea without being a bitcoin villain.

Newsflash: Coinbase doesn’t want to fire core either. They just want to ensure the best chance of future success for their company, and it looked like a capacity increase and activating segwit provided that. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:12:27
Merged it *when* though? If they merged it tomorrow, before the fork, I would agree with your point, or at least agree that they really dis agree with the somewhat silly philosophy that miners dictate the protocol. 
But i’ve been talking about it getting merged after the fork. After the economic majority, which really decide where value lies among the different protocols, gets to weigh in, and in what now looks like a very longshot, puts more support into the 2x fork leading to a price/difficulty death spiral on the other one. 
In that case, that’s the community at large coming to concensus around a single chain. They’d be free to leave if they want or keep working on a dead chain or HF its difficulty, but staying on wouldn’t be caving to the miners or to business, it would be the the community as a whole. 
The s2x chain needs everybody to work. It can’t deploy without development, activate without miners, be valuable without users willing to hold it. Seems unlikely it’s going to go 3/3.

“Against the hark fork now” makes sense to me. But not having a plan, with a target date, in the works means they’re also against a fork 12, 18, or even 24+ months down the road given how long these things take to plan and test. That position seems less defensible to me, and its the uncertainty of when (or some who believe “if”) a hard fork capacity upgrade will arrive.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:25:37
Very possibly, sure. But that’s looking like an awfully risky play at the moment. And i predict that the kind of fervent supporters of 1x are more heavily early adopter types with large stashes of BTC to make bets like this. I think there are 2x supporters but for most of them it’s more of a loosely held preference than a to the bone conviction. The only die hard 2x people i’ve seen are the kinda of people who have already cashed out of BTC into alts/BCH.
I have no evidence for any of the above, but thats my strong anecdotal hunch. I’d put my own wagers in against s2x but at this point 3:1 against seem like about the right odds to me.

Scam requires malicious intent, and i really don’t think the signers of the NYA, especially companies dependent on bitcoins success, had that in mind.

I think the above is an exaggeration, but i recognize that a lot of people don’t see it that way.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:44:31
Holy cow, you couldn’t have captured my views better. Any time commitment at all is better than the uncertainty and lack of a path we have now. Maybe go to 2MB, maybe just start with reasonable exponential increases. Is Core not sure what the right amount is? Go conservative! Is 12 months still a little risky for some reason? Go with 15 months! Any committed plan, with a set date and code in the works, would do wonders to easing tension with the more reasonable members pushing for sticking with the 2x agreement.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:54:57
It's a contrast to suggest equality in technical implementation, which there roughly is, because btc1 is a 1 issue repo which is 99+% identical to the core repo.
The thing that makes bitcoin Bitcoin is user support; if 2x had widespread user support (seems clear it doesn't) it could have become bitcoin too.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:03:35
Seems a little over the top, no? Surely you’ve come to terms with the fact in a permissionless, uncensorable system, some people will always find uses for it you don’t personally see as valuable?
I’d even agree that veriblock’s usage is inefficient and even annoying, but the distinction between its tx and ‘normal’ fee paying tx is (and should continue to be) 0 from the system’s perspective.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:32:28
Is there anything meaningful to be drawn about the reap capacity increase coming out of Segwit from this block as an example? With 75% of tx in segwit format, and a 1.34MB block, does that suggest that 100% adoption is a ~50% increase? That seems a little lower than previous projections, but I'm guessing a single block example isn't enough to draw that conclusion from.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:03:31
One interesting thing that has surprised me is how slowly mobile wallets have uptaken segwit. Trezor adopted the format within 2 weeks of activation; where you at Breadwallet? Copay? Mycellium? I’ve been told they’re working on it, but still no ETA.
@_date: 2015-09-29 18:03:51
Reputation systems provide the incentive. Only buyers that have it established can charge a price premium people will pay, which is valuable; not sending goods promised would (in theory) destroy more value than hanging on to the inventory saves.
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:21:02
Ehh, kind of? Those definitions ignore the revamped "block weight" that segwit uses to calculate how many tx can be included in a valid block, but using only standard transaction format and what has been the understanding of transaction capacity prior to segwit's activation a few weeks back, yes.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:13:07
I’m with you on the first two points, but there is no MUST in developing further scaling improvements before a capacity change. S2x may not be *wise* at this time, but if the whole community supported it, it could very much be implemented and run successfully without destroying bitcoin, while further scaling improvements are made.

@_date: 2017-07-16 23:30:55
Fully incorrect? I think we're only getting hung up on the meaning of the word "effectively" and otherwise are saying the same thing, right? Segwit the proposal, including a move to block weight instead of simply block size, is not a scaling solution in itself. It's an increase in the sense that after activation, approximately twice as many of today's normal transactions can fit in every block, which will contain approximately twice as much data (~2MB instead of 1). A block size hardfork increase would do the same thing, right? It's just that segwit accomplishes it through a less disruptive soft fork, and fixes malleability at the same time.

I see how LN charging a variable fee is akin to a toll road, but so is the main blockchain, right? That's exactly what network fees are to send regular transactions, "flexibly priced based on congestion." And the reason those work to alleviate congestion is because they disincentivize use, by pushing drivers with the least marginal utility from being on the road to leave it, and from transaction use cases with the least marginal utility to not send transactions.
OPs argument was that increasing the block size falls prey to the induced demand problem while Segwit/LN don't, but it seems to me this flexible priced congestion reducing mechanism shown as the solution is already built into the base layer, so it either works for both, or it doesn't, right?
There are good reasons not to increase block size overmuch in favor of 2L or off chain scaling solutions, but this metaphor doesn't seem to apply as I'm hearing you and OP suggesting.

No Problem, I think I'm reasonably well versed on this, and can offer a decent link for a basic explanation of [Segwit functioning.](
There are no improvements to the actual block data needed for a transaction with Segwit, meaning the suggestion that 8MB of transactions can fit into a 4MB block weight with Segwit is mistaken. (Correct me here if I'm wrong, because I would love to be)
I believe the improvement allowing a tx with many inputs to take up less space is an improvement with adoption of Schnorr Signatures, also on the timeline.
Segwit proposal is a capacity increase that also enables scaling improvements, but is not a scaling improvement in itself.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:56:37

The basis of the NYA was to aim to be a "compromise", and notwithstanding all the arguments that horse trading style compromises have no place in technical development, that's what it it is. If Segwit wasn't something miners could agree was acceptable, they wouldn't have agreed to it. I see the argument that BIP 148  accelerated their timetable some to avoid the disruption of a temporary split/market confusion of 2 chains, even if it settled quickly, but I don't think UASF pushed them to adopt Segwit which they otherwise wouldn't have.

When you say can't run off and never be found, are you saying that's the barrier?

For practical ownership, I totally get it; if you can't control the movement of your stuff, and someone else can, they practically own it.

How do larger blocks results in higher fees compared to smaller blocks? That doesn't seem to follow, unless it's spurring adoption so substantially that it creates more demand than the increase created in space, but I assume you don't mean that.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:13:06
It's saying very explicitly that "new style structure" blocks can hold more data. More data, for more transactions. This means a transaction on segwit is expected to take up the same amount of data (and the same amount of space in the "new block structure" as before segwit. It's just not counted against the "block size limit". Not a joke. 
Capacity increase yes, scaling increase enabled for the future, but not directly included in the Segwit proposal.
@_date: 2017-07-10 06:13:25
Are you forgetting the part where the price falls when the capacity increase first arrives? Why do you assume fees would need to be sticky, other than through lackluster fee calculators? 
If these additional people are adopting bitcoin, how could fees be higher with larger blocks than if the size wasnt raised?
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:26:32
Transaction fees are not determined by the software, only supply of space is; fees are the result of market forces. If segwit creates more blockspace supply for transaction data, which we can all agree it does, then the expected result is absolutely a drop in fees until more transactions per block start happening to fill up available space.
Whether the space discount of 75% for witness data is the RIGHT discount is a different debate entirely. If you're arguing segwit would be more fair with a 0% witness discount for weight, then why?
Here's an argument for a discount in the first place: 
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:40:13
This should be remembered more often. I think there's something in human nature to want to believe in "higher powers", even in realms like cryptography and economics.
The best critique I've heard of this argument is that people got into bitcoin because of the vision satoshi first described, and it became THEIR vision for bitcoin too. When actions (or inactions) are taken that move the development trajectory away from that first described picture, "this isn't satoshi's vision" is just a shorthand for "hey, I thought we had all agreed long ago exactly what the end priorities here are."
I disagree with the above, but I can at least empathize with people who hold that view, even perhaps in the face of new data, research, thought experiments that suggest different paths.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:48:02
After a block size increase (say ~100% more space for normal transactions with either segwit or a straight block size increase), immediately it should be easy to drop fees to well below current levels and still expect confirmation, right? Maybe later, after more time, adoption, users come, and blocks fill up again and competition resumes, we find we get back to a similar fee level from before the increase, can we agree that the immediate effect of a block size increase would lower network fees?
I see the argument that this isn't a scaling solution, it just kicks the can, and creates a slippery slope to just keep raising the block size to fix capacity problems is dangerous, also agreed.
I used the term "sticky" to refer to the concept that right after a capacity increase, people may be used to paying higher fees and many are likely to continue to do so even though they're no longer needed with extra space out of habit/ignorance/inertia, or from bad fee calculators. I meant it in the same way it's sometimes referred to wages:
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:31:06
I'm starting to see a lot more Trumpy, propoganda meme naming of things like "Shitmain" here, almost always coming from new accounts. Cut that crap out. It doesn't come off as clever, it comes off as immature and toxic and it makes all of us look bad. 
They're called Bitmain. Disagree with them or what they do/say/stand for all you want, but don't reduce the argument to memey name calling.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:23:28
I don't think I'm being "dishonest" to point out that correlation =/= causation. Both efforts by users and efforts by miners to activate a new feature like segwit are also correlated with a widening acceptance in the community of the value of that feature (from both miners and users) is one alternative explanation. Another is that when users start to rally around a new feature like Segwit that the market appears to approve of the price rises, causing miners to accept changes as a way to chase that price rise, rather than necessarily out of fear that a UASF would orphan them out.
None of the above are proof that you're not totally correct, however. My point is just that me threatening to shoot someone if they don't back down and having them run away is *not* proof that my gun can actually shoot.
I would be very interested (but not exactly eager) to see an actual showdown where a UASF that miners and users disagreed on more vehemently triggers, complete with exchange support for the resulting forks, as a real test of the market's power to decide the future of a protocol.
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:51:45
A stand we need to take for the time being, or forever? Are you saying you cant imagine a future where technology will allow nodes to trivially handle a larger block size such that a hard fork could be planned well in advance in order to gain actual concensus to make such a change?
If you want to stick with 1 MB forever, do you not expect bitcoin itself to fade out as a competitor able to replicate its best properties while attracting more users comes into play? Genuinely would like to understand the hard line viewpoint.
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:27:10
Thanks for this detailed review of arguments! The only question I have as a followup to these that I \*haven't\* seen a specific answer to yet, is if you don't think it makes sense to be making concrete plans for a capacity increase in the base layer today, under what conditions would your opinion change? What variables do you see as being relevant to the need for such? It seems to be that being on a different page about the answer to that is what really ends up dividing otherwise sensible people.

@_date: 2017-07-16 19:22:32
Hold on a second, though. Segwit the protocol change isn't a bus in this analogy. Segwit itself isn't an efficiency improvement; transactions are not expected to take up fewer bytes just by making use of Segwit. 
Segwit the *proposal* IS a capacity increase, but only because it allows for Witness data to not be counted against block size, effectively allowing for more space to be used for transactions every block. This is directly like adding more lanes to a road in the original analogy, right?
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:03:21
Transaction fees are an important part of the block reward longterm, and I agree we shouldn’t be expecting tx to be free.  That said, wouldn’t you agree that if blocksize increased slowly, at less than (what I think we both would predict is likely to be substantial) growth in demand for BTC, we could increase capacity while retaining fee pressure?
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:03:19
Wow, we're throwing a lot of bolded words around without making a direct argument, but seeming to imply lots of things.
No one is forcing anyone to take a bus, are they? Everyone will have access to the public roads of the main blockchain, the concern is only "are we building the right amount of roads?" and "what are the opportunity costs of building those roads". I'm not seeing any communism vs. capitalism existential struggle here.

They left, or perhaps continue to hodl but abandoned the use case of small transactions.

It depends on exchange support, and the resulting market for coins. If exchanges dont support trading for both chains in the event of an initial fork, i doubt even 10% of miners would switch to a chain they cant readily sell coins on for very long.
Assuming there is exchange support, it will also depend on the results of offering both coins to the market. If the uasf side doesnt show a positive market value relative to the status quo coin, its also unlikely to get miner support (and subsequently likely to drop quickly in value). 
Some argue that this value shift will collapse quickly into one coin or the other and that hash rate will follow if all actors are rational, but i am concerned this is a bad assumption, and that players on all sides will be willing to act at a loss to push towards their preferred outcome.
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:20:17
At All? Im not sure about you, but its at least mostly about enacting segwit for me. This isn't some battle miners lose permanently, this is just an example of forcing the issue. We can still be in this situation again even if this BIP succeeds, and we can still use it again if its ever needed in the future with this or something else if it fails.

He doesnt want SegWit for making transactions cheaper, but he *does* want a HF to larger blocksize to make transactions cheaper? That doesnt really follow. Are you arguing segwit makes transactions cheaper outside of a total space increase somehow?

I’m fine with any payment processor helping to push for BTC adoption over more traditional payment methods, as Bitpay undoubtedly has. They may not be perfect, or supportive of a maximalist viewpoint, but we should be focusing energies on pushing to get more users of bitcoin payment processors, not pushing the (small percent) of merchants already working with one to switch to a marginally better one, right?
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:53:47
Thank you for the specificity of this response, I’ve had a very hard time getting that level of hypothetical detail. My biggest concern has been that some people supporting limited blocks haven’t (or refuse to) consider their own answer to this question, and I have a hard time wrapping my head around the future of a Bitcoin that never for any reason allows for additional capacity.
I hope to keep pushing to shift the question from “why can’t we raise the limit right now?” every other week to “under what conditions could we all agree are sensible to do an increase in the future.”
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:10:22
Is that a vote for "Never raised the block size limit beyond 1MB through a HF"? Seems unnecessarily conservative to me.

I would fully, genuinely love to be convinced of this, if you could elaborate. Do you see BTC becoming a world currency, used by &gt; 1 billion people? If so, with that many 'users', how do you forsee people interacting with the blockchain? I struggle to understand how even with LN becoming wildly successful that a base layer that never increases raw data capacity could allow for so many people, let alone why improvements in technology would prohibit growth in the coming decade(s).
As an example, if segwit adoption continues, schnorr and other (10-40%) scaling improvements are implemented, functionally we still end up with ~5k tx/block, yes? That's about 21B tx over 80 years, is that enough to support enough of the world to make BTC interesting to you?
Not trolling, genuinely want to understand your point of view on this, as you don't seem to be alone.
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:43:38
Would you predict interest in the potential of crypto fading fully down to 0 from here? What do you think the chances of growth and development of the infrastructure just completely ceases on it’s own?
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:35:58
I assume you mean most people, yes, if not everyone? If we end up with a billion users, there will only be blockweight for a few dozen onchain tx for each of them in their whole lifetimes if we never raise the limit further. If you were just learning about bitcoin for the first time in the future, would you be interested in using BTC and running a full node if your interaction with the blockchain were to be that limited?
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:35:49
Did it get that way without centralized 3rd parties who found a niche in the market to work hard at eliminating pain points and making the technology more accessible? I don’t think so. 
Furthermore “using” the internet today as we understand it for most people is specifically connecting with such services, like facebook, youtube, etc. The more technically minded early on may have been able to set up their own webpages/email servers, troubleshoot hosting issues all without that kind of help, but those people, like those today capable of configuring good open source alternatives like BTCpay servers, are in the minority. “The goal” of bitcoin won’t be reached with just them, and entities like Bitpay should be seen as necessary stepping stones.

@_date: 2017-06-27 16:14:46
The author seems to be assuming that a decentralized network with hubs would be of no value, and all his examples are built around a fully distributed network with no hubs. Thats why he's assuming to be able to flexibly connect to anyone on the network without hubs, available fund would need to be divided evenly among all possible independent routes. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:23:23
You seem to have ignored the bulk of my post; I just offered an example of how raising the blocksize could *increase* node count through an increase in total users.
You mentioned LN withdrawls, but that of course still requires users to onboard with onchain tx. A forever limited blockweight, even with all the optimizations projected, still leaves a maximum user count in the millions, not the billions. 
How fast was that 10 Mbps connection 10 years ago, and how fast do you anticipate it being in 10 years for the same cost? 
If BTC stops growing well before satisfying the demand for cryptocurrencies, poised to be massive and global, you had best be able to see that it will quickly start *shrinking* in the face of one of those alts that strikes a better balance between capacity and decentralization than “lets never upgrade the network.”
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:13:14
I’d agree Bitpay’s focus hasn’t been ideal, but “The enemy of bitcoin” is a huge overstatement. With S2x they (along with lots of others) tried to achieve concensus for an idea they supported, and backed off that support once it became clear that concensus wasn’t going to materialize. That’s how the system is supposed to work, and frankly, it’s likely to happen again in disputes between members of this community who seem to be in tight agreement today.
Bigger picture is important here. The label of “enemy” should be reserved for those who want to see the whole system fail and disappear, not those who want to see it grow and prosper in a different way than we do.

@_date: 2017-07-09 20:07:29
I THINK from that confusing, incomplete sentence of a tweet, that's a comment about the witness discount. This isn't a concern that increasing capacity will make transaction fees lower; lowering transaction fees by increasing block capacity is the whole thing the big block camp wants. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:25:49


I want to offer this plausible hypothetical scenario: BTC starts increasing blockweight by some modest rate with respect to technological improvement, like ~17%/year once proposed to align with bandwidth improvement, starting next year. In 4-5 years, we’ve doubled the current blockweight. At the same time, user growth continues to outstrip capacity growth, causing fees to continue rising, but only ~60% as high as they would have been with no increase, but with twice as many users. Nodes are a little more expensive to run, run rate drops to ~80% of the rate it would have been with a static blockweight.
In the above scenario, in 5 years time we’d have blocks twice as big allowing for ~2x the use/users, paying 120% of the total fees with 160% of the node count compared to a more limited userbase in a scenario that doesn’t expand capacity. Would that not be strictly more secure? Are any of those assumptions nonsensical?
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:59:54
Very true. Also, LOTS of people can predict the alt coin surge. Lots of people can predict lots of things. It's the being right that's hard, and differentiating being right because you were smart and accurately understood something about the fundamentals that wasn't obvious to everyone else, vs. being lucky. Too easy to confuse the latter for the former.
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:42:36
I think the question is if the logic is we need to design a system with cost of bandwidth in mind, does it make sense to not also be factoring in tx fee cost? If you think it's irrelevant, I'd like to understand why.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:05:48
Do you expect bitcoin acceptance to go from the state it’s in now, in terms of trust, familiarity, usability, all the way to fully replacing fiat for savings, commerce, without transitional steps? 
If not a payment processor that aids a non-developer audience and helps make it easy to confidently accept and track an unfamiliar currency like BTC, then what do you imagine the path to mass adoption to be?
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:11:24
I see you disagreeing with me, but that’s a huge accusation with no evidence I’m aware of. Literally the only code change that was proposed in the actually released S2x code increased the block size (with some bugs that caused it to crash, since it wasn’t tested as well as it needed to be). I don’t think there’s anything real to support what you’re accusing them of, but I’d be very interested to see what you’re referring to if I’m missing something. Links?
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:31:53
Do you not have an answer to either question? Code is great, but it doesn’t lead to use and adoption by itself.

Sure, if he wants to leave that money on the table he's welcome to do so. He'd have to reject blocks that contain those transactions to have an impact on usabilty though, and then we're just in fork territory.
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:46:25
And Bitcoin *does* allow that. But it also allows you to use an intermediary if you so choose, and intermediaries like Bitpay should be welcome to prove their services offer value worth the risk required in trusting them, and that they’re worth that trust. 
I would argue the beauty of the invention isn’t that all 3rd parties that require some trust to use are destroyed, it’s that the ones that exist *are forced to become more deserving of that trust* because they’re no longer mandatory.
We should be educating people about the pitfalls of such services when we find them, and pushing entities like Bitpay to be better (agree that BIP70 is a little shady), but their existence in and of itself is not a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:10:01
Because it’s aiming for unbounded increases, which I think we both know no one here is arguing for.
I’d rather consider possible ways the more conservative, decentralization minded BTC might retain its most interesting properties while also allowing for more total users in the medium term. 
Do you think capacity constraints won’t lead some significant number of people away from BTC in the next few years, affecting it’s value and therefore also that security?
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:16:25
This isn’t a reason not to increase the blocksize, unless you’re arguing it will always be the case that an increase is unacceptable for slippery slope reasons. Do you expect BTC to reach it’s full potential without ever expanding capacity?
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:22:45
The functional limit with blocks full of real, typical tx is closer to 2MB. Higher than that won’t get hit without creating tx specifically aimmed at doing nothing useful but making large blocks.

I suppose we'll see. It seems to me that while adversarial hypotheticals can be shown that demonstrate LN's potential weaknesses, the practical reality will be much different because of reputation effects, and because there is always the secure, decentralized BTC network to fall back onto.
Day 1, some supposed working, functional release of LN is put out there. Place like Coinbase, Bitpay, Paxful, LBC, Gemini set themselves up as liquid, highly capitalized LN nodes (hubs) and begin offering channel services to anyone (and to each other) at competitive rates. These are the places that will be most driven to be broad working nodes and at low rates, because LN offers a great opportunity to actually scale their business. Coinbase isn't going to "attack" me in any of the ways described; even if they somehow pull it off and get to eat my $150 worth of BTC as I'm doing some black friday shopping, their reputation suffers far, far more than that was worth.
The vast majority of my BTC transactions are between my own wallets and services like the above. Even if only those businesses (and a few others like gambling sites, for example) made use of LN, that would immediately be a useable scaling solution for me, and likely for many others.

I understand how forks and consensus work, what I’d like to understand better is why you think no hard fork capacity increases are (ever?) Part of an ideal path. If its not black and white, paint me your grey, but lets not hand-wave it away.
What kind of impact do you see on network growth without any further capacity increases in, say, the next few years? Can we onboard 10x the current userbase? I’d think that should be a good goal, based on growth so far, no?
