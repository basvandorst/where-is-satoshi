Life is always about risk and reward. I didn't get to where I am right now by always being conservative and following the general acceptance of others. 
In one year I will know whether or not it was a good or bad investment. The world won't end for me if it turns out to be a poor investment, I will just file it under a capital loss when I file taxes.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:51:48
Coinbase was the only US based exchange I noticed. They were also being covered by the media, so I felt the safest processing larger transactions with them.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:04:41
Thanks for your comment! When I first read your username before I read your post, I was sure that it was someone who just created an alt account to flame me - I was gladly surprised. :)
Yes, it does seem so, but I can't even put the blame specific to Reddit since I see this all the time. All around the web, in different forums or communities, there is a constant hate towards the wealthy, and even worse if you are young. I am actually very surprised I didn't hear more of the "daddy's money" bullshit in this thread. That usually comes up a lot. The interesting thing is I had the same exact thread on HackerNetwork, and its currently at 500+ posts and there was basically no one there complaining about how I handled myself or that I am acting entitled. Just two folks posted my instagram account, had a few laughs and is it, never went past 2 comments. It is almost as though that community there is much more mature.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:42:02
I understand. Your experience is different though because when I clicked the buy button, they did not say that. What it did say is that the price I will receive is the price that coins will be at on the day I was supposed to receive it. They never gave me the coins on the day I was supposed to receive them.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:56:56
Gold for you. Enjoy.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:52:36
No, they just put me in the same exact situation as I would have been had they credited me the very second they locked in a price for me last Friday.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:03:19
I am flattered that you continue to write so much about my character. You didn't hit anything directly in the head, because you are straight up delusional. I never asked for special treatment just because I have money, you can read this thread up and down and you will never see a single time when I said I deserve better treatment since I am wealthy. The only thing I was asking for is treatment, that is all. 
Once again, if you look at the history page you would see I had done several transactions with them already. I already had a history with this company and did not have any problems. But then all of a sudden this transaction became a problem and I felt that all my support emails were being pushed off to the side. CoinBase might have complaints here and there, but guess what, practically all the other exchange sites have even worse complaint/praise ratio.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:32:46
They fixed the issue. Everything is now resolved.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:40:40
Bank of America
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:51:03
They should have done this because they were supposed to lock in the price last Friday and also deliver that same Friday. Instead all they did was lock in the price but failed to deliver.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:12:39
It is unfortunate, but I am not going to attempt to sway the masses here. I came here with an open mind about the community, I answered the first few questions here calmly and then out of nowhere I begin to be flamed.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:05:58
Brian from CoinBase has responded to me on ycombinator:
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:31:50
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:59:54
I am not sure if it is based on volume or simply market volatility. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:15:58
Sorry to hear that. You might need to make your voice heard loud enough to have the issue resolved in your favor. Make sure you document everything.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:56:36
Yes, they do that sometimes and other times they show a different message.
Even if you compare that to my situation, they did not lock in a market price for me on the 8th when I placed my order, they did it on the 13th, the day I was supposed to receive my order. See the difference?
This is now eight business days since the payment has been sent out. Far beyond any expected delivery range they have provided.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:42:15
It looks like my complaint has actually circulated the interwebs to a good extent. Jason on twitter even twitted my scenario:
I guess his 180k twitter fans will now be aware of the issue as well. Too bad CoinBase didn't fix this issue privately with me sooner.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:45:01
Yes they are, and they continue to exhibit such behavior.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:03:02
The front page of what?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:57:44
Hah, well I believe I finally got to answering you. This was my first time posting a topic on reddit that actually drew comments. I wasn't completely sure on how to see all the new comments until just now.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:46:41
I am sorry that you were treated differently. It is pretty crazy that even with a post here, and a much popular post on ycombinator they initially only credited the bitcoins at the outdated price. I had to complain some more and other users on ycom joined in as well, forcing enough pressure to have them credit the BTC at a fair rate.
Don't take the loss they have given you, press on them. Use my case as a precedent. It is quite clear that they need a more efficient system before taking on any more orders.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:14:12
Fair enough. I've been called worse.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:12:45
The thing, if they actually get retrieved coins for me on Friday, I would have received them by now. 
If they delivered the coins on the day they said they would, I could have sold at a 5 or 10% loss.
This can go all the way down to 90% and I can't do a single thing simply because they don't have coins to give me.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:42:46
I just opened my box of petty cash and decided to entertain myself. Don't worry yourself, this loss won't put a dent in my lifestyle.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:46:09
Just let me know when you grow enough balls to not make an alternate account to make a comment.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:08:53
I have had a few people privately ask me what my average cost is at the moment. Well since I take my BTC and exchange them into LTC, as of right now my average cost per LTC is around $17.50. As of this moment, I am up 4% on my "investment".
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:22:28
I appreciate the comment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:49:27
Let me clarify this again. While placing the transaction, they informed me that since the price of the coins is violate, they will deliver the coins to me at the market price that it is at that moment. They didn't say that they would be locking in a price for me the moment I hit "Buy". That also didn't happen.
What happened is on the day of delivery. The locked in the market price, and didn't deliver. If they locked in the market price and then delivered the coins the same day. We would not be having this discussion.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:55:10
I appreciate the suggestion. That will be my next course of action if public scrutiny does not do the trick first.
Gold for you, enjoy.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:53:17
Not sure, I guess since I was blurring out my email address, I decided I might as well do my last name in the same sweep.
Just that sometimes these screenshots can thrown around the web, so those viewers wouldn't know my username, and wouldn't be able to connect the dots.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:46:46
I just know that if this thread was about someones $250 going missing on CoinBase, then people would be much more sympathetic. But instead there is always this 1% vs 99% attitude. People believe that because I could afford to throw around money means I should be fucked over as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:05:56
Kyle, Bitcoins are not my only investment. What I do for a living is actually trade on the stock market. At the same time, I also have significant investments in index funds. My investment in Bitcoin was simply done out of trying to catch a bit of the action, and having something else to follow in addition. That is it, this is definitely not a serious investment, and I would never see it that way. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:04:41
Preciously so. There are too many people here that are too dense to actually understand what is happening. I have a friend that is in the same exact boat as me and also suffered a loss simply because they broke their own TOS.
Enjoy your gold.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:13:15
Oh trust me, when this case is finally put to rest, I will not holding the short end of the stick. They violated their own TOS and there will be repercussions for them. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:45:26
Why thank you, I appreciate the comment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:56:59
Thank you. I believe so as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:56:00
That actually sounds like a good idea. I can start a new topic, you guys can recommend a charity. Whatever charity mention gets the most upvotes after 48 hours would receive a donation equal to the value of 1 BTC at that time. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:47:56
Thank you, and no worries, no one here is getting to me. I have been facing this similar crowd of people for the past 3-4 years and at one point I realized that it is all noise. I am simply flattered that I anger them enough to lash out on me.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:43:06
Exactly so. Their mistake saved me $12k. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:21:01
How else do you think I acquired wealth? Scratching some lottery cards and hitting the jackpot? Squeezing my parents out of some money? Robbing a bank?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:27:51
I have seen that, which is why I first took the issue public here. I have also followed up with a post on ycombinator.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:01:28
You know what, I do believe that in your example the $1m customer should be treated with more promptness compared to the $1 customer because that larger customer can have a major affect on the company's bottom line. 
Also, the point of this thread was to capture as much attention as possible. I wanted this thread to be circulated all around the web. If this thread was complaining about $100 being lost in transaction, no one would bat an eyelash and this thread would have never left Reddit. Since $35k is seen as quite a bit of money by the general population, by throwing it in the title, I increased the chances of it being noticed.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:08:08
Just noticed that my article @ ycombinator is on the first page for the google search "CoinBase".
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:33:51
Hah yea, this thread has been quite the adventure and the hostility from both sides was great entertainment value. Now that the issue is completely resolved, and the comments are coming in slowly, I can take peace in the silence.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:36:46
That is correct. Many folks here are not understanding the situation.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:50:29
How can I update the title?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:13:56
I wouldn't do it any other way.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:50:06
I also had trust that CoinBase would come through, I was just becoming impatient at this point. What I hate most is the lack of response. If you looked at my history screenshot, you'll see that even while waiting for this $35k order to clear, I brought another 10k+ in coins using their instant delivery feature.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:06:16
I initially only had about $8k in coins when I placed the order for $35k. While I was waiting for the $35k order to clear, I cleared $10k more in orders first.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:56:53
They told me I would receive the coins on the 13th. No coins came on the 13th. That is all there is to know.
It has been eight business days, no coins.
There have been three unanswered emails. Oh yea, no coins.
My history page tells me my transaction was completed. But no coins.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:42:31
I feel that it would have been a great hassle having to meet up with many different people to fill such an order, not to mention the risk to my own personal safety.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:16:27
I deserve many things in life. Just that typically before I am bent over and fucked, I prefer that I am warned first and provided with lube.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:52:12
Exactly the issue. They put me in a situation were I cannot sell the coins at any price since I do not have the actual possession of the coins even though they said my coins are worth X value.
Their delay of delivery is hurting my investment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:00:17
A screenshot of the CoinBase account to further solidify that they did the right thing.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:22:08
Thanks Mike, but I am perfectly fine with taking the good with the bad. There are all sorts of people in the world, that is what keeps things interesting. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:53:02
Time to give gold to folks that actually listened to my story and didn't hold a bias against me because of my financial position.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:54:18
Very true, I can only imagine how many other buyers out there took the hit and were not loud enough to make their concerns heard.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:44:12
Well then, fuck you too. The only sum of money that I made a big deal of in this thread was the sum of money that I was owed. I simply took a screenshot of the sum at stake and the situation. It was relevant to the issue.
Carry on.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:47:22
Hah, well being 22...I have a long way to go before my kids even grasp the meaning.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:06:28
I am going to be holding for the months.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:51:17
This is a good ending. If the coin does return back to $800-$900, I will be sitting on a pretty decent gain.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:03:01
Hah. Just keep building and you'll get there soon enough.
My total investment in BTC right now sits at around $52k.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:52:47
I agree, thank you for the comment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:58:41
Exactly. The promised delivery on X date. Coins were never delivered on that date.
Enjoy the gold.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:25:59
Let me ask you something, have you looked around the CoinBase discussions for the past couple days? Haven't you seen at least a dozen other clients in the same exact situation as I were in a couple days ago? So far from what I can tell, their problem has still not been fixed. I acted in a specific way, and I got the result that I wanted. My attitude was just a means to an end. There is no reason for us to be sitting here criticizing how we act, or how we conduct business, we are two different human beings. What works for you, might not work for me, and vice versa. 
Living in NYC and being part of the financial industry, the way I acted is far from rude or demanding.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:47:36
When I placed the order, they informed me that I would receive the coins at the market price on the day they are crediting the coins. 
They did not do that. They placed a price on my coins later down the line, and failed to deliver the coins.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:08:25
There are literally so many other customers out there that are in the same exact shoes as I were. If you head over to ycombinator for my thread there, you will see plenty of people complaining about the same issue in my thread. My overzealous attitude in bringing this concern publicly not only has helped me, but it will likely set a precedent for other customers that have been wronged.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:53:17
Same to you buddy.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:06:34
Yes, because I cannot grab their attention any other way. They have no support phone line to begin with.
If they aren't answering my emails, what is my next course of action?
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:32:57
Considering I had about $18k in BTC from before, right now I am down about 15% overall from the original $53,278.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:56:54
I would like to say to the individual out there that is doing his very best to access my CoinBase account, good luck. I am fairly impressed that you were able to access my wireless provider and change my email address. Other than that, your attempts have been sloppy. Please also keep in mind that my coins are long gone from my CoinBase account and are sitting in a personal wallet in the darkest &amp; deepest place in the world.
I believe I would be right to believe that you are also the person that has been calling my cell phone from my own number? Why not talk to me when I pick up? :) I would be happy to speak with you. Utilizing a free online service to spoof your caller id isn't terrifying buddy.
edit: And once again you are accessing my CoinBase account and I am being notified about it. You aren't getting in. There is nothing there for you. Bank &amp; CC info have been removed. You will find $3 or so in BTC in here. Keep wasting your time.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:20:19
Take a look at my youtube channel. For over a year I have been 100% transparent with my trading, and helping others get started as well. I have never asked for a single dime from anyone and never sold any product.
I have over 5k minutes on my youtube that I have dedicated towards teaching others on the positions I take, why I take them, my expectations and so on. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:11:20
If they promised to credit you with the funds on X date but they did not, you definitely have to purse this matter.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:25:26
Ok, I just received the coins, and they ended up giving me the value they locked in on Friday.
Looks like my battle with them isn't coming to a close anytime soon. They should have delivered the coins on Friday like they said they would.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:43:07
What I am concerned about is the price that the bitcoins will be delivered to me at. If they deliver them at the market price that they coins are at the same instance they are crediting my account, I will have no issue with that.
If they have the audacity to price them at a market rate that is a week old, then all hell will break loose.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:02:26
Which video, the one with "Been HAD bitcoins"? I just made that video as a joke for the forum community that I am apart off. We tend to make "been had X" videos, and since I was posting an issue about bitcoins there, I decided to follow up with that video as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:54:19
I received the coins at today's market price + $50 in free coins. I came out ahead, thank you for your time borodino. Just remember, the next time I order a burger, make sure you don't include the pickles.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:02:42
Yes, you read me like an open book.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:02:00
Yes, I have been emailing them since Saturday. On Tuesday night I finally made the deadline. I do not see anything wrong with that.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:00:31
Thanks for the concern Mike, enjoy the gold.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:56:43
I wouldn't mind a couple extra hundred grand if things pick up. :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:44:32
My only intentions with BitCoins are for speculative purposes. A $35k ACH or wire transfer coming out of my bank account will not raise any eyebrows since I have larger transactions on a daily basis.
The funds cleared my bank last week, they are out of my account.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:46:36
MACD is a horrible indicator to daytrade with since it is a lagging indicator.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:08:32
It has proven to work before, and it shined through once again. :) 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:14:01
I am definitely happy with the resolution. I did end up securing the coins at a reasonable price and was also credited $50 for my troubles.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:00:19
Since when did I say I daytrade on CoinBase? Everytime I complete a purchase on CoinBase, I transfer the funds over to BTC-E.
If you look at the history screenshot, you will notice that I send the coins out right away.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:04:12
It is funny, and unless you are also in the trading space, you would lack the needed humor to find the inline joke. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:44:42
I am perfectly fine with that. I just want an even battlefield before facing any loses.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:04:15
I am being a dick, but sometimes that is the only way to have progress. Notice that after they first responded to me, I was courteous. Unfortunately for them, they went MIA on me from that point on. If they simply stayed in contact, then this drama could have been averted. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:38:09
How were you able to trade it up and down several times and only left with 3-4% of your initial principle?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:02:29
That is me. Excuse the shitty article though, that was a horrible editor. The college wanted for me to give a brief interview for their paper in hopes to motivate their incoming students as well their current students. The editor did a very poor job in covering the interview.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:52:05
Sorry to hear that. Make sure you keep bugging them on twitter.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:08:30
Did you not see the history screenshot were the moment I receive BTC from CoinBase I transfer them out immediately? I never used CoinBase as a medium to daytrade. CoinBase promised me X price on Y date. They gave me X price, but no delivery on Y date. Why is that so difficult to comprehend?
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:25:25
The $50 free credit they offered is a complete insult to injury. They managed to take $347 in fees from me, and completely failed to deliver on time, caused a loss of $12k and then refunded less than 20% of the fee they took from me?
Great business skills CoinBase.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:09:07
Sorry, I'm not following you on your comment. Can you please rephrase?
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:49:21
They did not store the price of BTC the day I clicked order. They informed me that they would lock in the price of the coin for me on the day they were expecting to make the delivery. They told me they would deliver on the 13th. On that day, they do lock in the price as they said they would, but they did not give me the coins.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:50:42
The issue should now come to a close. Brian from CoinBase just updated his post once again to let me know that they will honor today's price since it was their mistake.
I am happy to see things come to a close without having to get lawyers involved. It is unfortunate that this matter was taken public, but I simply was not receiving an answer via emails.
Lastly, I want to thank Reddit.com for being a fantastic outlet on bringing enough attention to issues that would typically be looked past if kept in private. I will continue handing out gold to fellow members below in support of the website.
If I offended anyone in specific here, I apologize. Mistakes such as this one happen on a frequent basis in business and at some point you lose your patience very quickly. Too much time is sometimes wasted on fixing problems that shouldn't have been there in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:40:53
Isn't instagram an outlet for just putting up stupid things and having fun? All my followers on instagram are friends from college. They enjoy it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:29:05
No, they credited me the coins at a price they came up with a week later, and then took another 5 days to finally give me the coins.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:26:17
Yes, it is quite clear now. As I said before, if this was another member complaining about their $250 going missing, the atmosphere in here would be completely different. Too many people here think I deserve my losses simply because of my financial situation. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:08:57
The world is an interesting place.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:39:56
I didn't proclaim that I was a professional in anything. What matters is that at the end of the day I got exactly what I was pushing for. My complaint on reddit is a far cry from "crying".
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:14:44
Honestly, I am done speaking to you. We are running in circles. I am not sure what you are trying to prove at this point, that I am a dick? Ok, maybe I am. It doesn't matter to me. When it comes to business, I sometimes have to act a specific way to get results. If you are too kind, too nice, you get taken advantage of.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:13:36
Bank of America treats me very well. I have no issues with them.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:22:43
Believe it or not, I work my ass off in my businesses to make the money I do. I never allow myself to be complacent on the loss of money when another company is at fault.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:31:34
I appreciate the compliments. It is all thanks to the hard work I put in in my early teenage years. I had my first interest in business at the age of 13 and worked my ass off everyday. 
Since I was a great tennis player, I began by giving sparring lessons. Making $20/hr. This gave me some capital. I then began to import phone accessories from China/HK and sell them in bulk to smaller stores in New York and online. I was 14 at this time. 
Right before turning 15, I looked into the advertising industry and placed all my effort there for the next 5 years - actually making a million dollars during my college years.
Right as I turned 20, I began to focus in the financial sector and was trading my own capital and have been doing that for the past 1.5 years. I turned 22 this past Sunday.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:58:25
It worked better than their support team email did.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:40:17
I absolutely love how every positive comment here towards me is downvoted while negative comments towards me are upvoted. It is quite clear that the sheeple mentality is strong here as well.
Don't quit your day jobs folks.

Their delay in delivery was actually a blessing for me. Had they delivered on time, and I decided to sit through the pain, I would be down quite a bit. Unfortunately for them, but fortunately for me, they didn't send me the coins then, but they did now at a much more attractive market price.

Had they even responded earlier this morning telling them that they are looking into my case and will respond in 24 hours I would have avoided posting this thread altogether. I waited four days since my initial two emails before I became irate.

I understand what you are saying, but you also have to keep in mind who holds more control in the situation. When you work at your job and are trying to lock in clients, your clients are in the position of control. They can turn down your offer and look elsewhere. You are seeking for their money. When I face the same situation which is trying to appease the other party for their business, I act as courteous as possible. Now, if the situation is switched, I will act as demandable as possible.

Does anyone know the quickest route towards handing out "gold"? Entering my CC information everytime I want to give some gold is a tedious task.

When I was first answering the questions posted on here, I was doing it without emotion or attitude. At one point, the comments started to become very hostile and it left a very sour taste in my mouth. I reacted to it unfortunately.

Thank you for the comment.

1% was the fee. Not 10%.

Let me tell you something bostonhotpocket. First of all, shut the fuck up. You did not know me, you never personally spoke with me, you do not know who I am as a person. Don't fucking sit here and tell me that I am a "rich, spoiled, entitled little man child" when you do not know what I have gone through to get where I am. 
I gave the "poor" customer service rep four days to respond to me before I gave an ultimatum. I was fair enough. I did not get to where I am because I am nice with people, or that I care about their feelings. It is a dog eat dog world out there.

Not really, they gave me coins at today's market value, so I have all my coins back.

The only time I ever mentioned the amount of money this transaction consisted off was my original post. I never repeated the money in any comments ever again. Stating the sum of money is relevant. The same way in a different thread someone said that CoinBase saved this one guy $400 by cancelling his order. Why is it that he could tell people how much money he saved, but when I tell people how much money I am out off, I get hell.
And yes, I do contacts with several publications. My best being Wallstreet Journal. 
The reason why I specifically asked for an eight hour reply is because I was ready to reverse my ACH later that day. My last email with the demand was sent at around 5 AM. I decided that I will head to sleep, if I do not get a reply by the time I wake up, then that is it, time to reverse. I didn't get a reply but I decided to give them one last time to make good on either Reddit or HackersNetwork since they are active on both sites. As much as such posts might hurt their reputation online, an individual initiating a reverse on an ACH will be hurting them on the banking side.

Thank you for your comment.

I took the issue serious and I decided to take this issue public. For a company that is in the process of acquiring venture capital, reputation is very important. I know they follow reddit and also hacker news. This was one of the effective ways of getting their attentions before I speak to my lawyer.
Regarding my age, I just turned 22 a couple days ago.

Yes it is, the only thing that was missing was promptness on their end. If they processed the transaction on Monday as they did just now, I would have had only glowing things to say about their company.
