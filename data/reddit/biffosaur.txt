Not everyone is a "small-time speculator" a lot of us are just early adopters who got a hold of some bitcoin before institutional investors. We may not have the volume they do, but they can't skim wealth off what I don't let leave my wallets ;)

Might be doable...lol 
Sell that shit and buy something with fans!

I couldn't read past the first paragraph on my phone and also can't seem to edit my other comment reply lol
  
That's pretty interesting research you did, I'm assuming that's in USD? Now what was the market cap at when you ran those numbers? I'm curious because as the market cap increases there will obviously be more and more accounts with over 100k USD, but I want to see how many millionaires bitcoin brings into the world!

So if I was the owner-operator of this...do I have to fill it up with bit coins at first? And people could sell bitcoins to the ATM as well, right? Do you get to set the fees associated? 
  
I think it'd be awesome to get one of these up on my schools campus

I was somewhat under the impression that because this open source design is really more of a vending machine that KYC shouldn't apply....I'll have to look more into it, thanks for replying!

Do it!!! Ek9's are sooooo amazing! I've been driving EK's since I got my license and would kill for a type-r! 
  
It might be a good idea to just pay for some in BTC if you could afford a small monthly loan payment. Give that a thought at least! 
  
Pics if you get it! Also, PLEASE get a cool bitcoin license plate!
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:56:50
This is AWESOME! Thanks for following up on this, I really appreciate being able to see these numbers!
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:04:45
Hey man, I mean I'll be honest I'm making like 10 bucks a day mining on one computer...it's not a ton but being a college student it's better than nothing and once you get it going you can let it run and just rake in the coins! Mining's pretty sweet!
  
Also I wasn't the one who disappointed you lol
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:46:55
Yeah, I've dealt with the whole chargeback issue before. What do you mean as far as the legality? 
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:03:27
If I get some, I promise to divide them up and give them to the groomsmen in my wedding, and hopefully they'll do something cool with them. If not, I still think this you're awesome.

I know at least ten people who would buy a few bucks, and I'm sure word of mouth would bring more people in. I've been trying to spread Bitcoin as well as I can through word of mouth for a couple years now. Its not like the transactions would be huge but I could totally see a business or engineering major who has a couple bucks in change grabbing some bitcoin for the sake of saying they have some! And hell, I think it'd just be cool to say our school has a bitcoin ATM! 
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:57:07
Awesome, thanks for replying! 
I'm gonna consider doing coins and see what the costs would be like. It would also be cool to be able to do credit cards maybe using something like square or another one of those mobile swiping attachments that you use on iOS and android. They're free depending on the company so its worth a shot in my book 
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:20:05
I didn't take any advice I just like numbers...lol 
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:57:40
What regulations are you talking about? I'm curious because I'm working on a similar project
@_date: 2014-01-06 06:53:49
It's almost like I can feel the disappointment through your text
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:36:09
I know in principle you're right, but I would gladly bet that if I leave ten percent of my bitcoins in a wallet and never trade those they will be worth more than zero in a years time. My point is not all bitcoins have to be in constant circulation to hold a value. I'm setting some aside for when I can use them to better my life.
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:41:20
What are you mining on? You could always mine primecoin, you don't even need a GPU for that (I'm using my laptop right now).
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:28:19
This news is so good, I wouldn't be surprised if we hit 400 by tomorrow!
@_date: 2014-01-08 04:32:45
I would rather get behind a company like Costco than probably any other major retailer...they're good people
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:44:52
I'm gonna hoard some and you can't stop me! Because...you know...freedom and stuff
@_date: 2014-01-06 19:20:24
Im excited to see where you project goes as I'm really interested in raspberry pi projects. If you don't mind me asking, what are you using for a bill reader? My biggest concern is counterfeit money
  
I also love the idea of being able to load up however much money you want and then hit the button. 
  
Any plans to take change as well? I feel like in Canada it would be almost necessary

IANAL= I am not a lawyer? Please say yes
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:22:36
my 280x do not get 800 khash, and this gpu will be worth MUCH more than 100 bucks in a year....my 7950's from last year are worth MORE than I bought them for now. 
  
Please do some more research
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:48:46
I figure well keep rising till between 1500-2000 within a month or so, next big dip will come from a psychological wall and greedy sell offs if anything. 
  
Hopefully more and more big businesses *cough cough, Netflix* will release public statements about plans to accept bitcoin and the next big drop won't be so drastic. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 00:35:36
I guess, but that extra 100 khashes adds up! lol 
  
GPU's are still cost-effective for almost any scrypt coin really, and I think they will be for a while longer. It's definitely a good investment. 
  
I'm not selling my GPU's for a premium either, just what they're going for. Since 7950's aren't made anymore but are still really effective for mining they pull about the same price they did new (300 bucks) and sometimes more! I'm just saying that the card will be worth at least 50% what you buy it for in a year from now and it should definitely be part of your investment strategy!
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:29:09
At that point I think some holders could afford to literally go to the moon
@_date: 2013-08-16 18:40:26
I'll build you one for btc....:D

I can't seem to find a link to the conference website...
  
Do you need to purchase tickets? I would really like to go!
@_date: 2013-09-07 00:15:31
Well I think I did this right...my miner is priceb2 
    
I really appreciate you being so cool about this! I'm working on convincing my parents that bitcoin is the future and investing in some btc is a good idea...being able to give them a few tenths would be a great way to get that ball rolling! :D

the parity with the USD and price of gold/oz is a pretty global one...the USD is both the currency of the world super power and was the currency of a good chunk of the second world super power's held debt. Gold is still a universally accepted standard of currency and has been for many years. 
 
the price of silver/oz was a major wall not too long ago for but coin, and although they were much more slight, there were noticable hesitations at many points in Yuan/BTC (often every thousand yuan or so). 
  I think you need to recognize that many of these milestones may have been contextually important many years ago, but with the technology of today many milestones are now globally recognized. I trade mostly in USD for example, but I was watching closely at the trading done in yuan. Also realize that these are milestones to whoever sees them as milestones. As the price of bitcoin (or anything for that matter) is only dependant on what someone is willing to pay for it, there could be any number of situations which induce a panic sell or panic buy, regardless of where its happening.
