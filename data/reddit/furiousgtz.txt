I hate this guy. And he goes on saying. We move 6 trillion everyday. JP is being around for ages. Fiat is still huge. Folks do illegal things with money also. It will never go away. No need to call stupid.

The only hard part is dealing with the naysayers and negative people mentality. That shit drains you. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 11:27:52
