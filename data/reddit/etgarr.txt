Yes, much appreciated.

If possible, get solar panels on your roof or lawn. If that is not feasible, purchase electricity generated by renewables. That should help offset impacts.

Buy tether with ur BTC if you want to take a break from this insanity. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:46:31
IMHO take some profit out or buy tether and wait out tomorrow. You have already won and can always reinvest your winnings. It’s a safe and smart move, I would just hate for you to let go of this feeling. 
Good luck either way!

I’m going to sell my satoshi and buy the dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:08:47
Wow, I cried 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:23:42
So, you got .2 BTC and he got .8 BTC? Am I reading that right?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:33:44
Monero ouch 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:41:50
Yeah, FUD, bye
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:19:45
Don’t forget that it’s probably better to pay in fiat 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:24:30
Street, that is my thought as well. Of course all spec. If they are launching I would assume they have some skin in the game.

Ok so I get it. One entity has two accounts and places a buy order opposite of the sell order,  to manipulate or inflate trade volumes on an exchange.  I heard this occurring on Bitfinex but thought it was getting cleared up. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:54:07
Won’t work because they keep assets on exchanges. Nonetheless I like where you are going with your research.

It’s the journey, there is no finish line

Their message prompt says full verification could take 2 weeks.

Don’t do anything right now. I wouldn’t trust anyone on here honestly, (no offense guys). Take some time, slowly learn about what to do, ask for some help along the way if you need and you will be fine. There is no urgency to get into his wallet now. I just don’t want to see you get burned kid.

Tether 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:05:14
What date was this implemented on?
First Bitcoin I bought was before 10/28 I think.
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:40:40
Only by selling did you permanently lose that money. Sorry bud, like somebody said up there, bite down and buy back in. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:41:23
But....How does this person know you own bitcoin?
Always keep your shit private, even if this is a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:39:27
This afternoon was a good buy IMO

The university will notice the increase in electricity. Not saying don’t do it, just when you jump into it... hit the ground running before they pull the plug. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:16:58
By you opening up about this could have potentially attracted peeps willing to take advantage of your situation which is awful but also the real world. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:02:43
Yeah this will last. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:08:39
Hodl what you have now assuming you bought in btw 5-7.5/8K. If you are interested in short term gains with what you can afford to lose, buy now during this run and sell it on the way down to a dip (which is relative IMO), then buy back some more, hodl. Repeat.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:28:39
Haha NO I am a mess. The USD account I have linked didn’t have sufficient funds d’oh.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:17:38
I remember this
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:05:31

Bitcoin beige, I’m feeling that 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:37:17
Ahhh! Typo. I meant BTH sorry! Haha no I wouldn’t hedge against the real thing.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:25:03
I also have another transaction of bitcoin pending on coinbase, I wonder if that is the issue? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:16:09
Haha I hate that feeling SO MUCH
