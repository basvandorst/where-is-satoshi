It would be great if a mesh like this could achieve some kind of critical-mass usability in a populated area.
I'm not sure how to incentivize running a static mesh node, but now that bitcoin is part of the application space, maybe something is possible.
Imagine something like:
"Buy a mesh node for $X and get $X/2 back in Bitcoin after it's been up for a year"

This seems like a great leg-up for someone getting started, saving a lot of work in setting up good practices.
One feature that would be immensely useful is double-sided printing.  The paper wallets are gorgeous and useful, but it seems strange to fumble through the orientation/alignment of double-sided prints when most color laser printers are already duplex enabled.  (They can print on both sides at once.)  After calibration, I could print paper wallets in one shot.

This (2 of 3) is a strong tool to build on, but still needs a willing third agent for both parties to defer to.
I don't see this as a call for "Regulation", but voluntary arbitration/escrow.  A respected service could charge a small fee to track the package to delivery and release or return the funds.  Vendors that establish their own trust (Overstock?  Amazon?) might function without it, but I just don't see how I'm supposed to use 'digital cash' with most companies.

Yes, bitcoin-0.13.2 runs just fine on a Pi3 with a USB3 (pocket) hard disk.  (Make sure your power supply can power the whole thing without brownouts.)
You can use core's "tc.sh" script to cap the network bandwidth if your provider requires.  I'm holding to 1Mbps now, with good results.
I gave it a small swap file to offload some of the idle tasks, and for now it fits into 78% of the 1GB of RAM.  I expect that at some point the RAM will become a limitation, and it will start to abuse the swap space, but we're not there yet.

Your "Consumer Protection" argument is a bigger problem than most enthusiasts want to admit.
It's so significant that I would rather cash out bitcoin on an exchange and use a credit card to make a purchase, even when "Pay with Bitpay" is an option.  Think about that for a moment.
Why pay for something directly with bitcoin and give up all my FREE buyer protection?  Bitcoin puts complete trust in the merchant to deliver, which limits my spending to local and immediate deliveries.
This really needs a low-friction cheaper-than-Visa escrow agent or third party risk mitigation.  (Purchase insurance?  "Truste" badges?)  Something that gives merchants a way to offer buyer protection.  (Not all will want it, but some will be dead in the water without it.  Ask anyone who bought an ASIC miner with Bitcoin!)

Both true.  Of course, the machine would know or scan the public key and fund it only on dispensing.
I never see traditional plastic store gift cards sold this way in a vending machine, though.  Closest would be self check-out at a grocery store.  I wonder if there are KYC/AML rule around gift cards?
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:10:06
That would be an interesting exercise.. a true vending machine, stocked with Bitcoin paper wallets, like the BestBuy machine-kiosks at airports.  You put in your cash, the dispensing coil turns, a paper wallet falls into the tray, you sweep the funds.

That's a fine idea.. pre-printing double-sided die-cut color blanks with just the codes missing.  Seems like something Canton could add to his catalog. :)
Really though, I would be thrilled if the nice paper wallet output was just two pages (backing is constant) instead of one, so I could print it duplex.

KeepKey is like Trezor with a better display.
The PIN entry and zero-leakage scrambled seed-entry feature in KeepKey are excellent.  The huge display is pretty sweet.
It doesn't have the "passphrase" (multi-wallet/deniability) feature of Trezor or Tezor's established long-term credibility for open-source and smart development.

Even less power on a Raspberry Pi 3 for $90.
* Raspberry Pi 3 with a good power supply.  About $35 to $50 from 
[Element 13]( or 
[Amazon: Vilros Raspberry Pi 3 Basic Starter Kit](
* SanDisk Cruzer 256GB USB3 Thumbdrive $40 at Costco.  (Blockchain is about 110GB now)
* Core Bitcoin (bitcoind) no wallet, no GUI, 100 connections.  v0.13.2 of course!
It uses about 30 to 50% of the CPU and about 70% of the RAM during peak.  A small swapfile has it running just fine (1GB RPi3) as the background services swap out.  Ethernet is reliable, and I haven't had to throttle network bandwidth.
Very low power.. 3 Watts or so.  It's been running for months hands-off.  If you add a crontab entry, it will start the node at boot and run anytime it has power.
Judging from the increase in upload rate, I believe more people are starting to run full nodes (downloading historical blockchain) lately.  This is good!

There is another risk in a spike of Bitcoin dollar value.. malevolent mining.
The Bitcoin network is secure when mining is diverse and profit-driven to cooperation and security.  If the value of bitcoin becomes too large too fast (too fast for incentives to swell the hashrate), then it becomes More Profitable to sacrifice mining&amp;tx-fees, short Bitcoin, and damage the network &amp; market.
If full nodes become too centralized, then that too becomes an attack vector to a well-funded short-trader.  We've seen much larger DoS attacks last year just for LOLs.
Keeping the network secure and functioning indirectly depends on a gradual value increase.

This is a common request -- an Android wallet (or any wallet!) that connects directly to a full node AND supports hardware keys like Trezor.
I have not found one.  The closest match would be to run your own Full Node, your own Electrum (or electrumx) server, and use the Electrum wallet to connect to that.  Now you have hardware wallet with no third-party server.
There are some Android apps that connect to a full node, but none support hardware keys.  Know any?
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:53:52
I hear a lot of "increase the block size" but rarely with quantified statements of How Much.  If you ask a Miner, what's their optimum blocksize?
Most would agree 2MB has little impact.  Blocks will be full again, probably in a few weeks or months.  Any time fees get really low, blocks will be full, and need to grow again.  BU lets this keep happening, if the miners see it as more profitable.
If SW+LN takes off and becomes multiple "Paypal 2.0" companies settling on blockchain, as I keep hearing, would all that traffic have been on the main blockchain instead?  That's the point is making here -- the blocks would have to be gigantic to satisfy the global desire for secure transactions.
I've gone from thinking bigger blocks are the answer to considering they may be completely pointless in a span of a few years.  All this fury and division, and for nothing material.
Layer 2 is already here.  The fees are making Layer 2 and altcoins grow faster than ever.  Do you want to keep Bitcoin relevant to this or see it go stale because it doesn't change?
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:10:11
Sure, what you are saying is relevant for coin value and hashrate, but I'm asking what the full-node network topology would look like if BU forks.  I don't see that resolving itself without someone segregating the networks.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:03:40
There's a healthy discussion over on the RPi3 thread about doing this.  Essentially running a full node + ElectrumX on your own Raspberry Pi and an Electrum wallet with hardware support.  So far, so good.

I tried installing an Electrum server on a stock Debian build and didn't get it working.  Electrumx was easier (on RPi3).  Neither one was to the level of "apt-get install electrum-server", which would be ideal.

Can you explain a little bit about why you see BreadWallet doing this?  
I checked everything I could find online about breadwallet, but it seems like it's an app that connects to their own servers.  This is the 'trust' and single point of failure I want to avoid.  Of course, any lightweight wallet or phone app is going to have to do something like this for good user experience -- relying on a central server to index the transactions.
I'm just looking for a (more heavyweight) wallet that will use a hardware coin manager and connect to any full node for updates and broadcasting.
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:07:08
That's good info.  I didn't know this was an option:




That would be perfect if it supported a good hardware wallet.  (I no longer trust my phone to hold keys.)  It appears not, though.

You have to install a Wallet that uses your hardware key (Ledger, Trezor, Keepkey, etc), and point that lightweight wallet to a transaction database that uses your node.
Trezor -&gt; Electrum Wallet -&gt; electrumx -&gt; your node
It's not easy.  Unfortunately, it appears NONE of the heavyweight (node-connecting) wallets support a hardware keystore.    This means you have to run both a node and a 'transaction server' to be decentralized and secure.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:39:48


I don't know what you consider "expensive", but plenty of people run a full node on a Rpi3 with a small USB hard disk.  Your oldest/smallest drive is just fine, or you can buy everything new for  under USD$100.   That's not a very high bar for a full participation node.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:32:30
No, not true.
Full node (no pruning) runs just fine on an RPi3.  You need to add about 1GB of swap space to give it some breathing room, but it doesn't thrash or crash.
I use a very small microSD card and a USB3 pocket hard disk (for the blockchain), and it runs just fine -- 100% reliable so far.  I have throughput limited and 100 connections.
The whole package is the size of a deck of cards.  Just plug it into ethernet and power, and it does its thing.  This is not hard.
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:51:18
For your (hardware-based) wallet to show your available balances, it needs to make some queries of the blockchain history.  The pocket devices are not high-powered enough to compute or cache all the tx histories, and the wallet+software is usually offline/disconnected/lightweight, so the user-facing software goes to an intermediary server at startup to check transaction history without a full sync.  It is that intermediary server that sits between the full Node and the Wallet.
Mycelium wallet, for example, goes to Mycelium servers, which you can not run yourself.  Keepkey's wallet, same.  Electrum wallet goes to Electrum servers, which you *can* run yourself.  Same for Trezor's wallet software, like says above -- you can run that server.
Basically, ask your self -- what network connections is my Wallet software making?  Who receives those connections and what do they learn about me in the process?   Strong-privacy advocates would like to minimize that surface.
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:43:46
Last I saw, Armory requires a full node to connect to (via RPC).  Most people run both the full node and Armory together, on the same machine. Armory makes its own cache of the transaction history and keeps that in sync with the running full node.
Anyway, to be correct, Armory is not a full node.. it does not accept connections from outside or anything.  It uses no third-party servers, which is why it requires a full node to connect to.

It appears the ETF will follow only one fork, not retaining holdings on both, and they put their weight with the hash power.  And, for only 48 hours of observation.  That's an interesting system to game.  (To "Win" the ETF's shares, a fork only has to have majority hashing for 48hrs, not through the next difficulty cycle.)  Further, there's nothing here about selling off their holdings in a minority fork, like ETC-&gt;ETH.
If passed, they're likely to be the biggest *identified* hodler with a reachable address, so the "economic vote" could be more significant than it is now.

Are you saying that a significant portion of the r/btc BU proponents  would agree to drop emergent-consensus for a straight-up 2MB transaction block fork?  I don't get that impression from reading there.
The same 'compromise' proposal there was mostly derided as "too little" and not wanting to come back for a second increase (4MB etc) in the future.  From what I can tell, they feel quite strongly about  **all** the BU changes and specifically miner-selected block size.  Likewise, most of the opposition here in isn't really about 1-vs-2 MB, but the handover to miners in deciding what happens in the future.  This impacts so many aspects of Bitcoin.. transaction backlog, fee market, node storage and bandwidth requirements, competition between miners, attacks that manipulate backlog and block size.
A straight-up change to 2MB is much easier to safely predict and quantify than BU.  The only real criticism is that it won't have much long-term impact at all.. it just buys a little runway to sort out other scaling options.

And not just for these reasons, but to support healthy privacy, continuity/longevity and decentralization.
With the recent security-leaks, I also consider now that that the HW Wallet "server" admins may have the best intentions, but still themselves get hacked or undermined by actors that want to learn about your HW wallet usage.
I'd love to find a Hardware wallet that connects to a full node with no 3rd-party servers.  Know any?

There's a small python script that you can use AFTER revealing the private key to show that it was made using that method. (after it reveals the nonce used)
If you could spoof a counterfeit opendime, it could go undetected until the private key is revealed (that it wasn't using the intended entropy), so the new anti-fake measures are important.

That's great!  Nice work.
Are you finding that it takes a really long time to sync the electrumx database to the blockchain?  The bitcoind daemon is sync'd, indexed and quiet, but electrumx db preparation is projecting a 16 day ETA.  Did you clone from a faster machine?
I also had to grow the swap file (on hard disk) above 1GB.  It appears to have exceeded 1GB RAM + 1GB Swap after a day of running both daemons.  That's no problem.  The microSD card is only 8GB and doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:57:33
Boy this ain't easy.. I tried building both Electrum and ElectrumX and failed on both.
ElectrumX needs one of: 
"plyvel for LevelDB" or "pyrocksdb for RocksDB"
I was unable to get either to build on Ubuntu.
(RocksDB compiler error)
Electrum failed at the build stage (stock Ubuntu).  I'm also a little queasy of "sudo ./script" steps, but it's an isolated machine so went for it.  I got a number of version mismatch errors on compile.

If the ETF begins operation, it seems like it would be the largest single on-record/verified non-anonymous holder of Bitcoin.
Like it or not, the ETF custodians would become the voice of Bitcoin holders, simply by being reachable and verified.  The media finally has someone to point a microphone at for quotes.

No, to enter your 12/24-word seed on these devices, you do not have to trust any computer.  
You can do it from a USB Battery (Ledger) using the buttons on the Nano S and the display on the device.  It might be tedious, but hey, done in a room with no cameras, it's secure.
KeepKey uses the display to show a rotating cypher for text entry, so the keyboard/screen on the computer can be compromised.
It looks like Trezor went with something like KeepKey?

@_date: 2017-03-29 00:32:20
Would it be twice as secure if the same miners had 2x the investment?
No, it would not.. it would be exactly the same security.  Once you follow this through, you see it's not the hashrate or investment that make it secure, but the diversification of hash power through independent agents.  It's unhealthy when it's so concentrated in a few controllers.

What really happens if the existing distribution of **Nodes** remains constant and the miners change to BU?
Unlike miners, full nodes have no economic incentive to change or follow the hashrate, even under the "BTC loses value" scenarios.  They continue to participate in the 0.14 Core network, validating by those rules.
How does that play out?
Two coins (chains), different rule sets, sharing a dissimilar set of nodes *on the same network ports* advertising to each other?
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:18:56


I wish more people recognized that.  I am not at all enticed by yet-more TH/sec if all that mining is just the same cabal doing it.  That makes Bitcoin less secure, not more secure.  The value comes from predictable security -- mining has to be diversified into many profit-driven actors, not one handful of colluding miners.

Sometimes you have to light a backfire to control the burn... SegWit + a fixed 2MB block would take a lot of the wind out of BU's sails.

It's an excellent question -- I haven't seen a clear answer to "What will block size be optimized for?" under BU.
Considering that BU moves the present and future block size settings to the Miners, I have to assume they will maximize the fees by making it bigger, but not so big that there's headroom and fees drop back to very-low.  Then, "tune" it so that the sum of fees per block is at a maximum, always.
Further, it might be in their economic interest to push it larger to reduce miner competition, even if it reduces fees.
@_date: 2017-03-09 05:53:41
I really do think the majority of nodes would sit there and not change to BU.  What is their economic incentive to switch to a coin with different rules?

I'm in the same boat -- I would like to run a full node, and keep my private keys on a hardware wallet.
In between would be some kind of MyServer+Wallet that can talk to my bitcoind node and manage balances/transactions with all my private keys on the HW wallet.
Reasons are Privacy (broadcast tx directly from a node), robustness, and a healthy distrust of my own computers.
One existing available solution seems to be spinning up an Electrum Server (transaction indexing) and Electrum Wallet with a Ledger:
Server Setup: 
Cold Storage: 
Ledger:  
There are Wallets (breadwallet and Bitcoin Wallet for Android) that will connect to a full node directly, but these don't appear to support a hardware wallet/keys.  (Correct?)
Bitcore / Copay is a server/wallet appears to do most of the right things, and has hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) support through Chrome extensions:
Any others?  Very useful post from and I'm glad he agrees this is worthwhile feedback.

The other thing that has to be 'compromised' (removed) is the emergent-consensus proposal that BU is pushing, where miners can further manipulate the blocksize and effectively push non-China nodes/miners off the network.  I think this is the most worrisome part of it.
It seems unproductive to hold any malleability fix hostage to blocksize arguments.

Mining is just converting electricity to heat &amp; hashrate with some efficiency.  If you can not secure super-cheap electricity, then mining is not just unprofitable but extremely expensive (loss).
Further, if all the efficient ASICs are sold by one company, and they dictate the blockchain, what good would it do to buy them?  We really need more ASIC competition -- if you want to make an impact, hire some excellent chip designers and aggressively make competitive ASICs.

This was **very** helpful, thanks !
Had issues installing libreadline6-dev, needed to downgrade from 6.3-9 to 6.3-8 so changed to this:


Other than that, it was pretty much a walkthrough.
Use "IRC=no" to run a local-only server.
Now the RPi3 (with external USB hard disk) is running a full node, serving full block history, with txindex, and ElectrumX (local use only).  Electrum Wallet runs on a local (LAN) machine with hardware key store.  My server makes no outbound connections except to other Core nodes.
As far as I can tell, this is the most robust (no 3rd party), private, and hack-resistant wallet store available today.
I did have to 'cheat' and use a faster machine to re-index the blockchain on the hard drive quickly, but since the blocks &amp; chainstate are compatible between ARM and X86, that was no problem.  I really feel like this is getting closer to a turnkey "Core Node &amp; wallet".   There is nothing private on this RPi box, and no reason (aside from the 200GB) it couldn't be copied and handed out.  It needs only one port opened on the firewall (8333) if Electrum always connects from inside.

IRA withdrawals after retirement are taxed at ordinary income tax rates.  You avoid taxes when you put the money in (deductible at contribution), but then you pay that tax later on withdrawal.  Bitcoin doesn't really make sense for anyone with a long retirement horizon in this model.  (Roth  would be better)

**Because they believe they would earn less money!**
It's really that simple.   There is far too much pontificating here about how miners have some kind of political/nationalist/ideological/altruistic agenda.  I think that's far overcomplicating things.
It's a big capital-intensive business with high overhead &amp; rapid depreciation.  They will maximize their profit.  Their hardware will be obsolete before the next halving.  This isn't about "The Future"; miners are not hodlers.
So, through that lens, consider the ways Miners could see Segwit as **increasing** profit:
* Increasing value of Bitcoin.  The block rewards are still bigger than fees.  A continued dramatic increase in Bitcoin value is the single biggest way to increase overall miner profit.  Done correctly, this seems like a given.  Can you imagine the price climb with the transaction backlog resolved and governance/scaling being responsibly demonstrated?
* Higher fees possible for L2 settlement.  If L2 takes off, they will stomach much higher fees per transaction than a dice bet or coffee sale.  This sells the "mining service" to transactions that value it the most.
* Stability -- continuity of operation and business as usual.  Risk is bad.  Segwit seems likely to be *less disruptive* to their continued operation than any hard fork proposal.
And the miner's taking the negative "Less Profit" view?
* Transactions moving off-chain, away from mining fees.  Increased competition to the blockchain they mine.  Perception could be this will soon reduce fees and long-term reduce them further if all the big L2 providers settle off-chain.  This is hard to model or predict. Timeline is probably far enough out to be irrelevant to today's miners.
* More Tx per block.  Rapid reduced transaction backlog will have a non-linear decreasing impact on fees.  If we get to No competition for block space, then likely very low fees (again).  This is why BU promises to let miners *control* the blocksize, to maximize total fees.  SegWit doesn't give them control of blocksize.
* Network disruption, profit slowdown.  Risk is bad; fear change.  Any bump in the road (bug, protests, etc) is lost cash.
* Altcoin competition.  If the segwit launch goes poorly, or adoption is low, and Bitcoin loses dominance, the market diversifies into chains they don't mine, maybe even a POW that doesn't match their hardware.  (Faster obsolescence of SHA256 investment)

Is there anything published in the ETF documents that would show a plan for dealing with a (contentious) fork of Bitcoin?
While individual investors along r/Bitcoin and r/BTC could take ideological stances, dumping one fork for the other, it seems the ETF should have a more specified and algorithmic system in place for contingencies.
If the ETF is approved, and has a bit of time to acquire significant investments/holdings, their plan could carry some weight with other investors.. and the miners.

The changes proposed by BU do not make LN any more possible.  A malleability fix is needed, but is held hostage to this blocksize distraction.
Bigger blocks, by themselves, really don't accomplish anything meaningful, but will quickly push nodes (and some miners) off the network.  That's the real risk, bigger than the HF/SF risks.  A 2x or 8x tx-capacity increase is pretty irrelevant in the long-term view.  Fixes that allow many efficient LNs -- that's the 1000x scaling solution that keeps all the nodes relevant.
It's not a simple subject.  I've changed opinion several times by reading, researching and listening.

@_date: 2017-03-07 19:55:03
You have to understand that BU is *not* about 1MB going to *2MB* blocks.  They want a HF to unlimited block size, determined by the miners dynamically.  This is the "emergent-consensus" concept that is the center of BU.  It's permission for the miners to increase the blocksize without another HF or SF.  This changes much more than just the blocksize -- the very dynamics of power and future course would shift.
You're not alone -- most of the community is misinformed in the same way.  The BU campaign is not at all about a switch to 2MB fixed blocks.

This would be a lot more useful if it could be 'reset' and re-used.
The Unseal action should be a button you hold while powering it up, or a simple switch.  Once unsealed, it stays unsealed until Reset, when it erases everything and goes back to factory/sealed condition. 
Factory New/Sealed -&gt; Entropy Loaded-$funded -&gt; Unsealed -&gt; Reset to Factory New

I actually tried both of these.. no power loss or brown-outs, and a USB SSD, and I still got blockchain corruption.  
I'm puzzled as there doesn't seem to be any rational explanation for it.  From what I could tell, bitcoind got into some kind of memory frenzy and crashed.  No filesystem corruption or system crash, just bitcoind.   This happened about four times before I gave up.
The same system has been running ElectrumX for months (through several power losses) without issue, so it was specific to bitcoind.
I was running unpruned with txindex, if that makes any difference.

@_date: 2017-08-23 01:09:09
Right, I'm not discounting the "mental barrier" of re-using an OpenDime, as it already takes a bit of FAQ reading to get comfortable with it.


Precisely as it does today.  Before funding, the owner provisions it with Entropy content, combined with a key-generated nonce.  (Later can be verified to actually source the keys from these.)  The same process would be used a second time (post-reset) to generate new keys for the second life.
As a pessimist and security engineer, I don't assign ANY additional trust to the "physical condition" of the object.  I just assume it was already intercepted in transit, expertly disassembled, reassembled, and hacked 10 ways to Sunday before I received it.  Everything has to follow from the behavior and proofs.

The hardware being cracked-open can be done discretely already, impossible to discern with the naked eye (resistor change, cut trace, drilled via, etc.)  It doesn't really have a visual indicator, but that's not really a problem.


Can you explain more along these lines?  It seems like the same trustless (or, trust-level) could be maintained with a clearly-defined predictable re-use path.
That is, a used OpenDime could be restored to the same condition as a new one in the bag, with the same elements of trust.
Put another way, I would pay at least 2x the price for an OpenDime that could be Unsealed &amp; Reset for re-use.  This is painfully obvious now that all funded OpenDimes need to be destroyed to fork the coins.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:51:14
Alright.  It does make for a small niche of applications though.
Too small a value load and the cost of the OpenDime dominates the fees to where you wouldn't want to unseal it just to fork coins.  You also wouldn't want to give it to someone else in payment, which is ostensibly the main use case.  Too large a value and it's at risk of single-point-loss, with no key backup or Plan B.  So the useable range of values is within that window somewhere.
If it was re-useable (new entropy, new keys, new deposits), then the lower bound opens up quite a bit.
For example, I'd have no problem buying a used/pre-owned Ledger, because their security doesn't depend on being tamper-sealed.  If someone made a re-usable OpenDime, I'd buy that.
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:43:20
I like the OpenDime design.  It's one of those things where everyone looks at it and says "But what if..." and sure enough, there's a FAQ for it.  The short answer is here:
The longer answer is in their published Python code to verify that the entropy provided by the user is really what sourced the private keys (so we (collectively) would catch them later if they were lying about how they arrived at it.)
They do seem to have a trusted Random Number Generator in it for verification links:"Also, a different random nonce is signed each time you power up device. "  So it seems they have all the bits there to re-do the process from factory new.


No reason this couldn't be done a second time with the same level of trust, but maybe their FAQ would have to be twice as long if they did that (Re-seal/factory-reset).  The use cases would expand.. "Here, take this OpenDime, verify it now, see the funds.  Deliver the goods, give me back the empty OpenDime tomorrow and we can do this again next week."

Not at all -- I run my own Electrum server.  You can too.  It's not centralized.   The wallet client normally goes to a pool of distributed servers.
The PC Desktop Electrum wallet can use your own single server (or any specific server), but the Android mobile wallet can not.  (Today, it's pool-servers only, unfortunately.)
I run the electrumx server on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a cheap USB3.0 flash drive -- took forever to sync, but now it's running fine, solid uptime over two weeks.
You have to connect your electrum/electrumx server to a (bitcoind) Full Node with transaction index.  You can run both on one machine.
No swap file, slightly more CPU than bitcoind full node, but still well below max.  This is a pretty lightweight server to run -- just maintains a tx index/database.

This makes just no sense at all.  There is no "lets do both" hard and soft fork; that's just gibberish.  A hard fork is a hard fork.. might as well do Segwit simpler, without the contortions to make it fit into a soft fork.
Second, it's not about two sides wanting soft vs hard forks, it's about widening the blockchain vs developing 2nd-Layer solutions.  That's the essential disagreement.  Also, BU really wants EC more than 2MB, so there's no chance this has miner backing any more than Segwit alone.

Paper means you have to trust whoever printed the private keys, or anyone that handled it.. really, you have to sweep it as soon as you receive it (transaction time) into a wallet you control.  The hologram doesn't accomplish much -- most are easily spoofed/defeated.
So on those fronts, I get it.. OpenDime is a big improvement on paper wallets.
Thinking more about it, I can't think of any reason it couldn't be "reset" with something like a switch, rather than the one-way unsealing.  Re-sealing it should act just like buying a new OpenDime.
If it could be reset/re-used, then it would be more convenient than a paper wallet for handing over coins without a lot of added cost.

RPi3 Electrumx guide is here:
More background here:
The initial sync time is the only thing to twiddle with.  If you have electrumx running on one of your own (trusted) machines, you can copy the DB from there.  I didn't, so I plugged in a fast SSD to the RPi3, moved the bitcoind node to another RPi, and let it just focus on electrumx sync for a while.
Running both bitcoind and electrumx on one RPi3 is possible (with swap file), but it was thrashing the disk with both the DB updates and queries, so would have taken weeks.  Now that it's caught up and stabilized, I might merge them again.

Nobody can guarantee a level playing field.  If you agree that mining is anonymous, decentralized, and international, then you have to accept that any advancement will come without warning or coordination.
BIP-9 introduced Signalling, which had good intentions, but somehow became interpreted as "voting".. that is, "we see your proposed feature, and we could support it, but we don't want it to happen."  This handed control of feature roadmap to the miners.  UASF is an attempt to override this signalling by boycotting the miners who refuse.

UASF is an effort to coax/boycott miners into signalling, so that we can reach 95%.
Without some kind of force or change, there's no chance we get to 95% before the bit expires in November.  That's what's driving the 'urgency' and pace.  After November, it will take a new BIP9 signalling definition (starttime, timeout) to start over with the Hoping.


For Bitcoin mainnet, the BIP9 starttime will be midnight 15 november 2016 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1479168000) and BIP9 timeout will be midnight 15 november 2017 UTC (Epoch timestamp 1510704000).
Segwit won't go away; most likely it will get restarted with a later timeout, at the least.
BIP148 rejects blocks earned by miners not signalling after August 1.  That's the part that worries me.. blacklisting earned bitcoin is not a stabilizing change, and there's your likely fork:


It's not clear that it would have enough actual nodes rejecting blocks come August 1 -- the miners aren't likely to budge unless it's clear to them that many (vast majority) of the network will reject their blocks.  Much of the UASF signalling seems to be comment-only, and it appears unlikely Core is going to release any actual implementation (signed build) of BIP148.  What are node owners likely to do?

I'm no expert, but my Chinese associates explain that there really isn't such a thing as "cheating" or playing unfairly in Chinese culture.  Finding a way to outfox your opponent is laudable and held in high esteem.  Find ways around rules, advantages over your competition, these are all deeply ingrained into Chinese culture as "smart", not dishonorable.
You see it in online games, business relationships, many places where western cultures expect China to play fair.  I really think that any Chinese miner would simply not understand the fuss over AsicBoost.
Honestly, I myself don't get that wound up over it either.  I believe Bitcoin must stand strong against ANY advancement in mining, and never depend on a level playing field.  This won't be the last mining patent, or the last shortcut.  Mining should be anonymous and competitive.  It's just part of the evolution of hashrate, like process node shrinks and gravitating to free power and cooling.
If it weren't for the misguided (bad idea, imho) of miner "signalling", we'd already have SegWit blocks and it wouldn't be an event at all.  This whole nonsense about miners blocking SegWit is only possible because of this new "voting" system that has no place being there.

Ledger Nano + Mycelium does the same thing, also KeepKey.
With these hardware wallets, you have a choice.  You can Watch your HD accounts and see the live balance updated under Mycelium Accounts, or you can keep them fully offline/unwatched and spend from Cold Storage on demand only.
Under Mycelium -&gt; (Key+) Add New Account -&gt; Advanced  -&gt; Add Unrelated Account, there are now three Import Trezor/KeepKey/Ledger HD buttons.

I wish there was a way to do something similar with my own full Bitcoin Core node.  I can run a node with transaction indexing, and my own electrum/electrumx server, but the Android Electrum client won't use it -- it only uses the pool servers.  Even the desktop client will only use a custom server for transactions, and apparently still connects to other servers for crosschecks.  Mycelium is close, but must use their servers to look up your balances, which is a privacy leak.  Some Android clients are direct-node-connecting (BreadWallet, Bitcoin Wallet, Samourai), but don't support hardware wallets.  Mycelium has the best support for hardware wallets, IMHO, but you have to use their server.

If I was in your position, I would:
* Fix your Ledger connection.  99% certain there is nothing wrong with it, and your PC just isn't set up correctly.  You jumped right to "My Ledger is broken!" without doing enough study to see why.
* Once your Ledger is connecting again, wipe that phone where you entered the recovery seed.  The security of your hardware wallet is already compromised by entering the secret seed (into an Android phone), but might as well mop up.
* Never use that wallet again.  Wait for your incoming transaction, then sweep it off the Ledger.  Avoid receiving anything else.  You compromised the seed backup; it's not ideal any more.
* Reset the Ledger altogether.  Make a new seed. Back it up correctly and never enter it anywhere else. (You still have your written backup of the old seed if you ever really need it)
* Use that new seed/wallet for any future transactions on the Ledger.
* If you want to watch the old/compromised seed for unexpected transactions, you can do that.  (Mycelium or Sentinel or something)

This device locally generates paper wallets and multi-sig wallets for printing, without any PC or network connection.

The OpenDime is a pretty crazy idea.. essentially a hardware sidechain!  A "Bitcoin Piggy-bank" was the best description.  It seems well-designed and has good answers for all the usual concerns.
As Bitcoin gains value, my main issue with OpenDime is that it's inherently not backed-up.  It can't be backed-up, just like cash.  If you put a whole BTC on it, and it gets fried by static shock, dropped in the gutter, or sent through the washing machine, the BTC is gone.  If you put much LESS value in it, then you've burdened your 0.010 BTC with a consumable cost of around USD $15, and would be reluctant to give it to anyone in trade.
I suppose I would be happy to receive an OpenDime as payment, but not so eager to spend one.
This means funds will accumulate on one unit until they're uncomfortably large and worth breaking open the piggy bank.
I wonder if it could be made safe and "re-usable".. perhaps by resealing via switch, reverting to factory-new condition (ready for new entropy and deposits).  Then you could sweep the funds off it and re-use it for a lesser amount.

I like your post.  Thinking about the future beyond scaling.


The single biggest difference between Bitcoin and other assets is the ownership of the private keys -- true ownership and sole control.  Regardless of wallet, exchange, or other facilities, every user has to decide if they will hold their own private keys.
Regardless of the scaling or forking future, the system has to permit users to hold their own keys and meaningfully transact with them.
Any useful wallet will permit this, and most (all?) do.  Some will store your keys for you, encrypted with their own sauce, but I think most users today demand strong key retention.  The hardware key stores (Trezor, KeepKey, Ledger) have made this very accessible, and seem to sell out as soon as they appear.  I see this as a huge step in Bitcoin's lifecycle -- you can run the wallet of your choice without transferring your coins or your keys.
For Exchanges, you are correct -- fast transactions require converting your actual Bitcoin into a "balance" in someone's account system.  I'm hoping post-SegWit L2 options will make a more-trustless exchange possible, where you could transact quickly while still holding your own keys.

"You can run one of these.  In fact, you should."

You're assuming the other 17% is not-signalling or anti-segwit, when all they said is that they are "not represented here".  I doubt you'd find 17% objecting.

You just said it wouldn't be stupid at all -- it would be fully within their power, and everyone would have to follow, since the miners make the rules?  You see how stupid this sounds?
There's also the "first mover" problem.  The first miner to make up their own rules will generate blocks nobody wants, while the bulk of the miners carry on with Bitcoin.   Every move has to be coordinated, and telegraphed in advance.  As they do that, it opens an opportunity for miners to see where they would make the most money, and even exchanges to trade tokens on it in advance.

I think maybe you don't understand how the blockchain, a public ledger, actually works?

To agree with you, the real challenger then are the altcoins with increasingly good censorship-resistance.
I'm looking at Litecoin.. what is Bitcoin's advantage over Litecoin?  The SHA256 hash power is overly concentrated, and Litecoin has all the stuff you would want from Bitcoin (Segwit, faster confirms, more block capacity).
At what point does Litecoin's network, nodes &amp; hash rate have an equivalent censorship resistance to bitcoin?

I think this is the key difference in our perspective.  You seem to believe that anything done by the majority of miners is "Bitcoin", when it's not.  Just like bad blocks were orphaned before, any miner that "chose to do something else" does not leave me with a choice to comply (change my rules) or leave (form another coin).  It is that miner's block that has already left.  It won't get propagated, and the wallets won't see it.
The miners want to sell their earned coins.  If they mine something that nobody is following, who cares?  They won't be able to sell those coins to me or anyone else that checks if the rules are being followed.

I read it.  It wasn't hard.  There's nothing in there to support what you are saying.  In fact, there are considerations given (composite constraints, rather than separate base &amp; witness) to keep it simple for miners to calculate maximum fees in a block.

Once the Miners finally confess that they can smell the $$$ from China, get behind Segwit at the last hour, and pump BTC, it's going to be dramatic.
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:01:22


To start with, no, bcoin does not have the code because the PR was not accepted.  It's chjj's proposal, more of a troll than a real contribution, as you can see from the comments.  chjj: "Closing for now. I will release a plugin which implements this behavior (in the works)."
So when you said "bcoin has code specifically for that", you are not being honest.


You haven't explained how.  It's okay to say you don't understand it.
The PR was for code that would take transactions from the SegWit-enabled chain and replay them onto a chain that did not observe SegWit. Further, it would require miners that will mine them for the 30% bribe.  (Of course, that really leaves you wondering why the miner would pay 70% to the bcoin user, instead of taking 100% for themselves.)
Let's review a few things.
BIP148 is about *signalling*.  Signalling readiness to accept SegWit.  This is not activation, so no user anywhere would be actually sending SegWit transactions until activated. 
If BIP148 is a success, then that chain will see &gt;95% of the miners signalling segwit, causing the lock-in.  Now those miners would be ready to process segwit transactions in 2 weeks, on that chain.    If a miner on that chain attempts to "steal" a segwit transaction, like you are describing, then the other miners on that chain would have to agree to build on it, and the nodes would have to agree to accept the theft.

The whole point of UASF is that it really can't end in multiple coin forks.  If UASF succeeds, it eats the main chain in one bite.  If UASF fails, well, that outcome is more strange and hard to predict.  Maybe it languishes with slow confirmation times for two weeks?
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:48:07

That's certainly NOT the impression I'm getting from rBTC and miner statements.  They simply don't want (any) off-chain scaling, for rather transparent reasons.
Some have gone as far as to call malleability a "feature" that should require a very long time before fixing. (This is to block off-chain.)

@_date: 2017-05-28 20:42:10


Nope.  If the miners all hold a Roundtable tomorrow and decide they should be awarded 50BTC per block ("As Did Satoshi!"), and start mining that, it doesn't change Bitcoin.  Users will still want to trade Bitcoin, and some miners will still want to make valued blocks, so there you go.
Miners are your employee or vendor.  You are the customer for the blocks they mine.  They do work, they get paid (through inflation and fees).  If they want to do different work, well, it's a free market.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:11:33
I don't think so.  2MB blocks will have no headroom and fee competition will still be there.
It's a strange function for sure.. low fees until there's more demand than (transaction) supply and bam, you have to step over another transaction to make it into the next block.
Transaction volume is scaling up so fast that talking about a single hardfork to 2MB is just delusional.  The honest folks are asking for 8MB or "let the miners decide" size, while it's easy to see that if this growth keeps up for years, it will be completely impossible to avoid Layer 2.   Enabling many Layer 2 solutions it the path to true scaling.

Ah, so it's a matter of degrees, then.. Miners are free to change some of the rules?  Most of the rules?  Is there a list?  Or maybe it's codified somewhere, like in the nodes?

Look at what happened to BU.  It was effectively dead after the memo from exchanges said it would be listed as "BTU" and traded against BTC.  That was it -- all it took.  Clarity on the future.
UASF can succeed the same way.  When it's obvious to miners that the Value is in the UASF direction, they change.  They have to. 
 But it's up to the Users to present that direction as Inevitable and Valuable.  BIP-148 hasn't done that.  It has an air of "maybe" to it, and there is no futures market to make a stake in.

I want Segwit/BIP141, but **detest and do not appreciate UASF/BIP-148** as a means to get it.
I want the Segwit outcome, but do not agree with this method of "boycotting" valid blocks to get it.  It's out of line with Bitcoin's main value proposition: Decentralized, censorship-resistant money.  UASF is an example of forced decision-making.. specifically designed to force a change by a minority of nodes.  That's bad precedent, and a bad governance step for Bitcoin.
Without a majority of UASF hashpower, **the chain would split**.
For the first time, every release of every Core-signed client will be out of compliance with some part of the miner and node network.  That's exceptionally **disrespectful and reckless as a development process** for Bitcoin.
Imagine this happened often -- every month some subset of the network boycotting blocks to get their favorite protocol/consensus improvement!    What a mess.
Status-quo (no change) is not broken, and maintains Bitcoin's strong consensus.  No amount of spam or interesting/competitive altcoins changes that.  The ONLY truly unique feature of Bitcoin is that it has no central authority.  It resists change.
Now.. I also run UASF nodes with BIP148 enforcement.  Why, if I do not approve of the BIP?  Because having been set in motion, I still want No Chain Split.  The only way to avoid chain-split is for UASF+Segwit2x to succeed in the rapid deployment.  I want Segwit2x to stick to their timeline and bring Segwit Activation to avoid a chainsplit, so running UASF and transacting with it makes that more likely.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:53:17

Well, your timing is perfect.. transactions are **On Sale** lately, so you can fold all these coins into one UTXO for about 1 satoshi/byte.
Don't overspend for your transaction, as you seem to have patience to wait a bit for it to clear, and then you can spend the result later with lower fees.
My guess is that you have actually overstated the "0.01 BTC" and actually received a bunch of "dust" from someone who was sending those out to public addresses around 2015.  I can't see any other way to end up with 100 values of the same amount.  It's not zero, but it's not much either.
If it's really 0.01 BTC, then good on you.  I'd still combine them now while the fees are lower.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:25:05
Here you're trying to create some equivalence between miners harmlessly "ignoring segwit tx" (ok, because it's a compatible soft-fork) versus modifying and mining transactions for theft: "by mining a transaction that spends my anyone-can-spend transaction without including the witness."  This means they went out of their way to get the transaction (by claiming Segwit enablement) and then changed the transaction to fool other miners that are not Segwit-enabled.
But let's look at the main difference between BIP148 and something like BIP149.. Time.
BIP-149 says "Its happening in a year, sooner if you make it".  BIP-148 says "It's coming in ~two months".
BIP-148 is speedy, rushed.  There wasn't enough time to enable a futures market, build out clients, talk through the scenarios and reach agreement by the markets and users.  Because it's so fast, it has no air of "inevitability" -- it's not certain, it's shaky, and the failure outcomes are scary.  Both replay and reorg threaten to destabilize the network because the outcome is not certain.
Imagine a BIP-14x that says "Two weeks!  You have two weeks and we split!" and it becomes obvious these are not on level playing fields.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:33:53
I agree.
One thing Segwit has as an advantage is timing.  If miners signaled en mass, we could be running it in four weeks.  There is no other code change "more ready" to go live.
ANY other proposal, however popular, will take a year or more to gel into specification, test, and make it through deployment-readiness.  Maybe that doesn't matter because Bitcoin has enough users satisfied with status-quo to sustain it until then?
Your point about the weekly flush-out of the backlog is interesting.


@_date: 2017-05-13 22:22:07


Why do you believe that SegWit is a "centrally fee planned" solution?
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:36:17
You sure they're different 'addresses'?
Each payment to any address, even the same address, results in a transaction-output, what Bitcoin Core calls "Coins".  These are spendable values, even to the same address.. so one address could really contain hundreds of spendable values.
To spend them, you have to provide a signature for each one, so if you spend them all in one transaction the total size will be rather large.  This is why you want to be careful with fees, and do one Spend of all them to the same (or different) address with a fee held low.
Then wait, and see if it confirms in hours or days.  When you go to spend it next time, it will all be in one Coin (utxo) that you can spend for less anytime.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:31:47
1) All of the NYA signatories (80%+ hashpower) will support the UASF by running Segwit2x and signalling Bit1, if they keep to the planned schedule and comitments.  You can see the NYA list for details.
2) Nope.  UASF nodes would boycott blocks that still refuse to signal for Segwit (BIP141), just like activated NYA/Segwit2x does.  By August 1 it will be moot anyway, because Segwit2x will have Segwit properly activated in time to avoid UASF.
3) The support for UASF comes from the standoff between Miners (who have blocked Segwit) and much of the community who wants to see larger blocks (more tx per 10minutes) right away, and enable Layer2 with Segwit.  UASF says "Enough stalling.. Do it by August 1".  Segwit2x says "Okay okay, we'll do it, but we also want a 2x doubling of block size in 90 days".
The date to watch is July 21, when miners should start activating their Segwit2x BIP91 signals and set the thing in motion to avoid any disagreement on August 1.

Try as I might, I simply can't bring myself to care about ASICBoost.  Not at all.
It has all the smell of mock outrage to keep bringing it up like it's some kind of Segwit banner to rally behind.
I've read all the posts, I get it.. I see what it does, and I keep coming back to Ethereum and the DAO hack/fork.  Code.  This is how Bitcoin works.  If there's a way to hash faster by mashing the data aside from the nonce, then that's how it works.
In a perfect system, the miners would be totally faceless, anonymous, and working in their own best interests.. that means smaller more efficient ASICs and every possible shortcut they can take.  Clever wins.  Hashrate goes up, difficulty goes up, Why do I care?

@_date: 2017-07-04 19:59:57
First, I totally understand how this could be confusing.  It's not simple or obvious stuff, so you have to do a bit of study and testing to see how it works.
Mycelium has its own seed, for its own software wallet with keys stored in your phone.  That's probably where your "Secure my Funds" screen and key words are coming from.  You should write those down somewhere, just in case you accidentally use the Mycelium software wallet.  Some people choose to use that software wallet as "hot funds" so you can spend coins without having your Nano S.  You can safely ignore it, if you have no plan to use it.
This is completely separate from your Nano S.
Your Nano S will give up the private seed words only once, via its own screen.  You did this already, as you said "backed up the 24 word seed from hardware".  You're good there.  Keep those words safe, and never enter them anywhere.
Now, when you connect your Nano S to the phone, and unlock it with PIN, and "+Add Key" in Mycelium, what it's actually doing is getting your XPUB key from the device.  Mycelium adds that to its account view.
With that Public seed, Mycelium can ask the network for all your balances on that Nano S, even without having the private key or any way to spend your coins.  It's like a "Watch Only" address.  Mycelium can show your live updated balance, but can't sign anything or spend funds without you attaching the device again.  You can safely "delete" this key from Mycelium any time you like, or even after each transaction, if you don't want this displayed.
It's worth noting that Mycelium handles Trezor/KeepKey differently than Nano S.  As far as I know, it does not fetch the XPUB key from these, so it doesn't keep the account listed.  It can't "Add Key" for these devices, but it can use them to sign transactions as a spend from Cold Storage.  They don't remain listed.  Please correct me if this is old info, but it's worth noting that Ledger != KeepKey/Trezor handling.

If I understood correctly, they're actually "safer" because they've never been reused.  That is, nothing has ever been signed with the private keys.

You can't.   Mycelium only supports the (three?) mycelium central servers.  You can not run your own, or point their server to your own node.

Seriously though, if 95% BIP141 signalling was going to happen before August 1, it would take a blacklist/boycott effort of the 51% led by Jihan or someone who really really wanted to see it happen.  I'm going to round-up to "impossible" for now.

All this energy should go toward keeping the spotlight on the 80% NYA agreement and making sure all those miners follow through for a seemless uneventful upgrade.
Otherwise, the problem is that this 'split' is likely to be temporary or very short.  It's not a persistent clone of Bitcoin like Coinbase's statement on BTU.
Without replay or wipeout protection, they really can't promise their customers anything at all.  They're subject to the same nonsense as all of us.  One chain could slow, stop, vanish, or re-org.
My guess is that if things really do look like they're all going to hell at the end of the month, most exchanges/business will just suspend operations on Bitcoin until a clear path emerges.
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:08:51
As far as I know.. Ledger has two accounts on device (separate PINs for 'with' and 'without' password?) and temporary accounts if you enter the derivation password for each (tedious).  Is that correct?
How does Trezor do the seed+password variations?

The deployment plan is for **miners** to run this on testnet5 
not the main chain, so it's expected that you won't see it on the production network.  Those nodes are arguably a mistake.
Further, it's not really for Users.. only Miners need to run it (to coordinate their oddball BIP91/Bit4 80% signal).  Anyone not mining can't signal Bit4, so should run BIP148 instead.
All clients/wallets/exchanges are ready for August 1 (because it's a soft fork), so there's nothing much to do but wait and signal UASF/BIP148 for support.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:18:49
Looks like their spec &amp; documentation are out of sync with the code?
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:50:39
With all respect, I can't go along with the twisted language used here to re-frame BIP148 as normal and standard while accusing every other node of being out of consensus.  That's just the weirdest flavor of nonsense, and dilutes the strong position you could otherwise take for making a UASF.
I know this is your standard statement, and I understand what you mean by it, but I think it's misleading and disingenuous to present it as an inverted position.. that "BIP148 is not causing a chain split but miners are".   and the "51% attack" label being hurled at miners who are running the dominant (mainline) Core consensus code.  That's not fair or correct.
There is a tremendous amount of credibility, stability, and proven "uptime" that earned Bitcoin such a respected and dominant position.  There is a whole ecosystem of software (back-end processing, chain analysis, payment systems) and trust built on 
 that stability and predictable behavior.
BIP148 throws a wrench into this, and dishonors all of Bitcoin's long-term stability by mandating a "change or split" on such a short timeline.  A long-term chain split with two diverse transaction histories, replay mess, and a re-org threat would be disastrous. 
 It simply isn't a price worth paying for accelerated Segwit adoption.
BIP141 was authored and implemented with that unfortunate 95% signalling bar.  Bitcoin can recover from a failed proposal and re-do the Segwit launch with better consensus, while still maintaining the high standards that make it valuable.
I write this just to note it for anyone who reads these comments, but fundamentally, you and I disagree on how much value to place on stability and predictable blockchain behavior.  I don't expect this to change, and recognize that everyone has their own reasons for valuing Bitcoin.

Thanks.  Will it be prepared by August 1?  If Segwit2x keeps their word, we will see Segwit transactions two weeks later.  How will Bitpay handle these if the implementation isn't ready in time?
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:49:30
The only possible way for there to be "no split" is if BIP148 gets 95% BIP141 signalling before August 1, or zero hashrate on UASF chain.
Given that both of these are impossible, we can assume at least a temporary chain split -- a uni-directional network partitioning.  How should an exchange, or anyone holding your private keys, handle this correctly?
The exchange (or some other agent) will likely relay/replay transactions between the two chains, so some will confirm on both.  Some will not.  Once the newly-minted coins appear on each chain, it gets more messy if the split persists far enough to see them spent.
A user with their own private keys is in a better position, as they can select which chain to broadcast on, and which one to use for confirmation.  The real mayhem happens if UASF takes off, with enough mining to stay alive.  Then the entire non-BIP141 chain vanishes in a reorg any time it gets longer.  An exchange that promised transactions based on that chain could be in trouble.

I added that part about conspiracy, because it's popular fodder in r/Bitcoin.
My point is that some future UASF may also succeed, if it actually does have widespread support and low miner approval.  It's not as simple as UASF vs CASF/MASF, but the proposal and timeline itself.
BIP-148 was intentionally FAST and also intentionally divisive, inducing a chain split.  Both of those are unpopular.

That's one good way to put it.. I want Segwit, and Segwit would be great, but it's not worth splitting the network, as BIP148 does.
I don't share the technical concerns about Segwit itself, just the rush-deployment mechanism to override BIP9.
The good things in Segwit are simply not worth destroying the stability and continuity of the blockchain just to rush it into play faster.  Bitcoin has been fine without it, and will be fine without it a bit longer while a better launch coordination is worked out.

7. UASF will actually *decrease* Core's standing and repute.  Once it fails, the market will see it as a failure to wrest control away from the miners.  It also legitimizes alternative clients, since that's the only way to UASF.
8. If UASF shows any promise of actually growing a chain, the anti-SegWit miners will need reorg protection. What better way than to hardfork into larger blocks?  "We had to do it to save you from the re-org risk!"

You're fine.  Hardware wallets are better (in some cases) because you can apply a PIN number.  This way if you lose your hardware wallet, at least the thief can't get to the funds.  Maybe for an off-site backup, this makes sense.  If you write down your seed, then you're really in the same boat as a paper wallet (written seed, printed private key, same risk).
Make sure it's good paper/ink, and check it now and then to make sure it's not sticking to itself or fading before 2023.  Take precautions against water/fire damage, etc.

Most of your responses are discussing the security of the OpenDime.  I see a different concern.
If you put a significant amount of BTC on OpenDime, there is no way to back up that private key, so you have a single point of loss.  (Damage to the OpenDime, loss, etc)
If you put a small amount of BTC on an OpenDime, then the cost of the unit itself makes it too valuable to trade as off-chain payment.
Transaction fees would have to be much higher to make it attractive to give away an OpenDime rather than conduct an on-chain transaction.
These might be useful if you expect to swap back and forth BTC with one person or group, like poker chips or IOUs.  Anyone can cash out at any time, but the net cost of units stays low because you're getting them back over time.

As far as I know, Electrum (&amp; ElectrumX) don't really have a BIP148 policy or anything.  It all depends on which full (indexed) node you put them behind.
Unfortunately, the Android Electrum client doesn't let you use your own Electrum server, and will still pick one from a pool only.  I don't know how you determine whether the chosen server is UASF or not.

What I didn't expect is that many of the Core developers are taking the position that bitcoin is not-screwed by not-scaling.  That is, status quo is a pretty good value proposition, and they're comfortable with keeping it as many years as it takes to reach consensus.
If the market feels differently, and can't change Core's view on Segwit2x, the end result is that another client will rise to prominence to satisfy that market.

If you continue using Core, you stay on the chain with the vast majority of nodes that are also running Core.  Every signed binary ever released will be right there with you.

Because that's actually more complicated and risky than staging it.  It's a myth that hard forks are simpler code.  You would be throwing away years of testing and refinement, as well as a successful launch demonstration on Litecoin.


I believe this is the real reason for most of the vocal push to delay Segwit.  If Segwit shows promise to relieve congestion through successful scaling, it will be harder to convince users to HF.  Conversely, if Segwit does little to relieve the pressure in the next 90 days, the HF will have very widespread adoption to bigger blocks.

We will have Bitmaincoin (HF), Core 0.14.1 same as today, and UASF on August 1.  If NYA produces a client, then there's that too, but it's not going to have an impact on the Core chain right away.
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:03:06
That sucks.
It's also possible that the UASF chain gets to November (very slowly) without having completed the 95% for an activation period.  In the 106 days of BIP148 miners need to make 2016 UASF blocks (best case!), so it needs to mine no slower than ~7x the current rate.  (75 minutes per block)
Otherwise we have two chains, branched from August 1, **neither one with SegWit**, both being extended...

It's not 4-8MB blocks.  It's 4 Million Weight units in (August 1) Segwit BIP141 code, and 8 Million Weight units in the proposed 90-day Hard Fork.
You must internalize the block weight as a metric of size, not bytes.

I've followed the entire thread and narrative and don't give two shits about ASICBoost; never have.
I don't see this as the flag to fly in favor of scaling Bitcoin.  Miners are free to hack and optimize any which way they can.  Imagine they are faceless, anonymous, and known only by the blocks they submit.. get used to that idea, and improve Bitcoin to deal with it.
It's a pretty niche audience that cares about ASICBoost too.  Much better to emphasize scaling, applications, and other benefits to SegWit and growth.
Seriously, get over it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:55:39
Not at all.  I read everything I can find on ASICBoost.  I get it.
If anything, ASICBoost is a bug in Bitcoin's PoW statement, not an "attack".  Miners are going to find every advantage they can, as it should be.  Stop trying to turn this into some kind of populist uprising against the miners, and we'll get further on protocol improvement and SegWit.

Electrum Servers are transaction/balance database servers that sit in front of a Bitcoin Node.
Electrum desktop client lets you specify which Server to use (or take from a random pool).
Electrum Android does not let you specify any server of your choice, but you can pick one from a list.
It seems like "Electrum" supports either UASF or not-UASF or a randomly-selected server?

No, Google Authenticator does not backup, restore, or clone your keys.  You have to re-register all 2FA on the new phone.
Google Authenticator is not related to Authy, but Authy can use the same 2FA seeds to perform the same function.

Alright, just don't expect people to join the parade on merits.  Segwit should be about enabling L2, lower fees, more tx confirms a block, future growth.  Things that resonate with users.  ASICBoost is a manufactured boogeyman.  Miners should cheat/optimize/improve any way they can.  They're not accountable to anyone but the code.
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:53:33
Further, the UASF BIP148 has a termination date hard-coded.  At the end of BIP148, it folds back to the main one, so it's not unbounded either.  There simply can't be a long-term BIP148 chain without taking over, so trading against the two makes no sense.
People think there's going to be a BU vs Core &amp; ETH-vs-ETC trading going on, but that's just uninformed delusion.

I'm thinking as hard as I can, and can't think of any advantages for 1 of 2.  Same seed on both units would give a clone, still PIN protected.
"1 of" anything seems like a weird multisig scenario.

There is no backup option.
I'm certain there wasn't a few months ago, and I just checked and found no new options.
When you backup &amp; restore a phone, the Authenticator keys are all empty.
Google Authenticator has nothing to do with SMS.  It doesn't use it for anything.  Where are you getting this from?
Load the app up and walk us through the SMS and Cloud restore here.. I'm not seeing it.

The nice thing about paying direct is getting the amount just-right.  Buying a gift card requires some amount of pre-planning and pre-commitment.  Maybe you change your mind, end up spending less, computed the shipping/tax incorrectly.. some of the gift cards can also take up to a day to arrive, so you miss out on sale/coupon deals.
It is definitely easier to pay direct, so I'm sorry to see this option go from yet another merchant.
This same forum celebrated each new addition to mainstream buying once.  I miss those days.

Very differently.  Mycelium does a Cold Wallet spend for KeepKey, and does not watch balance or remember it.
For Ledger &amp; Trezor, it extracts the XPUB keys (?) and then adds a watch-on wallet.  You can see the live balance and receive (generated rx keys) without the hardware wallet.
I don't know why the two are treated differently.

Asicboost is a boogeyman.  Nobody cares.  The next miners will have other tricks to hash faster, and I can't muster a yawn.
Status-Quo is the most strong position, and Bitcoin's favorite.  Ain't broke.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:44:14
That's not correct.  Segwit2x nodes will lock in the change when 80% of miners signal readiness to do it, then, after a lock-in period, they will reject mined blocks that don't signal Segwit readiness (Bit1/BIP141).  Just like UASF/BIP148.
With this filter, 95% BIP141 activation will be reached, and Segwit starts for real.
The difference here is that it's the Miners doing it, so Core won't see any non-Segwit blocks.  They'll just see 95% signalling and an orderly activation.  Good times.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:09:14
But to spend from Ledger?

Yup.  Print the QR codes on paper before scanning, keep them in a safe place, and re-use them on your new phone.  Clone all you like, and move to a new phone in a minute or less.  It just comes down to whether you want to 'invalidate' the old phone or not.

I've searched the blockchain from May 18th to today and found no transactions with these output values.
It could be that the "Multisig" is messing with things, or the dates shown here are client dates rather than transaction dates, not sure.

Imagine the device had no "breakway" tab or poke-hole.
It starts off factory-fresh, the user provisions the entropy, and payments are sent to it.
Eventually, the holder pushes a button to 'unseal' it and reveal the private key.  Now it's in unsealed state, ready to redeem.
Then, the owner writes the "reset" file to it.. the device resets all content, discards keys, and goes back to Factory new.
It doesn't seem like this has introduced any new attack vectors compared to breaking the tab.  What do you see as added risk?

I disagree.  It would be better for Bitcoin's continuity if all cards were on the table leading into July, long before August 1.
You want everyone to state their intentions and their moves, to avoid any surprise or thrashing around the chains, Bitcoin price, participants, etc.
In any case, those miners are offline because they're obsolete, and the sum total of them won't make a blip on hashrate.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:48:53
Code that works to activate BIP141 will be ready in time -- it already is.  I agree that the HF will take more time to sort out, but they have 90 days from August 1.

Sooo... you're not Nakowa?
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:48:00
Worst case?
The BIP148 chain mines so slowly as to be useless (no confirmations, yuuuge backlog).  All transactions will mirror from one side to the other, with complicated repercussions.  Nodes that actually want to transact will eventually change their code to concede defeat and revert to the Legacy chain.  The legacy chain is also plummeting in value as nobody wants to transact.   ~~In November, the BIP148 chain would vanish, and all transactions on it forgotten.~~  (I was wrong about this)
Nobody buys miners' fresh coins because the entire market sits this one out to see how it resolves.
Worser case is that this takes a LONG time to sort out, so more and more transactions take place on a chain that will be wiped out or stop, irreparably destroying Bitcoin's stability/credibility and value.  Terrified users sell for LTC &amp; ETH, which eats so much of Bitcoin's market cap that it relegates it to second-page altcoin status.  Miners go broke because their SHA256 hardware is suddenly unable to break even.  Hashrate falls through the floor and even the leading chain goes through a very long difficulty adjustment.
Once the chain difficulty adjusts, it's clear there is "more than half" of the world's ASICs idling offline, so nobody trusts anything.
Basically, Armageddon.
OR.. Best case.. 80% of Miners follow through with the NY Agreement, get BIP141 signalling by August 1, and it's a non-event.  A few miners late to the party upgrade their software to keep up, and we have 95% activation.  SegWit lights up in August and everyone goes back to trading.
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:54:08
This is good to point out.  It is surprising to most people who try it that ETH or LTC doesn't have a "different seed".  Okay, maybe just me.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:47:44
Yes, you're right.  I read it again, and the BIP148 rules stay in place for that period of blocks.   After that date, non-signalling miners are allowed again, but they will have a different divergent history of transactions and blocks.
I can only describe this as "even worse".
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:52:58
We shouldn't.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:27:25
Even more secure would be if they would support hardware wallets, like Mycelium.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:51:06


At that slow a mining rate, the UASF chain would not get SegWit.  November would come and go without enough signalling blocks, and both BIP148 and BIP141 would end without SegWit activated on either chain.
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:08:52
No, that's not true at all.  They did the work to find the hash at the proscribed difficulty.  If they found a shortcut, it can only be described as a bug in the algorithm or stamping of it.   Blame for this is ALL on Bitcoin design.  People who declare the Ethereum DAO hack as sacred should totally understand this perspective.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:05:12
Soft-forks are always preferable -- the whole economy can upgrade their clients on their own timeline.
Also, timing.  To 'reset' BIP141, let it time out in November and deisgn/code/test a new Segwit implementation around HF with some other stuff from the wish-list... well, that would set us back at least a year or two.  Segwit SF is ready to go right now.
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:13:11
Once witnessed, what is anyone going to do about it?  Miners should be faceless, anonymous, and visible only through blocks appearing in the network.  I don't have to trust them, or know who they are.
If there's a shortcut to mining, that's a bug in Bitcoin for all to exploit.

Then proceeds into a long-winded explanation that yeah, it actually does increase the transaction capacity every block.  As in, more transactions possible in expected every 10 minutes.  The kind you might call a "capacity increase"

Well, one could make engraving patterns for all the individual digits.
Pencil the phrase on the titanium, then go and laser-engrave each individual digit in random order while positioning the plate to receive it in the right place.
Probably need a hell of a laser to make a mark as deep as that stamp, though.
For the Kickstarter, you could probably spec out an alphanumeric stamp kit (of the right size) and just point people to it on Amazon.  They're not expensive, and have continued use.  I'm not thrilled about the decimal format..  too ambiguous and verification-heavy.

Bitcoin is the most decentralized.  Nobody is in charge.  This whole long scaling debate is just proving the strength of status-quo as a viable position.
There's nobody to bribe, nobody to sue, nobody to arrest or conscript or hire to force a change or agenda. It has the most hashing power investment, distributed worldwide, the most software support, and the longest track-record of system security.
That's a lot of value.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:14:25




The Core Miners (not economic nodes) may build on a block from another non-Segwit2x miner.  The thinking here is that with 80%+ participation on Segwit2x, that chain will not extend, and the 20% of miners not participating will get orphaned on the regular, for the 2wk/2016blocks activation period of Segwit BIP141.  After that, those blocks won't be rejected.
The economic nodes would have nothing to do with this, and would just see brief 1-block reorgs.
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:37:04
No, it's not.  If you want to see Bitcoin death-spiral, keep two chains alive with the risk that all transactions can be undone.  It won't even be in the top-20 by market cap before it resolves.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:24:49
Ah, alright.. that makes more sense.
Yeah, if your server lets you "undo" 2FA by SMS, you're screwed.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:23:58
Right.  My point was that there can't be a real market for BIP148 Coins vs Legacy Coins.  This is not at all like ETH/ETC.
The temporary chain-split from BIP-148 has two end conditions -- it either takes over the Legacy chain (by having more PoW) or ~~it flat-out vanishes at midnight November 15th 2017.~~
~~This does not have an open-ended trading value, and one of the two chains will **for sure be wiped out**.~~  I don't see this as a good thing for Bitcoin.
Nope, I was wrong -- both chains could, possibly persist with different transaction histories.
