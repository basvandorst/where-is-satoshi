# Parody - an *imitation* of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with *deliberate exaggeration for comic effect.*
OP's video is neither a imitation, nor is it *exaggerated* with or without comic effect. It's 99.9% their video and music with *ZERO* alteration until the last few seconds.

 is the process of converting or establishing something into legal tender.
No, his use of **PayPal's** video had **everything** to do with monetization. It's PayPal's intellectual property. They spent money on creating that video to convert their work, embodied as their service into legal tender that benefits the employees and share holders.
OP took that intellectual property, which he had **NO** right to usurp, and used it for his own gain. He did *NOT* have to necessarily earn money directly from it. By posting it to face book, he did the **EXACT** same thing PatPad did by running it during the Super Bowl. He captured people's attention, possibly getting subscribers. YouTube allows video producers to monetize their videos. Even if he didn't, additional subscribers are still seems as gains. Those gains were the result of OP stealing another companies ad.

Yes it's for one phone, but it's **NOT** a "back door". The FBI is trying to keep the phone from bricking itself after too many failed PIN code attempts. They want to brute force the PIN, which would unlock it, giving them everything they need. Apple says it can't be done, which is by design.

No they're not. In most cases, taxes are deducted from income at the time it's earned. I defy you to explain how extracting a simple percentage from an number in the column of a spreadsheet equates to 'force'. Secondly, you have a ***CHOICE*** whether to work or not. If you're so vehemently opposed to participating in a civil society, you could always choose not to. Just don't expect the same level of comfort you're used to.
Tens of thousands of soon to be Americans fought and died for the right of self governance. They, and those that came after them realized the need require a portion of commerce be taxed and used to fund the operation of the government they so bravely fought and died for to create. 'We the People' collectively decided this was, and still is, necessary.
If this arrangement doesn't work for you, then don't participate in it. You're welcome to live in a shack in the desert or under a bridge.

Also agreed, but with so many competitors, all are rendered practically useless. The internet flourished because of standardization of the underlying protocol. Until we get our act together and either a) standardize, or b) operate multiple protocols and bridge between them, we're right where we were when this sub was started.


I think that's a fatal mistake. Commercial infrastructure can't be trusted from an availability standpoint. With the stroke of a pen, all internet access, and the protocols like CJDNS that currently rely on commercial internet are completely vulnerable.


If you read the history of this sub, it was created to find an alternative to commercial networks. Unfortunately it's been co-opted by privacy freaks more concerned about being watched, than maintaining the ability to communicate in the face of mass outage.


I've tried many options, but none have been satisfactory. The one I continue to use is Serval. Every mesh netter should be running it. Commotion has the right idea, but I have issues with it's implementation. Serval and Commotion are a few minor configuration changes away from being compatible. Serval's mesh extender looks promising, and could easily be integrated with many of the other competing projects.

The value of a dollar has the potential to fluctuate just the same. The difference is Dollars are *everywhere* and the market is *MASSIVE*. It's much harder to move it's value one way or another.
