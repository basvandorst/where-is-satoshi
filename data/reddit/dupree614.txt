“Money as a system of control.”

Most people as in 6.5 billion people don’t really get how currency works or if they do they are criminally under banked. Stop focusing on the currency application of block chain tech and instead think of it instead as a technology that’s potential to change this modern world is so valuable it’ll never go away nor be regulated... that is unless they really start policing the internet. The only way this movement stops or dies out is if the internet stops or dies out. This invention is here to stay so either get on board now and benefit or later and not so much(outside of the benefit of being within that system). Regardless this thing is here to stay no matter your skepticism.

Do they really know how our current financial system   (Currency, economy, banking) even works? Do they even get how the Dollar works or what it’s backed by? In the last 3 weeks I’ve taught myself about block chain tech and crypto currencies as well as filled in a lot of blank spots to better educate myself on our current system &amp; I’d have to say I’m leaning more towards the new one rather than the old. Understanding the simple elegance of this new tech will truly give you and understanding of the radical implications of what applying this new tech to our everyday lives truly means. Don’t get involved as an investment or to day trade and attempt to get rich quick rather get involved because you see how rigged and corrupt our current system is and you believe in what this new tech can do to change all of that for the better. 
Edit: I didn’t get involved to make money but instead to change the way things are done now with our currents systems. As I see it there’s only one thing this tech will guarantee and that is the power changes hand from big banks to back to the people (banks don’t really want this change as they get 70 billion a month in welfare why adopt this new thing when all it’ll do is disrupt that easy paycheck) and instead will revolutionize everything from how we spend or make or store money to the types of contracts we make all without having lawyers get involved. I could go on about why I believe in this so much but I’m not trying to sell anyone on this idea. It seems most who are skeptical are only that way because they’ve allowed themselves to believe in a corrupted and broken system. Change is scary. I get it. You don’t want to accept things are changing and happening in a way that is so abrupt people are freaking out. IMO that’s a good thing, people need their cages rattled a bit to maybe wake them up and see what’s really going on.  I welcome your downvotes albeit I don’t get it but hey it validates my beliefs more than a bunch of people jumping on board simply for not being critical thinkers.

I have always wanted to start a non profit with the goal of getting life water straws to people in 2nd and third world nations as getting clean water is one of this planets biggest problems. I’m even taking a course on non profits this semester to help me better understand how to start and run such an organization. My goal isn’t money for me but money to buy this product and send it to the right people. If I can get this idea some legs to walk on would I be able to apply to the pineapple fund to help get me started. Part of why I’m becoming involved in the crypto community is to be able to become a philanthropist. I truly respect and admire what your doing with your coin, you are a true inspiration!

Are you a PhD economist?  Do you have it figured out? Did I say I had all the answers? What does any of that have to do with the price of beans? A lot of conjecture in here. I feel like you just regurgitated info you haven’t even validated yourself in order to undermine the actual point I am am attempting to make.

The people most scared about this are western consumers who are worried they won’t be able to get their next Prada bag. Big time people in the world of finance aren’t having those woes instead their plugging into the machine. It’s here to stay folks. Just as people didn’t want or believe in the internet 25+ years ago. People are doing the same with this new tech and all of its endless applications. Let me tell you if no one has broken the news it’s here to stay just like the internet. As op said arm yourselves with knowledge.
