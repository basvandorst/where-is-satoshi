cant win if you dont play!...but with that being said and beyond anyones circumstances, play smart, look long(er) term, and dont bet the house...the only true losses come from cashing out.

Nah man. This dude was extremely negative and wasn’t make much sense. He was expecting a quicker return, but idk i think as long as you’re in the game and becoming familiar then that’s cool. As for the money loss... if you’re holding then you are not out. Still have a ton of opportunity. But for real he needs more blankets and less blankets’

EVERYONE!!! check your accounts again! I order a new card once I noticed that fraudulent charges about two weeks ago  and got my new card and there are already some more fraud charges? Something is going on so make sure to get your funds off your bitpay card for the time being

You're making a lot of sense, but tbh I am more worried about the TAX and IRS part of it. In the states, If I trade/cash out within the same year, I am obligated to pay a tax of 50% of my profits? and can only write off $3k as a loss. So the FOMO aspect of the idea blows. it strong arms most into HODL.

Best advice would be to learn about btc and DCA until the [btc halving event ](
@_date: 2019-09-13 16:45:24
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:14:47
The momentum is on btc side with Bakkt and the upcoming [halving event]( . I’d recommend to express that you’re DCA’ing appropriately and that the wind is in your favor....but don’t ever forget it is a speculative asset and with that being said it is the least riskiest cryptocurrency when it comes to investing ...for the mean time!

[btcpayserver.org]( is perfect for freelancers. It does not require kyc and accepts btc and alts, but unfortunately does not convert to fiat. But I’m sure as you get more familiar, this may be the best for a freelancer since is a code and not a company, no reporting will take place.

@_date: 2019-09-14 13:56:45
Unfortunately not rn, but they are working on it. [btcpayserver.org]( is a code and not a company that does not require kyc , so I understand the difficulty for company’s or anyone accepting crypto for payments and need to convert to fiat, but this is the idea of being decentralized ... baby steps! ... so if it doesn’t fit your current needs, i recommend to follow and stay up to date.
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:09:23
Like any other asset... have a plan man! ...especially if that’s money for loved ones’

[btcpayserver.org]( 
No third party or kyc bc it is code and not a company ... also accept alts!
@_date: 2019-09-11 10:15:20
I think the true problem is 1% has all the money, so it’s very difficult for the mass to invest in a speculative asset
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:51:29
Tbh I need to really know what bakkt is... I thought it was mainly for institutional money .... I guess I might try bakkt just to be familiar with their process and volume if I only need to have $3900 to play with... but mainly to understand bakkt and see if this will really help adoption.

What we talking about bro? I’m just trying to migrate away from other centralized merchant processors. I love the fact that btcpayserver doesn’t require kyc and I do not mind taking the extra steps for that exact idea, but it would be nice to have a fiat option.

Well...in theory we see it as a possibility for a transfer of wealth.... with that being said we should acknowledge that a majority of millennials can not afford to save or invest... and especially in a speculative asset... I am not one of those millennials but my friends and family seem to express that very without hesitation.

First off, don’t share any info on your bags
Second off, you can’t go wrong with btc. The next major event to take place is the bitcoin halving event which should take place sometime next year around the end of the first quarter. I’d recommend to learn how to DCA your funds into btc so you can learn the market trends and gain confidence when it comes to trades, buy, sales etc but mainly I’d recommend to accumulate as much btc prior to
The btc halving event [btc halving clock ](
