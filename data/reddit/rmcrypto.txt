So many more stocks than cryptos out there though Sir Hodlington (great name��).

The old "Santa Claus rally". Possibly!

Very strange...

Digital gold is fine, while the wider crypto space/community continues to work on development/adoption of cryptocurrencies as medium of exchange.

Should probably sum the numbers for "stocks" and "shares"

Not sure why anyone would do that unless they're looking to cause a massive decline and create panic? I mean a short-term need for 180/190m USD? If someone wanted to cash out completely, it would seem better to stagger the selling over a period of days/weeks , maybe a 1,000 per day with even those being done in increments.

Correct me if i'm off but likely someone (or more) just chucked in a sizeable sell order, which is probably why you would see all these small buys be eaten up and be sat there wondering why the sell order u just threw in wasn't eaten up - orders queued.

Wow that gives an implied  EURUSD rate of 1.06, while the market rate is currently around 1.18.

I'd actually put myself in the boat of the following: if you can see that people will overreact, then there are trading opportunities to take advantage of i.e. sell if you have the conviction, then buy back once the dust settles. Again, the shortcomings of an exchange do not translate to shortcomings of BTC.

Sounds like $25 is something you're comfortable with, which is a good thing to know and something many people in this space don't want to come to terms with for themselves. As for cost of transaction, try to get a percentage fee quoted - 0.25% seems pretty standard at exchanges but then that's not the only medium through which to buy, and so can vary.

Well played. ��

It never is an issue with BTC, always the exchanges or other exterior factor that let everyone down. May be some unwarranted short-term vol, long term unchanged - depending of course on what ur LT view is.

Unless you've got a Coinbase account with which you'd already have done the same, pretty sure there's no way to skip.

Tricky business. What will Asia do, that's the golden question... When in doubt, HODL or sell everything :D

I’d recommend Bitstamp if you’re looking for relatively lower fees - 0.25%. I haven’t looked around too much although I see bl3p has the same fee. Regardless, you need to deposit funds to get started (SEPA transfer is cheapest) - once that’s done though, purchases are quick. If you use a limit order you can dictate the rate you want to receive but obviously there needs to be a seller willing to sell at that price. Coinbase charges 4% if you use a credit/debit card but the purchase is instant.
