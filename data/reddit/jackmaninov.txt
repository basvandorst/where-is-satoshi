The problem is that there is no incentive for "big investors" to participate in these leveraged markets and become market makers, which would smooth out these kinds of wild swings. If I were sitting on 100k BTC, why would I put it into BTC-E? The next day it would mysteriously get "hacked"...
So all you're left with is all these small-fry day traders that can be crushed by a 1k BTC whale.

Buy with credit card: failed. This is on an Erste Visa with TAC-SMS verification ("Secure Online Shopping"). It still doesn't work if I disable the SMS verification, but I didn't wait very long.
Sell with credit card: didn't try.
EDIT: Tried again today (Oct 7) and the purchase didn't immediately fail. Instead it is now "pending". No SMS notification to my phone, which I usually get within 1 minute of a credit card transaction.
EDIT2: Purchase by credit card __now working__, took about 17 minutes to clear.
EDIT3: The fee breakdown from my purchase. $10 USD cost 8.28 EUR. A 1.47% fee (0.12 EUR) was applied by my bank on top of the exchange rate (I'm not sure if there's a flat component to that). Circle added the 2.9% fee that everyone else is seeing.
    Order amount -10,29
    Amount -8,28 EUR
    inkl. Fremdwährungsentgelt 0,12
    Exchange rate: 1,2610294
Sell with credit card: Worked. I put my sell order at 5:08 pm and received an email notification the next day at 8:25pm. I'll add the fee breakdown once the refund is posted to my account.
EDIT4: Sell with credit card was posted to my account the next day, and I received 7.47 EUR back:
    Order amount 9,70 USD
    Amount 7,47 EUR
    inkl. Fremdwährungsentgelt 0,11
    Exchange rate: 1,2796833

Ok, your previous comment was worded a bit unclearly (converting "between BTC and the western banking system" doesn't necessarily imply which direction the conversion happens in). especially in the context of GP talking about moving the market when *buying* BTC.
I agree that there are lots of options for selling BTC in the western banking system. But OP's problem is getting money out of the sanctioned country, which is limited by the liquidity of BTC-e and localbitcoins (and you would expect others to begin exploring these routes as well...)
EDIT: and GP is unclear when he talks about buying BTC then talks about the liquidity of selling it for CAD in the same sentence, hence the confusion...

Flash-crashes like BTC-e are learning opportunities for the market. If people now want to migrate from BTC-e to Bitfinex because they want circuit breakers, they can. If smart people don't want circuit breakers because their trading strategy doesn't require them, they are free to stay with BTC-e. The relative market share between the two will give us some idea of how much demand there is for them. Simple!
Unfortunately for some, revealing this information to the marketplace cost some money.

Bitstamp's Slovenian bank is in the Eurozone, and should suffer from the same geopolitical problems or sanction related transfer issues as any of the other big exchanges (as talked about in the post). Slovenia isn't really a big enough country to stick it to Brussels and ignore sanction directives.
The possible exception would be the Chinese exchanges, if OP can get an account there and the RUB to USD (or RMB) conversion isn't too bad. I haven't really been following the status of their support for foreign traders.

If the late 90's/early 00's were any indication, I predict a multi-year standards war over new digital currency techs. Remember the instant messenger wars (which never really ended) and putting 5 different IM contacts on your business card or website profile? It will be like that, except marketers will expect us to keep a balance of 5 different value tokens. And everyone will hate it.
To me the only question is what form the consumer revolt will be: people getting turned off digital payments entirely, or a quick adoption of an open standard like Bitcoin.

Try taking cash out of an ATM from your credit card. This is where I've seen this fee in the past. Basically, there's no "merchant" to pass along the credit card's fee when you're taking cash (it's not like the ATM operators are selling you cash at a markup from "wholesale"), so you get charged a fee directly yourself. 
Plus, your bank can start charging you interest on the amount immediately.

Thought experiment: if one wanted to run something like a Bitcoin Central Bank, you could gather a nice pile of Bitcoins and publicly commit to sitting on them until they are "needed" to inflate some asset bubble. Why this makes sense to OP is beyond me, but you could do it with sufficient resources.
The hypothetical Central Bank could even use nLockTime transactions to guarantee its coins are held out of circulation. It could then set up whatever "minting" aka unlocking schedule that it wanted. But it could never create new currency units, it would have to earn them just like everyone else.
Plus, anyone could do this, so there can be competition between Central Banks of sorts. Probably the whole idea would be unprofitable, and the idea would die out, but die-hards have the opportunity to try!

The mining bonds are less risky in that they rely on a public business model with a (normally) positive rate of return, but they're denominated in hash rate rather than BTC. They are *priced* in BTC, but one shouldn't expect that value to be redeemable in the future, since the cost of hardware associated with a certain hash rate goes down over time as computers improve. This makes a mining bond more like purchasing a BTC annuity with some return you will realize in the future rather than a deposit.
The lending bonds do usually have a buyback value similar to their purchase or initial offer price, but require risk to be assumed on the part of the bondholder. The lender may encounter defaults or pirateat40's arbitrage business model may fail, in which case future interest and principal may be lost. 
That said, depending on the size of your investment there are insurance contracts that can be purchased that may bring a lending bond more in line with the risk you would expect from a traditional certificate of deposit. And we may be assuming that deposits in the traditional financial system are less risky than they actually are...

Who would you go after? 
Gigamining is issued by 'gigavps', an account on a forum (with a great web-of-trust rating, don't get me wrong, this isn't a bash against gigavps). So I suppose you'd have to get a court to compel GLBSE to release information about gigavps's accounts in the hopes of tracking him or her down. How do you know he or she is in a jurisdiction that would honour the bond contract as you understand it, instead of just tossing the case?
Even if the court system of whatever country would uphold the contract as you understand it, that judgement would have never happened before and could have any number of new precedents attached to it. This is itself a form of risk. And you would have legal expenses reaching such a verdict, another form of risk.
The Bitcoin economy is risk all the way down. The only thing counteracting this is the belief by the market participants that they can create value for themselves by collaborating.

This is actually a great use case for Bitcoin. Here's what I recommend if you're concerned about being safe and dealing with major exchanges:
1. Trade EUR for BTC on Bitstamp. You can also sometimes get a better price on Bitcoin.de, but the volume is much lower. Fees are pretty low on Bitstamp (0.5% and lower as your volume increases, see 
2. Transfer BTC to Virtex (cavirtex.com) and sell for CAD. Fees on Virtex are sadly quite a bit higher, but you should be able to get them down by moving up the volume scale (
3. Withdraw from Virtex to your Canadian account.
I've basically done the opposite when I moved from Canada to Europe. 
While you may not save money in fees, you will be paying them to members of the Bitcoin community rather than the big banks. Also, Bitcoin supply tends to be a bit higher in Canada than Europe, so the exchange rate can sometimes be quite a bit better (I've seen a 3 cent better price on CADEUR exchange, though it's only about 0.7 cents better today).
Once you're a bit more comfortable using Bitcoin for keeping yourself alive, you may wish to find someone local in Canada that can give you a better price on exchanging than Virtex.
EDIT: a bit of a caveat: Virtex doesn't support 2 factor authentication (STILL!). Don't store BTC there.

This. As another silver lining, Pirate seems to have been able to get some people to release their hoarded Bitcoin into the market. It's inevitable that some people who invest their Bitcoin will lose it, but the exchange rate to the fiat currencies will increase. This is inescapable; we can't all horde and there are only a relatively small number of new coins being minted, therefore some people will have to experience BTC losses in order to bring new people into the BTC economy. 
As long as you didn't invest all or a majority of your coins in Pirate you're probably ahead!

Responding on my phone so this might be a bit poorly formatted:
* Knowing the cost of living in Canada, I would assume OP would be in Virtex's 2.5% fee bracket within 3 months, so he/she would be paying the same or lower fees than his/her existing 3%. 
* If OP found someone to exchange the coins with locally that he/she could trust he/she would save on fees and wouldn't have to trust an exchange not to implode (which seems unlikely to me for Virtex and there are more options in the EUR market). 
* What is prudent is a matter of personal opinion. I would suggest that this method of funding an education isn't very prudent in the first place if the living allowance on the EUR side is fixed. An economic event in the Eurozone (someone going bankrupt or withdrawing from the Euro) could potentially change the CADEUR exchange rate drastically overnight, as the CAD is largely backed by oil and the mining industry. OP should already be worrying about currency volatility. 
* Convenience is worth something when you're a busy student. The transfer I suggested can be done 24 hours a day from OP's computer. 
* Ideology is worth something too. If you can fund Bitcoin businesses rather than international banks that are invested in all the  things that are wrong in the economy today then maybe you can sleep a bit better at night. 
That said I admit there are likely better ways out there to do this (the xe.com suggestion was good), but OP asked about our thoughts on how to do this with Bitcoin. I stand by international remittance and transfers being a good use case for Bitcoin at the present time, it's just a shame that Virtex's fees are so high (they were much lower last year).

Roughly speaking, to perform a 51% attack against the current Bitcoin network, you would need to spend 2% more than the cost of the existing install base of hardware assuming it was all bought now. A lot of the install base is lower performing hardware that is less capable in MHash/$, and there's nowhere close to $16 billion currently invested, so no.

If you bought 1 bond of Gigamining right now for 1.25BTC, you're buying the output of 5 MH/s of mining equipment, which today seems to be worth 1.25BTC and this past week paid a coupon of 0.02225. So you're buying a bond denominated in mining equipment.
As mining difficulty increases, ASIC mining hardware get released, more people mine, etc, etc, the weekly output of 5 MH/s of mining equipment will decrease, and as a result the bond goes down in value. So if you are looking for y% return for z months, you are not guaranteed to get your x BTC back (in fact you are basically guaranteed NOT to get it back if difficulty increases). You can look back over the dividend history of Gigamining to watch how the coupon has played out historically. It has gone up as well as down in the past, and it looks like the maximum it has paid is 0.02333569.
There are some complications going on at the moment with some mining bonds offering one-time upgrades of the mining power associated with a bond, but there is nothing in the contract of these bonds requiring the operators to do this. So if you're making a long-term investment you should consider mining bond face value to asymptotically decay to zero over time.
Of course my entire analysis above is premised on BTC continuing to appreciate in value over time and mining difficulty continuing to increase. If Bitcoin completely crashed in value, who knows, Gigamining could become the only mining operation left in existence and its bondholders entitled to all mining rewards. This would increase the BTC price of the bonds and their rate of return in BTC, but those BTC wouldn't be worth very much (and I question why Gigamining would continue to operate in the face of electricity costs payable in non-BTC currency).

I would counter that there was a lot of economy-wide growth occurring during the period of $4.5 - $5.5 stability that wasn't reflected in the exchange price, leading to pent up demand for BTC.

You can invest your BTC in bonds through GLBSE (some even with specific periods of time), however these are widely seen as very risky assets and pay very high rates of interest in return (1-7% weekly). So I wouldn't go so far as to call them certificates of deposit (which implies a low risk investment).

And while you or I may be comfortable arranging Bitcoin trades as one time meets over the internet in this way, I don't think the masses will be too quick to come on board if an online transaction is the only way to buy into the Bitcoin economy.
Foot traffic at a fixed location would establish physical presence, rapport and trust for an exchange in a way that a website cannot. I'm sure there are lots of people that would want to chat with someone in person, maybe several times before finally committing to the transaction. Somewhere to go for in person tech support of wallet issues, or to try a bitcoin client on their phone, etc, etc.
There's a reason why retail hasn't been completely destroyed by the internet yet. 
I think the guys working on Bitcoin ATMs are on to something. If you could have one of these at an open air market beside someone explaining Bitcoin and answering questions then that would be a good path for adoption. Just explain it as something that can work as a semi-local currency and you'd suddenly have lots of adopters.

This thread isn't really about free stock tips, so I'll give you real advise:
1. Research, research, research. People entering the market right now are lucky in that they can invest in established operations where the operator has a track record, but in return they lose out on some IPO exuberance. Go check out the [securities forum on bitcointalk]( and look at the business models (or lack thereof). 
2. Define your investment horizon. Obviously you don't want to lose your 50 BTC, but do you foresee needing it back in 6 months? 1 year? 1 week? This should help you decide on your appetite for risk vs return.
3. Make your own decisions. Anyone that tells you that they *know*  how the Bitcoin economy is going to behave in the future is making predictions based on an imperfect model in their head. This is true in the traditional market as well, but the Bitcoin market is far more "wild west". Many actors are anonymous. Contracts are not really binding, or terms may change day to day. Disruptive innovation is occurring (like the mining bond upgrades I mentioned above). About the only "constant" is that 50 BTC gets printed every 10 minutes (though soon even that changes to 25!)
4. Diversify. You are going to make poor decisions as well as good ones, so don't go investing all your money in one GLBSE issue that sounds amazing. This also means you should hold a BTC reserve (or fiat on an exchange that can quickly be converted to BTC). The best deal may not be available today, and new IPOs are happening all the time.

I can see two routes you could go on this:
1) A typical encrypted, multi-connection binary download provider with transfer blocks paid in Bitcoin. Maybe some incentive to park some Bitcoins in your wallet and use it as a declining balance. I think people would expect a discount over other Usenet providers that suffer from payment processor fees and chargebacks.
2) Some sort of hyper-paranoid Usenet service, like running your payment interface through a Tor hidden service and providing international proxies through servers identified only by IPs, throwaway domains or Namecoin domains. 
I personally wouldn't be looking for the hyper-paranoid option, though I might use payment through a hidden service if that were an option (and would be cheap to implement).
Hope to hear more soon.

Nowhere near 43 BTC a day, your friend is definitely screwing something up..
My card doing 200 MHash/s averages 0.06 - 0.09 BTC a day. Your card would do under a tenth of that. The best cards out there (ATI 5970's or 6990's) can do over 800 MHash/s overclocked, so that would be a maximum of ~0.5 BTC a day.
I would not suggest mining with your card. Mobile GPUs are horrible at mining, and Nvidia chips are also bad. Both together is extra bad.

I'm confused about the criticism of RTpay. If we want to structure our governments' tax system to be a VAT on each transaction, then having this done in real time seems to be the best way to do this. If privacy is a concern, regulate privacy-leaking data fields out of the transaction message out of the protocol (which I suppose would be difficult in the specific case of Bitcoin since you can always trace payment back to the previous senders' address).
But if privacy is deemed more important than the VAT, get rid of the VAT. Blaming a company providing solutions for VAT collection doesn't seem very productive.

When someone with the skill set and CV to write robust, secure code to implement some of these digital property ideas can pitch a good business case, the investors will come. 
However, what you're talking about sounds more like R&amp;D, which is much more difficult to fund in a market because of the high degree of uncertainty. I think the Bitcoin community should be focusing more effort to solicit research grants and find interested members of academia. This is (sadly) how this kind of development is funded these days, with the wider stock market chasing speculative assets that are not much better than HYIPs (IMHO).
Part of the problem is that Bitcoins are still worth too little to attract serious investment of both time and money. Because of this, you could almost consider the HYIP drama to be *good* for the kinds of projects you're talking about, as even bad press for Bitcoin is better than no press.

I don't doubt that gigamining is legit, but to play devil's advocate, GLBSE can't really validate that the photo ID that they're being shown is authentic, only that it corroborates other forms of verification. 
Maybe in the future there will be some sort of legally binding process to further validate an asset issuer, but some issuers are interested in anonymity and some issuers make a point of advertise their identity in the hopes of gaining trust.
Maybe that sort of risk wouldn't keep you from investing in gigaminig (and it hasn't kept me from investing in assets that hold gigamining), but it would keep a pension fund from investing, for example. In return you're offered a very attractive rate of return compared to traditional investments!

I think pirate is trying to streamline his organization so that he has less lender interaction and less work to do. It makes for far less work for him if he completely outsources all the client management to the various entities that are running passthrough operations. Now he can focus on a smaller number of clients, and he can individually negotiate rate of return with the big ones. To me it seems like he's taking steps suggested in the 4-Hour Workweek in order to reduce his time spent operating BS&amp;T while improving his own return.
My guess is that the only reason he retains traditional accounts at all is for the paranoid types who don't want to trust an intermediary, only pirate, with their BTC. In return for taking up pirate's time they get a lower rate of return, however.
It could be assumed that by making it easier for 3rd parties to interact with small investors he is trying to draw in more capital, but there's no public evidence that significant funds are being withdrawn from BS&amp;T (for example, you would expect supply of pass through shares on GLBSE to outstrip demand and prices to drop).
I suspect the opposite of the Ponzi crash scenario: that he's reaching the limit of how large his operation can grow before compromising its business model.

Not necessarily. One use of dark pools is to trade large volumes without instantaneously moving the public market, which you would typically pay a premium to do. 
If I had $10mm that I wanted to move into Bitcoin and I started buying on Mt.Gox, the sellers in the market would notice and the price would skyrocket (we see this all the time on a smaller scale). Through a dark pool I could potentially buy at a premium over the market rate and get a better price on the overall order execution, provided the pool has enough liquidity (which would require a large BTC reserve). 
Pirate seems to have based his scam around this idea.

We only have one data-point about the trust accounts right now: that their interest rate starts at 5%. We'll start to get more info as the various pass-throughs update their terms, but I wouldn't assume that many people are going to get 7% anymore. This should slow his operation's growth rate considerably, as now other ventures that are much more open to analysis can compete better. 
Also I don't expect making it "easier" for people to make accounts will counteract this, as I don't think anyone that wanted exposure to pirate was having hard time getting it through a pass-through (for example PPT.x was raising fewer funds due to the explosion of other GLBSE pass throughs).
Even if the large Trust accounts still pull 7% I think the desire to automate his business is enough to explain the changes (we know he's been working on his website in the last little while, for example).

I don't know how I would break on the right/left spectrum, but I'm a Green party member from Canada who strongly believes in a safety net/mincome social welfare model funded by a progressive income tax and pollution taxes. This model should be based on a voluntary social contract: to live "in" our community you must pay in, and if you do not wish to live "in" our community you are free to leave, no hard feelings. In Canada this has sort of always been possible because people have been quite free to move to the USA if they feel our system is to repressive or redistributive or whatever. Though personally I've never felt attached to concepts of home or "my land" because I've moved around so much my whole life, so I can understand why people wouldn't accept this concept of "like it or leave".
I like Bitcoin because it (at the moment) allows money to be decoupled from this political question. Money has become one of our most basic social interactions and I don't think it is appropriate that this be intermediated by the state, in the same way that I don't think the state should be telling you what time to wake up in the morning or what your favourite colour should be.

In the short to medium term, the vast majority of coins will be in the hands of those who already have them (almost 9.5 million). Plus the block reward is about to halve.
I'm concerned that the mining power being concentrated in few hands will leave the blockchain open to corruption. I'm not very concerned that fewer people will be getting the relatively small number of new coins (especially since this may cause the value of the coins to increase).

Ca Virtex usually manages to avoid a lot of the MT Gox mania because of its low trading limits, so it's usually safer to buy on it. The price is usually below the the MT Gox price (even with the exchange rate taken into considerations) so you can get a good deal. I think the Canadian Bitcoin miners prefer to take a lower price for the convenience of using a local exchange.
But gox is right, no one really can answer this question for you.

FIX is a bastard of a trading protocol; basically the simplest, least structured way to possibly link up poorly designed trading engines to each other. Somehow it survives in industry with no well designed standards to compete with it, so I would hope that the open source community could redesign or heavily refine the standard in building a new protocol.
That said, FIX does permit the relevent information for the majority of existing financial transactions types to be transmitted, so as long as we're going to implement "real" financial trades it would be a useful protocol to offer. There is a lot of FIX compatible trading software out there that could be hooked into FIX compliant exchanges.

I'm confused. So you're against pools because you're pro solo mining, or do you want some sort of centralized pool?
Pools are pretty much the only option for small miners at this stage as the difficulty will (likely) continue to rise so quickly as to ensure only pools/large solo miners can ever statistically find coins.

I think FIX adoption would actually solve the initial problem of inter-exchange liquidity, as existing players would be able to hook in their algos and auto exchange routers to hit liquidity across the multiple independent exchanges. 
Exchanges could compete on trade fees and run of the mill users could do their currency exchange with broker-dealers who would charge fees in return for actual security and best-execution guarantees, unlike what we have now.

The problem is that the straight-up FIX spec isn't good for streaming market data (there's a FAST protocol designed with that more in mind but it isn't widely implemented to my knowledge). FIX was originally designed to deliver trading instructions from buy side to sell side and then get execution reports on the progress of that trade.

I think there's still a lot of profit taking going on driven by the early adopters (those with thousands of coins to their names). They can still get a lot of people to buy their coins in the $6 - $10 range and it will be a while before they've unloaded enough coins that they no longer "feel rich". Or maybe they're trying to pay off their student loans, who knows.
That said, I think there will be a month or two of instability as the wealth of the BTC rich diffuses into the growing community. I don't really think BTC will hit critical mass until there's a large body of NFC smartphones out there that can run a stripped-down wallet, plus some sort of gateway service that can push transactions or new blocks so that iOS devices can run the software.

One needs a certain amount of oil to fuel a car, and a certain amount of wheat to provide nutrition. Bitcoin demand is instead a function of speculation and money velocity in the bitcoin economy. Commodities also have storage/spoilage costs.

@_date: 2011-06-05 21:25:35

@_date: 2015-10-07 17:43:15
My point is more that most users do not need 1 BTC to do anything that couldn't also be done with 0.1 BTC that is worth ten times more according to some external valuation, so supply and demand will not work the same as with a commodity that has a certain amount of utility per unit. The exception to this is when talking about small amounts near the Tx fee, so high Tx volume users will feel a different supply effect than high value users.

Really good analysis. I would argue that Bitcoin being an information technology that requires capital investment to use is an incentive rather than a disincentive to its adoption.
The validation of precious metals also requires capital investment to perform (we're well beyond the point of biting gold to verify its composition, and accurate weigh scales are not free) which has little additional utility beyond this use. Information technology equipment already has thousands of compelling uses driving their adoption pre-Bitcoin among all social classes (look at cell phone adoption in Africa for example). Adding the medium of exchange to your smartphone simply adds one more killer app to drive adoption. 
The gold bugs also have no answer to Bitcoin's decentralized electronic transmission method. No, I do not trust gold ETFs to retain their value in the same way Bitcoins during transactions

I agree that NYC is safe, but I'd hope that this exchange would plan on taking some precautions if it wants to grow at all. You're not exactly the same sort of target as a random New Yorker walking around with cash in his/her pocket,  you're basically an open-air cash business. Armoured cars don't get robbed that often either, but it's because they have a security system in place that dissuades people from robbing them.
Maybe no single person shows up with $50k in cash, but a market maker might need access to $50k over the course of a day if dealing with a large volume of small orders, especially since this type of venue seems like it would cater to Joe Public showing up and dropping $20 for some introductory coins. Maybe a system for cash drops or a nearby safe with timer would be a service the exchange could provide to get some revenue.

Yes, I've read the article, and the issue is that this new data sharing agreement will prevent some Americans living in Canada from complying with some sillier parts of US tax law, ie income tax on foreign income, filling taxes without having US income, etc.
There are plenty of Americans living normal lives in Canada for a variety of reasons and that don't want to change their citizenship. Hell, you didn't even need a passport to cross the border in either direction before 9/11, we were happy to have these people. They just want to live their life in peace without being messed with by government, but now they're being treated like they're stashing their wealth in the Cayman Islands or something.
Probably the solution should be to reform the insanity that is US tax law, but why do that when the US can lean on the rest of the developed world to comply with crazy reporting requirements instead...

It ticked on bitcoinity too (that's how I noticed it). So a trade message must have been broadcasted to both data services (unless bitcoinity reads off bitcoincharts).
EDIT: also the tick up to $86 a few minutes later looked suspicious in the same way, but it DOES show up in the daily range.

My guess is that the banks don't want clients that cause the number of teller transactions that Virtex and the like incur. At some point some beancounter notices that it's unprofitable, and bamn, dropped.
To me it raises the question whether banks should be considered a utility that cannot refuse some level service. Especially since they suckle at the teat of government with monopoly access to central banks and things like this.

Trading of colored coins will be limited by block sizes, meaning the decentralized exchange idea will likely not go very far. Blockchain size scaling will already be an issue with just the Bitcoin transaction base plus Satoshidice et al, let alone the transaction history of every security people want to trade.
Maybe colored coins could be used for exchange settlement, but I'm more excited to see where Open-Transactions goes in the future.
