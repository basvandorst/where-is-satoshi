Hey OP,
If I can share some feedback. I day trade bitcoins in Canada and use cryptowat.ch as a candlestick chart and Bitcoin checker to monitor pricing when away from my desk. 
It works good for monitoring profits on hodlers but having some charts alerts from multiple exchanges would be nice.
A feature I haven't found (and I don't know if it technically possible) is an overlay chart of the top 5 biggest exchanges to track the movement and not nessicarily the price. I would pay for this feature probably 10 bucks if I could use it on a webpage and the app. 
Ui looks pretty and is useable. Keep it up!

My thought 2. New bottom at 11.3

When average Joe's are giving stock tips it's a good sign the market is over valued. Joe Kennedy famously exited the market just before the 1930 stock market crash when a shoe shine boy told him stock tips.

The amount of bitcoin you buy will be the same. It doesn't change. It will be worth whatever others are willing to pay for it.

@_date: 2018-02-22 15:33:42
Its ALL fundamentals and human psychology. Fear and greed are multiplied by 100 vs the stock market. 
Very few people here at least from what I see day trade any stocks or bonds. They swing 1-2% a day TOPS usually it's 0%. Crashes or a falling stock can takes years to recover. 
This is why BITCOIN is the funnest asset in the world to trade!!!!!! Follow the smart money and profits are nearly gaurentees.
