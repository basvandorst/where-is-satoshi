Depends on what happens in the next few years. Have the masses adopted it? How is it being used? Etc. The current plan is to DCA to own at least 1.1 BTC and hodl until 0.1 equals my initial investment which I'll pull out so the rest will be pure growth. At that point it'll depend on how many people have adopted the technology and whether it makes a better payment method or only a store value. If the latter, I'll use it as a source of passive income and take out 25% of whatever gains it makes month to month up to a certain amount of living expense. Then pay my taxes as usual.

Compared to an offline wallet? Yep.
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:21:05
Done and done. I buy a little bit every day!

Now here is a prediction I can believe in!

@_date: 2019-07-08 19:48:09
To be honest, that is almost me, but I'm located a bit too far away and I'm currently in the process of hodling and not spending my BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:31:53

I have to say that I love the daily threads for the over-the-top moments. From the "to the moon" predictions to the "bitcoin is a pyramid scheme" lunacy provides some entertaining reading. Sometimes there are real gems in the rough and I learn something new, too.
But every day, at the same time, I just buy a little bit more. Makes no difference to a hodler!
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:56:55
If you're worried, you put in too much. If you're disappointed, you put in the right amount! (I'm in the same boat, nearing that red line)
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:16:35
DCA and Hodl seems to be the strategies many people (including me) are using but just curious if anyone has an endgame in mind? Do any of you have a goal or just hodling forever?

@_date: 2019-07-04 18:26:33
It's way easier to hack. There's also the possibility of them closing down and just taking your BTC although Coinbase is one of the more reputable exchanges.
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:46:05
Just hit dump o'clock.

But higher lows every year which I think is a more important number.

Even better news, I have a dual citizenship there!

To be fair, they weren't wrong... they just assumed it would only be them.
@_date: 2019-10-03 13:38:36
Nothing. There's a Canadian app called Shakepay that charges no fees. If you're wondering how they make money, it's on the spread.

Bought my daily DCA. Really sad I can't responsibly buy more every day =(
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:13:53
Buy: everyday
Sell: never sell all of it and it depends on what the payment systems of the future are like

Surprisingly, I love sailing recreationally so he's not far off!
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:46:52
I'm sitting here wondering if I should take $4k out of some stocks and buy more right now... my stocks can take that kind of hit but it would hurt. I want to be part of the 21 million club, though, and I'm FOMOing that this is the last chance to buy a decent chunk.

Oh, oh, living on a prayer...
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:44:05
Trying xcarter50cal's 0.001 BTC per day this month. I FOMOed yesterday and want to even out those emotions.
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:57:12
LOL! Yeah, basically, fees. But the same fee whether I buy all at once or spread it over the month to maximize DCA. I like buying every day  so I don't feel like I missed a dip.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:08:58

Hello Mr. Mcafee
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:29:29
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:24:31
I'm planning on something like reverse DCA if Bitcoin remains a store value. Sell 25% of the profit from month to month.
Say if 1BTC is $300,000 and rises 5% the next month to $315k, I'll cash out $3,750 leaving me with $311,250. Drops the next month by 5% to $295,680, don't sell. Increases 5% the following month to $310,470, sell $3,700.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:49:48
Please panic dip to $5k until next paycheque and jump to $15k right after...
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:30:38
Shakepay has no fees, otherwise I wouldn't have tried this either.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:11:46
I'll be honest, if I were him I wouldn't. Too many people hanging on every word I say, I'd be extremely hesitant to say anything like "maaaaybe, there is an off chance this thing could go to the moon."
Headlines the next day: "Buffett says to sell your house and buy bitcoin: 100% guaranteed to go to the moon!"
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:25:43
Out of curiosity, do you have a plan for when you can't afford .001 per day?
Edit: I may steal this idea for myself!
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:00:56
For those of you that follow it, the daily fear/greed index is almost through the roof at extreme greed. 
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:56:05
Exactly how I see it. I put money in and consider it GONE until it reaches a certain amount... so right now, I consider my investment to be worth $0.
@_date: 2019-10-05 14:05:41
I think they were learning from the Napster era. The technology is out there and it's business suicide to ignore its existence.
@_date: 2019-06-14 12:19:31
The moon. Or zero. More likely somewhere between those two.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:32:21
I think you meant Tracy Ullman
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:30:32
Planning on doing this too, the definition of "dead" has shifted because of technology. Odds are in your favor that you're absolutely right but I'll take non-zero odds, even if they are a decimal.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:38:02
Still early days, my friend.

Just a brief burning. Something quick within a small window.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:30:25
It still feels too good to be true to me but selling feels way too risky.

You can take a life insurance policy that will pay for it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:02:30
Buy 0.001 BTC each day, every day.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:01:07
I know a lot of people thing of LTC as silver to BTC gold, but I seem to use it to buy and move into and out of BTC. For me, it's more like personally backed fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:35:35
I did! Then it continued to dip...
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:41:44
AHAHAHA!!! I can write stuff like this too.
"Bitcoin hits 15 month high because campbell soup cans have sold out at the convenience store near my house."
@_date: 2019-06-14 12:25:59
Believe in it? Not sure that's the right word but I'm convinced enough about it to place some money where my mouth is.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:03:37

@_date: 2019-06-07 18:02:38

Um, that line of thinking can be applied to any form of investing.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:35:21
Cost averaging question here: I get paid once a month so I cost average buy all the BTC for that month as soon as I get my paycheck. Been wondering if it's better to do it that way or to save it and buy a bit every week instead? Or does it matter?

I was late making my daily DCA amount today so I have that going for me. Which is nice.
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:51:37
Same thing happened to me. Maybe it'll rise or maybe not. I'm more concerned about 5 years down the road.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:54:15
I'm freeeee... I'm free falling! And also hodling.
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:14:30
Here's what I do: I buy with the hope that it'll go much, much (much) higher but also the expectation it'll go to zero. As soon as I buy, I tell myself "that money is gone". Kind of like buying a decorative home piece. Maybe it'll be an antique and worth something or maybe no one will want it in 20 years. Only once it reaches an arbitrary fiat value I picked will it actually have any value to me. At that point, I may start withdrawing a little bit.
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:19:12

I'll be honest, most people have this reaction to fiat currencies and things like fractional reserve banking...
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:28:41
Buy regularly, as much as you can, and don't sell. Sounds boring but it's the simplest way.
Also, trade your XRP for BTC.
