This is 1 week too late for me! Was vacationing there 2 weeks ago. I knew COEX mall had one, but I assumed it was one way. I needed cash from bitcoin instead of the 3% foreign transaction fee from my credit card.

At least they are saving me from these losses by failing all my deposit attempts.

Im having the same issue. Ive contacted support as well.

When I bought my car I asked them to pay me monthly for their advertising. They took them all off for me ��

I don't think it is the act of receiving, but there is something that creates new addresses.  I've seen a few show up as well.
I heard somewhere that when you send BTC a very small amount comes back to you at a new address, I just chalked it up to this, but I did no further research.

I bought 5 BTC for $4.80 ($.96 each) to play with months ago, I made a purchase with 2  each  I feel quite satisfied right now.  (well, other than not buying more)

I totally would have directly paid in BTC if possible. BTC did allow me to make a purchase I otherwise wouldn't have.

Ha! what a waste of a comment! Should have said something interesting instead of looking like a douche.
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:16:20
I've got more BTC counting on Number 2.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:19:06
I'm sorry I bothered you so much with this. I understand your point. I just thought it was an interesting thing to see in my transaction log.
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:34:01
True, but 2 factors here.  One Im excited to support Bitcoin. Two, Im using coins I bought for &lt; $10 so I paid ~$12 including shipping in the end.

That's also what I'm thinking. Im thinking I have to develop something just to justify the device in my head.
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:50:59
Honestly I didn't. The invite has an expiration date, so I was anxious to get the order placed.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:15:03
This is actually how I usually do it.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:20:26
I'm sorry I don't. I'm really not sure how I ended up with one.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:22:47
Thanks! Ill do my best!
@_date: 2013-02-21 18:35:06
Yup, me to! Glad to be supporting the idea!
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:33:49
That's quite cool, Ill have to check it out when I get the device. Though its highly doubtful any places in my little town will have the tech. I know many shop owners, and maybe some of them will allow me to help them integrate.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:27:57
Thanks for the insight, I never would have thought this /sarcasm.
Please explain what I should have done instead. It was either don't buy, or transfer to fiat.
Now when people ask me about the device I have a great opportunity to talk about bitcoin too.
Edit: Your point was quite valid, just not so much in this case. I didn't mean to offend either.
