There haven't been that many situations of fascist countries trying this (not to mention that many fascist countries anyway), so there isn't that many situations to base it off on, but civic nationalism is hardly close to fascism and Trump, marrying off his daughters and sons to Jews, hardly seems like a person to be fascist.

Each time fascism has been tried, it either failed due to 1. military defeat by a military force much larger than their own (Croatian Ustase, Nazi Germany, Italy, etc.) or 2. incompetence by the fascists themselves (Iron Guard, Spain, etc). Fascism is not a 1984-tier government that serves to just cause pain and destruction. Most people can't even define fascism correctly.

As a fascist,  how is this administration fascist in any way? No racial segregation, no white nationalism, no racism, no fascist socialism. At worst Trump &amp; Pence are civic nationalists/paleocons 
personally I would love it if they were fascist or national socialist, but they are far far from it.

Cause I can make money off of bitcoin.

No but I can use it for rent, food, and most stores accept it. End goal is that bitcoin is used more than USD, and I can eat, pay rent, and all that stuff with bitcoin, but until then I will use USD.

Not a bad deal imo. I would rather have USD than Bitcoin, I can't use bitcoin to pay rent or buy food.

I've never read anything about a connection. No one is making an connection as far as i've seen.
