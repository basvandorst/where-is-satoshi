It's just trying to follow the white paper and be pure bitcoin as was intended.  BCC is the real Bitcoin now.  This reminds me of the UNIX wars.

Because all the media talks about is Bitcoin or Bitcoin like coins, or the term alt-coin. Bitcoin was here first, so it will always be mentioned first.  ETH is just now starting to be talked about in the media, but in every context Bitcoin is brought up wether or not the story needs it.

if your on Windows press Ctrl-Shift-D (I think) and bring up the menu, then you get Developer menu. Go, Developer &gt; Assets &gt; Bitcoin &gt; Export Private Keys.  They will be put in the exodus-exports folder on your desktop.  Open up CSV (with text editor) and get the priv key (it is behind the last / in the file) and when you have make sure that *Electron Cash* is syncronized and you are on the correct branch. See  and have it set the same.  Whenever you are synced to  and are up on the right blocklevel then send your BCC to your BCC wallet at exchange.  Or just keep it and enjoy it, add it into Blockfolio or something.

Use *Electron Cash* (fork of Electrum) to be on the correct chain, the program uses BCC as the abbreviation so, you can be sure.

You sweep the paper into a BTC wallet, and you sweep it again into a BCC/BCH wallet.
