I really hope people already knew that BTC at 20k was way overvalued at the time and didn't tell people to buy it.

Holy shit sorry. How did they break in? Hopefully you had cameras that caught the scum.

Yea man. Cash is king at the moment every investment you can think of is going to shit for the most part.

Lol! So what was I suppose to do? Invest $100,000 in bitcoin and lose it all? No thanks. I'm not that rich to throw away money like that

I mean it's obvious.. Pre-order that lambo, make it red. We going to the moon!

He's right.. Time to short my BTC..

My $900 from January is worthless. Should have gone to the strip club instead.
