The numbers are irrelevant, it’s the fact that I informed the bank ahead of time what I wanted to do with my money, and I still couldn’t do it. 
An anti-fraud system should protect the person who owns the account, not obstruct the person from using it. 
If I didn’t have someone to help me out, I would have been in trouble.
There are a lot of problems with Bitcoin, and it’s certainly not fool proof (yet). But it certainly has its use cases.

The fact that you’re in control of your money, and I mean ACTUALLY in control of it. 
I’ve recently completed several reasonably large transactions (for me) that I tried to do via my bank that left me out on a limb.
The first instance was a car purchase. I called my bank and informed them ahead of time how much I would be transferring, to whom and when. Attempted to transfer £xxxxx and only £xxxx went through. Tried to transfer the remainder and it was blocked. Called bank and they told me it was because of daily transfer limit. I told them I was now in a position where I had no car to get home (hundreds of miles away) and that a virtual stranger now had £xxxx of my money. It was such a pain in the arse, bank would do nothing even though I’d pre-warned them how I wanted to spend MY money. 
In the end I had to get my mum to transfer some more money to this guy so I could leave with the car. 
I’ve had several experiences like this in recent years. If I am not completely in control of my own money, then a bank does not work for me in some cases. I understand  protection layers are there for a reason, but they shouldn’t obstruct the owner! 
That would not happen with bitcoin.

So the vast majority of the population then? ��

Or just don’t talk to them about Bitcoin. Not everyone is on the same page, and some people you cannot convince. Pick your battles.

I was reading a book earlier, and saw the letter B.
Based on this, Bitcoin is going to 9k. Check your facts.

Sorry, my tired brain obviously didn’t read your question properly.

Bitcoin has a lot of traction and is continuing to gain more. 
Don’t take this the wrong way. If you’re looking for someone to validate or invalidate your potential investment then you need to ask yourself why you need that validation. 
Only you know for sure if it’s a good investment based on your personal circumstances. Whatever you decide, make sure you’ve done plenty of research and only invest what you can afford to lose. 
Don’t take strangers advice on investments, make an informed decision yourself. 
Hope that helped, apologies if it didn’t.

Thank you for the explanation, appreciated.

It is pretty handy. I stay away from potentially high impact events using the calendar and some other resources. Some like to trade them, but one of my personal rules is to avoid them, everyone is different though.

Forgive my lack of understanding, but is there any incentive to do so? Sadly not everyone is a Bitcoin evangelist or wants to see it succeed. 
I’d be happy to give it a try, but at the same time wouldn’t want to spend much of my money doing so and then have a continued overhead. 
Are there any advantages or benefits for the person setting up a node?

Universal currency
@_date: 2019-02-04 08:11:59
I try and use it for stuff I would buy normally anyway at places that accept Bitcoin. I’ll usually replace it again once I’ve spent a chunk of it. 
I used to just sit on it, but I figured for Bitcoin to ever work people need to use it more and more.
@_date: 2019-02-18 12:14:10
Tough one, depends on your personal circumstances I guess and how much you use BTC as an actual currency.
I wouldn’t be comfortable doing it, although the extra 15% is attractive. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:17:43
I try to use it as an actual currency where possible, more of that is needed to pave the road to its eventual success.
Whether or not that success eventually comes to pass remains to be seen, we can speculate all we want, but only time will tell. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:15:37
One of the many reasons it’s here is because too many people are using it as a get rich scheme, rather than an actual alternative to our existing currency system. 
Until we evolve out of this train of thought then I think it has no real future.

Good work dude, that was a great interview, clear and concise. The news reporter was also pretty cool and didn’t seem to really have an agenda other than to just ask questions and listen.
Great job ��

That’s pretty damn cool!
