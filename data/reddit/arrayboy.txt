Eth has scaling issues and security flaws. Bcash hasnt got enough volume yet to hit its ceiling.
There are three domains inherent to designing crypto blockchains; Decentralisation, Security and Scalability.
You only get to pick two of the three.
Its a computer engineering problem that every crypto faces. It requires and engineering solution.

Other coins will have better solutions to achieve other things. It will never make bitcoin anything less than the best investment.

I believe the exact opposite is likely to happen, if bitcoin forks ChinaCoin will be sold instantly and the bag holders will ultimately lose out on any decent profit from selling.

Hello, take into account the various separatists of each religion who each pick and choose certain elements of their bible paraphrasing the same statements continuously and disregarding everything else that might be unconventional to their agenda.
(1) The same scenario can be seen unravelling in r.btc, the title of the whitepaper gets thrown around 
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
and not much attention is paid to its contents,  additionally the statements made by satoshi himself that scaling solutions would have to be off-chain "additional layers" is completely ignored in that circle.
(2) I wouldn't disagree that with the unprecedented growth of crypto it would be very difficult for any coin to not rise in value. 
Does this help?
