Lightning Network is a good step in right improvement direction but it's not there yet. LN will not give you same safety as main bitcoin network  also LN have been around for a while and I don't still see any change in how people transact with bitcoins
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:11:38
so lets leave bitcoin as good place to store value  -  I  am ok with that and use other crypto for other things
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:39:45
But can you withdraw your BTC from LN at any time ?
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:19:57
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:12:21
I think you are referring to multi signature transactions on ETH
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:40:21


I agree with you that the safest store of value is in the coin that most people use - and Bitcoin is that for now - but Bitcoin protocol is not a best block chain protocol out there . 
And what would you say if ETH overtook marketcap of Bitcoin that almost happend in 2017 and 2018  - you would say ETH is a king and all other as shitcoins? thats BS
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:53:40
if you would like LN analogy to Dollar it would be better to say that  Bitcoin is like gold and LN is like dollar that supposed to represent of underlying value of gold
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:28:41
so how much would it cost me in fees and how long it would take ( opening LN channel, sending btc, closing channel) to send 0.001BTC from my one wallet to other using lighting network channel
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:25:24
Just explaining to you what market cap is and what it means
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:41:37
thats my point - is it really a Bitcoin? or its something else? it seem thats something else
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:28:44
They dont need to follow the same path, they can avoid previous mistakes and concentrate on one feature not all of them
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:09:10
yes, current supply * price not a total supply * price
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:11:22


 maintaining the ledger is not only valuable because people find it valuable but also because it require significant work to do that.
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:50:28
dollar is totally different story 
but as you said " potential written transactions " is better name
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:06:50
you are saying they can not do what bitcoin protocol does?
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:54:18
Value of work - cost of electricity + amortization cost of computer equipment. And your analogy is not accurate.
First of all processing transaction on block chain changing the state of the system. Second of all even in your example this work of dinging and filling hole has value its just that there state after is the same as before. The hole will not dig and fill by itself there fore there must be work put into and work has value.
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:32:03
maybe token is a wrong word to use - maybe a smart contract would be better
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:48:21
" potential written transactions " thats much better name then calling it a BTC
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:20:29
yes, they just pissed on Alts because of theirs price and that they lost money on them and Bitcoin is coming back to ATH .
They can do what ever they want but the problem is that when you say that all alts are shit you discouraging potential alts supporters and by that you hurting those alts developers that are working really hard on improving and spreading blockchain technology - and by that you hurting mass adoption of blockchain technology and  Bitcoin as well
@_date: 2019-07-23 18:23:56
whats your question ?
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:16:26


you are absolutely right
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:09:17
ok, I have another analogy for you :
If bitcoin is a dollar the LN is like a bank that operates virtually on you balance denominated in $ . It does not physically transfer paper dollar bills from let say my vault to another when I am sending money from one account to other. Its a custodian institution that can lose my money.
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:53:20
I am not saying somebody will patent Bitcoin - although there were attempts 
I am saying you can patent small portions of the technology - you change a little , you add a little and its new and its palatable.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:25:16


You are right you dont use ETH as store of value - you use it for other things. 
I would be not so sure about Bitcoin transaction volume - most of this volume is from exchanges transactions not actual peoples transactions. 
And by just setting the huge price and and amount of tokens will not give the specific token huge market cap - to do that you need huge amount of money that will purchase those tokens. 
Also I am not saying that market cap necessary reflect network size but its good indicator of where people put their trust in
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:06:21
I disagree - backing up any of currencies by any asset does not make any sense - if you do that then its simply centralized currency that need trust in the asset provider   and its not much different then current fiat currency - so its not a competition for Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:59:08
ok, so you transacting with BTC on bitcoin blockchain but you transacting Balances on LN - can we agree on that?
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:00:30
you are underestimating patent law, especially US patent law ,
even small portion of patented code or solution can destroy usability of whole system
thousands of patents has been already  filled
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:05:07
its not but I am not sure if using LN is better then just using other crypto
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:11:55
not only cash system - its much, much more then that
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:02:37


I agree that competition for the same protocol doesn't make sense and only one will survive at the end anyway - but when it comes to block chain you can not have max speed and max safety at the same time - something has to give - you can have speed with less safety or more safety with less speed so at least you need 3 protocols - one for max safety, one for max speed and one for combination of both. 
Beside that blockchain is much more then just currency its a way to use trust less system to other interactions between people or machines  and for that you need other protocols    
You can not make one that fits all - the one that fits all is usually crap.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:31:19


@_date: 2019-07-11 20:41:58
yes, litecoin its just fork of bitcoin so its almost identical but how do you think the other protocols were created  - they took bitcoin source code and modified it
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:00:21
I am not saying that you can patent Bitcoin 
But by patenting small portions of blockchain technology you making area of free legal use smaller and smaller 
And I am sure that those big companies and their lawyers know what they doing and know how they can get some patents
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:42:44
yes, but you talking about price fluctuation 
in that case sometimes it would be better sometimes it would be worst
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:54:32
online acutions are not patented neither but " Buy it now" button is patented by Ebay
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:25:32
That's my point - not all alts are shitcoins. 
Think about this if there was no Bitcoin but only alts right now and Bitcoin protocol would enter the market right now - how would you call bitcoin then? shitcoin? because its protocol is not better has less features then some other alts on market right now?   Think about that
Competition leads to improvement and its a good thing.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:45:23
relative to BTC - not your right, but relative to other assets not true
but what I meant it was more from the point of transaction fee and network security  its quite similar or maybe even better
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:56:36
I know you can not stop bitcoin without stopping the internet but you are missing my point
also try to legally register business that own torrent site and have profit from it
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:11:53
I don't know - sometimes when you trying to withdraw it says you have to wait till network transaction costs are lower
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:36:40


I don't agree - I think you transacting virtual BTC balances on LN - when you withdraw from LN wallet then the transaction is recorded on BTC network and then it becomes BTC in your wallet
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:13:35
you brought up good example
I like to compare Bitcoin protocol to IP protocol  - IP was revolutionary because of making data transmission spread out onto different routes in network to make it fast , safe and resistant to failure as long as network is big  vs old peer to peer connections. Blockchain protocol offers the same type of revolution allowing us to have trustless transactions  as long as network is big. 
So IP protocol evolved right now we adopting IPv6 and there are other for other uses and there where others that didn't make it.
And regarding your examples if there were no competition we would be stuck with vinyls and although they are great to listen to the music you will not watch movie from them 
Also flowing your logic - why we need all of those different type of cars ? should be only one original type that we would use for Sunday ride and to transport 5 tons of oranges from CA to NY ?

 "Some alts have some of the above properties. No alt has all of them. " - a lot of them have all the properties of bitcoin + more  because there where build base on bitcoin protocol
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:36:35
eth, litecoin, monero,dash, etc.  - I am not saying they are better then Bitcoin in general - they have different uses and for use cases they are focus on they are better
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:55:07
Some - yes but why not all?
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:27:07
you are only saying about fees inside LN but to my BTC from one wallet appear in my other wallet you need to add transaction fee required so this  transaction can be added to main Bitcoin blockchain  from LN.
LN is great but its for transactions with POS that have lot of transaction - its not very helpful for single small transaction of BTC between 2 people
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:28:03
you have the same type of decentralized trust less networks for a lot of other coins
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:33:12


For your information I don't like Rodger nor BCH project and I don't own any BCH but if I had to pay for my coffee in crypto I would prefer to use BCH no BTC for that simple reason that it would cost me less.
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:35:29


 whats your question ?
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:14:42
Only transaction to and from LN wallet to BTC are secured by bitcoin blockchain  - whats happening inside LN is not secured by BTC blockchain - can you imagine losing your BTC on bitcoin block chain? if it could happen nobody will use Bitcoin blockchain - but it happens a lot on LN that a transaction is lost and you loose your founds .
If I dont own my private keys to my BTC and instead they are on somebody's else comp/noodle then I am sorry but for me its custodian
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:24:44
are you a child? of course I am not saying its exactly the same thing
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:01:30
its recorded on blockchain because I am sending BTC to my LN wallet when I opening the channel and when I withdraw BTC from LN wallet its recorded again - is't it?
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:02:36
Try to find those trend on regular chart
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:44:26


I call it token because I don't know how to call it ? smart contract denominanet in BTC? - but its not Bitcoin for sure since its not recorded on BTC block chain
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:11:54
so how can I send BTC from exchange to my wallet or send BTC from my one wallet to other using LN and avoid BTC transaction fees?
Because this is the most common transaction I do  with BTC right now
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:09:06
I know exactly what it is  - but it doesn't change what patent law is
sure you can not respect the patent law but this put you in illegal activity bracket
@_date: 2019-11-28 15:37:34
I am thinking around $7800
@_date: 2019-08-02 03:45:29

I am not saying that Chinese crypto is better then Bitcoin nor any minable cryptocurrency - I am saying that Chinese gov making much more progress in crypto space then US gov . US gov is shooting itself in foot working on over regulations instead making progress in the space

Best time was at beginning of Bitcoin .  But we still need couple more years for mass adoption  and transfer from $ paper money to crypto.

@_date: 2019-06-13 14:38:17
Yes, the top chart have better defined trend
There is no missing data gaps - its different representation on time data
see some more samples of these charts at  [
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:52:26
I did not say it would - this show only potential if it would replace totally monetary system or just be as gold for sore of value. In my opinion next peak should be around 50k - 80k and in long therm after it should stabilize after couple of ears around $200 k
@_date: 2019-06-13 04:15:43
Trend lines and averages are the basics of technical  analysis. If you don't believe in trend lines / technical technical  analysis  then you don't believe in statistics that is math so you don't believe in math...
Anyway this is not a topic of this post - the topic is can you see difference in those two charts - they show the same data but in different way and that change everything
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:50:36

 Bitfinex / Tether scam or not -  have not much to do with bitcoin price - you could see on charts that news about it had not much effect on chart
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:24:27
So the Blue Charts were right !!! - we broke out from the long term down trend. It is so good to have access to Blue Charts and have this advantage over all other people who use regular charts. Now Blue Chart offer 7 day access for only $5  -[try it yourself](
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:34:59
It may bounced back from the down resistance trendline as we did before and go stay in this long term down trendline and go back to ~$3000 - we need the price to close above this down trendline tomorrow on daily then we will have our conformation. And right now everything looks good, a lot of other technicals are changing to bull too
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:38:43
If people start selling their bitcoin on exchange  the price would go down not up
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:30:48
Looks like Bitcoin is consolidating above Blue Chart long term down trendline - it may still retest it from above but it looks like the long term down trend is over finally !!!!!
@_date: 2019-05-03 01:47:33
If you knew anything about charts and technical analysis then you would know that my other posts are about different set ups. This breakout on  Blue Chart is completely new set up . And lets hope it will confirm on daily then the down trend is over. Mark my words
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:31:29
You can see it going up but you don't know if the long term down trend is over or not - as you can see on Blue Chart we had some rallies before to top of down trend channel but we didn't break trend line and confirm so we went back to the bottom of trend channel
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:39:53
And if you just transfer your btc to other exchange then it would have no impact on price whatsoever
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:57:50
It works but as all indicators and techniques it is not 100% bullet proof as markets always have some unexpected incidents. Using Blue Charts just give you much more accuracy when using trends and trend breakouts in your analysis. The regular charts gives you a lot of fake breakouts or delayed breakouts and Blue Charts don’t.  To have a perfect chart you have to take into consideration not just a price and time but also the amount of trades, amount of participants, order book and other exchanges trades - Blue Charts does that ....
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:45:36
Yes, he does ;)
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:40:15
yes, those indicating reversal too, and its a good sign. But if you want to see reversal on trend analysis  you dont see it on regular chart but you can clearly see it on Blue Chart
