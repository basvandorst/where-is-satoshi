I do own a gun, but I rather not shoot anybody over this amount of money.

It's a large sum of money, I needed someone to come with me for safety, hence the wife.

Thank you, I wished I was not too careless, I just didn't think that someone would sneak up to the car like that.

They slashed my tire, then followed me to a gas station, when I was distracted putting air in the rear tire, they opened the passenger side front door and stole the money.

This was my mistake, I was greedy trying to buy in the dip that I didn't care about this guy has no history and also went over my normal trading limit.

Thank you for your understanding

If you buy large amount on exchanges, they require KYC and will report you. I like the privacy of trading peer to peer.

Unfortunately not, I they only allow Max Character 3 Numeric and Upper Case w/ .,:;!?$

I've done many many trade on LBC and have no problems. You need to make sure that the person you're dealing with has good history (feedback, trade volume, trade number, account age). I have a very good standing account on LBC, does anyone has any suggestion on how I can help?
