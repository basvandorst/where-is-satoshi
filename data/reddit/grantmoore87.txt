Some people are still optimistic!

Tch! Another pseudo bitcoin intellect.

How is this linked to bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:59:59
Agree with Arthur Hayes

Californians are early adopters! This is an example!

Yeah, I expected it to go over the roof but this is the exact depiction of what's happening with me right now
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:57:59
In a nutshell!
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:58:54
He has Bitcoins himself ������
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:25:22
Another nail on the banking system coffin.

Great video!
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:40:48
Haha busted!
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:35:49
Bud, it would be kickass, trust me!
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:02:25
Governments! time to get some Inspirations
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:40:09
I don't know what to say!

The logo should change color with the movements. Green when bitcoin is up and red when it's down.
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:38:31
True, Do you think just donation would suffice? but Educating for adoption is also important
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:35:25
I actually like the idea. Since Hayek was the first to kind of having this idea, 0.1 can be Hayek?
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:02:55
Damn, it a pain here! and for crypto, they deliberately hold up or make new processes
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:59:46
I think the app has a feature for crypto portfolio. So, the return can be both, Plus or minus depending upon the bitcoin rate.

 I actually like the idea. Since Hayek was the first to kind of having this idea or hope whatever, 0.1 can be Hayek?

Our Youtube recommendations are quite similar tbh!

"I have been saying it for years".
who are you?
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:42:16
Nah, not a good idea. Using your own hardware is the best way!
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:10:11
Haha! I second that. We would be coming across Legit scams then!
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:55:07
That's how the Irish say it, Happy days!
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:43:05
The only problem bitcoin is facing right now. Otherwise its all glory!
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:42:42
Estonia, I suppose!
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:30:10
Hahaha xD 
I just checked out the website. Looks kind of cool but then they don't serve US costumers. TCH!
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:11:56
DAMN!!!! quite some news
@_date: 2019-09-23 15:43:47
Haha, this is awesome! Where is this?
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:55:35
Do you think Satoshi would have bitcoins in his wallet? I am thinking not. He feels like more of a sane man!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:03:29
This is some bad photoshop and grammatical skills
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:46:45
Agreed! Revolut just wants to get the buzz. and apparently people are giving it what it wants.
