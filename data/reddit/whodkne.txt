The generally accepted part is going to be tricky. With a society use to the protections of the credit card racket it will be hard to push a format which has none of those. The intermediary component will be the killer app.

What happens when all the bitcoin is stolen? :)
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:38:03
Bitcoin isn't good for any purchase where you don't have 100% reliability in a seller to deliver the goods. So almost never for online purchases. This is a major barrier to adoption.
@_date: 2016-08-21 03:30:48

"centralised[sic]" ... didn't that even feel just a wee bit odd posting to a bitcoin sub?  
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:39:37
First, I have to point out the hypocrisy of your statement in this context. What is the harm of centralization? Bitcoin is the solution to centralized financial control. Most here are hugely against this and thus support Bitcoin for mainly that reason. That is what is wrong, as a big glaring issue. One huge attraction to this technological development is the removal of governmental and centralized control of our financial system especially by those large institutions. Why would anyone who supports one of the most tangible benefits of cryptocurrency be ok with a centralized solution? 
Fine, ignoring that, let's say that the LN comes online, mass merchant adoption and centralization. Then that central authority decides to change the game.. fees change, maybe they prevent new hubs unless you pay an entrance fee or maybe they throttle transactions based on who you are or what you stand for. Who knows? Doesn't matter, don't want it. I want what I think most want, decentralized solution to the economic stronghold the rich and powerful have over the masses. Big money solving problems with their own centralized solutions that can be solved otherwise doesn't make me warm and fuzzy. Especially being forced into the solution by a very questionable set of individuals. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:46
How's that going? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:04:28

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:20:50
Except in this scenario on chain transactions would be exceedingly expensive (like now, but worse). So, either I lock up funds with some centralized processor or pay a ton in fees. Nope, better and cheaper solutions will win out by user choice. As the populous becomes more informed better choices will be made. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:12:31
But requires adoption from users who have no real incentive to use this over other, simpler use scenarios. Lower fees, increased capacity, faster transactions, better dev team, less centralized control, etc. Seems like cramming down user's throats a solution that has many hurdles to overcome before it's even ready to beta. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:31:01
Not following. I don't want Fox or any other news program and am not sure what part of my post you are referring to. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:28:38


That doesn't make it right. Ignorance of the importance of holding your keys does not make valid the idea of centralizing nodes.

So if this non existent "company" with a fake existence can engage in this kind of disrupting activity with relative ease...does that not say ask it needs to say about stress testing right there? If anyone can disrupt the network then we have a problem. The blockchain needs ddos protection.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:18:20
Many other cryptos. Merchants will take whatever payment methods are easiest and cheapest. Don't think bitcoin core is the only one going to develop solutions to the world's spending. When a merchant can accept any crypto with a single provider they won't care about lightning. They care the funds are in their account. When wallets handle any crypto the user has more and easier choices. Bitcoin's Monopoly is first to market but that only lasts so long.

@_date: 2017-12-20 19:39:20
Who needs to refute anything? What those people may have done does not represent those who hold those coins. It does not change the fact that the coin exists because the BTC devs have many issues of their own. Since I hold the same amount of each coin I want both coins to succeed, that is the best outcome for me. But even more ideal would have been for BTC to adjust to market needs. However, the first round of "bad devs" started here, and still exists here. Throwing stones in glass houses, as they say.  
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:28:06

So are you saying the VMDK or whatever datastore file is used for the VM is susceptible to attack as well? Because if I create it without a NIC then that seems like it would be the only access.

@_date: 2014-02-09 00:30:44
Heh... I have been reading many threads about similar situation and in many of them a comment like this is posted. I have no idea what would prompt someone to make up this kind of story. I've been on reddit for a while so I'm not trying to troll or something. 
Since I noticed this (minutes before I posted on reddit) I closed all the coin applications I have. I downloaded the latest AdAware and Malwarebytes and am running them now. I don't *think* I have 5 coin left in the wallet.. according to my spreadsheet there was only around 21 coin in my wallet.dat so there may be some fraction there. I think you are referring to the 5 coin that are left in the criminal's address maybe? 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:40:47
Yes, is that a problem for you? I want to get as much info about crypto as possible. Doesn't mean I agree with it all.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:33:27
Thanks, I sort of thought about that problem. I suppose I could create new wallets and move from the old to new and print the new direct from the cold laptop. That seems to be one of my largest security issues right now. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:35:03
Yea? I've used them... probably tried out 5 or 6 and they seemed pretty well setup. I still wonder about the whole security/web wallet thing. I've seen others discuss the fact that you can't trust any web wallet, never leave much in there, etc. But how can you trade on a more regular basis without doing this? Doesn't make much sense. So I wonder if, like some web wallets, there are ways to hold your private keys and pass the "xkey" or whatever it is. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:51:59
That is one of the worst hypothesis I've ever read. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:12:39
Even then... you just don't know. I thoguht I had fairly conversative usage habits compared to most I know.. I know many of them are way less secured because I have to clean their systems when they get infected. The layer of obscurity between safe and unsafe is not very blurry... and you may just never know until it is too late.

@_date: 2014-02-08 23:26:21
The actual password that is used for encryption is not stored anywhere. The last time I entered it must have been in another client (litecoin or mincoin or somewhere) that I was also encrypting. So I can only imagine that it was logged and used against my bitcoin wallet since it was used in another wallet it was a decent target. 
Edit - last used in the last day or two as I have been mining on multipool and wanted to get the coins off those various places (cryptsy, multipool) and on to my system and eventually in to a cold wallet.

@_date: 2014-12-20 18:07:47
I don't know the figures, but accounting for in person/physical transactions  needs to be paramount. Sure, phone to phone transactions will be doable.. what happens when my phone is out of battery, no connectivity, etc. I guess I am relating the need to physical money or promisary notes (checks included) where power and internet connectivity are hard to come by. Yes, getting the transaction to the block chain is a hurdle but maybe we need to discuss off-chain transactions between two people directly that can be submitted later by one of those parties without question of authenticity or funds. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:24:43
Obviously I understood the risk and downside of having the coins there, hence the planning on moving. But...fuck... if this is ever going to be a practical replacement currency, which I am ALLLLL in favor of, this kind of shit can't happen. 
I don't even know where to start now with looking for the malicious software. I guess I'll do the typical malware scans ... I really don't want to reformat again.

@_date: 2014-02-08 23:31:42
Yeah, I encrypted all of the wallets with the same. Not that it would have mattered because if I have a keylogger then it would have gotten the bitcoin password at some point. Thanks..

The only two I think I installed since my reformat are Mincoin and Dogecoin. Both from the official sites, both confirmed. It looks like Malware bytes is finding several things so it may very well be something else I downloaded. I have deluge torrent client as well as Actual Multiple Monitors... so maybe it was somewhere else. I have the downloads so I can look at them if there is a way to see. I guess I can see if MalwareBytes finds anything in them. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:50:36
"Right now" ... exactly... the mass adoption is the larger part of the global population and Windows is prevalent.

Very possibly.

Makes sense. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:06:47
Just because it is not worth the time of someone here to "crack" that private key does not mean that small amounts stored across wallets is a secure way to store cryptos. Because ab is true does not mean ba is true.

To your son: Great work on that paper. It's obvious you followed the guidelines set out for the assignment and it is plain to see that you did a lot of research and put a lot of time and effort in to explaining your ideas and opinions. It's sad that you received the kind of response you did but it is also a life lesson. Later in life you will encounter these kinds of situations in the world, in relationships and in your job. Your dad is a very smart man, follow his lead and learn from him how to handle these kinds of situations so you make the most of them. You did not fail on this assignment in any way, shape or form. 
Dad: Awesome. On every fricken level, way to go. Please make sure to update us as to the progress of your discussions with the teacher and anything beyond that might happen. As others have said, do us proud and have level headed conversations and include your son as much as possible when it makes sense. It's so awesome to see parents involved, kids who gobble it up and the kind of mind opening and expanding ideas that you have obviously helped bring in to his life. Kudos. 
To both of you, I have been in the bitcoin arena for a long time and while I read everything, I've never once used changetip or put money in an account. Tonight for the first time I signed up and you are getting my first changetip. However, I instruct you to use it as you both see fit... college fund, an ice cream cone or whatever makes you happy. Here's to some good people, 2 hugs for you guys @_date: 2014-12-20 18:27:18
Well that's the hurdle. I'm wondering about offline signed transactions that have some sort of guaranteed authenticity and could be one sided import to the blockchain. I don't understand the blockchain technology enough to know if this is possible currently or ever but thus combined with sine device to make it easy and automated once you have connectivity seems like a strong solution.

Furthermore, I'm not sure what the course of action is now, even if I have any coin left. I guess I have to make an off-line wallet for every kind of coin I have? But if I open the wallet app for whatever coin and type in password doesn't that expose me to further loss? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:09:19
Common people use Windows. If it isn't on windows they won't be able to use it. Unless there is a huge paradigm shift in popular OS you have to cater to the lowest common denominator if you want mass consumption.

@_date: 2014-02-08 23:30:49
Yeah, I have a Mint Linux VM I just installed... I have to stick with windows for work reasons (we are a windows based web development company) but obviously I could have handled these transactions/software differently. 
As with all bad/stupid things I do I will definitely use it as a learning experience. I am just so stunned. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:20:37
No. The encryption password is a very long sequence of random characters. It is based off a password I use but never this combination before. I have used it in other wallets, so that has me concerned.
I downloaded the latest client from the website and verified the signature.

So moving the whole balance where? Say my hot wallet is empty and I want to send a few bits to Wikipedia. Do I need to move the entire cold wallet balance to an online wallet first? The send whatever I want back to a NEW cold wallet? 
When I first got in to bitcoin I figured quick, easy, online wallets, send, receive, like paypal. I understand *why* we don't want centralized controllers of the infrastructure but not being able to really trust online wallets or your connection to them is making use of bitcoin a real thorn.

I can't talk intelligently enough about network hash rate versus difficulty, bubbles, China trading and fake volume, fake trading bots or the like. What I can imagine, however, is world event changers. Look at oil. I don't follow markets or news closely enough to know if there were predictions of this coming for the oil markets (at least as drastically as it did, or how the Saudi's responded). I am imagining some larger world events that bring bitcoin, and similar technological solutions to existing, long term problems, to the forefront of mainstream media and popular thought. Those kind of game changers (market crashes, elections, disasters, etc) could easily propel bitcoin in to a much larger role in remittance and store of value and transfer. Of course, as you posted, if things stay on track (additional acceptance by larger entities, additional startups and funding via BC) and rewards halve then we should be looking at a really nice place for us who have stuck with it. I bought today at 236 and I'll be buying sub $200 when it happens. I bought at 4 and 500 as well and I'll be nicely offsetting those paper losses with some really cheap coin. Of course nothing offsets the hurt of 20 coins stolen that I got at around $10, grrr. Live and learn, that was a year or more ago now.

They haven't built out any new hardware, as the statement implies. Sure the new platform they are hosting on is new to them, but that title is misleading. They moved to a cloud system; from what infrastructure we don't know. Could have been a few desktop computers under a desk somewhere. Scrutiny should be accepted EVERYWHERE in dealing with this situaiton, they were hacked and have been less than forthcoming as to the SPECIFIC issue that eixsted and what they did to solve the SPECIFIC issue.

I wasn't yelling anything. I was stating fact, threads I have seen deleted. It's not like I'm claiming there is some mysterious man in the sky who watches everything you do and judges you. I'm saying I've seen threads deleted and it's clear the content and topic of the thread was not wanted and so it was removed. That is censorship. You can't argue against fact, it is what it is. The fact that you keep trying to pigeonhole me into a specific group to make yourself feel better or distance me from this sub over another is so laughably defensive it's almost as if you wanted to overreach. In either case, I am just reporting what I see. Again, I don't know and don't care which solution is better. I haven't spent enough time understanding the technicalities. I can't even recall who is on which side or what the names of each "group's bitcoin" is. I just want a currency that takes over the world and whatever is needed let's do it. The stupid childish squabbling is so pedantic. Amazing that big companies can't seem to see what is best for the bottom line. Short term profits over long term gains. I sure as hell hope this doesn't in a huge ball of flame because of the infighting. 
So again, I am on neither side. I don't post at all, read both subs and hodl and spend. I sell on local as well. That's all I've got man.

I'm just sitting here reading both subs. I have absolutely no skin in the game except I want bitcoin to succeed. However it does that, whatever works out the best, that's what I want. However, I do see the censorship. It's hard not to when it's documented. I don't mine, I don't know the code, I don't know the technical details of either side, barely do I know the arguments for either side and even then not really. What i see is a bunch of political, childish bullshit that pollutes both sides. How all of these people who seemingly want the same thing can be so at odds and can see no common ground is so self destructive it is almost laughable. 
Your reply to me, that's a perfect example. "OOOOOO you're X person! Boooo!!" Reminds me of the democrats during the primary, that worked out well. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 08:12:41
If your priority is the continued success of bitcoin you would figure out how to stop making many people feel you are being a jerk. Bring somewhat self aware you should realize that if you are a self proclaimed ambassador of the coin then you hold a responsibility, otherwise you should let someone else handle the oligarchy. Following the debacle for far too long it has cast a shadow over something I used to enjoy investing my time and effort in to learning and reading about. I continue to see augment after argument, finger pointing and posturing and that is unflattering to all involved. Step up and lead a path to a solution not a standoff.

We can all armchair what Coinbase should and shouldn't do and speculate about their decisions but I think it's also fair to say that CB doesn't really run the most competent business and doesn't always make decisions that are the best for it's users. So their choice moving forward on the BCC front shouldn't really be an indicator for the industry. I personally have a bias as I have had more than my fair share of issues with CB but at the same time so have many others here based on the pro/con posts. Again, very skewed data but I can make the reverse argument that CB has no damn clue what they are doing and have shown time and again to not be able to handle demand on their services nor on their support side (which continues to this day). 
Shit, I keep getting emails from them (on the BCC situation was the latest) when I have zero active accounts with them (they closed mine and my wife's). Can't unsubscribe, reply-to is null and their support is absolutely worthless in both response time and competency. So I just have to block their emails so I don't have to deal with their BS in my inbox. 
For all the good they have done, my mini rant now coming to an end, they don't show the most competency in business process and decision making.

Half-hearted? How so? "No Segwit" isn't an argument, it's the point. 
Name and ticker confusion has been perpetuated by those who don't want BCH to succeed. It won't matter in the end as there will only be one BTC and likely BCH will take that back. 
Fees weren't lower, they were higher for some time. Miners also aren't stupid, they want longevity for the expenses they have into that equipment. They want more transactions and growth. Not stagnation for years of feuding conglomerates trying to mold bitcoin to be what they want. They want stability and larger blocks, it seems.

@_date: 2017-08-23 14:22:18
You're concern may have some validity but your reasoning is flawed. Pricing attacks out of the equation is never going to happen and sacrificing usability through abnormally high fees for the entirety of the network is the lowest form of protection. BTW, no shit they'd be more expensive with higher fees, that's literally the definition. The argument has been defended ad nauseum here, it's moot.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:05:11
I love the speculation. As if anyone can reliably strategize with any certainty in this kind of unknown situation. So many moving pieces and, while everyone here is a so confident in selling to make a profit there are likely others who are waiting to buy low and hodl for the inevitable upswing that we have seen time and again with BTC. Instead of being happy with new found wealth opportunities here it's all doom and naysayers. If anything happens that the core folks here keep preaching about, no skin lost and BTC gets some media attention. If the BCH side of things upticks then there are new opportunities and even more media attention that can be had. Dissolvement of the brand should be less of a concern at these early stages when no one outside the financial or tech sectors knows about bitcoin. I post and talk about it over and over, talking about the gains and markets and still none of my facebook contacts take me up on offers to adopt. It's not big yet, but it will be and BCH can be a part of that, it doesn't have to be exclusive.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:51:12
Cold headed? Seriously?
Some of the most vocal core devs have, to put it lightly, disturbing social interactions and flawed common sense. Not to mention huge lapses in judgement of widely accepted scientific study.

@_date: 2017-08-24 05:44:26
There are a hundred or whatever who have committed code, but that doesn't make the representative of the project. The most active, vocal and obtuse are the issue. 
If someone has beliefs like he does I would severely question how that does not affect the mental acuity and judgement skills of the individual. You aren't just "writing" code, you're making crucial decisions and designing an infrastructure no matter macro or macro. If your brain is ok with being an amatuer scientist and rejecting common knowledge and scientific fact then I would definitely question the decision making skills of that person. That doesn't mean the code can't be good, but how that doesn't bring to question competency I just don't know.

No correlation by anyone at all in this thread that you have backing their solution and bitcoin.com backing their solution? Do you all not see the irony? Long enough the antics of a few who possess the power to control the discussion have gone on. With each step the opposition grows stronger and fights with more tools. Yet every vile post, every "retard" (you users of this phrase should all get a better vocabulary) post, every "us versus them" is an action that causes a reaction. "He" isn't causing this and "he" isn't blocking that. He, we, are a self sustaining echo chamber of self destruction. Keep up the petty, self centered idealogy and we will end up being surpassed by something newer and shinier. We've seen it happen already.. "exchange your bitcoin for token X and we'll gladly pay you Tuesday..." So just wait until the is enough incentive to exchange your bittokens for something shinier and more promising. Then who is the "core" team.

I can tell you the one issue I've had with all other tracking methods is importing &amp; coin/token availability. I use 10+ different exchanges and no one service I have found has import functions for all. Yes, some exchanges limit API functionality, so no fault there. Tokens, if listed on coinmarketcap or are in my ETH address, should be available (many others don't do this). Also, an import of the major blockchain addresses you hold would be nice (cointracking.info tries to do this but the available coins are few). Looks pretty but cointracking.info has loads more functionality for my tracking purposes. I would like something like you are doing, but it would also need a web presence (or at least a mobile app).

I think you are taking great liberties with not only your outrageous statements, while providing nothing in terms of evidence, but your obtuse language dramatizing him and his campaign. Plenty of people who have records just as outstanding as him (look at his record, he has been on the right side of history EVERY time) are speaking out passionately. 
Robert Reich has to be one of the most touted economists in recent history and he has shown full support for Bernie and his policies. 
Any other candidate on either side is completely beholden to corporations and billionaires so any argument that someone else has better ideas is ridiculous. He is the only candidate looking out for us, the people and not the special interest groups. 
Let's hear some specifics with some researched based evidence that can justify your points.

I don't think that is any measure of him. Comparing him to Obama means little. But we also know Obama has been stifled by a republican congress. Bernie has been adamant that we need a congress of people who aren't bought and paid for as well. 
Really to me it is a no brainer. I'm no political anything... never cared about politics before in my life. But this guy is amazing. Never lied, never wavered, always on the right side of history. His net worth is 300k. He's been on welfare in his life. He does not have rich parents. He is not a career politician beholden to huge conglomerates and superPacs. He is the longest term independent in history. He called out so many people ahead of his time, Greenspan is a great video. The guy just wants everyone to have a fair shake, not hand them the keys. He is a Democratic Socialist, a difference from a traditional Socialist. A lot of his policies are in effect in European countries and the quality of life is staggeringly better than ours. We are the only industrialized nation to not have guaranteed maternity leave and guaranteed health care. We do not care for our citizens. How screwed up is that? We're not talking radical ideas, we're talking common and moral sense.

The issue all revolves around who funds elections. If the Koch brothers want to spend billions on an election doesn't that say something? Is that how our political system should work? That corporations and billionaires can influence an election so drastically? OF course those politicians they help get elected would never vote against what the people want in lieu of what those who paid for their election want, right? 
Big money should not be in politics. People are people, not corporations, corporations do not get to fund elections. Publicly funded elections are where we should go. The elected officials should work on the will of ALL of the people, not just the rich.

Only one of those things makes sense, but the term "effective" tells me that it has more overhead than just raising the block size, because that could be accomplished otherwise. 
Malleability I don't understand, the document linked didn't help. 
2nd layer scaling I don't understand the need for. Why can't bitcoin scale? It seems like what is preventing scaling right now is the block size limit. Why would we not solve that issue when it was meant to not be limited?

Um. That's a very liberal use of those terms. I'm a developer and still don't understand half of what was said in that document, nevermind the grammatical errors. 
That document could have been similar to a voters guide you get in the mail. Pros and cons, easy for most to understand. 


Why would a miner modify the transaction? 
Really, it doesn't answer my question. I asked why YOU wanted it, but you didn't answer, you just pointed me to a document that uses very specific language that is highly technical to those who understand the inner workings of transaction components and signing, not to mention malleability which the document glosses over. 
There is a nice graph, without numbers and a paragraph that gives some figures as to an increase in signature operations and hashing but again glosses over why, how.. just 


If this document were to be giving me a WHY then it isn't doing that. It's giving me a "it does this and that" but no why. 
Who wrote this? Why isn't it signed by someone(s)? I still have no reason to buy into what it says because it doesn't give me a tangible reason why I want it, just what it accomplishes.

Yea, so invalid argument. You can't claim undo stress that would cripple the entire existence and not have any quantification. Frankly, I ask because it sounds wholly unlikely. Storage is not even a valid consideration, it's dirt cheap. Processing power can't likely be an issue with block size but I can see that probability. I was hoping someone more technically knowledgeable would chime in. Since this is such a lynchpin in the arguments I'd like to know. I've yet to see any significant discussion on the topic. Maybe I missed it.

What I came here to say, and I did in another comment. I keep reading posts on both subs where the poster insinuates that there are some binding rules or guidelines that are set forth and that some group of people is trying to corrupt those. Or that we should be following what some other group of people is saying because they have (choose one or more: experience, technical knowledge, lots of money, political clout, been around a long time, more bitcoin than most, own a mining farm, own a pool, speak about bitcoin professionally). 
The 22nd century problem we are facing is who makes decisions in a decentralized world. The outcome of this will be precedent. Already too much infighting has been going on among supporters and we have a few people who sit with money and/or power telling the users what should happen and controlling the discussion through various means. 
How to solve this problem is larger than how to solve the scaling issue.

Over and over, an "us v. them" mentality, down to the splintering of the subs. It's a very exclusionary mentality and puts at odds people who wouldn't and shouldn't. Even calls for a compromise make it understood that it isn't a single choice over another. It's a protocol and infrastructure that should be shaped and molded to be acceptable to the majority. The idea that the network must function in a specific capacity over another, that it can only perform a specific function or for a specific group is debilitating. There has to be a better way.

I've had this thought a few times, sometimes with roulette and then with BC. Sadly I didn't know enough back when I saw it at $10 to pull the trigger. The short term profit would have been awesome. Obviously on for the longer term now and no high interest borrowing but that fleeting thought still hounds me.

Actually, I was able to register via the website however when I try to login to the app with those credentials I get an error with with credentials. 
Also I tried to use the password reset from within my settings and it's giving a 404 error in Firebug.
