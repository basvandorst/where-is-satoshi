Is there a decent replacement?  My Android app displays my balance in both USD and BTC, I want to find a suitable replacement to Gox, but don't know what I should use.  It seems to be like I wouldn't want to use a single exchange, but I don't know what's best.

I haven't bought any coins in a while, haven't decided where to sell them (holding onto them for now, still trying to figure out ways to get bitcoin without spending fiat, aka selling products &amp; services)

Plus the whole brick and mortar portion of the operation, and the marketing, and the employees, and the lawyers to make sure they're in compliance with regulations.

Guess it's just fucked! Wait a day or two and try again imo

I'd take that.  I mine $6/mo.

It does, but then under THAT, I believe it says it worked.  I got that too and was able to just reset and ignore anything it told me, and it worked!

Oh I know, I know it's not going to be a net profit (especially after the crash), but it's a fun hobby.  Plus it's just extra processing power on the network.  Strength in numbers, or something like that.  Just doing my part.  But I want to be sure I'm actually doing SOMETHING rather than just doing nothing and not realizing it.

As soon as I saw the price, I jumped in the car and got to the bank and made a deposit.  I'm waiting patiently for CaVirtex to process so I can place an order.  FASTER DAMNIT!
