Some of them have real world use though...immutable public ledgers are useful for many things.
Take Guaranteed Unique Ticketing System (GUTS) for instance...mark my words; it will revolutionize the ticketing system for events sooner rather than later...and who doesn’t love events of some type???

Yes it does. Dont you know what a difficulty adjustment is??? If there were thousands of ASCI’s hashing blocks on BTC, and then all of a sudden they all went offline (like they all started mining another coin or something) and it was just the old PC in your moms basement mining BTC...well it would take A LOT longer than 10 minutes to find the next block.

That’s funny. I live in a major city and don’t even own a bike. Most of the people who I know, don’t own bikes. The ones that do, I’ve never seen use.

This comment right here proves you dont know wtf you are talking about. The difficulty adjustment only happens every 2016 blocks. If this happened even in the middle of a cycle, it would be years before the next adjustment.

Youre right mate. Sorry about the snide remark...the markets got me all riled today...
Happy holidays as well.

Are you a self taught trader? What sources did you use to learn that skill?

Why would they take donations in segwitcoin if the fees would eat the entire donation up?
That’s if it ever went through.

Your analogy is terrible and doesn’t make sense. A better one would be: 
Big blockers see a brick wall in the distance, so they plot a route that will take them 8x further and buy them some time, so they can begin working on a plan to avoid the wall altogether. 
Small blockers see a wall and keep driving up to it at full speed; After several years of fighting about the best way to avoid the wall, the occupants at the last second deploy some tail wings and draw up some plans for some side wings which might carry them over the wall. 
However, the tail wings (segwit) are too little, too late. The plans they have drawn up for the bigger wings (lightning) are about “18 months” away from being completed...problem is, small blockers don’t want to adjust their course in the mean time; so they just sit in their little metal coffin and smile at the looming wall speedily filling their windshield view, knowing full well that it will likely be their doom much sooner than the wings can ever be finished.

People don’t use something that has “a strong possibility of dropping to $0”  as a store of value...
Your other estimates also seem fairly optimistic.

I think you’re onto something...they sound like a Gazorpazorp from the Muzia’ak System.
Good job, you’re so smart!
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:24:01
Uhh because not all miners want to do something shady like that? 
100% consensus by a large group of people is for all intents and purposes...is impossible.

How is it an attack if it is open source software? Isn’t the very definition of open source the ability to copy and utilize the same code as you see fit?
Besides, SW only got activated because of an agreement that this hardfork upgrade to 2mb would happen in Novemeber...if one side says “yeaaa we already got what we want, so you can go screw yourself we don’t need to keep up our part of the agreement...” and the other side says they will do it anyway....we’ll then it’s not an attack, it’s just one side trying to uphold a deal and the other trying to abuse their power.

I THINK they buy specialized hardware, but don't quote me on that. 
I'm pretty sure the price increase is from regular people who are using GPUs to mine coins which are newer, thus have much easier blocks to mine.

Since the difficulty is pretty high for mining new bitcoin blocks, you need specialized computers to do the calculations; and they are very expensive to buy, run, and maintain. Basically only companies or people with huge amounts of capital can afford to operate them. These entities are often called mining cartels since they know they control a sizable portion of the bitcoin hash, and they often try and strong arm the users and developers into situations where they make even more money.
Even though bitcoin is touted as a decentralized currency, so long as mining cartels exist, it can't truly be called decentralized...

My question is...who will buy this garbage? It seems like everyone I see on the web is going to try and offload them asap.

Why did it get seized? What does this mean for the users of that site?
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:02:48
Except bitcoin is a world wide currency, with a huge portion of the mining cartels residing in China.

Yes the equipment is specialized for mining at such difficulties. It wouldn't make sense to utilize them for easier coins, they wouldn't make much of a profit, if any.
They would expend tons of electricity, and new blocks only get discovered when the last block is mined. Rewards for mining a new block are static (let's say 5 coins per block), and other coins are MUCH cheaper in price than bitcoin.
If you are going to be using that much power, you want to get high value coins for it.
