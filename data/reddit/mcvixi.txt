I recognize that the markets are different. Doesn't change the fact that the statement is completely moronic.

Lol what's it like to be smarter than everyone else?

"it justifies a higher price"
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:47:41
No. He said this fact about Bitcoin justifies the  higher price, which isnt correct.

I'm not gonna argue with you about whether money is sufficiently similar to money. Sorry.

I very much disagree and would say its value is 100% speculative. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:54:25
Because it isn't a virus? Its a speculative commodity? Wow I really didn't think I'd have to explain that to you. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:09:55
 the fact that it hasn't totally collapsed *yet* means nothing more right now than it did when it was launched, imo
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:45:46
Literally only this, lol. I do not understand the fanboys. It's an entirely speculative market. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:07:46
Well, no it isn't, it's a speculative commodity and toolkit, and those things (idea, information) are ALSO not viruses.

Bitcoin and Fiat are almost exactly alike, although coin is a bit more functional and perhaps less manipulated (though Im doubrful). Both are purely speculative commodities.

This is very inaccurate. I guess every day the housing bubble didn't collapse before 2008, the rising prices were always more justified??
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:33:31
wow this is really really really fucked up. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:13:12
I see your point. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:35:33
your reading comprehension is clearly sub-par so imma just dip. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:15:24
that isn't the point. you're just changing the topic.
the point: leave if you don't like it
counterpoint: that's incredibly difficult for many, nearly impossible for most, unreasonable for all

yeah so does winning a professional sports game; doesn't mean everyone has the means to do it.

just uproot your life and your family and leave everything you've ever known if your dissatisfied with any portion of it!
come on mate.
