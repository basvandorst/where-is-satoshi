I think there is some merit to the general idea that some transactions might get tainted by the actions of their owners. Think about what it would mean in general. It is a kind of decentralized law enforcement.
The other options we have to deal with crime in the Bitcoin world is to request the assistance of the state or perhaps to hire some private police. Both options appear to me to be inferior centralization of force compared to a system where you could simply eliminate or drastically reduce the incentive for crime.
Currency is supposed to be a means for facilitating honest trade, or rather, I'm sure, most people would like it to serve that purpose. It is not supposed to reward the thief for stealing from the honest merchant.
In any case I'm sure that the people will decide themselves whether they want a coin that is completely fungible and completely anonymous or perhaps a coin that disincentives crime and only rewards honest trade.
And would there be problems with the tainting? Abuse? Tendencies towards centralization? Of course, it all depends on whether a system could be engineered to make such issues unfeasible as with what is really the central theme of cryptographic technology.

I don't know much about hardware wallets but I always wondered, how do they get past the wrench to the head method of stealing bitcoin?
As long as you can personally transfer most of your wealth anybody can threaten you with force to do so especially if you can do it from the relative private confines of your home.
