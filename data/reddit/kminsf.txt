I love Paxful / its fun selling there and rewarding helping sooo many noobs get their first btc / vote manipulation? Almost certain that's a bunch of bs

Apologies to op for immediately assuming he/she was being careless -
I use Google drive for many things and after someone reminded me - shared docs via email 
That's really Sucky

Yes I've been using bitcoin for about 3 weeks and lurking on these threads - afraid to post anything also because I keep reading there are 20 scammers for every honest bitcoin user :-o

That seems to be a couple guys playing around hanging out on their friends patio and a nosy neighbor taking pictures of them -  not smart but not particularly shady imho lol

Watch out- I had a dispute on LBC and they sided with the obvious scammer!!!!  I can only assume LBC sides with liars etc if they make more money for LBC-   I'm pissed- careful trading!
