Don’t let this propaganda machine (NDAA signed into office on New Year’s Eve 2014 by Obama, allows legal use of propaganda against us citizens) they call the United States convince you that something called “FedCoin” is better. Might as well call that shit WeWantToTankBitcoinNSAPrismSurveillanceDollars... nawmsayin’?

Good thing they’re getting old and outing these politicians that sellout for literally chump change (some seriously less than $100k) is becoming more and more common. I loved the my senator sold us out posts on but when these dinosaurs are all dead soon, then we will see change. Internet is too accelerated for their shady dealings and they can’t do their dirty work behind closed doors as easily when they don’t even understand how email works. When you can just social engineer CIA Director John Brennan’s AOL (that he was using for secure govt communications... think about that) email password and see his shit, it’s a small glimmer of hope.

And you need a private or free internet to coordinate that, beware and stay vigilant

Sounds somewhat delusional. Either there’s a psyop going on to make it seem like it’s insecure by reporting all these exchange hacks, or they really are secure options, hard to say.  One thing I do know is I’d never trust the central banks. The Fed isn’t even a federal bank and they are privately owned, it’s a racket but seriously, the whole point of crypto is to get the fuck away from central banks having the influence they do over the globe for centuries. 
This is some new world order they weren’t exactly planning on, and they’re in meltdown mode figuring out how to make it fail before it becomes viewed as a viable investment. 
When they wheel out Jamie Dimon (how the fuck is this guy not in jail) to shit talk crypto and bitcoin, you know they’re threatened. 
Watch in the news, FedCoin is the new big thing they’ll push. Why would the US need that? To maintain their death grip on society

People have theorized Elon was the original pseudo author of bitcoin.

When your money is gone one day and they blame it on digital terrorists to prove a point so they can launch an endless war on economic terrorists, then tell me how you feel. First thing I’d do is go after net neutrality to stop your financial options to not have to bank w a system ruled by corrupt unjailable bankers... oh wait
