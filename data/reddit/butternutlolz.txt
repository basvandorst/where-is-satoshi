Proof of your claim that coin base complies with even more ALM/KYC then banks?

You are wrong and skysailer is correct even though he did not word it well. 
While what you said is correct, you are missing out one important component: R&amp;D and other discretionary expenditures.  All Amazon needs to do to generate billions in P&amp;L is cut their R&amp;D... Which is around 10b annually now.  Now, I know you may not have gone into this in your accting101 class, but why would a company deliberately not want to earn piles of money?  Because as long as they are barely showing a profit, their taxes are nothing... This allows them to grow faster without having to pay Uncle Sam.
This is just one of many tricks Amazon (and other companies) use to pay less to the taxman.

You clearly have not worked in a front office role at a bank.  95% of 'technology' is a cost centre to an investment bank.  The other 5% primarily is used to SUPPORT the traders.  HFT you have an argument for, but pretty much everything else is a support role which means you are paid bonus depending on your desks performance, you have no individual performance or PL.

you realize that Bitcoin is "money" that was created out of thin air too?  In addition, there is nothing preventing more bitcoins from being created.

Two Questions:
1. How does decentralization improve counterparty risk?
2. How are you quantifying counterparty risk?  Are you measuring it in fiat, or in btc?

I disagree.  From your link:


Counterparty risk is in reference to transactions and has nothing to do with custodial duties.  You are referring to custodial credit risk, which I would agree if you act as your own custodian you do not have any custodial credit risk.  I have one oz of gold hidden under my mattress and I have no intentions to transact with it, therefore I too have zero custodial credit risk and can 'be my own custodian'.  
Also, I still do not understand why decentralization improves counterparty risk?

Why do you say there is no counter party risk?
