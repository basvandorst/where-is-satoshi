Confession: It's not serious, more an absurd "what-if" scenario.
In the future, most nation states realized late in the game that the shift to crypto was unstoppable and desperately amassed their own reserves. As a result BTC moons, but the price eventually stabilizes around $1M/btc — at which point BTC becomes the de facto global reserve currency.
Along the way, the US and most other governments were forced to peg their fiat to btc and reign in inflation. (The price of btc made any attempts at inflation way too obvious.) But people began moving away from dollars. They said, "Antiquated." They said, "Doesn't travel well." They rolled their eyes and said, "So 20th century."
So the US government was forced to completely abandon fiat and issue commodity backed money once again. Mindful of "not your keys, not your bitcoin", they thought they'd be clever and issue dollars in the form of 100 sat custodial wallets — perfect timing since BTC had stabilized right around $1M.
They even printed money on this basis and wanted to ease it into acceptance — especially by those who resented the changes and wanted something physical to cling to, something familiar looking. Some people were confused by the "1", the "5", the "10", etc. on the new bills, because the bills said "Hundred Satoshi." For most of the holdouts "a buck was a buck" and worked exactly the way the old money had.
In the end however, even though you could keep an eye on whether the address printed on the bill held the bitcoin it said it did and you could count on unique addresses on every bill (it was too easy for the government to get caught doing otherwise) people moved completely away from paper. The bills remained in circulation more as a novelty than anything else — the kind of thing you'd put in a card for your nieces and nephews at Christmas time, or fold into an origami tip if you wanted to be ostentatious.
Final confession: I actually left the "1" all over the bill and cheated with "hundred satoshi" because it didn't want to spend hours redesigning the damn thing.

I thought it would be funny to depict "good money driving out the bad" for a change—borrowing some biblical imagery. Invoking Gresham's was meant to be ironic (and admittedly shallow). Enjoy!

So you can avoid using a fossil currency, but you're stuck with fossil fuel? No thanks. I'm going to stick with my Tesla. I've got an array of mining rigs in the trunk that run off regenerative braking. The car practically pays for itself and stays nice and toasty in the winter. And if anyone tries to diss my "coal-mobile", you can get stuffed. I literally live in the shadow of a massive dam. Pure hydro baby! /s

So close earlier. Just need to touch $10K for a moment to trigger a wave of headlines. Mainstream publicity, social chatter, institional rumblings, pundit concessions, family discussions, personal eurekas, tempered fomo—it's all good.

Good points.  But tbh, I was just messing around. I had no idea about the 7. And I did use the other NASA font...

Nah. It's a [painting]( I photoshopped (GIMP'd actually) back when Bernanke was still Chairman of the FED.
Oh, now I get it. If you submit a "post" wherein you just upload a file it shows up as a link. If you submit an "image" instead, your file shows up as an image. I suppose it would be bad form to delete and repost.

My take is that a wise person, i.e. sapien, tries to avoid making financial decisions driven by strong emotion, especially frenzy.

I really like this—the execution, the message, btc as a cure, etc.  
Adding my 2 sat, I'd rather see the btc symbol on the pills.  
First, the symbol is ubiquitous and easily-recognized visual shorthand. It should be part of every new person's first introduction to BTC—especially a merchant.  
Second and admittedly weak—some may make negative (subliminal) associations with Bayer, big pharma, etc. Perhaps it's better to not graft the brand of bitcoin onto something quite so recognizable.

Thanks. I only do things like this on rare occasions. I have no real body of work, and I've withdrawn almost entirely from social media. But with this kind of encouragement, I'm motivated to try more...

Decoupling BTC from the alts: They expect the flippening. They get the slippening. Right on maximalists!
