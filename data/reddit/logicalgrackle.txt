Even if that happens, some people worry that a deflationary currency would hurt our economy, and that makes them dislike Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin will have zero effect on our economy, because people want stable prices, and there will be stable currencies built on top of Bitcoin.
When people complain about deflation, correct them. When people complain about volatility, correct them. When people assume that tinkering with interest rates is the best way to manage our economy, correct them.

Correct, and that's why I think the prospect of pegging to a fixed amount of value—like a 2015 dollar—is particularly interesting. We can use price inflation statistics to determine how much a 2015 dollar is worth in any currency at any time. We can use stablecoins to create an entirely new class of currency that holds a specific value forever.

Some altcoins are worthless clones. Some add privacy features that are irrelevant because people don't care if the government can track their transactions.
But some altcoins allow stable value cryptocurrencies to be built on top of them, and it turns out that people do care about the stability of their money. This feature will happen on top of Bitcoin in a sidechain as well. But once you can build cryptocurrencies that track the dollar, euro or whatever, the network effect is more about the value of the token than the platform the token sits on. Bitcoin-based cryptodollars and altcoin-based cryptodollars will be accepted interchangeably because it's easy and beneficial to do so.
If you're ignoring altcoins, you should stop.
