Yes.  Quadriga is much better than CoinSquare as CS’s withholding times are ridiculous.

Well , if I got extra , it would have to come from someone.  Strange.

It’s Canadian.  Quite secure and has a ton of customers.  Verification takes time but I don’t think it works for non Canadians.

That’s all I have.  I could buy more and try again.

I think your right.. I'll keep everyone posted. Just a strange thing to happen so i hope this isn't an indicator of a problem with the actual blockchain....

They do.. Just got a letter stating that there was some processing errors with sending out batch jobs whereby 2x amount was sent.. I think this has happened to quite a few people :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:46:11
Send it and tell me what happens.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:55:48
True. I did notice in Bittrex , there were two pending deposits after I sent the second amount.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:39:28
Ok. Quad confirmed that they had a batch processing error whereby 2x amount was sent out.  They want the money back so no points for being honest......

I laughed reading this on the bus which caused me to fart. Oh the embarrassment.
