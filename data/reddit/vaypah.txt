I was fully aware Bitconnect was a ponzi, but I put in $700 early on and now I'm at a total of $1000 earned. Lets see if it stays up till January when I can withdraw my money...

This guys view is the same view as me really, I only put $3000 into Crypto and now its worth $30000. I won't be too mad if it goes to zero because I can afford to lose it and it is something I really believe in.

I've been in BTC for a while and this "crash" is nothing. $1000 down to $200 scared me, this doesn't.
