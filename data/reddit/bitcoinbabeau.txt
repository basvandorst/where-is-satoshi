I've lodged my complaint with the FOS and ACCC regarding the matter. The fact that they closed my account so quickly when I had pending transfers was very concerning to me. They quoted section 1.9 from their T&amp;C's about the account closure. At the end of which it says:
"The Bank has an obligation under the Code of Banking
Practice to act fairly and reasonably towards you in a
consistent and ethical manner."
In the Code of banking practice under the forced account closure section it states:
"(b) may close an account of yours that is in credit by giving you reasonable notice and paying you the amount of the credit balance;"
The million dollar question is, what is considered reasonable notice? I would assume immediately would not be classed as such... So I'm wondering if I have ground in making BankWest pay for the money that I cannot reclaim from them bouncing the payments.

Any accountant will do it, It's just a matter of sitting down and explaining it to them. Most accountants get scared by the whole "bitcoin" aspect, but if you explain it to them in a way thats similar to stocks, commodities, or real estate, they become more interested.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:10:19
I can tell you know it involves 2 accountants, a solicitor, a surveyor, a real estate, and a butt tonne of paperwork!

Thats the link to the full amendment. I know there is a way to take the bill number (the code at the end of the url) and you can use that to see when they will be discussing it in parliament next, and watch the proceedings either live or previously aired ones.

So I have heard... scary stuff! =S
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:04:45
mid 2013 (I was 20 yrs old at the time), I fell into a pretty bad pit of depression. The sporting season finished so I had sort of lost my hobby, I was in a job I wasnt overly confident in, nor enjoying, my mother had kicked me out of the house because I wasnt getting along with her boyfriend, so I was shacked up with my grandmother who cant speak English well. I was trying to pay off a $12,000 car loan at around 18%pa interest that was breaking twice a week, and this guy I thought I was madly in love with, was seeing other girls behind my back.
I pretty much felt like I had nothing more to offer this world anymore, so figured I would call it quits on my life.
A few months prior I had heard about Bitcoin through a news outlet (they had been reporting on silk road), so figured I would give overdosing a whirl, by buying some pharmaceuticals.
I bought about 10 BTC for around $50 each (I bought a little extra as I wasn't too sure how to accommodate price swings or mining fees), and used it to buy a pack of Stillnox (a sleeping pill) and a few tablets of Oxycontin - I'm allergic to opiates so I knew it didn't take much to put me over the edge. 
Sure enough a few weeks later, the packages arrived. I hopped in my shitty car with a bottle of bourbon, and drove to a national park about 40 minutes out of town, walked into the bush and cried while I downed my pills.
Just as I had finished, my phone manages to find reception and its the "boyfriend" calling. by this point I'm a bit wasted, so start blubbering off at him about god knows what.. probably something a long the lines of how much of a fuck up I was and he'd be glad to know I'll be out of his life for good.. by this point I was going in and out of consciousnesses, and didn't realize he terminated the call a while ago, called emergency services, who managed to track me down and get me out of the bush and rush me to the local hospital.
From what I understand, they pumped my stomach as much as they could, and were about to start trying to flush the opiates out of my system. Until they found out that the "Oxycontin" I had taken was actually aspirin (fucking ripped off), and I wasn't having an allergic reaction, but rather just reacting to the sleeping pills, so I ended up sleeping it off for a few days in the hospital while they monitored me.
Once I was a little more coherent, I was admitted for an emergency psych evaluation, and spent a few more days puttering around the hospital. By this point, they didn't see my mental state as "life threatening" anymore and released me with out-patient care.
When I got out, the "boyfriend" decides we should take a break (I was too much baggage/drama for him) and my employer fired me for not showing up to work. I start seeing the hospital outpatient shrink, who was as useful as a sack of potatoes on a sinking ship, and was struggling to find new employment.
A few months go by, and With minimal money and even less self esteem, I figured hell, at least I know where I fucked up last time, may as well learn from my mistakes. I log back into my account to buy more bitcoin to try again, and sure enough, I had a little under 4 btc left in there.. which were now worth ~$1200 each.
I was so shocked by seeing the number, that I forgot all about why I logged on in the first place, and just sat there for hours and hours, reading about how this happened, why this happened, and figuring out how nearly $5000 had appeared in a broke, depressed girls bitcoin wallet.
From that point my life changed forever.
Shortly after, on my 21st birthday I asked all my family members to give me cash to buy myself more bitcoin. I invested it all into a bitcoin Ponzi/HYIP that was promising "2% daily returns" I got lucky and managed to cash out enough bitcoin to pay off my shitty car loan before it went under. From there I did some day trading (still do here and there), but found my calling in P2P trading.
I managed to trade myself a tidy stockpile of Bitcoin, which I have been hodling for the past few years. 
Looking back on it now, its weird to think that I'm kinda using the same bitcoin I was going to kill myself with, to buy a house with..
Sorry for the long post..

Update: localbitcoins has now disabled the forum
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:28:01
By the looks of things the site itself wasn't hijacked only the forum.. so it may be ok to log in and check your wallet. But I wouldn't run that risk; you generally shouldnt take risky advice from random internet strangers - wait until localbitcoins gives the ok first, THEN enable 2FA!
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:22:21
Not sure at this point but either:
1. They used some sort of script to use the 2FA code entered by the user to withdraw the bitcoin (the log in page was fake, users were still logged in)
2. There have been some reports that people were getting "error" messages when trying to log in, thus re entering a new 2FA code. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:07:25
I'd be more concerned about the bill that regulates it and puts bitcoin under government control. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:15:39
Not really... this "attack" was carried out on the forum users during a quiet time... the figures confirmed thus far would barely make a dent.
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:17:04

TL;DR: security vulnerability found through forum software. Forum disabled. Withdrawals re-enabled. Safe to log in. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:31:22

Government agencies generally get bowled over by the pure mention of bitcoin. Government workers are simple creatures... That's why they work for the government. 
Try lodging again. But just keep it simple. Try to think of it as a cash converters transaction. You went into cash converters to hock off your ex wife's wedding ring. The store clerk gave you a price which you agreed upon and he told you the money would be in your account within 1-2 business days but it never showed. You went back to the cash converters a week later to find out what was going on, but they had since employed a big islander security guard who told you you were banned from coming into the store. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 10:55:34
I posted on this bitcoin talk thread a few years ago regarding the same issue: 
I had a few thousand tied up with them as I recall, and managed to get it all back within a few days.
I'm not sure what rights someone may have as an international customer. But I can certainly tell you the steps I took here as an Australian citizen.
Before you take this path, make sure you tell igot/bitlio what your intentions are... Bank accounts for Bitcoin Traders in Australia are very hard to come by.. and losing one can really fuck you up.. so threatening to go to their bank can work, especially if they don't want the bitcoin ban hammer.
I rang my bank and explained the situation to them - that I had paid money into their bank account in exchange for bitcoin and did not receive it. They were able to open what they call a "Trace and Recall" case for me, which is where they would contact the owner of the account and ask them to return the money to me. 
Fair Trading:
I contacted the Department of Fair Trading (A government department here in Australia than handles disputes between businesses and consumers) and filed a report with them for not receiving what I paid for. Complaints generally dont get assigned for 2-3 weeks so do it sooner rather than later...
This is the link to file a report: 
When they ask you for the details on the business, Make sure you put "13th Pty Ltd Trading as igot.com" or "bitlio" or whatever theyve renamed themselves to now.. (I would probably keep it as igot as that is who you were dealing with at the time) They are registered as 13th pty ltd here in Australia. Fair trading will also ask you for an ABN (Australian Business Number) which is 66160051990. For more information on their Business registration please follow this link: 
Police: 
The final step would be to file a police report. Depending on your residency, I dont think you will be able to file one here in Australia if you are overseas. However if you have any cybercrime units in your country, or a department for international affairs you may want to give them a try. You could also try giving your Australian Consulate a call as they may be able to advise on the situation.
If you are in Australia, make sure when you get the report number from the police, that you pass it onto fair trading and to the bank. It helps substantiate your case.
When I did all this a few years ago, I had Dan from Igot emailing me for days pleading with me to close my cases because the "money had now been sent". I kept them open as long as I could to ensure an investigation was done for the others. 
All the best!

@_date: 2017-06-23 02:55:32
When I first started opening bank accounts back in 2014, I told the banks I was selling "Gaming Credits" for online games such as runescape and habbo hotel. They had no issue.
However it became a problem, when customers who were putting money into my account with references like "Bitcoin" (despite the fact they were explicitly told not to) that the banks eventually caught on.
There was also a theory a few years ago that banks (particularly westpac) were tracking down LocalBitcoins traders via the auto generated references LBC provides customers to use as references on their payments. The reason for this theory was because in the space of a week nearly a dozen traders received closure notices for their Westpac/St George/Bank of Melbourne/BankSA accounts.

This is something that is about to become an issue for me after the 1st of July.
I have to lodge my books with the ATO. My bitcoin transactions can be verified (Blockchain). However I have no documentation to "back up" the fiat data of what I bought and sold for (aka Bank statements) Select banks I held accounts with in the past, are refusing to release my previous account information, transactions etc. for tax purposes, because they believe I'm going to the media with it (mind you, I did a radio interview about it with the ABC a few years ago, so their claims arent baseless)
From what I understand from my accountant, if the ATO decide to audit me next financial year, they will need to subpoena my information from the banks.

@_date: 2017-06-22 11:09:44
It's something that's come up in discussion a few times. But the difficult part is finding a law firm to do it. It would be a few years before any sort of outcome would come from it. Not to mention, a lot of businesses don't see eye to eye on certain issues, or at least how to deal with them, which is a real let down.

I realise this, however assuming guilt without a shred of evedience isnt very ethical. And the number of fraud rings I have found and reported to banks/authorities, without receiving payment, or incuring a loss of funds/bitcoin certainly outweighs the number of times it has been a problem.
Its the banks general lack of effort to investigate these issues and proceed with an account closure and subsequent ban is the real problem here. Especially when this decision is made negligently, and causes someone like me a loss.

This is true (and what I am fearful of). However in regards to the services they offer, in regards to ID verification, their customer base is quite small. Should they start taking on new clients, then I fear my red flag status will ripple.
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:28:43
I've requested for proof via email. Waiting for their response. 
As for going political, it's very much a dead end. You just have to look up the ACCC investigation done a while ago. However I wouldn't mind going legal with it.. issue is trying to find others to come forward. A class action would be the way to go I believe. But a lot of businesses are too scared to come forward in fear of losing their current accounts. And I don't blame them. You only have to take one look at my bank track record to see what going to the media does to you.

I have my own ID verification service that I use. The first thing I did was check myself (before I wreck myself). Happy to report I'm not on any government watch lists, or a Russian politician. In saying That, I am going overseas next month for a holiday. Only time will tell.

Correct. And apparently I dont. 
Most banks now opt you in for digital statements... which get delivered straight to my Internet Banking, which was deactivated when my accounts got closed.

Pre Bitcoin, I used to work for a Solar installation company.. I have a friend who is still in the biz ;)
I wonder if theyll accept bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:50:48
Getting a credit card, mortgage, superannuation account or personal loan is probably something I'll never be able to get.. at least not without great difficulty. There are obviously alternative financial services  out there that offer such things, especially home loans, but most of them are owned by the bigger banks. And the bans do trickle down the stream... 
But Yes, it has certainly opened my eyes to how corrupted the system is. Not only the banks, but the government's that let it happen. And at this point I think it's fair to say I'm past the point of no return. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 00:58:31
The accounts were closed because of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:00:06
I've reached out to the bank that IR use to get an account opened. They said they dont deal with Bitcoin businesses.
Also tried reaching out to the Bpay provider coinjar used, and they also gave me the same response.
I have no issues with POLi, and POLi have no issues with what I do. The issue is, is that payments processed via POLi need to go to a bank account.
There are other services I use like Flexepin which are bitcoin friendly. It works but unfortunately not as popular compared to traditional methods, like bank transfer or cash deposit.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:35:24
Get back in touch with them? or you? =p
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:34:56
How do you mean?
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:54:36
This does not happen "often". In the past 3 years, I've had 4 cases of fraud investigated by banks. It's not like this is a daily or weekly occurrence. And I'm sure if my business was selling computer parts or clothes online, I wouldn't be having my accounts shut down as frequently as what I do now.. or at all for that matter... Not to mention, how many online retailers have you shopped at recently that have asked you for ID verification?
Whether your selling bitcoin or sporting goods online, both have the same risks for chargebacks and both would have to deal with lost stock. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:19:29
That would make crypto perfect for you right?

A customer of mine was accepting Bitcoin as payment for custom built computers he'd make for people. NAB shut his account down.

Banks deliberately make their conditions vague, so they can twist it to conform to situations as per their needs.

In the space of 3 years yes. Technically it's 35 if you include the banks my mum got banned from when she tried to help.

But short answer, they dont provide reasons. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:45:03
Oh yes. If you take a look at the spreadsheet, the Banks under the header "application denied" have not let me apply, or have denied my application to open an account. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:27:06
To be honest, I'll be leaving that with the ATO... hopefully as a government organization they will see how difficult it is to deal with the banks as a bitcoin business..

1pm Update
All banks have now been contacted via email. The email sent to each bank has been attached below. I have also been unsuccessful in contacting the Broken Hill CU.
Hume bank called and said their bank is "not governed" to open Bitcoin accounts.
I also received a call from unity bank (who own Reliance bank and Bankstown city CU) who stated that they "do not have a product that suits my needs."
I am yet to receive anything from a bank in writing.
I have decided to start contacting banks that have either rejected my application in the past, and banks I have been banned from in the past, to at least see if their stance on the matter has changed.
*To whom it may concern,
I am looking for a business transaction + savings account that I could use in conjunction with operating my cryptocurrency service.
I understand that the KYC/AML concerns surrounding such activities is seen as high risk by some governance and compliance departments, however my Company adheres to very strict KYC/AML/CTF requirements from our customers, to help minimize these risks as much as possible. I would be happy to discuss this with your own relevant management to ease any concerns they may have, and hopefully work out an arrangement that can help us both.
The business is registered as a PTY LTD and is registered for GST.
I look forward to your response*
@_date: 2017-06-22 10:59:50
My services are in the same category as them. I'm pretty sure they have the same issues. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:41:45
When I first started, I told banks that I sold "Gaming Credits" for online games and casinos like Habbo Hotel and candy crush (I dont know why those two came to mind during the application process but it just did). One account lasted over a year. The rest, less than 6 months.
Eventually the banks catch on. At one point they were tracking bitcoin traders by the references provided by Localbitcoins. About 2 years ago there was a week where the majority of Bitcoin Traders on LocalBitcoins had their Westpac accounts shut down within a week.
But for the most part, all it takes is for someone to put a reference as "Bitcoin" and your whole cover is blown.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:16:16
Equifax doesn't have a large reach here in Australia. Considering they're only relatively new. There is an institution on that list I had issues with in the past (a badly executed account closure which ended up at FOS). 
The other companies I've never dealt with. 
There's nothing on my credit reports to show I've been the victim of identity theft. There have been no "credit checks" done since 2015. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:57:50
Most of the smaller credit unions dont really have anything like that, as their not used to anything so complex.

@_date: 2017-06-09 05:14:56
This is why its being argued that Banks are acting in an anti-competitive manner. Which in the eyes of the ACCC, is illegal.
But then again, even the ACCC found these claims to be untrue in their own investigation last year: 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:01:34
I know some banks now have a Policy that says operating a Bitcoin business is against their terms of service (despite having nothing in any of the T&amp;C's or PDS's). When NAB shut me down, they flat out told me that it was because I was a bitcoin business and this was against their terms and conditions. Same with BOQ, Suncorp and Bank West.
The thing that annoys me, is that it would be a lot more profitable + cost effective for the banks to work with Bitcoin Businesses as opposed to against them. 
I completely agree, there are some "cowboys" out there who play fast and reckless - not doing their due diligence, which sucks because it lets one bad apple spoil the bunch.
I spent a few thousand dollars on being able to comply with KYC/AML standards at a banking level. I dont see why my business practices can be treated with a bit of respect.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:15:28
My account that was recently shut down was MJ T/A Bitcoin Babe (Opened the account before I switched to PTY LTD). The account I currently have open is Bitcoin Babe PTY LTD, which is with Auswide.
The issue with trading under a "non suspicious" trading name, is that it will open you up to more scams. Especially Man In The Middle type ones, where people assume your identity online and sell fake iphones on gumtree, and ask people to deposit into "their" bank account so they can post it out to you - This happened a few years ago, but instead of an iphone, this woman redrew $10,000 on her mortgage, thinking she was buying a caravan. Thankfully I was able to pick up what was going on, and had the money returned to her, without losing any bitcoin - or my bank account for that matter.

If you find the answer to that question let me know.
Banks that have released statements about the issue say its to do with KYC/AML issues - That you cannot prove who a customer is and what their intention is with the Bitcoin.
But in my opinion, this is just a smoke screen to hide the fact that they are fearful of the competition.
If you purchase Bitcoin from any vetted Bitcoin exchange/trader, you need to go through a arduous process of ID verification - I know the ID checks I conduct for my customers are more strenuous than what most banks here do to verify their customers. 
As for wanting to know "where the bitcoin goes" I think thats a bit of a ridiculous ask. When you withdraw money from an ATM, the ATM doesnt ask you "Why do you need this money?" its a classic case of privacy violation. So why should we do the same for customers who wish to purchase Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:48:02
Thats what I'm thinking. I have notified my lawyer of the issue, and I'm hoping their firm will come back to me about a plan of attack.
Unfortunately FOS cant do anything in regards to the intervention of closing down Bitcoin businesses bank accounts. You can read any T&amp;C documentation from any bank, and all of them will say, they have the right to close your account at any time for any reason and they dont have to tell you why. Thanks to this little clause, I was banned from my 27th Bank just last week.
The issue really lies with the ACCC. They are the ones who have the power to investigate anti competitive behaviour.

Update 12pm
Started emailing banks as apposed to calling them, mainly so I can get my message across, and to stop any miscommunication from misinformed call centre staff.
Manly warringah credit union had an online application process which I completed. It is now undergoing review. I didn't actually talk to anyone regarding their stance on Bitcoin businesses. It kinda feels like cheating in a way...
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:08:29
In the past 3 years, I've had 6 disputes - five involving banks and one involving paypal. The most recent one is currently being fought out with the FOS so cant comment much on that. The one before that was over 12 months ago, which I fought and won.
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:09:18
Got a call from Newcastle Perm. I need to call them back tomorrow to discuss the matter with their compliance department.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:43:53
CBA did that with me once.. but I was trying to do a SWIFT payment to Bitfinex a few years ago. CBA refused to process the payment.
Recently there was a video on the front page about a kid at his high school graduation who was giving his speech about how the administration at his school showed poor leadership skills and they cut his mic off.. by doing that they proved the kids point.
Banks refusing to process a payment for the purpose of buying bitcoin is really no different.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:30:49
I've had customers encounter the same issues. Especially ones who purchase frequently.
I also know of a few forex businesses who have lost their accounts. And they have nothing to do with Bitcoin.. I think it was BM forex or something that recently had their ANZ account shut down.
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:22:17
I knew Banks incured costs when a FOS dispute was opened  but I didn't realise it was like that. Thanks for the insight.

Quick update with this,
The mutual (Maitland mutual building society) have passed my enquiry onto their compliance department and should be in touch within the next day or so.

Yes ideas like that have been floating around the rumour mill for a quite a while. Theres obviously no hesitation when it comes to the technology surrounding Bitcoin, considering the banks openness about their intentions of developing their own blockchain technology.
It is clear that the banks are engaging in anti-competitive behaviour but are using AML/CTF as a smokescreen so that they don’t have to disclose their reasons for closing accounts of bitcoin traders.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:24:07
