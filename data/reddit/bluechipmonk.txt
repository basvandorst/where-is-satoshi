And they on purpose don’t allow payouts below 0.1 because it’s smaller amount and they hope people forget it. They are smart fuckers.

What if you sell weed in Colorado legally and youre not allowed to have a business bank account. It's not safe to carry around all that cash. Having bitcoin makes things easy for such cases.

Third party service. AWS probably also wouldn't try to protect its customers data because if they have an order from a judge they cant do nothing but follow it, and AWS would comply because they dont want their brand damaged by media "oh hey look Amazon was helping russian hackers to steal millions of dollars from americans blah blah"

Yea I'm also curious why US is involved in arresting a Russian citizens (or maybe they are US citizens) or have done something in US. 
It's super annoying to see US getting involved in everything.

Stripe is such a huge hypocrite. They accept bitcoin payments themselves.

This is pretty bad. It means they would have the power to shut down exchanges and it would make it very hard to exchange bitcoins to USD or some other currency.
