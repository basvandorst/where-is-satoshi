You know what would be cool though. If Rootstock(RSK) comes to fruition, each company could take x amount of Bitcoin and convert it to their own company coin. Then they pay their employees with it and even some business bills. And businesses will basically have company advertising on the money you spend.

Right? The price should only go down if they end up on an exchange and the selling pressure drives the price down.  Transferring it from one wallet to another shouldn't make the price go down.

the price is completely irrelevant to Bitcoin. He took a lot of Bitcoins OUT of circulation and placed them in a vault. Then instead of issuing out the Bitcoins to buyers, he issued them IOU's which are redeemable for USD, not Bitcoin. He got enough people to buy his limited supply of paper Bitcoins which drove up the price.  Its possible for GBTC to go up even wayyyy higher than Bitcoin or to go way below Bitcoin.  Only Barry controls those Bitcoins.

I think it would be a cool feature that if one could prove a bitcoin was stolen, it could be tagged.  and now when they send that bitcoin to other account, right before it arrives a warning could pop up: "Warning - this is a stolen coin, Either Deny the transaction or accept it and send it to the following address..."
And as soon as it reaches its original address the warning system would dissolve off the coin and it can be spent regularly. Like as if passed through a filter. 
The problem is how could one prove the coin was truly stolen?

Thank you for the financial advice.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:17:29
lol, dont be so small minded. 
I am American and the world does revolve around us. Look, you are talking to an American, on an American Website in American English. Bitcoin is an American invention based on American Technology. God damn I love Murica and Trump. Thats not even a joke. 
But Not everyone in the gov't is crooked. There are patriots within our gov't that have formed secret societies in order to fight evil secret societies within our gov't and to fight foreign secret societies trying to subvert our Gov't and Country. 
They have been infiltrating and watching the banksters(Federal Reserve and Central Banking) and secretly plotting to take them out, but they have to do it in a way that wont kill hundreds of millions of people if the financial system suddenly collapsed. Which it is collapsing. 
Bitcoin and open source Crypto Coins are their way of freeing us from the Banksters and giving us our financial freedom to do free trade again. Just what America was meant to be. 
No private organization can pull of this feat. And the American Gov't has truly been pretty fucking generous to Bitcoin and Cryptos. A couple recent laws being passed right now like the one about every trade is a tax event. This is 2 faced. Its an empty threat that they wont enforce but can use against you if you get all uppity, but its also legitimization. They don't need to legalize it when its considered Legitimate and they are taxing it. It makes the gov't look like a big meanie, but its pushing it forward without promoting it. Cuz if the gov't came out tomorrow and told everyone to buy it as soon as possible, all the wrong people would probably buy it up and the American people wouldn't have a fair chance at getting some. which Bitcoin was meant for. We are simply sharing our technology with everyone else. Chip into the pool on your way in. 
Hell, I'm halfway thinking the Wall Street Pump to $19k and Dump to $10k was their way of trying to signal to the masses, "Yo! This is what will happen to the price if you guys all buy into it. We just lowered the price back down so you can buy it up cheap. Hurry and get on board before the Chinese start buying it up again, they are almost ready with their regulations"
This is a massive Psyop. Biggest in Human History!

@_date: 2018-01-20 02:36:33
in 1999 the tech boom started declining and popping. by 2000, close to 2 trillion dollars were wiped out. Then in 2001 Saddam huiesan said he would stop selling oil in USD and only accept Euro. Knowing this would help hurt America. Then 9/11 happened and Saddam was shortly taken care of. Even though the hijackers were saudi. funny how that stuff happens. and it recovered up til 2008 when the mortgage bubble popped. More war, mostly with drones, and we have recovered and gone to all time highs in the stock market. 
This recovery is unsustainable and everyone knows it. So we are keeping N. Korea on a tight leash incase the market crashes again. Keep launching those missiles Kim, you are playing into the military industrial complex's hands
I think Kim knows he is next on the hit list and is posturing like, dont mess with me, I got nukes.

Its all within context. If these futures purchasers were simply gambling and placing their bets on futures. It would have no effect on Bitcoin other than possibly psychological one on buyers. 
But with the Futures announcement in November, Future Shorters bought up Bitcoin just to dump it as the contracts expired. 
But now they can't dump it, cuz they already did. But they can go long and buy the hell out of it. So now they either wait for the public to buy it up and if we don't they will when the contracts come close to expiring. And they win again. 
Then I expect a bunch of shorting on the next cycle.  But with Each Cycle, the price of Bitcoin should get pumped more and more. Before November, it was at around $3k. Now after the pump and dump from wall street, the floor seems to be around $10k-$11k. I expect the next wall street pump to go to $30k-$40k

This is how I calculate retirement needs. I'm 36 and lets say I live to the rip old age of 100. Who knows, I might live to 120 with the right medicine.
But if i live to 100, then I have 768 more months on this planet. How much money do I need each month? $3000 seems like a good monthly budget. $3k x 768 = $2.3M. 2.3M dollars to retire today.
So I need 2.3 Bitcoins and hope they go to $1 Million dollars each. And honestly, I think they will hit a million dollars each. 
And the longer it takes me to get to this goal, the less of it I need, or I can at least spend a little more for a few months.
@_date: 2019-07-18 05:25:26
while you are right, its only that cheap if nothing ever goes wrong and nothing ever needs fixed. 
A nice benefit for renters is they can do month to month and leave when they want. Its a bit harder for a home owner. And if anything breaks, the renter just calls the land lord.  I remember when the roof leaked the last time it rained...

Retard leftist would never buy Bitcoin if Trump said he loved it. Leftist are that easily manipulated.

A bunch of Weak ass answers in here. 
Bakkt is bring Bitcoin to the Average American's 401k account. So is Fidelity.
Wall Street is going to flood into this market. Master Card owns the Digital Currency Group, or at least donates a lot to it. And that money goes to lightning Labs which is developing the Lighting Network.  And look at all those other Crypto businesses in the Portfolio. Goldman Sachs bought Poloniex. Nasdaq is going to launch a trading desk. 
We are about to see massive influx of institutional wealth. Then when Bitcoin is $100k, They will open up to mom and pop americans to buy, this will layer money ontop of all the earlier guys and lock in their profits.  Then to give mom and pop profit, Bakkt and everyone will start putting Bitcoin in peoples retirement funds. Then ad campaigns will be ran: help your grand parents retire early; Buy Bitcoin! Then Gov'ts will be told by Wall Street, "You need to have Bitcoin and Litecoin and Ethereum as Strategic Assets. Put $10 Billion into each." And Gov'ts will all rush to out Crypto each other. 
Its only a matter of time now. $1 Million dollar Bitcoin within 5-10 years. My optimistic guess is $20k by the end of this month, and $100k by the end of the year.

"Its not easy to buy things with Bitcoin"
In America, its not easy to buy things with Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Mexican Pesos, Canadian Pesos, the Euro... I could go on. 
Its easy to pay with Bitcoin if the merchant wants to accept it. Just like all those other currencies listed above.
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:26:09
OP was making a statement at how large the market dominance of Bitcoin is. Bitcoin alone, is 65% of all cryptos combined. 
Roger Ver used to say look at Bitcoins Dominance of 25% or whatever it fell too. Roger argued Bitcoin failed because it lost so much Dominance in the Market. And his bcash coin wouldn't lose so much dominance because it had giant blocks. 
And now Bitcoin is back up to impressive dominance of the Market.   And it still only has 1MB blocks. So Roger needs to stop promoting his scam coin. He needs to rebrand it and make it his VerCoin or something. Quit telling people its the "Real Bitcoin". Because its not.
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:05:36
Well its awesome that you realize this and aren't stuck in a 'this is good enough' mode.
I think there are two good ways to safely store your cryptos. 
First is a Ledger Nano S or X. The S is probably just fine for 96% of people. Its what I have. Write down the pass words that it provides, and never type that password into any computer ever. It comes with nice heavy cards to write on. 
2nd best way is to get an old Android cell phone or go buy a new cheap one. I recommend one with a removable battery. No need for a sim card. turn on wifi and download the coinomi wallet and turn the wifi back off. Always keep wifi off. with no connectivity to any kind of internet, open the coinomi wallet and create a new wallet.  Again, write this down and never input it into any computer ever. 
Now you can use your old phone as a hardware wallet that is disconnected from the internet. And when its off, yank the battery out so the NSA can't remotely turn it on and gank your coins. And make sure to put a really long password on your coinomi wallet. That way if your phone gets stolen, they wont be able to transfer funds out of the wallet on the phone.
But remember, if you lose your Ledger, your phone AND your pass words you lose all your money. 
The one saving grace of leaving money on Coinbase is that since its an American Company, even if they got hacked and you lost money from your account, you would probably get it back from them. Binance was recently hacked and it collected a charge on all trades that went to a "we got robbed" fund. So when they got hacked, they were able to restore all the customer accounts to full.

I remember in early 2013 my friend told me he had .80 of a Bitcoin and he was going to buy shrooms on the silk road. I thought.. "heh, cool..." and never thought about bitcoin again until around Halloween of 2013. Jon Stewart on the Daily Show(when it was funny) did a segment on Bitcoin. 
Thats when I perked up and thought, "what is this thing? My buddy isn't tech savvy and he knows more than I do. Let me look into it." and thats when I did a deep dive into it. 
Also luckily, I had just recently watched Bill Still's money masters and the secret of oz documentarys. So I was ripe with knowledge on how money was working against us.

All Trump said was he was not a fan. He did not say he hated it. 
Secondly, Trump is going after the Federal Reserve right now. THEY control the US dollar supposedly.  I'm expecting Trump to Nationalize the Federal Reserve and abolish the IRS. I have no idea what the central bankers of Europe will do to America if Trump does this. But, I definitely want to be holding Bitcoin over any other kind of money. 
Trump is literally playing everyone right now. Do you know how many Bitcoin Businesses are about to open on Wall Street this month and all through out the year? A LOT. BIG BIG Players. Everyone from Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq, Greyscale, Bakkt, Starbucks, Mastercard, VISA, Microsoft, Fidelity, and so many others. &lt;-- They are ALL doing mostly Bitcoin stuff. And Trump likes to boast about his Wall Street Stock Market Numbers. Trump is a New York man. 
Congress has been pretty quiet for the most part for the last 10 years on Bitcoin. But as soon as Libra shows up; CEASE AND DESIST! Bitcoin still has a pass though. 
I really feel in my gut that Trump is trying to use reverse psychology on leftist to save them. If he said he was a fan, BUT... and all the same stuff. Liberals would be having a shit fit and spreading misinformation about bitcoin. But now, they are going to buy it just to teach him a lesson. Just in time for Bakkt to Launch in a few days.

Well, if the flood the market with Bitcoin to lower it's price, little guys like me are just gonna buy it up, driving the price up. 
If they want to sink the price a second time, it will cost them a lot more the second time they buy bitcoin. 
So they may have bought a lot of Bitcoin at $3k, but now those same bitcoins are worth $10k-$11k
The third time buying bitcoins to short, bitcoins will probably be at $30k each.

again, business can be set up AROUND bitcoin. But Bitcoin is Bitcoin and these businesses are not part of the core protocol.

Bcash was created because segwit disabled bitmains asic boost.

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:24:36
It allows it to be more programmable. Like adding Atomic Swaps and Lightning Network. BCH can not do this without Segwit. 
Bcash just added bigger blocks and put a band aid on major wound. Bigger blocks is a temporary solution, not a solution. While I agree that Bitcoin should have added bigger blocks with Segwit to releive the problem of high fees and long confirmation times, the real solution comes with second layer. And Segwit allows for 2nd layers. 
But Segwit also cancelled out Asic Boost which Bitmain holds control of. 
Thats why they created Bcash.
thats how I feel about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:11
Bcash was created to help bitmain sell miners after segwit made asic boost obsolete. Roger ver is just a Chinese cuck

@_date: 2018-09-21 00:46:02
No you are wrong. Bitcoins can't leave the Bitcoin network and jump onto the Lightning Network. This is how we know there wont be more than 21 Million Bitcoins. 
What happens is, you put your Bitcoin in a smart contract address, and the smart contract generates Lightning tokens in the exact amount of Bitcoin inserted. Then you use those tokens on the lightning network. Each one represents bitcoin locked in escrow. 
Then when you remove/settle your Bitcoins from the lightning address, the Lightning tokens in your possession go away. 
This is an over simplified version of what happens. 
And other Coins like Litecoin and Digibyte are going to be able to go onto the Lightning Network and all these coins are can intermingle. Its going to be amazing when the world starts using this Technology. I'm pretty excited about the next 10 years. I think we are going to see unprecedented prosperity. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:23:27

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:10:55
you are right to a degree. Blockchain is not the end all be all money AND currency.  Any blockchain currency will reach high fees and slow times when it reaches the daily volume success that Bitcoin has. Even the mighty Ethereum is getting clogged up with crypto kitties. 
The Solution is 2nd layer protocols. And that is what the Lightning Network is. another solution to scaling is Atomic swaps. When the network is too congested, Atomic Swap to another less congested network and use that one. then the Payee can swap back or keep the coin you sent. 
HashGraph looks like a wonderful solution, but its not open source or public. Its a private ledger. 
The true value of Bitcoin is locked up in its Finite Supply, Cryptographic Security and the ability to transfer value to anyone over the internet with no third party permission. Its worth a hell of a lot more than $19k and will always be worth something, even if daily transactions are used on a different technology.

I totally understand this. It concerns me minimally but it does concern me. 
Here is the deal, not everyone wants to use Bitcoin and thats ok. There is enough wealth on this planet for 1000 very strong Cryptos. New coins will be made for certain purposes. If I want super fast transactions for a fraction of the fee, I will eventually be able to atomic swap my Bitcoin into Digibytes. 
There wont be A One World Currency. There will be hundreds and if not, thousands. 
Bitcoins "useability" issues will be fixed over time. And since there are only 21 million of them, they will be seen as very valuable for a very long time to come.

The lower price of Litecoin is a psychological trigger that will make people want to park their wealth into it. in my opinion. No one can afford a $20k Bitcoin, but a lot of people can afford a $100 Litecoin. (yeah yeah yeah, i know bitcoin can be bought in fractions.)

So its useful cuz its the middleman for all banks basically. And its free and easy to use. There is just a 2 day delay cuz... banks. I can't send money to a wells fargo or BoA or any other bank from my credit union's app or desktop website.

cause honestly, I love Bitcoin. I hope it reaches $100k per share. 
But I haven't bought bitcoin in... i dont know how long. I buy Litecoin now. In my mind, I see Litecoin going to $12k in the next 5 years and those returns from $70-$90 versus Bitcoins $7k to $100k are much more lucrative. 
Lets do the math. 1 Bitcoin at $7k to $100k is a gain of $93k dollars. Wow! Thats awesome. 
Now to be fair, we need $7k worth of Litecoin for the experiment to be fair. $7k divided by $80/Litecoin is 87.5 Litecoins. Now if Litecoin goes to 12k. (12k * 87.5) = $1,050,000 Would you rather a $93k gain or a $1M gain? 
Where did I come up with with $12k Litecoin? well, I honestly believe its only a matter of time, until the top 20-30 Cryptocurrencies all have a $1 Trillion dollar market cap each. And I think some cryptos like Bitcoin will have multiple Trillions eventually. (5-10 years) So a $12k Litecoin will have roughly a $1 Trillion dollar market cap.  But a 100k Bitcoin will need a staggering 2.1T market cap. 
So if you want to be a millionaire in the next 5-10 years and you think Litecoin can hit a $1T market cap, put $7k into Litecoin.  or if you think Bitcoin can hit $1T market cap, you will need to put $148k into Bitcoin.

Its not useless at all. Venmo is the Bitcoin of the Fiat World. 
I download the app, link my bank account to it, and now I can send funds digitally from my bank account to my friends or anyone else for FREE. 
How is that useless? The way Venmo makes its money right now is through investors. Investors dump 10's of millions into it and when some schmuck company wants to buy it, the creators and investors of Venmo get friggen rich and now its up to the company who bought it to figure out how to monetize it.  thats when the fees come. 
So until then, its a great app to use if you need to send or receive money digitally from friends and family or whoever.

I had my ledger nano s in my carry on. It went through the scanner and tsa agent, a plump hispanic lady, started digging through my bag. She said it had been randomly selected as she looked me up and down. -__-
She pulled out the Ledger and started flipping it like it was a switch blade or something. and she asked me, "what's this for?"    
I told her "it's just a password hard drive. no big deal."
Her: "I don't believe you." she then whistled to a couple guys about 20 feet behind me and told them to come over. 
While she was looking at them trying to make eye contact, I grabbed it out of her pudgy little hands and made a run for it to my Terminal. I was already running late so most of the people had already boarded. There were ladies standing there knowing they shouldn't let this mad man running towards them with gaurds chasing him to get on this plane. They tried to stop me but I just bashed right on through them. 
I got onto the plane and ran into the cock pit and shouted to the pilot TO TAKE OFF NOW!!!!  I ran back to the airplane door and one of the guards had crossed the threshold, but I front kicked him backwards and he knocked a few guys down behind him. By then the plane was pulling forward and we broke off from the terminal. As we ascended I looked out the airplane door and saluted them and then shut the door. It was pretty crazy and I lost some luggage, but I got back to America from Chicago.

You never posted any facts. 
Fact: ISIS has 700 Perfect Passports to export terrorism. 
Trump wants a moratorium on Muslim Immigration until we can figure out a way to do background checks on the people coming over as refugees to make sure they aren't Terrorist, like what happened in  France.
Fact: Guns, Drugs and Human traffiking is happening on a daily basis across the US/Mexico border. A wall will help curb the inflow and make patrolling easier. 
FACT: Muslims and Immigrants Are not a single race. Therefore its not Racist.

I see what you are saying. And in your analogy, the gold on mars would equate to unmined Bitcoins. 
Remember there are only 15.6million in circulation. And some of those 15.6million are lost. But since they have been mined, they are accounted for. We know exactly where they are. They are simply dormant and off the market. Not for sale. 
So the market cap does account for lost coins, they are just dormant/not going on the market for sale.

Its an assumption on my part. But the transaction didn't clear for at least a day. Then later in the story(about 13:30 minutes into it) they mention "one way to skip to the head of the transaction processing que is to add a Fee". Which to me implies they did not add that fee on their $5 transaction. I think its an omission of fact. 
They also pretty much blamed a DDOS attack on an area, on Bitcoin. At least that is the way it comes off. Basically implying if it wasn't for Bitcoin and the XT protocol, the attack never would have happened. Which is sort of true, but really its just an asshole DDOS attacker. 
Then they ask Mike Hearn if bitcoin is dying. Mike does a long pause and a sigh. And says, its not dead, but its not interesting. Therefore implying death is to come via stagnation. Like, since there was no more interest in myspace, therefore its still there, but its pretty much dead. 
So much FUD. If anything, its going to keep normies out of Bitcoin for longer and those of us in it, will be able to collect more for cheaper.

I didn't say it was succeeding. But if you look at the 6 month and 1 year charts it is doing better than last year. 
But the reason it isn't fizzling out like you predicted would happen to BCH is because its worth SOMETHING. Might not be a lot, but money is money. 
And if Dogecoin (which is worth a 1/10th of a cent) can pay for things like this:
Then Bitcoin Cash will be worth mining. Especially to ASIC Boost Mining Hardware. 
Don't worry though. There is plenty of wealth.

Doesn't matter if its greed driving part of the market. Yeah some will make quick minor gains and leave. Not a huge deal. But for every one of those, another greedy person will buy into the peak, crash and become a bag holder. 
But being a bag holder creates patience. Probably anxiety for a while. But eventually as long as you didn't truly need that money soon. I believe people who stick around long enough eventually get it. And understand the long game.
Those who get out and think they are so smart for making a quick 200-300-400 dollars are gonna feel really dumb in a few years in supply dwindles down and the price goes up. 
I was just talking to a friend who said he bought some bitcoin at $90(he only wanted it to buy drugs on the silk road) per Bitcoin back in the day. Now he has finally realized what I've been saying these last couple years.  Some people really have a hard time connecting the dots and seeing future trends. Like they just dont get it. Until the price skyrockets and they go. Ohhhhh... if I had one bitcoin that I paid $600 for. and now its $4k. Now I have $4k. Me like that.  lol. 
And the only reason why people buy Silver and gold is the same thing. They know(feel) that it will be worth more in the future because its a finite substance. But speculation is not a bad thing when it comes to cryptos. Its very different to speculate on a stock connected to a business. Because what if that business fails to deliver said product. Then the whole company is built on gambling money and not income revenue. And then the company could lose all its money and go under. Bitcoin as money shouldn't collapse as long as its valuable for miners to mine it. And thats what the transaction fees are for once bitcoin gets mined completely out in 100 years.  
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:44:55
Dont listen to these fools. Just buy it now. Supply and Demand. Only 21 Million Bitcoins and potentially unlimited buyers with really unlimited wealth. 
It will go up and down, but in the long run, its going to go way up. I'll eat my own dick if it doesn't. I've been telling my coworker about this since it was $400 each, and he just got into today. 
Just put the $5k in and don't think about touching it unless you really really really need it. 
But honestly. I would think about half and half with Bitcoin and Litecoin. These are the two top dogs of Storage of Wealth.

It does hinder the growth of Bitcoin. Because instead of buying Bitcoin off the market, the rich businessmen who are dumping 10's of thousands to hundreds of thousands are buying paper bitcoin at GBTC. Which is why the price is up so much.
But I realize there is so much wealth in the world, there is enough space for 100 major cryptos. 
I dont own GBTC, I own Regular Bitcoin. Look up the fees for GBTC to get a clearer idea on what they pay to store their bitcoin at GBTC.

Thats great for you. You are your own bank. But you dont have your bitcoins insured incase you get hacked or lose them or perhaps your house gets flooded and destroys your PC and all the paper back ups. 
People who own GBTC do. Also, they have made a lot more money with their Grayscale Bitcoin than you have on your traditional Bitcoin investment. 
GBTC is a good product. Even if it slightly hinders the growth of Bitcoin as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:24:58
like I said. If they do the short sell for immediate gratification, i believe they are short sighted. 
If they reenter. then great. But I know a lot wont. They saw it go up. Then go down. bought. Watched it go up. Sold. And watched it go back down. 
Then they wash their hands of it and never think of it again. I had a friend who bought a bunch of litecoin in 2013. And sold it near the $40 mark back then. Used that money for a down payment on a house. He did great. But he never got back into it. 
He was short sighted. It went back down to $1-$2. and now its back in the $50 range. He is currently in debt still.

people said the same thing about bitcoin at $500 when they were only 20 cents each. I mean, I could see someone paying $1 for a whole bitcoin maybe, but not $200 per bitcoin and especially not $500. 
When Bitcoin is worth $100,000 each, it will because it has matured and it will have a lot of wealth backed into it.

GBTC is a completely different thing though. 
GBTC isn't a company that sells people Bitcoin. 
Its a company that has X amount of Bitcoins and sells of a percentage of its holdings to customer, but they never actually receive the bitcoins. Its a walled garden. Bitcoin NEVER leaves or enters their Financial institution. That is why they currently sell their Bitcoin shares for $9,270 When Regular Bitcoin is going for $4600
Its like having a vault full of gold and only being able to sell what is in the vault. But handing out paper instead of the gold when its sold.
The money is perfectly safe in GBTC. And if it isn't, don't worry because its insured and regulated.

This IS the actual all time high. The all time high really should be measured by the market cap. Not the price of Bitcoin. 
Because the last time Bitcoin reached this high, there were much fewer bitcoins in existence. 25 were being produced every ten minutes until the recent halvening. 
The last time Bitcoin was 1100 dollars, I think the Market Cap was roughly $13 Billion(someone should fact check this) and its currently at $18 Billion because there are a lot more coins in circulation now.

\ is false though. You can buy anything directly with Bitcoin. Simply as long as the other person accepts it.
What I find funny is how he defends accepting bitcoin for gold, he says, "look im not accepting Bitcoin. I use Bitpay so people can send their bitcoins. Bitpay converts it to dollars and then I get those for the gold. My web page accepts Bitcoin, but I'm not actually accepting Bitcoin. 
Check out my Gold Card. See how awesome this is. I can spend my gold ANYWHERE!!!
Little does Peter Shit realize(he is dishonest, maybe he does realize) he isn't paying anyone with Gold. That debit card takes his gold and converts it to dollars and gives dollars to the merchant. Not gold. JUST LIKE BITPAY. lol
I don't think he is dumb, just a sleazy gold merchant skimming off the top.

I say this. Any Bitcoin under $10k is a deal. Here is my reasoning. 
Amazon.com has a marketcap of 363 Billion dollary-doos. 
Gold Has a market cap of $6,759,543,320,170 (Trillions)
I find it very plausible that Bitcoin can reach a $300 Billion dollar cap in the next 10 years. 
$300B/21M(coins) = $14,285.00 Per Bitcoin. 
Even when Bitcoin is at $5000/bitcoin, a $1500 Bitcoin will be profitable and worth it.

I dont know the technicals of it just yet, but i would assume so. Insert a buck and open a channel. Now you have a channel with $1 in it. Now anyone on the LN can send money to your LN Wallet. And then to move those to onchain Bitcoin blockchain, close the LN channel. And it gets confirmed in the next block. 
Thats how I imagine it working.

Wall Street has chosen Bitcoin &amp; Litecoin to put its money into. They tested the network in Q4 and clogged it up. They pulled back and are now waiting until they can fully use the Lightning Network. They use the LN, we the people can use on chain. And if enough people on the planet use Bitcoin to clog it up, the people can use the LN for easy and cheap payments. Bitcoin is a million times easier to use today than in 2009. The Lightning Network is the solution.

Because it's not a stock based on the performance of a company. 
If I introduce a brand new company, let's call it blackberry, And we announce that we are gonna create a new product called a smart phone and trust us, EVERYONE will want one when we release it. 
Speculators will buy up the stock and create an over valued "bubble". 
But if another company comes along, let's call them apple, and makes a better smart phone. Then we as blackberry have failed to deliver the revenue that would make our stock price relevant and one can expect a crash or correction in the price of said stock.
Bitcoin isn't promising a product. Just itself. And it does what it says it does. You are just witnessing price discovery as the limited supply is now dwindling as more people are holding than selling.

lack of use doesn't whither the value away of an asset like this. With an inflationary currency, you are correct. 
Look at gold, the value stays relevant stable and high. And no one ever uses it as a money. No one accepts it as tender. 
Its my honest opinion, we don't need Vendor Adoption first, we just need consumer adoption. When we have enough Consumer Adoption, then vendors will naturally accept it. Especially as they see it grow in value in a consistent way up.

ledger is really simple. When you boot it up, it will ask you to create a PIN and then it will generate your wallet for you. All you got to do is write down those words on the paper that comes with it. 
Then take that new computer you bought and download the ledger software onto it. Really simple. 
Now to view the balance, all you do is open the ledger app on the computer. It will be password protected. 
If you want to send money from your wallet, you will then need to plug the ledger to the computer and enter your pin. 
Its about as simple as can be. 
Or buy a new smartphone and download the coinomi wallet. Dont put a SIM in it and keep the phone off of Wifi. Then create a new Coinomi walllet and put a password on it. And you are set. But, the ledger is a little more secure.

nope. GBTC price does not flow up and down with regular bitcoin price. 
The are like a walled exchange. Their price is derived from their customer base, not the world price of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin could drop to zero and if none of GBTC customers sold. the price would stay the same.

In my Opinion: Its so much more of a hassle to spend Bitcoin or any other crypto. I barely see Bitcoin accepted anywhere. The last time I did, It was at one of these, "make a small pizza for $8" fast food joints. My experience went like this(and I'm not exaggerating):
I walk up and asked if they accepted Bitcoin and she was like, "actually, we do". Then she had to go get a tablet that she never hardly used. Then she was having problems accessing the wallet and I was getting conscious of all the people behind me. So I told her never mind would just pay the regular way with my card. 
But if it did go through, I would still need to type out my long password that protects my phone wallet and then I would later have to log into coinbase and buy back the 0.001 Bitcoin I spent.
While its cool and a lot more convenient for purchasing stuff over the internet rather than in person. Its just not worth the hassle when I can let it sit and appreciate until I can buy an expensive luxury item, like a car or a house. 
with that said, I don't live in a shit hole country.

The Chinese will search for and find some out of business American company. Then they buy it, then merge with it and change the name and get it listed. 
Its an American company, but completely controlled by the Chinese, and they get it on the Stock Market because they push lots of money through it. THEN, since its on the stock market, they start throwing parties for investors here in America and hire celebrities.  And everyone gets super pumped. And Money managers tell their clients to get in on this, and the Chinese just end up Cashing out and staying in China.
And there is nothing no one can do. Our police stop at the ocean. And China doesn't care. Ripping off Americans is a National past time for them.

Bitcoin is simply a database ledger keeping track of a very limited supply of movable tokens. 
Backed and secured by Math and Cryptology. 
As fewer and fewer of these tokens become available on the exchanges, the price goes up. Simple Supply and Demand Economics. 
Everything in China is valued in Chinese Fiat. Gold is valued in Fiat. Of course Bitcoin is going to be valued in Fiat. What else is a better way of weighting the value of something?  
One of the Intrinsic values of Bitcoin is to send money peer to peer with no 3rd party permission. Its basically Torrenting Money. What Torrenting did for Movies and Music, it will do the same for money.

First they promise them good money if they come. So they come. Then They take their maids/servants Visas away from them and now they cant leave. Then they pay them very very little. Its Slavery. Farmers in the South paid their slaves and gave them room and board as well. What is the difference. 
Maids are like Pokemon to the KSA. Catch and trade. 
Oh and the context is, promise a full wage, execute the contract and then find a way to prevent your servant from signing it within a certain time period, get your money back. They will claim the servant didn't fulfill their side of the contract by signing it in a timely period.

I have an image in my head of two large graduated cylinders. One labeled USD and the other labeled crypto.  As one fills up, the other lowers. And the price changes to reflect the ratio of one to the other.
When the Crypto cylinder is full of crypto, the Price of crypto will be low.  because there is a TON of crypto. The market is Saturated with Crypto.
But when the USD cylinder is full, Its because people are buying the crap out of crypto and the Crypto cylinder is low and the price of crypto becomes high. Because there isn't enough crypto to pass around. It has to start being divided. 
So it seems to me, people are buying a ton of crypto and filling the exchanges to the brim with crypto(getting these cryptos from miners OTC), thus lowering the price. The powers that be, want to make sure the public can get their hands on a ton of Crypto as demand starts to rise. This will make it so the price doesn't skyrocket over night. 
Bakkt and other companies are about to offer Crypto to the public. And the public will start heading to these exchanges to buy Bitcoin and others. Bitcoin being the main crypto.

@_date: 2018-11-28 11:16:09
The importance is that Bitcoin is a Fixed supply. There will never be more than 21M bitcoin.
The entire planet has to share this very limited supply of coins. I'm in California, there are roughly 40M humans here. That means there is only enough Bitcoin for each of us to have 1/2 of a Bitcoin. 
then what if the other 350M people in the USA want some Bitcoin? Then there is another 750M people in Europe. Another 125M in Mexico. A Billion people in China, A billion People in India. Africa. The Middle East. All of Asia. South America. Russia. There is just not enough whole Bitcoins to go around. Therefore the price of Bitcoin has to go up and up and up as more and more people want it as a means of trade. 
Luckily, Bitcoins are highly divisable. 100M each. So although there are 21M bitcoins, there are 2.1 Quadrillion units of trade. Enough for everyone. But as more and more people drive value into Bitcoin by converted economic energy into it. The price will rise exponentially. 
So to own 1 Bitcoin is a very valuable thing that not everyone can do. 
And now, Bakkt and Fidelity want to put Bitcoin into everyones retirement funds. Bitcoin is about to get VERY SCARCE. And to have even 1 is going to be extremely valuable. And as of right now, 99.5% of the planet has no Bitcoin at all.

I have a gut feeling this stability is manufactured. Like the ETF big boys need a stable market before the SEC will clear their ETF to go live. So they are keeping it relatively sideways.

Shits on Bitcoin a little bit. Acting can be hit or miss. But overall is pretty good.

Its pretty obvious that institutional money drove up the price after Futures were announced.  No way that was natural adoption growth. And they shorted Bitcoin. And suddenly a day before the contracts expired they all dumped and flooded the markets. Most likely with Bot Trading. 
So now we are at a level that is probably a more natural point if Wall street didn't jump in and rock the boat. But wall street is apparently going long on the new Futures. I wonder what will happen. I bet they just let the Bear Market do its thing and probably wont buy up Bitcoin to drive the price up and win their futures contracts.

I want websites to have ad space on the side and it will be a big blank space with a small amount of Bitcoin on it. And if I click on it, thats the amount of Bitcoin that I will receive.  Pay to have me look at your ad.  Basically, its Basic Attention Token. But just imagine Ad agencies loading up on Bitcoin to pay users to look at their ads. 
but what about bots clicking ads and stealing the money? Split the box into 9 boxes. 3X3. Have one box that says, "click here to view ad" . And clicking on any other box will disable the ad from being able to be viewed and profited on. So robots better learn to read or something. Cuz they seem to be fooled by those "Are you a robot?" buttons.

Tulips are an asset that the companies would sell.  Then people would buy options(paper tulips) driving up the price. The difference is if you didn't actually sell the tulip, then it would expire and be worthless.
Bitcoins that are being bought, already exist in the protocol, and they are being traded around. We aren't waiting for a centralized company to produce the next batch of bitcoins. Also they don't expire like Tulips. So if something really weird happened and no more bitcoins were produced after 16.5M. Then the market would simply adjust to the 16.5M bitcoin market place. But in that fictional scenario I think Bitcoin would lose a lot of trust.
Apples and Oranges

there is nothing to Topple. Its a scarce fungible asset. And at 21 Million, a very very limited production for an entire planet to share. 
Bitcoin will capture a gigantic market and will be seen as a safe haven asset. And other Coins will be used as currency. Like Litecoin. When Bitcoin captures a Trillion dollars or more, the average person's Bitcoin holdings is not going to move very much. They will only have hundreds of Satoshis worth. lol. And people will want that because they don't want volatility where they could lose $14k of wealth over a crazy weekend of high volatility. 
And other coins will prosper alongside Bitcoin. The trick is to buy ALL the top Cryptos you can and just wait for 5 years.

Technical Analysis is throwing chicken bones and reading them. It could work if there weren't so many new investors signing up on a daily basis. If the market was more bland and steady. But this is crypto. 
You got to read all the social media sites. Thats what controls the markets. Lots of bad news, people get worried and pull out and when enough people do that, the price moves down. All cuz of the news and what other people are sayiing on sites like reddit, twitter and facebook.

 Look its clear that Bitcoin is the worlds Biggest Gov't Psyop. They are trying to transition us from a collapsing system to a new more robust System. 
They they pumped the Price to get get us to realize this is the greatest transfer of financial wealth in human history. We maybe only have another year or two before the Dollar system completely implodes. 
They are trying to save us with out telling us directly. There are Patriots within the Gov't who are trying to Help us. And they did it through open source protocol and then backed off and tried to make it a grass roots movement so it wont be rejected by all the Libertarians and Conspiracy Theorist.

I don't think you understand Bitcoin. Lost coins don't affect the price, only the coins that are on the actual market exchanges affect the price. 
You can't tell the difference between Coins sitting silently in someones wallet for 5 years vs coins that are truly lost. 
Please tell me, are these  Bitcoins lost or just sitting in some random dude's wallet and how do you know?

yeah because selling tulips needs a business model. Stocks are based on Businesses. Which can go away. Bitcoin is just a supply of coins in a database. There is no Business model to Bitcoin. Its Just a Protocol. 
The Delusion phase is based on the profits a Business "could" produce. 
Bitcoin is simply supply and demand. The price is determined by the total amount of Bitcoins available on exchanges.

Now it's up to the president to decide who gets the money. Totally up to Trump.

read my original post. Manipulating the market upward and downward by injecting wealth into it, while may not be completely moral depending on the situation, its their choice or not whether they want to buy an asset or sell an asset. 
If they are spreading lies like JP Morgan's Jaime Dimon, yeah there should be rules against trying to drive down the price by spreading misinformation. 
But if Jaime wants to buy it and drive the price up, feel free. In the end, this is a very rare asset. only 21M will be produced and thats it. If they want to sell the coins and let real hodlers hodl, thats a risk for them. 
I own a % of the network, they can never take that away from me. And I can collect more.

But you can clothe your family with Bitcoin. I can go into Target or Walmart and spend Bitcoin straight out of my wallet for those clothes or for Food or to pay for gas to get to work. 
Coinbase offers a debit card. No different than any other credit or debit card.  I convert the money from my bank account on coinbase. If I keep that money in Coinbase, I can spend it with the debit card. Or I can transfer most of it out and only keep a little bit in there for emergencies.
And then there is also TenX

It does not cost $40 today to send a Bitcoin transaction. 
You want in on a secret? Wall street owns most of Crypto. Maybe not the coins themselves, but 85%-90% of the Crypto businesses. Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Abra, pretty much all of them. Not Bitmain though. Thats Chinese. But here is the deal, Nasdaq owns the Digital Currency Group (DCG)look at DCG's portfolio. ran by Gary Silbert. Big Wall Street Hedge Funder. Check out his bitcoin fund, GBTC. His Bitcoins are selling at a premium of $16.8k right now. Lightning Labs is also being funded by the DCG. 
The Lightning Network is being built By Wall Street FOR Wall Street. We are on the preface of something huge. Wall Street is about to turn on the firehose into cryptos. But not into Bitcoin Gold, Not into Bitcoin Private, Not into Bitcoin Diamond, and not into Bitcoin Cash.  They are going to unload into Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.
My working theory is that Wall Street did a test. They started flooding their money into Bitcoin in September, november and december and it got clogged up. It ran up the price, but the blocks were being filled up to 1MB and slowing down the network. Its true. Decentralized Blockchains are not very efficient. But the Lightning Network is on the Brink of coming online for Wall Street to use. The Lightning Network isn't for you and me. We can do on chain transactions no problem. Its for Businesses like VISA who process Millions upon Millions of transactions, and they can just settle on LN and do a single on chain transaction at the end of the day. And that way it wont clog up the Bitcoin Network for the rest of us. 
The Chinese realize this and they have co-opted Ver and a few others to trick people into buying up bcash with Bitcoin. You can't watch that video of Ver saying Mt. Gox is Solvent and say he isn't a conman.  There are many other coins that do "instant transactions" better than bcash. You want a fast coin for daily transactions, use Digibyte. Blazingly fast. I own some. Bcash is a Farce.  Huge Blocks is not the answer. Remember, every 10 minutes, you are adding that many Megabytes to the blockchain.

Bitcoin is the Value. And being able to send value to anyone in the world with no third party is the use case. That is what makes it valuable. That and the Network effect.

They can create new tokens, but they can't inject these tokens into the Bitcoin Ecosystem. Bitcoin is in a sealed container. 
Its like opening a Chuck E. Cheese in a region with lots of kids. 
Then some place way far away opens a new Chuck E. Cheese but the tokens at Place B, those tokens don't affect Place A. 
And further more, its all about the Network effect. The first few Networks fly up in value. But now you got to convince a lot of people who are becoming more and more knowledgeable about why your version of Ethereum is superior. Or, alright, I got my Digital Gold(Bitcoin) My Digital Silver(Litecoin) Digital Cash(DASH) why do I need any more payment coins? The only reason to get any other coin is if you are paying for taxes or drugs and they only accept a certain coin. But there is enough wealth on the plant for 50-100 Dominant Cryptocurrencies.

I'm using small blocks on Bitcoin RIGHT NOW. the fee is 5 cents. Proof: 


Not everyone will be using the Lightning Network. Everyday joe schmoe can use the Bitcoin Network like how we are using it this very day. It is working perfectly fine right now. Lighting Network is for Big Businesses, who have millions of transactions a day, and then they can settle on chain ONCE, at the end of the day. So they don't clog up the network. There isn't enough traffic to warrant bigger blocks. YET.  When the blocks are getting filled up by the Joe Schmoes of the world, I am sure Bitcoin will upgrade to a bigger block size. But until then, 1MB blocks are working fine.  LN is for Wall Street. 
 


Look up the Digital Currency Group and look at who owns them. Look at all the Crypto Businesses Goldman Sachs is buying.


Again, look into the DCG. Its Wall Street. And they are all in on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Not a Chinese Knock off Alt coin.

"Hoarding" or saving as my grandparents used to call it, serves the individual and is bad for Big Business.
Spending and having no savings is bad for the individual but good for Big Business. 
Buy what you need and save more than you spend. 
Decentralization IS inefficient, but its more secure from people doing bad things without consensus(audit the fed anyone?). 
After 10 years, bitcoin still works. It will have absorbed Dozens of Trillions of dollars and many institutions will have an incentive in maintaining the ledger and mining the daily transactions. 
I do not plan on selling my Bitcoin to the next bag holder for more. I plan on trading my Bitcoin for Items I really desire. Just recently I sold 38 Litecoins at $250 each to buy a New(to me) Lexus. It was a private sale and I asked him if he wanted the Litecoins or the cash. He made a good choice and asked for the cash. lol.

Not Sure I understand the question. In my head, you can divide the Votecoin many ways, you can vote for Republican, Democrat and Libertarian parties all in the same election. Give different amounts of your one Votecoin. Or just send it to Ashton Kutcher if you wanted to. XD


You can vote as soon as you receive your Votecoin.  But it would be wise to wait until election day so you have the Max amount of info about your candidate.


Once you send it, it is sent. No take backsies. So be sure of your candidate before you cast your Votecoin. 


The Cryptography shouldn't allow votes to change after the fact. Maybe if a Candidate got their Votecoin Wallet hacked and all their legitimate coins were sent to an opposing opponent, they should probably bring that up to Federal Officials. 


I'm hoping the mechanism to get each American their votecoin will have provisions that prevent hackers from accessing your votecoin. So everyone will be responsible for their own votecoin.

I mean, when you deposit your money in a bank and walk away, you are trusting that they will give it back to you when you ask for it. 
I get they can manipulate it, but until that trust is broken, dont we give them the benefit of the doubt. I mean, I sort of trust my local credit union will do the right and legal actions. But I still convert my fiat to bitcoins and litecoins.

Its all the new wealthy leaving. Weak hands. 
It seems to me, the Old Wealthy just got into Cryptos for the upcoming crash. 
And now the New wealthy want out and to retain their wealth in USD.
But with the upcoming crash, leaving crypto is an unwise move. This why the rich always get richer and the poor stay poor.

the only way the litecoin value would drop is if all litecoiners abandoned litecoin for those other coins which I dont see happening. Segwit doesn't mean other coins automatically absorb the other coins wealth and balances all out.

I see what you are saying and you are partially correct. The end goal isn't to die with as many bitcoins as possible. You want to buy stuff and live a happy life. 
But if you are trading a Good "Deflationary Money" for an "Inflationary Currency" to store your wealth, I don't think they get it yet. 
Or they could just be day trading. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:49:08
deflationary MONEY(Bitcoin is not a currency) helps everyone. It helps early adopters profit the most, but they took all the risk early on.  Late comers get the benefit of not losing value by storing their wealth in a fiat currency like the USD. 
So while people coming in now a days wont make $20 million off of $20 dollars, they can still secure their wealth and possibly double, triple or quadruple their money. Every $1000 put in today will probably be worth $4000 in a few ~~years~~ days. lol

I listen to every planet money and generally like their stories. I've sent their "why bankruptcies are good" to tons of Donald Trump haters. 
But this was a warning/hit piece. Stay away from bitcoin! That is all I could take from it. It felt dishonest and malicious, especially since one of the hosts(the guy who sent $5) actually seemed like he has known about Bitcoin for years and the main host didn't seem to know much. 
If anything, this tells me to dive wayyyy into Bitcoin. Because I know NPR is influenced by governmental suggestions and propaganda has been legal for a couple years now. 
I also felt like their Warren Buffet story of Him making a million dollar bet against hedge fund managers was also a governmental psy-op on the public. That story was basically about Warren Buffet putting all his betting money into the S&amp;P500 and him beating guys picking individual stocks. Basically saying, bet on the market as a whole because it usually comes out on top vs trying to find "winning" individual stocks.  After listening to it, it really made me want to go throw some money into the S&amp;P. But as a Bitcoiner, I know(think) the market is going to tank in the next couple years and this is probably a Psy-Op to try and trick the public in keeping their boat afloat a little bit longer. 
They can't fool me.

being able to transfer money peer to peer is an intrinsic value. Other than with cash or hard monies, you can't do this in our current monetary environment. 
You still have to ask permission from Paypal or Venmo. And they have to make sure its okay with your Bank. And they have to make sure its okay with their gov't.

Bitcoin and hard capped Cryptos are a Zero Sum game. There are only 21M bitcoins. thats it. No more, no less. As Bitcoin is bought up and taken off the market, the amount available becomes less and less until no one is offering to sell. But since everyone has their price, Bitcoins will always be on the market. but none the less, its still a ZERO sum game. 
USD is not Zero Sum because they create more and more of it every year.  Gold is technically Zero Sum because all the gold that will ever exist, exist somewhere in the earth. People just need to find it.

Digibyte is way better than both. 15 second blocks. 3 confirmations in under a minute. 1 dgb transaction fee. 
And can scale transactions. Every 2 years the DigiByte blockchain's dynamic system doubles the number of transactions per second by halving the block time, therefore as of 2016 it has a maximum capability of 280 transactions per second, this means the blockchain will be able to handle a maximum of 280,000 transactions per second by 2035
Lastly, it has a hard cap limit.

sure. But human psychology says people want to own whole units. People will seek out money that does just a good of a job if not better than Bitcoin if they can get whole units. Enter Litecoin and Digibyte. 
And the Bigger Bitcoin gets with more miners, the harder its going to be to come to a consensus. Look at politics, no one can 100% agree on anything. Climate Change, Flat Earth, Conspiracies,  whether Pineapple belongs on pizza or not. People Want to use Bitcoin A and other People want to use Bitcoin B. And this will happen 100+ times when the rest of the 7 Billion people wake up and get on board. 
another factor. Bitcoin cant replace the whole banking sector. It doesn't offer certain features that a bank can. For example, A Certificate of Deposit. A Time Deposit. Richard Heart is about to release the first Crypto CD called Hex. Which I think is pretty cool. Long story short, is that After Bitcoin Holders claim their Hex, Hex will have a 3.68% inflation. The inflation will be paid to Hex Holders who Stake and lock up their funds. 
Don't worry, there is a lot of wealth on this planet. There is plenty of money for each blockchain.

you the know the difference I see between ETH and Bitcoin. Is that Bitcoin has one really good use case. Settlement Network. 
ETH is only valuable because of the promise of Dapps. 
What happens when a competitor to ETH comes along and people want to program for that over ETH? I think ETH dies. 
It very well could be that ETH is the Blackberry of Modern Blockchain and at any moment, an Iphone Blockchain like company could come and steal all the thunder and programers making Ethereum useless.

Not much, what up with you dog?
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:25:43
honestly, don't worry about the taxes. 
But if you put in $20 and Bitcoin rises, you can then sell it for whatever profit. Coinbase takes 1.5% Which isn't bad. $1.50 for every $100 converted. 
Welcome Aboard!

Here is the thing that gets me. There is an article out there that states Darpa closing their Lifelog program the same day Facebook was Founded. So people theorize that the lifelog program simply became Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg was chosen as the Handler in Charge. 
If this is True, then the whole movie and story of Zuckerberg stealing it from the winklevoss twins is bull shit. 
And if that story is bull shit, why are the twins lying? I understand why Mark would lie and cover it up, but why would Tyler and Cameron go along with it?
Maybe they were offered a huge pay day. First ownership of a new Global Currency. I mean, they KNEW something. They filed for paper work to launch a bitcoin exchange in 2013. I really feel like they were guided. 
Perhaps, guided by Mark "Satoshi Nakamoto" Zuckerberg. Suddenly Facebook launches its own Crypto too???? Too coincidental in my book.

The cool thing is bakkt and fidelity are creating products that will push physical Bitcoin into retirement funds and 401k's of Americans. Soon Bitcoin will be backing the retirement of millions of rich Americans. When the rest of the world and realizes that Bitcoin is backed by American Retirements, they will realize that we don't want to lose that money either and it will be seen as a sound investment. That's when the rest is the world starts piling in. Including Chinese.

thats fake news bro. The Deep State held NK hostage for the most part. Then they made NK the boogey man. The Deep State were the hackers.
Then Trump nuked the deep state hiding in the north korean mountains and free'd Kim. Kim was finally allowed to travel and he met with Trump in Singapore. They told Kim if he played ball and stayed a good boy, he could have everything Singapore has and more. 
Thats how Trump made peace in the Soon to be United Koreas.
