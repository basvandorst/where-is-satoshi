Well it kinda makes sense that it wouldn't do well. Why would anyone buy a currency not as advanced when BTC is right there?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:02:29
If it tanked to $1000 tomorrow I sure as fuck would not be buying. I know many would but nope

It was one of those things where if you had a decent surplus of money you could afford to play around with it and maybe get a few bitcoins (like the Winklevoss twins).If you don't have a ton of money in surplus you would probably much rather do something safe.
I got $10 worth of bitcoin back 2014 from a Coinbase just having an .edu and it's now worth about $300. Slowly spending it but really it's just been fun to watch it

So that's pretty much untraceable forever isn't it?

I just sold at 19k! I only had 0.0156 btc though so I only got $290 out of it.

So the person with the key was probably storing it on something or gave it out? I just knew you couldn't find someone based on just a wallet address or whatever 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:41:47
It hit like $8.5k. Good thing I have no money and couldn't buy any! :/

I'm just gonna go ahead and ask you. I have my btc on coinbase. How exactly do I move it to something only I have access to? Also, then how do I send it to people?

Satoshi Bitcoin

I got 0.02233 BCH randomly on December 13... literally didn't do anything. Any reason you could think of? I should've sold it one hour ago now it's sort 1/3 of what it was
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:05:25
Just be happy for everyone else :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:22:18
Ohh. So I pretty much had double the money but bch crashed so now it's worth not as much.
So what is the future of bitcoin cash?? I can't see it rising to the levels of bitcoin just by reading everyone's comments here
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:47:28
So basically sell my BCH is what you're saying. And to answer your first question, no. I remember getting an email from coinbase a while back when they said there was gonna be a fork. I had actually thought it would mean double my money but then told myself that would make zero sense

He's quoting The Office lol. Specifically season 5 episode 19 "Golden Ticket"
Daryl tells him they load up like 5 pallets of paper a day for Blue Cross telling him they use a lot of paper. Then michael says, "I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to be honest... what is a pallet"
Fuckin hilarious episode

I want it hit $2K before I sell but who knows if it actually can

PayPal is so frustrating. And I really wish I could never use them ever again. But since I use their father company, eBay, all the time, I guess I can't go around them.
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:46:42
I wonder how many stories there were of people that realized they still had some BTC on an old hard drive or laptop. I know there were people that trashed their HDDs.
@_date: 2018-03-10 06:04:03
I was given 0.022 BCH on coinbase after that fork and I still never understood it 
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:58:36
Well I wanted it to get to like $30 before I sold it but I feel as if that’ll never happen
