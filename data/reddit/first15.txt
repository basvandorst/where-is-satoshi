Not trying to be a smart ass ninja but what if its sent ups or fed ex. Would that change your opinion?

Correct me if im wrong because i am brand new to bitcoin but Wouldnt i still have to release the coins for them to rob me?  If i show up without any cash. What could they rob me of?

I tried the default browser and also chrome on my android. Bitpay.com pulls up fine but the visa page loads blank. I will try to access it from my computer later. Thanks for the idea.

Thank you commenting Max. Very good points. I guess one of my concerns about western union etc. Is how many transactions from different places would have to take place before i'm flagged to look into. I am looking for a long term option

Thank you for your advice. Theres only one person in my area exchanging cash in person and his minimum is higher than I was originally wanting to sell but I can adjust to make it work.

Thank you for the article iamatablet, I wouldnt be doing 5 digit transactions which i believes lowers my risk. I hope it wouldnt be worth it to someone to stab me for under $1k while i understand it does happen for a lot less, I believe if i stuck to more seasoned buyers and lower amounts I could avoid that.
Edit: thought your comment said both. I misspoke but my opinion remains the same.

Anonymous, thank you for the article. Not meeting in person lead me to believe i'd have less chance of being robbed. Do you recommend that as the best option for selling bitcoin or what are your thoughts?

What recommendations would you make for precautions on bank deposits?

I tried going to their website for the card, bitpay.com/visa and it loads a blank screen. Has anyone gotten anything else?
