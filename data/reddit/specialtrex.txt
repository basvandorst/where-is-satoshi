Worthy of an upvote.

As much as I can get all revved up with a good AP post, this guy has a gambling problem, delusions of granduer, and quite possibly a mental illness.
Look through his post history.  He created a sub dedicated to himself and (with a few exceptions) he's the only one that posts in it. Not saying bitcoin isn't awesome, or that it isn't a game changer, but don't take anything that AP says without getting a second opinion.
*Edit: Thanks for the downvote, AP, you giant pussy stain.

Yes, thanks for following up an hour after my initial post for that one instance.  I stand corrected.

If I said to you that I once paid 10,000 btc for two pizzas, it makes a big difference if that story is from 2010 or 2013.  The 'real' value of bitcoin is still being felt out.  It's changed dramatically and is liable to continue doing so for an unknown time frame, until further notice we'll have to stay measured on their scale.

Not really bitcoin related but I'm an old paulbot so w/e. Plus the Patriot Act is something *we all need to pay attention to for our own sakes* but that's none of my business.

Interesting; micro payments partnering with [micro satellites](

It's that much sweeter when you do though- a coworker actually brought it up to *me* at a happy hour when we were talking about investments.
I had to contain myself.

Que bueno!

good thing he's a registered republican.

Gahh autocorrect always thinks I'm talking about bitchin'
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:38:24
Exactly. No other possibilities; move along.

Guys I upvoted a famous journalist!

What's going to take bitcoin to the next level, their announcement?
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:29:41
I have had OP tagged as "Mental Illness" in neon pink for a long time.
@_date: 2015-03-30 04:55:43
But how would that be impacted by price volatility?
@_date: 2015-03-02 06:18:39
What country are you in?
Presuming you're in the US (because I am), you can easily use Circle or Coinbase to buy bitcoin.
You can use  to get a general idea of the exchange rate.

This got posted one day ago and it was the first I'd seen as far as a real low barrier to hosting a node:

Just read through his posting history. The narcissism is off the charts and his delusions of grandeur are unmatched.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:27:58
Bada ba bah bahhhhhhhh
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:23:23
Thanks for responding personally.  
This could be an opportunity for further education to the people already interested in bitcoin and therefore more receptive to the information.  If Coinbase were to create an internal program of how and why it's critical to control you own private keys in the new world of bitcoin, it would mitigate this misconception in addition to providing this initial wave of education for new users. Win win.

You could say the same things about carrying cash, or an expensive purse, or wearing a nice watch; a "corrupt individual" could decide they want to take it from you.
While it's true that the ease of access would allow for easier theft of $500,000,000, or Ƀ2,059,000 in the literal sense (click), controlling important documents, valuables, and other items in the physical sense are already something people know how to do.

The NSA may have? Stop spreading FUD and go back to the sidelines.
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:12:51
Does anyone use this? They get no press compared to coinbase/circle; last I could find they had high(er?) fees.
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:33:16


That sounds pretty alright to me.
@_date: 2015-03-06 05:10:11
Possibly, but only if you spend your bitcoin from their wallet.  Exchange your dollars to bitcoin and then send those coin to your own wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-02 05:01:23
..and how do you get a major adoption push? Marketing.
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:18:33
Well sure officer, I'd give em to you if I had them, but the private keys went over the edge of the boat during the squall. Remember, my guns went overboard as well.. And my jewelry..
