It absolutely **can** be made transparent and behind the scenes.  I don't think it *will* for a while still, and who knows, it may be too late, but it definitely can.
People already are familiar with debit cards, and the idea of having to have money in an account to spend it, so it's not much of a stretch.  Eventually, wallets will get to the point where using LN is essentially transparent, heck some will probably even create one behind-the-scenes without you even knowing it, and *only* provide LN services, but in a way the user doesn't have to deal with it, and can use it like a normal account.
Again, it'll probably be a while before LN is stable and then before wallets integrate this kind of support, but it's definitely possible in a way that most people can understand.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:22:56
You don't have to trust anyone in regards to the crypto itself.
But you definitely have to trust the person to actually deliver what they promised after you pay, as there is no way (as I understand it) to charge that "Off-chain Transaction" back after you've "published" it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:02:14
Untrue.  Mostly at least.
Lightning isn't centralized itself, as it's a mesh network where you can open a channel to X person, and if they have an open channel to Y, and Y has a channel to Z, you can transact with Z through the chain.  So there is no 'service' that a single entity can shut down, freeze, block, etc.  There also isn't any 'central' services that are technically in control of your funds in any way.
That being said, I do agree there is some worry and possibility LN could cause centralization, as that may be what is most convenient to the users, and LN *allows* centralization to occur a bit easier.  However, it definitely doesn't add much centralization directly itself.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:24
I would think it would, at least temporarily, until adoption increases enough to fill the blocks again.
That should be quite a while though, as if LN is used heavily, it should take a massive load off the chain.

The other problem is that for normal people, 5000 sats/USD is confusing, because that would mean that is actually MORE valuable than 6000 sats/USD.
I like the idea of sats/USD, but it's more confusing at first glance.

That's.....  Disappointing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:22:05
Could you explain what said was wrong then?
He said that it is possible under lightning to do *2-of-3 party escrow in Lightning, functionally the same as the use case for on-chain "2-of-3 multisig" escrow systems*
Which while it might not **technically** be 2-of-3 multisigs, from the link he provided, it sounds as if it would be functionally the same.

Wow, does Etherium not have thin clients like Electrum for BTC, where it sacrifices Verification, and some privacy for near-instant synchronization?

Probably not if you gave a splash screen saying you were doing it, (noone reads the terms anyways...)

@_date: 2018-05-30 23:15:42
I actually disagree in general.
Merchants get screwed over *often* with current payment systems, with charge-backs, and when cards turn out to be stolen.
When it comes to BTC, double-spends are possible, but at least at the current point in time, difficult enough to pull off that as a merchant I would **much** rather accept 0-conf for order under a few hundred dollars than deal with the current payment systems.
Doesn't really matter though, assuming LN turns out to be all it looks like it's turning out to be.

Ok, first of all, I'm not the original person who posted that, I was just providing the information you asked for.  Second, neither of us 'received lots of upvotes,' not that that matters anyways.
Regardless of how you look at it, for the week or so when the EDA was active and not "fixed" as it is now, it was far beyond what was reasonable.  But they fixed it, so you can't blame them directly for the unintended effects from it anyways.

Not sure if it was *quite* that high, but shortly after the EDA (Emergency Difficulty Adjustment) was added, Miners realized they could game BCH's EDA by switching back and forth between BTC and BCH, forcing BCH to inflate incredibly quickly.

Cloudflare also does Keyless SSL, so they can provide the SSL endpoint without you having to give up your keys.  It's a very cool technology that solves many of the issues (but not all) while allowing you to maintain complete control of your SSL keys.
Of course, they only offer it for enterprise customers, and you have to contact them directly to even learn how you actually go about setting it up.  (Though of course, there's lots of documentation as to how it technically works.)

I was going to say that it should be easy, but yeah this is Ku band, (relatively high frequency) and they only have a module out for GNU Radio companion.

In the core BTC chain, yes.
There's already been close to 2MB blocks in the BCH / BCC chain.  
EDIT:  4+ already I guess....
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:48:28
It seems to only be live / recent blocks from what I can tell at the moment.
It should be within practicality to broadcast the entire blockchain every so often, I would think the limitation on that would be the satellite's power reserves.  The frequency has plenty of bandwidth, but if it's just broadcasting a block every time one is mined, the satellite can be dormant most of the time, and be a very small / cheap sat.
I would assume that it would have to be significantly larger to be able to broadcast information to make an initial sync, but I have no idea what the satellites they are using are like.

While you are correct, It's *very* similar to a project you might see in I'm not trying to demean it, but it's very much a hobby kind of project at the moment.  There's no 'easy' or set, or even commercial way to do it.  They make suggestions, tell you how to hook it all together, how to get it decoding, etc.  But it's very much a "find hardware that meets these requirements" and then they leave it to that.
Definitely not demeaning it, though.  I see great things in the future for this, and am considering hacking on it myself-  I've got a couple dishes and some radio hardware lying around.

I understand how this type of thing is awesome, but doesn't it incentivize miners to mine blocks with no transactions, as their block would propagate faster than a block full of transactions?

Not saying I'm for it whatsoever, but if you were to draw a line, perhaps draw it at where Public keys became hidden until spent from.
That way, you're only affecting those early wallets that would be at risk from a theoretical quantum computer.

Yup.  Modern encryption (if done right) is *insanely* secure.
However, they may be able to link bluetooth / wifi mac addresses to specific phones, if manufacturers keep of a record of that.  That could allow you to link some traffic to a person, but it'd still only be barely useful.

@_date: 2017-10-15 01:56:59

@_date: 2018-07-19 02:08:06
I think it's the same number of bits, so it's just as secure, but a few more characters to make up for the lack of capitals?
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:16:48
Again, I'm in no way an expert, so anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but:
I am quite interested in quantum computing, even though I really don't understand it fundamentally.  All the news articles, papers, and pretty much all public projects on quantum computing still have a very small number of qubits, while many more are required to actually break factorization-based cryptography (find the prime numbers used to secure RSA, etc.)
The largest publicly disclosed factorization using quantum computing is only 143, which we can factor using a basic computer in less than a second, and is not even in the same ballpark as the size of numbers used in modern cryptography.
I personally think we're a long ways off from being able to break any sort of cryptography with quantum computing, but I suppose there is always the possibility of someone having a decently-sized quantum computer, and keeping it secret.

Yeah, I installed a copy on a portal external hard drive that I plug into computers at school and boot off of.

in addition to what said, once spent, an address loses it's resistance to quantum computing. 
(At least as of now.)
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:08:54
But you could use lightning network without consistent internet access.
Heck, if you made some changes to the locktimes, you could make a channel that would work for off-line transactions for months between having internet access.
Only downside is making it longer like that would also make closing the channel by yourself take *very* long.
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:32:31
Yup, agree with all your points, except for the cracking modern encryption bit.
There are much more likely vectors than actually cracking the encryption itself.  For example: weak passwords, implementation bugs, weaknesses not yet discovered in algorithms, quantum computers, etc.
But if you rule all those out, the keyspace in 256-bit security is **insane**.  If you exclude weak passwords by using something akin to a keyfile for security, perhaps something similar to how Signal does it, it's essentially impossible to crack, even with all the money and time in the world.
Here's a great video on just how huge the 2^256 keyspace is:     (Video is in relation to bitcoin, but applies here too.)
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:55:57
Well, I'm in no way an expert, and if I'm wrong, please correct me, but essentially the way I have always understood it is:
The only information that would be visible to an attacker when an address has not been reused is quantum-resistant.  That is, there is currently no known quantum algorithm that could be used to compute / brute-force the hash / cryptography for that address.
However, once coins are spent from an address, the *actual* public key is revealed, (not just a hash of the public key) and them a quantum computer with enough qbits could easily calculate the primes, and derive the private key from the public key.

Short version:
It contacts a C&amp;C server, which generates a public &amp; Private encryption key, and sends the public key to the client (infected box) and tells it to encrypt everything it can.
It then goes and searches it's entire drive, and ALL MOUNTED network drives for any of a large list of word processing documents, video &amp; audio production formats, and other stuff, and encrypts them all.
Only then does it inform the user, telling them that they are screwed if they don't pay up (and they are.)
Most of them (the main variant) will actually unlock your files for you (decrypt them) if you pay up.  However, there's a couple variants I've heard about that don't.

Basically, the blue area shows sell orders.
So if you were willing to pay a price of up to 750 each, according to this chart, you could buy up to somewhere around 1250 at that price of 750 each.  Whereas if you were willing to pay up to 760 each, there's around 1600 at that price (or lower.)
Similar on the green side.  That would show sell orders.  So if you were to but in an order to buy coins at 650, there would be somewhere around 1700 which you would buy imidiently.

I am definitely no expert, but:
As far as I can think, these kinds of charts do not help very much in terms of showing what is most likely to happen next.  (I would argue no charts could predict this well.)
what it **does** show you, however, is how quickly the market could move in either way.
As an example, if the price was going up:
* If people bought somewhere around 400 coins, the price would rise to ~732, or there abouts.
* If people were to buy around 700 coins, the price would only rise to ~735.  
This is because there is a huge jump somewhere around $734 or so.  Someone (or a lot of people) have around ~300 coins for sale at ~$734.
Another way to think about it is just looking at the steepness of the graph.  If someone were to start buying large amounts of coins, They would only have to buy somewhere around 400 coins to make the price rise to $732, and this would cost somewhere below $290k.  However, if they wanted to make the price rise past $732, say to $736, they would have to spend over $220,000.  And that is just to make the price rise by ~$4.
**TL;DR:**  Steepness of graph shows how fast market can swing in either direction.
