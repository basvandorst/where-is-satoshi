Headline: Feds befuddled as Bitcoin operations continue in wake of headquarters shutdown.

Nonsense.  
It's backed by Xbox Live Gold now.

These are **not** bitcoins stolen from Sheep Marketplace. This was the wallet that people *thought* housed the stolen coins.  
In the end, it just turned out to be a wallet owned by BTC-e, which the thief used to sell his coins.

Are you sure they didn't change your email address in BTC-e? (I'm not sure if this is possible or not)  
If they didn't, then your yahoo account was most likely compromised.  
You can use this site to see if your account has been compromised through various recent high profile hacks (adobe, target, etc.).

Check the transaction history on the blockchain. You may be able to piece together what happened, and prevent it from happening in the future.  
  
And for the love of god, man. 25 characters or more!

I didn't know Chase.com had ads.  
Thank you, adblock. :)

I already do. But now I'd buy it with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:37:49
.00000002 satoshi? That's .00000000000002 Bitcoins. You're really undervaluing your opinions.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:13:28
Check the address you sent to on blockchain.info.  
Do you see the transaction there?  
If not, don't fret. It's just slow network stuff.  
If it's there, continue to not fret, and tell us more info. (or just give us the link)
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:14:38
None at all.  
Move along.

Look into data recovery services.  
Your hard drive is most likely recoverable, and even at $300 for data recovery, it's more than worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:01:16
I'll give it a go.  
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:48:47
Well, luckily no one's fallen for it.

I once cracked a cabinet door in half with a cork. I can't imagine my penis doing that. I mean, the door was at *most* a 5.

Weird, my Humble Bundle transaction was literally instant. I sent the bitcoins from Bitcoin-QT, and got an email less than a minute later, confirming my purchase.

Drops from $900 to $500: No mainstream news.  
Skyrockets back to $1200: No mainstream news.  
Drops from $1100 to $800:

That's... not good.  
Definitely report this to Blockchain.info support.  
  
Did you click any links in the chatbox?

What we need now is some kind of campaign to quell the fear.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:24:47
It's worth a shot, but I doubt it'll happen any time soon.  
They just recently (this year, I think) started accepting credit cards directly (not through paypal).  
So they're pretty slow with their payment options.
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:42:01
Possible, yes. But the chance of finding a private key after running the thing for 100 years is roughly the same as finding one by repeatedly banging your fists on the keyboard for 12 seconds.  
(pretty unlikely)

Sounds like an altcoin made by Al Gore's wife.

Especially during a leap year.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:45:09
It really sucks that this happened to you, and I feel really bad.  
  
But the irony here is hilarious.

My favorite thing is explaining BitCoin to friends and family. It feels like I'm explaining cell phones to a rural farmer in the 1960's.

You should have said 10,582 satoshi (roughly 2 cents at the current MtGox rate).

Oh, good. You included a banana.  
Now I know how big that desk is.

As much as I dislike the fact that memes are taking over this sub, I simply can't not upvote this.
