Jesus Christ, there are quite a few asses here.

That's his point, Coinbase doesn't give you your wallet keys. The best option would be to download a wallet, from there your private key will never be shared, so as long as you have that key, you will always have your bitcoin. Even better would be to make a paper wallet, just to make sure there is nowhere for your private key to leak. 
If you want to stick with an online wallet, I'd use Blockchain.info. On Blockchain.info, they will provide you your private key, also you can add your own wallets to it!

How is it complicated. If you don't know how bitcoin works.. Get the hell outta here.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:30:19
I read that in a sad like voice..
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:17:52
Who cares what you'll use them for! 
Shit, I'd buy just because they accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:35:27
Akon is not Iyaz... What is up with my brain?
@_date: 2014-05-03 07:01:12
Is it what?
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:36:35
Somedays I dream about running a country, but laws are made by owners of property, and a few nation wide laws to equal out poor and rich. Would be awesome.
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:01:43
Yea, any good deals? I haven't see any.
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:25:34
It's still humorous though.
At least to me.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:05:45
I see nothing wrong with it. It's better than people signing up on a website just for that job. They can use changetip anywhere! It opens alot of possibilities for them also. Bitpay should integrate this function, or merge with ChangeTip.
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:55:04
That accent man!
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:05:29
He should totally start one
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:49:04
Yes, we need this! 
Hopefully before Christmas.
[I posted a link to this thread over at r/ChangeTip] (
Hopefully it will pick up there!
@_date: 2014-11-29 04:52:11
You can store Bitcoin keys anywhere, and any how. As long as the product of the thing you are using to keep track of the key is definite, there could be bitcoin keys everywhere. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:55:28
This is old news! 
Plus, DONT FUCKING USE CAPS LOCK!
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:55:59
That's great you were able to get those 6 months! 
Sucks he died though.

Could it only be Chase?
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:08:11
How would the read it to see? The only way to do it is send it to a email changetip controls. Changetip gets notified on other social platforms. And they're public so the boy can see.
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:43:57
I would love the site, I would actually put it on my large wall monitor when I'm not using it, but the text flying from right to left just pisses me off, make it an option.
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:05:42
This is why you download programs/addons from **TRUSTED** sources.

OMG I'M LOL'ING SO HARD RIGHT NOW!
@_date: 2014-05-02 14:09:51
Thank you! :P
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:21:23
Yes! We should convince Circle or some other exchange to accept gift cards and prepaid cards. 
That would most definitely be my most used exchange.
Get on this, circle...
@_date: 2014-05-03 06:53:22
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:27:55
No. 
Buy, buy, buy.. It's bound to happen.
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:21:57
Man.. I wish so hard I had circle.. The UI makes me cum and the features are amazing. I wish I was in your shoes mate.
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:43:41
I'm not shorting, I'm snorting.

What the fuck!? I saw that to!
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:15:05
Okay.. Dont believe me if you dont want to. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:19:53
Will it be uploading to YouTube or something afterwards?
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:04:41
The problems which could be avoided by using bitcoin.. This is fucking sick mate, thanks for the share.
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:07:00
Just so you know, I didn't really know about GoCityHotels.com before now. 
I am very grateful to hear about it and the fact that it accepts bitcoin (soon.) 
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:41:30
Awwwwwe yeaah! We're number six!!!!
@_date: 2014-11-22 04:55:54
Those are right there on the homepage!
@_date: 2014-11-16 04:31:08
Nah, man. Sometimes transactions take hours.

Can I be one?

Emergency BTC &gt; Gyft &gt; Walmart
@_date: 2014-05-03 02:53:07
We need a preev-like site where we can convert bitcoin to gold.
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:45:06
I would tip you, as a thank you for being so generous to people.. 
Then logic set in.
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:04:08
Shes the base reason he has all this money now!
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:34:00
So.. It's like reddit itself? 
Awesome xD
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:39:25
I should just stop here, shouldn't I?
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:50:53
Hi, I'm a dildo.
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:47:51
Alright I turned it off with inspect element, but I don't want to have to do that on every visit.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:31:18
Dude.. Really? I usually tip 100 bits for something tip-worthy.. Unless I'm inclined to tip more.
2 bits @_date: 2014-11-21 23:21:54
An ultra-computer, out of our reach. 
All of our computers and super-computers power combined still won't break it. We will one day have the power to do so, but that's after our current bitcoin by a long shot.
As Voogru implied, the math is concrete.
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:55:26
It's like push the envelope of profit, go to far.. Boom, there goes that envelope. 
As much as I would love to have a whole data center dedicated to bitcoin, I know that it is unrealistic and against the idea of decentralization.
Once I have an fair amount of money, I'm going to buy a scrypt miner. Which I hope to grow into a farm, if I could get minimum wage from mining.. I'm set. I'll still have a job though.  
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:54:19
No, no, no! 
It will be something like, "Can I have 500,000 Bits?".
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:17:15
This actually would not be hard at all.
In fact, probably easier.
@_date: 2014-04-28 03:47:15
Yea, we need a **REALLY** simple way to hook people.
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:10:57
The new Dogecoin
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:10:20
The fuck? lol 
Which card company? This can't be the same for everything.
@_date: 2014-04-28 03:18:01
No, really I just got into LTB.
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:10:52
Bits are 1 millionths of a bitcoin.
I was talking about how the characters verbally asked for money.
@_date: 2014-04-28 03:20:14
Man.. Don't say that, I swear bitcoin saved my life.
@_date: 2014-11-22 12:24:01
Could you possibly tell me the working one's brand?
@_date: 2014-05-03 02:45:55
The average person should have enough intelligence not to fall for malicious hoax.
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:51:25
You can buy from someone.
@_date: 2014-12-06 22:28:02
Couldn't we just send it too an other address and give them the private key?
@_date: 2014-05-03 07:06:40
You sicken me, just a new kid thinking his idea is the next big thing.
It's fucking dumb. 
Go eat a fucking pinecone.
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:12:55
Lets Talk Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:32:01
Wow, I'm usually up to call on my grammar.
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:58:46
I want to be in control of my private key, so far, I have seen no way to access my private keys. Also I cannot add my own wallet, I remember the option, but it didn't work. I wish I could use coinbase, I may use it like an irl wallet, hold about $50 for quick purchases in it and stuff. This problems may be fixed, if so tell me.
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:34:38
Thats awesome! I'm thinking of getting one as an Iowa plate, actually that plate is VERY lucky, there will only be 50. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:01:05
Quite the alibi really, it can neither be told true or untrue.
Although, I really wish this is SN... Seems amazing!
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:56:38
The power there is cheap as hell.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:10:38
Wow... you are so dark!


Then, Death!


@_date: 2014-04-23 23:16:38


Really, than what is Unflod.dylib? It came in a jailbreak tweak but you can get it other ways.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:13:14
Here, in the midwest of the US, we get gas around $3.40 per gallon.

@_date: 2014-11-12 14:59:09
Thats like $16,000 now :0
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:17:50
How are they sposed to access your email?
@_date: 2014-11-23 08:27:55
Use circle.com
I'm not sure if that prepaid card works, but some do, some don't.
@_date: 2014-11-21 23:27:57
You forgot a few zeros bro.
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:50:48
Yes! Fucking dumbass trying to be 'smart' and 'clever'.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:55:48
Totally hear the themes.
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:27:35
I'm here to reply to a reply.
@_date: 2014-04-28 03:16:15
I guess I see where you are coming from, but you can do quick research and find out everything.
If you want to learn about bitcoin, do it.
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:14:58
@_date: 2014-05-02 03:37:15
Smack that, all on the floor. Smack that, give me some more. Smack that, till you get sore. Smack that.. oooyooo.
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:15:35
Not sure if they have a lot of Bitcoin ATMs there, but if you find one, that may be your best option. Try prepaid cards with circle.
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:26:40
I though one or the other was made by some of the employees, soon to be run by the other. I'm not sure which came first. I thought it just grew into ebay or paypal, which ever came first. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:01:57
I saw this. Thanks for declaring it publicly
@_date: 2014-04-26 04:05:06
I think he should to, tell them about all the weed that you bought.
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:42:49
I'm laughing my ass off! Did you mean to do that?
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:08:04
More or less
@_date: 2014-09-15 21:42:26
I will now be calling mBTC "magic beans".

That has Internet...
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:13:58
No, you'll be gaining money.
Although it does cost that fake fiat crap.
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:30:43


Only earth my dear friend.
@_date: 2014-05-02 20:15:52
Cleaned out by malware? Thats her fucking fault.
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:08:19

Possibly, but wouldn't he want that?

All metal will be forcibly removed by the magnets.
@_date: 2014-04-24 01:44:27
Maybe you are SN.
Its so funny, we praise SN like our god!
I wish one day we will know his ID.
@_date: 2014-09-25 02:02:42
Just posted about this also, I'm so happy lol.

Bits for life bro, I gauge my wallet in bits.

Was going to think about donating, until I saw this comment. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 18:27:18
So Gold bugs doesn't like banks... The money is not in his hands right? 
His comment makes 0 sense. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 04:15:01
My whole world is a lie, I totally believed that they were magnetic!
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:37:14
Tell her about the fees and how smart it is!
Sugarcoat it tho, my mom owns a daycare... 
She believes I am a incredible hacker because I mine them.
I told her basically everything about it, but she wont budge..
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:32:02
This just reinforces my plan to move to Voat. That's quite amazing brother. Can't wait till they're back up. I am very proud actually.
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:20:39
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:51:49
I think its great!
You should promote this around Pittsburgh, hopefully people will get on board.
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:37:19
Wow, I'd like to see more research on this, seems interesting. Thanks for noticing it! 
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:21:22
You see this is bitcoin growing fast over in greece. These people will bring more and more people. You'll see. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:58:58
You're thinking locally, all of those are available due to them working with your nation's currency. Thats exactly what Ewokjed was trying to argue against. With crypto you can send funds all around the world (Even space if there is a node connected to the network) with a click of a button. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:10:25
Same story here sold off at nearly 2k expecting a good dip, I bought some back when it was jumping around $70. God I wish I held.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:56:12
It was founded on Monday bro. That building was already there.
They great plans for a city.
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:14:32
For me it is, I personally don't have doubt.
But you don't just want to take my opinion, and rely on it.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:39:57
1 in 500k? What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2015-04-18 13:36:42
Oh my, I'm tempted to plan to move their in my later years. I've done a little research. I at least want to visit that place. Can't wait to see what comes out of here.
@_date: 2015-04-19 13:19:55
Oh, I see now.
@_date: 2015-03-06 16:17:21
15 here!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:39:03
And thats how you should! Not enough people have the sense to break up their investments.
@_date: 2016-05-12 00:38:36
Yes it could! But it would be a very big and hard thing to do. We would need to get over 51% of bitcoin nodes to agree that those transactions didn't happen. We would have ALOT of chaos from this though. And given the statue of the problem, it most likely wouldn't be fixed.
And don't be scared, there is not going to be that big of a bug, 3rd parties may hit a bug, but not the whole network.
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:47:22
Omg op its so cute!!!!
So is the Baby and the Chick. Lol jp. 
Congrats OP start training him/her to mine bitcoin soon.
