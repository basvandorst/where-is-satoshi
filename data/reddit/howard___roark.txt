Depending on gains, not losses, this is a 2 yr hodl, minimum. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:21
I haven't bought anything.  I've been waiting since it was at 9k.  And now it sounds like people are having trouble even buying.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:07:33
account.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:59:47
Bank already released it.  I def would NOT call it a large deposit either lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:14:23
I don't show my linked bank account on gdax.  It does show on coinbase.  If I make a purchase on GDAX will it pull it from my linked bank account on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:12:14
Oh yeah?  What news?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:01:39
Ughhh.  I thought it was 3pm est?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:01:42
i do.  thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:31:24
the funds haven't cleared though.  I was going to purchase it and then it just takes the 7 days to pull from my account.  Will that work if I make the buy on GDAX or do you have to have the money available first to buy on gdax.?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:34:26
I'm stuck picking a wallet because there's a bunch to choose from.  Is there a consensus on which is best?  I would never trust a hard drive so that's one method I would never use.  
Also, guess I was confused.  I thought gdax and coinbase shared your account info because they were the same company.  I didn't think you'd have to do anything.  I thought your account was visible in both.  I'm waiting on deposited money so I haven't seen anything firsthand. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:57:58
How long does it usually take for them to be approved?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:08:37
Another exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:32:47
Expensive?  It's $80 that could potentially store $1,000,000,000,000,000 dollars
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:09:51
I bought at $158.  I want to buy more so bad right now.  I'm waiting until the crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:27:40
wire is basically immediately or within an hour I believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:40:58
Correct.  Major if. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:54:04
Oh God lol.  Okay then.  Won't be doing that 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:40:12
Upvoting because I have a ledger nano and now I guess I need to be thinking about backups.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:11:06
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:26:12
Exactly.  There's no fucking way I want to buy my first bitcoins from them 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:41:32
Has anyone had a pending coinbase deposit clear but not show up in your balance(cleared from bank account and coinbase)?  I'm not sure if I should be concerned or start contacting coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:25:29
I view this as more of a sales pitch because they have so much skin in the game.  Either way, I hope they are right.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:05:10
Can you short Bitcoin? Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:02:56
I think you're missing out on the futures variable.  No one knows what impact that could have.  It drive prices higher before crash, crash it even more, or have no impact.  Those years are very different. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:36:56
I'm buying in now and want to buy more but I don't know when these purchases will be approved. If prices spike due to futures can I sell through coinbase even if they haven't been approved yet?  The wait to clear is driving me nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:52:05
If I buy bitcoins using gdax, is it safe to leave it there?  Will I also be able to use coinbase to purchase and see what I own via gdax and vice versa? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:58:50
Apparently it won't.  I have to wait until Monday. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:54:15
It's been cleared from my bank for days.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:04:02
Okay damn.  I already submitted a ticket for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:11:21
Just got into using binance as well.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:50
Yeah, I'm not too worried.  I can always buy more and wait the 7 days to clear.  I just wanted to buy some litecoin with it today....or I think I do. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:00:51
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:32:32
Trusted is pretty much what I'm looking for.  It's why I'm using coinbase to buy
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:37:04
Is there interest or anything associated with a cc purchase for the Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:58:51
I plan to. I but I fully expect some stupid fluctuations over the next week or two and if I can take advantage and buy even more to hold for a yr or two that's a much better situation to be in.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:59:46
Sorry guys, it's me!
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:41:23
So basically I bought at 16000. If it hits 15500 at some point today I want to sell and put it in litecoin. I can put in a stop order for the full amount of bitcoin I'm willing to dump and enter in the dollar amount I want bitcoin to be worth when I want to dump it, even if that means the price must go higher, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:01:02
What's the difference between that and Gemini/Exodus?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:13:19
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:33:13
I bought at 15k and 16k for the first time ever.  I'm watching it drop as we speak. I fully expected this to go down, wasn't sure how much though.  I never would have bought if I didn't think 15k and 16k has the possibility of going much higher.  BUTTTT, boy is it a roller coaster already.  This is fun.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:46:20
Thanks guys.  Gonna go feel stupid for a while.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:11:38
Can funds on coinbase be approved during the weekend?  I made deposits same day at different times and only one was approved yesterday.  Can the other be approved before sunday?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:46
That's what I figured and man that shit would be fun. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:00:23
cnbc is great for everything unrelated to cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:21:24
The next correction is right around the corner.
Or is it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:02:30
That's where I'm at.  Do I buy when it clears or just wait to see if it drops 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:04:49
Is there way to put in a sell if btc hits a certain price on coinbase?  If it hits a certain price I want to sell half and buy some litecoin.  If tomorrow it crashes even more Ill buy back in with other money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:35:37
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:27:15
i did mean gdax.  that's where my btc is.  basically what i was asking is if there's a way to put in an order so that if btc goes closer to my buying cost(which is  16000) so that im not losing as much i can sell there.  that's all.  i'm not exactly playing with a lot of money here.  lessons can be learned.  just asking some questions. 
i'd rather split my money and buy more if it crashes tomorrow.  I also want to buy some litecoin as well.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:58:02
got my ledger nano this morning
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:55:57
There she goes.  She's tanking, hodl fast boys.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:13:11
That's a really good idea.  I need to do that.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:35:36
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:07:21
Got it.  Thanks guys!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:56:58
Will people be able to buy futures for litecoin tomorrow or is it just bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:21:05
How the fuck does coinbase have Bitcoin so much higher than bitcointicker?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:51:18
If I sell my bitcoin on gdax is it immediately available to buy litecoin, or more bitcoin tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:12:43
I thought gemini was a wallet.  Brb, time to do way more research. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:13:12
Coinbase is always way more than what it's going on gdax.  I hate that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:56:54
Do you know if gdax is the same as coinbase in terms of if they lose your usd it's backed?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:41:37
This is the hard part.  I was ready to buy at 9k.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:26:55
fucking coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:12:37
How different were your names?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:00
I treated it like a traditional investment and moved money into the account and have been waiting for it to clear to make the purchase.  Good to know. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:00:46
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:34:40
So basically I bought at 16000.  If it hits 15500 at some point today I want to sell and put it in litecoin.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:57
It's so annoying actually.  It's a major turnoff as a first timer.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:45
Can I cancel a pending deposit with coinbase?  They suck right now from everything that I'm hearing now it's taking forever to complete the deposit and after everything I'm hearing I def don't want to use them to buy my first bitcoins 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:16:29
That's my question.  The whole thing seems shady and Bitcoin seems to be the perfect way to do that.
