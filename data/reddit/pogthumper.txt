You realize HTML markup eliminates double spaces, right?  Seeing as how you communicate over it 8 hours a day?

After taking this long, here's my prediction for the announcement:

So when you talk to some people, you'll pretend to be an illiterate buffoon, but then when you talk to other people you put on your intelligent hat?  If you can do the latter, something tells me you won't be writing like that e-mail without a concentrated effort.

Double spaces after periods is not rare or weird at all, and is standard in several places including the Air Force (which is where I picked it up from).  While it's considered incorrect, it happens quite often.
I actually do it here on reddit too but it automatically replaces them with a single space.

I dunno... I'm pretty well-versed in Bitcoin, but if someone said Satoshi Nakamoto in real life conversation I wouldn't immediately think Bitcoin.  Can't see a beat cop doing more than trying to not be awkward.
Reporter - "He's Satoshi Nakamoto!  The creator of Bitcoin!"
Cop - "Oh yea yea, I've heard of that."

Ehhh... for someone who could produce sentences and words like that found in the whitepaper would have to go through considerable, deliberate effort to produce the letter on the left.

Lol exactly.  Have you ever had to lie to your girlfriend about where you were, with everything on the line?  You'd be talkin about communicating with the bitcoins as well.
