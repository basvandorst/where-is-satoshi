Take a picture of yourself with a paper that says r/bitcoin. Theres no way some 80 yr old man is on reddit talking about bitcoins and the great depression.

If it is set up like in the US, the shops have no affiliation with it, they are just posing as the middle man. Likely they won't even know what bitcoin is.

You will pay that fee once. In traditional banking you will pay it over and over again. Buying with cash is a huge convenience, no bank reversals, freezing or meddling. and Localbitcoin, the other in person competitor, usually has a 10 % premium.

I wonder if AlbertBitcoin is going to grab one.

Look at the chart, has any price rise in history gone that high that quickly, and didnt collapse?

It only crashed last time due to Gox lag

Any proof of this? You might just be trying to cause FUD

Too bad he is clearly a 20 yr old role playing. He is talking like how a young person thinks old people talk. "in my day, blah blah, great depression, you whippersnappers are onto something"
