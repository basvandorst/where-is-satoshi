@_date: 2016-08-05 12:41:41
I have a question for you: what will you do when no one gets their money back? Will you continue to work for Bitfinex?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:58:59
How much money do you have on there? You should post proof of how much you had before the hack and proof of your balance after the haircut, because, why tge fuck should we believe you?
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:54:34
Monero doesnt actively advertise to anybody. In fact, their devs actively encourage people NOT to invest in Monero. However, i do agree with everything else u said
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:32:12
Im flattered that you would trust the honor system for 600 bucks with me, an internet stranger. But i wouldnt trust that amount without some form of escrow. I'll look into multisig. It would be a pretty cool smart contract!
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:09:46
I love BTC dearly. But its for all the stuff you just mentioned that i also hodl XMR. Crypto must be private at the protocol level if it's to be fungible, and crypto must be fungible if it's to be money. I hope the block size gets resolved soon so development can focus on fungibility

While I hope they catch the thief through any means available, this quote also highlights how very non-fungible BTC is
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:52:01
Yup, privacy matters in life, and its not about illegal or legal. We often hear the "i have nothing to hide so i dont care about privacy" argument. Well, the other day in a thread on the XMR sub someone mentioned how in the early 1900s jews in Poland didnt mind entering their religious affiliation in a registry because "they had nothing to hide". Look how that turned out. Privacy matters! And our finances are nobody's business. I think p2p mixing is awesome, but what we really need is default privacy at the protocol level
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:22:15
Fungibility matters, and we aint got it, at least not yet.
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:52:46
I agree, although at this very moment theres huge volume on xmr
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:55:39
Definitely this! I think Bitsquare is one of the most awesome things to happen in crypto in a while. Lets show them some love/traffic and take food out if the mouths of all these crooked assholes who constantly steal our money.

Actually theres an exchange based in the UK where u can trade pounds for XMR and back. However, they are tiny and pounds are the only fiat so far. Once ringCT gets implemented into XMR, it will be possible to have multisig, at which point Bitsquare will also have a fiat/XMR pair
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:30:32
I believe that once ringCT gets implemented (i think its already on test phase) even the amounts themselves will be obfuscated. Im very non technical so maybe someone can explain ringCT bettter

I think one common way is to trade btc for xmr on shaoeshift.io, then back to btc. Im not sure if you'd end up paying more or less in fees than sending them to coinjoin, which is another option
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:53:09
Would you be interested in betting on those assumptions? Pick a timeline longer than a year and I'll bet u any amount of money up to two BTC that Monero will hava a market cap twice the size of the cap at the time the wager is booked. Pick a timeline longer than two years and I'll bet you up to two BTC that monero will have a market cap four times the size of the cap at the time the wager is booked. Choose a timeline longer than three years and we can negotiate the terms of the bet. For settlement we could make the bet into its own thread here and see if someone can come up with a multisig scheme in exchange for a percentage of the money pool. (I think someone successfully came up with such a scheme as an experiment for bets on online chess games) . If nothing else it would be an interesting experiment on the use cases of multisig
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:54:17
This is great. Ive always loved mycelium. Whats tge difference between something like this and something like coinjoin?

I think u know that the vast majority of affected users will get mere farthings back compared to the overall loss. Imo, you're in real risk of going down in crypto history as a Mark Karpeles or a Craig Wright. That would suck, since you still got a long way to go. You can fix it if you quit now and let those incompetent assholes speak for themselves

What exactly is the concern? I'm a bit confused
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:06:41
For real! Id expect several thousands. (I have high hopes for both btc and xmr)
Edit: thats why the honor systen is out of the question, as it could turn into the biggest bet if our lives and it would be foolish to trust a stranger. It would be very intersting if it turned into the biggest bet ever settled through what would basically be a smart contract! Pretty cool. 
How bout this: when all this bitfinex drama dies down on the main page, I'll make a post explaining our bet. To incentivize someone to design the contract we could offer, say, 8% of the total wager? 8% would be a considerable sum if in 2020 one BTC is like 10k usd or something.

I'm no shrink, but if chronic narcissism is a mental disorder then he def has that. 
His ego is also sensitive to the point that it seems pathological (again i'm not a shrink, but the only people I've seen with such thin skin are children who have a lot of social maturing to do still). He seems to get bent out of shape for very trivial things. For example, he made a huge deal over the turnout for the inauguration being smaller than Obama's. Obama was the first black president, so one should expect more people as it was a historical first. But more importantly, who the hell cares?? 
I feel concerned when the POTUS is someone who can't take jokes or criticism. People who are so sensitive to the words of others can be gamed pretty easily, which is worrying if he's the leader of your country.

i dont know how totalitarian the rule of the alpha male was for early man. but i wanna say not very. In the Great Plains, for example, the title of chief in tribes like the Sioux and Cheyenne, was a very loose title indeed. Most plains tribes existed as collections of smaller bands. If u were chief it really just meant u had a nack for finding the best camping sites or could track buffalo well, etc. but if the tribesmen and women felt u sucked at that stuff, no hard feelings, they just splintered off into a new band, or joined another one. Exit strategy was the most common form of political dissent, and it never really encountered violent resistance. Of course, plains indians were generally a very very laid back bunch.

If u can control your own money with a simple paraphrase and send the money across the world without a third party needed, the need for banks is greatly diminished. Please explain to me, why would banks want such a system to.succeed? Seriously, explain to us why

As far as a situation of mass adoption causing the system to clog up, we must remember there are other cryptos. Monero for instance, doesn't have a block size issue at all. If people are truly desperate to.move their fiat into bitcoin, it's likely they'll also look into other cryptos. That why it's a good idea to hold some ltc xmr and ether. Honestly, they're so cheap that it really can't hurt to.own a couple hundred of each

Actually, yes! And i say this being a pussy myself. Society has been largely pussified. There was a time, and it wasn't too long ago, when even men of privileged positions would usually rather die than break their word/balls/principles/beliefs. For instance, even the "rich kid" Kennedy brothers volunteered for suicide missions in WWII, and say what u will about their politics, they certainly weren't pussies.

Hello. You sound like you might be new to crypto. Welcome. You're experiencing a common problem during times of high volume in transactions. The blocks are fuller so there's more fee competition. Blocks get full pretty easy when there's a lot of volume. This is a flaw in Bitcoin. But don't let it discourage you. There are other cryptos, like Monero, which have flexible block sizes which bloat and shrink depending on the volume. Crypto is awesome
@_date: 2016-06-27 02:44:19

Hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger (also paper wallets) allow you to control your own private keys. If you have your money on an exchange like Coinbase then they control your private keys. They have a saying around here: "If you don't own your keys you don't own the bitcoin". Many people have lost fortunes in Bitcoin because they had money in an exchanges when that exchange got hacked or exit scammed or what have you. Btw, hardware wallets and paper wallets are not that hard to use. and there's plenty of good guides out there that show you how to use them. You'll feel better when you control your own money. Be your own bank!

thank you for the helpful link. Sorry for another noob question: 
When i set up my trezor, i didn't use a password or passphrase. Just picked a passcode and stored the seed. I've noticed some wallets say that picking a password encrypts the back-up seed. Is my trezor back-up insecure if i don't have a password for trezor?
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:37:11
the thing about trezor is that it's a little pricey. There are viable options out there for cold storage that are cheaper. Other than that it's extremely user friendly and it's hard to put a price on peace of mind

i'd never heard of this site. Looks interesting. They do everything through Coinbase. It says if you connect your coinbase account to bit by bit, the bit by bit will be able to:
View your balance
View receive addresses and create new ones
Buy bitcoin
Debit money from your account 
Max. 50.00 USD per day
Request money from your account
View your basic account information
some of these seem kinda invasive. What do they mean by request money from account or debit money from it, or buy bitcoin?

Imo, the BTC community has to get over that aspect of the social contract. A negligible tail emission is not the boogeyman many think it is. I feel like many people equate it with reckless central bank money printing. Not only is a tail emission small, its even smaller when you factor in all the coins people lose over time just misplacing passwords, etc

@_date: 2015-11-12 04:39:42
that's very interesting. Tell me if i got this right: so the guys at Blockstream all put a bunch of their BTC away in one place, and in such a way that they can't spend those coins for a long time. This way they are motivated to work hard at improving the ecosystem so that when the time comes to be able to spend those coins there will be a healthy BTC economy in place? If that's correct i gotta say it's pretty freaking cool. It's like some sort of Lord of the Rings pact or something. (excuse my getting nerdy about it)

this reminds me of a thing they tried in switzerland. They decriminalized ALL drug use, and built state-run centers where addicts can actually go do their drugs! these places provide a clean environment and clean needles. There are also mirrors everywhere, so addicts can see how unhealthy they look. On the top floor of the facilities there are drug rehab centers. They pay for these centers with money that would have gone to persecuting and charging those same users. The result has been quite a noticeable decline in drug use. I think other countries (Canada?) have run similar experiments with good results.

I don't think you'll get downvoted because you're asking good questions. You're also wise to ask these questions before u actually get invested. There's a lot to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It's definitely a rabbit hole.
The thing that attracted me to Bitcoin is that i can send value anywhere in the world without permission or middlemen. U can be in china and u can send me your bitcoin address and i can send you any amount of money and nobody can tell me shit. No bank or goverment is gonna ask me any questions and nobody is gonna charge me fees for converting dollars to yuan or what have you. To me, thats beautiful. It's liberating and empowering. No government can come along and inflate away the value of bitcoin by printing a bunch of it either. That's amazing.

Like I said, the developer of bitsquare, the decentralized exchange, is very much intent of implementing xmr into the list of coins. The Oye reason he hasn't yet is that xmr's cryptography is way different from all the other coins on that exchange. So there will eventually be at least one fiat xmr pair

@_date: 2016-05-22 16:53:17
Too small, and there's no fiat/monero pair in any exchange, so the extra conversion (fiat to btc to xmr) is a deterrent. However that will change overtime. For example, the developer of Bitsquare loves monero, and will eventually implement it. That will be the first fiat/xmr pair. I definitely predict xmr taking a chunk of btc's dark market share. That makes xmr an obvious way to diversify one's crypto stash

suppose the ecosystem grew enough that even if a lot of merchants and service providers blacklisted coins there would still exist a closed loop economy of merchants and service providers that accepted all coins, possibly made up of decentralized stuff like Open Bazaar.

you know, i feel like perhaps the physical act of scanning someone's QR code with your phone and sending this peculiar form of money to their phone has a sense of intimacy that might be psychologically more impressive than say, changetip. (I love changetip, don't get me wrong.) I think phones are almost part of our bodies in a way. We're on them at the dinner table with our families! So gifting someone BTC from your phone to theirs is symbolic. Like a futuristic greeting of sorts. 
anyway, i grind small stakes bitcoin poker. i have a day job too, so i think as an experiment i'm going to use some of my poker earnings to announce events at a local university where i will give $1 away to whatever few hundred people that come up to me with a btc wallet on their phone.

I have about six coins on coinbase and i've been meaning to move them into cold storage. the problem is that i'm not tech savvy in the slightest. i have no idea how to do this. I'm worried something like this could happen. or that i'll get hacked or something. how do i go about saving my coins? i'm super poor so it would suck if i lost them. thanks you in advance for any instructions. 
one more thing: i don't know anything about how btc works. I'm just mystified by it, inexplicably, that's why i have six coins even tho i'm only a part time sandwich artist. i don't even know exactly what a private key is.

I believe in the technology but it ain't gonna work out if regular dumb asses like me are afraid of it. 
for example, i've heard people mention here that it's dangerous to keep using the same address over and over. well, as long as that's the case, widespread adoption just ain't happening. it's gotta be easier than that. i think we can get to that point eventually but we don't seem to be anywhere near it.

Dude, you're gonna get burned it you keep crypto with them. And honestly, considering how easy it is to hold your own crypto it doesnt make any sense to let them hold it, even if they are kosher (i doubt they are). Good luck to you

I've always been skeptical about the field of journalism, but since I've been in crypto I've learned to take all journalism with increasingly bigger grains of salts. Boulders by this point.

This is about ripple though. I'm talking about monero (xmr)

Also people don't realize just how insanely scarce bitcoins are. First off there's a couple million sitting in satoshi's stash which prob won't move for years so they're pretty much out of play. Then there's prob at another million that's been lost, especially since in the early days people were very careless with passwords, etc. Who knows, maybe there's two million lost. And more are lost everyday. We are talking about an extremely rare asset. Bitcoin is like the freaking ghost orchid of money. If everyone suddenly wakes up and decides they want a single bitcoin, we could see prices in the tens of thousands, and even that might be conservative. That's why for those of us who are poor and only managed to save a handful of coins, I say just be patient and hodl, cuz over the long term that's all you need

Well a gradual decline is preferable, and there are coins that have implemented this.

Imo privacy has to happen at the protocol level. I think that the real fungibility crisis for BTC is yet to come. I also think that coins based on the CryptoNote protocol have elegantly solved the fungibility issue

@_date: 2016-07-03 18:50:37
Yup, imo the only solid crypto projects are BTC and XMR. I think XMR is a lot different than most of these alts. No instamine, good governance, and the market cap isn't propped up by a handful of guys holding most of the coins from some presale/instamine etc.

When you say the alt party is not over, do you mean Bitcoin will go back to owning 80%+ of the crypto marketcap from its current 45%?
@_date: 2016-07-24 01:00:41
Would you care to elaborate? How is it not censorship resistant or decentralized?
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:39:54
The only one worth a damn is Monero. It's very asic resistant so it will stave off mining centralization for a long time, maybe indefinitely. It's also the only true fungible coin. Imo, BTC and Monero are the only serious crypto projects out there
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:46:01
XMR is fungible, has privacy at protocol level, has flexible block size and is asic resistant. My crypto stash is half btc and half xmr

The Monero community has a dislike for the pumpiness of most coins out there. We focus on the tech. Of course, the "don't buy monero" thing is more of a meme. Obviously, I've bought Monero. The lead dev, Fluffypony, is always telling people not to buy because he likes to do the opposite of most devs in shitcoins who are always pumping. The other day Fluffypony actually trolled the Monero market and made it crash by announcing an announcement about something big in Monero, and the actual announcement ended up being some trolly video. He did it to make fun of the way other coins announce announcements of ICO's and stuff
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:13:35
This is a possible scenario. Of course, we must constantly have the discipline ro zoom out and have perspective. Bitcoin was 950 bucks or so before new years's day. If by next new year's we're bottoming out at $3k, thats still 200% growth for the year even if it crashed from $10k. 
In crypto, the best way to make money is to accept the fact that you'll frequently make small fortunes and lose them quickly, while knowing that long term you will make money

Me too! And if it was a sound clip i liked Id listen over and over. We have def come a long way

For the reasons you stated, some coins have written into the code a tail emission after all initial coins are mined, so that they will have a little inflation over time. (A one percent inflation is less than one percent when you factor in the coins people lose over time, so it's pretty negligible, yet enough to incentivize the miners and accommodate economic growth)
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:19:27
What does the bill want to do about crypto outside of forcing people to report crypto holdings when traveling? For example, will companies like Coinbase lose their U.S. market?
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:10:06
 Monero's code is such that to build ASIC's for mining it is very difficult. (What exactly makes it difficult is something you'd have to ask of more technically savvy people in the Monero sub.) Basically, to build Monero ASICs would only be worth it if Monero's price is waaaay higher than it is now, and even then who knows if it's still worth it. This bodes well for mining decentralization. 
As for fungibility, Monero uses ring signatures and ringCT to basically make transactions untraceable  
It has other cool features like a dynamic block size which grows and shrinks according to volume, and fees actually go down with increased use! 
EDIT: one last thing: In Monero, we actively tell people to not buy Monero. DON'T BUY MONERO!! Do look into the tech, tho. It's pretty neat. BUT DON'T BUY IT!
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:55:11
Well, you vendors could just adopt Monero. It's private so ut eliminates the need for tumblers, the blocksize is dynamic, not fixed, and fees actually decrease with increased volume
