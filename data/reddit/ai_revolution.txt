2017, silver global reserves : 530,000
2017 mine production : 25,000
Divided = 21.2 years.

That's the attitude. Make enemies of allies.

So Bitcoin is leading in developing cross chain consensus? 
Once up and running, will this make bitcoin a side chain of the alt community? 
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:54:17
Currently, Gold is the preferred safe haven. Other safe havens will kick in later. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:26:15
Against precious metals. BTC to Gold etc
@_date: 2018-10-11 18:56:00
Yes I did !

Staking blockchains are also getting started. Since some of them don't have centralised mining behind the Great Wall of Fire, it could be argued, they are catching up on Bitcoin's so called security advantage.

USDT just dropped to 0.93 ?

A decentralised deflationary global cryptocurrency, that doesn't waste electricity, would speed up the undermining of the wasteful capitalism model. Bitcoin hodlers might of given up the ghost, forward thinkers haven't. Silver consuming Ai can streamline and speedup this forth industrial revolution. Silver bullion will save the day

Centralised mining, mostly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, means China could protect itself against Bitcoin and so defend her Yuan and the future digital currency backed by state's gold reserves, and so market.

Cboe futures expire this week. Usually a sharp sell down just before.

As the collapse occurs, paper manipulation of precious metals end. Silver underground reserves are around 12-20 years and then it's gone.
Bitcoin mining reserves are over a hundred years. As much as Bitcoin will benefit from the collapse, a polyanna viewpoint could miss opportunities. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:18:43
Current mining is around 11 to 1 to gold. Current price, over 80 to 1.
Cost of mining is now above it's current price.
Peak oil, where more energy is used to obtain a barrel of oil, than is contained in a barrel of oil will make current mining practices of mining obsolete. 
Humans, to avoid our extinction, we have 12 years to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees of heating. This means ramping up renewable energy, increasing the consumption of silver. This will probably reduce current silver reserves down from the 20 years, to possibly 10.

Doesn't the other cryptocurrencies also offer this. Some with lower fees, some quicker?

Double spending due to the Chinese firewall time difference makes Bitcoin extremely vulnerable.

China Now Has The Power To Destroy Bitcoin 
Just because you invest ignorantly, doesn't mean I make things up. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:13:51
Dominance? A store of value against physical gold. A currency against the USD. Transaction speed against Visa/Mastercard. Where is this dominance you speak of?
When one looks hard at grandma Bitcoin, she's vulnerable. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:45:46
Hit and a miss. Bitcoin is vulnerable due the the great firewall time delay. Double spending collapses Bitcoin's proposition that it's PoW is the most secure consensus method.
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:30:36
Western Democracy decline, not human. The rest of the world is preparing for the forth industrial revolution. AI will also require extra silver bullion !
@_date: 2018-10-12 06:23:11
Where as the Chinese Communist Party could enact a double spend behind the firewall.

11/11 falls on a weekend. A reset is more likely at the weekend.

They didn't ask my forecast. 1 Bitcoin = 10 ounces of Physical Silver.

Ai machine learning on a decentralised blockchain is the fourth industrial revolution. Roubini thinks Blockchain is the most overhyped technology ever. History will not be kind to his opinion.

China's, and other nations like Russia, their massive physical gold reserves could be the bases of a digital currency used knock off the USD. Launching it could be the time China attacks Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:35:50
1980's silver high multiplied by the global debt increase since= $50 x 22X = $1,100, currently less than $15.
Bitcoin x 22 = $145K. Times 3 ($15 -&gt;50) = $435K
The majority of investors would be more likely to invest into physical silver since they don't know how to obtain and store bitcoin. Correct? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:12:18
Remove bitcoin and type in gold/fiat/dollar, same outcome.
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:54:19
Russia, China, and some other nations are looking into digitalising their physical gold so to use to replace the US dollar in global trade. India joining seems a logical step considering they have over 500 tonnes in reserve and are part of the silk road project.
@_date: 2018-10-12 06:07:09
A premise revealed as correct this week. Bitcoin sold down so people could run to physical Gold. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 08:28:46
China, as in the Communist Party of China. It can cause double spending, so destroying Bitcoin's security, because of the Chinese firewall. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:43:02
The smart money has fled to physical precious metals. A better store of value over USDT, so to wait for $3K Bitcoin. 
Fighting talk ?   
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:52:46
Fiat relies on the illusion it holds value. 
Would you transfer your total wealth into the Venezuela Bolivar Mark2?
The powers of China, Russia etc are planning on digitising their Gold reserves and using this digital currency for global trade. This collapses the USD and all the excess dollars returning home will drive US hyperinflation.
A replacement currency would be extremely weak.
