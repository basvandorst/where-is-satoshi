Great article on the RibbitRewards™!! This is such a great use for blockchain technology to get it out into the mainstream, and with the ribbit.me marketplace, all digital currencies are going to be given utility and a place to be used to purchase items!

We're so psyched to have the guys from giphy.com on board - They've been an amazing help and really help bring us into the Tech world!

Here's a little bit about each of them!
Alex Chung is CEO of Giphy as well as works with Betaworks in New York.  Previously, he made Artspace, The Fridge (Purchased by Google), MTV Music and managed research programs for Paul Allen’s R&amp;D lab. He’s an awesome guy with a passion for all things tech and Jui-Jitsu, so don’t mess with him.
Adam Leibsohn is COO of the seemingly unstoppable startup Giphy.  His background was as Director of Communications Strategy at the New York-based ad agency, Anomaly, before leaving that all behind to pursue his own business ideas as Founder &amp; CEO of startup, voyurl, a platform that uses your under-utilized data exhaust to effortlessly fuel content recommendation and great personal analytics.
