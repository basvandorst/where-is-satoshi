Because there is no central reserve to inject new bitcoin into the economy, there is an algorithm in the bitcoin protocol that deploys bitcoin at a fixed amount per block as a mining reward. 
It began at 50 bitcoin per block in January 2009, and halves approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks). It’s currently at 12.5 bitcoin per mined block and will decrease to 6.25 bitcoin somewhere around May 2020. About 82% of all the bitcoin that will ever be created has already been mined.

Me too; I will never have enough fiat to convert into bitcoin to ever make a ton of money from price increase even if it moons. I’m fine with that, I just want to have a chunk always in reserve, and spend portions when it is convenient. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:05:03
Sorry, but I found your Medium article extremely confusing. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:15:01
Thanks for your analysis. Of all the podcast you mentioned the only one that I am familiar with is the LTB podcast. I would pretty much agree with everything you said about that one. 
The only other ones that I have subscribed to in the past are the Unchained podcast by Laura Shin, The Bad Crypto Podcast, and Crypto 101. I’m not really into these ones anymore they were more interesting to me when I was brand new in the space. Also, I get a very limited selection through the Apple podcast app,which is the only place I have bothered searching for podcasts. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 02:57:33
I did exactly that recently. The passphrase acting as a 13th seed word is an awesome feature.

@_date: 2018-05-11 09:58:14
I wonder about this a lot too. What proportion of the BTC supply has been lost forever? Would it be wrong if there was a mechanism put in place to somehow re-create lost bitcoin so that the circulating supply would remain 21 million? 
But I suppose there’s no way to know whether any given private key is truly lost, or simply hasn’t been used yet.
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:55:09
Yeah like the state, for instance!

Other full nodes could reject these kind of moves as they would violate the protocol. Profound changes like you mention would necessitate a hard fork, I would think.

I upgraded my Protonmail account with bitcoin today, just because I could, that was cool. It was the bitcoin payment option in Protonmail that caught my eye back in April, and got me curious about looking into bitcoin to learn more about it. Got hooked immediately, and I've been reading as much as I can ever since.
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:47:34
Yep, every time the price dips, it’s bargain purchase time!

Yep, me too, I just completed my first Shakepay bitcoin purchase a few days ago, it took about 20 minutes from intial purchase to bitcoin in my wallet. The Interac e\-transfer method is a great workaround, and very fast!

Yeah mine doesn’t get crypto at all. I just don’t bring it up. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:12:55
Yeah I know but it’s feels kind of weird having the base unit of your currency like 1* 10^-20 units or whatever. Which is what they’re going to have to subdivide this shit down into after the price skyrockets in 5 to 10 years.

I’ve seen a lot of people try to calculate that number, and it’s kind of depressing; Satoshi’s supply possibly may never move, and there may be a few million other bitcoins that are just lost due to ineptitude and error. There’s the famous case of Wired magazine who destroyed their 13 bitcoin which is worth something  $130,000 today. Although that’s not a lot of bitcoin, granted. I don’t understand why the limit was set so freaking low, 21 million bitcoin seems like a small total for the state of Maine let alone the entire planet.

True, Coinbase is one of the easier methods to buying and selling, but I think u/IndianaGeoff's point still stands. Until someone like my mom can understand it without having to watch 20 videos from Andreas on YouTube, you are going to see adoption stalled and only increase among the techno\-elite.
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:13:43
Yep, I bought a little bit in the recent dip, not very much, but all I could swing at the moment. It’s like when the price goes down, you win: you can buy cheaper BTC. When the price goes up, you win, higher value.

I don’t get why the Daily Discussion exists. If the purpose of it is to filter out repetitive content from the main page, it’s allowing too many topics to be effective.

Sorry to be dense, but does your own transaction *necessarily* get validated by your own node, or is it randomly assigned to one of your connected nodes?

@_date: 2018-06-18 00:48:46
Yeah until you mentioned it, I hadn’t even considered that I didn’t check the price all day.A lower price means I can buy more bitcoin, and a higher price means I have more value. As far as I’m concerned, I can’t lose.
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:34:17
Isn’t a full node able to validate blocks and connect to other nodes without also participating in mining?
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:17:50
You also have to take into account the opportunity cost of not continuing walking or pursuing another activity during those 3 to 5 seconds, and in addition to that there is also the social cost of the humiliation of being seen stooping to pick up a penny.

I wonder why, if \~2MB blocks are possible, the miners didn't include more transactions in the block, given that so much more money could have been made?
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:01:08
Thanks for the hints. There aren't any tor connections yet. I'll check that periodically. I tried testing the IPs of nodes that are connected to mine, and I get the same throttling error, so it looks like you are right.
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:44:45
Thanks for your work for this update! I tried my hand at upgrading my full node from a 16.0 binary install to the 16.2 source code installation; no problems encountered.
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:03:17
Ok, I followed those instructions, using method 1 described in the link. Is there any way to tell if I set up the Tor hidden service correctly?
Edit: Checking on [bitnodes]( I can see my node on the network map, and when I look up my node's IP [here]( bitnodes reports that the node is up and running. However, when I enter the IP and port 8333 into the 'check node' dialog box on the main bitnodes page, I get an error message "Request was throttled". I get the same error when I try to check my onion address.  Neither does my onion address show up when explicitly searched for with the [bitnodes search tool](
My debug.log shows that the Tor connection was successful and my onion address was created:
`tor: Successfully connected!`
`tor: Connected to Tor version` [`0.3.3.7`](
`tor: Authentication successful`
`tor: ADD_ONION successful` 
`tor: Got service ID` *idname*`, advertising service` *idname*`.onion:8333`
[Canyouseeme ]( reports that port 8333 is open on my node's IP.
I can confirm from bitcoin-qt that network traffic in and out look normal, and 16 clients are currently connected. What would be the cause of the throttling error on bitnodes? I've tried several times over the past hour with the same results.

Yes I tried this option the other day when moving some BTC between my Greenwallet and Bitcoin node wallet. I was able to set a pretty low fee by just watching the mempool and the current transaction fees. It's a nice option.

@_date: 2018-07-18 02:24:44
Wouldn't the increasing difficulty and decreasing block reward act as an incentive for the miners to take some ASICs offline to reduce costs? Then the total hashrate drops, difficulty (at some point) gets reduced, forming this nice negative feedback loop. One would assume that an equilibrium would be established between hashrate, difficulty, and block reward, at any BTC market price - unless maybe there are other factors I'm not taking into account?
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:38:04
I gave it a shot - starting up a full node isn’t that hard as the installation instructions on bitcoin.org are really well written. The syncing the blockchain part took about a week for me. I have yet to see how much the power bill is, but I honestly don’t really care as I believe in the technology of bitcoin and the philosophy behind it. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:40:55
