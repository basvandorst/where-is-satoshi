Its not stored in a single wallet but in slices of 1000 or 10000 BTC. He could give away one smaller lost wallet and the corrupted private key as test data and provide another big wallet as a bounty that can be claimed by providing the source code used to brute force.

I lost 8.5 BTC
Mtgox was the first exchange that I invested in. I was there when they got hacked and the price went down to 10 cents. But they paid everyone and raised security precautions. They bought another hacked exchange and paid out its customers some months later. I really trusted them to fix their problems once again and felt safe.

So here it is: an Google docs spreadsheet where anyone can put his username and account balance in. It's unprotected, so maybe someone comes up with a better idea and can copy the signups. 
Put your money where your mouth is!
