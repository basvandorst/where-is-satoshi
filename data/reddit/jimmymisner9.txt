Cannot upvote enough. I've been trying to day trade the past couple days and my bitcoin balance has gone down about 8%. Shoulda hodl'd. If you're new, the only thing you really should be doing is hodling. Unless you have a solid understanding of technical analysis and are very good at predicting large, short moves. And even then, classical technical analysis is woefully inadequate when applied to bitcoin. You'd honestly get more mileage out of studying price walls.

Was on the fence between trading and just holding through 20,000, my decision to hodl has been made

The market value does not change based on limit orders, it changes based on market orders. For more information on how the price of bitcoin is determined see [here](

That's the primary problem I see with bitcoin as a currency. A currency needs to be able to be adapted to a changing economy, which almost always means gradual inflation, as long as an economy is growing steadily. Without at least slight inflation, there would never be any motivation to buy non-essential products, because you could simply save your money and buy a lot more with it at a later date down the road. As much as inflation is derided in this sub, a small amount of it is actually necessary to keep the economy from contracting. While I don't see bitcoin ever being used universally, I do think it's possible that an alt could be used universally if it were somehow able to inflate or deflate itself based on changing economic conditions.

Absolutely nothing until your sell price is reached, at which point you make a very small profit

Market orders process at whatever the "best market price" is. That could be anywhere between the current listed price and the next highest ask price.

IMO that's not really enough to justify moving it out of the exchange, unless you're planning on doin ur btc a long term hodl. Also I'm a noob so I'm sure someone else will come in with something more intelligent than this

You can use stop orders to set an upper and lower limit for selling or buying

This transaction wouldn't actually be executed until the price reached 500k. The stop is basically specifying what your acceptable loss is - with a stop buy order, you're basically saying "I don't think the price of bitcoin is going to go up, but if it reaches 18k, I will automatically buy so my "loss" from not buying earlier is limited." With a stop sell order, it's the other side - "If the price of bitcoin goes down to 16k, I'll sell so as to limit my loss."

Ya can't do that because the smallest unit of a bitcoin is already a satoshi

A good and very visible example of limit orders and how they can be used are price walls, where in order to break through to the next bid or ask, every limit order at that price level must be filled. Limit orders don't cause the price to go up or down but can certainly provide a lot of resistance to movement, like they're doing right now on GDAX.

A-fricken-men, I'm not buying back until I see a reversal pattern.

However, I do think the finite nature of bitcoin makes it a great store of value, similar to gold. I can see people using bitcoin down the line in retirement portfolios once the price increases more gradually and predictably.
