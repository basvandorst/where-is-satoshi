Honestly I think kitchen sink coin is going to be the next big thing. It has 52 flavours of hashing algorithm and ROT13 to boot. No other coin has ROT13.

Because Bitcoin can be exchanged for money it can be used to launder money seems to be the ruling in a nutshell.

What is to stop an entity from creating a new address after solving each block?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:38:05
Lol @ end of bitcoin. Bitcoin hasn't even started yet. The protocol had not been broken

Seems legit.

It is skyrocketing because it's been skyrocketing. The money sitting on the sidelines has decided it is time to get back on board.

haha yes it did. Crack dealers always have the cleanest clothes.

You can buy socks with bitcoin? Jesus I have my life savings, that I made through tax evasion, waiting for this day!

You cannot make a transaction without a internet connected device. All transactions are published on the internet and are public record, this is the blockchain.

Well the last couple weeks or so.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:16:04
I will agree to disagree. Since you have offered a straw man there can be no discussion here.
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:13:30
With the current administration at least. *sigh*

It's a terrible thing but a corpse is a fascinating thing and try as we might it is hard to turn our gaze. I agree everyone needs to take a moment to understand the pain of those who placed their hopes and dreams in the hands of the incompetent and suffered.

If this were true the price would far exceed 2K.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:07:46
What? This happened in a free market.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:53:20
I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:16:32
I have been considering the same scenario. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:17:40
No they aren't. The coins are in the ledger.

Back during the dot com boom there were all these local cafe's and eateries that sprung up around our business and I revisited the neighborhood in 2001 and it was a ghost town of shutdown cafe's and businesses struggling to hold on. Very sad it was.

Particularily people who are older who spent their whole lives saving for retirement. Who want's to risk a lifetime of work and savings?

Perhaps its just payday when most enthusiasts buy a little. I noticed I'm usually better holding off until just before payday to buy.

Sure enough on the day I was going to walk over to buy.

0.00005% per day at current difficulties or 1 every 2 million days (5000 years). Strangely enough if you play the lotto every week your odds of hitting the top prize are almost exactly the same. This estimate is insanely optimistic back of the envelope calculation.

Perhaps not today but it's been on the march all month with no sign of slowing down so we shall see.

This. There are no coins in a wallet only keys that can unlock them.

The Bitcoin are in the blockchain which is replicated on every computer that runs a wallet. To make Bitcoin disappear one would have to erase the data from all the nodes and any backups that may exist. Short of a cataclysmic cosmic accident this is just not going to happen.
Causing all Bitcoins to disappear would not benefit anyone. That would be in the realm of Dr Evil. 
Bitcoin is transparent and it is exactly what it says it is. Those who have the capability have audited and examined it thoroughly and have stated as much. Keep doing your research and you should be able to come to the same conclusion. You are giving into fear of the unknown. Seriously take the time to understand what it is and how it works because it is really neat. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:23:23
Well the talk is that it is the time of weeding out. The companies that survived ran a tighter ship and the professionals stepped in to take over the money farms. Not my words, I just listen and make things happen.

People have been crying doom forever. 
The common wisdom is that you can be riskier as a young person with your portfolio but the closer you are to retirement the harder it is to replace and you start moving toward investment with less risk.

It is similar enough that old time poker industry leaders, since displaced, discuss it at length.

I would not shift more than 10% of my funds into a high risk investment. I would be all over the chance to buy a registered security backed by bitcoin. Where I live there would be an opportunity to do this and withdraw any capital gains tax free should I choose.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:31:00
That is not a good sign.

Are there any Canadian banks that are not hostile toward Bitcoin businesses?
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:58:47
A wallet is the software that manages your BTC and it will contain many key pairs as it will be managing many addresses.
An address is the public portion of a public/private key pair. You can share the address with someone that wants to send you funds but you need the private portion if you want to send those funds out later. 
So they are in fact different some people use the terms loosely. 
If you wanted to make a bunch of paper wallets to hand out at a convention you would likely want to use the feature to generate 100 wallets at once.

You are going to hate me but gold is gold. A method of rendering cryptography useless dissipates all bitcoin value instantaneously.

Beautiful work. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:02:58
If you have the private key you cannot loose the public key because the public key is derived from it. If you only have the private key you can recreate the public key associated with it.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:54:16
Hmm I think the real story is that they accept only bitcoins. Nothing like an exclusive to force people to switch.
