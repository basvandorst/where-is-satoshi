Please just stop posting Greece news here. 
It has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Just stop it. It's been enough. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:57:45
Funny. When you mention it's about the money you people go nuts, tell you it's about helping Greece and downvote you to hell. 
And why the hell would the price if Bitcoin go up because of Greece?
And the price never went up because of Cyprus. This is a myth created by, you guessed it, Bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:24:45
And i'm just showing how delusional many of you are. Don't like it then don't post here. 
And please stop acting as if this whole Greece thing is anything order than one big pump to get the price up. At least be honest about the reason this shit gets posted non-stop. Everyone knows it's all about the price. Everybody. Every single person here.

How old should his account be before he is allowed to have an opinion you don't like. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 02:02:19
Poe. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:19:00
No it isn't. And it also isn't safer. It's one of the least safe things to put your money in. Get out of fantasy land. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:33:29
You have any idea how dumb that sounds?
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:06:16
No. I'm not paying for anything. The bank gives me money. What part about not paying don't you understand?
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:03:00
Look dude, these people are here to make fun of the crazies in this sub. That's all. Nobody is shitting his pants because of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:14:46
what did i just explain to you about your paranoia? Did you already forget?
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:54:05
Or 1000 other things that are actually useful to them. 
Why do you people just fail to realize that Bitcoin doesn't exist to these people?? They won't be buying coins! They're not even thinking about it. Not once. Just stop with this insane idea that the world outside this sub cares about bitcoins. It's just delusional. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:04:44
Yes we know. And they also won't be buying Bitcoin. So you can stop posting about it here. This is getting completely ridiculous. My god. 
You people are crazy. I never seen anything like it. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:37:30
Riiiiight. Of course. Silly me. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:24:35
What exactly will happen to the Euro on monday?? So you are saying that anyone in the EU is better off holding dollars coming monday? Please explain. I seriously can't wait for your answer. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 02:03:35
Just worth 100 dollars less. 
It's crazy to watch you people. The fantasy you just keep up while knowing better. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 02:08:38
The ATM is free. And the bank pays me to keep my money there. I have no card fee. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:52:46
It scares me how you people straight away go through someone's account as soon as they say something that isn't part of the circle jerk. It really is scary and disturbing behavior. It makes this place look like a cult. 
Especially how you post this to "warn" your fellow cult members. 
Do you consider your behavior normal?
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:45:45
It's been a crisis for 6 months. Stop cherry picking. You're just looking for something you want to see. And a price rise of 5-10 dollars because of Greece is ridiculous. One medium whale trader could do this. 
I'm done answering your nonsense. Get some common sense. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:58:16
Go down how?
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:39:21
Gold is fine. I'm talking about Bitcoin. 
And Bitcoin never went up in times of crisis. No idea where you got that idea from. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:06:49
Why the hell would Bitcoin go up because of Greece?
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:36:16
You people are insane. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:47:38
Someone a few hours ago said Bitcoiners don't care about the price. They just want to help the Greeks. i don't understand your post. Was he wrong? Do Bitcoiners simply want to make money off the Greek tragedy?
Someone suggested in a reply to him that they do and was downvoted to hell. 
So why is your post getting so many upvotes? Confusing. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:33:20
What propagana tactic? Just stop with the paranoia dude. It's just people making fun of Bitcoin or mainly Bitcoiners. The sooner you realize this the better it would be for everyone. 
Nobody is infiltrating here to spread propaganda. Don't be ridiculous. 
That's why his behavior is just scary. It makes you people look like scary cultists. And guess what. That triggers even more people who will make fun of this sub. 
Why don't you people just understand this. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:56:14
I give feedback any way i want. And as long as you behave all paranoid and cultish i will make fun of it and call you out. Don't like it? Then stop doing it. 
As soon as this sub as a whole would stop doing this you'll notice that all the trolling and "propaganda" will stop. But we know this will never happen as this place attracts all the loonies. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 02:06:08
But not you because you are just the ideas guy. Right?
@_date: 2015-06-28 10:02:35
Can you answer me please. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:43:18
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:06:34
And even if they have money they still won't be buying Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:23:21
I imagine you like this right now: fingers in your ears while screaming lalalala i don't hear youuuuu!
It's kinda sad. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:29:02
No. It doesn't prove that all. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:00:31
Huh? They keep telling me here it's not about price. 
That Bitcoiners absolutely are not using the Greek misery of millions to pump the price. 
How odd that you made this post then. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 01:27:05
Why? What would a Greek need Bitcoin for??
