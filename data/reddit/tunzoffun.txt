I can print a receipt from your cash paid hotel stay and give it to the feds.
I can bring up the blockchain and show the feds that as a receipt for your hotel stay too.
Both record the transaction and both provide anonymity.

People were selling to buy Christmas presents. When it started to dip, all the people who were in for quick cash panic sold to afford the best possible Christmas.

Okay so I'm only copying the file for redundancy reasons. If my computer dies I can copy data onto a new client and access it again.
 Or if somebody steals my computer, I can transfer it asap and hope they aren't aware of bitcoin and its value when they boot up my hardware. 
There's no point to knowing passwords and keys. So how does a paper key work? A shortened key is used correct? This key is also printed directly from an offline client, so what is the point of printing it? Why not just leave the file available on the offline client and copy to a thumb drive?
Also, since I can't declare residence due to my age, I can't verify myself to use virtex ...

I'm thinking about purchasing my first bitcoins soon. Maybe blowing about 500$. I'm Canadian, and I'm 17. Some questions I have..
* Where does Canada stand on bitcoins? I see the majority of users coming from the USA or UK.
* Are Bitcoins threatened by the government? If the government outlawed them, prohibiting businesses from accepting them as a payment, would their value fall to 0? We would essentially all be left with bitcoins that nobody would buy, making them a novelty item correct?
* Bitcoins aren't naturally occurring, so did just some guy come up with this and thought it would be a cool idea? How was it implemented? 
* Can you purchase fractions of a bitcoin? Or am I looking at a minimum 200$ to invest right now? 
* Are people under the age of 18 allowed to use bitcoins?
* I came here because of the post on the front page yesterday. Seems like now is the worst time to invest as the market is about to flood with new people, are my economics just terrible?
* Should I be jumping on the bandwagon asap or waiting for the market to crash and then buy a significantly larger amount of bitcoins at say a price around 50$?

So I don't need a private key to send bitcoins to an address, and I can see all addresses ever created... But only the creator of the address knows the private key, which is what you need to withdraw from the address?

I think its important for us all to step back and realize that bitcoin has been valued between 700-900, for the past 5 days. We just survived a massive correction to 400.
I wasn't around for the days of post April to Pre October 2013. But I have been around for the crazy market we've seen this month. A slow, steady increase over the past few days makes me feel pretty damn good about this thing working out.

For cold storage, I can set up one paper wallet, and it will have 0 balance since its never been connected to the internet. I then send bitcoins from my several online wallets to that address, and its stored on the block chain forever. 
I then forget about it correct? I am not to connect my paper wallet, and it will technically remain at 0 balance, but as soon as I connect it to the internet, it will Dowbload the block chain, and update its balance to the total of all transfers ever made. The paper account is now just any other wallet, and I should make my purchase and then transfer all my remaining bitcoins to a new paper wallet thats never been on the internet.

But nobody can access it because the key has never been seen. So no viruses can steal it, it can't get corrupted, but in theory somebody could mash buttons on their keyboard and guess the password, or my girlfriend could grow jealous of my bitcoin investment and murder me and steal my paper.

And you could bypass these coins by simply using a larger transaction fee. Also highly unlikely to send 0.01 coins at a time and theyd likely send around 50. I dont care who this guy is, his btc is good &amp; authentic so others and myself will buy it all up.

Pay attention to buyer reviews and seller reputation, don't purchase high volumes, meet in a public place, and you'll have no issues.

I used quickbt today to give you an idea of the fee. Received instantly, and since ive switched to 40$ a week dollar cost averaging I'm fine with them. Also really enjoy their service and instant delivery for repeat customers.
Bitstamp $552 at purchase time
Purchased 0.06
Paid $38.91
552 (0.06) = $33.12
38.91 - 33.12 = 5.79
5.79 / 38.91 (100) = 14.8%
Also used vault of Satoshi but you have to convert to USD from CAD and the banks will rape you. Expect to lose 6$-10$ per 100. So buying 5000$ worth of bitcoins would require a deposit of about 5400$
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:29:25
Assuming bitcoin is widespread and used everyday by families. It is being used to purchase coffee and pay your hydro bill, and your employer has done away with fiat and simply supplied you with BTC.
I foresee several value crashes. The big players from the beginning days that want out. Flooding markets and crashing value, so that your rent shoots up to quadruple the amount of mBTC it was last month, and we see events similar to the great depression. As bitcoin crashes, more and more people panic sell, and in term crash it more. 
We've accepted this risk in the early years and all know what will happen. But when it becomes available to the average Joe, and modern banks are on board by securing Joe blow non tech savvy peoples paper wallets in deposit boxes. These crashes will harm people. Harm the economy and scare away the adoption of BTC as we revalue the USD as we cash in all our bitcoins. Allowing a few central banks to control the majority of bitcoins, fix their values, and crash them again when they so choose. 
Gold was decentralized too when it just came out of the ground. Don't think the power of the big banks will wither away while we cost them more and more money by switch to BTC. They're going to want in to, and I don't believe the average Joe will always want to secure his wallet 100% and banks will make themselves a part of it.

I'm not saying in the long scheme of things. Just saying that after a crazy 3 weeks of uncertainty. Those five days were about as close as stables going to get for a while.

Been working at this all day and just got home. Downloaded bitcoin wallet on my tablet and phone, mutlibit on my Mac, and bitcoin qt on my desktop. Now I'm lost again, the keys and addresses are confusing to locate and open and ive got no clue which numbers to write down. What a learning curve. You've helped a great deal though I wish I had some BTC to tip you!

Assuming they bought an even number of coins, they've made about .6 BTC off of these posts. 
This is good way for money ?!

Couldn't you withdraw from coinbase to the merchant?
Example: check out with bitcoin. Come to the screen that says "Your total is 100$ please send x mBTC to z." Withdraw x from coinbase to address z!
