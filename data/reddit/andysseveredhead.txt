Looking at this webpage, it seems that this "resetting webpage" part is going to require me to hook this thing up, which is something I have no idea how to do over a network, since it only seems to have an ethernet port :(

I believe we've already detached his bank accounts from any bitcoin-related accounts/services; assuming that button on the console is a hardware reset, that should suffice then, right?

It looks like this is a 2-step process. Unless the second step is just an alternate option to accomplish the same thing.

I hope so. Thanks.

We don't want to be potentially throwing away money.

He had a long A/V cable running from it in the garage to a laptop he'd dissected by the TV. Not sure why he did that, unless it was at one time mining, and removing the chassis and keyboard was to better dissipate heat...
In any case, my next step is to look at that and see if it can access the machine. We're still in the grieving phase, so it hasn't felt like the appropriate time to actually start on this project, but I'm gathering info ASAP.

Thanks for the tip. It may be awhile before my uncle's ready to really start rooting around, though.

I'll be sure to do that the next time I'm over: depending on how long that is, I might have to make a second post just to get noticed...

It's worrying: apart from whatever projects he was in the middle of on his computers, he had a small collection of retro consoles, and I worry about it all falling into disrepair. Fortunately, he has a sister, and I hope she can at least take care of the consoles; the computers will probably have to be wiped after they're combed through.

Right, of course. Thank you.

Glancing over that, I'm not seeing any productive info. Are you seeing anything?
@_date: 2016-11-13 20:31:28
No, it's more that he left a system in place that my uncle's paying the electrical bill to maintain. It'd be silly to leave it as it is: that money could go towards the funeral expenses.

It's worth mentioning that this slip of paper was found in his wallet: is it likely that he'd have kept his key on his person like that? Is this something others do?

Fortunately, since he wasn't fully independent yet, I imagine most of his records and other miscellaneous accounts would still be in the control of my uncle, any affairs relative to them should be easier for him to settle: it's his more personal effects that are the problem.
