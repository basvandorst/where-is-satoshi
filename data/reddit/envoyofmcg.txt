Not sure why you're being downvoted...the financial industry is crucial to a modern society.

This is sarcasm, right? He's out 3,000 and that number will likely increase in the coming weeks/months...
"It'll go up eventually!" really isn't a sane analysis or basis for an investment.

It's only good if it recovers and *remains stable* for an extended period. If it keeps booming and busting over and over, it'll never be adopted by merchants and will always be a commodity to be speculated, not a legitimate currency.

You really don't read up very much, do you?
Protip: Sites dedicated to reporting on Bitcoin have their income invested in Bitcoin not dying. They're not a reliable source. It's like going to Apple's website for news on Apple stock.

Yes, they really did. Either that or they said "oh I'll just hold it until 500 then cash out" or "bitcoin is the way of the future! Its fundamentals are undervalued! This is just a market correction!".  Little did they know they were too blind to see that maybe, just maybe, 500% ROI is a good time to sell, or that 3000% volume isn't sustainable.

I like that attitude! Keep buying! BUY BUY BUY!
And then I'll sell once the price goes up.

IT'S A FEATURE

ITT: People speak too soon.
Did you learn nothing from this whole debacle? You're not fucking psychic, stop acting like you know what the "normal" is and assuming Bitcoin is stable. Don't be stupid and don't bet more than you're willing to lose because in the end, at this point, you should treat Bitcoin like a gamble.

It sounds like he's listing legitimate problems with Bitcoin as it is now. Namely:
- Bitcoin has no accountability. There are no regulators, and there is no one to prevent fraud, abuse, or outright theft.
- Bitcoin's monetary base cannot be changed. Some see this as a deterrent against inflation, but what happens when deflation occurs?
- Bitcoin's exchanges aren't reliable and are often shady. Just today, we've all seen "the most reliable" BTC exchange taken down for hours due to traffic volume. Even with multiple exchanges,  a lack of accountability combined with poor reliability makes for a poor support system for a currency.
- Bitcoin is susceptible to manipulation. In addition, money laundering and other illicit behaviors can abound on the market and make it the target of both governments and competing organizations.
- Bitcoin can't be changed, even if said change is needed. Due to a lack of centralization, the monetary supply can never be increased/values changed/trading frozen to prevent crashes because there Is no central authority. This is a benefit in many ways, but leads to massive unabated crashes like today's. 
I'll be downvoted, but if Bitcoin users want BTC to succeed, they need to listen to criticism like this and take it seriously. Sure, there's a lot of scaremongering crap in this article, but the basic criticism is sound. I wouldn't trust my life savings to Bitcoin, either.

These are the kind of people investing in Bitcoin.
This is the level of expertise running the exchanges.
Edit: To avoid making a pointless post, I'm going to give you some advice: look up "purchasing power". Yes, you did lose money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:45:03
Oh please, don't give that bullshit about how "big money and big interests" are out to get you. Even if they were, that doesn't make obviously biased reports by Bitcoin investors valid. 
In addition, your comparison to those invested in Bitcoin to those invested in the Dollar/Euro/Yen/etc. is outright laughable. You realize that the market cap of Bitcoin is less than 1/100th of a single exchange dealing in USD, right? You do realize that media is "biased" towards government-sanctioned money because it's what's actually used daily, right? You do realize that anyone hoping to use Bitcoin as an actual currency will starve and/or be punished for failing to pay taxes?
Stop being delusional. Right now, you have to realize that BITCOIN IS NOT VALUED AS A CURRENCY. It is valued as a commodity, like gold. And just like how cash4gold.com and Fox News commercials aren't a good source for gold news, Bitcoin websites are biased and bad for getting your news.
It's not a giant conspiracy to discredit Bitcoin, it's just that Bitcoin discredits itself with its volatility and overall uselessness in everyday life. I hope for your sake you realize that and don't take serious financial advice from sites and people that just want their investments to do well.

Well, that's mostly because opinions that agree with the majority will be upvoted and, therefore, visible. Which means that as people stopped buying and started selling, the more moderate people started being upvoted by the stupidly optimistic people who lost money. 
A few days ago an image macro with a skeleton sitting at a computer saying "surely bitcoin will crash soon..." received over 100 karma. Now, the top post is about the whole thing being a bubble, and the Suicide Hotline has been on the front page for a day. It's a flaw in Reddit, really, and the relentless optimism of the people on this sub, akin to stock speculators in 1929.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:10:51
Because something like this is totally possible.
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:47:23
Yes, yes, come on go- uh, guys, the fundamentals are strong! THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP! BUY BUY BUY!
^^^^Heheheheh...
