Ok, so how much is the ceiling? Is there a celing?

Essentially, I am trying to learn. I'm trying to understand its potential going forward.


This is what I'm trying to understand: if it goes mainstream, what will the effects of that be, monetary-wise? Will their $700 Bitcoin be worth far more then? A little more? (obviously no one knows, but hypothetically, what are the potential rewards?)

I see that, but I'm trying to understand it from the point of view of someone who only *today* decides to invest in Bitcoin... and let's say they believe that it will potentially go up to ten thousand, like you say.
If they put $1000 into Bitcoin today, they'll only gain $10000.... which is nice, but nothing groundbreaking. If they put $5000, they'll get $50000.
If they put the same amount of money into Litecoin, the returns will be far far more lucrative. I understand that Litecoin could be worth zero tomorrow. So could Bitcoin.
That's what I'm trying to understand here -- knowing that both of these currancies are volatile, what makes a person invest money in Bitcoin today, knowing that they'd need to invest thousands of dollars in order to reap a good return?
With all currencies, you don't know what they'll be worth tomorrow. But at least with the alternative currancies, you at least have the advantage of buying them very cheap today. With Bitcoin, you neither have the cheap advantage nor the knowing that it'll go up.

Oh I see, can you elaborate on that, because I don't know much about what market cap is and how adoption will affect Bitcoin's value...
If you're in it just for the monetary gain, and you have $5000 to invest, what's the best way to look at all these cryptocurrencies and decide which one you want to invest in?

Ok, so I assume you bought Bitcoins, being on this subreddit... what was your primary motivation? A return on your investment or to buy stuff online using them?

Can you explain? If John invests $5000 into Bitcoin, what kind of rewards could he attain in the best case scenario?
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:49:08
But... what would be the reward in the end? Let's say John has a $1000 and buys 1 Bitcoin... how much could the value of Bitcoin really rise and how much would he be able to gain from his one-coin investment?

Thanks for your informative answer ;)
I'm genuinely curious about the best case reward for someone who invests in Bitcoin today.
I understand how the people who bought Bitcoin years ago got rich, I'm trying to understand the perspective of someone who is only buying today and hoping to get rich from it....

Can you explain? If John buys 1 bitcoin today and Bitcoin reaches world domination, will he gain much from it? If so, what are the possibilities?
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:00:08
Is that something you believe will happen? Is that what everyone who is only now buying into Bitcoin hoping for?
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:26:55
So — I assume you own Bitcoins — what is your motivation for buying them?
