Hey, I insist. I've already donated a decent amount to charity this year. I actually own bitcoin and other crypto but posted that as a social experiment because I needed a reminder to stay involved with bitcoin core in my portfolio. I think the use case for it has dropped a lot and most ppl are just chasing price. Other cryptos make more sense to me as far as actually transacting with.
If you change your mind let me know, I really do insist

Thanks everyone for taking the time to answer. This was a social experiment and I've chosen a winner!

I like the answer for simplicity sake but I would have to argue that based off of what I've seen bitcoin is hardly usable as a currency even peer-to-peer because of transaction costs and slow speeds. Not to mention that mining companies having a large amount of control over the network (almost like a government) feels very centralized. Why bitcoin over alternatives?

Coming out of nowhere in the final hour with a great answer lol. I really like this answer even though I'm still not fully convinced on Bitcoin over other crypto like ltc, bch, or vtc... etc 
Please pm me and I'll send you $50 worth of any crypto you'd like

All legitimate reasons to question where you stand with your investment.

Nice answer with a personal touch and vision for the future. I can really appreciate what crypto has done for you - but why bitcoin though when there are other alternatives?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:52:16
I like your answer as a runner up. please pm me and I'll send you $25 in any crypto you'd like.

I'm really glad to hear that you found a real use for crypto in general and threw in the bank story too. Definitely a refreshing example of a real world scenario
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:24:52
Glad I'm not the only person thinking it. It's a red flag for me at this price point for me to ignore. Thanks I'll check out your thread

I invite you to be open minded and look at the scenario from a different perspective.
It seems like those who take chances and manage themselves financially do better.
Everything is still speculative at this point and if cryptocurrency ends up offering more value than the traditional financial system then mass adoption and demand naturally follows.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency offers a global solution to banking and personal finance where the traditional seems to be lacking innovation in many areas. Keep in mind that no system is perfect and human nature is always a factor concerning how smoothly system A or B operates.
When you say "poor" I believe poor represents a person's overall mindset. I'm making a general statement but it's safe to say that the majority of people who have financial issues have a "poor" mindset when it comes to educating themselves with money management skills and also have a poor ability to recognize opportunity - think of "seeing the bigger picture" or having "vision".
How does what I say tie everything together?
While I agree that it sucks for some people, it doesn't really matter what asset or asset or industry it is - the pioneers and early adopters will always win every time. The pioneers are the people who have a vision, make the vision a reality, and make it easily accessible for everyone to follow. Often the pioneers are "rich in knowledge" or "rich" in other abilities MOST people aren't willing to learn.
You seem angry so if you don't want to support cryptocurrency then you don't have to. If you believe that the world is heading towards adoption of digital currency then please stay. The current value (including mining costs) of crypto reflects the speculative adoption. If the real life cost of living skyrockets (hyper inflates) and cryptocurrency makes sense to more people then it proves the other system is broken and that the winner is the solution.
Before forming an opinion you should look into the problems that the traditional system has. The USD has 90%+ it's original value, corporate greed etc. I'm not suggesting that this doesn't translate over to some degree. I'm sure that if you can think of the overall value proposition cryptocurrency has to offer to combat these problems it might change your perspective. 
"Rich" people generally take more chances, recognize solutions to problems, and thirsty for knowledge/resources to make it happen. This is usually rewarded fairly.
"Poor" people generally are closed minded, don't act on opportunity, don't look for problems to solve, and don't question their reality until a breaking point - usually a point where it's too late. 
Rich or poor, it's USUALLY your mindset and your own fault that you're like that. 
Crypto is a speculative global solution to financial problems and should be treated as such until more adoption comes along. Value reflects adoption and use case. You can avoid overpaying for a speculative asset with education. 
Have a great day.

Lolol! If you have money in btc and you don't at least make an effort to teach what you know to other people you're really only just buying an idea and hoping it will work. Do you really want to leave your investment or any investment up to chance? I'm only suggesting that anyone financially invested should make an effort to inform others to speed up mainstream adoption aka major goal of btc. It's just advice, do whatever you want to do!
