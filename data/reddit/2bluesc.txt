You could run your own with my [docker-openvpn]( and then pay VULTR via bitcoin ([link with referral code for $10 credit](
Or checkout a project thrown together built on top of it:   which accepts Bitcoin via Stripe.

For reference: [my VPS did ~ 1TB upload in 113 days](
* Download: (45 gigabyte) / (113 days) = 4.6 kBps
* Upload: (1 terabyte) / (113 days) = 102.4 kBps
That was on a VPS in the cloud with 80-100 connections.

Yeah.  That's partially the point.  I believe users should have levels of security. I use LastPass for things logins I most don't care about with the upside being easy access.  For things that I reallly care about (Private keys, GPG backups, Bitcoin wallet backups, FDE headers, etc) they deserve another level of security.

It kind of is.  So is crossing the street, driving a car, airplane, food, etc.
What about the probability of someone else "randomly generating" the same private key as you?
That said, my next next desktop will be an Intel Xeon E3 with ECC memory because I'm more concerned about bit flips in data that's written back to my disk.

I wasn't targeting you with my comment, but the README in the Github repo which implements "google authenticator" without even mentioning RFC6238.  This oversight largely discredits the repo in my opinion before even looking at the code.
Also, the repo hasn't been touched in over two years.  Maybe the author just hacked something together for himself and moved on, which is admirable from a learning perspective.  Perhaps I'm being too hard on him if this is the case :)

This is dangerous. If someone cracks your Gmail acccount (assuming it's the email on record) and then attempts to take over another account that's backed by your Google account, then they can use the 2FA code sent to Google Voice.

So, one would need to use the Airbitz software to access private keys?  What if I wanted to export the private seed and then access it later from a different app?
Anything standard like BIP-38?

I waited ~ 24-48 hours to get my bitcoins out.  I was freaking out.  I first sent 1 BTC to test the system and it was instant.... the balance took 24+ hours and I was pissed.  Finally came through though.  Excellent reason to never use that exchange again.

I have a System76 laptop (Galago UltraPro) and while the build quality is "meh" i really picked it because of the processor and Linux support.  Had they offered Bitcoin, I would have definitely used Bitcoin to purchase the laptop.  Would I buy another System76... not sure.  Biggest downfall is the abysmal battery life (perhaps due to the non ultra low power processor in this notebook, but my rMBP does better...)

I hate that people call it "Google Authenticator 2FA".  Google Authenticator is just an implementation of RFC6238, not some Google magic.

A much easier approach is to get a VPS running Xen/KVM/QEMU technology (not OpenVZ) and Ubuntu 14.04 or and run the whole mess in a Docker container.  All the work is taken care of for you.

There is even a one liner that you can run as root if you're adventurous and trusting or a simpler way to run stuff after you review what it does.
@_date: 2015-04-25 16:26:12
You run other services on the node anyways.  For example I have a Docker image that can easily run an [OpenVPN node]( on the same serve that my bitcoind node is running.
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:09:33
I have assembled a bitcoind docker container and run them on VULTR $5/mo storage VPS with patience.  Definitely takes a swap file and something like almost a week to get off the ground.

PSA: [Authy]( does back-up and encrypt your 2FA secrets.
It's probably better that a single Google account doesn't also hold your secrets as it becomes a round-about single factor auth.
Authy exists for the sole purpose of things like this (i.e. 2FA).  Google Authenticator is just a simple implementation by Google that probably goes on without any real attention or resources devoted to it.

Partially Authy's fault, but they are trying to target the most likely use case where people have no 2FA because 2FA is too hard to setup.  I have the password protection for my Authy devices (which it periodically asks me to confirm that I remember).  Someone would need to hack my cell carrier to steal my number AND crack my protection passphrase.  This is a good usability-security compromise for me.
Usability is the difficult part about security.
Worse today are things like Google Voice SMS and T-Mobile's new [DIGITS]( service that allows you to receive SMS on multiple devices.  With these technologies people need not hack you cell phone provider or cell phone itself, but in addition they can elect to hack your laptop, desktop, or whatever else has access to the digits account to receive the 2FA auth code sent via SMS.
If only we used more Yubikeys....
