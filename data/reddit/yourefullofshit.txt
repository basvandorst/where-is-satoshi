SpendBT.com is also run by a complete fucking idiot who admits on a public forum that he keeps and stores credit card numbers unencrypted because "you can't use a credit card number without the expiration date".  Anybody who puts money on your garbage site should immediately be subject to a mental health examination and a forced sterilization.

I troll this forum because bitcoin hurts more people than it helps.  The way bitcoin was designed is a classic pyramid scheme and whether you admit it or not, the majority of you have lost money while a select few got wealthy.  Bitcoin user base doubled during the November 13' bubble which means quite literally the majority of users here are underwater.  I think what you guys do here is morally reprehensible.  You are tricking gullible teenagers and people with political ideologies into thinking if they buy bitcoin they will be rich.  Nobody buying bitcoin in these stages is going to get rich, period.  You guys are a bunch of multi-level marketing scammers pushing junk products on people for a technology that is very obviously not taking off in any way.  In 6 years bitcoin has been talked about by many, used by few.  There's no reason to buy bitcoin until there's a use case, and until then you are all just penny stock pushing conman (intentionally or unintentionally for some).
Go ahead, ban me, delete the post, been there done that.  Like you said, alt accounts are unlimited, and I'll be keeping you very, very busy.

That sure is some nice back pedaling after stating "we store credit card numbers in plain text" by your very own admission.
And then the best part was your response to us:
"I suspect by the end of this feedback weekend, and before we launch, this will be solved."
