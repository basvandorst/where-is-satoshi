Don't think the forkers understand if they undermine the confidence in bitcoin it will likely result in lack of confidence in their shitcoin and cause a huge crash...then their variable difficulty rate will mean nuts

The only people who own bitcoin right now are moderately tech conscious individuals. Might not be technical enough to understand the technology but they understand enough to understand the value.
Most people over 50 think bitcoin makes no sense, and non-technical people with wealth would likely think the same thing. Look at all the Fortune articles spreading nonsense about how bitcoin has no inherit value.
That's like saying software has no value, it makes no sense, but a layman is more likely to think electronic money is worthless and this is all speculation.

Think bitcoin should be used to transact high value trades personally, be where you store large amounts of wealth and alt coins can be used for day to day transactions

If 30B of liquid assets were dumped into bitcoin in 2 months it would be worth way more
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:30:45
Means they have had the account for only one day

I guarantee you most wealthy people do not own a significant sum in bitcoin, which is why when they do buy in the price will go up.
It is guaranteed that less 16.6M people own less than 5K USD in bitcoin right now, there are more than 16.6M wealthy people in the world.

Hopefully everyone will realize bcash is a trash altcoin trying to steal bitcoin's brand

No sell
Only buy
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:44:52
Actually had two barriers getting close at the same time (ETH at $400, BTC at $5000) think that's what made the loss worst than normal for a day

There is a dip going on rn
Buy the fucking dip
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:26:03
Seriously, buy the dip, don't sell, we're the early adopters 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:19:31
If you haven't sold by now better just hold that shit
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:17:25
do it now
Buy the dpi?

Yeah I never understood the stock to crypto analysis, it's a system for accounting transactions not a company, you can't transfer ownership of stocks in a reasonably reasonable amount of time (better to just sell and gift fiat IMO, have new owner buy the stocks)

Europe you have a better government retirement entitlement, nothing like the US, why your salaries are so much lower

Would never happen, if he bought it would be through a network of other assets that hide his involvement, would be impossible to prosecute.

Also 401K there are heavy penalties for withdrawing early, why I stopped contributing and put all my excess in crypto

GBTC is up because they are only allowed to issue so many shares at a time and the demand is very high for it, when they issue more shares value has to come down, it would be smart to short GBTC because this is always what happens in this scenario, I’m drunk right now, so if I don’t make sense but do make sense at the same time that’s why
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:52:33
FUCKING HODL
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:19:31
If you haven't sold by now better just hold that shit
