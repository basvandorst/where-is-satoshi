When you buy BTC, it has a basis USD value. When you "sell" your BTC to buy ETH, for example, you have a gain or loss on your BTC, and then a basis USD value for your ETH. 
Repeat as needed. You then have a gain or loss in USD when you sell your ETH for USD or BTC for example.
So, lets say I buy 1 BTC for $1000. I then trade 20 ETH for that 1 BTC, when the BTC price is $2000. I then have a $1000 gain on the BTC (which you pay taxes on, short or long term depending on how long you held the BTC), and then a new basis price for ETH of $100 ($2000 for 20 ETH). When I sell the ETH, you calculate how much gain or loss using the $100 basis price. If say, BTC then goes down to $1000 again, but you sell your ETH to get 2 BTC at this point, the amount of gains is actually zero, as you sold the ETH for $2000 total, the same price you bought it at.
Unless you are trading very minimally, you will likely need software to calculate the gains/losses, as the exchanges do not do this for you yet.
This is how it works for stocks, which are classified as property, the same as cryptocurrencies (cite:

All gains are taxable, whether you cash out of GDAX, or not.

No, because the gains were "locked" in on the trade, you are paying the capital gains on each trade.
I thought the exact same thing as you did (hey, if I never cash out, I'm good), but found out that is not true after discussing with a tax lawyer earlier this year.
(edit) I kinda misread your question. The answer is still no. When you trade from BTC to ETH, you have to calculate the BTC/ETH USD amount at the time of the trade, which is why I used the above example (I believe you can use the same price for all trades on a day for some ease of reporting, if you wish, but don't quote me on that). So you are paying gains on the USD price at the time of trade, even if you stayed entirely in crypto.

According to this, yes:

Farther down the page:
"What about if I bought some Ethereum or Dogecoins?
Potentially another tax event. Think of it as selling Bitcoins back to cash, then buying your other coins with that. That sale might have gains, and so is treated the same way. "

I do use cointracking.info but there are some significant roadblocks I'm having issues with.
