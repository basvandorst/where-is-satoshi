Actually this is a bit older news, I've tweeted about it around 1-3 weeks ago.

I discovered Bitcoin on May 15, 2011. I had found [this blog post]( on Techmeme) and Bitcoin was rising and traded between 6-8 US Dollar.
One year later in May 2012 I was still happy. Bitcoin had a bubble peak at 35 US Dollar and crashed back to 5-6 US Dollar for some months.
Invested nothing so far. Bitcoin at $100 looked like a crazy price to me. I'm feeling like a idiot. Today.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:37:56
A crazy correction. Yes.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:39:27
Because that day is currently ~48 hours away. I didn't wanted to ask you what Bitcoin price you predict for March 23, 2019...

Why are you guys so negative? My simple question got -7 downvotes. I didn't say anything bad about Bitcoin.
I'm already used to negative news about the subreddit topic getting downvoted in other subreddits. Making their subreddits unbelievable filterbubbles. But this was a neutral question. It seems you can't even ask neutral things from subreddit fans, because thats boring? :/
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:21:34
As said above, I watch Bitcoin since it was at $5 US Dollar. I would have never in my life invested at $400.
Unless you expect Bitcoin to rise to $4000.

Thanks for taking the time. I agree with your outlook.

Asking a simple BTC price prediction on Reddit. Answers:
- What's so special about that day?
- Check out this other subreddit
- The price could go anywhere
- Fun answer (turn right by the streetlight)
- And two serious answers

Well, well :) 100 Dollar seemed overpriced. The current price is insane. But it seems there is really nothing that can stop it. Still waiting for the big correction :)
Congrats to your risk taking getting in at such a high level.

Thanks for the hint. I meant Tuesday 10th. Updated it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:48:17
Yes, that is what I think as well. I don't think the correction will increase until Tuesday.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:38:14
Bitcoin crashing, too.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:47:00
I was [there](
Didn't invest.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:38:01
That's exactly why I asked. Because nobody knows. So I could find out the sentiment where it might go.

The forum thread which was linked in the post at ar15.com is sadly down :/
In other news I found this info in the chat on mcxNOW today. I can't say if this is a rumor or true.
*"mindragon: 216k bitcoins changed hands on BTC China"*
If that is true and if that person bought the 216K Bitcoin at a price of 1 USD (for less than half a Million US Dollar) and sold today at 600 USD (not waiting for 800 USD) that would be worth 129.600.000 USD (almost 130 Million US Dollar).
**If that person in China bought the 216K Bitcoin at a price of 1 Cent - when it all started - he would have made a gigantic 130 Million US Dollar out of a tiny realistic investment of just 2160 US Dollar, with BTC at $600.**

Thanks for pointing that out xandr.
I really didn't expect someone had already asked this question - that's why I didn't search. Normally I always search first.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:39:52
Thanks for advice!
