Maybe you hang around particular types of people

Really interesting article

I think you are misrepresenting the article. It never said that. It was questioning the more naive aspects of blockchain utopianism, and asking that people think more about it
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:59:55
Why, just because Roger told you so? Maybe it needs to be tested before we actually see

This is bullshit that it's a pump and dump - why would the founders promote themselves on the website and do interviews if they were deliberately planning to screw people, and why is r/bitcoin so cynical - this is supposed to be people interested in positive futures, not cynical old conspiracy theorists

He's basically saying 'donate to charities to get the Feds off your back' rather than 'donate to charities because these causes really matter'. He probably doesn't mean that, but that's how it comes across

Of course, if you pay people bonuses for tracking down crimes, it incentivises them to arrange the crimes to then be tracked down

Hmm, the slightly weird thing is that the first transaction between the two accounts occurs on 2013-12-24, and the last on 2014-01-27 (like a few days ago), so it went on for a while

Ha ha, cool, thanks
@_date: 2014-02-03 08:41:38
Yep, I get that. I suspected that the quote was taken out of context. 
Maybe the way to put it is that the BTC community should do as much as possible to not look like a rampantly self-serving club if it wants to gain sympathy, not only from regulators but from the public at large. In my opinion, the community - if there is such a thing anymore - should move away from saying how great BTC is as defensive way to escape control (ala Dark Wallet) or to get rich (ala Silicon Valley) but instead refocus the narrative around inclusion, openess and how BTC could really help people
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:47:44
The point wasn't about the price - the point was the combination of the price with the rhetoric of revolution, which you clearly invoke as a marketing tool. I don't care if you want to charge £495, just don't pretend it's some kind of populist movement at that price. There are real people who die in real revolutions around the world, and they don't make nice salaries to do it, so just think about that before you whip out the posters with fists in the air
@_date: 2014-09-03 09:16:56
The point is not so much that they're charging £495, it's that they're then claiming that they are the face of a revolution - I guess it's a highly exclusive revolution, only open to market participants who have the buying power to 'demand' access. That is the most bourgeoisie revolution I've ever hear of, a revolution of the suits and bankers
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:22:59
Cool, thanks
@_date: 2014-09-03 08:24:00
Yeah but then they shouldn't abuse the language of revolution for something that if effectively an exclusive club
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:21:22
You'll see that it's run by someone called Lui Smyth, who is a digital theorist based at UCL. He did the same survey last year

In left-wing circles, anarchist is considered far-left. I'm interested as to why you think it should be more to the right (unless you consider anarcho-capitalism to be the representative of 'anarchism')
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:12:49
And it's also anonymous, so not entirely sure how you imagine it would somehow compromise you
@_date: 2014-09-05 11:06:37
What Bitcoin needs is to appear more inclusive and less techy, and setting up an aggressive big fist surrounded by tech company sponsors doesn't exactly do that, but sure, I'm sure it will draw in a lot of men who work in tech. I understand how marketing works, and I'm sure you are authentically excited about the epic vision of the future Bitcoin economy, but if you really want to push Bitcoin into wider acceptance maybe conferences should consider getting over the hypermasculinsed pseudo-revolution and tech-fetishism. 
Anyway, I won't be able to afford to go, but I've got friends going, so I'm sure I'll hear all about it
@_date: 2014-06-23 09:09:49
Now you have

Well Reddit is actually a centralised ledger, so I can delete at will ;)
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:43:24
Those of you who keep calling for the name of the bank are missing the point. Everyone knows that a variety of banks in the UK are refusing to deal with Bitcoin. For example, Barclays, is known for this  but it's not just Barclays. In my case it happens to be a smaller bank who are not as big an asshole as Barclays is (I used to bank with Barclays actually). The point is that the regulatory uncertainty is making them paranoid to deal with anything that looks a bit like Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:10:20
Cool bro, I honestly don't care if you want to believe the story or not
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:47:22
And for all those who are getting paranoid and suspicious, I don't gain much from putting random stories on Reddit, and just because I don't happen to answer every single resultant comment overnight doesn't mean I'm trying to hide something, so chill out

@_date: 2015-01-21 14:01:18
Ha ha, listen to yourself. I don't where you get this idea that I'm under some kind of contract to provide you with whatever information you demand. I shared the story, so take it or leave it
Actually, I'll make it like a choose-your-own-adventure. Is my bank 1) Rothschild's 2) Coutts or 3) Hoares Bank
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:24:18
You know, I really don't like mob mentality and it tends to get my back up when a whole group of people collectively demand something without even saying please. Actually, it has the opposite effect on me - I don't want to give information when people demand it. 
But, you know, if people just did even the most basic amount of investigation into this, you would have found blatantly obvious clues like this

@_date: 2016-03-31 11:20:38
I kind of like the fact that they are subtle about it, rather than plastering 'we accept Bitcoin' all over their front page. It was a nice surprise to see it there in the payment options as just another option - makes it feel more legitimate
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:20:41
The utility is not stored in anything. It is experienced and used. Utility means 'usefulness of something'. You cannot 'store' usefulness of something in anything other than that thing itself. Money is merely claims upon the labour of others and it derives its imagined value from that. It is not 'stored utility' or 'stored labour'. I mean, please feel free to explain to me how you 'store' your utility from labour in a US dollar...
@_date: 2016-06-07 18:31:27
Hmm, you're the one who sounds nervous and defensive. 
The article was written by Arthur Brock, who has a long history of working on alternative currency systems. I don't think he represents the 'they' you speak of
@_date: 2016-06-13 14:57:21
That's a well thought out response from someone who has had their true economic interests challenged
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:15:17
Is that an argument, or a statement of faith?
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:15:50
This reveals a lack of understanding about the nature of value. Value is real utility created by human labour and resources. It is not money

I don't know you, but if you really care about liberating yourself economically, please don't rely on trading speculative objects. Read some critical economic theory instead
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:09:17
But... what if the real amount was supposed to be only 10 million Bitcoin... in which case the 21 million is a debasement. Or what if it has been made 40 million? The actual amount is arbitrary. You're not talking about scarcity at all, you're talking about unchangeability
Fiat money in fact is scarce, but it is changeable, and that's what you don't like
Scarcity by itself means bugger all. Toxic waste is scarce - it doesn't make it valuable
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:46:50
This narrative about fiat money not being scarce is often pushed out on this subreddit, but fiat money is definitely kept scarce. The fact that price levels stay reasonably stable from day to day rather than entering hyperinflation is a reflection of that, and the commercial banks, who determine the M1 money supply (not the state) know it is not in their interest to willy-nilly issue new electronic money via fractional reserve credit issuance. Also, states are not so stupid as to undermine themselves by endlessly changing the base money supply - it's not in the US state's interest to induce hyperinflation

Perhaps it could piggyback on an existing service
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:01:49
How about a service called BitMule where people who are travelling overseas and have spare luggage capacity offer to take packages for a small BTC fee. There would have to be processes in place to prevent them being used to smuggle contraband, but might be a fun little project for someone to design this. Maybe BitMule is not the best name, but you get the point...

Ha ha, excellent points! The fascinating aspect of bitcoin culture to me is this strange interplay between democratic radicalism and techno-conservatism (not sure if this is the right phrase). I guess the Hobbes vs. Rousseau idea is useful as an initial way to describe the immediate features of the currency to someone who is trying to learn, and perhaps it's theoretical radical potential, but indeed your points about the subtle Hobbesian power of the code is very interesting
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:49:44
On the bottom of the my personal webpage for the book I advertise the option, and on social media. The interesting dynamic is that my publisher obviously struggles to accept bitcoin itself, so I have to buy the book from them and then pass it on the person who is paying bitcoin for it - maybe one day I can convince the publisher to accept it too!
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:46:34

That's a pretty decent deal - good to see actual services being exchanged
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:10:50
It's a pretty decent rule-of-thumb in financial markets that as soon as everyday people start talking about something they have no intuitive knowledge of, it's potentially close to a peak. For example, when the boys in the pub are all talking about buying properties to renovate, there's a decent chance that a property bubble is forming. Why do people all of a sudden want to buy bitcoin - not because they think it's a useful addition to their lives, but because they're seeing the price going up and are feeling the animal spirits, thinking 'damn, I should buy that too'
