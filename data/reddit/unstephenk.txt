I have been using them for 3 years and have always paid with BTC. They are awesome!

Switched to Tee Spring. Tee Chip customer support is non-existent. I called them and emailed them several times. They never got back in touch with me. Bye Felicia! Here is my new link

Hmmm... I will be on the look out for this email. What would be a good response to avoid having to own a license? What state do you live in?

I was there. That's how I heard of them.

Cool! I may do that! Thanks!

Made the changes!

I bet they left because JPMorgan wants to corrupt the Blockchain in their advantage.

I left them a long time ago. They can be very sketchy sometimes. And they stopped operating in the U.S.!

Let me know how sales go. I am trying to launch a site of my own.
