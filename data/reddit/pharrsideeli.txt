every night is red panty night cause of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:26:52
lol i cant see bitcoin go up $50 without seeing this graph somewhere saying "bull trap" no offense to OP though but you get the point.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:18:58
when you sell you get your native currency from there you can either buy again or send it to your bank account
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:41:42
where did he say bitcoin ? i only saw him talk about how he wants to learn more about crypto in general to see how the technology could help
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:36:49
violated the rule "Never buy more than you can afford to lose" 
I appreciate your enthusiasm for crypto by going all in but seriously don't risk getting evicted for 0.0067 btc

Him &amp; Tai Lopez should fuck off. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:19:08
it would show up by now if Coinbase actually sent it but they haven't, are you catching on now ?
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:01:50
I agree but I already saw similar posts on the top page an hour before i posted this so i didn't want to be late to the party so yeah I messed up.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:03:01
That wasn't a boyfriend that was a banker.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:19:56
that's my problem with Coinbase at the moment. They're so quick at grabbing cash but drag their feet at sending it out
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:33:09
this needs more attention
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:06:54
it would be dead, dead on arrival
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:23:12
I'll do it when it reaches 20k when Bitcoin doesn't apologize to all the Alts. Thanks for the idea btw, I'll be sure to give you the proper credit for it
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:23:20
no, hes looking into it on 2018. Implementation is another thing.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:26:51
As you can tell, I put lots of time and effort into this.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:29:56
......what do you mean ran away with it ?

plot twist, the person with Killer in his username is the one who kills the wife
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:08:10
same happened with me, i waited around 12 hours for it to send to Binance. Its just Coinbase being a shitty exchange, that's all.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:43:09
26% in a day is impressive ?

did the back of Satoshi's head just get leaked ????
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:33:30
There's a slim chance he uses the blockchain but implementing a currency ? I doubt that as of now. From what I understand he's just looking into it to get familiar with the technology. Nothing more as of now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:41:11
he'd probably bitch out, I would.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:49:42
Honestly the best way to make money on crypto is to do your own research and understand the technology you're investing in. If you just follow people's advice blindly you're gonna get burned. slowly invest but dont invest more than you can afford to lose. The more you understand the environment, the more money you'll make anyways best of luck on your journey ! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:46:30
Just to add to this comment, the reason why we detrust Coinbase and its exchange (GDAX) is because when big rallies or drops happen they usually shut down so it makes it difficult to buy at the bottom or sell off at the top.
@_date: 2018-10-08 23:11:29
engaging and entertaining for sure but for sharing concepts and ideas i highly disagree because it is a debate. One idea vs another and we view it as there can only be 1 winner. This is why discussions are better because there's not a forced idea of only 1 winner. Instead it focuses on what works and what does not.
@_date: 2018-10-08 10:40:01
what's the point of a debate ? It never truly works just a showcase of two ideals being polished with words and then walking away with both feeling like they won.  
No one wins anything, it does not progress us in any sort of way. Why can't the community focus on constructive discussions instead. Just my two cents 
@_date: 2019-08-04 18:23:13
If we all wake up on the right side of the bed, the price will go down.

Knight Templars?   
Now that is a conspiracy that I have not heard of in years! Too many Rothschild, Rockefeller, Illuminati shit, at least we have old school conspiracies floating around today.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:39:30
yeah dont post this here, post it in r/Cryptocurrency but then again you will be just as equally downvoted over there
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:42:33
do you only use this reddit account to tell people off and feel superior about yourself cause that's what it seems like.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:41:32
you're just passing other's speculation as fact because you agree with their speculation

Never met a Chinese native that doesn't know China's language
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:40:11
nvm you're a bot
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:04:59
I've never met someone who is disliked in both r/Bitcoin &amp; in r/BTC, well done.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:49:46
I highly doubt you will be banned for saying that but okay
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:39:27
yet you don't believe in it 


Seems to me you're trying to dump your shitcoin bags 
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:34:53

@_date: 2018-03-16 10:34:58
you're shilling the fuck out of yoyow.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:17:54
you're a bagholder &amp; shilling the coins that screwed you over to dump your bags
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:12:32
Price analysis should be left for Twitter
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:24:22
show us how much BTC you own at the very least so we can verify that you're as big of a shit as you make yourself out to be
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:45:21
nvm another bot spamming stories
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:49:11
noob here but any good wallet to store btc that will not support 2x
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:52:38
although BTC might not be directly connected to some of these coins (majority are) you can still link them to BTC some way
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:41:52
i bet you're saying fuck you to the moderators so you can head over to r/btc and be like "woooooooow r/Bitcoin banned me for nothing"
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:03:06
thank you for teaching me something new!
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:28:19
Its like they come over and throw a rock at our window and get offended we throw profanities at them in return. Like why even post this here

Did you know Cryptography existed before the modern era ? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:28:26
i thought you were being sarcastic and then I went through your post history and you shit talk this sub a lot. Nearly all your recent comments are here on r/bitcoin yet you say things like


My question for you, if you think we're all retarded why do you visit ? Nourish your own coin instead of focusing on what you think is "inferior" 
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:12:23
how ? im not saying fuck BCH go BTC woooooo!!! 
All i am doing is asking you, hey dude why are you here if you dont enjoy it here. Nothing more. As for your abortion statement my true stance would be if my mom was anti abortion and I was pro abortion I would ask her why she keeps on joining pro abortion clubs just to shit talk them and try to convert them in an aggressive manner. I hope you realize that by being here you're preaching to deaf ears. Being Pro BCH is okay but cmon its a waste of breath and energy to spew your stance over here. I have no idea why you say im "ostracizing" you. I haven't said anything bad about your or told you your ideals were wrong. I am simply picking your mind to try to figure out why you're here
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:24:43
Well just because its not ridiculous to you does not mean its not for others. I do not think your post should be on this subreddit because its based on fantasy land. its just a currency so the technology behind BTC will NOT get us to the stars. Would it be around by the time we have space travel ? Maybe, but people will not look back on history and correlate Bitcoin as the reason why we had successful space travel or a decentralized Mars civilization.
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:21:28
Your title is gonna catch the attention of r/btc conspiracy nuts
"YOU SEE !!! r/Bitcoin IS CONTROLLED BY BLOCKSTREAM WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY THE ILLUMINATI!!"
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:56:38


No, you don't have to be with us, i don't care about that I just question why you show up here if you hate it here. It makes no sense as to why you show up. I'd assume if you think we are horridly absurd then you would be turned off from visiting here and instead focus on BCH 
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:42:53
that is speculation passed on as fact
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:51:11
you keep failing to answer my question lol. 
You know you can love bitcoin and all that without getting frustrated by visiting this sub right ? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 07:00:53


Dude, you literally came to r/Bitcoin to throw jabs at the community here. If you stick your hand out near the hive a bee is bound to sting you. You obviously think there's things wrong with BTC and its community and you criticize it but I still don't know why you visit here. I disagree with BCH's path so I don't look at what they're doing or go to their subreddit and tell them they're wrong. I just hope that instead of bashing the opposition you could instead help the community you feel is on the right path.
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:35:20
you could be correct, but I highly doubted. Do you think your post is being downvoted because people see it as constructive analysis that contributes to anything here ?
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:16:25
please reread all my responses towards you but this time don't imagine it carries a negative/aggressive tone.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:28:39
why is everyone writing a love letter to Bitcoin on this sub today
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:27:26
where's the TL;DR im just looking for the song name in this sea of words
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:45:36
Nothing, just another altcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:48:51
please point out where I was spreading misery
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:44:04
nope, no one is angry. Your post just does not add anything of value right now.
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:16:29
I'd find a new team to cheer on instead of being salty.
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:00:54
i didn't read your post until now, I just read the title and skimmed through it and saw nothing of value my apologies. Now that I've seen it all I am thinking is why are you posting some sci-fi novel type of post here ? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:33:29
Why should we care ? No offense but the price of these coins SHOULD be irrelevant to Bitcoin.
