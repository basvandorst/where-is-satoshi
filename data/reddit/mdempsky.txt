A prepaid debit card can be used across multiple vendors.

Physical gold is at least useful for metallurgy. What use does Bitcoin have if not as a digital currency?

How does taking a loan from a bank help replace banks? Do you understand that loan interest is a primary source of revenue for banks?

A lot of vendors are accustomed to receiving payment 30 days or so later. See: 
A business wants to maximize profits, which includes minimizing costs. Keeping a channel open for longer allows reducing block transaction fees at the trade off of incurring additional opportunity cost from not having access to the money sooner. It would be up to the business to decide how to balance those costs.

What's its correct value?

Banks don't make money off of people investing in the stock market, except to the extent that some of them also offer investment brokerage services.
Also, are you now saying that Bitcoin is going to replace banks *and* the stock market? Like you think people are going to stop investing in publicly traded companies and only buy Bitcoin instead?

Prepaid visa cards *are* prepaid debit cards.

How do you get 3-4 million USD? Why not 30-40 million or 300-400 thousand?

What makes you say this? JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, etc. have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 for years.

I see. Is that how you use bitcoin? To make purchases?

Instead of going down and to the right, they go up and to the left?

1) Americans have the third highest per-capita energy consumption in the world, and use about 3.5x the global average: 
2) How many people use Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:03:18
Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than many small countries, yet it's used by far far fewer people than the number of inhabitants of those countries. Sorry, but you're the one brainwashed if you think otherwise.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:16:38


That's kind of a huge if.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:38:42


Thankfully, it's not too complex or difficult. I'd recommend starting with [John Bogle's "The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"](

Why not just link to their statements to this effect then? Why should anyone give credence to a rambly message you posted [while driving](

I'm not sure your argument. It seems like you're just trying to make an ad hominem attack by claiming I don't understand zero-sum games, without any supporting evidence or argumentation.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:17:40
There's mathematically no way for everyone to win in a zero-sum game.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:30:31


Agreed: increased demand for gold drives up the price, which makes it more expensive to use in manufacturing.
But to be clear, I don't invest in gold, nor do I advocate doing so.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:32:35


You're not counting the people who sold the bitcoins. You're also playing loose by not distinguishing realized from unrealized gains.
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:14:21
It largely is, though at least gold has material value; eg, it's useful for manufacturing electronics and jewelry.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:28:09


No, some people sell at a gain, some sell at a loss. But the gains and losses balance out.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:32:05
Yes, "investing" in Bitcoin is a [zero-sum game]( When someone sells BTC at $8k, someone else is buying BTC at $8k. In *sum*, they're no better off than they were before. If anything, they're worse because of transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:30:02


I.e., Bitcoin is destroying the environment the fastest, so it's clearly going to be the winner?
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:13:15
Only when the price of Bitcoin is rising. When it's falling, holding fiat is the winning strategy.

Sure, and poker isn't a zero sum game either if we only look at it from the winner's point of view.
But they're not always winning, and there are also other players. In sum, they're just shifting money around, while the house takes a cut.


Stocks are an investment in a fraction of a business. Businesses (on average) improve over time as society advances (e.g., per-capita GDP growth).
Investing in the market is a winning strategy, because you can expect to receive the market's average return. But trying to beat that average return is a zero-sum game: no investor can get above average returns unless another investor gets below average returns.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:34:12
Stocks also represent ownership of tangible assets.

Ding, ding, ding.
Bitcoin isn't creating anything of value though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:43:56


By what metric? Compared to what?

*Put your house on blockchain!*

How? Bitcoin is not a store of energy. Mining consumes energy, and there's no way to get it back.
Pushing water into the mountains is just using the water's potential energy as a battery. It's not bad for the environment.

Pyramid schemes aren't a new thing.
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:11:47
It does. But no one "invests" in the dollar. They invest by using dollars to buy other return-producing assets.
