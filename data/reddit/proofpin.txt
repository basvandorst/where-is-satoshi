Coinbase is now a payment option
@_date: 2013-10-03 08:32:40
We are just trying to do what we can to help Bitcoin. These pins have been selling for twice that price but we want to get them to the local events so that more people have an opportunity to wear them and advertise bitcoin.

I am currently working to add coinbase or another method for transactions on the site
@_date: 2013-09-27 04:50:01
We've been thinking of offering 100 pins for 1 BTC for anyone looking to distribute them at meetings. Message us with whatever you are thinking of ordering and we can talk outside this post.

Just trying to help remove barrier to entry as well as spreading the knowledge of bitcoin. Ever find a coin in ur change that doesnt belong? I have and I always do research to figure out its origin. Hopeing this has the same effect
@_date: 2013-09-12 01:43:27
Of course the site only accepts bitcoin. We believe in the currency
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:33:58
I press them all myself and feel like donating my time in order to spread Bitcoin is well worth it.
@_date: 2013-09-12 15:02:56
I have added an international option to the site

Buy Wearable Bitcoin Pins at 
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:50:38
Thank you. I hope whoever finds it is happy when they discover the value. They are only 0.05 each but thats not bad for free. I thought
@_date: 2013-10-11 06:40:02
We at Proofpin.com accept coinbase for our pins sales and love it. Thank you for making such an easy to integrate payment button.
@_date: 2013-10-03 07:14:29
Check out our other post where we gave away bitcoin on the train. We are planning another similar yet improved marketing tactic later this month.

Pleased to announce I have added coinbase as a payment option
@_date: 2013-09-26 05:51:24
Glad to hear you received them. I hope you like them and wear them with pride.
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:22:45
is one I moderate
My thought for naming conventions of places is if one already exists as it will. Add state or province code to end so for example @_date: 2013-09-14 03:18:39
We now sell in bulk check out the site
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:04:10
I like this idea,  a lot
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:32:40
You can always order one Proofpin.com
@_date: 2013-10-03 08:02:08
Interesting there is barely any coding on the site, nevertheless, I have requested an investigation from Trend Micro. Until its cleared up if you fear the site but want any pins please email 
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:36:23
We will certainly be adding this next time. Just in case
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:19:49
There is information on the back describing what bitcoin is and how to redeem it. I didn't keep the private keys because I couldn't confirm 100% if anyone ever found it, they could just sit on it and never spend it. This however may be something to consider next round. Maybe make them email me to get the private key.
@_date: 2013-09-27 04:29:43
I love the idea of a cloisonné pin. We made a ton of these and thought we'd send some off to supporters who would put them to good use.
@_date: 2013-09-11 16:01:57
Its low budget :) plus we need to appeal to an older market :) yes thats why its old looking nothing to do with my horrible site building skills
@_date: 2013-10-18 05:33:23
Wow thanks for all the quick responses. Quite informative
@_date: 2013-10-16 02:12:37
That reminds me of a picture on our site. Spoiler its a fedora with a bitcoin pin on it :)
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:17:49
Vancouver, Canada. No fear of being drugged by paper here. At least not until I saw that comment. I see where you are going with this idea. I will have to play with different ideas for better distribution next round.
@_date: 2013-09-14 03:19:08
Proid to announce you can now order more than 1 pin at a time
@_date: 2013-09-11 17:14:43
Unfortunately in canada. That being said if anyone wants more than one send us an email on the site and we can work out some better combined shipping
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:36:42
We will be
