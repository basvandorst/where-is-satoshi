Over exchanges perhaps. However, when you can send a Bitcoin trough text and satellite uplink, I naturally become skeptical of the "omnipotent" governments ability to control it. 
Also considering their track record in prohibiting stuff like alcohol and drugs, I would t worry. Not even prisons are drug free, imagine making America Bitcoin free, a money designed to be decentralized for maximum resiliency.

That's great to hear congrats! Many people think that we should hodl to the end of time but what you did is one of the many reasons we have Bitcoin. It's not only to store value but to spend also. 
Don't feel bad about having cashed out at this point. People like you keep the value of Bitcoin alive since it adds utility.

Why do we have to break it down into class warfare? Why can't everyone enjoy the fruits of bitcoin without being judged? There are clear benefits to the tech that anyone can take advantage of regardless of their social class. Alienating one group over another isn't really productive. My two cents at least.

Not saying I agree with the people, but do the majority of bitcoin holders know how the technology works? Are they well versed in the technology and innovation, mission, and potential value of bitcoin? Or are they just here to make a quick speculative buck? I don't know the answer to that question, but it would go a long way in determining whether or not it's a bubble

I wouldn't say dealing with 20%-50% swings in a day is "easy". Or for the real early Bitcoiners watching your coin go from 14 dollars to mere pennies in a short period of time. Bitcoin isn't about the fiat conversion as it is about being an actual deflationary currency. That means no matter what time you get into it, you'll still win. There won't be a central bank that inflated bitcoins to devalue your savings to force you to spend, meanwhile transferring the wealth of lost savings into the hands of the money presses.

I assume coinbase is not part of that group then. Can I transfer to gdax directly from coinbase?

Very true. My only worry is whether or not people getting into bitcoin right now even understand everything you posted above here. But personally I am optimistic and don't think it's a bubble, or if it is, won't be serious.

lol nice straw man. I now see why you have trouble understanding things. Obviously finite supply is not the only thing that gives Bitcoin, or any coin value. The utility, brand, core developers, just to name a few factors, also contribute to price. 
It is basic economics however, that if supply decreases or stays the same, while demand stays the same or increases, price goes up. Not hard at all to grasp.
