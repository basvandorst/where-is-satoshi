If computers will be better next year why buy one now?

Everyone in this thread is suggesting a Nexus 5, which without a doubt is a fantastic phone, but the battery life is not amazing. Personally I'd get an Xperia Z1 if you don't mind rooting it and whatnot and removing Sony's shitty apps but it blows the N5 out of the water IMO.

Gave some of these for Christmas. I left a tab on the end of mine and folded it over the private keys and covered it in foil tape. Turned out nice.

It still has a couple of unique properties: Value, use and adoption

Or hodl both until all the FUD clears. One will crash and burn the other will keep flying high.

How many single transactions contain 1mil of bitcoins? Although it would be harder to identify and definitely not completely verifiable you'd still see it.

If it's a long term investment you're better off to just buy bitcoins.

You're an idiot.

Besides a couple of crinkles in the silvered tape i thought these turned out well. Family were pretty stoked with the bitcoins. They made a great addition to presents.

Check out  and click the little wtf? button in the top right hand corner. That should give you some info on what the graph is telling you.

Watch incoming and outgoing transactions especially when changing in to fiat?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:14:00
Such is life. Someone will always have a little more knowledge then you.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:08:42
ummm... you can withdraw bitcoin without being verified. The verification is just for fiat.
Edit: Just withdrew some to make sure. Definitely can.
