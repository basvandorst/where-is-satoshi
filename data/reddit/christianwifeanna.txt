bitcoin is an invention by my generation, to get money from your generation. 
and you think old people are stupid. LOL.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:34:51

or will there just be 50 kinds?

smart people don't have to fear inflation because along with inflation comes appreciation. so if you have diversified your investments over the years you win. think about what your parents paid for their house, and what it is worth now. slow and steady. that is how wealth is grown.

you wrote "One anonymous Bitcoin holder has even pledged to donate $86 million in BTC to charity"

you think that is charity?
a pledge? you live in a fantasy world.

nobody on reddit made 1000%.
the people who made money don't need to be on reddit anymore because they have lives now. only people on here are broke millennials who watch the crypto as a coping mechanism so they don't have to think about how bad their futures are looking.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:00:46
no thanks, we invest in companies that make and sell a product that people need and they make it or less than they sell it and that is called a margin and if the margin is big and the long term trend is for people to continue to need that product, then that is where we put the money that we make that is above the money that we spend each month. that is called being a grown up.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:47:42
cryptocurrency can only be successful if a dollar equals a dollar. that is what money is. from the beginning, a unit of storage of value because bartering became impractical. currency only works if everyone knows that tomorrow my dollar is still about a dollar. bitcoin? you cant tell me what it will be worth tomorrow. go ahead give it a try, we will check tomorrow and see if you are right. its 10945 right now. take a shot.
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:39:09
ummm. the world population is 7.4 billion.
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:52:13
I really don't think bitcoin does any of that well.
not at all.
I mean what does the term "store" even mean? you put it somewhere and when you come back it is still there.....
you cant spend it...…… you say you can transfer it, but you really cant. I mean you can, but it is awkward. 
and I just watched antonopoulis you tube. a few of them.... I think he is wrong.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:55:51
so its not a bitcoin lambo then?
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:44:53

wow I didn't even know people were bearish and depressed. 
and Im not defending my bank. I really have no strong feelings about my bank. my checks go in, I get no interest, but It is a safe place to keep my money between when I get it and when I spend it. and if I want to buy a house, I can choose to get a mortgage from them for 5% and I can pay it off as slowly as over 30 yrs or as fast as I want if I don't like paying interest. I mean it is what it is. they don't work for free, they have kids to feed, but you think bitcoin exists without people making money to feed their kids????? you pay no matter what, am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:11:27

they don't attack crypto. you ask them their opinion and they tell you their opinion. and if you think that cryptocurrency of any kind will disrupt warren buffets way of living you are way way way past delusional.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:40:53
if you and your bitcoin friends don't care what buffet thinks, why, when he gives his opinions when questioned about bitcoin, do you flip out like a bunch of crybabies? you want everyone to like bitcoin? it is not going to happen. bitcoin holders are a bunch of lazy millennials that don't want to work. you want to get rich quick. it aint gonna happen. go to college or learn a skill that earns you money. live on less than you  make and invest the rest in companies that have a likelihood of future profit.
that is how to get rich. anyone who says otherwise is a fool.

so do you understand that the success of bitcoin does not just depend on bitcoin? it is a part of the economy? and he world? and that to know about the future of bitcoin it might be helpful to listen to folks that understand money and the economy and politics and the world?

you have nothing and say a man who earned 84 billion is stupid.

our investments are very diversified, but the one thing they all have in common is that all the companies have profit, and all of the companies are in sectors that are growing. ie we are still in lumber, but we are not in paper because people are using less paper. bitcoin is something different. when someone invents a cryptocurrency where a usd = on cryptodollar. and that never changes, it will succeed. till then? its just young people trying to get rich without workin.

my husband started a road construction company 20 yrs ago with no money, just a dump truck and grew it to employ 50 people. people need driveways, we make driveways. we charge them enough so that after our expenses we have a margin. and that margin is our income. it is capitalism. it really works really well. don't you have a skill that people would pay you to provide? so you can have income? and about banks? my daughter who has a modest income, just got a mortgage to purchase her first house. she is paying 3.5% interest to the bank and can pay if off early any time she has the money and the desire to...… $200,000 for 800 per month...…. you sure there is a problem with capitalism????

I lost no money in 2008. for one.
and secondly, my children are both in college. my oldest just graduated summa cum laude and is in a phd program at Colorado state university. 
I can afford to pay for my kids to go to college because I don't think money comes from bitcoin fairies.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:51:25
we just built a 2 million dollar cottage.
we could have easily built it with cash.
do you know why we got a mortgage?
because paying 3.5% is less expensive 
than using money we have invested because we are making more than 3.5% on that money. furthermore, if you only keep a cottage for 5 yrs, you will have only paid a small fraction of the 2 million dollars and you will reap the full benefit of the appreciation of the property.
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:43:12

not sure what you mean by "our current system is obviously failing"
I have a bank to hold my money and if I needed a mortgage or a car loan, I would have a place to go to pay to get it. the bank is a business, they have a building and utilities and employees that need to feed their kids... I know they don't do it for free, but if bitcoin got adopted, you think the folks that make it all happen wont need a cut too??   there is not money being made in the transactions?   they do it for charity? and starve? so how is it different than a bank. and where will people go for loans and mortgages. will their still be banks or will bitcoin offer that? will they charge interest too? I bet maybe they will. and if you don't pay your mortgage?  
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:15:34

every time this volatile asset goes up or down a bunch of crybabies chime in on who's fault it is. you think you can prosper in this life if your first response to every predicament is to make excuses?

bitcoiners have a funny perspective on currency value.
look into the reasons for the increase of the costs of good. including all the costs related making and delivering the goods to its end user.
look into why certain things appreciate in value and certain things depreciate in value. 
when you understand all these things you might not continue to use the common bitcoin phrase that USD gets less valuable every year. for people who have set themselves up correctly over their lifetime, the USD goes WAY farther than it ever did.

@_date: 2018-03-06 17:06:58
well he is absolutely right.
gamers and redditors that chase pokemon don't make enough money to invest enough to keep raising the price. and when they grow up and start to have money that they earned by working hard, they wont want to invest it in risky ventures because they will have developed an understanding of risk and reward.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:36:44

because cryptocurrency cant be a reliable form of tender until it has a predictable value. when a new coin comes out and a dollar equals a dollar, it will succeed. until then? its just dumb college kids trying to get out of working by getting rich quick.

the role of debt in business and personal finance.
I don't know where to start......
the astronomical difference in success of someone who knows how to borrow vs a person does not borrow.
astronomical.  the companies that have the leaders that you all secretly admire...… they borrowed.    believe me, they borrowed. It is extremely rare to make a huge company any other way.    way way way less than 1&amp; of companies have never had debt.
