he didn't own the store, just the ATM, so this is more like if you owned a business and someone set up a business across the road from you selling the same thing you sell for cheaper and telling people that they are cheaper than you...in other words...normal competition.
and it doesn't matter if you would be okay with it, i think everyone is upset when someone sells something for cheaper, but thats competition.

yes. there is actually a LOT of legislation about digging up gold. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:20:12
the issue i am seeing is that it assumes you can distinguish the "coin" that was bought at a certain time. in an example given on [this]( article on the subject (the WSJ article is paywalled) they say "Purchasing a $2 cup of coffee with Bitcoins bought for $1 would trigger $1 in capital gains for the coffee drinker and $2 of gross income for the coffee shop. "
now in the simplest transactional model this might work: i buy bitcoins from an exchange i buy something with them.
but in actuality it's a bit more complicated. i buy a bitcoin for a dollar, later i buy another one for 2 dollars, i spend 0.5 bitcoins from the first one on something, i spend 0.5 from the second on something. now i spend 0.5 from the first one and 0.5 from the second one on a cup of coffee at an exchange rate of 3 dollars.
so the rate of bitcoins now is 3 dollars, i bought the first one at one dollar and used half of it meaning there is $1.00 capital gains ((3-1)/2) the second one was bought at $2 and sold at $3 and used half so the capital gains on that is $0.50 ((3-2)/2)
because wallets, to my knowledge, do not care about the "coins" they are using there could be thousands of such maths involved. 
the other issue is the tax rate. as a currency it would be taxed on each transaction and, at least here, that rate is 6% as capital gains the rate is at most 23.8% if held for a year and 43.4 if held for less.
as capital gains you have to keep track of each piece of the transaction and the market price of each piece compared to now and combine them to get the taxable gains and losses. with sales tax you just tax the transaction. it's simpler. i bought something with 2 bitcoins, they were worth 3 dollars each, transaction is worth $6 i pay $0.36 in taxes. simple. also sales tax is declared by the seller not the buyer and is added into the sale, with capital gains you can't, as a seller, add that amount in since it's dependent on what they bought the bitcoins for.
it may be possible to make an application which goes through your blockchain, tracks all transactions and compares them to historical prices (so price when it came in - price when it went out) when two coins merge into 1...well that's a bit tricky...also as far as i can tell moving money from one wallet to another...might be taxable..
anyone here a tax lawyer?

well it's more that bitcoin is different, it's somewhere between fiat and commodity money. this means it's reasonable to tax it as currency or property. it doesn't fit either one very well but it would be better to tax it as currency than property.
the issue he is mentioning here is that the IRS treats it as property while the FDIC treats it as currency. it's the worst of both worlds.

most countries have banned financial organizations from converting bitcoins into fiat currency killing any growth in that area, as few people want to use it if they cannot turn it into local currency.
only a country like russia could ban using bitcoin altogether (since they monitor everything and so far a i know have no free speech guarantee)
america can ban financial organizations from exchanging btc for usd but can't prevent people from trading in btc (since all it takes is a number to make a transaction and the protocol is public) any attempts at stopping transactions would have a strong first amendment challenge.

i find this fascinating. i wonder if there is any research into this effect. *checks* hmm, some googling came across a book "the paradox of choice" which might hint at the reason for this phenomenon (the presence of more choices is more taxing on the individual making them more likely to just back out of the whole thing)

don't think a lawsuit would work here, you lack standing. instead what you want is to lobby for a change to either the IRS ruling to rule it as currency or to the FDIC rules to rule it as property. i think most would agree the former is better (even if money laundering laws are killing exchanges, other bank regulations are none the less a public good)

not sure what you mean by "a global currency" by all accounts it IS a global currency...but most currencies are. if you mean accepted everywhere on the globe as currency...i think that's a little less likely as it would require either EVERYONE to want bitcoin (good luck) or all the governments to tell people they MUST accept bitcoin as currency...which isn't likely to happen.
however if you mean "replace the USD as the global reserve currency" that is a possibility. see government won't want to mandate the acceptance of a currency which competes with their currency, for good reasons and bad reasons, but any fiat currency needs a global reserve currency, something that isn't likely to fluctuate in value, something to anchor their currency to. most countries anchor their currencies to the USD, as such fluctuations in the value of the USD are a problem for the global economy. before this countries anchored their currencies to gold...but this had a lot of problems.
so how would a government go about switching to bitcoin as a global reserve currency and would they want to?
the second part depends on how stable the currency becomes, but switching is mostly just a matter of buying a bunch of bitcoins using their existing USD, they hold these bitcoins in reserve and use them to trade on the global market, for this work countries need to agree they want bitcoin, this could be done via international agreement...only the USD would have much reason to be really against this...but the agreement, and subsequent exchange of dollars to bitcoin would tank the USD, skyrocket the bitcoin cost, and possibly lead to a loss of value for all the countries involved...alternately if it grows organically the currencies could be replaced a bit at a time.
as for how the countries themselves would differ...not much, the US would have less power on the global financial stage, small countries would likely bind the price of their currency to the price of bitcoin (opposed to USD as they do now) this could mean they could more easily do work online if they had computers with internet. 
then there is the nature of bitcoin as a deflationary currency, which promotes hoarding vs spending...how governments feel about this is...messy. their fiat currency can still inflate or deflate the value of their currency at will but it still has a kinda cap based on it's reserve currency...and unlike USD or other such currencies anyone can see how much reserve their country has as well as where it's going. 
but for the most part business would continue as usual.

"I would explain that further, but to be honest, if you can’t make sense of that, a further explanation will also go over your head." we are only in the first paragraph and he is already condescending...not off to a good start...
"If I need to cite an example to illustrate this point please exit this post directly." and the condescension train just keeps on going.
the rest of the article seems to be absent this condescension opting instead for pundit style preaching but overall his message is sound, the increase in price has more to do with the increase in user adoption and is pretty much expected. you can also tell how much of the market is speculation by how much the price drops when people expect folks are gonna start selling. (such as when it hit dollar parity, when it hit gold parity, when silk road was closed, etc)
this most recent one was a 20% drop so around that much is speculation, these small bubble pops are good and healthy and show the actual strength of the market.
so he is right it's mass adoption, but it's also bubbly adoption. not a huge bubble of speculation, a rising tide of usefulness with bits of bubbling.

market cap is 12 billion? why?
assuming a limit of 1 satoshi/US penny then the theoretical limit for bitcoin after the 27 million mark is 2.7 x 10^13 USD or 270,000,000,000,000 or 270 quadrillion USD

@_date: 2013-11-29 00:48:11
i think we will hit a barrier around $1,000,000.00/BTC this is the point that 1 satoshi=1 penny. if it rises above this point a protocol change would be needed to keep up (because people could no longer reliably convert USD into BTC) most don't worry much about the price of bitcoin because if $1=1BTC or 0.00001BTC doesn't matter much so long as they can convert USD (or their local currency) into BTC. the point for doing that keeps moving further and further down the number line and eventually it will hit the satoshi floor.

hmm...my first thought was "if everyone quits mining the currency can't be processed" but then i remembered that difficulty is proportional to number of people mining, so if a bunch of people quit mining, difficulty would drop, and it would once again be profitable to mine.
i do so love bitcoin, it gives me a total nerd-on. when i started getting into the protocol and working through the source code...you could easily write a whole CS class(no, not C just on this. from it's hash tables to it's scripting language, to it's P2P system...it is truly beautiful.
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:44:58
well so too does cash, and some people do offer to pay people "under the table" tax evasion is unlikely to be the motivator...i think it's more to do with control. who has it, who wants it, and who is losing it. everything in the WORLD runs on the dollar, so if you control the dollar well you are quite powerful arent you? you can create inflation and deflation at will (well at will and a few years...getting money out of circulation takes time) you also have quite a bit of sway at the bargaining table "oh you have $200 mil worth of government bonds, man sure would suck if inflation made those only worth 100 million eh?" (course that threat would be largely empty, inflating and deflating takes a lot of work and is not without it's consequences, and our government can't even pass a fucking budget) 
but the government has the power to stabilize markets if things go bad (one of the reasons we couldn't get out of a deflationary spiral in the great depression was the inability to print more money and trigger inflation because of the gold standard) if they do not control the means of commerce they lose this power, so this has some people, many of them perfectly well intentioned, in a bit of a panic.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:22:39
i think the bacteria in container analogy is good to explain the growth of bitcoin, as it is we can divide bitcoins as much as we want til we get to a satoshi, so we just buy a dollar's worth and who cares how many bitcoins that is. but when we hit a satoshi and it is now worth more than a penny...we now we have an issue. now demand drops because the price is too high, this pushes the price back down until we reach an equilibrium (in a perfect world full of rational people...in the real world we hit the wall and everyone freaks the fuck out and starts selling and the price plummets and  the haters go "i told you so the bitcoin bubble has burst trololololololol" then a recovery and next time we hit the wall we expect it and no one flips out.) but that's just my guess...i have no idea what the future holds.

someone has to lose, the money doesn't just come out of no where.
if you sold high, and bought low you made a profit and didn't lose any bitcoins. you may have even bought back your own coins
so you sold at 2200 bought at 800 you have the same number of coins but an extra $400. where did it come from? i feel like someone had to have lost $400 for you to have gained it.
but maybe it's because of the growth of the value of bitcoin, someone lost $400 but gained something they wanted even more (bitcoins) which they value as equal to or greater than the $400. this i would be the exchanges?
@_date: 2013-10-06 04:42:38
well if they liquidate all at once this could cause a dip in the bitcoin market price...which would be a good time to buy.

* ledger is public so when all transactions become required to be tied to a person the ledger will be the greatest surveillance tool yet
* when bitcoin gets very popular it will be harder to make patches as it will need everyone to switch to the new mechanism
* no one has any idea what it's worth so speculation is rampant (estimates of worth vary from "useless" to "second coming of christ")
* if you lose your wallet neither you nor anyone else can EVER get that money back...losing your digital wallet isn't like losing a physical wallet...it's like burning a physical wallet with all the money in it.
* new people are making banks, which is good, but they are people who have no idea how to run a bank...like wild west banks...as such they are getting robbed...still a nicer robbery than meat world robberies...
* bitcoins nearly unlimited divisibility makes it harder to figure out what it's worth (bitcoins have value...but what value...no one knows) since until we are regularly dealing with satoshis we won't ever feel the need to worry about rising cost of bitcoins.
* mainstream media...just in general...(not a fault of bitcoin...but an issue for it.)
overall the code is beautiful, the protocol is awesome. you could do whole CIS semesters  on the bitcoin code, analyzing the code should be part of EVERY c++ class. while bitcoins themselves could fill at least a few econ classes.

i guarantee, you are in possession of a dollar bill or coin that was, at some point, stolen from another person and never returned. and if you have a 20 there is a high probability it was used in the purchase (and possibly the USE) of narcotics.
also if you have coins a pretty good probability that at least one of them has passed through a child's digestive system, an even higher probability that one has gone through a sewage system.
the point is we don't need to know the history of the coins and bills we use, and we don't need to know if someone at some point in the lifetime of this piece of currency stole it and didn't return it. 
imagine if you had to research the history of every bill you ever received just to run a garage sale..and if you didn't and it was found that one of those bills were stolen you were liable. you sure wouldn't wanna accept cash would you?
@_date: 2013-08-28 14:51:28
i think a federal reserve is actually inevitable (remember, we have a federal reserve of raisins...) because this allows governments to regulate the cost of money by increasing or decreasing available supply (remember that money which is horded is the same as money which doesn't exist, so reserving bitcoins and releasing them would allow governments to inflate or deflate the currency)

was studying the bitcoin protocol not too long ago to better understand the namecoin protocol which is what i was actively working on. i found the protocol specification + wireshark + reading the code to be the best way to learn. also sometimes asking questions helps.
i also found the bitcoin protocol to fucking awesome. it is a thing of beauty and should be studied in every CIS class. it has everything: stacks, sockets, irc, merkel trees, berkley db, packet routing and p2p, and it's own scripting language. it's some really cool code.

was just gonna mention that, sadly RFID tags are kinda expensive (not the ones you normally see on products in stores that make the bars go off, those are very simple tags with only one real tone, but even those are too expensive to put on every product, which is why they are only on highly stolen items) and not worth the added cost. a bag checker like sam's club has would probably be fine, the point of checking the blockchain was that it would produce an automatic list of everything that the person bought so they can check it against the things in the cart.
this system require minimal work from the stores computer (just translating the list of addresses to a description of physical goods) and you can produce a receipt at any time, including for audits (because who keeps paper receipts?) at no point does the customer's app have to interface with the store's computer either which keeps implementation simple.
if you wanna get more fancy, you can put the weight of the item into the store's computer(think stores with self checkouts already do this) and then when the customer leaves they can place their items on a scale, if the weight matches the expected weight within a certain degree of error they can go, if it deviates too much a person is sent to check them.

not sure yours is exactly correct or their exactly wrong.
the main thing that both ignore is that USD is a good, money exchangers and banks are a service. so the bottom part is more accurate we are exchanging bitcoin for USD as a good and the other way around, both of those things can themselves be used to trade for goods and services.
so a bitcoin only economy looks like the vaginal model at the bottom, but so too does a USD only economy. of course when you have more people it starts to look more like a chainmail model.
the tricker area is really the interface between bitcoin&lt;--&gt;bitcoin interactions and fiat&lt;--&gt;fiat interactions that is the only reason for the money transmitters, money exchangers, and banks is to serve as a bridge between these two networks, or even between different fiat networks (such as USD to Yen or Euro, or whatever) you have vagina chainmail networks for each of the currencies and you need someone to sew these two things together.

i think they are good but for a different reason:
when you have a speculation bubble (yes we have some, no not all of bitcoin is one) you get people who are trying to turn a quick buck, as more of them buy in the bubble inflates, but then when an event happens that the speculators believe will lead to selling (silk road shutting down, gold parity, etc) some of them sell, price drops, more of them sell til most the speculators are gone. 
the reason this is good is because after a "crash" we see how much of the market was speculation, if bitcoin were 100% speculation as some think then one crash would lead to nearly everyone selling in a huge selling frenzy that would bring the price of bitcoin down to ~0. instead we see a smaller 20% drop or so, so 80% is legitimate and the speculation is smaller 20% or so.
and of course when the speculators sell high they will then buy back up when it dropped as a result, so long as they believe the price will go back up. so they sold high, bought low, and made a profit on the crash, they bought back in so the price went back to where it was and people using it for legitimate uses aren't losing out, so...win-win (except maybe the exchanges...i'm not sure how but i feel they lose in this)
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:03:52


i should point out i am one of those people. well to a degree. the ability of a country to print or destroy their money to increase or decrease the amount in circulation and thus create inflation and deflation to encourage spending or saving is very useful. if we were able to do that back in the great depression we could have gotten out of the deflationary spiral that was choking the economy at the time.
the ability to print money makes a nice short term solution to ease pressure and encourage spending.

this is awesome. i have been thinking of doing the same thing since i learned how to make leather and soap and other sundry things and thought this could be of use to folks down on their luck. but i didn't have the money to make it a reality.
being able to support yourself is a great thing, when you can do so without the need of money, without needing to beg or live on others' scraps, it's liberating. 
though i'm still learning (i have yet to learn to hunt and trap which i feel will be a much needed skill, but i have learned how to grow food and how to make a rather effective fertilizer from urine (6-1 water-urine ratio)) but when given a deer i could make glue, leather, buttons (if it's male), string and rope, candles (except the wick), soap, and obviously meat. course same is true of a bull.
leather and fur is good for low resource living as it doesn't need the facilities that cloth does.
also if your forest has maple you can make maple syrup and maple sugar a nice source of sugar you can make locally, and maple syrup sells rather well so tapping and refining sap could be a useful skill.(my skills start at maple syrup i'm afraid, i have no experience yet of tapping a tree or refining syrup)

can you claim a wallet is seized if someone can put money into it? or will they be using the state of the blockchain at the point of the arrest?

"Even if the FBI is not able to transfer the money, merely having possession of the wallet file itself is enough to prevent the coins being spent. The Bureau is in a position equivalent to having seized a safe belonging to a suspect with no idea of the combination – and no hope of forcing it open any other way."
*shakes head* come on guardian...
those coins are not seized, trying to correlate it to physical things like a safe is to miss the point. if he knows the keys (and i would hope he does) he doesn't NEED the wallet file, he could transfer the money out from a computer in prison, he could tell someone else the key and THEY could transfer the money out.
the closest thing i could think to correlate it to would be them saying they have his bank account number written in code on a piece of paper and saying they have seized his bank account.

i was worried cryptolocker was now encrypting people's wallets locking up people's money if they haven't committed the key to memory.

the biggest issue with zero trust markets is that any party can lie. if i send you a chicken egg you can just say i didn't or just refuse to give me the money. any case where one party holds all the cards (such as having the money and the good) there is no reason for that party to give anything to the other, he has everything he needs. markets run on trust, thats why the ranking system and escrow in SR, even that wasn't perfect but it beats a sharp stick in the eye.
this is actually the reason we have courts in the white market, and the reason they use violence in the black market. there has to be some repercussion for cheating or there would be no reason not to do it.
