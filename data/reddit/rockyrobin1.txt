Can you send me fiat so we an arbitrage this 30% price difference?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:15:04
May I ask if the anticipated drop to 8k will still happen?  Been patiently waiting for a month ;)
Or has it been widely accepted so now it won’t happen?
I’d like to get back in - and this time I will hold!
I won’t get scared and sell (a 3rd time...) and I won’t day trade!

Only a bitcoin millionaire could afford to buy in the old city!
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:27:58
Good. I’ve been patiently waiting weeks for a crash. I want back in. All in this time.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:04:38
That’s enough of your cheek r3kl355.
Of course I may just be seeing a pattern because I want to.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:44:45
If it breaks then it will be because of something that was considered a stretch so it’s definitely worth keeping in mind...

@_date: 2018-01-16 22:40:23
I feel like I should have done that this morning when 10% down. Now at 30% it seems riskier. It could bounce back as I’m sleeping and I miss the re-entry after having cemented my losses.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:13:29
Have you bought back in?
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:35:34
Did you notice shortly after you posted your sell advice that the markets jumped back to recover half the losses?
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:00:50
Wall Street bonuses.

Can’t help. Soz.

Yeah right. But accountants don’t take any responsibility. 
If you’re an accountant why not answer the question relevant to your state?
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:44:10
Did you read the other posts?
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:19:20
Not this time :)
I did the last two times :(
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:40:10
Lol! TA’s suggested 8 was likely.  Some even claimed 5. I was aiming for 9500.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:13:28
I’ve signed up to a (likely) scam. I want to name them so others don’t get burnt.
Equally I’ve never seen anyone mention them so I don’t want to publicise them as there are plenty of people more gullible than me.
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:29:59
Why is that related to the question?
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:40:43
Taking your phone to the Wetherspoon toilets isn’t supporting evidence to the story :)
We know it’s in the paper as the op kindly provided a link.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:53:44
Yeah I’ve tried that before and got burnt each time.
I’m sitting :/
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:59:49
See, now you’ve been a very helpful member of Reddit instead of a dick like me.

Good one
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:29:43
I never understood why people though bankers would pump their bonuses in anyway.
Not that Wall Street is awake at 0900GMT anyway.
They’d only do that if they could guarantee the price would boom.
Unless they are tree shaking so they can get in cheaper later.

What is wrong with people tonight?
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:52:45
Now you’ve taken us full circle :)
Too many conflicting responses.
If you exchange btc for eth, is this taxable? And how do you even go about calculating the profit?
More importantly to calculate any loss and can that loss be offset against profits?
If btc/eth is a barter transaction and taxable that kinda kills off day trading.
Does the same barter tax apply to bankers and high frequency trading bots?
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:37:58
You’re a fucking idiot
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:09:49

@_date: 2018-01-11 08:33:58
The implication is clearly that you don’t volunteer to pay tax.
Don’t make excuses for him.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:52:07
So I wouldn’t be able to spend crypto? So fiat is better?
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:48:13

I’ve heard the us/terror idea a few times. I don’t buy this scenario as the fbi legitimised bitcoins. Besides, any good criminal would be into Monero etc.
Then there’s the camp that expect any external influence to strengthen bitcoin. I guess akin to holding gold during wartime.
Anyway, I appreciate your considered opinion/response.

Bitcoin has thought of that and is deflatory.

Of course. I own my company and sign off on taxes related to that company at the year end. I have other income unrelated to that company and also sign off on that too.
I don’t earn enough to be creative with my accounting and I quite like living in a nice well lit neighbourhood with a national house service.
Why on earth would I not want to pay taxes?

Historical baseline?
It’s new. The baseline is therefore 0.

FYI my train gets in soon so I’ll have to stop playing your games.

That’s something for me to mull over. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:21:07
Sort of but no. Everything new has a baseline of 0. It just depends how long it takes to grow up, based on how different it is.
When crypto matures you may be able to apply tried and tested share tricks. Or you may not, after all Bitcoin is not an asset with intrinsic value.
Certainly whilst we’re dealing with an infant we can’t assume to apply grown up rules.

You have few options. Restricting yourself to PayPal makes it harder.
I won’t sell you any via PayPal as you can complain to PayPal and get your money back.
They won’t delete your files after 24 hours as they will then lose any chance of getting any payment from you.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:13:09
How much lower and for how much longer will it drop?
I’ve been caught before trying to sell in order to buy back in.

What does this mean?
It’s not illegal tender?
Surely only local fiat is legal tender? Ignoring things like stamps which are legal tender in the uk.
Surely bitcoin is as legal as buttons, should you wish to accept buttons...

You need to be more specific with your timeframe.

If they could exchange the fiat for crypto.
It would be harder to transfer fiat to their own account.
So it would seem traditional banking is more secure.
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:38:27
Now your Just deviating and stating obvious facts to backtrack.
I’ve never been to the moon. Do I win?
To get you back to the original point, why was the posters question in any way helpful to the OP?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:12:58
I think I misread and (wrongly) assumed you were already with Coinbase in which case the 2 day turnaround is usually fast enough for most people.
I don’t know what current queues are like for new subscribers.
I’ve only ever used Coinbase to interface with fiat so I’ll stfu now.

@_date: 2018-01-02 17:57:54
Tax is tax. It doesn’t matter if you are paid dollars or buttons, the same tax rate applies.
Cap gains tax isn’t relevant here.
The laws will catch up.
Many will get away with it.
Some will be caught a few years down the line owing thousands and no capacity to pay the tax due.

@_date: 2018-01-03 21:21:51
Hence being very open and asking a question you bubble head.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:02:11
I think you may lose your cash whilst learning to trade so maybe that’s not a good idea.
Take out half. Keep 1 btc. The rest spread around the top 2~5 Cryptos.
Out of the half that’s now cash. Take half that cash for life. The rest (1/4 of the total) keep on an exchange on low buy orders. Cryptos can and do crash, maybe 40%. Sometimes the crash lasts for days or weeks. Other times seconds whilst you are sleeping. Over the next 12 months one of the top 5 cryptos will crash by 40%.
Just ideas.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:28:10
1 btc to find 1 million btc?
Clearly not that interested in recovering it then.
Anyone that could recover it will just take it for themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:14:18
I wouldn’t :( sorry.
If we were in the same country, instant bank transfer, but the risk would all be with you.

No. But I did speak to their live chat after reading your post.

It’s a nice try. Maybe your interpretation will win out after a few cases.
Right now people have to go with the spirit of the law. Sadly, as it eats all profits from day trading (50% are losses...)

You were scammed. Theft. Me splitting hairs won’t help or make you feel better.
As you may imagine there are no shortage of stories like this most days and no one has any way to tell part the scammers vs victims. Your choice of wording helped me make up mind.
You don’t suck. You may feel low but that doesn’t mean you suck.
Scammers suck. Sadly it will make them feel good.
Where did you get your coin from?
Bitcoin is not anonymous.

That’s all it takes for a revolution.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:24:01
So you have evidence you had the original coin via Coinbase.
You can now view the transaction to your paper wallet.
And you can show the transaction away from your paper wallet.
If the fbi can sell bitcoin and bankers can short bitcoin then this must have some weight with the police.

It means a great deal. It has set a precedence.

Coinbase are having problems right now.
It’s not even high volumes to blame this time.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:44:19
I’ve always wondered about the 51%.
Is that of nodes that anyone can partake in?
Or just miners?  Or something else?
Could you override the 21m limit with 51%?
Roll back transactions? Steal the genesis account?
What can you do with 51%?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:50:20
What your describing isn’t a scam, it’s theft. That was my point.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:27:47
I guess we should agree to disagree
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:40:07
You said ‘to a scam’ and then you say it was your ‘ex’.
Ok, it’s Christmas I’ll send you half a bitcoin.
