A crawler wouldn't prove that it's trustworthy source or usable :/ That's why the BTC community needs to come together and help us list them all here

Apparently not on their online shop :/

It states $60 on their their site. Most probably it's there to make customer acquisition worthwhile their efforts. 
Anyone willing to put less than $60 is not their audience.. one might want to check out Indacoin ( [ ) in that case.. or CEX if he/she resides in the US ([ ) .. Both are great solutions

Actually, we did not included the Nano X on purpose. We feel that anything connected to a bluetooth device just causes an extra security risk, especially if you're holding 10s of thousands. 
Don't get us wrong, it's a fantastic device. Great On-the-go features too, bt honestly, for security sake, we prefer the Nano S. Some might agree, others don't, but that's what we recommend. You can check our Nano X review here:

We're sorry to hear that. We take our users feedback very seriously. What more would you like to see included in these reviews?

We would image so.. but really, do you think it was all due to a pump and dump group?

We get your point, but technically that is already happening with traditional currency.. unless you pay cash that is. However, when you pay with your credit card, the bank always takes a percentage fee from whatever you spend. It doesn't take it from the person who is buying, it just takes it from the person who is selling. 
At least with crypto, the shared are split evenly with the miners, and taken by a single corporate entity
