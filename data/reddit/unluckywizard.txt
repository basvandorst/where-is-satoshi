You have no idea what you're talking about. Blockchain is a safe wallet
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:26:39
I have been running around all night like this
@_date: 2013-03-12 08:06:33
I was working with a bit more than that actually and I caught it right as it started to rise again but I was watching the ticker and there were some huge buys when it started rising again compared to mine.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:20:41
No, it isn't. At all
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:40:53
Sell to btc-e everyone!
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:53:12
its invested at 71.5 usd :,(
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:36:58
I gained 490 and just traded to bitstamp waiting on confirmations so i can sell back at 93. Sold 2000 at 92 bought at 75.5 and am selling at 94 on bitstamp. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:27:09
I have around 200
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:03:32
Wayyyyyy lower huh?
@_date: 2013-08-14 16:32:10
prove it...you can't ;)
@_date: 2013-04-01 01:57:09
You'll only make a few bucks at most
@_date: 2013-06-26 10:44:40
You're quite odd and extremely opinionated.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:12:55
so i'm am gonna steal your guys idea
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:01:52
mmmmmooooooonnnnnnneeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyy is what's going on
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:43:07
Bank accounts don't get hacked online daily people need better passwords.
@_date: 2013-06-15 17:56:46
You are right, I just said gold because it was easier. None the less, any dollar is backed by collateral value (much of which is gold). My previous statement still stands that the dollar is just a transmitter of value but that currencies are not backed entirely on gold is a good point to make.
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:14:35
...if you wanted to do this transaction using a debit card it would go like this. Parking cost $1. You pay that but the actual parking company would only receive $.30. With btc thy would get everything
@_date: 2013-06-15 23:29:58
They trade often is all it means
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:14:10
Like within the hour new lol
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:33:47
it really wasnt that big of a drop...if it starts dropping past 15 points send funds to btc and sell immediately because those prices will still be high
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:20:22
:) awesome
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:23:48
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:43:20
Give me an example
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:41:49
not luck!
@_date: 2013-04-26 10:20:12
Lol insanity
@_date: 2013-03-08 22:19:27
So does Wall Street 
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:30:29
ma nigga
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:21:06
Those people are the same ones that "didn't give a fuck" about the Internet...typing in a website and sending a email? why the fuck would they do that when they can just pick up your phone and call. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:54:04
it is going back up though I know it will I believe
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:43:07
all my other investments fail but bitcoin seems to be where all my luck was hiding haha 
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:49:29
Seriously though what the fuck are they talking about I turned it off within a minute. You can pay you electricity with bitcoin, you can pay your rent with it, you can buy amc gift cards to see movies this summer, and you can damn sure buy groceries with giftcards as well. GYFT...
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:07:20
Do you guys need help out there? I live in tallahassee and have been into bitcoins forever and am looking for a job related to it somehow
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:09:01
i was just saying that because you are always on the btc troll box, no offense ment 
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:37:38
I saw it start to drop and sold  almost all my btc then caught it pretty low and then had a very lucky guess on an order at 46 and cashed out everything bought 
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:41:08
serious I am stressing about what do with my taxes
@_date: 2013-03-08 00:49:46
A real shit show for sure
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:39:56
and the same ting that happened then will happen again
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:27:45
I had 10,000...whyyyyyy :/
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:12:33
But then again no taxes, bank fees, blah blah
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:39:45
Go to cvs it's even better
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:22:10
Weird timing after a week? No that is good customer support you jackass
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:36:24
haha you obviously don't watch currency exchanges...the dollar dips and it isn't like stores scramble to change prices. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE IS WHAT BUSINESSES USE
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:38:05
i made almost 10 k on this panic almost 15 on the last
@_date: 2013-06-15 20:08:44
No, that is completely untrue. 
"The Congress has specified that Federal Reserve Banks must hold collateral equal in value to the Federal Reserve notes that the Federal Reserve Bank puts in to circulation. "
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:09:05
hahaha well he said we could gloat 
@_date: 2013-03-23 03:43:46
I just guess really. I make buy orders on mxgox when i think it is at its lowest for market price and then guess a sell price at what I think the high will be
@_date: 2013-03-12 04:12:54
 Yeah btc e is nice, while you're there buy some ltc 
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:22:45
Doesn't even work on every droid douche
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:09:28
not at all
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:42:26
it is not confusing at all, what do you need help with?
@_date: 2013-06-15 22:50:03
What point are you disproving? dollars are still transmitting value of something else, just like I said.
@_date: 2013-06-26 08:21:37
I just used blueskytraders and it was amazing. It took less than 12 hours and the charged less than 2%
@_date: 2013-05-06 22:09:50
Discussion or gtfo! 
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:56:01
They claim it is not possible for them to implement an iOS app at this time. I have a ton of experience with iOS coding and jail breaking, I think it is horseshit. They at least could give an address to send the funds to but really they need to just bring up the blockchain app and let us enter the money bada Ning bada boom. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:32:12
I love okpay and wire much more than 6,000 thru them weekly
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:51:48
ya it is 
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:45:43
Seriously? They can't just give a address to send to from my block chain app??? Ridiculous 
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:47:16
What are you even talking about
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:43:15
you guys fucking rock that is smart also, everyone needs to know about bit coin not just people online
@_date: 2013-03-06 22:31:31
Bitinstant was good for once today
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:00:40
it went to 75 then started rising again I saw it bouncing around 78 then back to 75 and bought. good guess 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:32:19
Damn I'm gonna do this shit
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:49:43
@_date: 2013-08-05 18:21:08
Good job you fucked up wikipedia
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:00:25
but you're a troll 
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:49:43
hahaha awesome
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:10:35
when it comes down to it, usd euro yen ect are all "transmitters" of the value of gold. by your logic dollars are just a storage of value as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:06:43
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:20:05
I used bitinstant back a while ago and yeah it's fine. Okpay is great but are very careful about money laundering. They don't allow daily transactions of 2k but would be fine with a weekly transaction of 10k in my experience 
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:40:33
It's my job haha I dropped out of college to trade bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:02:50
The weighted average has never been anywhere near 150$. Please don't say things that might sway people away from a currency when you haven't even researched anything.
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:23:26
I wish I had a job bitcoin related but no I just day trade. I know you don't seriously think I work there
