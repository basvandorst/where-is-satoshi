You live up to your username 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:21:06
Thanks for the warning! I didn’t click.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:43:18
Thanks bro! You too!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:12
Or maybe you shoulda listened when people said not to invest more than you can afford.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:59
Yeah screw that. I cut my losses the very second I could. I’ll buy back in at the floor.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:24
At which point, mining BTC on home computers could become reasonable again. Hmm... perhaps this correction isn’t ALL bad.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:43:53
Yeah that’s a good point. I’m not gonna sell. I’ll just hold.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:08:56
Oh so I’ll automatically have $1000 worth of BTC if the worth goes up high enough.
So basically the only way to ever see any physical money from BTC is to cash out what you have? You can’t really cash out the profit and leave seed money?
I apologize for being so uninformed at this.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:00:00
Is it going to be a cloud mining setup? I’d be interested in using your services if you actually get it going.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:08:20
The prophecy has been fulfilled!
All hail The Hypnotoad!
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:39:28
Can you? I’m asking legitimately. Can a minor even issue a lawsuit, especially after he commits fraud?
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:58:20
Hey man send it my way instead
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:34:11
That’s quite possibly the most 90’s thing I’ve ever seen.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:23:13
You must be new.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:08
Pretty sure most of us are already taking a big cut. This entire week has been a big cut.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:33:45
Because he doesn’t know much about BTC and I barely know anything about it. But if it seems profitable, I may buy a rig and get into mining too.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:58:24
I actually really like this advice. Thank you for that man. Bolstered my confidence :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:19:41
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:01:28
I got most of my money back so yeah I’m stoked :) I’ll buy in wherever it lands.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:25:31
I think it’s a good reminder not to put your faith in money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:41:20
Only about 600 bucks worth. I know that’s not much, haha. But I’m of the belief that you should only invest what you can afford to lose. So yeah, I’m hoping to get the most bang for my buck.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:50:00
Most of those are chocolate. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:36:31
Yeah that makes sense. Thanks! I’m personally just looking for the best time to buy more. It’s hard to know when that is though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:08
U mad?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:11:13
������ that was great
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:30:17
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:42:53
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:51:16
They musta been outta O’s.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:59:37
Dorp 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:30:41
My head...
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:29:10
And you plan to ride these highs and lows for the next hundred years?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:39:39
That’s probably a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:36:51
Yeah but at least he’s old enough to keep his coins.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:36:21
I’ll take that as a “no”
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:28
It’ll be ok man. Give it a little time. I promise you it’ll go back up.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:18:48
They’re allowed to do that? Was that to keep people from buying at 9k?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:23
Does this answer your question:
...Because it shouldn’t.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:12
Well it certainly isn’t good for business.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:36:33
Agreed. It’s very fishy. I don’t like investing on an exchange that’s doing weird stuff and showing favoritism.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:21:21
Oh! I see now. I’m starting to get it now... that wouldn’t be a wise way to invest in BTC because there’s no guarantee it’ll dip like that again. So it’s better to pretty much do nothing. Invest and sit on it, and then invest more later.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:35:15
Any little bit helps! Lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:27:51
Really? Wow. I figured it’d be sooner. Especially since entire governments are jumping in on the act, and bitcoin is about to enter the Wallstreet game.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:47
Wow. The crap is hitting the fan 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:49:47
Oh ok. Thanks! So is it good or bad?
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:32:22
Ah. Gotcha. Yeah that dude’s a jerk. I feel bad for whoever buys it. Anyway to report that?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:53:43
Is that good or bad? Sorry I’m not following.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:08:04
The sweater may be ugly, but she ain’t.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:03:33
Wooo! Abandon ship! /s
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:19:19
So wait, we should all sell, not buy?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:06:59
Lol. Good use of the meme.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:32:18
So like, how much litecoin can you make in a day on litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:00:14
Can somebody explain to me what this is about? I know all the BCH/Coinbase stuff, but what’s going on with the block chain?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:39
Oh so now you want to listen? When we all warned you again and again, DONT INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE! You weren’t listening. 
*rubs temples*
How about you just wait and go do something else? It’ll go back up. Give it time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:28:39
Can you explain why you think that? I’m just wondering cuz I’ve heard a few people say it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:23:14
There’s nothing we can do. Also I’m pretty sure what you did was illegal.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:57:28
That’s awesome! Where’d you find that art? I’d like one  of those paintings too!
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:26:50
What is this exactly? A scam or something?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:35:26
Good on ya! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:11:14
Yeah that sounds pretty smart. Maybe I’ll buy in now instead of waiting till morning.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:14:52
Yeah probably. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:16
It’ll be fine. Grab a drink and watch some Netflix. In a few days we’ll be back in action.
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:05:47
How come you guys are turning on each other? You both support Bitcoin. Wouldn’t it make more sense to argue with the “BTC is Doomed!” people?
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:18:14
Release it on Switch! I’ll buy it! ��
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:01:39
No harm in buying on the way down.
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:51:31
Thanks, for answering my noob question. Welcome to reddit.
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:59:30
So you’re saying “stupid questions attract stupid people”? Fair enough I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:15:18
This analogy hurts BTC more than it helps.
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:49:45
So when does it end? What breaks the cycle?
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:37:26
Ugh. I wish I was better at understanding bitcoin and stock. But anyway, thank you. What you said actually made sense.
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:38:52
You’re buying on the upswing? Isn’t it typically better to but on the way down?
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:31:38
This pattern has been going downhill since season 3.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:59:08
Titties are nice :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:00:44
Technically wouldn’t the next best time be 19 years, 11 months, 31 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds ago?
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:34:27
This conversation reads funnier if you imagine he’s being txted by a random number.
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:12:02
Actually this IS my day job.
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:42:36
Oof. I didn’t even think of that. ��‍♂️ I was just trying to make a play on the “Kiss Me I’m Irish” expression. ��
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:57:33
No you’re absolutely right. I’ll keep that in mind for future designs. (Although at the least it could be worn around family (especially this time of year), to raise some BTC talking points.)
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:32:37

@_date: 2019-01-03 05:37:21
Hey TC, I just wanna say that you’re the first person I’ve seen on here that really seems to know his stuff. And I mean that sincerely. 
Do you mind if I ask how you learned your crypto investing strategies? Is there a book you recommend?
And what’re your thoughts on Bitcoin Cash? Is it worth investing in?
@_date: 2019-01-22 07:52:37
Thanks. I appreciate the tip ��
@_date: 2019-01-08 05:47:08
I was waiting for someone to finally get it! Yes! You got it ��
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:52:57
Tell him to be careful, because he may have to pay Capital Gains tax on selling a chunk of BTC that large.
Also ask him to toss a little my way ��
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:56:37
Well, you’ve got me there. I guess that’s one thing BTC can’t do.
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:12:45
Why is it written in Goosebumps font? ��
@_date: 2019-01-22 07:50:48
Oh hey thanks! Sorry I didn’t thank you sooner, but I hadn’t been on Reddit so I never saw it. Thanks ��
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:11:54
I sincerely wasn’t begging. I hadn’t read that rule so I deleted the post. But I apologize nonetheless.
@_date: 2019-01-09 02:33:47
I just want to say a huge thanks to those that supported. And to everyone that liked my painting. This is the best Reddit out there ��
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:10:12
Lol thanks ��
@_date: 2019-01-22 07:51:42
Literally had no idea this existed. Wow. Thanks bro ��
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:17:15
Kratos, is that you?
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:24:09
Did I already miss all the tips?
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:53:21
Wow that’s very encouraging! You seem pretty smart, so hopefully you won’t mind if i ask a question or two. Lol. 
1. Do you recommend diversifying your portfolio with multiple coins outside BTC?
2. And is there a calculator someplace that’ll let me see what my coin is worth at what price?
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:30:50
“drinks dip”
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:43:53
How about you calm down and stop embarrassing yourself.
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:37:46
@_date: 2018-12-26 09:56:53
You sir, are a scholar and a gentleman. Enjoy your day ��
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:45:36
Mind if I ask how much you invested at $3200, or is that personal? Either way, congrats at predicting the bottom! ��
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:38:50
Speak for yourself. I bought in at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:22:08
Thanks a ton man �� You’ve taught me a lot and I appreciate it!
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:57:12
I don’t even get it? Are you saying something’s wrong with BTC? Isn’t it on the upswing?
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:06:39
Those are actually pretty cool. I’ve got one in gold, silver, and bronze colors.
(Just as long as nobody here thinks that’s an actual Bitcoin.)
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:43:35
That’s really quite unnecessary. It was an honest mistake dude.
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:35:24
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2018-12-26 09:55:51
Thank you kindly! And have a wonderful day! :)
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:21:59
People still hodling should be kicking themselves for missing out on multiple opportune times to sell.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:47:40
Thanks bro :)
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:37:16
Nah. I think it’s too soon. Maybe it’ll dip around tax time, but not this soon.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:19:09
I’m in. It’ll be an interesting sociology experiment.
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:40:15
Sure... “women” ��
