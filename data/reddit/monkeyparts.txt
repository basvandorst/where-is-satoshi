But you still have to deal with these issues if you want to transfer money into or out of Bitcoin. I'm not knocking the concept of Bitcoin, I'm merely stating that these are factors which the average person may find a little daunting.

It's a good point, and I agree it won't be used to help their *public* image. But we all know the public doesn't have any power or oversight towards them. It's a select few who disseminate this kind of information and they choose whom they impart it to.

I undertsand why it's the way it is (add another 2 weeks for the research I did before I took the plunge). But at this point, the bar to entry for the average consumer is a little high. Hopefully as it grows things get a little easier, though I doubt established financial entities are going to aid in any way.

Yeah, I'm happy with it. Once I get to the next service level transactions should be a lot quicker.

Yeah, but you're skipping over the work to get to that point. I just started using it through coinbase. After trying the official client and giving up on it because it took days to update the blockchain I switched to electrum. Then it took a week to get my bank account verified through coinbase, then another week to purchase and receive a few coins. I initiated a transfer last night to my private wallet and ten hours later it's still pending according to the coinbase site. Sure, once you have coins, transactions are smoother but getting to that point isn't exactly easy or quick.

Yeah, the press outfits need to start taking OPSEC very seriously. I'm sure that interview didn't help him.

The timing is rather funny. The NSA is going through shit politically. Drop this little present off and say 'look guys, see what we can do?'
