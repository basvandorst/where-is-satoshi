Hmm ok. Yeah took about 13 days for me I think. Sorry man hope it gets sorted soon
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:00:11
Not yet. But theyre coming...soon.

Happened to me too. Just leave it for a couple weeks and it will get kicked out again. It sucks but thats the way it is now. People who suggest tx accelerators for a 1.6btc transaction must not understand the fee is anyhwere from 800 to 3000usd+ depending on how fast you want it done. Hardly worth it.

Great read. Just this week I was thinking about a safe deposit box. Not anymore...
Here's another link for anyone who doesn't want to have to open an account with nytimes.om just to read the article.

Valid question. Btc pumping pretty hard right now with dominance already above 64pct. Quite likely there will be a small retracement as btc starts bleeding into alts soon. With that in mind, btc will probably be at new ath by Christmas, so maybe decide how much you're willing to risk missing out on the continued growth waiting for the perfect moment to jump in.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:55:20
Can you suggest which transaction accelerator to use? One of them has a fee that ranges from 600 usd to 8,000 usd depending on how fast you want it pushed through. Lol, really? What a joke.

Ok thanks. I have always sent and received btc the same way. Even on dec 18th  I sent 3 btc to another exchange and it took about 20min. So how do I cancel this transfer then and get the btc back in my wallet?

You're retired in two years.

Im at seven days now bro. Still waiting
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:17:54
Lol I paid 266 sats/b and still waiting 8 days later. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:26:20
I voted you up again. Crazy how this community gets so defensive if you just state the facts as they are. Im waiting 7 days now for one btc from my wallet to bittrex. Seven days. This cannot be used as a cryptocurrency the way things are now. Store of value - sure, right now. But usefulness - no. Looking forward to changes in the new year so btc can stay relevant.... And Im sure I'll get downvoted too just because I stated the facts as they are. w/e
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:36:51
Old thread but Im having the same issues. Now researching transaction accelerators. How long until your unconfirmed tx went through? Im at 8 days now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:31:06
Cool thanks for the reply. Is it possible to just cancel the transfer? I never had to do that before
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:33:17
I was worried about lost funds too. Feeling more relaxed though now. Will get it back somehow eventually Im sure - just dont know when lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:37:15
Who cares about the logo - you did well man. Im assuming you're not a graphic designer so dont worry about it lol. A great gift for sure, and one that will continue to only appreciate over time. Merry christmas to you both! :)
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:02:25
Alright, alright, alriiiight
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:20:11
Nah... waiting seven days now for one btc at 226 sat/b. Stuck. I have an option of paying 650 usd for an accelerator so I can get it in 2 to 3 more days but thats pretty fked up.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:59:14
Do you english?
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:20:44
I cant figure out why people suggest splitting the seed up into multiples and storing at different locations. If you lose one piece of the puzzle you lose everything. The only you prevent is someone else getting it all in the event of theft I guess. But you still lose it all in the event of one of the pieces get stolen. Is this the logic?

"Good accounts pass through untouched. Bad ones are suspended and referred to law enforcement authorities if the transaction involves more than $2,000, the patent indicates."
Reported to authorities if the transaction is more than 2k? Wow that can't be serious.
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:42:37
Me too. Banking in se asia.
@_date: 2019-11-11 06:37:17
Exactly. Have a look at past predictions from Mr Lee lol
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:40:34
Sounds like a decent plan to me. You have living allowance, accommodation, meals etc covered. You have a great degree and will get a kick ass job when you return. You can't take all your shit with you to Africa anyway so why not liquidate it all and do with it what you want. You don't need to defend your choices to anyone but yourself. Best of luck in Africa, enjoy your adventure!

Chocolate bitcoin. Everyone likes chocolate. Bullish af right now.

How did that nut taste lol
@_date: 2019-08-24 13:11:11
I always feel like.. somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:30:05
Exactly. This dude has experience
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:52:21
Oh ok, got it. Although I'm not the same age as op's dad, I am from the time when we still had to learn how to write cursive in school lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:15:45
Totally serious here, but are you just a young buck with no experience reading cursive? I know it's not written much anymore these days but could you not read the message?
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:17:42
Damn... 5-6k usd in btc in 2013 would be one hell of a return now.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:23:37
Hahaha... Doesnt work that way noob. Take it from me, I lost everything - and I really mean everything- in the divorce. Divorce lawyers are scum sucking pieces of filth and the women who hire them arw a notch below. Never getting married again. Not worth the emotional or financial suffering.
@_date: 2019-04-10 14:30:30
Dude seriously...your comments clearly show youve never been divorce raped so stop arguing with the guys who have.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:31:50
Tig ol' bitties
@_date: 2018-03-20 05:44:26
And then theres this article... 
I was living in indonesia when I first got started in crypto. Used this very exchange to make my first investment and I still use it occasionally now. I lived in indo for years and theres one thing I can tell ypu about their government: they do whatever tf they want. Whenever. Especially when it comes to foreigners. When I got notice about the indo govnt eyeballing cryptos last year I knew its only a matter of time until they flip the switch. Usually without any notice whatsoever. OP news seems positive, but never count your chickens early. Especially not in indonesia.
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:33:12
Haha great comment here. Thats going back a ways!
@_date: 2018-07-17 04:18:34
Exactly. 1 mil by 2020 is amazing. 100k by 2020? Still pretty damn fantastic. I would be happy with either lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:52:10
Oh yeah OK. Thought he was talking total mc lol.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:21:18
'bout tree fiddy
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:03:29
Mgtow forever now. I went through something similar, gave her everything she asked for, but she still gor 100 percent custody. Never making that mistake again. Not worth it.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:41:47
Obviously any person can deduce from my comment that the whole back story wasnt posted initially so I could only guess as to how the btc was lost. You must be really fun at parties though. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:38:42
What I don't get about this is the market cap being quoted at 1.5 trillion. At last years ath the total mc was over 800 billion. And btc is supposed to 5x from where it was then, but total crypto mc will only double? Hmm...
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:05:25
Damn man sorry to hear it. This is my greatest fear. Can I ask what wallet were you using? Hot wallet or cold storage? 
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:53:04
Sometimes yeah... but I guess this time not at all haha
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:28:43
Very cool. What was the app?
