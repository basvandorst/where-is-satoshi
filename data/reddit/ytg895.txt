many algorithms that have no known quantum based attacks. yet.

That's not true, take for example Ceasar's cipher which is still taught in schools for historical reasons. Being a simple alphabet shift, it has a quite trivial attack, but it's still an encryption. Just an insecure one.

my original point is that these "quantum-resistant" algorithms are not exactly quantum-resistant, just not so many people really tried to break them with quantum computers, partly because quantum computers are not available yet to the public (so most of the people have no idea about quantum programming), partly because these algorithms are not widely used (so most of the people don't even know that they exist).
and they weren't really invented as encryption schemes to be used in the post-quantum world, they just happened to be sitting on the shelf when somebody was looking for encryption schemes which are not hard because of integer factorization and/or discrete logarithm, but because of some other reason.
I'm not saying that these encryptions are necessarily weak against quantum attacks, but the fact that there are no quantum based attacks against them only means that there are no quantum based attacks against them, and nothing more. true quantum-resistant algorithms need mathematical proof that there is no way that that they can be solved faster with a quantum computer.

that's true, sorry


could you please point me to the right direction?
