Impressive analysis, hope it'll proove true...
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:35:55
Sorry but is that a paper from theonion.com ?
Only truism and obvious stuff in there, did not learn anything...

Je suis Bitcoin

Here in Switzerland the Vontobel bank offer new financial tools just to allow traders to short bitcoin because the company's owner hates it...
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:25:11
Sorry to say that bitpico is retarded
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:08:26
Will investigate this, thank you very much for the advice !!
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:46:50
Just you I'm afraid...
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:54:53
But all these miners may have no transaction to process, not a better situation.
The question is : who can wait longer, users unable to transfer funds or miners loosing money with expensive inactive hardware...
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:39:07
Early 2018 is just a bit late, we would have needed it november...
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:55:33
Hope those Rialto (XRL) guys can make something of it and pay me a nice dividend... So that I can buy more BTCs !
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:46:50
This is more likely to succeed in a non deflationary system, deflation only favors the ones who are already rich and don't need to work hard or take risks.
It even makes hard working and taking risks useless for both groups, because it is not required or vain...
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:31:29
Proof that deflationist currency would slow down economy ?
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:31:21
Sure, thks ! Gonna do what's necessary to protect my other coins anyway which means following closely the technical and "political" developments of our chain...
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:04:26
My son (12) and daughter (9) want me to promise that I'll give them one BTC each the day they turn 18, what should I do ?
Don't have many and it will probably be much money for a 18 y.o., afraid they just immediately sell it to buy   dumb things, or that one keeps it to the moon and not the other which means trouble...
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:28:41
You may not care but deflation makes the already riches richer without them doing anything or taking any risk, the poors and middle class relatively poorer without them having much chances to change their conditions, and put in a death spiral every person with even a small debt.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:14:47
Thks all, appreciate it :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:54:20
But how will I be able to sell my S2X If not already on an exchange (chain probably halted) ?
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:23:15
Sure, they'll have chain detection and of course you own your keys...
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:29:57
Interesting, thank you. Anybody's got a refutation on this ? 
So which other cryptocurrencies are in your opinion best suited to become mainstream as a medium of exchange not inhibiting consumption, I guess those with anti-inflationary aspects (ETH, XMR,...) ? 
Don't you think that it will make these currencies a lot less appealing and slow down initial adoption ?
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:32:15
Nope, they just stated that they will just follow the most-worked chain and that their users must simply not transact during the fork period... I'd switch to Electrum mobile.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:07:45
Still not released :( Maybe GreenAddress...
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:12:29
How arrogant these NYA people are, unbelievable !
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:39:23
Tried it last week, worked fine but 6% fees...
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:51:23
FOMO is good though... This thing is going to the moon and is at every moment more likely to go up than down.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:52:41
You must simply transfer (withdraw) your coins to the wallet. First install a wallet which let you own your keys, e.g. Electrum, and you will get an address to which you'll transfer your coins from the exchange. You'll need a multi-coin wallet If you want your ETH in the same place...
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:16:00
This looting is hurting bcash...
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:29:29
Questionable handling of the fork. They just stated that they will just follow the most-worked chain (flip-flop incoming ?) and that their users must simply not transact during the fork period... I'd switch to Electrum mobile (or GreenAddress on IOS).
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:38:32
Seems legit
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:42:16
I think that, as the price raise, it will reinforce the inflationnary trend of fiat...
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:29:51
Exactly, and I have no problem with Wang Chun taking advantage of it. Unfortunately EDA will be gone soon...
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:42:36
You're right, FOMO has been my friend...
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:41:38
To the moon... and beyond!
Where we're going, you'll never need to sell...
(because you'll be able to buy everything you need with BTCs)
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:22:14
Yeah right, got your point (and kids too)... Would say that some FOMO is good but too much is bad ;)
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:02:06
I like their timing... Known position on SEGWIT2X ?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:28:29
Electrum also has a (just a bit less) friendly mobile wallet...
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:51:27
You might consider Electrum as a more secure alternative mobile wallet, you'll own your keys, it's open-source and fork-proof...
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:56:15
Thks !
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:12:20
Just my 2 sats. 
Do your research and If your conclusion is that crypto-currencies are here to stay, you should buy BTC.
Acknowledge the fact that you won't be able to time the market, like everybody except some whales who can influence it.
If you want to buy, it must be because you think it will succeed in the long term. Therefore it is at every time more likely to go up than to go down. Therefore I always buy immediately when I have something to invest. By delaying your tx, you risk much more missing out that you could possibly win...
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:00:49
No no, just wanted to discuss some less positive aspects of deflationary systems... But I personally also enjoy our deflationary BTC which counter-balances others' excesses...
