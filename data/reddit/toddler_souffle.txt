You can’t lose if you don’t sell!

Well it’s definitely safe to assume you know more about this than I do.

From the almost nothing I know about encryption the current status would take longer than the observable universe has been around (assuming brute force). But I don’t know, quantum computing sounds like a buzzword so let’s go with that.

Holy fuck.

And he is cryopreserved. Imagine if he wakes up in a couple hundred years with a shitload of bitcoin hidden in a wallet making him basically a demigod, and a robot body to bypass the ALS. That would be the most cyberpunk thing ever.

Basically I had like 2 weeks about encryption as part of a descrete math course. And when someone says hash table I think of a table made of hashish.

More or less. When you die they embalm you with a solution that doesn’t burst your cell walls when frozen, then they freeze you. You can opt for a full body, or just your head to be preserved. The idea is if the structure of your brain is well preserved neural pathways should be preserved as well, so memories and experiences should persist. If a time in the future where we posses the technology to reboot the brain and cure whatever caused the individuals death then we can revive them and much of their “self” would still be there (which also gets into some interesting philosophy).
I’m not sure if Hal is public about the type of preservation he opted for but given his ALS I suspect he would go for just the head.

I’ve said it before but I think it’s super badass that he’s also cryopreserved, so there’s a nonzero chance that he will be revived in a few decades or centuries and wake up with some insane bitcoin fortune and a new robot body. The most cyberpunk thing ever.
