@_date: 2015-05-24 18:09:59
Awesome! That's a brilliant good move. Financially speaking, you'll come out ahead having made the move you did. Wish I was smart enough to have done that! If by the time you get out and having the coding down to employability, you wouldn't have experienced what I did when it came to making the transition and being underemployed for a bit - letting the loans balloon in interest.
I still love law, and I don't necessarily think everyone should just leave law school or the profession, but the employment landscape for attorneys simply cannot absorb the amount of new lawyers coming out of the schools today (apparently the bar exam isn't barring enough people, I'd say it's literacy and technology that killed the profession - which I find hilarious). I may return in to practice one day, but it can't be in a rank and file capacity, and coding will probably be something I'll still do.
Taking the bar and being admitted will give you quit a bit of credibility when in comes to business, and also politics/policy if you decide to pursue that route, even if you don't practice. Just ignore the haters who can't understand what you're doing.
Ruby is awesome, and they have a great community out there.

I did, actually. Just wanted to share what I wrote.
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:23:35
Very cool! It all really depends on if you strictly want to be a lawyer or more of a software engineer working with bitcoin. Being able to do both will get your foot in the door a lot easier, though in practice, you'll quickly find that you're more productive in one aspect over the other.
It's funny you mention this. In the past year or two, I've actually seen younger lawyers (straight out of law school) make careers out of working in the regulatory space in-house, at Coinbase for example. These people were relative unknowns who started giving talks to groups and became experts by teaching and pontificating. Bitcoin law (like Sports or Entertainment Law) is probably all of the following (by no means exhaustive): Securities Regulation, Tax, Contracts, Property and Business Law. The crazy thing is, the law cannot keep up with bitcoin.
If you are an evening student and you want working in the bitcoin space a very likely scenario after graduation, I would certainly suggest you spend time to learn to code and contribute to your brother's start up while finishing up your JD and being licensed. Attend the bitcoin conferences and get yourself known.
Pick your brother's brain has to how you can help him out. Though Bitcoin core is written in C++, you can contribute to so many awesome projects in the higher level languages that are faster to learn. Best of luck!

*Started with Codecademy just to get my mind in the mindset. I did the HTML, JS, CSS, and Python tracks. I did this in about a month or two.
*I decided on a platform I wanted to work on - iOS.
*I found a great book from the Ray Wenderich called the iOS Apprentice  This guide in my opinion is the best learning tool out there. It walks you through coding 4 apps, line by line, with features like geo-location, working with an API, and a persistent data store. If you end up doing iOS development professionally, you'll likely find yourself consulting to his tutorials time and time again - they just show up in the Google searches.
*As I kept working through the guide, admittedly I still had tons of gaps in my knowledge. Like, what the hell was a pointer? What's the point of subclassing something?! This is normal, and if you stay the course, it'll all come together. This was about month 5 or so.
*I joined meetup groups related to iOS development and learning programming in general, and attended them.
*I worked through Think Python (free),  I think it's probably the best beginner Python book out there. The other one is over 1500 pages long isn't very helpful. At this time, I also flirted with  which as a book on cryptography. What's mind boggling is that part of the book covers the encryption that was considered military grade, and illegal to know just a few decades ago!
*I found and entered a hackathon. Even if you don't feel totally comfortable with your skills yet, if there's one nearby, you should go. They have free food, swag, and people are generally friendly about things. But, by the time you get there, if you can do things like populate a list from an API, or POST or send emails out from the phone, or get the location of the user, you should be in good shape. In the hackathon I entered - it was a local one sponsored by ATT and the theme was social good. I ended up working with a team, and we won first place. It was simply a Pot Hole Reporter/Tracker to the city of Los Angeles. The fact that the app was working counted for quite a bit - something to keep in mind when you have time constraints. To give you an example of the other apps, here is the write up from two years ago. 
*Around this time, I had also put out my first app, that's essentially a toy app. It featured a list view with information of different eateries, and it did a bit of geolocation.
*By now, I have surface level knowledge of Objective-C, its APIs, and superficial knowledge of Python and Javascript. I also had the win from the hackathon, and that app. To test the marketplace, I tried submitting a few resumes out even though I felt I was under qualified. One recruiter liked the fact I was a lawyer, and the rest was history, sort of.
*Being on payroll meant that I now have the time to study programming full time. This was actually where I really got down to the nitty gritty, and when it eventually clicked. Given how aggressive the time line was for me to learn how to code, it's a given that my core learning extended even here to this point of employment. My work knew this to, obviously.
The above is probably a bit of a mess but, that's how I did it in a nut shell. Your learning never stops as a programmer, and that's one of the things I love about software development. Also, there's really no shortcut. You just have to be coding until it clicks by putting in the hours, whether it makes sense or not. Those bootcamp guys come out just as incompetent, but it's implied that they're autodidacts, and would be able to contribute once they start employment, or soon there after. 
TLDR: Codecademy, Ray Wenderlich iOS Apprentice, Hackathon, get an App on the App Store, start applying, 1 year.
Lastly, if anyone is wanting to learn to code (but have no ability), but want to be closer to the action as they're learning job wise, consider becoming a manual QA analyst. You get to work with developers, and you should be able to hone your coding ability to trying automate a few things. Web development shops have these gigs in relative abundance.

@_date: 2015-05-24 18:24:14
Yeah, law school in the early 2000s was a supposed fail safe to the money. US News and World reports can be attributed to helping start the mess of imbuing the thought that all law school graduates who come out of a range of schools will have a then starting salary of $125,000 (now $165,000). Those who come from lower ranking schools weren't far off supposedly. Then law schools also got caught up in gaming the rankings by cooking their employment numbers. 
This system is sort of like the military industrial complex, as there's so much money that's being made by law schools, private and government lenders. There's a reason why outstanding student loan debt is flirting with 1 trillion dollars today here in the United States.
I think it's unconscionable that it got this way.

Thanks for your interest! You're closer than you realize when it comes to the transition, keep that in mind. I think that's a big hurdle lawyers have to over come in regards to leaving the profession for sometime else. If you can pass the bar exam, there's indication that you're a great learner, and you can learn code too.
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:30:36

Yep. QA guy. They're at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to software development. Basically, manual QA people go through the software to test to see if there are bugs, and report back to the developer and stakeholders about them. It's not a glamorous job, but it was a good place for me to have a job as I was learning how to develop.
Here's a job search for example:

Also surprising are the comments on the wsj.com site. There are less haters citing PT Barnum and Tulips, and more showing a genuine interest in the technology.

@_date: 2015-01-19 05:06:29

The more I read through the additional pages, the more I believe this is the case. There's less incentive for the referred to sign up without the $5 bonus, but now there's going to be an increased ubiquity in invites - which will probably work in Coinbase's favor better.
I do notice that they've called out the presence of a cookie when a user returns without a referral - rewarding you as the referrer, so that's cool. We're gonna have to see how this works out in the next couple of months.
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:04:15
This must mean the friend will no longer get the initial $5, is that correct? Is the bonus only for the referrer, and not the referred?

By BRADLEY HOPE And  MICHAEL J. CASEY
April 5, 2015 2:50 p.m. ET
Some of the U.S.’s biggest proprietary traders and investors are testing the waters for a bigger move into bitcoin, giving a potential boost to the fledgling virtual-currency industry.
While still cautious of becoming exposed to “cryptocurrencies,” some of the firms, which trade with their own money on their own behalf, say they see potential for big profits in trading bitcoin as more investors enter the market and financial-services firms use the currency to streamline transactions.
Their involvement could help reduce volatility in the market for bitcoin, which has struggled to gain legitimacy in part because of concerns about wild swings in its price.
Among the companies at the forefront of this move is DRW Holdings LLC, a high-frequency trading firm in Chicago founded by former options-pit trader Donald Wilson in 1992. DRW is a founding investor in a new bitcoin financial-services firm called Digital Asset Holdings that launched last month. Cumberland Mining &amp; Materials LLC, a DRW subsidiary, has “begun to experiment with cryptocurrency trading,” DRW said.
Other firms with large proprietary trading groups also appear to have an appetite for greater exposure to bitcoin.
Citadel Securities LLC in Chicago and KCG Holdings Inc. in Jersey City, N.J., were among a small group of firms that have offered bids to buy shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust since it listed last month on the OTC Markets, a platform typically used for trading shares of smaller companies that aren’t as heavily regulated as stocks listed on exchanges.
The trust holds bitcoin in a fund that issues shares to wealthy investors accredited by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
KCG spokeswoman Sophie Sohn said that in addition to the engagement with the trust, her firm is “actively exploring various opportunities related to” bitcoin. Citadel said it was not involved in Bitcoin apart from the bids offered for the trust, a spokesman said.
Wedbush Securities, another firm that has made offers to buy shares of the trust, saw it as “a good place to get your feet wet” with bitcoin, said Gil Luria, a payment analyst at the Los Angeles-based investment bank.
Launched by an unidentified software coder in January 2009, bitcoin is a digital currency that is created, or “mined,” by computers.
Advocates believe it will transform how people buy and sell goods and transfer money across the globe. But its rise has been plagued by concerns about a lack of security, criminal usage and price volatility. While it is accepted by an estimated 100,000 merchants world-wide, its use by mainstream consumers remains limited.
Investment in bitcoin and related digital currency-based businesses has surged in recent months, in part reflecting bets by venture capitalists and other investors on several noncurrency uses for the technology that underlies bitcoin. Various applications are under development that aim to strip out middlemen from the financial system and enhance record keeping and transparency in the broader economy.
One persistent problem for the bitcoin market is it can be hard to trade because there aren’t enough buyers and sellers at exchanges. Executives at those exchanges have sought to persuade high-frequency trading firms to begin making markets in bitcoin, trading-firm executives said.
In market making, a trading firm offers both bids and offers for an asset so that investors always have a willing party with which to trade. The trading firm tries to capture the spread between the bids and offers, buying at a slightly cheaper price and selling at a slightly higher price.
Ari Rubenstein, co-founder of Global Trading Systems Inc. in New York, said his team is looking at how to trade bitcoin but is waiting for regulators to give a signal that they approve of it.
“No one has an idea if bitcoin is going to take off and be unbelievable, but everyone agrees it has that potential,” he said. “But we are still weighing the risks of getting involved.”
Until now, New York broker-dealer SecondMarket Inc., a pioneer in trading alternative securities such as private-company shares, has been the largest institutional market maker.
The firm, which launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust in 2013, said it has traded almost 800,000 bitcoins valued at more than $300 million since its founding.
While there has been a higher level of interest in bitcoin from institutional investors, including hedge funds and proprietary traders, there are still a number of challenges for the market to overcome before those players can get more heavily involved, said SecondMarket director Michael Moro.
“One is that at a $3.5 billion market cap, it is still a small place for traditional large money institutional guys to make markets,” he said. “Two, liquidity is scattered” across exchanges in Hong Kong, Europe and the U.S.
For firms to get more engaged in trading bitcoin directly on a large scale, it will require more sophisticated exchange infrastructure and regulatory certainty, said Charles Cascarilla, chief executive officer of ItBit Pte. Ltd., a bitcoin exchange.
“They are all very interested, but it comes down to having some kind of regulatory clarity as well as to the technology available—whether you have something they feel is trustworthy, whether you have a big enough capital base, whether you have good enough technology,” he said.
