No. no. no.
Banks collapse not because some fraudulent transactions but because its normal, standard activities. Unfortunately for that to know one has to at least take a glimpse at quarterly report of any bank and have some fundamental knowledge of Fractional Reserve Banking. Every simple man understands that bankers are banksters but not everybody knows exactly why? Answer is simple. Banks are functioning on the assumption that no more that a fraction of deposits, 1% to 5%, can be withdrawn in cash. If more deposits withdrawal are requested banks needs external help or declare bankruptcy. 
The whole Fractional Reserve Banking is a belief system - people believe that they have money whereas that's only true when the said fraction of people does not withdraw deposits from the bank.
European Commission set up a limit of initial capital to start your own commercial bank at 5mln Euro because such capital is supposedly enough to build trust. Well, that's wrong. 
With Fractional Reserve Banking it's not the initial capital that builds trust to bank but Deposit Guarantee Scheme which forces **taxpayers** to guarantee 100k Euro to any deposit holder because regardless of the initial capital current banking system will always allow banks to have fraction of deposits in cash.

After gold standard was abolished in the early 70's the difference between economy and religion vanished as the only connection between money and material world was removed. Money is an idea today. Worse, there is essentially no upper boundary on how many ideas can be created.
So, yes, of course, the economy is rigged towards the few that create ideas :) that's for sure.

No banks don't do money laundering. It's illegal. Instead they do Fractional Reserve Banking. That's legal. Better.
To open your own bank one must have initial capital of 5m Euro. Just for a start.
That single requirement rules out majority of potential competitors.

So if you loose trust to your bank for whatever reason then how do you withdraw you money?

That's how you read it. _controlled currency_ by itself does not even imply which regulations or financial bodies does the _controlled_ bit apply to.

That's exactly what Quantitative Easing is. How much money did FED print just over last few years? I take it's probably a container ship or so.
Funnily enough printed paper is the only connection of money and material world.

_controlled currency_ is not a good choice of words as it suggest that there are currencies whose supplie is not controlled which is not true, just o mention QE. 
There are many ways in which a currency can be controlled, thus lack of control in one particular facet of the currency does not immediatellly make in _uncontrolled currency_.
