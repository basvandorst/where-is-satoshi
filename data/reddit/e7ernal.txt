You seem to be overlooking my point:


Nobody should assume perfect cooperation at any time. In fact we should expect defectors. But, as the relay network proves, cooperation is the 'norm' and deviations are just that, deviations.
The reasons we have to worry about 50% hashrate in pools is because we have to assume that any particular agent can go rogue, be taken over by a hostile government, or simply act stupid. If we had to build for a system where everyone went nuts, 50% wouldn't matter because there's nothing stopping every miner from refusing to include transactions or refusing to build on each other's blocks. If miners want to act like idiots en masse, that's just going to destroy Bitcoin and that's that.
Peter consistently assumes every miner *is* an idiot, rather than every miner *has the capability to be an idiot*. There's a big difference, because if you try to stop the former you'll drive yourself mad and make ludicrous engineering decisions in pursuit of it.

Don't keep Bitcoins with a 3rd party. Remember, if you don't control the private keys, you don't control your Bitcoins.
Consider running Electrum or even a full node. You can also get a hardware wallet if you feel safer with that, like something from Ledger who is on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

8 is already a compromise down from 20, keep that in mind.
I do think that ramping up to 8 rapidly would be fine though, then slowing down to the standard doubling. Just so people can see issues approach more continuously rather than going from 'totally working' to 'totally failed' instantly. I'll admit that I'm not 100% sure how the actual implementation for XT works with regards to that activation, but I do think it's a jump. Maybe if core implemented BIP101 they could tweak it to be a bit less drastic.
But, I do think that the network as a whole would be fine with an immediate transition to 8 MB. It can handle it.
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:49:13
There's a lot of heated rhetoric that flies around, but most of us who run XT are just concerned with the development momentum from Core. If you guys really do get scaling underway, we'll be happy. We're just tired of hearing "just wait for layer 2 solutions that don't even have implementations yet!"

@_date: 2015-06-12 00:38:16
The centralization can occur voluntarily on the edges. People can find ways to bundle transactions, use payment channels, or find other ways to mitigate the mining fees as a percent of transaction value. But that can be done *outside* bitcoin proper. The fees don't go to a central entity that controls your coins. Centralization is voluntary and done on a competitive market basis. That's far and away superior to Paypal in every metric, except stealing your money and saying "haha!"
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:11:11
Seeing as bandwidth of nodes/miners can handle an order of magnitude more than currently is being pushed on them, or more, I don't see a problem with being a little more aggressive than a conservative bandwidth growth estimate.
For instance, my run of the mill residential connection can handle all but that final leap. I don't think it'll be too much of a stretch to push it this hard. If anything, I don't think it's aggressive enough, but it certainly will suffice and not hurt anyone.

Bitcoin is a way of opting out of chargebacks to (in theory) save some dough. Now, if the vendors don't transfer that discount to the consumer, one should not be terribly surprised when nobody wants to use bitcoin there.
The whole point of bitcoin is cutting out the card company middlemen.

I'm surprised you even get that much with DSL.
Cable/fiber are what anyone who wants to actually host a web service should be running, and residential cable for my rural area still goes well over 100/10. I think I get something around 100/15 right now, and that's around 60 a month I think.
My overall point is that there are more than enough people with access to reasonable bandwidth. We shouldn't tailor our solutions to the lowest common denominator, but make them fix the expected ability of the average person who'd actually be interested in contributing to the network.
@_date: 2015-06-17 02:04:55
My point is that a residential connection in a developed country should have no problem meeting even max blocks at over 32x their current block sizes. That's today, and things can and will get better by the time we actually hit that point.
I don't think we have to worry until requirements start moving out of the range of all but a handful of residential networks.

That's just a maximum. It doesn't mean that blocks will actually be that big. Miners can set their own limits. Also, that's 20 years from now. You remember what bandwidths were like 20 years ago? Yah... I think we'll be okay.

Why do we need nodes to be located in countries with bad infrastructure. I'm fully aware most people don't have great access. They also don't find a few hundred bucks for a 3TB HDD pocket change. That doesn't mean they don't get to benefit from the bitcoin network. That just means nodes will operate out of wealthier areas with better internet connectivity, kinda like how web services already do.
It's not a real problem, as there's more than enough decentralization anyways.

If you want Bitcoin to succeed you're going to need both. The thing XT and its devs are pushing is an easy solution that seems necessary and can be done right now.
We can't wait another 3 years for all these solutions to roll out. Bitcoin has to be ready to accept massive influx of users and widespread adoption today.
If these techniques can solve the current crisis and give some headroom for later layer 2 solutions, that's great. But only if they can do it very very soon.
Again, the biggest gripe any of us have with Core and its development path currently is that we've known about this issue since 2013 (and really earlier) and nobody has actually 'done' anything except Hearn, Gavin, and friends. Talk is cheap, action is what counts.
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:51:20
There's conservative and there's stupid. BIP 202 was conservative. Not doing anything and banking on brand new tech that is complex to roll out - that's stupid.

There are plenty of small merchants which I trust just as much, or more, than large merchants. It's a matter of trust, but more people trust those larger merchants than smaller ones (since they have more clients period).
Small local shops, especially those which deal purely in the physical realm, should jump on board bitcoin. I know that convenience stores, restaurants, taco trucks, etc. often get hit hard with credit card fees. They'd do well to move to bitcoin. Not just that, but so few people tip in cash these days because of inconvenience, which means those tips can't be done under the table. Bitcoin would be good for service workers that rely on tips, since it'd be easier to do so under the table.

That sounds awesome. I'm glad people besides myself are thinking about the more complex control with multiple parties that corporate finances would require. I also like the idea of anyone being able to create what is effectively a 'tree of wallets'. With multisig, it's a great way to give people flexibility over inherited assets, while still maintaining control. So, I can hire a contractor and give them a wallet with some BTC in it, and they can do whatever they want with their own finances, but I maintain control over the money (maybe alongside some 3rd party guarantors). It'd be a great way to ensure work was actually done before payment, without complete trust of a 3rd party, and while allowing funds to be spent as needed, rather than large lump sum payments at the start or end of contracts (which are a recipe for unhappy parties).

He wants to work in an organization that does.


If he worked for ISIS and was pro bitcoin would you say the same thing?


I think politicians - those who are responsible for the decisions made - are responsible for it. If not them, then I really don't know who runs the damn thing.


Online 'piracy' seems to do just find ignoring the government. It can do so because it is global and decentralized. So is bitcoin.


That I can agree on.
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:52:56


Fair. I misread.


It means that nobody is above the law. This is obviously fantasy, as we can tell with things like HSBC. Money laundering and supporting terrorism? No problem if you're rich enough!


Each company might work differently. Regardless, at that point I'm calling only to report something, not because I think that the cops will actually get my stuff back or catch the bad guy(s). They're doing the job of estimator at that point.
Conversely, when I had an auto accident recently, the insurance company didn't want a police report and said they'd do their own investigation. So, clearly companies can and do function just fine without police. It's probably a matter of what costs they can offload onto socialized government entities like police.


All I'm saying is that I'd like to be able to support good things like infrastructure without supporting mass murder of children. Is that too much to ask for?

I've thought a lot about this because it's one of the key components of "Assassination Markets." I believe the problem is unsolvable. There are no systems which can align incentives in such a way to get people to participate over other options, while also not being open to gaming.
The only way prediction markets work in the real world is because of the power of real enforceable contracts against singular entities.
Now, I might be wrong, and there might be a solution to the problem. It's certainly worth more investigation, and a mathematical proof that it can't work would also be nice. I think the results are quite powerful either way.

How can government control violence? The only tool it has is violence. Laws are all backed by enforcers, otherwise they're just opinions on paper. The power of the State is the ability to send goons with guns at anyone for any reason they can rationalize on paper.


My point is that government initiates force against peaceful people for the benefit of politicians and their cronies.

The reason that doesn't work very well in the Oracle problem is Oracles can be anonymous and the system is decentralized.
I'm still learning more, but centralized approaches where some nodes have verifiable real identity don't apply in the Bitcoin world.
Openbazaar has to deal with this problem, and even their proposed systems are flawed at the moment, by their own admission. We need some better solutions.

It doesn't work, because as long as the cost of creating false answers is lower than the benefit of creating false answers someone will spam bogus answers in order to swing the outcome of a system.
And if you impose high costs to submitting answers, you risk driving away people with little to gain, thereby destroying the unbiased nature of the decision market (everyone just votes in their own favor and no extra outsiders weigh in).

Thanks. That was really helpful. I wasn't aware of the mechanics of how multisig accounts were evaluated.
The reason I was asking about reusing addresses in multiple multisig accounts is because it opens up some powerful possibilities for corporate/group accounts, among other things. The ability to use the same private key for multiple accounts allows people to mutate the number of account holders and move money around without having to assign everyone a new key each time - they just need the new hashing script, if I'm not mistaken.

It doesn't matter because at the end of the day there is a monopoly on law and its enforcement is not in the digital realm. The problems with government aren't that they write laws, its that they initiate violence on innocent people.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:32:20
That's one interpretation, but I believe a valid interpretation would be that the 'monopoly' spoken of is one of money creation, in which case the Fed fits. I mean, in theory all money is loaned out from the Fed, so it kind of is a central credit issuer, though secondary issuers exist lower on the pyramid.
I do not think it's entirely right or wrong, but it's definitely close enough to give pause.

There are plenty of places that also charge extra for credit card over cash/check. Maybe it's not legal, but they're doing it. And these have been major companies, like my last rental agency, not mom and pop shops.

Then I'd say it sure has a future, since people are continuing to adopt it. You just think it's overpriced or was speculated to increase in price more than it should've. Or, it's underpriced because it's actually being used more, but it's costing less.


People thought that about computers too. This is a slow change, and it will be a generational shift.


And nobody really knows how they work either, but those things have decades of momentum behind them, as well as a lot of guns in the government's case.


Why does that affect what you do with your money? Are you trying to be one of them? Clearly if that happens, holders of bitcoin will be massive beneficiaries.


Why does that matter? Nobody knows how dollars work either, and yet they use them all the time. The issue is not the complexity of bitcoin itself, it's the lack of infrastructure for the regular person. We're getting there - look at bitpay and what they've done in the small business world (and large business!).


Sure, you can try to predict the irrational actions and misvaluations of things, buy them in advance, and sell at the highs. That's what lots of traders do. That is *not* investing. Investing is taking something which has value and putting your money in it for the long run.


Who does? These things take a lot of time.


That's a valid position to take, but you seem to be basing it on really poor factors. You're an emotional 'investor' and it should be no surprise that you're losing money.

I assume you're referring to the wonderful world of quantum fourier transforms? Unfortunately nobody really talks about the problems with those in practice, which are that your frequency resolution is only as good as your time-resolution, which is affected by noise. Real world QFTs will be noise limited, and as such will only be able to give answers within a certain probability of error.
Since we don't know what typical SNRs would be for our measurements on a real quantum computer, we can only theorize about an algorithm, not about an algorithm running on real hardware.
Just as I can imagine a classical computer running at a clock rate of 1 trillion terahertz, I can imagine a quantum computer that runs with no noise. It's so divorced from the practical implementations that it's not worth discussing.

Read it, math is a bit dense at the end there.
What I understand is that in real quantum computers, oversampling is required in order to minimize error.
Since you are mapping a continuous function (the quantum state phasor) to a discrete output, the more possible discrete outputs there are, the greater the probability of error. To me I see a digital signal processing problem, and while all noisy signals greater than the Shannon Limit can be eventually decoded perfectly, you need multiple passes to defeat noisy measurements. See: Turbo Coding.
So, unless I'm wrong, quantum computers have to achieve extremely precise or extremely quick measurements to be of any use in speeding up computation. The physical limitations of our ability to sample the quantum calculation are inevitably the bottleneck in processing speed. I don't see why there is any reason to assume that quantum computers, even if they could be built with substantial numbers of qubits, a wide array of logic gates, etc., would be faster than large numbers of classical computers. The possibility is there, but it requires an assumption about the physical limitations of real hardware.
Basically, since we're in I'd like to reiterate: Quantum computers are not even remotely on the radar for being a problem in our lifetime.

Someone should really port Electrum or Multibit over to function on I2P. Running a full node on I2P isn't for everyone.
If the code to actually make it play nice on I2P is nice and modular, then it shouldn't be too hard to use it as the basis for a patch to every client. I'll take a look at the source code when I get the chance.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:55:36
Electrum is about as easy as it gets as far as software goes. Bitcoin Core shouldn't really be used by non-technical users just because running a full node isn't really an everyman kind of thing, but it isn't too hard to use for anyone who's run any software beyond Word and Excel.

Considering that in theory sharing copyrighted content can yield fines well into the thousands of dollars per incident, and the courts seem to be happy to use whatever semantics make that number as big as possible, I'm going to disagree.
It's just that stopping pirates doesn't score the political points that "getting dangerous drug pushers behind bars cause children" gets. Nevermind that P2P drug transactions help shift the market away from gang-run street sales.
And that is another reason why the risk/reward is actually so greatly skewed in favor of sales over OB. The danger of real violence is quite serious in street transactions. Robbery is common. On top of that, the number of trustworthy sellers is very low, so buyers often get bad product at bad prices. The quality and safety of substances that buyers were able to get on SR were vastly better than anything available from local dealers.
I myself have no interest in being part of that market as buyer or seller, but I think it's beneficial to everyone that the market exists.

'VisaNet handles an average of 150 million transactions every day". 
Assuming that Bitcoin gets 10 million users each doing 1 transaction a day, that's 157ish transactions a second.
So we're not even 10% of Visa and we're already broken.

I think Lightning should be built to handle traffic that bitcoin is not well suited for. That's micropayments. Bitcoin itself just doesn't work really well when you want to move a few satoshis at a time, especially many times a minute.
Unfortunately, the only way it can solve instant confirmation problems is by having very large hubs that have existing channels with lots of people. If I'm walking into a coffee shop that I never visit, the only way I can do a transaction without them trusting 0 conf is by having a payment channel already set up between me and a hub that they too have a payment channel with.
This is just moving Visa to the blockchain, which I don't think is what we were all excited about when we joined the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-08-16 23:05:44


Which is a big concern when the big point of Bitcoin is to let people move money without permission from central authorities.


I was just thinking about how a counterparty-selection mechanism would mitigate some of the problems. Simply set the max fee level and the network will pick randomly from available options (maybe with a blacklist option?)


Some level of centralization is to be expected, but the danger comes when you're forced into centralization.
So, given a situation where vendors all want to use some LN implementation, and they refuse to deal with anyone directly because of regulation or something, then you have huge central payment processors all over again, right?
The protocol, IMO, must enforce some level of decentralization.

BIP 101 is the only BIP that isn't ultra-conservative. In the wake of a wave of adoption, the system has to be able to handle an influx of new users without imploding.
And if it turns out that the limits are too high - well it's easy to soft fork downwards. There are no soft forks upwards.

@_date: 2015-08-18 00:54:41
And those should be done if there's any reason to believe that a code change could affect it.
But, whether or not those things work is an issue of implementation correctness. Nobody has claimed that raising the max block size will break the fundamental functions of bitcoin if done correctly. The arguments against it are that it will centralize the network due to selfish mining and that it will make the network vulnerable to DoS.
Those are things which are more than an integration test. You can't just plug into testnet there.
Honestly, I am rather disappointed with the lack of clear requirements-driven testing from the bitcoin core team. I think there's a lot of talented developers, but being able to write sleek code does not make you a good engineer.
So I guess I'm a bit hypocritical running XT and saying the above. But, nobody is doing the system engineering necessary - neither big blockers or small blockers. And seeing as the network did actually function just fine with much larger max block size before, and we know there's an imminent possibility of running out of capacity for legitimate transactions, I think we should get some solution out there so that if we need it, it'll be ready to roll.
And you know, maybe I'm wrong and everyone is doing great things behind closed doors. I'd love to see that be the case.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:44:31
It's an issue because people learned how they can profit from it - pushing traffic to off-chain solutions that will drive money their way. It's no surprise that people who supported small blocks historically learned how those can be manipulated for their own profit.
The very fact that they're making this into a massive ordeal shows that there's more than simple technical disagreement going on. They're defending something with the fervor of someone who's livelihood is threatened. I guarantee there's money involved, or at least potential money.

@_date: 2015-08-17 04:32:14
I feel like there's got to be a way to tweak LN with some cleverness to make it actually work in a decentralized way. I know the VC guys who fund the devs for blockstream don't give a shit about that, but maybe we can take their starting point and go the last .2 miles so we don't have to run the whole marathon, and we can make something that actually works in a decentralized manner.
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:04:32
It doesn't have to be. That's up to the users. You can run BIP 101 without the other XT stuff if you want.

@_date: 2015-08-17 12:33:31
Actually the real miracle of the testing is that the system, for a small time, actually handled the full rate of spamming. Those transactions flew across the network, but then everything ground to a halt in the mempool as things were waiting to enter blocks.
The network can actually handle a hell of a lot more than we let it.
It also means that in theory it's possible to DoS the network through a blocksize limit.
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:44:58

@_date: 2015-08-16 18:06:13
Honestly, they don't have to do anything. The problems with the block limit will emerge (or bitcoin will have died and it's game over anyways). At that point, people will see the most legitimate solution as XT, and they will switch.

This is where developers need to be smarter economists, and unfortunately that's an orthogonal skill set.
The fee market is not driven by a constraint of the protocol. The fee market is driven by miners themselves. It will happen even if the max block size is infinity.


So, what BIP is your proposal? Simply tossing out a post on Reddit or a mailing list does not a proposal make.


This is *not* a technical issue though. This is actually an issue between the development strategies and risk tolerance of developers, and it's fueled by an obvious concern over conflict of interest.
And this isn't to say that I don't respect the work you guys are doing, but engineering often missing the most important constraint: giving the users what they want in a timely manner. A technically perfect solution is one that never gets used.

No, because XT requires 75% consensus to even fork. At that point, the most secure network is one run with XT's changes, and so it is most likely to be the most legitimate blockchain. Everyone will have to flock to it to stay maximally secure.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:21:54
I think it's more of a concern with a poor implementation of sidechains. I don't think it's an issue with altcoins unless there's a coin that uses the exactly same mining algorithm but with tons of features bitcoin users want but can't get. And we ought not to forget how incredibly powerful network effect is, either.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:40:21
That sounds like half the story to me. My initial gut reaction is that testnet would not remotely capture the economic incentives which people claim are problems with larger blocks anyways.
I don't see any technical reason why the blocksize can't be raised, or even eliminated. People talk about selfish mining, but that's something which you just can't test on testnet, right?
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:40:58


Source on China's hash rate? If it's true, we **absolutely must protect ourselves by increasing block size ASAP**. The Chinese government could seize control of any Chinese mining operation at any point. Bitcoin should not be vulnerable to the whims of any one particular government. In fact, it's strength should come from pitting governments against one another.
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:08:08
That's because the core devs that are holding out are trying to force LN as the primary solution, which they rightfully believe leads to centralization.
They are trying to shape the network to make a profit. It's selfish behavior, which is not surprising, but it's not good for users.
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:23:29

But what if the merchant you want to transact with only has payment channels to the big hubs that don't like you cause you bought weed one time in Colorado and they are scared of the Feds?


But that requires some reputable exit hub. I think that's a big risk factor. I'll admit that it's a cute idea to use TOR-esque routing though.

Sure it is. The network already can handle that just fine and bandwidths are increasing at a rate to more than keep up with that. It's not arbitrary completely. 8MB is what the Chinese said they can handle. The scaling balancing bandwidth growth research with the need for large room in case of quick, heavy adoption.
And the scaling removes the need for future hardforks. Nobody wants to ever have to do this again.
@_date: 2015-08-21 00:36:59


This is not true at all. There is no evidence to suggest that centralization is automatically result of a larger network. In fact, the only thing which could possibly cause centralization is selfish mining, which can happen in ANY size network. It's just easier in a larger network.


How so? That's nonsensical because lightning depends on Bitcoin's security.


No it isn't. Fee markets naturally develop without a block size at all. I have no idea where this stupid meme came from, but fees absolutely do not need to be artificially introduced. Satoshi never thought so. Gavin doesn't think so. I don't think so.


That doesn't remotely follow in any way. You're just stating random claims and pretending it's a chain of logic.


You are so far off base I can only assume you haven't read anything by actual experts in the space.

@_date: 2015-08-17 02:36:29
I think you're mistaken. The incentives in the LN seem to be towards centralization. Larger payment hubs will have more channels open to more people, and as a vendor or buyer, I want to have a pre-existing payment channel link between us so we don't have to trust each other and we don't have to stand around waiting for confirmations.
I don't want to have to open channels with everyone and their mother just to be ensured that I'll get these features - I'll go to the big player with the big network!
So, the LN will leverage the ability to 'solve' the instant confirmation problem, but only by creating a centralized broker between massive numbers of vendors and clients.
It's pretty much just Visa on the blockchain as far as I can tell.
Note that I do think the LN, or a similar concept, is very good for micropayment channels and is quite clever. But, it does not solve the 0 conf problem the way it's going to be marketed.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:47:55
Implying XT was not hard work of core devs?
There are many things which affect scalability. I find it ironic that some devs are willing to entertain brand new crypto as worthy scaling work, while they bicker about the value of a stupid constant that is a leftover hack from the early days of prototyping.
At least Gavin did some simulations and presented real data to back up his ideas. No other developers to my knowledge have done any simulations (correct me if I'm mistaken). At some point you can't just argue.
The great thing about XT is that if the network runs out of room, there's an already existing solution out there that people can pick up. It actually puts pressure off the blocksize debate, because it's finally no longer about "what if the sky falls tomorrow!?"
So now that we have a backup plan, why can't we sit down and do some real engineering work? Lets get some requirements out there  - concrete goals. Lets test implementations to see how they meet those goals. Lets pick the best one, no politics necessary.
Can y'all please act like a development team again, guys?

@_date: 2015-08-16 16:29:25

You don't understand my argument then.
I'm saying that in order to have instant, you must preload your channels with enough money to make the payments. Nobody is going to preload a bunch of random channels, so you pick a channel which has channels with as many recipients as possible. That's the centralization. Hubs will attract more people as they have more people. It's network effect.

Gavin said no such thing at all. You're completely making up a conversation at this point, and that's extremely unprofessional and you should know better.
And of course, you and other "test it more" advocates have to demonstrate how you can possibly test the economic incentives that people say are the primary concern with larger blocks - namely selfish mining.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:30:41
Okay, but what happens when conservative and scared central hubs start eyeing my transactions and stop supporting me when I buy some weed in Colorado cause they don't want the Feds on their nuts?
Don't think it won't happen? Banks already do this to people and businesses.
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:20:13
Well, it relies on a massive assumption that smaller players won't still have sufficiently large connections. I think that worry is relatively unfounded. It's not that hard for businesses to get a dedicated high bandwidth line right now. Hell, even residential connections in much of the first world are looking at well over 100Mbps right now. Compared to the necessary bandwidth to handle today's blocks, I don't see a problem.
I'm not sure about the theoretical nature of the attack. I'd like someone more knowledgeable about the protocol to weigh in on it though. I do think in practice it's not an issue, at least for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:50:23
32 MB max limit for all of Bitcoin wouldn't support even a tiny fraction of any current payment processor. Even if we're pessimistic about adoption, we can't possibly cap that low.
Nobody realizes that if it's this hard to get devs to change consensus code now, it will be astronomically more difficult in the future.

@_date: 2015-08-16 20:58:32
Bitcoin's decentralization comes from it being international. Fortunately, we still have nations that compete against each other, and in sufficient quantity that no one nation could destroy bitcoin without threatening the interests of another. If it comes to it, bitcoin might effectively be in control by governments, but at least those governments have no incentive to cooperate to destroy it.


I think they actually do have a reasonable expectation of future core tech improvements. You underestimate just how incredibly quickly the tech sector moves. And keep in mind, they're only putting in a limit - it's very well possible things like LN and sidechains will take off an enormous amount of pressure (like their proponents claim).
Keep in mind, the block size limit can always be lowered by miners anyways. They're another layer on top of the protocol.


I think people are tired of waiting. You can't have decision paralysis. You guys are suffering from premature optimization and over-engineering. Even if there are potential problems with BIP101, they won't surface for many years, and we can figure out solutions in the meantime. That is not true for sticking with 1MB blocks, *and* there's a very real possibility that BIP101 is sufficient and so doesn't need to be changed at all.


Well, we're already in bad shape then, given the Coinbase complaining about account closings we constantly see here.

And yes, people are just too conservative. They fail to realize that changes *must* occur for Bitcoin to work as Satoshi envisioned. Gavin and Mike aren't stupid and they're trying to make their patch as frictionless as possible. They're good developers who seem to be very cautious about damaging Bitcoin's ecosystem. I have no doubt that some of the other developers are also very good developers, but they seem to be suffer from decision paralysis.
People don't realize how fragile Bitcoin is right now and how easily it could explode to 1000x its size overnight. If you don't build to scale rapidly, then you won't, and that will put a huge damper on cryptocurrency adoption by the masses for a very long time.

Yes, this is a major major major concern, because it automatically not only means that LN transactions have to go through a major company, but that your transactions will actively be monitored.

Silence is damning in this instance.
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:47:54
No. The only argument for that is selfish miners, which is relatively unproven and only might affect *very large* blocks.
Raising the block size to 2MB won't have an impact on miner censorship (which is also something which can be detected and can get those miners in big doo doo).
Smaller blocks on the other hand are 100% guaranteed to cause centralization because the only way to offload traffic is going to be 3rd party offchain solutions.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:29:54
Well then this isn't a new problem at all. It just makes the problem happen by accident rather than require malicious behavior.
Isn't block size limit orthogonal to the real problem then?
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:41:18

But we will.
And to make matters worse, growth is not linear. It can happen in spurts, and it can happen exponentially.

There's some serious risks in underengineering the system at this point.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:06:35
But then your transaction will cost more, as more hubs take a cut (or consequentially, if fees are the same, hubs with fewer channels will make less money per transaction!)
Either way, you have a tendency to centralize.
There's some element missing that provides a disincentive to centralize like that, and I was hoping someone would point it out to me and I could call myself paranoid and walk away happy.

Then why are Chinese miners against increasing the block size too much? That seems odd to me. Either they're dumb, altruistic, or we're wrong.

@_date: 2015-08-17 04:41:34
LN doesn't have a long run incentive to, but it does have a short run incentive. Plus, maybe an out for LN would be to just start using another coin. After all, as long as the coin has the necessary features, there's no reason the system can't really work with any number of coins. So then we get the LN without bitcoin.
I'm paranoid, but you have to be when you're a developer.
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:39:21


If Chinese mining pools truly do own 50% or more of the hashing power, then that's an immense security risk to Bitcoin and effectively places it in the hands of the Chinese government. Anything to stop that would be a very very good thing.
But I don't think you're accurate with your claim. It's unsourced and I've seen evidence to the contrary.

Actually if you read through the thread I posted about the discussion in 2013 (it's a day or two old now, but you should be able to find it), you'll see that the 'compromise' has only led to a slide further and further towards doing nothing. People on the small blocks side have become more and more entrenched while people on the large blocks side have moved to smaller and smaller suggestions. It's now to the point where 8MB is seen as radical, which is why Mike and Gavin decided to dig their heels in and say "enough."
I think it's the right move, because clearly the standard methods of solving the problem (talk about it and hope people just finally agree) have failed.
At worst, it actually causes a real fork and we have a few hours of nail biting while the network switches over.
At best, it causes the devs to agree to something to prevent a fork, finally ending this debate.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:02:29

That doesn't surprise me too much. China is:
* Way more populous than the US. Like 3-4x as many people.
* Experiencing a huge explosion in wealth for capitalists which do not know how to manage large amounts of money, so they blow it all on status symbols they see rich people in the West having. It's like people who win the lottery, they have no idea how to manage that kind of money, so they just buy things like crazy and don't think long term.
I'm sure some Chinese do actually know how to manage their assets, but many do not. They haven't had generations exposed to the downside of capitalism yet, which is that making money is hard and spending it is easy, and it's very easy to burn up your fortunes. You know, the whole generational cycle stuff. We're still on generation 1 there.

I would never want a network to run off altruism. That sounds like a very bad idea. In this we agree wholeheartedly.
But, going back to:


I keep seeing the argument tossed around that large blocks favor large mining collectives due to lower latency, so they get a headstart on mining the next blocks. Isn't this just a variation on the traditional selfish-mining problem?
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:09:41
Yes, and there are lots of clustered applications out there which rely on the 'sharding' principle you describe. There are risks and costs associated with this, but it's not impossible. If each node has a full copy then it's far far far harder to attack the network. The big danger in any sort of sharding approach is it massively increases vulnerability to sibyl attacks.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:45:55
You know, the very thing Bitcoin is supposed to give back to its users?
A central lightning hub can monitor activities, can implement blacklists - it can even tax transactions for governments.
You don't think that'll happen? Well, what do you think the first big players in the lightning network hub will do? Don't you think they'll lobby for regulations like AML/KYC to apply to hubs? Don't you think they'll try to force out competition using governments? That's what every business tries to do these days, because it's so damn effective.
I don't want to give anyone an opportunity to do something like that. The system has to be resilient from the getgo. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:03:59
Well it's unnecessary for users. It's necessary for big companies that want to artificially limit competition. That's what regulation does, remember?


That's what the regulation does - crush the competitive forces.


That's what LN should be used for - microtransactions. Nothing more. At least in its current design from what I'm hearing from people. Maybe I'm wrong in that regard, but I think it's not well suited for other things.


Well, our blathering may shape the implementation of LN, or spur the development of a better competitor. After all, LN is still in its design phase. There's plenty of time to look at potential problems and dodge them. There's enough problems with Bitcoin already, we don't need another flawed layer that will require even more layers to fix, or a nasty debate like this block size one.

This is true, and it's why I'm a proponent of removing the block size limit altogether, and sooner rather than later.
BIP101 is a compromise. That's why I find it so disingenuous when people lambaste it for being a radical re-envisioning of Bitcoin. It's not even radical!
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:45:15


Ultimately, the goal should be that any business that conducts transactions on the blockchain remains able to easily run a full node. They have incentive to do so for added security, and I'd highly recommend it. I don't think BIP101 will make it hard to maintain that goal.


I think LN is really well suited for on-demand confirmations and micropayments unsuited for the blockchain. It's a *GREAT* idea, but people are overselling it. It's well suited for physical vendors or pay-as-you-go streaming and other similar on-demand services. Newegg never needs to use it though, and we shouldn't restrict ourselves to a future where they do.


I think it's a moderate approach that keeps everyone as happy as they can be.

But Nick makes the very argument that if the limit is not conservative enough, you can just soft fork it lower.

@_date: 2015-08-17 22:55:29
You're absolutely dead on with what my analysis concludes. After discussing the issue at length over the weekend and reading the paper on LN, I think that it's a very real concern.
LN is an awesome tool in theory, but it cannot be a replacement for bitcoin. It should only do what Bitcoin does poorly now - microtransactions in large quantities. Think Satoshi Dice. That's what LN does well.
It's fundamentally important that we don't let the blocksize ossify at an unfathomably low number, simply because that forces LN to behave in a way which doesn't threaten the ideological foundation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:52:42

From the docs:


Why would he pick 2Mbit/s? That's a completely unrealistically slow connection. My regular ol' residential internet right now is 100Mbps down/15Mbps up. And I have cows next door.
I don't disagree that large miners might have an advantage over smaller ones if you set it up like he did. Does it describe the real world in a meaningful sense? Not really. Does it say anything about the modest increase to a 8MB max block size? Not really.
Like, I appreciate the sims they're doing, but if you don't make reasonable assumptions about what people's hardware can support, you're simulating something that doesn't correspond to reality, which doesn't give you much information.
What he should have done is swept across differing values for the connection speeds to determine the curve.
But what really needs to be done are proper agent-based simulations that can capture the economic incentives as well. Nobody is doing that.

After recent events, do you believe there is still merit in having a block size limit at all? What we've seen is that the block size limit merely chokes off spam as it would leave the mempool and be written into blocks, but it's already DoS'd the network at that point. The bottleneck isn't early enough to make a difference in terms of protecting the network, and since most of those transactions do eventually get included, it doesn't do much to reduce blockchain bloat either.

@_date: 2015-08-19 01:49:51
This is actually completely fantastic, but these transactions would be massive compared to today, correct? I imagine there's no way small blocks could support any significant number of these transactions.
But, there's one significant hurdle that needs to be overcome here: these transactions are special. That means that anyone gains information simply by looking at which addresses are using these kinds of transactions. Since these transactions are bigger than regular public transactions, I expect a bigger fee might be required to process them. That means, for most cases, people will opt out of obscuring the transaction amounts, and so it leaves only people with 'something to hide' using the obfuscating cryptography.
I'd hope there's some way to encourage either legitimate users (corporations not wanting to broadcast their financial transactions), because otherwise you can just assume "if you're hiding it, you're up to no good".

It's not ideal, but at the same time every system should happily run at capacity. The real issue you outline is one hidden between the lines though: *Full nodes are not rewarded for storage*.


Yes it is. That's why max blocksize was put in place. The whole point of max blocksize was to be an anti-DoS measure, but it fails to even accomplish that. Maybe you should read what Satoshi had in mind when creating it?

The cost of a full node currently is negligible. If you hold even a handful of bitcoins, it's actually worthwhile to run a full node just to provide for the security of your own investment.
There are more than enough people with holdings of 100 BTC or more that have clear incentive to run a full node.
In the future, I do think we'll need to look at full nodes and see if there isn't a way to reward them. Miners should not be the only full nodes - at least I have a gut feeling that bad things could happen if they are.

It's true that XT's patch seems to trade bandwidth for increased chance of transactions making into blocks. At the current max block size bandwidth isn't an issue - we're an order of magnitude or more below what would actually tax the network.
But, it's clear that his solution doesn't scale that well and seems like a temporary 'hack' to fight against what I believe to actually be a perfectly legitimate use of the Bitcoin network.
So, for once, I'm with you - so I'm not upgrading my XT node.
Turns out that Mike being a 'dictator' doesn't actually matter in the world of open source ;)
(also, I don't mine with my node, but it's definitely a problem that the miners can't use the relay network with this patch. Fortunately, miners can afford a shitton more memory for their nodes so it's extremely unlikely they'd ever hit eviction in the first place.)

Second, borrowing is not causing debt worldwide. Borrowing IS debt. They are the same thing.
What's causing massive debt worldwide is artificially low interest rates due to manipulation by central banks (backed by government force). Low interest rates spur borrowing which creates unhealthy amounts of leverage.

Do you? Are you sure? I'm pretty sure the private world has figured out FCC regs mean jack shit, since the FCC mostly exists to protect the telecomm industry, not protect consumers. That's why UL certification exists - cause the FCC does a piss poor job of assuring product quality.


So they prevent abuses of corporations? Then why are the heads of all these agencies corporate lobbyists? Why is the FCC run by a Comcast guy? Why does Monsanto own the Dept of Agriculture? Why does Goldman Sachs seem to be awfully buddy buddy with the SEC?
The purpose of regulatory bodies, whether intended or not, is to protect corporations from competition by creating barriers to entry in the market. They have captured the regulatory agencies. That's why things like the ACA are literally written by the corporations they're supposed to regulate. The corporate lobbyists create the rules, give them to their buddies in the regulatory agencies who then pass them to lawmakers. The lawmakers make up some populist reason why the law must be passed or else you're literally Hitler for opposing it, so it passes with flying colors and they ensure a steady stream of financial and political support from their corporate puppeteers.
The world does not work the way you'd think it does if all you knew came from high school history textbooks.


And it's not about good or evil. It's about what systems are antifragile and what systems aren't. The model of government in the West is not antifragile.

Because of the advent of SPV mining and the prevalence of mobile technology, as well as a poor understanding by businesses of the security implications of not running a full node.


I have trouble believing this has anything to do with block size and far more to do with the mining space becoming closer and closer to perfect competition. Margins are low, and people are looking for risky ways to make a profit. They'd do it no matter what the block size was.


Nobody should care about the average internet user. They should care about the average internet user that might be interested in running a full node. Your grandma isn't going to do it. Bitcoin is a nerdy thing that attracts the kinds of people who have better connectivity and more powerful rigs.
I've shown time and time again to people how incredibly undertaxed my *completely normal* full node setup is.


I just don't even understand what this argument is trying to say.
But, who cares whether the hard limit is a bit aggressive? We're already behind the curve compared to what the network could actually handle. And, we can soft fork lower far more easily than raise the limit.
And we need to think about the big picture: if Bitcoin is going to be a successful money, it has to be able to handle the transactions that a money today can handle. It has to be able to support a large influx of new users that dwarf the current ecosystem. A money is no good if nobody can transact in it.

For the network, it's not ideal, certainly. Unfortunately, how much security can we really gain from a node that's behind a sub-par connection? I don't think you can win when it comes to people having ancient technology for their internet connectivity. Just like there's no way to design roads that work well for horse and buggy, there's no way to design the Bitcoin network to work well for dialup.


Increasing block size is a sign of network maturity and growth, which ought to bring more users, which means higher price per coin. If price isn't going up with adoption, something strange is happening.
And the security gain is going to matter a lot more as velocity increases as well. As more people spend coins more often, businesses which get a few hundred or a few thousand a year in bitcoin sales might leap to millions, and then that marginal cost increase for security isn't so bad, considering what it protects.


Well, count me in. I'm tired of this quibbling. It's really brought out the worst in everyone. Unification behind a real solution would bring the business interests with blockchain-backed applications. They won't come in til they know the network won't choke on their ideas, and I wouldn't want to see that opportunity be missed. It's what I've been waiting years for. I can't be the only one.


There's decentralization and there's peer to peer. I find people always conflate the two, but you can still have significant decentralization without everyone and their mom running a full node. As long as no entity can control the network, we're alright. If that really is such a huge danger, then the mining space is far far far scarier, given how much of the network's security lies in the hands of the PRC. I don't know why people get their panties in a bind over potential security risks when there are blatant, obvious ones present right in front of us today. It's nonsensical.

It costs me less to run my node than I make back in % I contribute to network stability in my btc holdings.
e.g. If I contribute 1 of 1000 nodes out there, then I have 0.1% contribution to stability of the network. If my BTC holdings are even 1 BTC, it means about $0.30 of my own money is being secured by my own actions. Looking at modern hard drive prices, for anyone who owns any reasonable amount of BTC, running a full node is actually profitable. Network bandwidth isn't a factor since either you have it or you don't, but using it costs nothing (in most places).
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:02:55
Exactly. There are developers right now who think that if we increased the maximum block size we'd see the network fall apart overnight, even if we merely doubled it tomorrow. Doesn't that seem wonky to you?

So you can't, but you can insult people. Cool, good to know!


You could dispel the 'proof' very easily by showing me the thread I asked for.
As for declining node count, I addressed that.


But a full node isn't a public good in its entirety. Full nodes provide 100% trustworthy security for an individual or business.


Sure, you could *attempt* it... It'd be completely pointless and would fail.

Okay show me the -1 threads.


Which is a major linchpin of the "large blocksize destroys everything" crowd. They insist that node count will go down as the network grows, but their argument is shaky and tainted by adoption of mobile tech + SPV.


The cost is negligible if you hold or transact in any serious amount of BTC. That cost *will* increase, but so will the number of merchants that want a full node for security. Not to mention that if the network becomes more popular, price of BTC will ensure that adopters will be able to easily upgrade their hardware given the gains they'll have made.


That doesn't even make sense. They can't regulate the cost of running a full node without destroying the internet backbone.

Well, the only thing keeping Bitcoin alive as the leader in cryptocurrencies is infrastructure and first-to-market advantage.
It's pretty easy for the infrastructure to switch over to another cryptocurrency, or users to just do crypto-to-crypto with bitcoin exchanges as a gateway. Then, there's very little to keep traffic in Bitcoin. People will just start moving to another blockchain that doesn't impose artificial restrictions on its users.
Decentralization is key because of 1 thing: security - the ability of the network to resist attacks and not cheat the users. If you can't actually produce meaningful numbers with how powerful or likely attacks are to succeed with various metrics of decentralization, there's no engineering that can be done. Everything has a cost. Everything has a tradeoff.
Talk is cheap. Give me numbers.

The difference is that older blockchain entries are more secure, because it takes more work to redo those transactions after it which stack up.
Traditional ledgers are less secure as time goes on, because there are fewer people around to catch intentional mistakes, corruption of data, or simply to care to keep up records that nobody has accessed for a long time. At best, they maintain constant security. Over a long enough time, I'd wager any centralized ledger will fail somewhere.

You're implicitly making the argument that blocksize vs centralization is a linear direct relationship. Nowhere has that been proven, and I'd argue that it clearly is not.


Dude. Lol.
Who the hell would mine with a node sitting behind a DSL connection? Just put your node in the cloud for $5/month and point your miners at that if you want. In reality, we've heard time and time again *from real miners* that bandwidth is a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny cost of their overall business expenses. Mining centralization is ruled by electricity, period.


But they gain security from having the full node in their control.


If you want to start the doublings at 2 MB instead of 8, I think people at this point would accept that. That's a pretty minor change and it still points us on the right trajectory.
The problem with every other proposal is that they're way way way too conservative. We need to plan for success, because otherwise we're just admitting failure from the getgo. That's stupid, bordering on self-mutilating.

But if you make an unknown communication with a whole bunch of people publicly...
This isn't like a phone call. It's more akin to shouting in a crowded room in a language only you and your intended recipient can understand. Nobody can discern who is talking to who in that situation.


That only matters if communications are delivered instantly. I don't know how the protocol works entirely, but if there's any sort of delay between send and receive then simply correlating times when IPs show up means nothing.


At best they can figure out that you're in communication with someone, which doesn't prove anything about the nature of the communication. At best it justifies a warrant for real searching, but even that is tenuous.

But yes, you're technically correct, which is the best kind of correct. If the government knows you have a wallet and they ban mixing, then yes, directly mixing from that wallet will be illegal.
Fortunately, there's no reason you can't simply transfer all the coins from your wallet to another wallet, and that wallet mixes the coins. If they don't know who owns the second wallet, then all you have to do is say "my coins were stolen" or similar. They'll see a transfer to an anonymous wallet and that's that.

In a society as big as ours, I think the second one might be more true than the first. There's so many people out there in the world that you could easily go a lifetime without ever having to deal with someone twice.
I'm kind of hoping that the internet will offer a solution to this problem in some way. But I haven't heard anyone tell me this solution yet.
That's where markets come in. Reputation markets already exist to handle these sorts of information problems. Take Ebay for example. I can look up the rating of a seller based upon the experiences of buyers, none of whom I know, and none of whom I will ever directly deal with.
While Ebay is not a perfect example (there are plenty of flaws) it is proof that the market can work towards solving the information problem. The demand for better quality information about individuals and their reputations shall always spur innovation in this regard. It's up to us, as individuals, to come up with new and more effective services.
The government, right now, is the primary source of reputation. Remember how we have things like "criminal records?" Notice how a felony confers certain things about a person. We assume that if they are a felon, they aren't to be trusted with, say, a rented apartment, or a job at a certain firm.
However, do you think that a felony for selling some plants is equivalent to a felony for beating a women senseless then taking her wallet? Because governments conflate nonviolent crimes with violent crimes, they destroy meaningful information about reputations. They are a very inefficient and destructive system of reputation networking.


Sure, but what is government than the consolidation of power into the hands of a few? You clearly can't solve the issue of asymmetry of power by creating an all powerful entity. Technology has always been the aid of the weak. The invention of the firearm is one of the most equalizing forces in all of human history, and it made possible the French and American revolutions, because a poor farmer with a rifle is just as deadly as a British soldier, training aside. It turns out that there's a hell of a lot more of the former than the latter.


Legitimacy is really a mental attitude. I don't see much of a distinction between the two cases. What my objections to the legitimate claims of government are is that they are not consistent with its laws or behavior. You cannot make a case for why government is legitimate and not legitimize other, illegal, activities and organizations. Ergo, it really falls to "we're legitimate cause we have the most guns." I don't think people can accept that as a fair case for legitimacy, and therefore by exposing that truth, I show people that the government is not legitimate by their standards.
Does that make sense to you?

Chives sees Bob's piece and is impressed, but doesn't buy it. Chives does see my piece and is instantly shocked and amazed. For whatever reason, my technically inferior art has sparked an emotional collection in the crochet lover. He offers me several million dollars for the piece.
You might say that "this is totally contrived!" yet there are pieces such as the ones by  .
So what gives? We both just decided that Bob's labor is way more valuable. How come my piece is fetching money from Chives and his isn't?

No I'm not.


You imply that the government follows its own rules. It hasn't done that since day 1.


Everything is illegal if an agent of the State deems it so. There's always a law that applies. Hell, they'll just go after you for something made up, and when you prove it was bullshit, you're still crippled. Or worse, you resist and they just arrest you for putting up a fight, even if you're in the right.


The fees don't matter. It's the registration that matters. It's no different than a registry for gun owners. That's how Canada implemented its gun bans. That's how every ban starts. You can't ban what you don't know about. Bitcoins probably won't be banned, but you can bet that the exchanges will only get more and more controlled, and operating outside of sanctioned exchanges will get you tossed in the slammer.
Call me a cynic, but I'd rather be cautious.

In my understanding, all you can prove is that you received BTC from a particular address to and address you have the private key to. Beyond that it's near impossible to know who owns what address, especially if a mixing service is used.
So, any story which is unfalsifiable as to why you got those BTC is beyond the scope of the snooping feds, or anyone else. Just gotta pick the right story if you get audited. It's up to the individual if he thinks he can pull it off.
Of course, you've done well to illustrate the problem with BTC, which is the exchanges are forced at gunpoint to snoop on behalf of the government. Until we get around this hurdle, bitcoin will not realize its full potential.
Or you can always just stay in BTC and purchase stuff in the BTC economy. Not the best move when you want to realize gains in a bubble.

Maybe life isn't worth living without art? Maybe I want to die because my life sucks so much. Economically, there is no such thing as 'need'. It always begs the question. Need to do what? Then you can think up examples that contradict that. It only takes one counterexample to prove a statement false.
You're really trying to make the argument from "need" which is based upon presuming some values are always better than others. There are no such values. Even life is not preferable to other things for some people. Why else would people voluntarily lead themselves on suicide missions in the military? Why else do people choose euthanasia?
You have to let go of the idea of need.

Anarcho-capitalism is a specific organization of institutions, where people purchase/recieve services regarding security, law, and dispute resolution via the market. States do not follow contracts and are therefore not market institutions. You do not sign a contract when you move to another State. It is not a business arrangement. It is not a purchase.

Of course not. You still have to respect the wishes of other human beings. If you ignore what others request that you do, you're liable to lose reputation, and without reputation, you won't be able to reap the benefits of the market. You won't be able to buy anything, get a job, rent, etc. because nobody will trust you.
If you want to live off the grid, then sure, you can ignore social rules and common courtesy. That's your choice. But if you want to participate in the good parts of society, the free market and voluntary exchange, you need to compromise.
The reason you buy security is not to limit yourself, but to protect yourself from people who think they can get away with the above. But, unlike government 'services', a voluntary security force will actually work to prevent crimes, protect your person, and not simply extract rent for the privilege of existing.


A contract is binding if an independent, mutually agreed upon arbiter decides that it is binding, and if reputation agencies agree that it is. It comes down to the market. If you and I make a contract, and we think it is binding and important, but nobody else recognizes it as such, then it doesn't matter that we have a contract.
Fortunately, common law gives us a very large amount of starting ground to work with. Contract law in the West is already very well defined and the principles are derived from common law centuries ago. The only difference is that nowadays, you don't get to pick your arbiter, and so rulings will always be biased. In ancapistan, being able to choose your arbiter means being able to avoid bias. Personally, I think this will severely hamper large corporations and empower individuals, since government courts usually bias against individuals in favor of politically connected interests, especially government interests.


Ancap theory does not mean "no rule of law." Actually, I'd argue that we have no rule of law now. After all, when we have things like the Patriot Act, which clearly violates the constitution - when Boston turns into martial law just in search of 2 lightly armed thugs, and people have their doors broken down by goons with tanks and m16s - when police can arrest you simply because they "smelled pot," no evidence required - do you really think we have rule of law? I think we have rule of what these sociopaths can get away with. It's the rule of appealing to the masses, and as long as they're happy, law won't protect anyone.

All they know is that he bought BTC at some point in the past (and given the price, it might not have even exceeded that $10k report to Feds level). They have no idea which BTC he bought, which he sold, and what the gains were on them. You can't tax the gains if you don't know what the gains are. You also can't trace individual BTC transactions to the point of currency exchange very easily (or at all if they were mixed).
So no, I'm pretty sure he can say whatever he wants and they have no way of proving it wrong.

No, it's the concept of government. It's the idea that rules should be made by politicians and forced upon everyone else. The entire idea of top-down, monopolistic enforcement is flawed, because it is top-down and monopolistic.

Not paying taxes is as righteous as not paying a mugger. I don't think any morality can be assigned because there's a gun pointed to the head of everyone. However, I'd never tell someone who got out of being mugged that he shouldn't have done that. I'd appreciate it if you, and everyone else, wouldn't demonize people who stand up for their rights to their own property.

Regulations are written by large corporations, handed to the regulating agencies and congress, and passed without the bureaucrats or politicians even knowing what they do.
The purpose of regulations is to create a barrier to entry, increasing the cost of competition. It also creates a network of byzantine rules which require massive time/money to comply with. Lastly, it gives government the power to have some loose and ill-defined statute to invoke should they ever want to go after someone they don't like.
You are correct that there is an incentive for the best talent to avoid taking risks in an unstable market, though. I do think MtGox and other exchanges are pretty unimpressive with the quality of their products.
