They definitely work with Macs (via chrome).

Is there an alternative to a wire transfer for large amounts? Gemini has a limit of 10000 for ACH transfers (US only?), I believe. So, if not wire, how would you move it?

Nice find! Lowered my blood pressure a point or two. :-)

Yeah, I didn't go for precision. Just wanted a rough sense. I'd go with 4.0 to 4.9, but it's your call.

... S..S..Satoshi?

Is that the metric Bajillion, or imperial?

Seriously? Ouch. Can you say more about how they got through the lastpass 2FA?

Do I need to bold "anonymous"?

I don't know if it's the cause of the price swings, but this sort of news is great because it brings a lot of validity to bitcoin.  Now, when people google it, they don't just see Mt. Gox and "dark web" and FBI involvement. They will see bonafide financial instruments based on bitcoin, and that is *huge*. 
Financial media having a thing that they understand and can point to and talk about is awesome. We(*) don't want these guys talking about private keys and distributed ledgers. That just makes gramma change the channel.
We want mainstream folks to feel comfortable with bitcoin and not just associate it with scams, theft, crime, drugs, and expensive mistakes. We want it to be approachable. The more mainstream it is, the more valuable it is, the less scary it is, and the less likely it is to be stomped on by our reactionary government officials.
(*) We = [me, my dog].

There is, you know, still room on the boat. Lots, actually. Just get some of the cheaper seats.

Ah, right. It would make sense to keep them off the main chain.
Nice. Thanks!

So, what are the implications on transaction fees if the high-frequency / high-volume traders want to get involved?  If they make money by being first (on a market change in either direction), and make many many trades, does that mean that they're going to completely f**k up fees for everyone else who wants a reasonably timely verification?

Well, you know how it goes. Monday morning. You get up. Eat breakfast. Get dressed. Walk outside to the park. Take your pants off. Take out your phone. Take off your underwear. Open your trading app. Spread your legs. Wait for a breeze. Sell your bitcoins.
The usual.
