Health insurance covers the cost of surgeries necessitated by Reddit bets?

You are incredibly naive if you think that:
1. Holding a PhD makes you more knowledgeable about economics than those who control federal banks
2. Being smart is enough to overcome the enormous amount of influence that these people hold
3. Any significant amount of basement traders actually hold PhD's in a field relevant to economics.
I'd hold off on underestimating them to that extent, it comes off incredibly cultish and ignorant.

What? I used the correct form.

It's hilarious that you actually think that you're smarter than those who are practically in charge of the national economy.

Then you're misreading the thread as well. It doesn't make any sense that he'd be disagreeing with me in his first comment while also saying the Wall Street guys are smarter than the basement traders, unless he flubbed the sentence entirely.

Then you need to work on your reading comprehension and your writing. The only two groups of people that were mentioned in the original comment were:
The "dumbed down fools" which is directly referring to the "Wall Street guys," and the "crypto basement traders" who are apparently "eating [the Wall Street guys] alive," according to the comment I first replied to.
My comment stated that the commenter was naive if he thought that the crypto basement traders were smarter than the Wall Street guys, to which you replied that I would have been right a few years ago, but now "they are all phds and shit," meaning that my statement was currently wrong. By that logic (saying that I'm wrong about Wall Street guys being smarter), you are saying that the crypto basement traders are smarter than the Wall Street guys because they "are all phds and shit."
Go reread the thread, you're obviously confused. Also for fuck's sake man, proofread your shit.

If I'm the one misreading feel free to correct me and show me how this makes sense, I'm pretty confused.

I agree, it is sad. If you believe that the majority of middle aged+ people in our country aren't naive then I'd like whatever drug you're on. You should've invested in an education, I guess. What a delusion you must live in.

That in itself is one of the most naive statements I've ever heard.
