[This is the community](
As for standards of admission, there isn't anything official. I'm not here to gatekeep. But Skeptics in general are people who value critical thinking and who try to have beliefs based on quality scientific evidence.

Everyone is the Skeptic community will tell you the same thing I am. The way you rail against good, quality evidence as to why conspiracy theorists believe the things they do only punctuates that you and those like you are indeed not skeptics at all.

Yes, the article describes those people and their beliefs... It feels like your just being obstinate there. But then again, seeing as you were banned from you don't really need me to tell you about the community, as you're already aware of it. It seems like you just have beef with the community, more than anything. 
And yes, I do disagree with conspiracy theorists about their conclusions most of the time, because the evidence disagrees with them most of the time.

Conspiracy theorists are not Skeptics.

The article describes the movement, I'm not sure what you're issue is with that. But if you want,  you can head to as well.  Or visit [The Skeptic Society]( which is a large organization, though it doesn't represent all skeptics. There are a number of podcasts I can refer you to, if you're like. 
I can determine who doesn't "belong" by several indicators, such as not valuing critical thinking skills, dismissal of evidence that doesn't fit their narrative, etc.  
But no. [This article will help explain better than I can](
