you can't calculate your expenses and revenues clearly and it definetly results in bankruptcy.

I am from turkey and stop believing this, if you have an idea like the title. People here just greedy and tried to be rich and since they bought at 20k, they failed miserably and hate bitcoin right now , which is hilarious. Also, turkish people buy dollar and gold, not some volatile codes.

Health of currencies cannot be determined just by looking how much value they lost against gold.  the important thing is how strong is the health of the country and its economy which is supporting the currency, gold may be 2k next year but you should look how purchasing power is changing through years. If you will be able to buy same thing with same money at 2020 or future then the gold price doesnt imply a failure of a currency. Gold supply/demand can change and also usd ( dxy ) index could change. Gold is increasing because of trade war since trump is acting so aggressive and it could harm the economies. Gold price shows the risk perception in general, not currency health.

Would you guys stop bullshitting ? Its because usd index lost value and since gold priced by usd, its value increased so not because every currency destryoyed. Moreover, it doesnt have to be a bad thing to lose currency value and if one of you take a simple macroeconomy or international finance class you could understand that.
Extra edit: gold was 1900usd in 2013~ and now 1330usd ,so according to this shitty claim, all currencies are going very well.

Leveraged bitcoin trade is one of the most retarded thing i have ever seen in finance.

Username checks but imagine people who actually agrees with this.

Funnier thing is someone said buffet is the luckiest gambler. r/Bitcoin is the far most retarded sub i have seen. Nobody has a clue about how economy or finance works and just upvoting eachother to justify their bullshits.

Exactly. Probably your comment will be downvoted since people in this sub just cant stand to hear negative comments.   
This is the first time bitcoin is really popular among all people and burst. this is why this is most terrible crash.  
Also, 100% right about price stability. nice comment.

yeah pretend like most people didn't bought at over 10k and last 1 year didnt happened, so realistic.

Nice job however i wouldnt push people like that. More than 5-10% of portfolio is too much for bitcoin.
