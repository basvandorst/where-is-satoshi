I thought it could have been as easy as just buying btc and hodling for an year

nice user name  :/
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:15:44
fuck my dreams
where are all those guys who said bitcoin would be hitting  50k or 100k dollars  
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:50:33
tbh  I doubt the crypto bubble will go on for that long and that is why I asked  estimates for an year
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:31:39
Even I have my life savings held  hostage on bitgrail  , I will have no option other than suicide  if they  try  some sort of exit scam  [I am not looking for reminders  on rules of crypto  as I am very well aware of those and I know I have broken them]
The thing is most active traders have their holdings on  an exchange where they can easily  place trades  , there is no two ways about it
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:28:44
Which hardware wallet  costs  50$ ? I only know of ledger and trezor and both of them cost way above  225$   
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:08:56


name some?
and how do they earn if they  are charging zero fees?
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:47:43
so btc will only  rise  by  around  30-40% from the current  price in this entire  year
either you are delusional or may be you are trolling 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:23:44
guys do you think it is still possible  to10X my investment in terms of fiat  within an year if I bought bitcoins at  ath of  19k   :( 
or atleast  5x?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:20:13
you got to take  risks  if you wanna be  a millionaire , i personally have taken loans  to invest in cryptos [bought when btc was at 18k]  and think of  buying  some more if I get more loan from the banks  
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:42:40
yes that is a  good idea and this I sure will do  
but sometimes  I start feeling greedy and think of trying to arbitrage [which at most times is only one way]  and ending up with all my everything on a single exchange  
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:29:48
I only visit  a few exchanges like kucoin , binance  .
Can I install some kind of anti phising extension on my chrome that can prevent  me from getting hacked 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:10:30
that's me honestly ? how do you guys do your research then  ?  
I browse  reddit ,4chan/biz and twitter and a few telegram groups
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:27:55
I am seriously  serious 
How much  do you think bitcoin can rise  in the year 2018
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:19:02
I got into bitcoin only a few  days ago and learnt that leading professionals in the fields like nick , hal etc. had a  active part in its development.  Also bitcoin was so thoroughly tested , they actually found  a bug in the SSL protocol .  This makes me feel bitcoin is actually strong , well built and has faced the challenge of time.
On the other hand  , even though most coins claim to ahave academics from MIT in their team  , I doubt most of them would fail if scrutinized as heavily as btc.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:49:02
wish I had  money to buy more  in this fire saleeeeeeeeeeeee
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:29:57
you are just like me , even I took a loan and invested  in btc when it was  at its  ath
hope things get better till the end of this year  :(
my good wishes are with you
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:54:05
I don't know what  a u2a  is  and i can't find anything  when I googled  about it
can you share a link 
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:44:02
wow it is 25$only  '
but I am still not sure of these hardware wallets because I have never  used one
what if I break or lose it ? what if I drop in water or what if it gets stolen  ?  
let me research a little bit about it  
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:59:43


but  anything fancy is  getting mooned  instantly  and this makes me jealous when I see others easily  10X their money

I can't mortgage my house as it is registered on my father's name and he won't allow this  
tried for a loan but fuckers refused it because I don't have any credit history
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:01:13
and I guess the wins [ and losses] in such trades  are much bigger than the ones in standard trading, right ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:48:24
hold your btc in a private key and do otc trades or with someone on localbitcoin in cash  and don't pay a fucking single penny in tax  
for trading have multiple accounts set over exchanges that don't require any kyc and support  all kind of pairs 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:17:02
I invested in crypto currencies for the first time and tried my hands at a day trading 
 I made  money in the first two trades  that I made[sold when the prices increased , bought more when they decreased ]  in the previous two days
but  now when I sold  the prices have just increased  and increased  , guess I have learnt  my lesson
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:03:01
I couldn't understand a word of what you said
can  you give me an eli5 version of what you said 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:55:03
my mentor said  whatever happens bitcoin is still the king  and keep my portfolio with 90%  btc  and only 10% bch  
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:55:55
and what happened after that  ? I sold all my btc:(
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:42:53
I bought  a few bits when bitcoin was around 17500
It has dropped much and I am already freaking out
Some people are telling bitcoin is going  to end, I am scared to death 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:49
guys who do you keep your calm in these turbulent situations  ?  I am already shitting my pants  
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:27:50
how is bitmex different from other exchanges ?  I tried using it but it seems way to futuristic when compared to other exchanges like binance lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:57
How did you know that? I bought my first btc a few weeks ago
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:15
I hope you are correct  but I am shit scared
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:51:15
all in brahh
even though market is crashin right now  I am not in much of a loss because I double my btc amount in just three days thanks to the altcoin rally   
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:46:33
moral of the story is no matter what never brag
no one likes to stay around some around asshole who keeps bragging about how exceptional he is

Some people like to enjoy themselves on holiday  , I like to enjoy in the markets 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:01:50
my friends took a loan to go on holidays  , others took a loan to buy an iphone  
I am mostly a miser  but I don't think anything is wrong with taking  a loan to buy some btcs  
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:37:45


every other person here is a piece of shit shilling the coin that he has stakes in
do your own research and never trust anyone on the internet 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:39:22
good advice
it sucks here in India as well because the prices are controled by a few handful of exchanges  who have marked  up prices higher than the international rates
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:32:19
no one knows what is going to happen 
but  some spikes  / drops are for a temporary time because of a temporary news that might not affect bitcoin's trajectory in the long term  
some are not and are an entirely differentcase
I have been keeping track of bitcoin since the price was  800$  , would spend lots of time on bitcointalk , this subreddit and other forums but never had the courage to put real money into
lost the track from a few months and have no idea what the price drive up is for  so I was looking for someone who knows better than me andcan inform about the same
I do know that this sounds like a stupid question though 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:22:48
exactly  I will put  90% of my funds in btc  and  10% in eth
I have a few alts like golem , bat , monero , neo / ans , lsk , ltc in my mind but I am not very sure about them right now 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:00:37
should I buy right now or wait  for a correction  ?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:16:37
I am serious man  
I am not very well aware of the reason of the sudden spike in the price
is there a near correction on the way or just go all in right now?  
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:59:44
is it the right time to get in or wait  for a correction?
don't give me stupid answers like every time is good enough to buy   
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:40:12
this is exactly what has happened
I used to keep a track of bitcoin and other  alts  since bitcoin was 800$ and  every dip felt like this is the end
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:00:33
should I buy right now or wait  for a correction  ?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:12:17
exactly  I have keeping an eye on bitcoin since it was around  800$  
fork was about to happen , then this china thing  and many other thnigs  
price dropped many times  but I  never invested  
my friends have invested in btc but don't know much about it  , I waste time on bitcoin talk , r/bitcoin and a lot of other places and haven't even invested a  single penny  
Now I am sureI amgoing to invest  no matter
I am going to put a good chunk of my saving and thus asking if a correction in the near future is predicted or may be just go all in right now  
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:44:49
People with billions invested will make sure this never happens 
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:39:10
But what's wrong with those ? Bitcoin mining  does  consume  lots of electricity  , everyone of us knows that.
@_date: 2018-03-05 06:05:02
yes  man  , I am a pushover and find it impossible to ask for money that I have lent to others 
still I couldn't refuse someone when he asks for money even though I know I won't be seeing that money back again
have lost more money by giving  out to friends  than gambling on megadice :(
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:34:54
Hi I have read this on reddit for a long time that many people are keeping a close eye on the genesis block and if satoshi tries to move/sell even a single one from those bitcoin will be over. Do you have any explanation for this reasoning?
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:38:35
I am pro bitcoin but why should I compare the energy consumption to the entire internet and just not companies like visa/mastercard  ??  This doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:55:55
Can you eli5 what's written there

Miners running a billion dollar  business are smarter than you think them to be
Most of the miners never transacted on one of these exchanges and were  mostly otc trades for cash
and miners can still sell their hash power  for usd or any other currency which is still a legit  business
or may be set up a legit business account in some other country
