What's the good reason? Sounds like somebody's jealous...
@_date: 2014-10-19 20:01:48
If somebody really knows what's going on, what makes you think they're going to be honest?
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:59:43
Valid point. None of this should be censored.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:25:26
Been using bitcoins for about a year now, never used an exchange.
@_date: 2014-07-14 21:26:55
So you don't pay taxes?
@_date: 2014-10-19 20:20:53
There's nothing to trust in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:05:54
There really isn't
@_date: 2014-04-13 23:46:22
Yeah, heat pumps are for moving heat, not heating.
@_date: 2014-10-19 20:20:09
You're right, you should blindly trust people with your money.
@_date: 2014-07-03 23:09:42
Really? Wells Fargo endorsing bitcoin was your first thought? You must be new.
@_date: 2014-01-08 05:52:30
Play bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:18:39
Laws don't matter anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:50:12
That's not a story, it's an advertisement 
@_date: 2013-10-05 01:19:30
Tell us more, whats it take to set that up?
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:03:03
Great! Those would be failed business expenses and you should be able to write them off.
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:59:37
I don't think you realize how big of a group of people you're calling fags, this includes all small businesses you may shop at as well.
@_date: 2013-05-25 03:09:53
I suppose you could call me a corner entrepreneur.
I don't think the sort of trust that MasterCard/Visa have wouldn't be able form in a truly free market. All the regulations make it too difficult a field to get into, preventing competition. 
You're mostly right, but Bitcoin does have one advantage. Credit cards currently serve two purposes. They make money easy to send and the customer doesn't have to trust the merchant because they can always do a chargeback. With bitcoin, we can send money easily, but the customer has to trust the merchant. Bitcoins will save trusted vendors tons of money. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 23:24:32
Getting that out of the contract is another one of the lawsuits goals.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:44:44
I'm getting tired if hearing from Krugman about bitcoin. His opinion is irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:43:11
It's a currency, it's not supposed to create wealth. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:40:29
A merchant is anyone that sells anything, and accepts CCs as payment. Are you saying you don't care about any merchant?
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:26:18
I think they could work together well. Bitcoin could be used for larger purchases or and litecoin for smaller, everyday stuff.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:03:30
I kinda am, but I can even admit that he was right, Beyonce's video was probably better, but that put forth the effort to actually walk onto the stage and take the mic? Damn.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:33:34
Time to pump!
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:53:07
don't use this
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:50:30
Doesn't matter. What he did was incredibly rude.
@_date: 2013-05-04 17:43:04
Maybe litecoins?
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:37:05
Retailers could do the same thing with cash already
@_date: 2013-05-20 19:38:29
Why do you need bitcoins? Fiat works just fine
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:41:24
If you buy something from me, I'll give you a great discount if you pay with cash.
@_date: 2013-06-04 22:58:09
How are they able to enforce this?
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:33:25
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:16:51
It takes a lot to admit something is better than your own product. These guys are great. Does any know what they'll be doing next? I want to spend money with them.
@_date: 2013-06-06 01:40:40
I know, it's great right?
@_date: 2013-06-07 00:50:03
What about people with naturally slow reaction times? Should we have a test for that too?
@_date: 2013-06-03 20:45:15
But we need him! In case bitman is captured!
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:39:40
Well, they were asking *his* opinion right? 
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:55:48
Another note, that cash back isn't given to you by the credit card company. Each different type of card (and there are many) has a different rate as well, those with cash back have a higher rate for the merchant. There is also no real way of knowing for the merchant what rate any given card will have either. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:50:46
An asshole who interrupts award acceptance speeches. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 23:23:18
Yes, it is. But it's very hard for them to enforce. Also getting that out of the contracts is one of the other goals of the lawsuit
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:49:11
So what did you spend all the money on?
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:04:29
What did he do this year anyway? I have no idea.
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:12:36
Litecoin
