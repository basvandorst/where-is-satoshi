This is the funniest shit I've seen all day! I highly doubt Craig is the founder since he refereed to himself as running Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't run by anyone. He's an attention seeker and a liar!  
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:29:23
My spelling doesn't change the fact the domain name is shit. It has no relation to the web site content 
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:32:57
From my understanding there are multiple investment options with them

Has the US government finally siezed Bitcoin.org and blockchain.info to finally shut down decentralized trade amongst "Free" citizens?  
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:16:36
I deleted every single file and folder associated with Electrum and it still shows my wallet data from my old wallet!!!
How do I find the folders on a Mac that is storing my old wallets data? I have no clue how to find the directory. It's not in the applications folder with the electrum program  
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:09:58
So we are probably talking about the low millions? 
@_date: 2014-08-20 02:27:10
Wouldn't there Realcoin be centralized since it's backed by there own stash of dollars? 
@_date: 2014-04-30 08:44:31
Theirs a payment system out there that accepts most alt coins I need to find it 
@_date: 2014-08-09 16:38:42
The dumb fuck was making terrorist threats and not Bitcoin related! 
@_date: 2014-10-15 09:36:49
Holly shit that sucks! Thank you for sharing I was going to buy one and now I will not. I'm very glade I read this post before making my decision! Please keep up posted as to what kind of resolution you guys have!
Possibly they are giving you guys a hard time and keeping your money because you are not in the states? If you where in the US you could easily sue them but since you are in Canada maybe they figure you won't come after them? 
Is there any type of recourse you can take with your bank?  
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:01:31
How are you finding the short positions? 
@_date: 2014-05-01 10:48:37
Is it possible to short the hash? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:20:11
No i didn't save the private key! So I guess my 100 Bitcoins are gone? 
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:54:53
Does you get good business now in Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:01:45
Yeah but it's really dropping now much faster than before! The price has been going sideways for the past 2 or three months 
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:39:03
Well isn't Coinbase in California? If so how are they legally allowed to operate if it's illegal to have Bitcoins in California? From what I saw the law was passed back in January of this year 
@_date: 2014-08-20 03:48:00
I thought they where light years ahead in Technology compared to the US?  
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:53:13
Sounds completed and I can't use electrum every time I try to do a fresh install it imports my old wallets details. Yes I deleted all wallet files from my Mac before reinstalling again 
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:07:25
Why would I write the seed down if I want my old wallet info gone? I opened the terminal and put that in there and it did nothing at all. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:59:58
People get there coins stolen all the time from there wallet service! 
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:13:16
Congratulations looks like my kind of movie, keep everyone posted on the progress! 
@_date: 2014-06-20 11:17:54
You think it could take 6 confirmations? 
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:39:02
No you need to email support I think to do it again
@_date: 2014-05-28 04:05:35
I never fell for anything I'm just inquiring, it smells like shit to me that's why I'm asking on here

Your domain name is shit! 
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:24:30
How do you connect to that? I'm new to IRC and the JAVA version does't work on my MAC
@_date: 2014-05-01 10:04:06
Looks like a scam download fake site to steal Bitcoins! This isn't the original Dark wallet site the original site is here and it's not available for download yet  
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:49:02
All it would do is give the billion dollar monopoly corporations the ability to profit from Bitcoins. If you try to get a money transfer license in California you need tens of millions in assets and a few years of waiting time until you get your denial letter. The companies that decide where you get your money transfer license is Western Union since they helped get the laws passed. Do you think they want a competitor, hell no. Theirs no chance in hell anyone in the United States other than the too big to fail multibillion dollar companies will get these Bitcoin licenses! 
@_date: 2014-03-18 06:20:01
I call bullshit! A unknown company makes 30% of what Overstock.com makes being open less than a year from Bitcoin. They also charge a premium on all products with is ridiculous! 
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:40:56
Where can I found out more about these investments? Also what is Invictus exactly? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:23:57
I thought Bitcoins are not a commodity or currency how the hell can they go to jail for money laundering! Looks like in America when you  try to get rich and your successful you get thrown in prison for a felony
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:23:40
@_date: 2014-08-20 23:04:47
That's fare enough. In that case that guy is an idiot and deserves to go to jail lol     
That's not too bright advertising his company name on a drug site 
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:17:50
I do on my email accounts. That's why my Cryptsy coins where safe 
@_date: 2014-04-30 10:07:19
Do they have any competitors? 
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:06:06
I tried that didn't go so well. The problem is people for some reason give software a way for free and people expect it to be free
@_date: 2014-08-18 11:13:13

@_date: 2014-02-19 22:24:19
How is this good news? Making it legal tender let's California in force mountains of laws that only benefit the mega rich to profit from Bitcoin   
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:53:10
Repeal means making the law null and void. This means it will never be law 
@_date: 2015-05-08 04:18:45
WTF is that and what does that mean? Is that the new Butterfly Labs Miner?  
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:39:50
I never use sites like that 
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:52:08
No it doesn't have a price. I put no added premium 
@_date: 2014-01-28 10:40:35
What a waste of my time 4 fucking hours of bullshit 
@_date: 2014-09-02 01:15:29
What does that mean?

Over 11 confirms now and no credit. I got an email from Coinurl saying sometimes the deposits don't get credited. I still don't have the Balance in in my Coinurl account yet!  
@_date: 2014-06-22 08:50:23
They helped me out and I got my Bitcoin credited to my balance   
@_date: 2014-08-20 22:13:02
Well if he had no idea and you get a jury involved I doubt they would side with the government. I mean unless the guy had magical powers theres no way to avoid that 
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:07:56
I have a video on the site and text that explains very clearly all the benefits. It allows you to accept Bitcoins on your site and you can have the coins sent to any public key instantly 
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:49:11
Here's the transaction  I paid a lot in fees over a $1.00 which I think is rediculous 
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:34:19
So if I send less than a dollar of bitcoin in the future nI have to pay over $1 in transaction fees? 
@_date: 2015-04-21 22:49:42
Did they steal all of your coins when they locked you out? 
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:17:14

@_date: 2015-09-04 17:13:45
Which ones where they considering? 
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:23:16
I heard Trezor has some kind of software issue recently I probably want to avoid them. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:50:26
I just dragged it all the way from one side of my monitor to another and still can't see the complete public keys! This is scary on how it did this on it's own. Do you think I was hacked? I never modified the client I haven't even opened Electrum in over a week! 
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:20:46
I'm staying far away from Coinbase way too many complaints on Reddit about canceling orders after you wait 6 days, no thanks!    
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:34:28
Never they are the biggest economy in the world! To match the price we had before will be next to impossible! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:47:05
Solo mine if you find a block you'll be happy! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:49:54
please elaborate thank you
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:38:42
You can't stop something that is peer to peer with no central authority! They can make anything illegal or not illegal it's not going to change anything! 
Look at torrent web sites it's peer to peer and pirating software and movies is illegal but the majority of the US population doesn't give a shit and does it anyway!  
@_date: 2013-10-26 13:55:32
Right now I move my BTC to btc-e to buy Litecoins but unfortunately I can't take advantage of there super low rates for Bitcoins since I don't want to wait a week to do a wire transfer  
@_date: 2013-10-26 06:17:16
What about for other Crypto currencies? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:39:55
If I wanted to buy $11,000 worth of Bitcoins do you think it would be possible in the same day? Also how long do the Bitcoin withdrawals take? 
@_date: 2013-10-22 01:40:04
You can fund Payeer with a US credit card  Fund the account and then send the money to your Btc-e.com account. Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:45:59
I'm not new 
@_date: 2013-09-23 11:02:43
Why don't people make these and then sell them on eBay or until they sell out. The pre order business model doesn't work!!!
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:58:41
Ubuntu is Unix not Linux! 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:40:15
I'm assuming you're trying to manipulate the market so you can buy some more coins? 
Though I value everyones opinion but paper currency can be lost or stolen and good luck getting paper money back! There is secure measures to protect your bitcoins unlike with tangable paper money. People will take the risk due to the massive profit potential one can get from Bitcoins
Government issued currency like in the US only goes down in value due to inflation unlike Bitcoin. 
Theirs far more upside then downside potential! 
If you have allot of money in Bitcoins distribute them amongst several wallet services and put some in cold storage, don't put all your coins in one wallet! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:36:45
Yes it's legit. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:21:12
I bought on there yesterday and still haven't received my Bitcoins yet. They are very slow sending out the Bitcoins withdrawals! 
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:36:18
How easy was funding your wallet any delays? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:46:36
Thank you I forgot to use step 1. It successfully updated in Ubuntu using the terminal and using the above info 
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:18:30
They don't have an affiliate program! 
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:36:10
How do I uninstall and reinstall Electrum on my PC? I can't find it in the add and remove programs section. Also the Electrum I downloaded from the Ubuntu software section is that a legit copy? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:02:34

@_date: 2013-11-03 20:08:52
0.0005 Bitcoin is around ten cents not one penny! If you don't believe me go to  and type in 0.0005 I get $0.10 which is ten cents!

Do you know how many gigs the blockchain is? It takes over 8 hours to download 
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:38:57
I think I missed the boat on LTC other than LTC what coin is promissing that's well under $1.00 
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:11:17
I transferred all of my Bitcoins into Litecoins 
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:46:09
I verified through that Mii site my bank account and everything. I even logged in with that 2 factor identification, IT DOES NOT WORK!!! FYI BTCQuick doesn't work and I get massive server errors to when I click on the verify link again on the left side of page! Fuck why the fuck do I have to verify again when I already fucking did with that MII site????????????????????????????????????
@_date: 2013-10-26 12:46:08
I live in America I can't use BTC-E and most exchanges it seems like mining is the only way to get coins 
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:54:15
Right now you can use it on as many sites as you want on 1 server. If you want to use it on additional servers you will need to repurchase the plugin for each additional server. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:56:06
The second time 1 wasn't related to me and 1 question I didn't understand  what exactly they were asking me   
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:22:57
Those other methods for Btc-e they accept credit cards for funding options from what I've seen? Maybe they don't accept American credit cards? 
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:13:35
The price will likely drop some more. It takes a while for people to sell Bitcoins. Who knows how low it will go. The price should stabilize in the next few days. 
I'm guessing that each coin will be worth about $20 in the next month     
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:15:41
Could a hacker generate the 12 english words to gain access to your balance and keys? Seems like generating the 12 english words would be much easier than generating the public and private key?
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:57:01
That's not it, the site is not seubscription based you pay to view individual videos! 
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:25:40
No its not! The source code is open source.
@_date: 2013-09-29 11:10:35
Thank you I'll look into that. What exactly is required when coding? That way when I hire a programmer I can tell him what to do. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:26:00
This is my second time the first one I was confused about the whole thing and now it makes allot more sense so my questions are more specific! 
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:04:03
Buy and hold! Stock up on as many as you can afford and don't sell them! Wait until Bitcoin is established before selling by then your investment will turn into a nice nestegg 
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:18:06
Do exchanges need to exist for people to use Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:31:34
What if Electrum goes away that see is worthless, I found out that there is access to private keys
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:40:25
What about being 100% anonymous? Can a alt coin be created without using a Block explorer or block chain? 
@_date: 2013-09-21 15:24:22
Sounds like BS to me. It's easy as pie to get rid of them. Send them to Coinbase and deposit them in your bank account! 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:44:39
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:48:21
It would cost allot of money to make a adult site from scratch. Trying to get some honest feedback before spending the money   
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:54:58
So I just add the short code into the page and it will create the button? I currently have a site that is just HTML only no Wordpress. 
What are some plugins you recommend? 
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:47:38
Coinbase blows I have to wait 6 days for every deposit, not an option! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:45:15
Process everything yourself  
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:39:24
Do not use any online wallets. Cold storage is your only option for holding the coins. Electrum is really good option for daily use walet. If you're using Windows make sure and get a firewall and update it regularly. 
You can also send the coins to a laptop or another computer, once you send those coins to the other computer don't turn it back on if you turn it back on don't connect it to the internet until your ready to spend the coins. Use one computer for storage only and always keep it offline         
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:12:58
Where could you sell these shares and how would you profit from that?
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:15:48
You have to wait 60 days to use! 
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:22:38
How do you make a paper wallet using Blockchain? From my understanding paper wallets are only effective if they're made offline. Making it online defeats the purpose. Once a wallet is connected to the internet it's no longer a paper wallet 
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:07:45
I'm sure the cost of one Bitcoin will be worth thousands in 6 months 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:55:34
If I send over 30 BTC and my identity is not verified but my bank account, email, and everything else is verified  will there be any issues? Also when I sell my coins I get the rate agreed upon when I initiate the sell not when the funds are finally successfully transfered? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:18:09
What happened a few days ago? 
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:53:10
Theirs tons of unresolved cases online of people sending money to Campbx they cash the money order but never credit the accounts. I've never heard of anything negative about btc-e. Coinbase has much higher rates that's why I don't want to use them and their support is very poor from what I heard. 
Every time I contact btc-e support I get a response in less than 24 hours  
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:41:23
$200  to $300 once China sells all there stash 
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:25:41
Well I'm going to be selling not buying so I shouldn't have a delay  
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:49:19
Well you must not have moved around allot! 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:54:49
You're fucked you'll likely never get the money! Welcome to Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:02:30
What if it wasn't handed down what can you do then? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:57:02
Not at all it will be very attractive for people to get in at a much lower price. All we need is India to jump in and we will rise this thing back up. People warned us about China and how they don't like there citizens to make money. They have done something like this in the past 
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:06:20
Well yeah it would need to be exclusive 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:32:53
To send Bitcoins to my Coinbase account I can use any of the public keys in my account settings? I have one in my account settings and I guess that was created when I opened my account 
@_date: 2013-09-29 00:03:39
Do you know of any others?
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:38:48
I suppose you're using Windows? 
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:59:35
None of this is related to his current site. Its been up for months and so far no one has been scammed 
@_date: 2013-09-19 14:28:10
Has anyone tried CampBX? 
@_date: 2013-09-28 21:01:33
Yes but they are third party 
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:58:19
You mean what do you have to gain? The plugin doesn't use any third parties to process orders which means no added fees per transaction. All coins are automatically sent to your wallet of your choice. When you use a third party they usually collect a transaction fee, they also collect allot of personal information amongst other things. You act as your own payment processor, you'll be 100% self contained! 
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:46:27
Thank you that's one of them. Their was anotherone that looked like a tube site 
@_date: 2013-09-26 04:13:38
CampBX freezes your account for 30 days after you open it? How is that good? Sounds inconvenient to me! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:18:14
Yes but the price is out of control it's too rare only 8 million coins 
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:26:59
Its open source I updated the download file. Try again! The original one was encrypted when it was in beta. Now all the files are all open source 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:09:44
If it gets down into the $400 range again I'm going to buy! It did that a couple days ago  
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:52:19
How it's not compatible with Ubuntu?
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:22:39
Fuck no lol!!! Last thing I want is thousands of dollars frozen for weeks 
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:25:40
So it looks like Bitstamp.net and localbitcoins is the best option for me right now? 
@_date: 2013-10-11 06:07:36
No kidding my question was who's the other company I can use for credit cards?
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:00:43
Is that trusted?
@_date: 2013-09-28 21:00:55
How do you set it up with Woocommerce do you need a special plugin? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:15:39
Depositing the money isn't an issue  for me. How's the daily volume? Do you think I would be able to buy a few thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin per day? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:13:53
Lol never heard of those 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:38:07
Hollyshit! That's crazy! Can you still buy and withdrawal funds? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:47:35
Thia is total BS! I tried withdrawing way less than 1 BTC and it told me I had to wait over 4 business days! 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:56:34
Can you do this if your identity isn't verified yet? I verified everything else but there web site keeps crashing when I try to submit my identity information 
@_date: 2013-10-26 11:22:16
So its impossible to make my money back? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:39:42
I was looking for something simple that I can copy ans paste onto my web site 
@_date: 2013-11-16 07:07:23
option contracs are much cheaper than buying the actual asset!
@_date: 2013-10-26 13:13:39
That's a major pain in the ass waiting a week. Plus the have a 10 Bitcoins at a time. I want to buy allot more than what they allow   
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:12:44
So it's buying the coins as a new member is a problem not selling them? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:58:20
What's the exchange that's opening in India?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:59:51
Obviously I'm talking about the question that was related to me. I feel it was a trick question and there was no right or wrong answer there could have been several right answers to the questions

The price is based on the current MtGox exchange rate, so you would need to adjust your price of your product accordingly. The plugin will work on all server types no limitations, the plugin  will still operate on other servers. Theirs no license key to enter just install and run. In terms of limitations there is non.
 Note I have only tested the wallet wallet with Inputs.info and Blockchain I was told it works with all wallets but have not tested all of them personally. Theirs two gateways you install when using the plugin the Inpus one and Blockchain. The Blockchain one can work with most or all wallet types. Just enter your public key and make a random API using any combination of numbers and letters and then it will function perfectly.

I noticed when I click receive Bitcoins button the text above the receiving address says The following address can be used to to receive bitcoins
theirs some grammar errors to to is used twice, is this normal? Also for every new deposit it gives me a new depositing url is that normal also? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:16:26

I'm asking someone to calculate based on current growth not to predict

Camp BX has a much worse reputation from what I've read. I'll be waiting to see how long these ACH payments go through with Camp BX when they implement it 
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:54:41
This plugin doesn't rely on third parties to process Bitcoin payments. That means no added fees! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:56:36
Never mind I had to drag inside of the program it works now 
@_date: 2013-11-01 01:59:10
I've tried my CC never goes threw even though it's active thats not an option!

I'm guessing it's the Chinese. It's strange how they started with Litecoin first. They may dump everything it could be a bunch of rich bankers 
@_date: 2013-09-19 13:57:55
I did that with Blockchain it seemed to work  
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:53:33
From my understanding the US Gov is going to police it using this Coinvaladation thing, sorry I'm a little confused 
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:29:00
Any detailed online documentation of this Coinvalidation thing? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:11:36
The jump has been equally significant lately with Litecoin vs Bitecoin 
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:27:26
Wow 6 fucking days when I can buy from someone on Localbitcoins today why would I use Coinbase? If I decide to use the 6 day route and I going to get the coins at that guaranteed rate? If the coins go down to $100 dollars I'll be fucked 6 days from now? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:48:53
I've tried the installer doesn't work for me. Any very good online tutorials on how to get this to work?

@_date: 2013-10-30 12:56:35
Is there a website on this? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:34:24
Ok it updated now when I click on receive I can't see the public keys I can only see an abbreviated keys with only the first two letters for each key. How can I get back to before where I can see the entire public keys when you click on receive? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:50:15
Use localbitcoins next time! Get the coins in person, no bullshit or waiting!
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:06:00
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:39:37
Theirs probably more horror stories from Campbx than Coinbase and Mtgox combined so I'll stay away from them also 
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:16:49
Is that website profitable? How's the stats? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:49:56
I click on BTC/Actions button then I click on Depsosit/autosell option? 
Do I create a new key for every transaction? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:19:13
I wanted to and would have when it went down bellow $80 a month or so ago. I bought when it got to $200 and have been riding it up ever since! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:41:57
Stablecoin is the best alt right now! 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:13:32
That's why you have them verify there age before purchasing by entering there birthdate and agreeing to the terms    
@_date: 2013-10-26 13:29:42

Okcoin.com check it out! Okcoin has almost double the volume as Mtgox!!! 
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:27:49
I'll never be able to buy instantly since I don't have a Visa credit card just a debit card 
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:16:32
It's overly inflated I'm waiting for a pullback! It's due for a major correction! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:47:01
I'm posting here Because allot of people who have Bitcoins also have Litecoins! 
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:07:29
You can use any wallet with mine you don't have to use Blockchain 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:53:33
Yeah before this debacle  with China!
@_date: 2013-10-14 00:43:06
Why is Dwolla not doing anything Bitcoin related anymore? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:23:55

Ok random guy on the internet! I'm sure the thief will fork over the money to another thief!!! 
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:30:33
It's not free I charge for it on my web site. WooCommerce has one and they charge allot more than what I charge for mine. 
Third party processors give them away but you have to use their third party processor, my plugin eliminates the need to rely on a third party to process your payments. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:17:39
I have no reason to expect them just curious if I was missing something. On the site it says I can withdrawal up to 50 BTC at a time so thats good! 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:31:25
They are the biggest economy in the world! We are fucked it will never be the same! 
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:25:29
I noticed on there web site theirs other options other than a wire transfer. You can use a foreign Pay Pal money transfer types of businesses. Not sure which one of those is legit since I've never used any of them. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 11:02:01
That really sucks! 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:23:40
Nothing goes up forever there needs to be a correction. We should see a nice dump soon. I wouldn't be suprised if Fontase is behind some of the Litecoin rise! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:44:32
So if the market cap is 1.2T then the price will be $100,000 per coin? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:22:13
What if I want to go through the same installation process will all my settings be lost?
