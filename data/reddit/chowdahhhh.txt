N00b question: What does this mean...?
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:44:01

Disappointing "crash"

Or, maybe he decided to hodl it and wait until everyone forgot that he would donate it?

It's not a Coinbase issue. Bitcoin is just a bad form of payment right now. Sell it back and use Ethereum or Litecoin

My crystal ball tells me the answer is 4

You only actually lose or gain when you exit a position. If Bitcoin dropped from $5000 to $2500 you would have -$2500 in unrealized gains/losses. If it goes back up to $5000, you'll be back at even. 


This is why people say just to hold. If you ride out all the ups and downs, you will come out ahead if you believe the price will rise.
But, something to think about: If Bitcoin falls from $5000 to $2500, that's equivalent to -50%. In order to rise back to $5000 from $2500, Bitcoin would have to rise 100% to get back to those levels, which is arguably more difficult. In investing, it's always easier to lose money than to gain.

Cost average your way in. There's no reliable way to time the market. Maybe buy some today, buy some next week, and the week after. Put some money on the side for a dip. Then pray.

Market cap = Price per coin*Quantity of coins
The price affects the market cap.

But as long as the transaction has not been recorded in the blockchain, the cake buying individual is free to cancel the transaction in the mempool after he eats the cake. So yes, not waiting for a transactions to be confirmed by subsequent blocks is a problem. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:17:33
It is possible. 
You contradict yourself saying that it's impossible and then going on to tell me how a double spend transaction occurs... Maybe it's not easy? But it's possible. Anyhow miners don't give a shit about the transactions that make it into the block. They're going to put the highest fee transactions in the block. 
LOL ok buddy. Mempool is empty, and no one is sending you bitcoin. Nice try tho.

It is not just the cake transaction that would be invalidated. It is all transactions in the same block as the cake transaction. If said block contains ANY other fraudulent transactions big or small, this cake transaction could be rejected. So technically it would make sense to make a customer wait around for at least 1 or more confirmations to eliminate risk. But, that's not really pragmatic, so accepting the risk of a block rejection is the risk you take when using Bitcoin in cases like these. A faster, cheaper fee crypto would eliminate such risk.
