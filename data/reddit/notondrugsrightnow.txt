Nobody knows what the price will do so it's simply a gamble. You could invest today and the price could drop to 400 tomorrow. Just as possible as the price going to 1200. Nobody knows. Anybody who tells you otherwise is lying. Investing in Bitcoin is pretty much the same as putting your money on black or red. You win or you lose. Massive gains or massive losses are possible. 
Personally i'd say right now is a bad time to invest based on previous experience. We're entering a bubble and euphoria is peaking. For real investors this is usually a time to get out. And again from past experience with Bitcoin this again is true. 
But who knows, it might go to 2000 this time. But i doubt it. 
You need to invest when people here are leaving. When they are getting out be ause the price is dropping. When we're in a bear market. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 06:09:21
Yeah and mainly a get rich without working thing. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:17:01
Like what exactly? Can you show me some examples of unsubstantiated garbage i posted? Truly curious. 
Edit. And no answer. Just another downvote. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:07:43
Every other post is a moon post. We're getting close. 
Funny how all those posts about poor Indians and Venezuelans completely dissapeared by the way. 
It's almost like they were simply used to pump the price and now that we indeed are going up nobody gives a shit about them anymore. 
But i'm sure bitcoiners aren't like that. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:43:22
Which parts aren't facts you'd say?
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:09:38
Pure speculation. Nobody knows where the price will go. It might crash in the next hour. 
If you were so sure you wouldn't be posting here right now. You would be at your bank taking out a huge loan. But you aren't. For obvious reasons. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:19:36
Yeah it's all possible i guess. It's pretty much impossible to find out at this point. 
I just hope the crash this time won't be anywhere near the 2013 one and resulting in another years long bear market. 
I see way less media attention this time. Way less hype. Way less "tourists" getting in who panic every time someone farts. 
The exchanges feel lees scared. That's why i haven't sold my coins yet. While i did during the 2013 bubble. 
Maybe i'm wrong though. But i'm gonna wait for now and see where this goes. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:48:55
I'll take em for 500. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:38:56
God, you're edgy. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:38:18
I didn't. Why would i? He is the one making a crazy claim. Not me. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:01:56
Someone else called me a troll but couldn't point out 1 troll post. But i'm sure you can. Right?
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:54:40
Complete nonsense. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:24:12
Ya i edited my post. Fuck facts and reality!
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:48:59
Why Bitcoin? There are tons of safer options than Bitcoin. 
Yes, their situation is fucked. And yes, advising them to invest in a highly volatile near unusable internet currency is equally fucked. 
It's insane to suggest they should put what little wealth they have in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:03:39
Yes. Exactly. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 12:07:31
So what will you tell them? SFYL? Better luck next time?
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:38:53
We had no idea!
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:50:45
Halvening? No. 
india? Hell no. 
China bots pumping the price? Very possible. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:52:49
Interesting. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:32:45
I'll let her now to hang on as she will be rich in 3 years from now!
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:18:13
Can you show me one troll post i made? 
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:59:29
How am i trolling exactly?
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:38:01
Haha are you new here? 
@_date: 2016-12-22 12:18:45
Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:15:49
Another clickbait article. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:53:25
Care to answer my question?
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:44:20
Future, who knows. We are talking about now and recent history. My post was a reaction to his. Your post is irrelevant in this conversation. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:05:20
Nothing but speculation in that article presenting it as facts. 
Why the downvotes? Seriously why? What am i possibly saying that deserves to be downvoted?
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:02:26
Wait, i have a question first to see how far detached from reality you are. 
Is there in your world somehow the slightest possibility that what we are seeing currently on the Chinese exchanges are not inflated numbers and bots but all real trades by real humans?
Answer me that first please. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 19:47:30
At least 2 minutes. Why?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:55:47
Don't be ridiculous. The last day was not slowly. The last few days is a hype, a bubble. Really, i can't believe i'm even typing out something so obvious. 
I won't respond if you make another ridiculous post like that. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:24:44
Of course!
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:33:25
Sorry i upset you so much. 
Next time i'll stick to the Bitcoin investors guide: buy buy buy! Nothing can go wrong!
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:16:29
I bet they can't wait to spend the money they don't have on a highly volatile internet currency they can't use for anything. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 10:17:07
Yes. A scam that gets posted every 30 mins. How the mods can't ban that url is just weird. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:28:37
Lots of people bought at 800 or higher. So they get really excited when we get close to that number again. And others simply think it will go up endlessly so they're already shopping for Ferrari's. 
We're close to euphoria peak. Which usually results in a big crash. It's the same every single time yet many here every single time think this time it will be different. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 02:47:31
@_date: 2016-12-18 11:29:37
Are you taking out a loan right now to invest it all in these extremely cheap coins?
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:04:16
Because there is no sudden increased user adoption. There is no reason for this fast price surge. 
And that's also why it worries me. 
It looks "fake". 
I rather go up slowly based on real increased user adoption instead of blindly following Chinese bots and fake trades. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:47:32
Right. And this all happened in the last 2 days. 
These are all real people desperatly escaping capital controls in the last 48 hours! 
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:25:16
Here's any idea. If that guy is hated so much here then stop making a post every time he farts. 
I know nothing about the guy yet i see his name here posted every single day. It's post like this that make me believe he is actually really important and people follow evetything he does. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:28:51
Yes i know what a short it. Not sure how this is relevant. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:13:43
Let me guess. Bitcoin would solve everything?
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:32:02
Bitcoin user not affected!
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:57:17
C'mon man. We're not 900 yet and we already had like 4 similar posts. Calm down. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:20:34
Why are you not attacking the guy who accused the OP of being a troll and shill? Why is my comment bad but his isn't?
Sorry, that baffles me. 
And that second link, those are facts. What is possibly bad about that post? Simply facts you don't like?
Sorry, those examples are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:00:03
Take your meds. 
That first nick i had to abandon because several of the cult members here started threatening me through PM. Because i dared to point out several non-positive things about Bitcoin. (But i'm sure you have no problem with that). The second nick got banned. A reason was never given but again i'm sure it's because of batshit crazy conspiracy theorists like you reporting me for god knows what. 
Next i'm gonna ask you to find me one racist or troll post i made. 
But we both know you won't because you can't find any. Instead you just will keep spreading lies and reporting me for made up things in your sick brain. 
Go see a doctor you freak!
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:22:16
Yes mainly the last few days. It's a pump. Not sudden increased adoption. 
There is increased adoption world wide but it wouldn't reflect in the prices this rapidly. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 13:00:18
Because the people who own them give them value. Right now we decided they are worth 790. Paper money is just paper. Worthless. They are given a value. Same goes for Bitcoin. Just 0 and 1's. Worthless. Unless several people give it value. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 14:32:52


Is there any evidence whatsoever that the Chinese are using Bitcoin for that? Because i've certainly haven't seen any. Is there anyone from China here that can confirm this claim?
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:24:00
What supercomputer did you have in mind?
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:52:32
Which parts aren't proven you'd say?
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:58:05
Good. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:29:16


You completely changed the subject. Like completely. 
Edit: did you seriously just downvote me??
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:09:45
Which troll posts exactly? Can you show me a few?
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:53:25
Now it goes up. Tomorrow and the next 3 months it might go down. May i remind you how many people bought at 1000+ during the 2013 hype? This sub screamed buy buy buy! You will be rich! Last chance to buy this cheap! 
We were at 200 a few months later. People lost their life savings. And those who screamed buy buy buy? Nowhere to be found. 
My point is that Bitcoin is an extremely unsafe investment. Advising people who are lost money due to their unsafe currency to invest in another unsafe currency is just crazy. 
These people have nothing. You want them to move what little they have to Bitcoin. And tomorrow the price crashes to 500 and you know what people like you will say?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:09:20
Absolutely possible. I personally doubt it but it sure is possible. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 01:44:37
Butthurt about what??
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:22:45
You should know when and when not you should post that link and look really smart. This is not one of those moments because anybody with an average iq knows this is bs. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:09:10


That happened 
@_date: 2016-12-18 10:57:04
No need to warn us. They're all scams. I'm sure that noone here is stupid enough to still send money to these people. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:09:04
India's Bitcoin market is extremely small. That's a fact. You have to look at the facts instead of the tons of clickbait articles here posted daily. 
The halvening could be a factor in general of course. But it isn't the reason the price goes up suddenly now. Doesn't make any sense. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:09:38
And none of these things are a reason to suddenly go up 100's. 
Go take a look in the real world instead of this echo chamber where the same 50 pump articles get posted every day. 
No, Venezuela isn't moving to Bitcoin, neither is India nor any other country. No, people all over the world aren't suddenly buying like crazy. 
The only thing i see happening is crazy inflated Chinese numbers and greedy western gamblers following them. 
This has nothing to do with user adoption. 
Aaaand downvotes. God this sub. Anything else but "yes, this is only because of user adoption" will get you downvoted to fuck. Just sad. Really fucking sad. Even if i'm wrong can you people not discuss things like an adult without downvoting every post you don't like? How do you people get by in real life when you talk to someone? 
@_date: 2016-12-21 06:08:50
You act surprised that pretty much anyone here is in it simply to get rich. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:10:58
You sinner! 
Excommunicate the sinner!
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:15:17
Well something doesn't add up. 
According to this sub we're seeing massive user adoption right now. So we should be seeing another huge spike. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:45:29
And there we go. The OP is a troll and shill for saying something different than the usual "buy buy buy!!".
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:04:06
No but she looks similar. Life has been rough on her since she invested in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:34:00
Of course! What could possibly go wrong!
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:41:53


Yes, obviously. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:00:33
Sorry, i'm not gonna play this stupid and childish game. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:06:48
And it sure does affect me as i own more coins than you ever will. 
I made more money in the last day than you probably do in a few months. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 14:34:11
I'm pretty fucking confident that right now on this planet there are more people who want to pay for designer bags and trading cards than Bitcoin. And with more i mean shitloads more. 
But why do you only talk about that anyway? Euros, dollars, metals, paypal, there are just so many other things besides bitcoin. Safer things. 
But nevermind. Bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin. Bitcoin will save Venezuela. Bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin. Bitcoin. Nothing else on this planet is worth anything. Bitcoin. Bitcoin. Nowhere else is your money secure but bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:39:55
Doubt it but if the price keeps rising it might be possible. Use an online calculator. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:26:15
To warm up the place? Sure. To make money? No. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:26:11
Yes obviously. 
Anything is else gets downvoted to hell though, just to make sure. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:10:14
How much did you buy? 
Oh wait, nothing. You want others to buy so your coins will be worth more. 
You remind me of the people in this sub during the price peak at 1200. Post after post telling others to invest. 
Buy now! Put all your money in it! Last chance! We will never see these prices again! This time it's real!
Of course when we were back at 200 a few months later they were nowhere to be found. They sold their libertarian freedom coins for filthy fiat and got out. And now those who are holding these "cheap coins" are repeating the process. 
It's sickening. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:36:25
The weak hand myth. Can we eliminate it please. I cringe every time i read it. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:07:14
Yes, a few 100 or maybe even a few 1000 people in Venezuela buy or sell coins. What's your point?
@_date: 2016-12-20 10:19:17
Yes ok. Nothing can go wrong anymore. You're right. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:37:45
I've seen so many posts like this during the 2013 bubble and several pumps in the last few years. 
You know the one thing you "this time it's real" people all have in common? When the price goes down again not one of you will make a post admitting you were wrong and your analysis was full of shit. Not one!
Nobody knows where this will go but if you think a sudden 150 dollar price rise is because of sudden world wide user adoption in 24 hours then you are highly delusional. Even more so as you can see the Chinese exchanges pumping like crazy with inflated numbers. 
But don't worry. You posted at the right place obviously. Looking at my previous posts anything other than "user adoption" gets downvoted to hell. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:12:24
What crash? Also did you somehow think the price can only go up or something?
@_date: 2016-12-19 02:22:05
And your link might be a scam as well. Typical case of scamception. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:01:33
Neither am i sure. 
And believe me, i want the price to go up. I have a lot of money involved. 
I just like to say sober and realistic about the current price rise as i know how quickly it can turn around. Many here like to forget that. 
I've seen this euphoria and "this time it's different" thing followed by a crash plenty if times now. 
The fact that we are following Chinese bots and inflated numbers as what controls the price very much worries me. 
To me all this euphoria here pushes my finger to the sell button. But it's difficult. It might go way higher. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 11:05:25
Many Bitcoiners consider feeeemales something you own. They just hodl their coin till they get filthy rich and then buy a female or 2. The female does need to worry about things like how does Bitcoin work. She just needs to know how to cook and raise the little neckbeards while neckbeard sr protects his land. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:28:41
Because we all know bitcoiners aren't in it to get rich!
@_date: 2016-12-20 01:07:31
Let me try to figure out your crazy logic. 
It seems that you are saying that somehow cash will be banned everywhere and there is no other solution left than Bitcoin. 
So with cash gone anybody who doesn't use Bitcoin will starve to death. Because nobody will own money anymore. 
No seriously, what insane ideas about the future do you have exactly?
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:40:48
And still you can't show me 1 real troll post. And we both know why. It's because i'm not trolling whatsoever. 
The thing is you hate me because i'm not joining the circle jerk. And that's all. That's all there is to it. 
You are stalking me and calling me a troll because i'm not positive enough about Bitcoin for your liking. 
Your behavior is pretty extremely cultish and kinda creepy. You realize that, right?
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:21:20
The worst that can happen is a few 100 dollars drop in 2 years??
Man, that could literally happen in the next hour. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:13:21
They won't. Way too unpredictable. Bitcoin is a gamble. Big companies don't like to gamble. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:01:22
Why are you stalking and harassing me?
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:56:51


Oh shit, busted!
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:24:16
Yes i have done my homework. 
A few 100 people buying in Venezuela isn't causing this sudden price surge. It really isn't. Neither in Australia or anywhere else. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:36:58
It's hilarious how all day i got downvoted, ridiculed and called a troll when i said China is leading this pump. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:32:17
So you are asking us to upvote instead?
@_date: 2016-12-12 00:07:59
Who is supposed to answer this exactly?
@_date: 2016-12-11 22:41:06
Yes, buying games on Steam works great. I bought so much already. 
I wish there were more big sites like that using Bitcoin. I honestly have no other use for my coins. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:42:22
Calm down first. 
Breathe. Puff puff. Breathe. 
Nobody knows what the price will do. This pump might stop in the next minute. When you understand that then calm down some more and then think about your next step. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 01:43:11
And what if Bitcoin drops a few 100 in the next few days? Like it has done several times before and most likely will do several times ij the future?
Sorry but i think it's crazy and kinda disgusting how many people here want people who have huge problems with a highly unsafe currency to invest in another highly unsafe currency. For one reason of course. Because they are also invested in it. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:05:23
Again, which parts aren't a fact? Can you post at least one?
I posted 3:
A lot of bots on the Chinese exchanges. Highly inflated numbers. The west blindly following the east. 
Which are not facts?
Are you gonna answer me this time or just call me some more names and then tell me i'm immature. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:29:43
Let me guess. Anybody who isn't 100% euphoric is a troll?
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:13:16
So i take you can't actually show me one troll post?
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:42:46
Traders trading and people buying trying to make profit. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:30:49
I just explained you something. Just stop. It's getting hard to watch. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:20:07
This is getting ridiculous. I am called a troll for saying China is pumping the price and leading this rally but the last 5 price posts here don't even the use the western price anymore. They use the Chinese price!
@_date: 2016-12-20 01:35:45
Nobody is gonna use Bitcoin as a hedge against volatility. Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:09:32
My simple theory is inflated numbers and bots on the Chinese markets. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:02:23
Tbh this applies to quite a few Bitcoiners. 
Hahaha downvoted of course. Because this applies to no bitcoiners!
Not one! Everyone here is a currency, math and investing genius!
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:36:26


You just pulled that out of your ass. You have no clue what people do with these coins. 


Yes, aware of that. What are you trying to say?
Anyway, 19 million world wide a week is nothing in the financial world. This wouldn't even register. Calling this incredibly high is delusional. It's incredibly low. Very, very incredibly low. Just stop with these completely ridiculous pump posts. If this is what Bitcoin needs then it failed. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:03:47
Yes of course it is. But saying that is not allowed here. My above post got 7 downvotes so far. The only answer allowed: natural growth and fundamentals. I mean, what else could it be right?
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:37:13
Gimme a break. We've had 200 threads already how they should start buying bitcoin. There are maybe 2 people here actually donating. The rest wants them to buy coins so the price goes up. And i'm pretty sure you are aware of that. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:20:42
Up up up till it goes down down down. Stop acting like that isn't possible. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:45:37
Nobody knows but i personally think it is. I see no evidence for crazy adoption suddenly. None whatsoever. All i see is Chinese exchanges inflating their numbers and the west blindly following it in pure euphoria. 
As soon as the Chinese pump stops and 1 whale dumps 5k coins to spread fear we might be back at 500 in hours. 
Edit. Thanks for downvoting my opinion. Crazy. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 01:34:03
You don't make any sense whatsoever. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:25:11
Spreading FUD?  What?
Wtf are you talking about? Why are you stalking me and harassing me?
Can the mods do something about this creep please? I'm pretty sure harassment is not allowed here. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:22:48
Yeah thanks but the reason i own a lot of coins is because i bought in early, sold during the 2013 bubble and bought in at the bottom again. And i repeated this on a smaller scale over the years. 
It's not rocket science. Euphoria? Sell. Desperation? Buy. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:06:21
Well check my post history and downvotes to see how that goes. 
I'm only gonna post positive things from now on. People here will try to destroy you if you don't. 
Oops, this was aimed at the OP. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:09:18
They won't collapse. They will be bailed out. 
When posting these already off-topic articles then at least keep the title intact instead of making up sensationalist titles yourself. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 01:45:15
Great. I bookmarked this post. Will you let is know soon how it went? Are shall i remind you in 2 weeks?
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:02:51
Are you saying that the Chinese exchanges don't have inflated numbers? Something they admit themselves. 
Are you saying there are no bots on those exchanges??
Are you truly calling this a conspiracy theory?? Because that would be pretty crazy. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:41:21
Bullshit! Complete bullshit. 
Totally normal post. Downvoted!
Same thing. 
That was 1 sentence. Completely normal. Downvoted to fuck. 
My tone, hilarious. I simply get downvoted and harassed for pointing out this is a Chinese pump. Which everyone knows it is but most here simply don't like this fact. It's insane what's going on. Pure propaganda and then censorship of those who don't accept it. There are people activaly stalking me here at the moment and downvoting every post i make. It's crazy!
Stop attacking me. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:25:38
Ah right. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:53:40
Huh? Why? What did i say that upset you?
@_date: 2016-12-12 12:18:52


Stop using this ridiculous argument. A consumer doesn't care it takes months to finalize. He wants his transaction to go through immediately. And credit cards do this. Hell, that it takes months is a actually a good thing for the consumer as this gives them the security of a chargeback.
What you pretend is a bad thing is actually something that will prevent people from switching to Bitcoin. 
And to the OP. You are right about the fees. It will stop mainstream adoption. A system that requires a fee every single time you make a transaction simply never will go mainstream. 
And there is nothing wrong with that. Bitcoin had its uses and works fine for a small group of people. Including me. 
We need to stop pretending governments and complete countries will start using it. That's just crazy thinking. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:02:42
Ah yes, when the dollar goes down. Any day now!
And i am wondering, after these poor Venezuelans put their life savings in Bitcoin per your advice and the price crashes 50%, which is very possible as we all know and very likely will happen again in the future, what will you tell them? SFYL?
Bitcoin has it uses. Calling it a safe haven is completely insane though. There is nothing safe about Bitcoin. Nothing. 
And yes, buying the right designer bags is way safer than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:51:52
Or if the Chinese pump stops straight to 700. Nobody knows. That includes Vinny. 
You'd think all these Bitcoin "experts" learned from the past. The past filled with one crazy prediction after the other that were all wrong. But no. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:36:52
The price is 400 dollars below what it was 3 years ago. 
Calm down. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:42:31
Right. I'll make another one. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:20:42
Chinese traders pumping the price. As anyone can see by looking at the exchanges for 30 seconds. I truly see no other reason for the price rise. Were following China. They go up, we go up. They go down, we go down. 
People will tell you venezuela, India etc. If you actually look at their volume you'll see it's tiny. So tiny i doubt it could move the price one dollar. Let alone 100's. 
And instantly downvoted for giving my opinion in a post that asks about opinions. Well done Well done!
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:06:35
The blockchain the heart of the financial industry?
How high is that writer?
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:14:50
Bitcoin user not affected. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:17:31
Who is supposed to answer this? Last time i checked Nostradamus doesn't post here. Nobody knows what Bitcoin will do in the future. Not one single person on this planet. 
If you want to take the gamble then invest and if you don't then don't. Don't let random people on the internet tell you what to do with your money. That's absurd. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:11:38
A known troll? What?
Where am i trolling exactly? Can you show me?
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:50:16
If it does then within 5 years. If it doesn't within that time then i consider it a failed experiment. 10.000 is nothing if we see real world wide adoption. If we can't reach that in 12 years total then i'm gonna assume something better will take over Bitcoin. Which will eventually happen anyway. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:18:08
Ah yes, they need to spend their 6 dollars a month on Bitcoin! That will magically solve everything!
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:37:24
Wtf? Are you serious right now?
@_date: 2016-12-18 01:58:51
No point in talking to you any more. You prefer fantasy and faith. I'll stick to facts and reality. 
Good luck spreading the word in Venezuela. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:08:56
I hope so but i doubt it. When you see the dozens of clickbait articles posted here every single day telling us how Bitcoin is exploooooooding in Venezuela it's very easy for the hivemind to actually believe this. Especially if they already want to believe this. 
And anyone who posts that it might not be this wide spread at all will instantly be labelled a troll, be downvoted and reported. Which is happening to me right now. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:30:53
Ok, you're right. Venezuela and India and Australia are the reason were suddenly going up crazy fast. You win. Several 100, maybe a few 1000 people there are the reason the price is going up 100's. 
You're right. What else could it possibly be!
We're not really following the Chinese. Only a fool would think that. 
Nope, sudden massive user adoption it is. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:48:38
This has to be the most idiotic theory so far. Quite insane actually. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:57:16
Excuse me?
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:30:44
The Japanese government is buying up Bitcoin? Is this seriously a theory you consider even slightly plausible??
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:23:40
You predicted the price would go up?
@_date: 2016-12-10 02:40:51
This is a scam. It gets posted over and over again. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:44:57
I got downvoted to hell all day long for pointing out this is all one big China pump. 
I love how at the same time we're celebrating how China pumps the price a bit higher. 
So you can't mention how this is not user adoption but simply China pumping the price but you can be euphoric about it. 
Confusing. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:26:23
Oh wow, i'm terribly sorry! 
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:25:30
I wish i made a list of all these crazy predictions every year. 100's if not 1000's of reasons why Bitcoin will go to the moon NEXT year!
It would be a good and sobering read. 
Oh and let's not forget the Bitcoin "experts" who predict next year we will see 10, 20, 100k per coin!
Ah next year! Next year i will be filthy rich!
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:24:39
Because you can't show me where i'm wrong you just attack me instead. Fuck, that was sad to read. And you call me an immature child. Hilarious. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:33:24
Yeah no hacks, no Satoshis being found and no countries banning Bitcoin. That would be great for once. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:08:34
Ah yes, Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:05:12
Huh? What has that law to do with Bitcoin user adoption??
Edit: your answer doesn't even matter. We simply did not have sudden increased adoption in the last few days causing this price rise. No matter how many theories you can come up with. 
There is a pump going. We're following the Chinese exchanges. Why this is so incredibly hard to hard accept in this place is beyond me. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:49:09
How euphoric are you right now?
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:11:44
Can someone explain to me the obsession this sub has with the guy and why anyone would give a crap what he says or does? What is his power? What can he do that we need to listen to him?
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:37:16
Useless comparisson when there are way more coins now. Seriously, what's the point?
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:55:26
I'm euphoric as fuck!
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:22:48
Uh what??
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:59:46
I'm thinking of selling. Maybe half of what i own. Not sure yet. 
Everything so far points to another bubble that may crash at any time. If you think this price rise is because of sudden user adoption then you're delusional. 
The Chinese bots are pumping and the Chinese exchanges inflating their numbers. It's not healthy. 
This sub is reaching euphoria peak which is usually a selling sign. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:02:00
With that i can fully agree. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:56:47
You're creepy. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 11:28:48
What makes you think some random dude with 3 coins knows more than the rest of us?
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:46:26
Steam mostly. Drugs sometimes and just general items here and there depending on who accepts coins. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:42:11
Hold on, are you saying the Chinese exchanges don't have inflated numbers (which is a common fact, admitted by at least one exchange owner) and that they are full of trading bots?
These are not facts according to you??
Funny how i also don't see you asking for evidence when people make crazy claims about user adoption or other "this is good for Bitcoin" things. 
You seem very selective in what you consider unsubstantiated garbage. It seems to be based on this is good for Bitcoin or this is not good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:37:06
As always: no. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:05:41


They forgot that part in the clickbait title. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:44:49
Not behind my computer right now but there should be a buy link after you login, no?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:44:45
Are you also gonna contact him when the price went down 5% after paying him? And telling him SFYL? Or only when it goes up?
Your way of pushing Bitcoin in people's faces is just bad business. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:23:25
Bitcoin can drop 100's in hours. How is this possibly gonna protect their wealth? It's probably the least safe thing they could invest in. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:25:50
People like you expecting it?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:19:58
You just called everything that is different from your view rubbish. Man up when someone responds to it. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 15:34:45
Because Bitcoin is so predictable and stable, right?
If i wanted to hedge against uncertainty Bitcoin would be the last thing i would put my money in. 
Now if i wanted to gamble and go for all or nothing i would buy Bitcoin. Which i did. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:33:21
These threads are now getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:20:38
But it sure is a huge part of it. Anybody with eyes and an
iq above 70 can take a look at the exchanges and confirm that. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:48:58
Why the hell wouldn't it be legal?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:00:33
Are you gonna show me one post where i am trying to push the price down or man the fuck up and admit you were wrong? Which will it be?
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:56:02
Wow, such a surprise! You can't either! Absolutely did not see that coming!
It's crazy how you are so fucking angry and upset and call me a troll simply because i pointed out some things you don't like to hear. 
Maybe you need to get some fresh air or something. Your behavior is not healthy. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 02:12:24
Nope, sorry. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:28:22
I'm sure no one thought about that in the last 7 years!
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:33:28
What frontier? Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:31:54
I'm sure they do?
And I hope more people will. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:31:34
It's a reaction to the shitpost by the OP. 
Is this truly all you can find? 
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:36:30
The price should not matter whatsoever if you use Bitcoin to escape the system. 
But as we all know the price is the only thing that truly matters here. And let's not forget the part where the majority will sell their coins for dirty fiat when the price is high enough. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:51:40


People selling


Not at this point and most likely not in the future. But anything is possible. 


Those who know won't tell you. Nobody is gonna tell you how to get rich. 


Nothing points to that at the moment. 


Highly unlikely they will use Bitcoin for that. Is that a threat to bitcoins value? Could be. Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:35:05
No idea. Many here seem to suggest that though. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:31:09
Your meds, take them. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:35:27
How are there still people who don't simply ignore all these cloud mine sites? 99% are scams and the rest are not worth it. 
What is it with the obession with these sites. Just ignore them like you would with any other obvious scam. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:01:19
Bitcoin user not affected! Oh wait, wrong thread!
@_date: 2016-12-15 16:16:52
No, sorry, it isn't. It's far from safe and not one serious investor on this planet will be like "bond market crashing? Oh wait, let me put my money in Bitcoin instead!".
There may be several reasons the price is going up and this is not one of them. Unrelated to Bitcoin. Article doesn't belong here. Neither do the 100 other general financiel news articles poster here every day. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:54:49
I bought my first coins at 20 bucks you dumbass. You were probably 15 back then. If i showed you how much i own you'd shit your pants. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:03:44


Haha ok. It's cute that you actually believe that. 


Source? Also how high exactly? 800 per coin not enough? Only at 1200 they suddenly will take it seriously? 1500 maybe?
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:48:52
Looks like i hit a nerve. 
Nice language by the way. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:08:09


When you can't seperate fantasy from reality anymore you know it's time to visit the doc. Do it now before it gets worse!
Funny those downvotes. As if there are people here who seriously believe that quote. 
ALL his friends and family are buying like crazy and ask him every dingle say about Bitcoin. Everyone knows this is bullshit yet if you say it is you get downvoted. Crazy. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:48:12
I'm not talking about trading. Not sure why you are. Did you reply to the wrong person?
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:27:29
Doesn't blockchain.info allow buying now?
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:58:51
Yeah, what could possibly go wrong! Amazing logic. No investor is not gonna jump in after reading this!
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:49:11
First tell us if you are about to restore 10k coins which you are gonna dump on an exchange. Hehe. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 15:47:53
Nothing. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:06:22
What we seeing are a lot of bots and highly inflated Chinese numbers. That's a fact. 
One bot pumping the price though, i doubt it. 
But one thing is for sure. This rally is not healthy and the bubble will pop. When and how far down is impossible to predict. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 22:56:26
No way, just no way you went through my post history like that??
Fuck, that's creepy. Really fucking creepy!
Edit: that's like 5 pages of post history! 
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:27:09
100kg gold bar. Hilarious. 
Just make up some ridiculous stuff to show how amazingly superior Bitcoin is, right?
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:14:18
Which of the above aren't facts according to you? 
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:56:13
Why am i here? Wtf? As a Bitcoin owner, why shouldn't i be here? I like to discuss Bitcoin things. Just like you are here. I didn't realize i need to have exactly the same opinion as you to be allowed here?
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:07:24
And we need to guess where you opened that account or something?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:03:28
Yes they were. Don't tell me you think this stays always at the same level. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:02:59
If they kept their money in socks, under their bed, in Paypal, in gold, in silver, in bonds, in euros, in dollars, in designer bags, in trading cards in 100 other things it wouldn't have happened either. And pretty much all of those things would've been safer and more usable than Bitcoin. 
Stop pretending Bitcoin is their only way out. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:25:10
19 million a WEEK world wide is something you consider incredibly high?? Are you high or trolling right now?
I noticed all you do all day is pump Bitcoin with bs titles like this. 
If anything it tells me you are extremely desperate. 
Why can't you just stick to facts and stop with the pump posts. Try to discuss Bitcoin like you are not some kid with 2 coins trying to get rich quick. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 10:18:42
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:38:42
Yeah, no. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 03:18:01
Chinese bots. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:12:45
Again nothing but personal attacks. God, this is pathetic. 
And the fact that you went through my account because i said some things about Bitcoin you don't like is..well..fucking crazy. You have some serious issues. 
I also can't believe i wasted this much time on a troll. Bye. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 10:00:21
Funny how each and everyone of you completely ignore my point and come up with some shitty excuse why this doesn't count instead. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:16:31
And those who bought coins at 1250 dollars back in 2013, are they winning as well?
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:20:23
No. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:24:27
Ooooh ok!
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:08:15
Ah yes, which in turn makes you look real mature. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:19:54


Wow, how nice of you. Millions, billions will suffer but finally you will be rich! We Bitcoiners are all waiting for this!


Won't happen. Don't be ridiculous. 


Haha no of course not. Where the hell did you get this crazy idea?


Take a guess. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:11:00
Hype. More people buying than selling. 
Thanks for the instant downvote. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:18:31
Awesome dude! 
Damn, i wish i was your age again. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:14:51
Yup. Just like i remember the 100's of insane predictions posted here about 30k coins by 2016 and what not. 
It goes both ways. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:27:55
I doubt your post will get many upvotes. 
You are completely right though. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:58:01
No. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:27:49
Not denying that. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 01:34:43
How will they preserve it? What do you mean?
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:17:17
Why would anybody here be able to answer that??
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:21:12
So nothing then? Just some random accusations and then you dissapear?
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:48:08
Which pretty much no one expect people 1 or 2 countries have to worry about as you are fully aware of. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:26:16
With every one of these posts i'm closer to the sell button. Too many 2013 peak vibes. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:53:37
Chinese bots on exchanges with highly inflated numbers followed by euphoric westerners with gold fever. Pretty much. 
Edit. Oh shit, downvoteeees. 
Ignore the above post. Obviously this is caused by crazy user adoption around the world! Everybody wants in! What else could it possibly be!
@_date: 2016-12-23 09:00:41


And instantly downvoted. Post after euphoric post how China is reaching new highs but don't actually mention that China is pumping because then you get downvoted to hell. 
This sub....crazy. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 19:46:50
"This time it's different"
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:30:13
You're are absolutely not wrong, just very few here will admit that. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:06:43
Lamborghini Aventador?
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:56:38
What do i need to prove exactly? That the Chinese are leading this rally? Seriously?
That the Bitcoin market in Venezuela and India is extremely small??
@_date: 2016-12-18 11:56:54
You responded with the wrong nick. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 12:16:06
Because more people are buying. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:00:58
As i mentioned before i really love to spend way too much on Steam. Can't stop buying. It just works so smooth and fast. 
I wish more places accepted Bitcoin like they do.  
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:34:08
Every time you buy a coin a puppy is saved. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:56:26
Amazing how this questions keeps getting asked. Why do you people think anyone here can look into the future?
@_date: 2016-12-18 21:04:17
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:24:14
How would Bitcoin be a solution exactly? I honestly can't figure it out. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:40:01


So am i and everyone else here. Can we stop playing this stupid game about saving the world now?
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:14:44
The only thing i'm doing is posting counter points to ridiculous theories and often simply delusional views about user adoption and Bitcoin in general. Which i'm free to do in a Bitcoin sub as a Bitcoin owner. 
Fact is just by being not 100% positive about Bitcoin i get harassed, called a troll, downvoted, reported and a while back even threatened through PM. You should be disgusted by this behavior instead of attacking me as well. 
I'm not doing anything wrong. Nowhere in the sidebar rules does it say that your posts can only be positive. 
Hell, i'm pretty sure i even support the Bitcoin infrastructure more than 99% of the people here. 
I spent 1000's over the years in Bitcoin on stuff. Unlike the people here who call me a troll. They all "hodl" waiting to get rich and expect others to spend their coins. 
Yeah, thanks for the support guys. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:12:34
No. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:19:01
Your capslock seems broken?
@_date: 2016-12-18 22:29:34
Of what thing?
@_date: 2016-12-18 11:09:03
I'm sure they will be in this thread any time now to give you your answer. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:11:51
No. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:41:40
Indeed. Pump pump pump until euphoria overload and then the crash. And everyone will be so confused! 
How did this happen??? How is this possible?? The price was supposed to go up and up! I was told this time it was really happening???
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:56:04
Everybody is sending coins to Africa, Venezuela and some other poor countries to help feed the poor locals. 
Oh wait nobody is. Everybody is "hodling" waiting to get rich. 
They just want people in those poor countries to buy coins so the price goes up. 
So i guess the answer is hodl!
I personally actually spend my coins by the way. Yes, crazy i know. 
Edit. Downvote those inconvenient facts away guys! Like it doesn't exist!
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:51:39
My grandma in Greece invested her live savings in Bitcoin when this sub told her to buy buy buy in 2013. 
She got in at 1230 dollars and now is holding that sign in the left picture. Poor grandma! SFHL!
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:16:09
Ok thanks. This used to be different right?
Edit: my last posts stopped showing up suddenly. This has the be the result of something. Could the downvote campaign against me have triggered that?
@_date: 2016-12-20 15:05:39
This is the scammer you are talking to. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:15:17
I'm guessing Satoshi will be found again. 
And if all else fails then we can expect China to ban Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:16:50
I don't know right now but looking at the trades it's quite easy to identify bots. 
Bots are on all the exchanges though.

Edgy as hell. 
Please tell me you're not older than 16?

Where does this pull its data from? If from Chinese exchanges then it's worthless. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 01:29:37
Blah blah i don't like facts blah blah. 
Anyway, create an online wallet, send a coin to it, and give them the login. Let me know how it goes and how it will solve their problems. 
You are gonna do this, right? Or are you just an ideas guy and want others to do it?

But why? I thought we were here to save poor Africans and Venezuelans and make the world a better place. Why does the price need to go up for that?
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:42:19
A known troll?
What? Can you show me 1 troll post??
Pushing the price down? Again, what? I own a shitload of coins. Why would i possibly want the price to go down?
Can you show me, just one fucking post where i am trying to push the price down! Should be easy as i'm doing nothing else according to you. 
Just one you lunatic clown!
Can the mods do something about these ridiculous attacks? I want to be able to post here without these crazy accusations!
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:21:14
Just stop it man. The fake numbers in the Chinese exchanges is common knowledge. It's so old already. Everyone knows this!
It's not even a discussion anymore. 
There is one and only one reason you are calling it a conspiracy and refuse to admit it. Because it's a fact you don't like. That's all. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:25:04
Ok.

Bank account user not affected!

I worded that wrong. I'm not denying weak hands exist. Just that in the Bitcoin world anybody who doesn't "hodl" is considered a weak hand. Selling coins for mad profit? Weak hand! Selling and buying back? Weak hand! Spending you coins? weak hand!

No mention of any numbers or users. Useless clickbait article. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:36:41
Dude, ath is 1200 something. Calm down. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:44:59
Thank you. You just reminded me to order some drugs before christmas. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:07:21
I'm pretty sure there is no one who thinks a system that requires a fee with every single transaction will go mainstream. That would just be delusional. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:15:39


Not really. Actually i see quite some people here who are completely clueless and delusional about investing and currencies. More so than other random places. A bit more people with above average 
Math knowledge though. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:56:50
Every coin you are not personally invested in is. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:51:42


Yes, but they aren't. I don't care about what is possible. I care about what is actually happening. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:18:29
Wth are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:56:56
The Indian bitcoin market is so ridiculously small that i doubt it would raise the price by even 1 dollar. Stop being so easily influenced by the same bs India pump articles posted here 50 times a day. 
Bitcoin is not happening in India. It simply is not. 
And fund managers? What you mean with that exactly?
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:51:43
So i was right? Wow, your post is just weird. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:34:55
No thanks. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:10:38
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:03:07
How is that great news?
@_date: 2016-12-10 12:48:15
I truly can't believe people fall for these obvious scams. 
I do do know though that if i was a scammer i would target Bitcoiners. They just seem to throw money at every scam they can find. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 11:27:30
The only important post here isn't upvoted to the top. I wonder why. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:33:38
Look i understand where you are coming from but that doesn't explain a sudden price rise the last few days. Things like that don't suddenly happen like that. 
Everything at this moment points at the Chinese exchanges going crazy with inflated numbers and others following it. Nothing else in the last few days fundamentally changed. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 12:03:26
Why are you harassing me?

And everyone will magically move to Bitcoin and you will be rich!!

I answered you but for some reason the post doesn't show up. Click my username to read it. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 10:57:38
Who is gonna answer this you think?
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:38:49
Ah ok. You convinced me with that amazing logic. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:57:49
Why? What do you know that we don't?
