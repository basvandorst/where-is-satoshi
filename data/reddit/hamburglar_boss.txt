Moderation is a job of moderators.
What we're talking about is the OP's ability to censor posts, which is particularly destructive in the gambling section. If someone visits a casino thread, they should see posts that provide evidence of foul play. But with the current system, those posts are trivially deleted.
Bitcointalk's gambling section hosts the definitive thread of many bitcoin casinos. OPs should not be able to censor posts for the same reason businesses shouldn't be able to delete bad reviews on Yelp.

I personally use:
- [Breadwallet]( (iOS) as my offline wallet
- [Moneypot.com]( cold addresses as my mixer (which I then immediately send to Breadwallet once I receive money at my cold addresses)
Pretty common setup I learned about here on The general rule of thumb is to not use an online service as your main wallet - just use them for ancillary services and then move the bitcoin back into your wallet.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:43:36
I didn't downvote you, but there's no need to put "all your bitcoins" into these kinds of services, just like ShapeShift. I make a cold address to accept payment, then send it to my wallet (Breadwallet atm) after one confirmation (~10 minutes). Not exactly the riskiest thing you can do in a life.
If you're putting all your bitcoin into centralized services, you need to stop doing that.

- Or send money from your own wallet ( 
- Or tumble through a cold address first (
- Or do anything but send money to someone directly from Coinbase if you don't want Coinbase/recipient to know.
People keep using Coinbase as a wallet instead of just a convenient way to buy/sell bitcoin and that's the problem.

API services are good since they'll help developers build things faster. We've got [Vaultoro]( for trading, [Moneypot]( for gambling, and obviously services like [Chain]( for more general bitcoin integration.

One problem is that on-chain casinos are bad experiences:
- You have to bet from your wallet instead of betting from a nice casino UI
- You have to wait for confirmations when people want instant feedback, not wait around for their 20-cent dice bet to go through
- You have to spend ~5 cents fees per bet. Wanna bet 20 cents? A dollar? Not very attractive.
So it's the off-chain casinos that raked up the profits of the on-chain casinos.
Case study is SatoshiDice which was one of the first dice casinos, and it was on-chain. It got eaten by the emergent off-chain dice sites which had much better UX. It's had a big overhaul to support the off-chain experience that people expect.
LuckyBit is the main casino (plinko) that's still on-chain that I can think of. There currently is not good off-chain analogue yet, but that's just a matter of time I'm sure.

Sure, sending an email is a good additional feature. But if I had to choose between the orangered envelope system and depending on email, I'd choose the envelope.
I don't even like attaching emails to my accounts if I don't have to.

I believe only the t2.micro is part of the free-tier.
So, to put it all in one comment, it seems like the best bet is to use a t2.small (or t2.medium) for the initial sync ($2 for 1-2 days) and then resize back to a (free) t2.micro to maintain the blockchain from there.

The levenshtein distance between Josh Garza and Jeff Garzik is way too small. I constantly get them confused. Poor Garza, er, Garzik. Wait, which one sucks again?

Xenforo is best of breed. It was developed by ex-vBulletin devs before the Internet Branding buyout which led to vB4 and now vB5. Now those are steaming piles of shit. I think the only way to compete with Xenforo is to try something new entirely since Xenforo brought the BBS-style paradigm to its near limit.
I actually agree - I would prefer to use Xenforo in many places I've seen Discourse. But I'm also used to that forum style. I give credit to the three devs that built Discourse as they're trying something new and I wouldn't call it shitty. For some reason the hate on the forum just seemed to sieve from the hate on btc.com itself when I don't think it deserves hate the same as btc.com does. But it might have been a misunderstanding.

I don't think you know what distribution means.

As long as people are going "aw, why did they give me a gift card for a place I don't even go to? I'd rather have cash...", then there's a cash market for giftcards. People will trade a $13 giftcard for $10 in cash no problem.
What makes it work with Bitcoin is that it's irreversible which removes an entire category of headache and fraud from transactions that don't need it.
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:08:28
Oh, right.
Did you know that on bitcointalk you can opt-in to creating a topic that allows you to silently delete people's posts? In the bitcointalk gambling forum too of all places? Hilariously bad.
Unfortunately all the hopeful competitors are just going to be people that want a slice of the pie and offer no improvement. is surprisingly good compared to most attempts at bitcoin communities.
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:16:18
Is it 100% far-fetched? Venezuela and Argentina are two examples of countries that show up on from time as potential places to use bitcoin to hold against the local currency (or its restrictions). 
Though probably often exaggerates the effect, perhaps it's not too sci-fi to ponder the possibility.

I think DaDice's reaction to this is most telling of all, even had they eventually provided the proof.

Unfortunately we're still in the renaissance of shitty products validating themselves with "b-b-but... bitcoin".
I had a laugh when I clicked a model and ended up on a thumbnail gallery.

That's what I use too.
I hope they finish their API docs soon.

Well, bitcointalk is the locus of many subcommunities like bitcoin gambling.
So yes, people cream over the idea of running their own. There's a lot of money in it, too.

I'd love to see  added to the list.

For $10/mo, you can run a full node on a `t2.micro` EC2 instance at  with 50gb storage (a number I came up with when I penciled it into the [calculator](
If you don't have have an AWS account, then you'll pay $0 for 12 months once you register.
I recommend downloading the blockchain bootstrap file though. It'll take the t2.micro a while to catch up otherwise. Once it's caught up, it's really fast since it is provisioned for burst workloads. But it takes constant CPU to catch up to the longest chain which isn't ideal for this sort of burst instance.
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:09:44
Tail your network logs. Your node could be polling for a large `inv` every 50 seconds.
Been a while since I looked at my own logs, so I don't have an intuition about what it could be, but that's where I'd start.
@_date: 2015-05-16 23:10:50
Agreed. I think a good solution would be to simply collapse delete posts.

Imagine if Reddit's envelope was replaced with an email. The idea of using another service just to know when someone replied to you is funny. It was "better than nothing" in the mid-2000s but I like to think the bar is a bit taller in 2015.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:57:06
Definitely. Starting from scratch is just too punctuated by the out-of-burst that micros have, and probably even with a 300k block bootstrap.
I would actually recommend to start with a t2.small or even a t2.medium and then, once full synced in a day or two, move the storage over to a t2.micro. A t2.small costs $20/mo, but it'll be prorated to, what, 2 days max? That's not even $2.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:38:05
No, it's not material design.
It's stock 
I'd rather use discourse over most forum software. It does super-advanced things like... notifying you when someone mentions/responds to you. Can't use a forum without that feature anymore.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:37:58
OP's just not "feeling" 6k.
@_date: 2015-05-14 01:54:15
Absolutely not the same.
Casino X has a canonical thread in the gambling subforum. It even shows up when you google "Casino X". People go there to keep up with the casino. It's where the conversation is happening.
If a vulnerability or scammy behavior was found with Casino X, then we should see it on page 39 where it's reported and the operators are forced to address it.
Making a separate forum topic gets little visibility, the operators aren't forced to address it, and once people stop bumping it, there's no indication in the canonical thread that it ever happened.
Sure, if someone is spamming your thread, then the moderators should do their job. But you shouldn't be able to censor your own thread. If bitcointalk has worthless moderators, then that's another discussion. People get censored all the time. It's actually hilarious that it's possible.

- Desktop: [Electrum](
- Mobile (Android): [Mycelium](
- For mixing received payments (when you need it), use [MoneyPot's cold addresses]( before transferring to Electrum/Mycelium.

Well, Rhavar is up there with Dooglus (just-dice) and Stunna (primedice) as far as people I trust in the bitcoin gambling community. Though I frequent bitcointalk so I actually see them interact with people.
That these guys went years without stealing their own bankroll makes them infinitely more trustworthy to me than, say, [mycelium]( crowdsale -- a company that doesn't even make money... until the millions they made on their crowdsale. :)

I'm pretty sure their experiment predates moneypot seeing that dice.ninja is on their list. Though speaking of moneypot, they interestingly diverted their personal commission to investors when investor profit dropped last week. I'd like to see the experiment run again with moneypot included.
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:51:24
Not really. If it's so trivial to create a 30 day backlog then it's prudent to solve the issue ASAP because that's a problem with bitcoin. 
Actions speak louder than words, and creating the backlog shows how much of an issue it is.
Hoping that a bad actor doesn't trivially spam the network (the current solution as we speak) is not a scalable solution.
@_date: 2015-08-31 09:17:59
Probably comes from the cold hard forge of reality.
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:05:58
This is why I use Moneypot.com cold addresses.
It's trivial to get around this issue, but the real problem is that people don't know til Coinbase hits them with that "we've noticed your gambling activity" message. Not much you can do since it's a broad awareness issue.

It really doesn't. It's 1 cent.
