Thanks for the link, I will read about it.  How does this address the problem of "If everyone decides what they believe is able to override the communal laws then how do we enforce individual rights?

And even if the result for us bitcoin owners was good... The political ramifications would be terrible.  Bitcoin would be known as a criminal thing and eventually laws passed to reign it in.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:58:29
I am so proud I didn't panic sell.  I really have a lot of confidence in bitcoin.  To me it is without a doubt the way of the future.  The only concern is if there is a game braking flew yet to be exploited.  Or governments criminalise it.
@_date: 2014-01-17 11:19:01
FYI I did not downvote you, I hope that people do not because I am enjoying the conversations I have found on Could we look at historical instances of private security, such as mercenaries in the middle ages, as an example?  Becuase there is lots of abuse, and terrible things about that.  Most importantly, is that only the wealthy could afford them.

Bitcoin newb here... Doesn't this make sense? Whether we agree with it or not many things sold on the silk road were illegal.  Don't they have a right to enforce the laws? Not that I agree that things like pot should be illegal... But my opinion doesn't override the republic..

I understand.  It is frustrating.  You want to get in and start buying.  The reality is, everyone had to do the same steps.  Getting "into" the market is not instant.

As a long term bitcoin investor not really interested in buying and selling 50 times a day:
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:26:26
Oh then I misunderstood.  Residency is very important.  You can only be a resident of one country.  For example I am a us citizen but a resident of another country
If I make income in the other country.  They compare the taxes I pay there with the taxes in the USA and I need to pay any less taxes to the us.  Since the country I live in has higher taxes I pay nothing.  I do not agree with this model and wish it was not so.
However if I am a US resident and I made money somehow in another country.  I feel that these taxes should apply.  Its often easy to avoid them but I think the country of residence is where you should pay taxes no matter where the money is made.  Or else people would have their payroll companies in other countries and move lots of money outside and it would be bad for almost any country with any taxation.

@_date: 2013-12-05 12:08:33
Well, right now its both a currency and a commodity.  I can buy things with it, but I can also invest in it.
Currencies don't often rise and fall as much as bitcoin has in the past few years.  They are usually a bit more reliable.
If a month ago I paid 1 bitcoin for a lunch, and today I paid the same, I would be paying drastically different values.
If 10 years ago I paid $10 for a lunch and today I did the same. It is not very drastic difference in value.

Why isnt there a western country doing something like this?
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:11:47


Yes but we all have a say in the laws.  You want something changed go try to do it.  I agree with this example but that is the price we pay for all the benefits.  Even if we got rid of government there would still be people enforcing things with or without right to.


That is your choice.  You can stay here in the democracy or not.  I don't care.  But if you love your home so much... Well a democracy is what made it that.  If you don't like it then you have to try to change it or move.  But most mature people laugh at this opinion rightly so.


We do in every single country.  If you want something different you go.


Its not about morality.  Because my morality says that's not true.


They get better all the time, but they also have lots of problems.  USA in particular. 


Yes you are and that's democracy.  But I am nor forcing you to have the same opinion.  You can have any opinion you want and you can try to change the laws.  But you still should abide by them.
Its not a perfect form of government but it's the best that has been found.  Anarchy has had poor results so that's why I am against it.
Feel free to try to change it.  But just because you don't like something doesn't give you a moral or legal right to not listen to it. Its of course complicated but the gist of it is there.  Go somewhere else otherwise you have inherited the flaws of our forbearers and there's bad and good.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:18:18
Primary interest is truth and understanding.  Thats pretty bold comment.  I mean I would say I am also interested in Truth and Understanding myself, but if I told someone it was my primary interest, I would expect some remarkable knowledge from you.
So I would ask, in your search for understanding and truth, what is the most remarkable thing you have found?
Personally, I think the most remarkable thing I have found is the list of fallacies.  While it seems like a strange thing to note as the "most remarkable" the fallacies give us an understanding of what it is to be human that most things cannot.  It shows us our flaws and how we can be manipulated.  It allows us to re-evaluate our beliefs from another perspective which seems to be so hard to do alone.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:54:08
Markets hint... yes.
MtGox just went under 1000 again
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:48:12
I totally agree with you.  There are two ways to make money with bitcoin.  Long term is just buying a few here and there, and waiting it out.
Short term you can play the risky game, buy and sell here and there.  You may win you may lose.
Either are perfectly valid options.  But Bitcoins are not done rising.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:59:52
I suspect that throughout the day there will be quite a few inflammatory articles.
Be careful with buying or selling today. Most people probably aren't using reddit and getting comments on the articals they read.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:32:16
Untruths are lies. So if you are saying that the list is focusing on lies, I do not agree.  Fallacies exist, and recognizing their existance does not mean we are focusing on lies.
Can you elaborate on your truths?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:18:13
No you speculated. You did not know.
Here is the thing, say "it will go up" or "it will go down" is not interesting at all.  You think because you said something 4 times that its interesting? No.
If you told me"It will go up until 11:05 to $1300 today then down to $800 at 1230" then you would be providing help.
Right now we are watching a wave and you say "it will go down" and between you saying that, it goes up then down then up then down... and you think you are clever?
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:22:35
Standard circle jerking on reddit is expected.  We all want bitcoin to go up in value but the assumptions you are making and conclusion are something masters and PhD owners argue about and have all sorts of specific theories being debated.  You are just not qualified to make this claim. 
The only reason this is up voted is because people want others to buy...
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:14:29
Because you don't know.
We get a thousand people claiming this or that.  The reality is its all speculation... Just because one person was bound to be right (slightly) doesn't mean its going to be right in 10 minutes, a day or a week.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:11:35
If it is any help, after the first coin is bought (and confirmed through coinbase) you can then purchase multiple coins.
Today I did a few small transactions, so once the first hump is over then you will be better off.
One thing to remember, don't get caught up in the minute by minute/hour by hour events.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:05:16
Just a little disclaimer, while I suspect my chance of getting the bitcoin was pretty slim, I won't hold back my thoughts at risk of losing it completely...
Regarding infinity, I understand it just fine without relating it to trees or prime numbers.  Is there something about those two things that you believe reveals a truth that, say, a cat tail relating to infinity does not?
Regarding unlimited understanding.  I wanted to ask if you could clarify more.  Does this mean you understand everything, that you are capable of understanding everything or something else?
It sounds a little bit like [Woo-Woo](  Not trying to be insulting, but I am being sincere.  It sounds like just stringing words together without really giving a meaning or purpose to what is being said.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:39:31
If you are saying the us is the only country that doesn't let its citizens open bank accounts in other countries in order to not pay taxes then you are wrong.  That is what we were talking about

In order to ask a good question, we could use some more info.  What are your interests, where do you live, what do you enjoy about life?
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:03:13
True :)  Of course we have seen in the past the same things.  I really am not trying to circle jerk.  Bitcoins have continued to grow and there is no reason to believe this fall is special
And naturally before you even look at this it will probably be back up, and on its way down again...
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:41:08
Well considering there are already countries that recognize it as a currency or commodity, I would say this is not true.
We COULD see it banned in some countries.  But it's hard to speculate.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:11:49
Yes we care what governments think.  This idea that "they" are destroying the world is immature.
Governments are just a group of people.  The authority held by a government is just because the people give it that authority.
Remember the quote by GRRM about this? 
“In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it,’ says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it,’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do it,’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’ So tell me—who lives and who dies?”
Governments arent destroying the world, people area.  Bitcoin will not save the world because it doesn't change people.  It does, however, present a new alternative and there are many ways this can make the world better... but it also has a dark side as it allows illegal activities (the really bad ones) to go about in a less-traceable way.  I like the direction Bitcoins are going, but its not gonna change people.
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:13:55


You have a say but also you can be out ruled.  I don't care about ruling by individual consent.  Just consent of the majority.  But that is besides the point.


No I don't.  You can stay at your home in this land and under this government.  There is no one forcing you.  Just like you were born into the democracy you also were born into this home.  If you don't consent to the government but consent to the home then that's a little hypocritical since you chanced both. 


Where I live. I get high wages. Businesses have security as well as individuals since everyone has to comply with the laws.  I get 1 year of paternity leave when I have a kid.  I have a national and private health system that provides fantastic basic and comprehensive coverage.  Almost every other country is cheap to vacation to. I have 25 days of vacation minimum each year.  Unemployment is hovering at 3%.  I would say life is pretty damn good.  


You can say whatever you want is evil but if you really didn't like it you would leave it.  Your choice to stay is consent. There are many other options and just because you chance to be born here doesn't mean you have some magical immunity to the laws.  Feel free to try to change it and if you don't follow the laws you will unfortunately end up in jail which unfortunately again is brutal and nasty in the USA.


I don't live in the USA.  As I said before.  But yes things are getting better.  We also have things that get worse.  But overall people are safer and live better lives.  Not on a day to day comparison but the world as a whole.


Yes because as a community we decided you do not have the right to live your life as you see fit
  In many many ways you do. But not completely.  Your choice to stay here is your decision that its worth it.


Okay you can work for that.  Most of the us does not think that.  Sorry : /


No but partially true for the US.  Historically might is right.  We are barely getting past that in some countries.  


Partly true I have never seen it in experience.  Just like you haven't experienced most other countries on earth and their forms of government.  But we have lots of information about older societies.  It is likely that an internet and also a bitcoin could not exist in that world.


Okay doesn't bother me :) likely you end up in jail and that will be really bad for you.... So I recommend not doing this.  


Okay.  I have no problem with that.  Our form of government permits this and i think it's good to have a variety of views.  I think you are mislead and probably never have experienced any other country on earth.  So I think you should try to get a couple years out in the works and a few countries before you destroy your life for something.

@_date: 2013-12-23 23:33:05
Well yeah but every modern successful country does this.  If not people would all do what the parent poster was asking about and societies would function terribly
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:16:01
I agree and don't like that.  But we were not talking about that.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:42:40
No I'm not forcing my opinion but yes I do like enforcing laws.  If you want to go somewhere without government or a weak government feel free.  I do not.  I love that communities and governments exist.  Though I hate most implementations... I do recognize their value.  I think its better to improve them than throw them out completely.
If you think that enforcing laws is wrong that's fine.  You are an idiot IMO and we have nothing to talk about. Yeah I don't enjoy a lot of laws but I value enforcing the laws and prefer to improve the societies than abandoning them.
Essentially I believe in democracy and you do not.  That's fine but you don't get the option of living in a democracy and not be a part of it.
The number one ranked country in the world is strongly socialist and I love living here. I hope you get some more experience and broaden the countries you have lived in so you can get a better opinion.

@_date: 2013-12-23 23:41:48
Agree to disagree.  The countries doing the best in the world have strong governments.  Historically weak governments usually meant hard times for most of the people. 
But this is besides the point and sidesteps the specific issue with a general statement.

What? I am not forcing the opinion on anyone.  But yes a country has the right to enforce laws whether or not individuals agree.
And my opinion is not irrelevant to the conversation since the whole point of reedit is comments and discussion.  Otherwise it works both ways and both or opinions are irrelevant which makes reddit boring

When you know how the make these graphs, you can see why the last curve is not going to be correct.
The further you zoom out, the more information it condenses into one point.  For today, we dont know the "end of the day" weighted average.  So it just puts the "so far" weighted average.
Many other days had the same, but its lost as the market continued to shift.
