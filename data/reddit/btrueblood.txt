This is going to be a great event! Looking forward to it. Happy to be among the great sponsors.

Similar situation happened to my fiancee this weekend except it was a processing issue on Overstock's end. Had to make call to Overstock's customer service payment team (regular customer service had no clue) but original amount of BTC sent was refunded in about an hour.

The UFC has some control over what sponsors the fighters represent in the octagon (I believe unless it has changed). I believe there might also be an fee that goes to the UFC to be a sponsor. Just something to think about....I'm still on board though!

Good to see Big Law get on board; surprisingly early actually. Big Law is traditionally one of the slowest market segments to adopt/embrace new technologies. Smart move. Not sure if we are "major" but we've been in the space for a while:

PayPal must embrace Bitcoin; or it will die. They have realized this

Nice. Hadn't heard about your listing. Just submitted our info
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:25:55
nice job as always!

The bigger the law firm, the harder it is to get new ideas like accepting Bitcoin (when most of the partners know nothing about it) past the executive committees. You would really need to have a push from Clients to accept BTC. However, if there is money to be made we attorneys are sure to follow...

While its clearly attention seeking, public displays like this are excellent to show the uninformed how quick and easy its is to instantly send money to anyone in the world w/ Bitcoin.

Thank you!

FWIW, I've personally met the guys from Trucoin at our Fort Lauderdale Bitcoin meetup. They are real and have an office in Avenutura, FL. Nice guys. Wish them well on this project. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:30:22
Thank you sir. Talk soon. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:20:35
Thank you for the response. Much appreciated. I believe we are both in Broward County, FL. Is that correct? I remember seeing you on coinmap. My lawfirm is Mearkle Trueblood Adam. We should link up. I'm at the Broward meet up just about every week.

What if Bitstamp is shut down before the end of the bet?
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:03:03
Should be a great event. Looking forward to it

This is especially true when it comes to merchant adoption. The better course is to explain it as a payment platform rather than a "currency". Of course, we all like the other stuff. But you have to set the hook before pull the line.

You dont have to use this multi sig feature. Their original wallet feature is still live

If we do end up doing this, he would be a great choice. Always a fan favorite and he has a background in Computer Science.

Here's a little more about this: 
Maybe Rogan could help with the fees? Additionally there are other promotions, while not as visible as the UFC would be much easier to get into - World Series of Fighting and Bellator. UFC would be first choice obviously, but if we wanted to do this in a different promotion, I have access to several of those fighters here in Florida.

Awesome. Tell them to get involved with the local meet up groups. They will definitely get business 
@_date: 2016-01-11 21:40:07
Good job guys. Looks good!

I just don't get the Coinbase hate (from legit non-trolls). I've never had any customer service issues with them whatsoever. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:13:08
You're kidding right?
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:08:15
Great explanation of a sound business decision and position.

The forensic analysis of the white paper was pretty clear that he at least wrote the white paper. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 20:23:00
Just ordered. Good luck!

Bitcoin or not, I dont know how you couldn't like this movie. I thought it was one of the best of the year so far.
