Fair enough. Most people find it hard to do that but if you must, the simplest thing is just to ask yourself whether you can live normally if you lose the investments 100% tomorrow.

1) Should've not bought Bitcoin with your savings
2) Should've not bought Bitcoin with your savings
3) Should've not bought Bitcoin with your savings
Before you can even think to invest/speculate/trade in any market, you need to have
1) All your bills paid off
2) Your rainy day emergency funds available for 3-4 months worth of expenses
The first question you should ask yourself before you enter any market including Crypto is "if I lose 100% of this money tomorrow, can I still pay my bills and pay for any emergency expenses". If the answer is no then you should not be dabbling in the market.

Good man! :)

That's normal.

Sorry about your loss. Hope you and your family can be strong in this time of need.
First thing first. Do not tell anyone the information in that paper and the 5 digit number.
Can you confirm what's written on the thumbdrive device? Is it Ledger? It sounds to me like a Ledger Nano S device. If so, I happen to have one and I can help walk you through it. Their website is  for more information and your reference.
Remember, do not tell anyone anything on the paper.

Your type is why people think everyone owning bitcoin is crazy.
1) You don't know other people's life. Andreas did not buy BTC years ago because he has other obligation that prevented him. Is he stupid? No. It's called life.
Just as you shouldn't be investing if you have other more pressing obligations that you should take care of, you shouldn't be buying coins or hodl-ing if you have other more pressing obligations.
2) What the fuck is all or nothing?
Is all = eating ramen the rest of your life so you can have "wealth" built up for when you die? Everyone's "moon" is different. There's another guy who sold to buy house. That's his moon. Someone else sold to buy a car. That's his moon.
You have to define what your "moon" is. Maybe for you, eating ramen the rest of your life is fine but for others it's probably not.
Fuck off and stop telling people what to do.

Are you sure that increasing personal wealth by taking it from others is sub-obtimal for society? After all, aren't we all on the a-hole spectrum?
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:05:09
No that's not what I meant at all but I am asking if instead of having a fair trade, we should actually engage in an unfair trade where one party has all the advantages and instead of expanding the wealth pie overall, we just take it from other people and expand our OWN personal wealth.
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:07:27
Perhaps the best trades are ones where the other party does not know they have their wealth reduced. Financial exploitation at its best.

Do you really believe that moving away from fiat currency to some sort of crypto-currency or gold backed currency system will actually "grow" the economy?
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:29:13
Having said that, have you ever considered being part of said groups you mentioned and benefits yourself at the expense of everybody?
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:33:06
Your statement is very unfortunate as you're implying that the mainstream knowledge is inferior than *your* interpretation of how the "system" works.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:36:40
Ah Bitcoin. The pinnacle of human currency and ingenuity. The most important invention since the fire and wheel. 
That silly "coin" of yours will cease to exist long before Reddit stopped being relevant. In fact, your coins will cease to exist long before ANYTHING stopped being relevant.

Yeah okay fuck you. After all these months **now** you want to keep the community together.

Scroll down from ledgerwallet.com and find the link to the actual Ledger company it'll direct you to Ledger.fr.

They make the market, though. Literally the definition of market.
Without people like them, you can't buy at the dip.
