not only that, it would be very easy to identify the person who bought 1m btc
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:18:25
I like the creator of Bitcoin, Dr Craig Wright. and thank him for creating bitcoin
not really, hes a cunt
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:44:27
Do you even know yours were taken?
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:23:54
I had trouble with my 2FA on kraken and it wasnt allowing me to login. I emailed them and they said this:
"We have an issue on our end with Yubikey Authentication at the moment, I have reported it to one of our developers. We will provide you with an update as soon as the issue is resolved"
@_date: 2016-08-12 17:05:24
It must be horrible for him. I just dont understand how he thought he could get away with lying to one of the smartest and skeptical group on people on the planet
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:41:47
sucks man, im really sorry to hear that.. really bad
I hope you feel better in the coming weeks/months
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:19:34
im just being realistic, i think its going to climb slowly
Bubbles are hard to form when everyone knows they are bubbles
@_date: 2016-04-17 13:25:23
Thats true, but in all fairness the price at the last halvening was around $10, so people were about to buy a shit load for little cost. its around 45x higher now
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:17:08
Long time bitcoin holder here... im saying $700 - $900
Bored now after 4 years.. wow.. I just said it
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:55:30
yeah you should definitely do it. Dont bother with the GPU tho, CPU is fast enough
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:14:47
I honestly feel he will be vindicated and we will have a solid fast system with smaller blocks. Small blocks are beautiful, just need to find ways to make it work
@_date: 2016-04-06 16:27:46
Sure but LN fees are pretty much negligible so merchants could give 2% discounts to pay by LN.
With regards to chargebacks there could be 3rd party counterparties that offer this service and undercut visa.
and lets face it, for 99% of transactions you will never be requiring a charge-backs.
That all said, I was referring to the through put of the network rather than the service CC's offer
@_date: 2016-04-22 10:37:21
Also it was a nice test for recovery
@_date: 2016-04-24 13:24:34
Just me lol
@_date: 2016-04-24 13:26:06
@_date: 2016-04-04 21:18:41
But there are mods
@_date: 2016-04-25 20:57:49
Holy shit!
@_date: 2016-04-05 15:14:28
“A single node on a reasonably fast internet connection will be able to process thousands of transactions per second. In aggregate across the entire network, the total capacity will be in the millions per second, even early on.”
Your move visa..
@_date: 2016-04-04 20:14:04
They need to implement a way for mods to validate a store before it goes live. Every new user is opening a store and its drowning out the real stores
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:23:28
if indeed OP is correct with the address, its highly unlikely that his hash is also a bitcoin address. 
I mean what are the chances? pretty much impossible no?
@_date: 2016-04-10 18:21:43
pretty sure all those wallets will have seamless LN channels within the wallet eventually
@_date: 2016-04-05 08:25:58
Thats a good idea. also there should be a place for new stores like app stores
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:59:54
everyone knows thats not true simply because of "the halvening"
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:24:13
uh oh, this guy is about to change shit forever
@_date: 2016-04-11 10:12:33
Such a great job on this. In a few years time I can see this project being pretty major.
Well done for keeping it current
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:41:52
Because you have to abide by the terms of service of the centralised marketplace. OB is ungoverned
@_date: 2016-04-18 09:44:44
Actually I did suggest "proof of kill" a few years ago as a concept
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:11:04
Not really, the market is still decentralised and distributed. If someone wants to create a nice web based interface to it, I dont think compromises the advantages.
@_date: 2016-04-18 10:11:06
Oh I didnt, it was just a concept. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:11:59
There needs to be a chrome app with a light client
@_date: 2016-04-04 20:24:45
Visit my store, im selling bitcoin
@_date: 2016-04-17 22:32:15
Are you ok? do you need to use the toilet or something?
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:01:42
$30k next target
@_date: 2016-04-17 19:57:08
Hey this guys trying to get us to stop talking about the bubble. Get Him!
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:03:50
And short squeezes
@_date: 2016-04-10 18:23:31
exactly, the term vapor ware seems to have taken on a new means in the bitcoin community
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:57:53
I managed to get my girlfriend to contribute £10k to our BTC stash!
shes loves the shit out of it
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:05:26
Ethereum will be fine, but I cant see people wanting to keep DAO
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:16:27
bad advise, go get a job, earn some money and find a way to aquire. what this guy is suggesting is defeatist loser talk
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:58:56
Peter Schiff knows nothing of the HODL
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:34:48
I agree, Ethereum isnt doomed, but you have to admit that bitcoin never had a fundamental flaw.
None the less, Ethereum awaits 2 years of hell
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:55:50
it wont get returned because it didnt go anywhere
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:14:57
yes what he said. you can get more bitcoin by buying. dont stress out gambling it.. just BUY MOAR!
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:16:26
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:51:40
ITS PRICED IN!!!!!
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:14:29
what is the optimisation % in the tests, I couldnt find it
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:01:47
Yes, send it to zero
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:22:06
Two satoshi's, one was Wong, and the other was Wright
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:39:20
cut her some Slock
@_date: 2016-06-21 09:17:19
Your battery is as drained as The DAO
@_date: 2016-06-20 19:41:46
Yeah wonder why he didnt correct that point. hmmmmmmm
@_date: 2016-06-25 08:48:03
or the previous price and % drop
@_date: 2016-06-24 20:33:13
your meme is bad, and you should feel bad
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:21:08
Can everyone stop being sad!
@_date: 2016-06-22 08:47:24
dumbest guys in crypto? you kidding?
@_date: 2016-06-17 11:30:35
Set them back? its over
@_date: 2016-09-07 11:19:59
Yeah it was terrible, I winced whilst watching it.
It was basically this all the way through
@_date: 2016-09-29 11:39:11
use localbitcoins when paying for your coffee at starbucks?
@_date: 2016-09-29 14:13:33
1. its not mine, check my history
2. its highly related, its a decentralized network. If bitcoin is to become ultimate money then it needs to withstand situations where the internet is not available. youre the only person in this thread that thinks its unrelated
@_date: 2016-09-06 14:13:48
I think its both and neither. It just needs to be easier and more integrated with real life... 30 years should do it ;)
@_date: 2016-09-06 14:02:45
Because its hard to understand, it gets bad press and the masses dont understand why they need it yet.
@_date: 2016-09-23 10:40:32
agreed. just being a dick
@_date: 2016-09-20 16:49:58
hahahah she doesnt know shit, you can see it in her eyes
@_date: 2016-09-28 21:54:21
well you are, OP isnt.
HE AINT GOT SHIT!
@_date: 2016-09-20 16:45:19
You might be joking about the mountains but I hear this more and more and more.. I feel exactly the same way. unplug that shit (apart from my trezor)
@_date: 2016-09-26 15:47:25
* "creates" surely? :)
and corrected
@_date: 2016-09-22 18:53:37
Bad luck
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:12:45
im going with twat too
@_date: 2016-09-06 13:04:28
idiotic statement. Technology adoption moves faster and faster as everything gets cheaper, more accessible, accepted, easier to build, easier to understand (better UX technology)
you cant just say it takes 30 years. pokemen go went supernova in 2 fucking days
@_date: 2016-09-28 21:55:43
Maybe im just stoned, but I endorse this message
@_date: 2016-10-01 18:13:26
sure, but you get my point.. the UI in Brave is a step backwards
@_date: 2016-10-01 13:45:37
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:49:27
Bloody Peasant! 
@_date: 2016-10-18 17:53:15
unless bitty
@_date: 2016-10-11 21:22:17
waaaaa? you can't buy it with bitcoin??
@_date: 2016-10-05 16:12:33
@_date: 2016-10-05 17:06:14
Ill take your word for it
on a side note: Ad hominem is one of the most over used fallacies on this subredit
@_date: 2016-10-01 13:45:19
The browser interface is really shitty, they need to fork chrome. 
@_date: 2016-10-01 14:56:08
The rendering engine seems to work well. but the UI puts it back 5 years or more. I dont think anyone can expect to make such a sacrifice. As someone said above, a plugin would be much better
@_date: 2016-10-05 17:11:05
OMG absolute Ad hominem attack on Mike Maloney!
such an Ad hominem!!
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:58:56
are you rapping?
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:21:27
Looks like the Gemini auctions are eating up the daily mining output of 1,800
I wonder how much of these are being re-sold on the exchanges
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:48:35


NEVER! the radiation would kill me!
@_date: 2016-05-26 19:58:15
she did? such freedom!
@_date: 2016-05-09 20:47:10
^ this
@_date: 2016-05-29 14:21:54
sure but then the bitcoin in circulation is under valued. the price is based on supply
@_date: 2016-10-05 16:19:28


Not really
@_date: 2016-05-08 19:27:09
Too many words, take 80% out and replace with simple bullet points, analogies and visuals. You're gonna melt their brains
@_date: 2016-05-09 19:21:40
he wants to tax remittances, so id say hes pretty bad for bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:01:11
^ this. stopped reading after that line
@_date: 2016-05-31 22:08:41
I actually lol'd hard at that
@_date: 2016-05-09 19:23:40
dust or bust
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:10:13
you have a copy of their private key, not the bitcoin
@_date: 2016-07-20 15:02:40
speak with coinfloor
