tell that to the rest of posters on @_date: 2015-01-17 00:37:14
look at the chart of bitcoin. it'll go back down to pre bubble price of $10. there are more coins now and the general public don't trust bitcoin anymore as an investment. maybe in 5 years it'll go back up to $300, but not until people have forgotten about all the negative press.
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:35:26

thats true. I know what you mean by the roller coaster ride. i think the people watching the price now are the ones that will catch it when its in the 90s then the general public will catch on.

@_date: 2015-01-14 16:40:43
the price is not crashing. Its been going down everyday for the last year and it'll keep going down till new people that have never heard of bitcoin come in. The value of a bitcoin is $15, so wait till it goes to $6-$10 to make a profit.

i wouldn't buy any coins for an investment. Use it to buy stuff within a week. if you hold onto it for too long its value will go down. Id invest into bitcoin when its below $50. just saying and watch the fanboys give me negative karma.

@_date: 2015-01-14 18:54:04
You could buy 30 bitcoins with that money in a few days.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:17:56
Think of the stupidest person you know. Imagine them in a country with no toilets or clean water, where the average daily income is less then a dollar a day and try to convince them they need a nokia phone to transfer their 10 cents across their village at the cost of a 30 cent text msg. Not going to happen

If they don't have money to build a toilet they won't have money to send via a phone. Phone masts are expensive too. Nice idea but won't work.

Im only here because I sold my bitcoin a few months ago and want to see the price crash to $50 or less so I can buy back in.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:33:39
Don't. There are not enough buyers to keep the price going up. Especially with Russia being out of the game now. Bitcoin is going to go down to $10. Look at the charts of all the shitcoins. Same pattern of human behaviour. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:49:06
so we can change the code of bitcoin then. no, so its old tech vs new shitcoins that claim to have new tech

@_date: 2015-01-15 03:51:08
all the people on the planet that are into computers or investing already know about bitcoin. You saw the bubble a year ago. to get your average mother to use bitcoin you first have to show her how to use internet then a smart phone to the level of geek. not going to happen. bitcoin is going to keep going down in value over the next year. then there may be a spike at block halving because the media will report on it.

Is the cost of the phone call or internet data charge added into this. Plus the cost to charge the phone to have the wallet available.

Done it. and good luck with your thesis. If its for a degree good luck with that and I recomend sending out emails with a list of questions to as many people in the industry as possible. you can then say you interviewed them.
