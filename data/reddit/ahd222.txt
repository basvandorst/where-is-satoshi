I have a strategy, we just need everyone to stop selling, and price will go up

I'll be in my bunk

Another way is when they reply they don't accept Bitcoin, stare them in the eyes and say "Statist whore..."  
Then walk away without paying. If the cashier does anything, yell "This. Is. Bitcoin!" and kick him in the guts  
  
Some people need to be physically awakened to the genius of Satoshi

What if I told you  
*puts on glasses*  
You won't have to sell at the end

That subset should be the majority, and it isn't. Because there's not enough democratic control over each decision. Don't tell me it's in the interest of the people. They said the same about slavery and colonialism. It's not a matter of interest.

It depends on the issue. But generally it should be our freedom to follow the opinion of more educated people, otherwise those who control education control everything. It's the same deal than for colonial enlightenment. They were forced to follow the values and religion from the more 'civilized', more 'educated', and it was not right. No, I will not agree that a person owning a piece of paper signed by another has more authority than a third without it. It is this third person's right to decide whether the paper has value, and to follow with its vote or not. Otherwise it's this old problem again of deciding who tells the worth of what... And people tend to be biased. When it can be gamed, it will be gamed. I agree with you, but to me, it is slightly utopian.
