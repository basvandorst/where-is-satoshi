Key points: 
1) Before offering any services other than consulting, NEO will upgrade its security to make sure all account are 100% safe
2) Many companies as well as individuals called NEO and are planning to accept BEE payments
3) The Economist knows a lot about Bitcoin, says it is awesome for transactions but awful for storage of value or accounting units
4) Usual BS like Money Laundering, Hackers etc.

The only problem I see with Havelock IMO is that they currently own too slow servers (they can't handle too much traffic, like now being a good example or when NEO first opened a few weeks ago). If they upgrade servers I would see no problem with keeping all my shares on Havelock.

Deutsche Bank (in Germany) AKA biggest bank in Europe called me in to their offices. First they were concerned about money laundering (regarding LocalBTC and Bitcoin.de transfers).  Once I explained that it was for Bitcoin they requested I email them all the receipts I had with the two websites in the last 3 months. Once I had proof that it was for Bitcoin, they relaxed...

LMB-Holdings guarantees the stocks. Even if something happens to Havelock, you will still have your stocks in tact. When Bitfunder and BTCTC were both taken down all stocks were safeguarded and transferred hustle-free to a new exchange.

Ok well if for example you have one blockchain.info account and you have 5 addresses having 1BTC each and you send 4.5BTC to one address, you will have 4 addresses sending 1BTC each and 1 address sending 0.5BTC so it mostly depends on how your Bitcoin are split between wallets. At the same time, if you are sending Bitcoin and you want to send 4.5BTC and share it between multiple addresses you can do that and the 4.5BTC will be split between different addresses. That is usually done to 'confuse' people so that no one can tell how much Bitcoin that one user really has

My personal predictions and market analysis: as long as the Bitcoin won't have intensive increases it will slowly start fluctuating up perhaps gaining around $10-$15 per month in value. Of course, if other countries collapse we'll have the Cyprus scenario all over again where the Bitcoin will explode and then fall while stabilizing at a significantly higher price then what it was before the explosion. Thoughts?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:40:12
Mr. Senator,
As far as illegal activities and money laundry goes, I do understand that it is in your constituent's best interest to stop any of those activities and while it is said that the Bitcoin contributes to it (silk road being the best example), even if there will be talk about regulating the Bitcoin then I would like to bring the following to your attention: the US dollar banknote is still the easiest and by far the most anonymous way to make illegal trading and if the Bitcoin does become regulated, other then the fact that it will hurt the Bitcoin it will also not do anything to reduce illegal activities as if people switched from the USD to the BTC to i.e. buy drugs, they can as easily switch back to the USD.
Moreover, regulating the Bitcoin will hurt it a lot but not only the Bitcoin community but also the body that is trying to regulate it as it will require a lot of time and effort and to have a big regulation over the BTC is next to impossible as due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of it.
Thank you for your time,
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:11:00

I don't think people understand what triggers a bubble.  A BTC is only as valuable as people say it's valuable and we control the price.
