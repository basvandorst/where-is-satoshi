So you won't accept the currently available evidence as proof until you get to see other evidence that is supposedly being suppressed?   What reason do you have to believe it even exists?

Yeah, I think you're wrong about that.

So why isn't there a purse.io that converts Amazon gift cards to cash (USD, EUR, whatever)?  Why bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:16:59
But again, why bitcoin only?

Ulbricht and his lawyers didn't even try do deny or refute the allegations. They tried to explain it away by claiming it was online role-playing. Also there's the whole matter of blockchain transactions for hundreds of thousands of dollars that correlate to the payments for the murders. 
Not that it will ever matter to @_date: 2016-02-24 23:18:27
What does that even mean?  What does bitcoin have to do with entrepreneurs thinking of a way to sell (supposedly) excess/unwanted Amazon credit?  They're two totally unrelated things.

It's almost like how credit cards will have a small fee to account for overhead from things like investigating fraudulent transactions.

The chat logs are there. The BTC transactions are public record. The defense did not contest the allegations during sentencing, and instead tried to downplay their severity. What would constitute proof to you?
