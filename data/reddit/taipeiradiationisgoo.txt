IT GOES UP!!
what it really is I dont know, might be tulips for my part
An interesting sidenote:
compared to shares, the potential is unlimited. you can wait out.
the "gamblers fallacy" doesnt play out with Bitcoin. it can go to zero, but the whole chain keeps on churning so it goes up
again, inevitably.
Not so with shares, if shares drop 70% they issue more shares (recap) and what you invested goes to zero and is rebased so will never relaunch with the same power you once had. If a share goes to zero it ENDS. that is a big difference

is it that highly speculative? it can go up or it can go down..seems like a 50% odds roughly estimated.
Highly speculative is whether we get visit from Aliens in 2018

either way we are all stupid :
or btc will get 1MUSD and we should be putting all our savings in it 
or btc will go to 0USD and we should step out or buy these short options
it will oscillate between the 2 so we will all be often proved as been very stupid
this is the case for holding 1 mBTC or owning 100BTC
