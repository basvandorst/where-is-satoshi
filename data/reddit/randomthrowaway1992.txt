so what exactly do those little things do?

So0o0o what happens when someone comes up with software that is able to either hack or over ride lock to homes. With a physical key lock, the only way. to gt in is to have a lock smith make a key, already have a key, or break a window or smash a door. The first two aside, an actual break in leaves evidence that some gained entree to your home. A lock on a home that uses this wifi key could be broken in with no evidence of the invasion. Technology is cool but it has it's major set backs.
