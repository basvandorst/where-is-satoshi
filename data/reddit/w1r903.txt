No, people will look it up if they're really interested.  This is an emotional appeal (and a very good one, at that).  No need to make it into an ad.
Maybe you could put a *brief* description of the conflict in the video's text description area (like the first paragraph from the above), but no more.

If the founder is reading, perhaps integrate a "sample Bitcoin payment process" or "how does this work" button right next to the pay with Bitcoin button?  You'd get more reliable statistics.

Have you taken a look at Armory?  Lots of people speak highly of its ability to manage offline wallets with ease.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:10:51
I agree.  If someone is storing enough coins on your hot wallet to wipe you out, they're not really understanding the concept of cold/hot wallets.

It'd be worth taking a look at trigger.io for a project like this.  If you've tried titanium or phonegap before for cross-platform Javascript apps and been disappointed at how slow it loads, you'll be amazed at the performance of trigger.io.  They've really done an amazing job.  And development is incredibly easy.  However, it's not an open platform, and it's a bit pricey.  But for a potentially expensive project like this one, it can be a money-saver.
Sadly, they don't accept payment in Bitcoin.  I know because I asked them.

If you do use bitcoin-otc for the first time, just be sure you *carefully* read: 
Be sure to verify the counterparty's identity using ;;ident &lt;nick&gt; command and also their rating on web of trust using ;;getrating &lt;nick&gt;  There are scammers on there who masquerade as trusted sellers/buyers.  Don't be fooled by an extra dash or period on someone's nick.
But yeah, there are sellers on there that could easily accommodate orders for over $10,000+ worth of btc on a given day.

If you're on Ubuntu or Linux Mint, you can also add the official Bitcoin Repo using 
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin 
As long as you check to make sure the the resulting output shows the right signing key id (8842CE5E), you're then safe to run apt-get update and apt-get install bitcoin-qt.  add-apt-repo essentially does everything described above automatically.
The Bitcoin ppa maintainer is Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin core dev.

Yes, and the same goes for the sourceforge repo, which is why the devs are super careful with key management.  I trust them to look after Bitcoin's best interests.  Most of the core devs are also big Bitcoin holders, so it's definitely in their best interest to do so.
However, the big money would be compromising the Windows build, not this one.  The percentage of people using the Linux builds is relatively small.

A cold wallet is a wallet that is physically separated from the Internet ("air-gapped" in the jargon of the trade), preferably on a computer or storage device (USB, etc.) that has never previously been connected to the Internet.  Paper wallets are also cold wallets, although I think people discussing paper wallets usually refer to them as such.

Just sent compensation.  Thank her for me, since I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.
@_date: 2013-04-29 01:02:33
Absolutely.  It bewilders my Windows-using friends when I tell them that I can leave a computer running with no reboot and no crashes or loss of performance for weeks, even months, at a time.  Usually, the only thing that takes my desktop computer offline these days is a power outage.
That, my friends, is engineering.

Just like to add that I've been smoothly buying/selling Bitcoins from campbx since 2011 with no problems.  I think a lot of people have been jumping on campbx recently, which has made trading slower, but there is a little more liquidity.  If you're trading less than 10-20 btc on a regular basis, there's plenty of liquidity at campbx.  A lot of it is in dark pools, so just because you don't see the liquidity doesn't mean it's not there.

Start a bounty.  If enough users are interested and chip in to the bounty, you may get some interest.  If I weren't already extremely busy, I'd do this myself using blockchain.info's receive payments API.  blockchain.info has some incredibly cool developer features that are way underused.

First article in a long time to approach Bitcoin from a factual, and non-sensationalist, manner.  One to keep for a long time to refer friends and family to.

Income tax is a *much* smaller tax on rich folks than on middle-lower and middle class folks.  Most rich people make little-to-no income, they make all their money off of their wealth.

Yes.  OP, please re-read this one carefully.  I'm glad you're enthusiastic about Bitcoin (we need you!), but I think the best role here is for you to find out what your boss is thinking/interested in, and answer questions for him.  If he has no questions, I think the best thing would be to dispel some of the myths about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:06:05
It's on the way:
If I recall correctly, Coinsetter secured some major VC funding, so they should be opening a very serious operation (hopefully!).

Maybe SpiderOak should consider accepting Bitcoin to draw Bitcoin's privacy-minded users away from Dropbox, right?
Although now that you mentioned them, I'm seriously considering moving my paid account away from Dropbox to these guys.  I see that they have version history like Dropbox, which is great.  
If they accepted Bitcoin, I wouldn't even hesitate.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:56:21
There are a number of reputable Bitcoin payment services that immediately turn BItcoin payments into USD if you so desire.  Bitpay does this, as does coinbase if I'm not mistaken.

You should move to North Korea.  I believe North Korea has fully subjugated its population and established a "strong government".  Seriously, when you see a country that has completely eradicated civil liberties and rid the land of dissenters, you can appreciate freedom.

If you follow r/bitcoin for more than a few days, you will note that *each day*, several new small to mid-sized businesses announce that they are accepting Bitcoin.
Several large companies accept Bitcoin, and I'm guessing more are on the way.
So regardless of what happens at the exchange, Bitcoins can be spent, right here, right now.

If there were any meaningful difference, please rest assure people/bots would arbitrage it out.  Turns out it's super easy to arbitrage digital currencies (it's only tricky if it involves fiat).  Look at the rates on Ripple to see an example of what happens to Bitcoin in a closed system, even at relatively low volume.
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:20:15
Yes, exactly.  The entire financial establishment is fearful of Bitcoin, since they don't understand it.  Ergo...
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:59:02
No, this is not satire.  It's possible that the journalist is a Bitcoin supporter and wrote it with a touch of satire to tweak the noses of the authorities, but I have no doubt these quotes from the Vice Minister are real.
For example, see his final quote: "The representatives of Finance Ministry say that the digital money and the accounts they are stored at should be identified, since anonymity of payments is Bitcoin’s main characteristic."
They're concerned about it.  And they're seriously concerned about banker jobs.
Tengri News is a recognized English-language newspaper from Kazakhstan, kind of like China's China Daily in English or Moscow Times in Russia.

Give it time, it's getting there.  First it has to get in enough hands to benefit from the network effect, and the quick rise in value is doing a great job of getting Bitcoin in peoples hands.  Just like the (almost inevitable) bubble burst will then cause them to all start spending it.  This cycle actually works to Bitcoin's advantage.
@_date: 2013-04-28 15:08:26
Although it would definitely be interesting to track this.  I'm tempted to do this (in addition to my regular USD tip) if for no other reason than to track the rate at which people redeem the btc tip.

For me, it was the FinCEN document earlier in the week that changed my family's tone.

Agreed.  If Bitcoin is going to advance from early adopters to the general population, it will have to get much easier to use.  And it is...slowly.

Awesome answer.  Is this quote original or did you see it somewhere?

Well, the "prime directive" of many anarchists and libertarians is the non-aggression principle.  And war is one of the most egregious offenses against that principle.  So I think it's goes beyond a simple opportunistic talking point for many people of this political persuasion, as I'm sure you know.
