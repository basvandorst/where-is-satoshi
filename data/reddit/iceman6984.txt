Has anyone done the math on if the TX fees would be more than the cost to maintain the hardware in regards to paying the rent, electric, IT support, lifecycle replacement, etc?

Really valid point, Bitcoin can not adapt under those conditions.  
Wouldn't hurt other coins that do not have a speed/scalability issue.  
These tax conditions could have negative effects on some coins, but benefit others.  Question is, can you determine which ones it will effect positively and invest in now before anyone else catches on.

He's a hypocrite, he's is also investing in crypto/block chain.  
What he meant to say was "It is to risky for the average joe so let us rich guys handle this."

Or you can just go to H&amp;R Block.

"In this scenario, ‘commodity’ applications like messaging, social media and application infrastructure like file storage and compute become very much like public utilities"
Here is the highlight I got from the article, find the coins that specialize in these areas and invest now before they do.
