Ok so not half, lol. I️ would buy $100 bundles and I️ would only have about $90 to spend after it got on bittrex. When I️ send GRS to bittrex it costs me like a few pennies. I’ve only been in crypto for a month and I️ don’t even bother with a bitcoin wallet. Im not paying even $2 for a transfer fee when other coins do it very inexpensively. Most people look past the fee cause of the brand name. Fuck that. Now if I️ had $500,000 I️ would put it in bitcoin because it’s secure and would pay the fee. But for people like me getting started fuck that fee.

I’ve heard of this happening, I️ don’t really use bitcoin though just for this reason. I lose half my damn investment every time I️ send from Coinbase to bittrex. I️ downloaded the blockchain app initially from the App Store and it has different speed settings for sending bitcoin. Haven’t used anything else. I️ think I’m going to just buy ethereum or litecoin from Coinbase from now on and just send those to bittrex and swap from there since the trading fee is much smaller than sending bitcoin.

I’m hoping to use bitcoin instead of either one;)

Wells Fargo has never rejected any of my transactions, not sure what the problem is  on such a low dollar amount. Where else can I buy bitcoin that is trusted? I’m already frustrated with Coinbase.
