My clues for you:
1. You are wasting your time on the +1, try +1 clues. That's common internet comment for agreeing or thumbs up. So the real clue is the message before. Like in the first time u/cryptogreetings said +1 the message it was reply to was "That's a bitcoin address not a public key" so that's the real clue. And when u/cryptogreetings said "try +1", it was reply to u/brblol's comment "I give up" meaning that they respect the effort or, the previous comment by u/brblol was about reference to movie. So he/she might have been on to something.
2. Clue: "To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot." To Infinity and Beyond is reference or just using the same known frase as in Toy Story. As u/pg3crypto pointed out. Or of course could mean that from x to "infinity sign" and beyond that, what makes me thing that why everyone is only focusing on the middle part.  -&gt; This bonus clue was removed, because it's misleading or too revealing? I think at least partly miss leading.
3. The clue for getting rid of almost half of the words means of course that only half or such in the pic are not Bip39 words or only the small words counts.
4.  My guess for the now removed passphrase would have been Pac-Man. Since 257 is at the X, and 257 is the kill-screen in packman :)
And now u/cryptogreetings will give me "1. +1" and if I also got Pack-Man right/close I'll get also "4. +1".
I hope that saves lot of time from you not focusing on the falsely interpreted clues.
p.s. so if I get the Bip39 words and type it in to e.g.  so which one of the key's I need to import e.g. to blockhain.info? There are so many options on the page when you scroll down, or is that part of the puzzle?
Great way to spend nights and not sleeping
Thanks!'
