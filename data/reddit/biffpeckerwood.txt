Schadenfreude much?

This is HUGE! If this doesn't signal legitimacy then maybe nothing will.
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:06:54
This was clever, well done!
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:39:22
Thank you, this helps. I guess my next question then is how do you put a "network on top of Bitcoin". I've looked for a more technical drill-down on Bitcoin/blockchain in general. So far haven't found anything that's easy enough to understand for the layman, but advanced beyond "well, Bitcoin is a ledger..." -type explanation.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:10:32
Wait so this is REAL? haha that's awesome!!
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:58:25
I actually lol'd,  thanks for this! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:40:34
This guy knows everything about everything. Amazing.

A MILLION dollars to free software? Sorry this doesn't sound right. We got 1 in 5 kids living in poverty in the US. You want to make a difference,  send your money to No Kid Hungry or similar charity.
Or better yet, focus all your money on ONE area and eradicate the problem. With your 5000 BTC you could probably feed all poor children in your city for years. 
 If you have so much money to burn, please burn it in a way that benefits the weakest of them all, not just geeks and whatever sounds cool at the moment.

I'm confused by this and googling Lightning Network either has confusing tech speak or something unrelated. Can someone point me to place with a VERY SIMPLE explanation of what LN is and what it does? Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:41:08
Geez sorry I don't read each and every post on Reddit. Good lawd. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:41:31
Update: they cancelled the transaction. I did send them an email requesting to do so, but it looks like they actually cancelled it because they didn't like my verification pic. (you have to hold your credit card next to your face, covering the middle digits with your fingers). Retarded process, especially since I've done it before and it worked just fine. 
Also, their fees are ridiculous.
Hate Simplex. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:28:35
yeah just saw that youtube vid, too. Very fricking cool!
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:44:44
Interesting, I didn't know that. Thanks!

Now on another note (let's forget the possibility of NSA being able or even wanting to break the encryption). I'm wondering if that white paper is what inspired Satoshi to create the system. I mean,it's pretty dang close,isn't it? And if so,... what other nuggets from the NSA military tech sectors are waiting for us to be discovered and put into reality?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:22:07
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:05:25


THAT is a pretty scary and eye-opening assessment. Thanks for pointing that out. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:02:08
that stupid Bitcoin.com wallet shows BCH by default on top, then BTC below that. I accidentally copypasta'd my BCH address instead of the BTC address when purchasing BTC from Simplex. I contacted their support but ... well, you guys probably are quicker. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:19:40
If you are real then you, Sir, may be one of the greatest humans of this era. Even as an atheist I must say: bless you for doing this!

This all seems like a fairly easy way to really muck up an entire financial eco system and destroy a lot of lives. If certain powers to be wanted to "change the status quo"like force an all-digital currency and do away with (untraceable) cash, all they have to do is
1) break the current cryptocurrency system/make BTC tumble into oblivion
2) introduce some magical, super-secure,"unhackable" NEW crypto (ideally through a third party that's not associated with them) and off we go. 
Meh, probably just being too dystopian now, nvm the dark cloud. I'm sure it's all good.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:55:59
OK that was clever 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:55:33
The NSA has nearly unlimited computing capacity. Don't confuse them with the average hacker mill in Russia somewhere.
They also might be employing outside-the-box methods like these guys here 
Again, not arguing with you here, just feeling sorta dumbfounded now.And I certainly do not want this to happen, I just poured most of my life savings into BTC so... yeah. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:40:18
Fair enough but Tor network is only as "secure" as the exit nodes - many of which may or may not be owned by NSA (or really, anyone who wants to snoop on people). 
Also, NSA being able to crack encryption like that could potentially mean they'd undermine bitcoin's integrity, no? I'm probably just reading too much into it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:47:50
I agree, I'm always a little dubious with statements like "wedon't need to worry about government manipulation of opensource software".
First,NSA likes to operate beyond the scope and rules of our own government. Second, being open source just means people can check  the code, doesn't mean anyone actually does on a regular basis. Again, this is just wild speculation but when I saw his post it did make pause for a sec. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:02:07
Good to know. What will happen to all the pre-hack transactions though?Also,wouldn't that spark a huge loss in confidence from institutional investors? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:00:19
Those are exactly the kind of questions I had when I got started, and I think Coinbase is a decent place to start for us newbs.Yes, the fees suck. But you can "graduate" to their GDAX, which has lower or no fees. I think it's fair to pay extra fees to have the speed and convenience Coinbase offers over the competition (although, they could reduce 'em a little bit....)
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:45:39
Wow amazing work! Very clean and modern.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:13:04
Only started mining a couple days ago so only lost like 7 bucks but these hacks don't instill  a lot of confidence in this whole thing.  So many breaches. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:39:00
FOMO, man. It's real. You hear everyone and their brother getting into it and at one point you just break and do whatever it takes to get SOMETHING. If that means using credit or loans, then so be it. Probably a terrible choice but who wants to be sitting there in 5 years thinking "I could be a MILLIONAIRE now if I had just invested in 2017"
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:48:13
Hahah so true!
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:26:30
Bunch of nerds who got lucky by being at the right place at the right time and suddenly know everything move to a hurricane stricken third world place in hopes of building their own utopia... with hypothetical money and apparently zero loyalty to their home country.  Revoke their citizenships. And once PR has to start building a real infrastructure, fix damage, and repay its loans, suddenly there WILL be taxes.

Anyone who can code something decent and usable AND make a nice promo video in a few months deserves a hit. Hope this works out for you man!

He's a smart guy with a lot of knowledge about a lot of things, but he is a self-promoter first. His free stuff is actually pretty good, watched a few on Insta/Facebook. 
I did once buy into his Millionaire Mentor course for like $600 with the promise that he would personally communicate with those who signed up, discuss personalized needs etc. None of that happened and his customer support was non-existent. I felt like an idiot for paying. I had to charge back my credit card which in 20 years of using them I've done maybe 2-3 times. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:22:09
Ah ok! That makes more sense. And I just saw some for 56 and 62 as well. Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:19:41
Customer service didn't even reply when I asked about it. A guarantee is only as good as the entity honoring it. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:38:05
Yeah, I didn't like it. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:20:49
That's a beautiful way of seeing it, thank you for shining some bright light on the dark spot :)

This guy gets it. Was wondering where all the Pantera references are.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:31:04
A true tech pioneer and visionary...not so much when it comes to finances. He'd still be a broke genius if it wasn't for other people making him rich using his technical knowledge and curiosity and monetizing it. No disrespect to this true megastar of tech but I wouldn't really be too worried about any financial advise or actions he gives or takes. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:38:24
Too busy being bitter and envious to keep job. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:27:59
Yeah not at this time, and not BTC. Too volatile. State taxes are supposed to pay for roads, schools, etc. Let's not gamble that away with currency that can literally go from 20K per unit to 6K per unit within 2 weeks. 
I'm all for using a form of crypto for anything, including taxes - but BTC it ain't. (I don't have a solution for this, just know this sounds like a bad idea if using BTC.)
Also, the rep's statement makes me think he's a little clueless:
“The ease of use, being able to do it in the middle of the night, being able to do it at home while you’re watching TV,” Rep. Weninger said.
Well, you can hop online and pay your taxes with credit card or online check in the middle of the night and watching TV, too. I know because I literally do exactly that every quarter. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:54:29
Still means they have that much money and put a limit order in. If they didn't have the money, it wouldn't take the order. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:17:23
That's the largest buy I've seen on GDAX so far. At those prices it makes sense but...wow, that's a lot of coin. Literally. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:16:40
Don't know if they're just pandering to the community or Rick is really into BTC but this is the second easter egg about Bitcoin I've seen on there. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:18:46
I lol'd!
