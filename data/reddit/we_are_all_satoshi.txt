Correct, don't ever set it to zero, but you can set it small enough that it is practically zero. Don't ever go more than 0.0001 (currently 4 cents) as this is enough to transaction within an hour, or you can go 0.00001 (half a cent, which is basically zero) if you only need it confirmed within a day

I think it depends how long it took to build up that reserve. For example, if you had a year's worth of your 401K/savings or whatever, worse case scenario you lose it all, but you can earn it all back next year. Now if you've been saving for 40 years, and decided to go "all in" in Bitcoin that's a lot more risky.

This is why the typical Keynesian arguments against inflation don't work. People can't hold a deflationary currency forever. They will eventually need to sell it for housing, food, healthcare, etc...

Assuming that Bitcoin has no change in growth in the next 4 years, the price should double just on the merits of supply and demand, as in 2020, there will be another halvening, so the price should be $2000 in 2020 at a minimum. 18% annual growth, not too shabby.

Why? What do you think it's worth?

1) 10K Bitcoin would put the total marketcap around $200 Billion. Does this seem reasonable to you?
2) How much is 10K worth to you? Is it your life savings? Or can you easily save up that much money in a year. If it's the latter, worst case, you lose 10K that you can make again next year, best case you return x10 or more on your investment, maybe even retire early.
EDIT: as an optional investment, maybe put $1K into each of the 3 major altcoins (Ethereum, Monero, and Dash) That possibly solve some of Bitcoin's problems. But do your own research here, and don't spend too much on these.

The ultimate solution to crypto security does not exist yet.

There is not a simple solution that protects from physical and digital theft.

And $16000 if the price continues to double every year based on the current trend of the last two years.

A 256-bit key, has 2^256 = 10^77 possible combinations, so on average it would take, half that many hashes to break, which at the current hashrate is a Trillion Trillion Trillion Trillion Years!

I made this chart to depict the number of consecutive days that Bitcoin has remained above a certain price threshold. For example, the Bitcoin price has remained over $100, for over 3 years in a row, 2 years for $200, and just over 1 year for $300. Data was based off CoinDesk, which I think gives the closing price for that day, so it does not include anomalies where the price might have dipped below a certain threshold for an hour and then recovered.

I'm not sure you can draw trends from this. At least the way the data is being presented. The point I was trying to emphasize here is long term stability of Bitcoin as a store of value. The Bitcoin price has remained above $200 for a few years now, so I think it establishes that price point as a really strong price floor, barring a catastrophe, like a flaw in sha-256 (super unlikely) or something.
@_date: 2016-12-02 13:41:19
The difference is, this time the price has been slow and gradual to $800 (over the course of a few years) instead of $100-$1000 in a month during the price peak. So the price has strong momentum behind it.

No, there aren't too many people. The author doesn't even use numbers to explain why/whynot we are currently crowded. We're talking 1 MB every 10 minutes, or 52 GB / year. On my 1 TB HD it would take 16 years to fill, and by that time there will be larger harddrives. I think we could increase the blocksize by x4 or even x8 right now with no issues. Sure we run into problems near Visa level transactions, and other solutions can come into play then. But right now a quick and easy solution can be implemented by a x4 increase or even a x2

Well, if one Satoshi was ever a penny, then 1 BTC = $1 Million, putting the entire market cap at 21T, and if 1 Satoshi equaled $1, the entire market cap would be 2.1 Quadrillion. So it's probably safe to say there is enough divisibility for a while :)

How this analysis was done. The price return is in terms of BTC not USD. So essentially, how much it grew relative to Bitcoin. Using data from coinmarketcap, I compared the current price (today) vs the price at the beginning of January. I only included coins that have been around longer than a year (sorry, no Ethereum classic, no Zcash). I also just looked at the Top 100 Coins to filter out all the low volume crap. (otherwise CorgiCoin would have been number one)
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:29:03
Bitcoin does not just act as a medium by also as a savings account for some people, so I think you have to use the estimate that includes all savings/checking accounts, which according to your chart is 80T, yielding a bound of $3.8M when using this estimate. Either way Bitcoin is extremely undervalued in my opinion because if just 1% of wealth entered this asset, then price could vary between $2000 to $32000.

Maybe a picture helps illustrate the [concept.]( Metcalfe's Law says that the price of bitcoin is proportional to the number of users squared. And historically this has been pretty true. (I remember seeing somewhere it was about an .80+ r^2 value, 1 is perfect correlation). So the price of Bitcoin is actually undervalued right now, so a correction is due at anytime.

I've actually been working on making a chart like this. I've noticed the same pattern. Every bubble, the price increases x20 and then falls to 20% of the peak. For example, the price went from around $12 to $250 (x20) and then fell to about $50 (20%). And the most recent bubble, we went from $50 to $1000 (x20) and then fell to $200 (20%). So the estimate for the next bubble is $200 to $4000 which would be a (x20) increase, and then a pull back to $800 (20%)

$1 Trillion is about $2.7 Billion /day. Right the demand for Bitcoin is about $50-$100 Million /day. So this represents a potential x25 or x50 increase in demand which would probably correspond to a x25/x50 increase in price, which would result in a $16000-$32000 Bitcoin

Quantum Computers weaken security but do not break it. Shor's algorithm reduces the time it takes to break a 256-bit key. So a 256-bit key effectively becomes a 128-bit key under quantum computing. A 128-bit key becomes a 64-bit key, and so on.. in terms of computation time to break. So a 512-bit key under quantum computing is as strong as a 256-bit key is now.

1. It could still be hacked (unlikely)
2. Civilization collapse could cause "The Grid" (and the Internet) to go down (very unlikely)
3. Mining Centralization
4. Scalability - Bitcoin will fail to serve more than 1 transaction per second and long confirmation times
5. Government Regulation
3 through 5 are probably the most likely
EDIT: more thoughts
6. Energy costs - proof of work uses a tremendous amount of energy. (but so does the current banking system, with all their offices and computers) I've never really done an apples to apples comparison on this subject, so I really can't say either way. I still think proof of work is the best algorithm though over the other algos. (no one has been able to convince me yet on the merits of PoS) But energy and environmental costs, are somewhat of a concern.
7. The biggest thing that I think will most determine whether Bitcoin succeeds or fails, is mining profitability. Will there be enough demand for Bitcoin in the future that it will still be profitable for miners?
