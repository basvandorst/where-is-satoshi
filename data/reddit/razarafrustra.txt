So it started as the alternative for the fiat. That was its value. That is how it garnered support. Now it is on life support and the moment people realize it has no value, no practical application ... it should die, no?   
Also I do not see a situation where it could grow out of its current ecosystem without  having practical application.

I am not talking about altcoin. I am talking about bitcoin in general.

I feel most of these arguments are obsolete in 2019. Lets do it:
1.) Bank money is transferred almost immediately, however there are laws in place that extend the deposit and withdrawal time. Most of these laws are anti fraud and some even work in the interest of the customer. There is no limit that would prevent banks from offering instant transactions, however they chose not to. 
2.) No. You store hundreds of millions on a server. Server that serves as an alternative to the one already established. Que the environmental problems by having 2 huge databases just to provide an alternative to already existing option to store value. 
3.) Because it is finite we could easily be finished ( hehe) in an event similar to Greece crisis in EU.  People think that governments are doing something evil by printing money. 
4.) Until a first guy that does not have enough BTC to buy a house visits a guy that has 2 much. That is how loans started and how a person gains monopoly. Not through force but through general consensus. 
5.) 
6.) ok first good point. However we should debate the role of banks in the banking system. I would argue that a company like Amazon would prefer to have a separate service to pay their own employees instead of dealing with millions of transactions on a payment day. So here we go again - how is amazon?
7.) ok, but again the question of how useful banks are arises
8.) fees are a percentage because you pay for the service - you pay for people to handle it, for system to run it ... but ok
9.) how problematic is forgery today anyway? I am unsure because it seems that it can easily be detected through scanners so I am not sure if this is really extremely lucrative in 2019
10.) I don't like the idea of masses being in control of their funds. I think 90% of people at any age is not capable of making good decisions. I think BTC is a good example.

AHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAA. 
where is the base for such growth?

I do not see how a chargeback can be performed without a mediator between the contractors. If it is too easy to make a chargeback the system would get exploited and if it is too hard ... chargebacks become impossible. 
I think that masses are simply not smart enough to be in charge of value and would FUCK everything up. I agree that I worded the sentence poorly. What I meant is that by giving the masses power to govern anything ... they will fuck it up.

how does something that is not valuable have value?   
This is an interesting case. in traditional market you invest in oil because you are convinced that somebody in the future will buy it for more because it will be needed - be it to power a machine ...  
In case of bitcoin you bet that it will have value even if it itself is not valuable. I can see this collapsing.
@_date: 2019-07-28 11:18:14
I know. I am responding to your general assumption "   I don't see any altcoin taking over bitcoin's network effect and brand recognition anytime soon. If ever. "
@_date: 2019-07-28 09:27:56
I do get your point. However my question is what can bitcoin offer as a digital token value that banks cannot.
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:46:59
Imagine putting an additional 0 at the transaction. Oops you just transferred 400 000€ for the car worth 40k. Tough luck, mate  
This is a big problem with a modern society. We never understand why we are being obstructed. "I had to wait at an airport an additional 20 min just to catch out the suicide bomber standing next to me in the wait line. Outrageous".   
Most of these limits are there so they protect you. Like daily withdrawal limit. It is set to a couple of hundreds so a stranger doesn't hold you at gunpoint while you withdraw every single penny.   
Also a lot of these obstructions are created by law enforcement agencies and forced on banks. If bitcoin ever become popular you can bet something like this would happen. These anti fraud and anti terrorist acts are no joke.

How does a coin whose value is entirely based on fiat serve as a failsafe against capital restrictions? : )

Decentralisation is extremely complex topic, which would require for us to debate a lot of the reasons why banking system exists in the first place.
It is wrong to assume a banking system was created by evil corporations who willingly stole everything. It is wrong to assume that banks have no other role in the banking system but to steal and manipulate value. 
Modern banking system uses a complex set of its own rules and government enforced rules to ensure that the transaction is safe. Safe for its user, for the recipient and for the general public (anti fraud and anti terrorist acts). 
Surely the system is imperfect and often it uses its power for its own benefit. 
However. Decentralization would bring:
-finalized transactions with no charge backs. This would be MESSY!!!
- inability to control the value, or enhance the value (through for eg. printing money). EU could still be in crisis because Greece tanked Euro but by being able to control the value they normalized it.
I am against decentralization. Good example of decentralized actions are Trump presidency and Brexit - if you ask stupid people question ... you can only get stupid answers.
@_date: 2019-07-28 09:25:37
This is exactly my question. What does BTC has except it being decentralised that a universally accepted digital token of value created by banks doesn't.

1. there will be no lambo temptation. The moment this becomes a problem every government will ban both mining and trasacting bitcoin due to ecological reasons. I just don't see any other way and I cannot even argue against it. 
Perhaps you are right and I overexegerate the effect. But imagine only 2 millions suddenly becoming super rich. I figure 2 millions in a country like US that would be able to invest 10k is realistic. 
In 2018 USA had 700000 new millionaires. What would that 2 million do? Is it enough to disrupt the system? Hard to predict. There could be a shortage of lambos (only 1050 are sold in a year) and since the lambo is the goal these guys would be willing to pay more than market price for them - therefore the price would skyrocket.
But we should not stop there. Millionares would be the least of our worries. What would happen with people that invested 1k? They suddenly have 100k. Would they still want to work as waiters, low office jobs. This is one problem.
However a much bigger problem ... Imagine every citizen of USA getting a financial bonus of lets say 50000 dollars (i am well aware of 4 % stats ... i am just painting a picture). Every one. WHat would happen to the economy? A big factor in logistics is to produce a bit more than you can sell. What happens when an Alienware is sold out? When people don't buy cheap bread anymore but go for premium quality? It is not just the super rich that would crush the economy but the consumer structure as a whole. 
hell we don't even need to imagine. We can look at Nvidia data. Due to demand suddenly a very basic item becomes liquid gold. Why? Because nothing else but the market itself defines the price. 
Another factor. Let's say there are 2 million new millionaires and a 20 million rich people. Unlike these random millionaires (that 700k new in USA every year) these guys are most likely very similar in both their world view and interest. Would we not have suddenly a power structure opposite to the established one? 
ANd last but not least. China. Imagine what would a btc growth likely cause there. Would China, whose companies are governement owned not suddenly become the richest country on the planet by huge margin?

Prediction: if bitcoin hits 100k it would crash the world economy. I don't know why nobody talks about that.
  
Prediction 2: it will crash at 11k
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:03:57
The problem that I see with bitcoin is that it might change the social structure. At 100k we should calculate how many new millionares are we getting, how many billionares.
Lets say it like this. The cost of TV now is relative to the investment built into it. When I try to buy the TV I am effectively trading my investment into the work I made into the investment require to make a TV. 
What happens with this balance if a totally new social structure is introduced, the structure of bitcoin millionaires? 
We would need to research how many there are (at 100k /BTC) and how much that would affect the market prices. Because there is no fixed price for the TV. Would we see prices skyrocket? 
If too many people have too much money the market adjusts according to the money available.

Please engage in conversation if you have something to say. I just woke up.

No. When I say bmazon I mean another prosperous firm that never got the same success. Therefore investment is a problem.

You just need an EMP to cripple ENTIRE civilisation. Store of value that gets deleted within seconds? No thank you.

This is not free money. This is betting that someone else will find btc more valuable than its current state. You should talk to some of the people who put houses on btc at 15k ....
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:04:11
everybody who bought for less than 10000 € at around 10k is a moron. What do you plan to make? a couple of bucks? You wont even double it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:48:34
Can you explain?
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:22:30
To what? Money is value. It cannot be infinite, that is why we have inflations. If you introduce billions of money into the existing economy it can crash because the amount of value is disproportionate to the amount of money available, ergo money becomes worthless.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:36:41
Yes but bitcoin is not really as valuable as the number represents. It is a bet.  The value is inflated based on prediction. You are not trading a real value, if we can even talk about any real value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:34:21
Yes but a lot of people bought a stock from bmazon and got burned. This is my point. No investment is free money. A few win and many lose.
