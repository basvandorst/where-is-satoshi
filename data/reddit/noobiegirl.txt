Probaly dishonest As I have seen moderators Hiding post that pop up for a few minutes and pulling them down to not let people get coins from that source. and this is Reddit were talking about. Anyways goodnight This whole bitcoin thing seems to be a joke now its all dishonesty only true use was to buy Stuff from Silk that I saw. One way or another someone will try to get Someone to believe this or believe in that. 50/50 anyway u see it.

Hey Beckham /Everyone wanting to gets coins now... I just bought some From Silkroad at insane good deal compared to most exchanges. I looked up prices and did 1,000$ worth now at the rate of 70$/Coin   Any orders under 700$ it is... 80$ per coin.. I think the minium was 300$? or 400$ not sure. But On Silkroad "vendor name was "twomuch" he/she has a awesome deal for MP!!! and i used my debit card to get a MP at walmart for 1,000$  they said I could use that or cash!

I agree with Jackten which is very true, Kudo is a retard probaly a noob sounds like,  But Jackten put a good point To my knowledge which has been over a year+ There is only 1 VENDOR that I know for a Fact is 100% been on silk over a year which is Sugar Mama I would only go through her Thats my Advice. I just pulled up her she is actually down at the moment Due to MTgox, This TwoMuch Person looks like he bought alot of coins and just trying to make some money. But Is also a Seller on the Silk, and Has been a member with Good Rep In community Also. So if I had to make a choice.. it Would be Maybe try this. Thats all I have to share :-)

Silkroad requres no info.. Vendor sugar mama or twomuch.. Twomuch is alot faster and cheaper Sugar mama is alright high rate reliable and slow. Good luck

The Fastest way Ive seen people getting coins reading On here Was on Silk Through "Twomuch" The moderators Seem to be trying to hide that info so no one will buy the coins at 90$ a piece quickly. This is a risky situation but looking as this vendor has been there year +. All I know 100% sugar mama is the safest all the other vendors are, new beside sugar and twomuch... I am having troubles with mtgox also.. -sigh- Im not the only one who has waited over a hour.

Same with me... my new bitinstant for today at least was on silkroad "vendor" "twomuch"  70$ per coin no extra Big vendor.... over year+ he quitting seems like he said mtgox not letting him pump his coins out for sell. Just bought 1k worth at 70$ a piece very happy!! MP...  is open 24/7 so yeah took about 15mins for me to get coins :))))))))
