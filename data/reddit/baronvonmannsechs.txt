To have a less fragile portfolio.

There are things that transcend the letter of the law--the letter of the law isn't the only thing that should inform your behavior and actions. The force of law wasn't being invoked or implied here.

He's appealing to the spirit of the law, not the letter of the law.

Still not the point.

It's not profit until it's realized.  People putting all of their coin into Mt. Gox didn't remove power from the hands of a few--they got fleeced by a few.  Even if you want to go all-in on bitcoin, you should consider a less fragile strategy.  It will still remain a gamble, not an investment, but at least you will not lose 95% of your net worth because of one exchange's solvency.

This wasn't the implication.  He's not invoking the force of the law, but the spirit of it.  If you disagree with the reasoning of the SEC regulations, that's another topic and a bit more on point.  
Again, the letter of the law isn't the only thing that should inform behavior, and appeals to reasons (pragmatic, ethical, or moral) are always relevant.


Right or wrong, a lot of people are doing just that right now. I don't think it's hard to argue that some people are approaching it as a commodity and some people are approaching it more ideologically as a currency.


*Should* you? I'm not sure.  This is a more relevant point, though.  I'm not really sure the mechanisms of those markets are all that different, albeit less volatile and potentially less affected by kiting in some regions.
