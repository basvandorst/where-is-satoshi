This is the best strategy. Alternatively, just keep cash on hand so you can buy if the price slumps.
But scheduled investing works for cryptocurrencies, stocks, anything.

Haha Musk didn't invent bitcoin, but that article is incredible.

Well, I don't agree with your point that they won't need money for a while. Money is as necessary to any civilization from day one as language is. What type of money they'll use is the question. 
I think I remember one of Musk's lectures about his development plans for Mars mentioning the fuel production capabilities on Mars, but I don't remember the exact compounds they would produce. And even if the solar panels output is significantly inferior to that of Earth's it isn't necessarily insufficient to power mining rigs.

I have yet to see an ICO that isn't a scam. And even if one such ICO exists, it's incredibly easy to launch one--anyone can design an alt-coin--but it's incredibly difficult to keep it from becoming a shitcoin. Haha

...unless your play money has a total market value of ~ 100 bn.

I wish I could take credit for the petition! Haha
"Satoshi Hodl" made it. But I'll take credit if Elon notices it for sure. Lol

I didn't even think of that. That's a great point. So, quite literally, cryptocurrencies could be completely reinvented on Mars. 
The cryptocurrency spaces of earth and mars would be entirely separate.

I agree. Maybe if Elon Google's his name sometime, it'll pop up and he'll tweet about it. That's the only way more people would sign it, I suppose. Haha

I can't search on coinmap, but I also found whotakescoin.com which is a comparatively better register of Bitcoin businesses. 
Thanks for the help! And cheers!

Why would it be scare? I think solar power could supply gobs of power, to use a technical term. Lol
