I'm currently traveling and don't have a secured pc to use, I don't want to store my btc on my phone since it can get stolen. What is my best option besides online?

You don't speak Czech that's the name of the cafe. Police is spelled policie in Czech.

This is a fantastic conference - Andreas Antonopoulos will be there (touting his new book).  Prague is home to Trezor as well as quite a few other bitcoin startups. Paralni Polis is an awesome place and I'm really looking forward to this year's conference.

I'm considering writing my masters thesis in Econ on Bitcoin - this will hopefully be an invaluable asset.

No problem, you guys have been good about responding to my queries but have not fixed my problem only said "it's already fixed" please return my money. If you can do that in a reasonable amount of time I will happily delete this post.

It works ok while the economy is growing. You keep adding fiat to the mix and inflation balances with real growth in the economy and creates abundance. Oil has been cited as a major factor in this growth. But yeah, eventually growth becomes unsustainable and people start issuing debt at a crazy high pace and then you get high inflation with a serious risk of deflation. The latter of which should be fine but it's deadly in a debt based currency.
