@_date: 2018-01-06 19:38:56
Impossible? Just put something on top if you don't like it.... 
Looks like he didn't put them under the cabinets so that would provide many entry points to try to pry these pennies off.... Depends What glue he used under the pennies
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:03:01
thanks, had no idea, seems kinda stupid ... so do I just leave a small lump of BTC on the node would that be enough? Or do I have to transact from the wallet regularly? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:36:54
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:51:07
True hodlers check the price every so often regularly, without any emotional reactions, if it falls, a true hodler BTFD

@_date: 2018-01-13 23:32:17
Bcash cant implement lightning since it can't use segwit
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:24:19
OK thanks
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:35:02
I installed cryptonite into firefox and went to that phishing site OP reported, it redirected me to a referral binance.com site and the cryptonite shield was green
edit: nevermind I went to binance.us.com but OP shows in the image he went to binanceus.com
edit2: yeah binanceus.com was now blocked by firefox directly so its listed as phishin site now
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:46:35
I have a Binance account if anyone wants to buy, fresh... Made it day before they closed the regs :D
Also a bitfinex and hit btc acc that I could probably change the email to a new one and sell. 
No verification was done on neither of those. 
How would you go about payment though? Use an escrow service? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:59:02
lol if you keep it running it does verify transactions....thats the point

man, than tell us your favourite charity which you know doesnt do that. There are a lot of organization that are non for profit and do only good with their work.
He didn't ask for anything, he gave you an easy option to participate in the giving so even a lazy person like you can donate without doing research.
Dean is a stand up guy and he doesn't need your chump change if he is giving 25BTC of his own...
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:30:39
So they say... They also said a while back users are complaining about his fees and then pushed a behind the door agreed upon hard fork to make blocks bigger so the fees would get smaller... So why don't they already have segwit? It's not that hard.... Bitstamp has SW since september
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:47:52
Wow this was 4 years ago?? Time flies
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:55:11
Just seen this Dean:
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:34:09
why THE FUCK would anyone in this situation sell off EVERY LAST BTC... so stupid
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:45:18

Is this legit though? Show us the address! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:35:13
I meant slow as bad, I am a mega noob in trading and it sounded to me you don't really know what you are talking about.... If is it you in the video. 
No need for the insults
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:00:37
yeah my guess too, next time dont send such round numbers and dont send the exact same amount twice consecutively
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:22:20
If an exchange plans downtime it is very shitty if it doesn't announce it at least 2 days beforehand
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:25:10
That would smell like a scam, highly unlikely
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:55:04
just keep at least 0.3 btc man.... doesnt hurt you will thank me later
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:30:54
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:48:12
yeah, when you are writing down your seed words, check them at least 5 times each word and then go through all of them once more and check them all for the last time before you submit it and create your wallet in Ledger
I just bought my ledger recently and I like it.
EDIT: oh and then don't forget to make a lot of backup with your 24 words, stored in safe places, at least one them something like the product Cryptosteel, buy a stainless steel plate and punch them in so it can't corrode or burn or get lost like a paper can
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:04:37
Or bitstamp, Segwit since september, no VC money, run by a experienced Cryptocurrency guy
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:31:26
Sounds to me you just want to know when to sell and when to buy... 
Never sell and always buy... If it dips buy much more
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:03:53
I love procrastination, I am lazy as fock ....  But I am holding 2 years now with ease... Hodling has nothing to do with delayed gratification, I am just frugal
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:53:15
but the 0.01% you give is in relation to world population? or world population older than 13 years and younger than 80 years?
Or the number of addresses? Or to the estimated number of bitcoin holders (anyone who has 1 satoshi and more) ?
I think the latter should be the case in which case I would be curious what the percentile for that is :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:50:43
I hope Coinbase gets hit with class action lawsuits or gets investigated this is clearly fraud on a major scale
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:28:55
Man Fuck you what the he'll is wrong with you! Have you ever done anything for the good of others? What the fukc are you trying to accomplish here? There is no evidence of scamming, and a mountain of evidence he is donating his own money. 
Not to mention Dean is a reputable part of the online BTC community.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:39:34
This is big
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:33:35
interestingly they have very low markup in bratislava 2% or 3% to buy
they just didnt have enough BTC on them....
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:51:52
11500€ ATH on Kraken now 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:15:57
Think again, nobody wants to sell if BTC is climbing faster then they can rebuy back into BTC, and maybe they just don't have sufficient liquidity 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:57:22

@_date: 2017-12-20 08:04:04
they launched two weeks earlier than they announced (1st Jan), before they launched someone traded it already and increased the price. Then they froze the price at 9000usd, CNBC fast money publicized that price as a normal price of Bcash... and now coinbase wiped the 9000 price from their history
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:16:15
Really slow teacher
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:17:40
yeah OP pls keep at least 5 BTC put on a HW wallet, make backup of your recovery seed (12 or 24 words) on paper and or steel or something that wont burn and put them in multiple safe locations.
Sell the rest now if you want
If I were you I would maybe buy more so I have 21 BTC and be in the 21 BTC club :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:16:51
Yeah it is a safe bet and you will be worry free

What wallet providers support importing the 24 word seed from HW wallets? 
Edit: I am asking because I didn't think I would ever need another HW wallet to restore my seed if I lose my first HW wallet I thought I could just restore the wallet in Electrum or an other wallet provider

Krakens bank for euro is in Germany... 
Do they have another bank for USD? 
I had a problem with depositing Eur to kraken once, because I used a new bank account and the name they had me on the account was last name first name but on kraken I have it first name last name......  It returned to the bank because of that, after I  opened a ticket and had to verify for another tier because of that so they would free my stuck deposit. 
But it was resolved quite fast. 
I am sure you will get your money. 
Sorry for the lost opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:49:37

I have to say I feel insulted by OP..... I cant use purse.io (I can but nobody will buy stuff to be delivered outside us since the shipping cost is huge) nor eGifter....and the fact that I even looked at using gyft and those two services should tell you that we cant do squat (ok maybe a little) directly for BTC in EU
If you wanna use BtC to buy stuff in EU, then the best way to do so is to go to an exchange with SEPA withdrawals (I suggest Kraken) and buy stuff with fiat....
Very few merchants accept Btc here

Do they though?
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:21:57

You are the pretty sure professor? 
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:25:45
Yeop, OP you are a degen. You should confess with all to your family. Seek help.
My Q, by loss...you mean what, you somehow lost fiat AND the BTC too? If you still have the BTC....stop the fucking degenerative gambling-tradin as you call it. And hold. Consider the fiat lost.
Only when you can get the amount (you consider enough) back only then sell the coin.
@_date: 2014-05-17 12:44:45
But you can send all of your circleBtc to your other address you hold privatekeys? If yes...i think many people will buy btc on circle from now on.
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:19:02
According to all this, when will the next bubble start...a wild guess? According to the charts?

IF am not running a node? I have my coins on a mycelium wallet...are they safe or should I make a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:16:49
Any tutorials how to set up a node that are trusted? I have no idea how to do it but I am confused now with all the FUD and bullshit with hardforking and BU....so I guess I need to run a node, it will also benefit Bitcoin itselfs more nodes the better...
Is it better to run a node on my main desktop or make a node of my old small netbook or notebook, if that is possible? 
Also, If I have all my coins on mycelium android wallet, should I just download bitcoin core and use that? I guess the answer is yes?
Thank  you very much for answers.

Hi guys, I need help. I installed core latest release client. Downloaded the whole blockchain it took about 3 days... Now I left it running on my pc 24/7.
Is that enough? I didn't do anything else. Do I have to change some settings somewhere?
I haven't even sent or received coins on it, is that ok?
All help appreciated. I want to run a node.

hey, I am kinda freaking out, I have all my coins on mycelium.... And now I am looking up for their stance on all this nonsense with BU and hardforks.... and looks like they want to follow roger ver and BU?
Should I move my coins to another wallet?? I do think BU is all a scam/FUD operation... 
EDIT: or does this "follow roger ver" only mean they follow his twitter account?
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:28:14
Yeah just don't disrupt the water ecosystems....   Dams and power plants on water streams tend to do that. 
BTW nice project,  I only glanced onto the Web.  Is it something like 4000 euro for 1000m2?  Wasn't Norway supposed to be very expensive?    
Edit: that is cheap land no?  Almost sounds to good.  Is it far from cities? Is there a map of the land?

wtf.... this is total bullcrap... I made a new order at 960€ for 0,9btc roughly to sell at market... only 0,58btc sold.... ???
then trying to sell the rest before it picks up after this correction...
nope... impossible
and when I click on the sell order of the remaining 0,3 or so btc to cancel it...it somehow magically closes , but now the price was at 930€ already when id did show me it close....
taking my business somewhere else....

there are no instructions in that guide for this case (mycelium) other than telling me I should wait for a mobile wallet or other app that can import my seed phrase once I already send my BTC to another BTC wallet (to not risk stealing my BTC when I try to send the Bcash)....
I would like to get rid of Bcash as soon as I can

Those exchanges were unsecured then... You cant just cancel a 2fa if you get one email, that's the whole point.... If an user's mail is compromised he can change the password easily without 2fa.... That's why 2fa exists
Kraken is very secure maybe that is why you are having a problem....

They are though... That is the bad thing... You have to research your investment.... NOT move based on emotions.... Read a little and you will see r/btc is full of shit and Bcash is not here to stay. 
And there a lot of guys like you, and that is normal, weak hands loose and somebody else profit from you. (I just hodl)

Supposedly coin base (gdax) implemented their own replay protection so as long you deposit to coin base before the fork it should be OK but meh Fuck coinbase

The point of the video is that Yeah the bubble crashes but each time Bitcoin gets higher and if you zoom out it is always climbing
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:23:40
No but really, e.g. I sold BCH at 0.06BTC and then a few days later it was at 0.12 BTC from some pumping
Still makes no difference, 2x is malicious and you should dump ASAP if you believe in true Bitcoin, regardless of money

No man I didn't profit from you, I don't day trade. I hodl that means I buy and don't sell for a long time. 
People that have inside info and made you sell profited from you selling (probably the most) 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:31:00
and your calculations are only theoretic, in real world the distribution is much different. There was a thread to statistics here two weeks ago I think, and you (0.4BTC) were definitely not the 0,007% , not even 1% 
EDIT: here it is, you are in top 25% (according to this sheet and the assumptions you can see in notes, so this still doesn't reflect the real world perfectly):
EDIT2: you were counting with the whole population which is silly (infants, not everybody know about BTC why would you count anyone in that doesn't have any)

Nope, he chose it and all that stuff was calculated from there. 
Satoshi Nakamoto chose it so it would be comparable to other currencies regardless of price (since it is divisible) 
There was an identical post like OPs a while ago where someone posted a quote from Satoshi answering the exact question

It shows we are still in the early beginnings of adoption if a group of people can manipulate the market to this extent
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:26:29
the advantage to some NOW is that they will be able to sell their 2x ASAP on coinbase since it will grant them the same amount of 2x as they have on it...
But that might not be true sice they can impose some limitations like no trading of BTC nor BT2X for 4 hours after fork, or no withdrawals or deposits or I dunno.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:23:38
100 000 new coinbase VERIFIED accounts?

Jealous, I purged my shitcoin ASAP for 0.06 btc per shitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:46:24
That's the thing, if you are coordinated with a group all of them buying up btc makes the price go up and when they dump they end up at least braking even, possibly positive.... And then if the 2x goes up that is their ultimate win since some of them will have control. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:54:03

Yeah I don't get this.... Bitcoin companies that don't have enough funds to just deliver a ready product ready for shipment immediately? With BTC at ATH? So many whales? 
Just doesn't add up why in this space with a product like this anyone would need to have pre-orders... 
I want to get an ASIC that wouldn't support Bitmain and Jihan but.... Again, This is BTC... Why should I send some money now and only get it in 4 months (hopefully, remember they offer no guarantees....) when by the time the price of BTC will probably be 12k usd 
If someone gives me a good answer to my two questions that would be amazing
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:33:32
Hell she looks old :/ I will buy it with btc if it's any good
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:31:33
Thank you man I like stats and your tables are very welcome
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:25:49
Love when in the funding or withdraw menu they have "unavailable right now" 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:54:44
But they want to support Bitcoin by selling Bcash
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:37:27
Yeah just a glitch, another one of theirs
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:14:13
Fuck, I love how complex bitcoin is.

@_date: 2017-11-03 06:26:25
what if (a crazy theory here?) coinbase said you will automatically get 2X coins and will be able to sell them, just to lure the most users to theirs site (working) only to somehow steal the coins (maybe it won't be coinbase directly but some other entity but anyways it is a possiblity)
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:14:24
hmm, % ? I got this fee amount from a exchange review site so maybe it was old.
still more than the 90€cents you have on kraken, but yeah, not much when you consider the whole amount:D
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:18:43
Hmm... You just need to make it into a quasi peom then, by changing the order so the words somehow seem fluent... 
 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:42:47
Hmm, that is a valid point I guess, but if you get your initial investment out than its just free btc 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:42:33
I will
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:07:37
Which means he is not a time traveler basically 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:58:57
Lmao Fuck them if they don't care,  you are trying way too hard and I have to agree with your buddy your texts are a bit smuggy if you look at it from the perspective of an ignorant who doesn't want to be bothered with someone giving him advice
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:21:39
Think of it like this, someone created a copy of all existing BTC 
Calls them what they want, but we all know it is a shitcoin, B2X shall we.... But there are people who are willing to buy the B2X for whatever reasons.... And that is where the money comes from, from idiots, scammers, noobs, experimenters,.. Etc
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:02:41

I wanted to buy a HW wallet but ... when you think about it, it is a small smartphone.
So a mobile wallet is the same as a HW wallet, when someone steal my phone he cant get into the system I have a 8 number pin / finger print pass
and after that a 6 number pin on mycelium still if he can brake the phone entry
but anyway, the minute he steals my phone I move the btc frmo my other phone
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:22:09
Exactly, I would be still cautious.... 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:44:35
Hold strong 
Edit: Damn it autocorrect
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:48:21
you mean they sell BTC and B2X after the split right away? I don't think there are many people that will do that
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:20:17
basically the same lol 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:08:25
Haha... Gamble

I honestly can't fathom how people can be this stupid or do stuff for money

What about the axes (is that plural of axis) ?

@_date: 2017-11-02 13:39:42
Is there a way to plot the price chart to the r/bitcoin users ? :) Is there a history of the userbase for this subreddit somewhere?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:21:38
So can I get an invite to that channel? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:33:11
Core didn't change its mind, nobody from core was invited, and even if they were they didn't want to come. Behind the door "agreements" are not Bitcoin, it's a cartel 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:58:38
don't most exchange txs from trading happen off of the blockchain? Like the trade engines of the exchanges don't use blockchain, only to withdraw or deposit right? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:15:50

Well, you could agree that the attackers saw they have no chance to succeed and wanted to save face, or something.... 
Or its a trick... 
Let me ask a counter question... If it wasn't an attack, why are 6 people enough to call of an "upgrade" to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:49:58
Roflmao Ahahaha nice work multiple independent development groups
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:32:27
I don't understand where the futures came from though, somebody had to be the first seller, where did he get them from? He had to have created them from thin air right?

@_date: 2017-11-03 17:34:32

Yep bcash falling
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:18:36
None I guess, he is alien and his hair changes color a bunch. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:47:40
Exactly, even if they somehow succeed at dumping btc price below bcash it won't matter in the long run BTC wins, better developers, much more useful coin 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:19:12
Nah that is not an argument since segwit is already active and most of the 2x signers didn't use it and segwit doubles capacity on its own

Also, shipping by DHL to neighbor country is Fukking 17€..... Stupid price
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:21:31
Can someone help ? How can I input this progression into excel? So I could extract expected price on any given future date I want? I am sure it can be done but have no idea.

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:15:14
Btc has no such adjustment? It just has to have a block each 10 minutes? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:36:15
OP does
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:01:26
since BCH had their EDA does that mean they will achieve 21 000 000 bcashs sooner than year 2140 (if we assume it survives so long lol)?
I guess so right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:47:15
so cute :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:53:59
Yeah no worries man, when it fell after mtgox, just before I convinced my sister to buy, at around 800€ per btc.... she put in 300€ :) then it fell to 250€ per btc
And held, and then withdrew half when that half was 450€ worth.... And now she has only the rest of what was bought for 150€, worth a lot more, almost 10x. 
Bitcoin crashes a lot, but if you zoom out you see it only rising
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:09:41
Of fuck my eyes hurt from reading so much on my small phone...what exactly is he saying? ELI5 if hes defending the block size increase or if he wants the blocks to remain as is so nobody can fux the blockchain and centralise it?

yeah me too, feel like a haxor now :D
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:55:42
The same way he uses a PC and Internet for other things
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:41:44
Yeah I am seriously considering to move all or some of my btc to GDAX just to be able to dump 2xshitcoin asap
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:39:11
sometimes yeah, 100% of times when you need to sell or buy fast....
its only good to buy or sell btc if there is no traffic, otherwise it sucks balls, like now for example
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:55:54
yeah, that will be fun
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:22:35

dma ?
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:48:26
I experienced the same thing... But that pre order model T made me change my mind completely... If I get a HW wallet at all it will be the cheapest one I guess, and one I can get delivered ASAP
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:36:27
Heard that too

@_date: 2017-11-01 18:24:09
Thanks for writing it all up, I am from Slovakia and I feel the same as you. It really seems to big of price and it makes it look they just expect bitcoiners to not care since the BTC is rising... Ha, I am frugal and I am not impressed 
Edit: and I was proud that they are a CZ company and wanted their product because of that, but... Meh
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:18:12

man, I can't even find my data directory, I have latest Bitcoin Core installed, full blockchain downloaded (because of the files size I moved the directory for the blockchain storage to D:/)....
and also when I checked on the bitnodes.21.co it says my IP with the port 8333 is unreachable
am I even running a node then? 
I would love to state that I am pro UASF SegWit or at least run a successful node
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:14:27
I can't find my Data Directory, I am on windows and I don't have a fodler in any of the "roaming" subfolders under any user... 
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:01:00
I showed the hidden files.... And have run the command.... No Bitcoin folder in my app data folder. Is that possible? I mean I have the client of because core synced and everything 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:28:09
why the sailor though ?
@_date: 2017-04-18 06:02:36
Yeah probably 
@_date: 2017-04-09 17:18:52
I can't find my conf file.... Or better said, not even my Bitcoin data directory

exactly, I cannot understand how anyone in their right mind, that owns bitcoin and/or follows bitcoin, would think that something else then UASF brought us Segwit finally...
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:52:46
For real? Lmao.... How much bank you need for it to operate (your btc and Fiat reserves)?
And what country you in? 
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:26:41
hehe and? thats the point :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:27:24
sounds like USA a lot, I read stories like this on the net all the time, that any money you have on yourself can be confiscated by any authority if you can't prove where you got the money from, but yeah, definitely something MAFIA does not the government 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:39:42
Def don't sell the last one. Don't fret over price, and maybe in 2 years you 1 btc will make you double the profit the rest made you haha. If not, you still have your 32k profit so you are still on top
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:48:52
What was your cost for setting it up, was it a lot of work on licenses etc.? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:51:52

yeah so one possible "solution" is that we all hodl and nobody sends anything (other than the experts that can separate their BTC from 2Xshitcoin while sending a transaction)?
So basically a drop in usage will mean less fees for miners etc....?

Spent almost everything I had left after some spending on buying for a year in college I should have spent writing my diplom thesis but instead spent doing anything but write, mostly play poker... Lol
Yeah but I stayed in BTC and I am in a nice profit now

exactly a 10 yo with a knowledge of say 30yo old would crush it in every aspect, well depends on the person though :D
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:29:43
Come on man you are now just asking questions for the sake of asking questions, stop the theatre.  
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:40:31
But also you are not accounting for all the lost BTC
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:41:49
Why then if I divide his 45 million with 130btc I get almost double your number. 
You have to have some kind of error in your calculation I think. 
 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:42:21
hmm, I will thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:42:00
let's hope :)
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:20:32
who the fukk in their right mind would give up their time ? red pill all the way ....
edit: that said, It just hit me what this is really about, wow.... imagine all the thing you would do if you took the red pill and became 10 yo again.... and now ask yourself, why aren't you doing all of those things now?? 
I am wasting my time away... I AM giving up my time.... fukk

You are not a noob then lol
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:37:32
What % profit do you want? Calculate that and set a limit sale.
Don't check on the price, set an alarm for the price you have as sell.
If you plan to tax it calculate accordingly
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:36:30

Bulls hit... Just because they spin around more money doesn't make them the economic majority... 
The majority are the users that buy stuff from those companies and use their services.... Just because the company men decided to make some sort of sharade of an agreement behind closed doors doesn't mean their users agree with it, and therefore even the money and influence or hash rate the companies claim they have is bullshit ... It's the users that are the majority. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:40:33
Hmm interesting, maybe that is why the programmers of Wow put it as translation for lol...

@_date: 2017-05-25 17:38:03
Yaaasss gooo segwit (the real one not the fake "agreement" one) 
But... I still can't work my core client to uacomment that I support it.... :( any help? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:09:15
sooo.. you are saying I should uninstall mycelium and switch to electrum.....or will you make another statement in a few days that will again change your position on BIP148?
Whatever you do, if you don't guarantee that my BIP148coins in your wallet will be safe, I am switching to electrum before august 1st
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:50:50
Just buy bro ... 
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:03:35
exactly this...
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:06:35
because without it they can still use their advantage over other miners (ASICBOOST, lets them be more efficient ergo make bigger profits (a few % I don't remember the exact number, but essentialy makes them outcompete any other miner manufacturers)
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:49:59

interesting, those fukkers stealing our kek
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:51:04
It's all a big swindle.... They can't code it in time so they will just HF and then stall their "segwit " until it can't be done anymore
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:41:10
I wonder when will your kids decide to put everything into btc and nothing into the bank accounts... 
How old are they now? At aroun 14 I would imagine the gifst from the banks won't be a big plus when they see the difference of performance

@_date: 2017-05-15 07:59:51
If you sell it, yes
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:34:04
I bought some two days ago, like I always do once every two weeks... Just now I sold a third and now comes the dreadfully part of buying back in at the right time
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:20:24
idiot, stop gibbering the same BS over and over each time someone responds to your stupid questions... if you can't see they are using ASICBoost then you are either retarded, stupidly naive, or you know they are using and you are just trying to spread lies so no one else can realize they are indeed using ASICBoost to push out competition and take over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:59:11
Just buy a small amount each week. Only what you can afford to lose if something bad happens.

Kraken is laggy as hell 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:59:06
Hey... My widget Bitcoin checker shows me a high of 2082.96€ (eur) on kraken.... When did that happen lol?  
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:33:11
lmao they are not securing the network with ASICBOOST running... other miners can't use it which means they will be pushed out by Jihan's miners which means they will be only one manufacturer of miners running PoW of the whole Bitcoin in the end which means Bitcoin is dead and no longer decentralized.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:23:03
I thought he had 1 million

thanks man, I think I solved it, I changed the firewall type to interactive mode and maybe when I enabled a rule when it asked me about bitcoin client it helped... it now shows me 2 inbound peers aswell as the 8 outbound :)

hodl isn't about selling when it makes profit.....
and a ponzi shceme is something completely different...
to hodl means you believe bitcoin will be the driving force for a new "system" without the centralization and oppression from governments and corporations, and then you won't need to sell BTC, you will just use them for pretty much everything...
true cash, but digital
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:35:39

@_date: 2017-07-21 09:26:51
Same here, but I dunno if I am counting maybe my nodes are unreachable because of firewall? .... :(
Port should be open but I have only the 8 outbound peers at all times. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:23:24
if they weren't running it covertly you you wouldn't be able to (try to) defend them, the definition of covert is basically the reason they do it covertly (if not that they can' run it overtly)...

He wasn't running it per se. He just likes to be called "Chairman". I think.

is there a guide for super non techy newbs how to "upgrade" to BIP148 ? (is signalling with uacomment on a core client node enough or do you have to do something else:)
I still haven't found time to try to ad the uacomment even, since I can't find my data directory for Bitcoin.... I think I need to reinstall the client, hopefully I can just copy the blockchain data to the new installation
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:09:30
Yeah... Ffs They are signaling to signal to signal to signal..... What? 
BIP148 UASF or else they won't activate segwit
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:02:45
Also,... if you are withdrawing to your bank account through SEPA, make sure your name on the bank account is the same, even the order of surname to firstname.....
My withdrawal didnt go through because my name on my bank account was surname first name and on kraken I have it first name surname....
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:19:49
do it, nothing to loose (other than 20K) and much to gain

They now told me I need tier3 for them to release the deposit... I submitted and the next day (sunday) it was approved.

You can make an encrypted archive backup of your Google Auth codes anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:01:52
what? I didnt know this ....
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:45:58
remember, this 80% we just got are miners signalling NYA.... nothing more... they are signalling to signal to signal..... 
they don't ever want to lock in segwit and will always find a way to not lock it in and to stall and pretend they will while they make money with asicboost
how you can't see that they indeed are using AB is beyond me
@_date: 2013-02-22 01:24:55
hmm...why do you accept payments with btc? are you hoping to make money on btc, to exchange into some fiat and buy stuff? I mean... there are some things you can buy with btc , but  I guess should try and buy some btc to try it out, what one can do with them... only if they weren't worth 30 usd...
can someone send me some mBTC? to see what how where I can apply them?
EDIT: how does the tipbot function?
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:50:56
IMO he erased the keys of the wallet(s) which holds them from exoatence
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:27:25
Me too. I got a years worth of a domain for 6 dollars ..wich left me with 60 cents coz the value climbed xD
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:36:39
Yeah they raised it from 0.0005..... But I withdrew anyway and actually the fee was only 0.0013
@_date: 2013-02-02 21:31:41
hold on, even if I have free electricity? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:56:13
But segwit2x will never activate, they just wanna HF and keep their asicboost advantage
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:29:34
so he can buy all the bitcoins with our money at cheap prices...

Yes, I had. 
30th May I asked about their stance on UASF BIP148 and they answered that day. 
8th June I sent a ticket about my on hold deposit. 10th June I had a response that I need to submit for tier3 verification. I did that right away (after reading the how to do it, specifically the part here:
  ). 
Next day the verification was a success and on 12th I had access to my deposit.

Just write your Google Auth codes (those you used to create the "accounts" on Google Auth) in a .txt file and archive it with a strong pass and encryption. Now you have a backup, you can store it anywhere, online too if you trust a cloud service or believe in your pass / encryption. 
I have moved my Google Auth codes two times using this, when I got new phones.

thanks for your lengthy reply, but I read quite some bit of that yesterday, since I stumbled upon the verge article(I didn't know about all this ASIC revolution before so I was figuring out if I can ride it). therefore I was looking for another review of someone who 'd gotten the machine already.
