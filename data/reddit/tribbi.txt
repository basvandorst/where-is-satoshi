Couple of weeks ago it was "to the moon" and "bitcoin one quadrigogazillion  bucks in 2 weeks!!!!11eleven"
Now it is "gox broke", "bitstamp hacked(?)", "{random exchange} finished", "should I STILL go BTC with all this shitty news?" and stuff like that.
Buy when there is blood in the streets.

To put this into perspective: This is a comedy show.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:45:12
yes, kraken and fidor form a great team. kraken rocks anyway. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:05:15
Please help me, seen what?
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:23:35
Being a european, I used Kraken for a while, did a lot of incoming and outgoing EUR transactions as well as BTC trading and all I can do is recommend it.
@_date: 2014-03-19 06:22:02
Yes, same here from germany. Connections gets stuck after the cloudflare gateway in Frankfurt.

China banned democracy as well, didn't harm the rest of the world.
Edit: What is annoying to me is that every other day there is this rumor of china banning bitcoin and everybody goes bananas about it.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:24:14
I've been using kraken for a while, funding my account in EUR, day trading in EUR and USD, withdrawing BTC to paperwallets, funding it with BTC from other exchanges, cashing out (seriously :-) ) in EUR and I did not run into a single problem once.
I can really recommend it. The only downside is the relatively low volume for intraday trading but that is going up slowly, too.
I also have a Bitstamp account which works nicely, too, but the kraken interface, especially for trading, is so much better and powerful.
TL;DR: kraken rocks

Please remember that not everyone on reddit is a native english speaker.

I didn't know them either but they must have been big, since the famous iExpat magazine covers them.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:40:52
Oh, with "dumb" I was referring to myself, not to you. Unlucky mistake on your side, not dumb at all.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:51:34
Yeah, looks sooooo legit.
Btw: you forgot to mention your affiliate link.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:59:30
Shouldn't it make you happy?
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:59:30
I wonder how long it will take until one sheikh complains that he cannot throw in his 1000 dirham notes by the bundle.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:47:22
German here, can confirm, please ignore OP, not worth your time.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:45:29
Unfortunately I have to agree...

You should create a password protected offline wallet. BIP38 is what you are looking for. bitaddress.org for example supports the generation of password protected offline wallets (read: paperwallets).

If they actually DO ban bitcoin it only shows how big their fear of it is.
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:19:31
Being an oldtimer I have learned that superior technologies (like bitcoin) will prevail.
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:52:07
Can confirm.
Pro Tip: If you deposit via "Fidor Bank" it only takes a few minutes.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:28:14
yes, please do it
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:27:34
Great explanation there. Thanks for the link!
@_date: 2014-02-01 15:30:24
Sorry for being dumb, but I don't understand what happened. You misentered the amount for the fee?
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:50:35
Ah! Why didn't I come up with this?
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:10:53
Or spend 10% of your one-year-total-savings on a high risk investment and put the other 90% in a low-risk-low-yield investement, say at 3%. If your high risk investment goes to zero, your steady 3% income will make good for that in 3 years. That's what I did when I was younger. Instead of buying stock, I bought warrants on the stock for a small amount of my total investment and put the rest in government bonds. Worked out nicely for me and that's what I am doing with Bitcoin now.

Some call it cost-averaging on long term investments.
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:05:54
Because if MtGox goes tits up the media will be full with "BITCOIN FRAUD", not distinguishing between Mtgox-fraud (possilby) and Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:30:37
Noone knows for sure where the market is going. 
But considering sentiment is pretty bad right now, I suppose we'll be heading up(!) again soon.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:06:50
I'm starting to hope this is true. Then we will be done with this China bans bitcoin stuff.
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:11:48
That makes sense, too!
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:12:48
Having a replacement SIM-card with the same number doesn't help at all. The 2FA codes are not connected to your phone number but to a secret key (the QR code you scan).
I recommend using the AUTHY app which has an integrated backup function and syncs over multiple devices you control (eg. phone, tablet). 
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:48:45
I tried do that. But they somehow managed to change the spam report to  (with L). At least that's what the drop down menu shows.
Edit: Never mind. I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-05 08:22:00
Excuse my ignorance but where the heck did discuss fish even come from... I didn't watch the hash rate distribution for a while but 4 weeks ago I'm sure they didn't even exist. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:19:36
Great read. Actually one of the best things I have read here in a while. It really shows that you got some life experience.
@_date: 2014-02-05 09:36:41
Thanks. I missed that post, obviously.
@_date: 2014-04-01 16:50:27
Unfortunately not. You have to have your permanent residency in germany

This is by far the most beautiful paper wallet I have seen yet.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:00:51
But I see asterisks, too. Does that mean our passwords are the same?
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:31:38
Ok, is that a well enough known fact for people to not use a 10% arbitrage deal?
If I bought BTC for say $100k at Bitstamps, transfer those BTC to mtgox, which should not take much longer than a few seconds, and then sell the BTC at a 10% premium on mtgox, I wouldn't mind waiting a couple of weeks for my cash. 
Sounds like an incredibly easy way to make money without too much risk (IF mtgox is reliable)
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:05:28
Ok, that's not good. I just moved a few BTC from mtgox to a different wallet. It took less the 5min to arrive at the new wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:01:38
Changed mine to ******3, just to be safe.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:40:38
Yes, it is valid but hardly worth the effort. Plus OP gets referral-bonus without mentioning it, so I downvoted him.
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:04:36
Yes, I did receive BTC from them a couple of times. I never paid attention to the form but it always worked.
But like I said: It's hardly worth the effort. You have to spend about an hour of looking at ads to receive like 10 cents worth of BTC.
