So your advice is not use coinbase? But it's so damn easy especially  now that they allow instant buy using debt card
@_date: 2016-04-29 06:42:11
Got the same but messaged them to see if they could raise the limit, now I'm at 60. They said limits will increase once I make more transactions.

I did that couple time but for most part used blockchain as my buffer. Don't know if those couple times got me the ban hammer.
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:30:04
So send from coinbase to wallet to gambling site?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:45:01
regulation ≠ ban

Lost my Bitcoin core passphrases any way to recover it or are my coins gone?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:56:33
I saved backup wallet. Now I have a .dat file on my desktop. Not sure what to do with it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:39:27
how? I have my wallet and see my balance but when I try to move the coins to another wallet it's telling me to type my passphrases which I don't remember.

50 dollars with bank and I don't have a credit card so I have to wait 5 days to receive btc.

so yeah you can send me the btc and I'll send cash with google wallet (can't deposit through the bank because banks will close in 30 minutes) or you can you localbitcoin and try to find someone in your area who can buy with cash 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:11:11
So I receive Bitcoin and then send you cash through google wallet? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:11:39
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:25:28
Localbitcoin does have a wallet. The person sends the btc to your LBTC account and then you're able to create a sell btc listing. You might be able to get a buyer today if your price is low enough. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:15:29
how much do you need?
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:28:39
Isn't this what you're looking for? Someone sending you cash in exchange for btc?
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:18:07
with localbitcoin you can sell it locally for cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:23:30
If it's around 400 I might be able to help you out since that's how much money I have in hand right now. Can I  deposit the money into your bank account?

if China outright bans crypto we will see a loss of value but it doesn't mean it will die out, or will it?
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:45:01

@_date: 2015-11-11 05:29:33

@_date: 2016-05-20 06:57:08
How can I get access to the coins?

How long does syncing takes for someone who is behind 3 year and 30 week using the updated version? Bitcoin Cord is slowing down my computer.
