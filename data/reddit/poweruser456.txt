Is that a flying wedgehorn that's impacting the charts or a triple candle hammer with extra mayo? My penny stock advisor is doing a short stint in prison so I'm asking for your charting expertise.

Ah you have observed well young TA trader, however what you are saying is absolutely wrong. I plugged in some inverse tamborine play into my stochastic calculator I got from a well respected penny stock investor in my spam folder and it's pretty clear that a reverse iranian frog satchel is emerging into what may possibly be the mother of all bull flags. It's like the great Ted Talker Tai Lopez said, the more you learn, the MORE YOU EARN.

The circle jerk on this subreddit is to hate Coinbase because its funded by "banksters." No logic. Just petty, toxic commentary.

I'm a holder of many coin for years, I'm very concerned about China and China only. They are an overly significant portion of Bitcoin volume and at any moment their government can decide to shut down Okcoin and send BTC crashing. Their reason for this would simply be to control the flow of their currency which currently they are doing in so many ways. Most recently they have capped cash withdrawals at Macau casinos. The Chinese want to diversify away from the Yuan and the government is trying to prevent this at any cost.
They have restricted the exchanges before and sent the price downward. It could happen again easily.
See that big 2013 spike? Guess what sent it down?

Liquidity / Cost Savings. I have a few gold bars. I also have some Bitcoins. If I ever need the bars I'm going to lose a significantly larger chunk to exchange it for USD in comparison to BTC. Not only that, it would take me much longer to exchange it. Perhaps my scenario is a little extreme but the only exchangers near me hack 10% off spot price on offers.
You can buy GLD or some ETF of course but you are paying .40% management fees and brokerage fees as well and then its not really in your personal possession.

The Yuan/USD is about to hit $7 which should put a lid on any need to convert currency away from the Yuan because the government said they will intervene at 7.

Yes but currently they are trying to stop a rapid devaluation. Stability is important to their economy.

You realize this is China right? The government will stop at nothing to prop up the Yuan if that is their goal. Which would include banning BTC exchanges.

The easiest way to keep people in BTC vs dollars is to pay them in BTC. With a BTC debit card you can easily tackle living expenses. However stock investments + some transactions requiring bank accounts such as home purchases inevitably involve a legacy bank account.
But then comes the issue of the tax repercussions (in the US at least).

He is not dumb. He plays devil's advocate and approaches the Bitcoin idea from a skeptical typical consumer viewpoint. It's good he does this because it continually addresses the major issues challenging widespread adoption.

I've never considered using another cryptocurrency for transactions. For one, they aren't really accepted anywhere. Two, I have no interest in acquiring them because they seem risky and non are really as stable as BTC.

Agreed, the nationalism in mainland China is disgusting. Free thought is permitted it just can't be communicated. The Great Firewall shows how draconian mainland China is. China is a country built on the theft of intellectual property and inhumane industrialization. They will be worth absolutely nothing when their cheap labor can no longer undercut machine automation. They will no longer be able to export their problems.
On the other end we have progressive eastern areas such as Japan and HK.

To be fair, Bitcoin ATM fees are pretty high as well. I understand there are costs to servicing and maintaining the ATMs and I am hoping that the Bitcoin ATM owners will consider lowering fees as volume increases.

While you are here: 
I run a shop that accepts strictly Bitcoin, ~50k/mo revenue. I push customers through Circle currently. The extra step of having to buy coins into the wallet and then access the wallet to send coins creates anxiety for many new users, one additional step of instructions is unnecessary. If they could simply add their payment details to the app one time, scan the QR code and then have a prompt that says, you do not have X bitcoins in your wallet, would you like to buy coins and send them now? - That would be huge. I know it doesn't promote holding Bitcoins but it promotes easy commerce which currently is a problem for the masses.
Just an idea for you guys. Cheers and thanks for the update!

You guys have no idea how prevalent fraud is in an industry where someone can get away clean. Think about it... 100 people make $1000 orders for coin. If 1 of those 100 orders is fraudulent, coinbase is in the red. I say red because they have this thing called EXPENSES....

Urban population accounts for about 50% of the total global population. Currently if what you need is cash in hand then yes ATMs will be the only option and it simply isn't widespread enough yet however all things begin in urban areas for this reason and then sprawl out.
A few years ago downtown Chicago only had 2 Bitcoin ATMs and now it has 10. That growth isn't too crazy but it's getting better. And now the first one has popped up in the burbs. 
Of the few that I have used, the store owners said they get quite a lot of traffic.

Explicitly? Not so sure about that. Megaupload had dozens of legitimate use cases.
And it's only criminal because laws can be paid for. It should be solved in civil courts.

You understand how this works. Our natural gas and oil producers would shut down immediately with AscotV logic. That's not exactly what happens when oil/ng production becomes unprofitable (Like with today's prices) and it's the same case with btc mining. Sure there may be less investment in additional production but shutting down is generally not what happens.

They flag addresses I noticed. If they see multiple people signing up and sending to one address they freeze the account. Probably think this is some credit card fraudster or something which makes sense.
That's just one case of course. Others include flagged transactions for gambling etc.

Currently Bitcoin gambling is at the reduced house edge stage. Less overhead = lower house edge.
I believe the next phase is a peer to peer protocol where two people can bet against each other at a zero house edge. OR a developer they can simply offer zero house edge website and implement a tip system so players can tip at their own will, similar to dealer tipping in a casino. Won't work for "virtual slots" however peer to peer sports betting is a big one.

KYC/AML/Antifraud is unfortunately the biggest drag on merchants. To get non bitcoin/first time users signed up is a major pain in the stones. 
I understand the antifraud part 100%. Requiring ID reduces likelihood of fraud by a very large margin. It's just unfortunate for those that are trying to get their entire customer base to 100% bitcoin. It needs to be made even more simple for new customers. Your average person is not too savvy.

It helps Bitcoin, and has potential to REALLY help Bitcoin. See currently every gambling game you lose 1-5% , remove the house edge and not only does it make gambling compelling but it has the potential to destroy all current retail and online gaming.
Offering poker without a rake, offering slots without an expected loss, offering roulette without a green slot on the wheel, etc... All of this turns your expected value to net neutral which would flip the gambling world upside down.
Sports betting without a house edge? Massive. When somebody actually creates a system off BTC/Ethereum that reduces all house edge, the inflows of BTC/Ether will be insane.
It proves the deflationary potential of technology.
Bitcoin gambling in its current state still shovels massive amounts of $ into the house. Let's make gambling net neutral and all of a sudden the market will blow up. To do this would require peer to peer staking because nobody would tie up their bitcoin capital without an expected return unless they are gambling themselves.

Yes I'm not arguing that Bovada is the market leader, but lets see what happens in a few years from now. Bitcoin has drastically lowered the barriers to entry in this market. Efficient players can run at a much lower edge rate.

I used WU for some business transactions before and they completely blocked people from sending money to me online. Turns out it was good ol KYC/AML.

Bovada is a legacy gaming site though. They still have a ton of overhead and have no need to change their business model until disruptors with low edges and high credibility start pulling their market share down.
Compare it to
