Don't stock and mutual fund companies operate on the same principle?  One difference is insurance.  You can leave cash sitting in a brokerage account.  Later on, you can either buy a stock or withdraw it.

I don't normally watch the show, but I hated it.  If the laptop is worth a million bucks, why are a man and his wife arguing?  Just put a smile on your face and get the laptop.  Sheldon is being an asshole with money which is worse than your standard asshole.  His fiancé should refuse to marry him, because he could do the same asshole stuff to her.

If a mutual fund pays dividends, that is reported to the IRS and almost all mutual funds pay dividends in an up year like this year.  It also gets reported if you sell shares.

In the stock market, a whale may be someone who buys or sells so much that they cause the price to change.  That is a slightly different definition than someone who owns a lot.

I normally get all of my tax forms by February 15.  Will this be done by then?  I hate when a tax form shows up after I've paid taxes.

You couldn't get evicted that fast unless you were stupid.  Logically, you would withhold enough money from the loan to make a couple mortgage payments before investing in Bitcoin.  Buying all of your bitcoins at the high point would be hard to do unless you are unlucky or a troll.

I am also a novice.  I applied for an account on July 9 and bought my first partial Bitcoin on July 22.  Given the hassle of opening one account and the fact that I was on vacation, there was no good way to transfer Bitcoins.  I went with Gemini instead of Coinbase; they have a similar issue.  Gemini is based in New York, so they are subject to US laws; I'll see what they end up doing.

I don't understand this statement.  I transfer money from my bank to another company where I buy bitcoins.  How would the bank know or why would they care that I'm buying bitcoins?

The problem is that I am still not up to one complete bitcoin and if the price keeps going up, I may never get there.

Gemini has already released BCH to its users and Gemini is US based.  Maybe there is a tax reason for waiting until next year.

Does the URL contain a weird character and if so, why?

I have a BA.  Gold has the same problem as Bitcoin.  It is worth money, but it is hard to say why it is worth money or how much it should be worth.

I first heard the phrase "dead cat bounce" in 2000 when NASDAQ crashed.

Why would it piss you off?  Maybe your friend bought BCash on purpose.

Wouldn't investments match up with paychecks?  If you get paid every 2 weeks, wouldn't you invest once every 2 weeks.  Daily investing seems strange.

Setting up a website costs money, but if you have one, you can setup 100 forwarding email addresses.  I like the idea of a short name.  Good short names like pint and dog are already taken.  You can make up a word or acronym.  Be careful with ambiguous characters like zero and oh, because you may have to write an email address on a piece of paper.

If this lawsuit goes forward, the victims will need to prove that they are victims.  They will need to prove that they lost money due to this.  This means that they will have to tell the court about all of their Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash trades which means losing privacy.  Bitcoin was originally about privacy.

I went to the WikiLeaks website and didn't see any new leaks.  Nothing for 2018.  Are they still active?  I know that Julian Assange is stuck in an embassy.

If you die, your heirs can inherit your bank account.  If you have Bitcoins sitting on a thumb drive, it may depend on how much you trust your heirs.
