I'm extremely spoiled. There used to be an ATM about 15 miles away so maybe a 20 minute drive. Currently the area is being fixed so they moved the ATM much farther out. It's now a hour One Way Drive. I highly recommend the ATMs. Sure they charge five percent fee(or more)  but usually within minutes cashing out you're quite happy to hear the coins hitting your wallet. The other thing is that you don't have to provide ID purchase is up to $1,000 depending on the ATM. Nothing Stops you from putting in a thousand and then two minutes later doing it all over again.

I truly doubt there will be a day that Bitcoin is worth 500 again at least not Without nuclear war or something else just as drastic happening. More than likely if it does have a reset. It'll be to the 8 to 900 range. Either way I'll be standing by with funds to buy the dip even if it means taking a loan out on my retirement.

Okay just hurting themselves by mining empty blocks they're missing out on the extra funds from the transaction fees?

I know I've been looking through any possible device that might have had old Wallets on it. Heck I even spent $15 to get a new battery for my old Nexus tablet. I swore I would always set aside 10 coins just in case. This was back when I cashed out most of my coins for $16 a share after having purchase them for about a dollar 75. I was trying to short them at the market never dipped

I know I personally read every single transaction even though I cut and paste it just to make sure

The truth is though is that we need the new influx of people so that becomes more widespread and and gain much more recognition as legitimate currency in the meantime though we are all secretly hiding in the corner saying my precious my precious over and over again

My guess is that all the alts are being dumped to trade into Bitcoin which is going up in value. This is a temporary effect in my opinion period once things start to stabilize you'll see a spike and all the old markets again.
