I've used BTC to pay at a rock climbing gym called Vertical Dreams in NH as well, which has gyms in Manchester and Nashua.
@_date: 2013-05-24 02:45:49
I used to go there 2-3 times a week back when it was Boulder Mortys. I've been trying to get back into climbing, but all of my usual climbing buddies have completely different schedules than I do.
I was really surprised when I saw that sticker. People I talk to don't see the value in Bitcoin and think it's useless. Now I have one more reason to go there :)

Get a light wallet like Electrum if you don't want to wait for it to sync, which downloads the entire blockchain to your PC. Light wallets connect to a server that has the blockchain on it.

I know to be verified on CampBX I would have to provide ID and a bill, but I'm not sure about Dwolla. I was able to link my bank account and they notified me that a deposit would be made in a couple days to verify it.
The bill part is tricky because I'm 19 and live with my parents and they pay for most things and whatever I have to pay for I give them money for. I don't have any bills coming to my name so if that's the case then I don't know what i'll do...

Indoor rock climbing. Unfortunately nobody else around me takes bitcoin and i don't use it for online shopping.
@_date: 2013-05-23 23:13:55
Done. Thanks for the suggestion.

Maybe some legal stuff like buying items from legitimate sites such as bitmit, bitspend, pizzaforcoins, etc. also how it benefits merchants by having no fees or a small fee with bitpay.

Wasn't bitcoin like $30 a couple months ago?
Therefore it went up 300% in a couple months.
Maybe it needs some correction because the media hype pushed it past where it should be. Human psychology plays a major part in trading and prices.

About 3 days
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:27:38
I agree.
It's the easiest platform I've tried so far.
Everyone else but the people who fulfill my orders should go away :P

Services like bitpay convert them directly to cash for a much smaller fee than credit card companies would charge for using credit cards if OP doesn't want to risk keeping the bitcoins.

Bitcoin's value comes from its scarcity and supply/demand. When supply is up/demand goes down, the price goes down. If supply is down/demand goes up, the price goes up.
The value comes from how much people want it and how many of them are out there.
There may be more questions like this or answers on if you still have unanswered questions.

People could buy bitcoins and send/transfer them to another exchange

For testing DDoS protection, would it be possible to announce a time and date on here and have a bunch of people fire up LOIC at the same tiime?
Not sure of the legality of that, but if it's approved of by the site being DDoSed then I don't see a problem.
Oh, and if you do this you should probably announce a duration that the DDoS would be for.

Created an account at CampBX and Dwolla. Can't wait for my bank account to be verified at Dwolla!
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:31:16
Yes there is. Unfortunately i have no way to write to it at the moment but it's still cool. It seems like it will hold up nicely.

If you quit smoking you'd get rid of that cough

You say not to trust random people on the Internet, yet to me, you're a random person on the Internet.
So if you say I shouldn't trust random people should I trust that statement coming from a random person, or should I not trust it?
Seriously, though, great points. I second the notion of using two-factor authentication. It takes a couple seconds to launch an app that could save you big time overall.
I'd also suggest not getting caught up in the hype on here. People that were caught up in the hype and bought in before the crash are probably regretting it. Make your own judgements based on what you think will happen.
Another huge one is only to put in what you can afford to lose. If you can only afford to lose 50 bucks, only put that amount in. Although it may seem like it will pay off, nothing is certain, so assume all money you put in will be lost.
Then again, this is coming from a random person on the Internet :P
Edit: didn't see that the thread was about security, so this comment may be a bit off-topic. Carry on.

I use it to get money into CampBX
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:18:06
And I was excited to get my 3d printed bitcoin in the mail..
Nice buy, OP.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:14:01
have fun predicting when it will burst and letting go exactly before it does
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:37:10
New Hampshire, USA. Forgot to mention that.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:07:40
Nobody will know. It may drop down to $50, it might rebound to over $200. Threads like this just cause more panic and hype that drives the price further down.
@_date: 2013-06-18 05:03:18
I think that's only for new accounts. I got in before that, but haven't used it since so idk if I'll have to wait for my next deposit or not.

How do you determine what a swear is? Some words may be swears to some, but not others. I don't consider crap or darn swears, but someone else might.
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:07:12
Are the prices on there before or after the 15-20% off?
@_date: 2013-06-05 16:29:04
Btc-e lets you trade ltc for usd or btc. Btc can be traded for ltc or usd as well. I believe there is support for other alt coins as well.
@_date: 2013-06-15 01:26:01
Any updates?
Has anyone received their order yet?
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:39:56
I thought you had to be 21 to buy pistol ammo, however, the website says you have to be 18.
I guess they cover it by adding "certify that you are at least 18 years old and satisfy your jurisdiction’s legal requirements to purchase this product."
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:29:16
My first experience with bitcoin was donating to them.
My second was buying a 3d-printed bitcoin :P
