The market cap is actually in a great place if you stand back and look at the big picture. We're in bear season. Just like in spring/summer 2017 we're having a slight withdraw before the big run up. I bet you(seriously thinking about a long play) that by December the cap will be 400b to 500b at it's peak which should be around Christmas. And that's being conservative. I would say higher but it's just hard to fathom it going higher than that just like in 2015 it was impossible to fathom it would go higher than 1 or 2 billion.

No he's not right about what he said. He didn't say pull out now and come back later. He said Pull out permanently and don't invest in crypto at all until the government makes their own which is an ignorant way to look at crypto.   
Secondly pulling out now isn't necessarily the best idea cause there's really no way to know if we're at the bottom yet. We could be bullrunning up in the next couple weeks actually.

He's the real Wolf of Wall Street that Leo played. He spends most of his time talking shit about bitcoin and it bothers me just letting off some steam. Had no idea I would get so many replies.I kinda regret posting now...

That's why Hodling or longing it is probably best during bear season. Even if it is manipulated I'm not too concerned. In the long run it should keep going up but that being said there's other coins I like more like Ether and Trx etc. but I still think Btc has another big run up left in it.
