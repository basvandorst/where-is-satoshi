I'm fairly new to bitcoin and I'm not very tech savvy so I can definitely understand why you'd find this so overwhelming. You've been given some really good advice about how to find the bitcoin and keep it safe but if you want to learn how to sell it in a safe and reliable way I recommend watching some YouTube tutorials. Also, if you have any trouble following the instructions on this thread there are lots of step-by-step tutorials on YouTube that will guide you through it. Take your time and watch a few videos from different sources so you can figure out who is credible/helpful and who is just a shill or a scam. 
Lastly, I don't know what your financial situation is but this is probably the worst possible time to sell the bitcoin because the price is much lower than normal. If you can, I suggest you take the time to learn about bitcoin and it's potential value in the foreseeable future. That way if you decide to sell it you'll be making an informed decision. You should also learn about the different exchanges so you can  sell it without getting ripped off. I'm so sorry for your loss.

Really? That’s awesome! Where r u from? It doesn’t work that way in Australia. I think there should be a time limit or something. If you buy ETH and trade it for an alt coin within a few hours then it’s pretty obvious that you’re not investing in ETH.

As I said b4, CoinTracking.info is really expensive, it’s still in beta, and it only works for a handful of exchanges. Some .csv files work better than others but you’ll still have to do a lot of manual inputs and the inconsistencies can create a lot more trouble than it’s worth. If you set up a spreadsheet that records all the relevant info and update it whenever you buy/sell something, you’ll save yourself a lot of time and money.

That’s really expensive, it only works on some exchanges, and it doesn’t keep track of all the relevant info (eg capital expenses). You’ll still have to add a lot of information manually so you might as well just update your own records as you buy/sell.

That’s fine if you just trade fiat for crypto or crypto for fiat. But if you’ve been using crypto to buy/sell alt coins then it’s way more complicated (assuming you live in one of the countries I mentioned).

Exactly. That’s why I want an efficient record keeping system in place before shit gets too out of hand.

What about the capital gains/losses incurred when you buy some random shit coin with ETH? That’s a CGT event so you have to report that shit on your annual tax return. You can’t just tick a box that says ‘hodl’.

lol I was totally joking about the baby thing. Just saw that part of the debate and spat coffee all over my keyboard. I didn't think he could possibly say anything more deranged than when he compared bcash to a racial slur but he always finds a way to level up.

Oh dw, I'm not that much of a newb. I know a~ll about Roger. I think 'Crypto Justice Warrior' (CJW) is a more apt description. I came up with it after he said that calling BCH "bcash" was like using a racial slur XD

Thx. I worked out that I can increase the fee. It’s all good now
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:40:32
Thanks. I'll check out that video later. Based on what you've said, it sounds like "blockweight" an apt metaphor as opposed to a literal description. Is that correct? 
I haven't watched Wright's presentation yet but I'm sure it'll have the same BS smell as everything else he's ever said.

Thanks for the explanation. I don't think Roger Ver is an enemy of bitcoin. He has a lot of skin in the game and his motives seem sincere...I think he's probably just be a fucking lunatic. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:17:20
Oh, this is perfect. Thank you!

I can’t tell if you’re trolling me or just giving an answer that I can’t wrap my head around. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:57:59
Okay, that actually kinda makes sense...Quick follow up question: are babies dying because of segwit or LN? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:47:43
Lol Fair enough. I realise I’m wearing the reddit equivalent of a ‘kick me’ sign on my back but it’s still the quickest way to get a simple answer.

What are the current transaction times like? I’ve been waiting for over an hour and still unconfirmed. I thought this issue had been resolved.
