It's called freedom of speech, something you whiney babies wouldn't know anything about.

He also claimed Bitcoin Cash will soon just be called "cash", but you don't see bankers flipping out calling him a fraud. Sure, its a bold assumption to assume it will take over Bitcoin, but it could happen nonetheless.
It's interesting how a centralized, mob-mentality, group-think community is so up-in-arms and possessive over a project that was meant to be decentralized.

Bets on how long until this comment chain is deleted by mods? Doubt I'll have time to make popcorn.

So if the miners, i.e. the hashpower, leaves a chain and that chain becomes unusable, the market will stay?

Be happy in your little echo-chamber then. Freedom of thought and speech be damned!

I can see that, I suppose they shouldn't be concerned or influencing price. Miners should be the determining factor of which chain wins, not the markets. The markets will follow.

I am missing the implication as well. Perhaps it is because I am not super biased in the matter...

That still means we will be coming down to around $1500 easy?

The problem is blatant bias is leading to an artificially high occurrence of "low-quality" posts. His argument is not whether the sub should maintain a certain quality posts, just that opposing views and opinions aren't filtered out under the guise of "low-quality."

Not sure that is a comparable example. What even is Virgin X, Virgin Galactic? In that case you would be referring to Space X not Tesla.

Unlike most the posts here, I agree with you 100%. People are disillusioned after a 2 year bull market, but no market can sustain these numbers forever. I think a correction to $5,000-$4,750 is likely by the month's end and possibly to around $2,000 after a 1-3 year bear market.
