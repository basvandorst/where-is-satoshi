Just don't buy anything that needs plugging in to an outlet.

I'm wondering this too. Every time I tried sending bitcoins to an address I waited over half an hour for 3 confirmations.

I don't think anything can be recovered from a single pass. Theoretically there are slight differences but in practice I don't think anyone can do it.

Oh god I made the mistake of telling my parents, THEY TELL EVERYONE.

Similar thoughts. I'm thinking now must be a good time to sell, but who the fuck knows the future.

I'm so tempted to sell right now. Not going to, because it's not life-changing or anything, but... damn.

I would like an app that notifies me when BTC value is lower than X dollars/euros/... , or higher than Y.

I would love to see her reaction too. Please film it if it's not too late. I can just imagine a "what have you been up to" smile turning into a "oh my god what have you done" look.

It's a different paradigm. Except for Nexus devices, Google doesn't control the hardware and so it's up to each manufacturer to provide updates to their devices. This allows a bazillion different devices out there and has the drawback that most of them don't run the latest versions of the OS.
IMO It's still much much better than Apple's ~~prison~~ walled garden.

He meant it's rat poison for investors.
