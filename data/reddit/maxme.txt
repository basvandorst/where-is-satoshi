So in Kenya, banks fail because "Bankers craft ways to enrich themselves and their friends with depositors money in the full knowledge that they will never be caught." and because the governement is either helpless or partner in crime.
That's funny because if developed countries disabled safety nets for banks, they would fail the same way.

So much this! I've been following this sub for years and nowadays it's only memes, moons, crashes, price predictions and people whining.

Idea is very interesting but:
1. The game is horrible (slow, poor graphics and animations, on my second game I was stuck with a half of the board empty).
2. Prize are not interesting, I don't want to play to win $0.001, would be cool to deposit some btc to an account an play against other players (and of course, the game should be super hard to hack...)

No worries, excepted bitcoin users, no one will see this video. He can tell any nonsense, we're the only audience, that makes his talk even funnier ;)

I never touched their money, they put fiat or bitcoins on MtGox by themselves.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:16:18
Yes, I'm using it, and I'm still making profits thanks to it. But I keep minimal amount of money on exchanges, and I've blacklisted some of them (mtgox was one of them).

They could only buy the fraction of Bitcoin which is on the markets. That's the tip of the iceberg.

Yep, I'll probably never reply to those emails.

Or BIP 38 cold wallets for free. Print your encrypted private keys, duplicate them to protect them. If something bad happens (ie someone has access to your encrypted private keys), then move them to a new wallet. No need for a vault, but a good passphrase and having several copies in different places is key.
Of course, you have to know what you're doing... And if bitcoin goes mainstream, 99% of users won't know how to do that, they'll probably pay someone to do it for them.

Oh, and why they should not ?

According to  with your 5830 you can mine at ~300Mh/s
Using this calculator  at current difficulty, assuming you consume 400W and assuming you already have the hardware (0 investment cost). At current exchange rate ($14/BTC) you should make $57.43 - $43.83 (electricity cost) = $13.60 the first month

I really want to buy some Pata Negra from your shop, but your site is not ready from prime time: you should trim the prices, show shipment methods and price, avoid having 3 different prices from the same item, etc. (lots of stuff you're probably aware of).
And one question, why not open bazaar?

It's fun to watch Pirate Pass Through bonds prices in GLBSE going up and down since last week at each "anouncement" in bitcointalk forums.

Yeah, they might be able to empty a few ATMs, which is far from being a bank run.
@_date: 2016-10-04 14:48:24


Just for the record, at the current rate of 1 BTC = 617.03 USD:
81 * 10000 satoshis = 810000 / 100 000 000 * 617.03 = 4.99 USD.
And yes Kim Dotcom was convicted of insider trading, I wouldn't not trust him to touch my precious satoshis.

I agree with you, to me Bitcache is nothing but hot air, and he's just trying to get the money. He has some dark background and even if I believe he has interests in Bitcoin going to the moon, I think he's just willing to scam another group of people. And this time no one will be able to seize that money.
@_date: 2016-10-11 07:22:53
He tries hard to get the money:  - but still far from its target.
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:50:20
From bnktothefuture:


So if condition is not met, I guess the campaign fails and Bitcache won't be backed this way. I won't be surprised if this limit change tho, or if they start a new lower threshold campaign right after the first failure.

Thanks, I know it's easy to trade with API on most of markets, but honestly I don't trust my code enough yet ;)
I'm watching mtgox, intersango and bitcoin-central (only in euro).

I'm working on making config more human. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 16:22:49
There is a traderbot simulator in the repo (  )
I ran it for a week on 4 markets: MtGox, BitcoinCentral, Bitcoin24 Intersango. It starts with 500€ and 15BTC on each exchanges. (~ 4000€ total)
Taking into account transaction fees on some market and the fact you can't move EUR from a market to another, it made +250€. That means, at the end of the simulation you still have your 60 BTC and 2000€ distributed differently on different markets plus 250€.
This simulation is quite close to reality, the main difference: in reality when you buy or sell, you make the market move.
I'm currently writing tests for it. I will not run it with real bots before these tests.
@_date: 2013-08-03 14:33:58
Yes exactly, with investment point of view, it's what you describe.
But it's sad to see it only as *very fluctuant auction*. There is so much behind it.

Previous version was able to "cross" currencies by get a USD/EUR conversion rate. This version doesn't, but it's in the TODO list.
In fact it does with bistamp since you can buy BTC quoted in USD with EUR...

I already have those games but still bought a bundle - you should have an option to gift it.

@_date: 2013-08-03 13:33:13


You mean sell them ? Yes, when exchanges are not blocked or super-slow  for withdrawal (currently mtgox for instance).
@_date: 2013-08-03 13:24:27
Investing in bitcoin, I think this is not a good idea, it could be $0 or $1000 in 6 months, nobody knows. Big risks (government could block all exchanges) and big opportunities (bitcoin companies could take part of Paypal market share).
But if you like the idea behind it and want to be part of the future, yes buy bitcoins now and use them to buy goods and services (reddit gold ? wordpress premium ? humblebundle ? bitcoinstore.com ? bitmit.net ?).
@_date: 2013-03-17 10:21:13
This is the main problem
@_date: 2013-01-31 15:54:37
Yes I did, but with very small amounts. It's not a bot, so you have to do the operation manually. My code is missing one _important_ thing: market depth on these opportunities (ok, sometime you can make +6% easily, but only on 0.1BTC...)
I'm trading in euros, but it's the same problem with usd. Moving euros from a market to another it's very long and can be costly. And I don't have money to invest in this, so I can't do "shallow operations".
So I had to wait for symmetrical buy/sell opportunities, for instance: I buy 10BTC on mtgox, transfer 10BTC to bitcoin central, sell 10BTC then wait for a superior sell price on mtgox. In fact, this kind of situation often happens when volatility is high and because "small" markets doesn't move fast.
@_date: 2013-08-03 14:20:52
Yes, but it still a high risk "investment". I'm a bitcoin user, I have bitcoins , I believe in bitcoins. But I think this should not be used as an investment.
When I give my friends a bitcoin or two, I don't say: "Wait a year and you could sell them for $1000 each". I say: "Install Electrum and use them, you'll see how you can buy things online without Bank/Paypal/VISA/Mastercard"

One main reason: library knowledge
I wanted to write a watcher, I though it could take me 20 lines of code and 1 hour for writing and testing. I know the Python library very well, and I don't have to read the doc to know how to HTTP Get data, parse JSON, Write data, and send an email.
I don't have this knowledge of Scala or JS/Node standard libs.

EDIT: fix URL
@_date: 2013-08-03 14:18:08


Yes sorry, let say $0.1


I didn't say it would kill bitcoin. But as investment (when you want to sell something for higher price than you've bought)... If mtgox, bitstamp and btce are down or any other main exchange go down, price will be much lower on remaining exchanges (or localbitcoin / otc). BTW this one example risk other risks exist.
@_date: 2013-08-08 08:29:42
