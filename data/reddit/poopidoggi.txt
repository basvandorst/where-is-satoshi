You're quite welcome.
*Trololol. I sent from a non-segwit address with a small fee to see how it would go out of curiosity. Definitely should have checked the number of unconfirmed transactions waiting first. Will resend if it doesn't go through :P

I would love for someone to show me how I can have a price/ticker on my w10 lock screen
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:32:56
Would love AUD
And why not put a little donate link or text down the bottom? Happy to send a little BTC your way when AUD is up and working :)
..and probably again if it could be an android widget..

I've used localbitcoins a lot before. Can reccommend.
I use coinjar when I'm working rural and can't get to a bank. I was genuinely concerned CBA would close my account after cashing a little out earlier this month.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:08:49
Awesome thank you!
Chuck me an address :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:38:51
I would almost commit my phones battery to such a thing :P
I spend most of my time at work around wifi so it wouldn't be that much of an issue. 
When it's out of wifi range, does it just show the price from the last update?
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:06:33
How long does it last not connected to power?
Could it be a bracelet?
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:11:49
I tried to find a blog post with more details but they just have their [documentation page](
I know people have mixed feelings about CoinJar but I have personally never had an issue with them and am proud to see Australian exchanges pushing forward and trying new things.
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:18:03
0 fees for the new Exchange until 30 June!
@_date: 2014-01-26 06:59:25
"educated every commenter"
"How do Bitcoins work?" "Magic."
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:20:25
Just grinning. No one would have said you were educating anyone if you weren't.
@_date: 2014-04-29 07:48:48
It's not on the site for me. In Australia, could be country limited?
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:21:58
Exact same response I got 6 months or so ago :\
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:57:09
Let us know how you go :) 
And good luck!
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:50:05
Can you make it sound magical whilst remaining factual?
I would like that :)
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:33:56
have you guys seen this? :)
@_date: 2018-06-03 09:17:10
I would love to get something but I'm a small female.
Like the idea though. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:03:53
No one can hear collective elation in space.
@_date: 2019-02-24 00:34:49
I've signed up. Am in Australia, will that be ok?
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:21:33
I'm in Aus. Happy to pay for shipping or get a discount maybe?
I just ran out of stickers :P
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:57:38
That's cool. I'm more interested in supporting you than getting things for free. I'll PM :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:42:44
I was just too lazy. It was at $250 when I could have cashed out and it seemed like a waste of time.
I'm super glad I was still able to retrieve them and now just have them sitting at Kraken waiting for BCash to start crashing so I can cash out.
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:51:25
With every new peak, more people are watching and hoping to get on at the right time so they don't miss out.
I feel that, as the price gains momentum, it'll just keep going as more and more people buy back in.
There will be a new wall or issue that stops us going any farther price-wise. As others have said, it may not be transaction fee/mempool related. But I imagine it'll keep going higher until we find out what the next obstacle is in the way of mass adoption.
I like these steps. High price and fast movement generates interest and investors. When it drops and settles we (the devs and community) find time to improve and innovate.
This is purely opinion/observation. I mostly just try to hold tight and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:33:05
This is me. even now they've already had plenty of time to ask questions, learn and be involved.
If I get bored when I'm older I may set up an elaborate scavenger hunt that results in finding a cache of Bcash
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:55:51
This x.x
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:22:30
I generally peg bitcoin-spenders to be able to suss that stuff out :)
@_date: 2013-06-21 00:45:35
I've never tried this. Sounds fun :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:53:12
I'm insanely happy. Being unemployed and poor is unfun. I'm going to have a mini christmas when my phone and pebble arrive!!
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:24:26
I just got my S4 too! So happy :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:35:17
both phone stores ship outside of the US..
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:02:57
Thats what I did when my $20 worth because $400 worth a year or so ago!
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:01:37
So true. I imagine some big tech nerds at the FBI were so keen to get onto this team/project.
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:23:54
I didn't see steamloader.com on any lists! Might have to swing back past there..
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:12:30
That sucks! I was getting so excited looking through your selection.
@_date: 2013-06-21 00:43:11
At least in Australia, this is pretty much it. Also why cash deposits are the big thing with Bitcoins.
Cash deposits are instant.
@_date: 2013-07-02 02:09:27
Is it too much to expect a single entity to collect data from a bunch of major exchanges and report an average price?
We could then base a lot of trade off of that average price?
@_date: 2013-06-21 05:03:25
Whoo! Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:29:38
Hey. The site says you're completely out now and down for a while. When will you be back with stock?
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:55:32
I did say "generally"..
Those people make me worry for bitcoin's future. But for now it's fun to be part of a semi-secret club :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:29:46
But that's what a "bad investment" is.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:45:11
Previous web dev and support experience. Would love to help in any way possible. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:51:59
Was that in response to my code/user errors?
My problems were one website having filler instead of shipping information, another site had an item i wanted that was missing dimensions and messing up going through checkout, another just crashed on me over and over again while i was trying to make my purchases.
100% no issues with bitcoin. I was laughing at how simple it was.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:01:08
Thank you, same to you! :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:28:59
Awesome. Now to see if I can afford it!
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:29:03
Some beautiful designs. Love them!
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:57:05
Any chance you're looking into expanding into Australia?
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:59:57
I love how Perth is opening to Bitcoin! Still have yet to head down to Biscotti but it's on my list :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:24:52
Theres no shipping info. Are you shipping internationally?
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:10:25
I'm currently losing. So I agree, I don't have that capacity x.x
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:45:06
Thank you! In the end I bought off btc-market. The code only arrived today, after the sale ended :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:07:54
Even a few dollars would be worth it? I could raid the couch for change :D
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:00:39
Will you be doing some sort of notification signup so that we can elect to be emailed when this happens? :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:12:12
Mining is out of the questions now as well isn't it?
