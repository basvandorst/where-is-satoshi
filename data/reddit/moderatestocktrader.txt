Thanks for the word. Ethereum is still up from last month even if it has dropped. I personally don't think that Bitcoin is going to make it for much longer, even with its lightning network and SegWit2x updates. There are more robust cryptos and blockchains/hashgraphs about and this technology will be pretty much ongoing.

What do you think about NEO? It has a proactive team with many departments that target both user case uses and enterprise uses. It being a Chinese created blockchain surely means it will capture a good portion of the market.

Hey I've only spent 2 real months in crypto but I need you guys opinion on something. How long do you think the Bitcoin hype can last? It's gone 10 years without major adoption as it pertains to what it was created for: a digital currency. 
I've only read up on it and a few other currencies briefly but it's apparent that Bitcoin is inferior tech and all other "generation one" crypto tech will be disposed of along with it.
I guess my question is how much media steam do you think Bitcoin has left? Maybe the implementation of lightning network and other sidechain development and that's it? I'll ride the hype 6 more months before I think it is too much of a gamble.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:53:59
And what makes lightning network the standard? Lmao, just give it up Bitcoin. The real best cryptocoin will be developed years from now.
Wait until then.

@_date: 2018-01-26 13:07:38
I hear that the devs have a 50% stake. Still, they have different departments working with businesses to solicit them to use their blockchain. How will the language barrier factor into crypto as it pertains to both businesses and the people? People may be more willing to adopt and do business with the blockchain that was started by their own people in their native language. I'm sure that Bitcoin is known and recognized globally but that doesn't mean that other blockchains can't gain marketshare whether their blockchain is public or private. A good solid advertising team and business experience cannot be discounted. IBM has a HyperLedger division and I'm sure that they will do business even if a company could just as easily develop a DApp on their own using ethereum.

This all seems so depressing for Bitcoin. Why didn't they implement all of this in August '17? This makes me want to look into Bitcoin Cash from a technical standpoint. Does BCC have segwit and LN implementation already?
Correct me if I'm wrong but Bitcoin is starting to feel antiquated and a name to me. The code is opensource though and it has a large amount of people on the network.
Do you think the developers can make it into something great when it comes to usage or functionality? Because the market cap is there. I just fear that people are going to be rushing to other cryptos that are more advanced with more robust use cases and benefits before/if anything gets done.

John McAfee brought up a good point that a mass hack of wallets will happen one day. He has a cyber security background and thought of it as simply as hackers who have access to devices in bulk will just collect wallet keys and wait. This may be happening currently on a small scale but now that I think about it, if a state actor or someone with access to a lot of devices were interested, they could issue a large transference of funds into several wallets of their own. This panic will cause the public to lose trust in Bitcoin for quite some time. Until the public is educated to use secure storage, crypto will have an iffy immediate future. It is not as if this stuff is backed by the FDIC or secured by gold in a secured vault.

I wouldn't think so. It would take way too much capital for American whales to move the bitcoin market. I don't think they would risk that type of capital in an unproven system. Besides, Bitcoin is global. One futures market in one country isn't enough to sway the price of a global commodity.

I've heard about lightning network since May '17. My memory is a bit fuzzy but it seems like people were saying it would have been implemented soon back then. Or maybe it was SegWit. Anyway, how long has lightning network been in development and are we closing in? How long until it's userfriendly and people can send their Bitcoin to each other effortlessly kind of like CashApp?

I mean, I guess. Still, you haven't addressed Bitcoin being an aging crypto with not much utility. There are already other cryptocurrencies out their with better functionality and use cases. Not to mention that most crypto is open source. Blockchain/ledger technology is in its infancy and it is still being developed. Why put your money in any crypto until they are actually providing you with utility? Am I wrong in thinking that more of the public is learning about blockchain more broadly and parking their money elsewhere if not backing out of this silly game completely?

Can you tell me more about your long-term thoughts when it comes to bitcoin? Will these developments keep it a major contender? Isn't it inevitable that a crypto or platform will take its place? How much can Bitcoin be developed on without having to hardfork?
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:18:29
It doesn't matter, this isn't enough to save Bitcoin. Other cryptos with more use cases will take over. If Bitcoin is like 3d printing then Ethereum is like 4d printing. You send a Bitcoin through cyberspace and it arrives at its destination. You send an ETH through cyberspace and it executes a contract a la 4d printer.

@_date: 2018-01-18 09:52:09
Thanks a lot. Bit by bit a few of the responses here are shaping my thoughts about Bitcoin. You addressed a major question, and I guess where all of my uncertainty comes from. The question of the development of the code. I only programmed a tiny bit when I was younger but I remember having to compile my code into an .exe after every little update. This means that all of the new changes were hardcoded in and the old exe was discarded. Can I think of Bitcoin like this? If an update or implementation is needed Bitcoin will have to "hardfork" into a new project and build on to the code or else it will have to have developments done in cooperation with the core bitcoin code? I.e. lightning network being developed on its own and will have to channel/interact with Bitcoin's core code?
I guess what I'm saying is Bitcoin's framework is rigid and can't be updated freely if it wanted to change major things without hardforking?
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:24:49

Hey, I've made the same exact post several times here. I'm getting information that broadens my view but nothing concrete. Bitcoin isn't being used for what it's designed for: currency! The real world infrastructure isn't in place yet for a seemless and convenient experience. 
It took me all but 20 hours or two real weeks to notice this so why the fanatics? As you mentioned, other coins have better prospects. Still, they are generation 1, too. The coin that will take all of the ingenuity of the coins that are out there has yet to exist. Not to mention all of the other variables that could impede crypto adoption if it ever were to exist.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:21:04

Bitcoin is a global "commodity". There are other countries with their own futures market, too. Japan for instance. Why are these CME threads popping up so frequently and why do people think that one single institution with 1400 contracts will be able to sway the price of a global investment vehicle that has a 600 billion market cap? Who do you think has 100 billion + to risk on an extremely hard to liquidate asset such as Bitcoin?

@_date: 2018-01-16 21:59:28
Now, do a chart of the overlap of another technology with inferior tech. Bitcoin is generation 1 AND open source so by logic it will not be around for long unless by hard fork. People will just develop on the code and make better cryptocurrencies and technologies with it. Why tell people to "hold" onto something that by its very nature is suppose to be circulated or spent? Are you ignorant or are you just trying to make sure with absolute certainty that you will get out of your position at a better price?

I mean yes, but someone is going to get majorly burnt with this line of thinking. Everyone thinks it wont be them and that they are an early adopter. My simple point is that cryptocurrency isn't designed to be held. It's literally in the name: crypto*currency*. I wouldn't be advising anyone's grandma to be buying it as an investment when the truth is that all cryptos of today will be generation 1 and obsolete before you know it.

What do you think of Dash? I've only taken a cursory look at crypto and have not spent much time researching it. Maybe 20 hours or two real world weeks.
In the context of your post, Dash has a team of developers and marketers as well as other in-house departments. It's a developmental project being ran by traditional company rules. It also has a limit of only 18 million coins being possible. It seems that Dash incentivizes people better through staking and nodes that will inturn benefit the system. It has a simple, brandable name for American and English speaking markets, too.
The only drawback I can think of with my limited knowledge is that it hasn't been securely tested as well as Bitcoin.

The centralization is in the miners and if they will still be here once Bitcoin becomes too difficult to mine. All cryptos are experimental. This is a nascient technology.

Ethereum's smart contracts make it much more robust than Bitcoin already, without having to trade anything so come again?

Eh, is it though? On-chain scaling sounds like it would be the most ideal. Isn't that the point? An immutable ledger?

They go about it by proposing BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). If they are voted on by the majority then they get implemented, if not then the developer has the freedom to take the Bitcoin code and hard fork. This means that he took the existing Bitcoin code and added his improvements to it. The new code is compiled and a new blockchain (fork) is created that is validated by new clients and new nodes. Miners and anyone in the community that like the changes made to the protocol have the freedom to use the new forked coin. They also have the freedom to contribute to its development under the new community (and viewpath).

And what makes you think we will get over this HODLer hurdle and head into adoption? Surely everyone will cash out or exchange expensive goods for their coins at strategic waves and price points - causing the price to plummet. Once the price plummets, they will double dip with even more capital to do it again. What do you think will break this cycle and give adoption the leeway to take the lead?
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:23:23
I think that 1-3 are all possible regardless of each other. As far as the 2018 high and low I think $12k will be the high and $3k will be the low.

It sounds good but you are not taking into account the popularity of Bitcoin by the year, the market cap and the price. For instance Bitcoin may have gained 20% in 2012 but that 20% was only 40 million dollars worth of capital. That is because the market cap was 140 mil. Market cap divided by shares = price. So, it was much easier for the price of Bitcoin to go from $200 a coin/share to $240 a coin/share than it is for Bitcoin to go from $8,000 a coin/share to $10,000 a coin/share. It would take 10 billion worth of capital in the second example. People are already burned, so who exactly is going to buy Bitcoin now to boost it up? 
Edit: my numbers are off but whatever

That's an interesting loop that you've presented. I can't argue with it unless you include intent. If you give due to kindness and not due to admiration and good feelings then you could be treaching into altruism. Also, what about sacrifice? The end of the definition of altruism speaks about selflessness. I've often given or helped and not thought of self. I've been in 8 years of low income and debt due to altruism actually. It doesn't feel good at a certain degree and a certain level.

You gotta realize them gains is what I've learned. I have never bought cryptocurrency so I don't know how easy it is to liquidate. In the stock market, you can set a dollar amount or percent amount stop loss order. This will sell your holdings in case of a crash. With a currency as volatile as Bitcoin it's tougher to set but it makes sense to do so. My strategy when I do buy cryptocurrency is to put a sell order for a 11% drop once I am up 30% or more. Once my coins drop to that 11% I will force myself to stay out of the market for a few weeks just to observe and then slowly add my money back in.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:51:18
I don't know to be sure. I would have to do more analysis. I just threw out a comfortable number. I would need to refresh my memory on last year's run. The number that I remember Bitcoin being at before its massive run was like $3k. It started trippling and gaining percentage crazy at certain points in there. I would have to think what point was the most natural.
I would also have to compare market cap by $k value. It's much easier to move from $6k-$12k in price because it requires a smaller amount of dollars. Let's say the market cap is at $50 billion at $6k. It will take another $50 billion dollars to get the price to $12k (double).  If the price has to double again from $12 to $24k then it will take $100 billion more dollars which would be harder to do.
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:10:01
Bitcoin has consolidated at 10-11k, hallelujah! Now, all I have to do is monitor volume and news (advertising). CNBC has been shilling Bitcoin like crazy (as usual). This may or may not be indicative of an emerging bull market. I am finally feeling positive about Bitcoin again.
I have one nagging feeling in the back of my mind though. I believe that Bitcoin should have crashed a bit harder. Maybe to $3-$4k. Perhaps it will crash again once it reaches $16-$17k to feed my prophet-like whims.
Another thing I may not be factoring in completely is just the sheer scope of a global "commodity". In the stock market they Issue American depository receipts over-the-counter to represent shares of a foreign company; unless you deal with an international broker to get shares directly. The instant pump of 100's of countries converting fiat into Bitcoin could be a beast I am not equipped to wrap my head around.
All this to say that I'm feeling bullish about Bitcoin!

I agree, Bitcoin will end up just being the world's hobby. First worlders delude themselves in thinking that Bitcoin solves some problem for them. Paying with Bitcoin is like paying with a topped up prepaid. What's the incentive for the average joe who already has a debit card, visa, venmo etc.? 
Some real use cases are electric (psuedo-anonymous) cash and global payments and remittances. Global payments and remittances are a great way to utilize Bitcoin to drastically reduce fees. We all know how expensive it is to use Western Union and they operate under tight margins.
I expect the market price to reflect these real use cases eventually. Everyone else is in the way.

So you are bullish on Bitcoin reaching $500,000 by 2020? I don't see it. A lot of major implementations will just have started finalizing by then. Once the tech is looking more viable for using, then you can begin incentivizing merchants and working on customer/population adoption. I don't see how that wont take another x years just to work out the volatility of Bitcoin and to get the public to feel confident in it again after this $20k crash.

*Blockchain tech is ideal for these kinds of uses, because the info can be entered and saved, but not modified or erased in any way. That’s a key advantage over database based systems.*
My thoughts are that a blockchain can be used by singular companies to allow trust in their dealings with each other. Blockchains will allow a transparent and validatable system since no one company operates and maintains the data.
From another article related to shipping and blockchain implementation:
IBM and Maersk are using a blockchain built on the Hyperledger Fabric to manage the supply chain for container shipping.
*Traditionally, a simple shipment of refrigerated goods from East Africa to Europe can go through nearly 30 people and organizations, including more than 200 different interactions and communications among them, said the IBM announcement.*
*Using digital records and a blockchain can sharply reduce costs, although the actual savings won’t be known for a year or two until the blockchain is more widely used.*
*Ramesh Gopinath, IBM’s vice president of blockchain research, said all the documents for shipping containers can be fully digitized and the containers can be tracked. In the September POC, the shipping cost $2,000 and the paperwork could be about $300, or 15 percent of the cargo’s value.*

I share your exact sentiment and I was surprised when Bitcoin went back up to $10-$12k after the drop. I was too dumb to arbitrage the first few weeks of volatility. Mainly because I thought/think $9k was too high to touch. I'd be more comfortable getting in at a lower $5-$6k range and forgetting about the money for a few years.

I still haven't come up with a definitive answer to that but keep in mind that Bitcoin has been around the longest and has the biggest open source community. All of the other coins haven't been stressed tested as well as Bitcoin. This gives developers and users supreme confidence in Bitcoin because it's proven to be secure.

I'm 32 so cheers to me making it 2 1/2 years to the point that you are at now. The only drawback so far is that it's a bit expensive currently. I will have to go over my siblings and family members' houses and learn how to prepare similar dishes cheaply and in bulk. I agree with you about the distinction between what we call pets being off limits but docile creatures such as cows are fair game. It speaks to the psyche. I would also add things like glue traps are so immoral that it lead me to view things briefly as a terrorist. Thoughts like "how would you like it if I stuck you to a surface indefinitely and let you tear apart your flesh in an attempt to get loose?" People often reply with things like "rats are filthy and disease ridden! F*ck them!" It's as people are incapable of compassion or rational thought. The only thing separating us from rats and rodents is something like .01% of DNA code.

Bitcoin $6k. It might settle lower than that even. For those of you who have never monitored stock tickers this may be new to you. Whoever sold Bitcoin down to 10k has now been arbitraging for over a month now. First from 10 to ~14k and now from 8 to 9k or from 8 to 10k which is a greater percentage than from 10 to 14.
Expect maybe one more round or this last $9k pump to be the end of the day trade pattern. It will then trickle down to $6kish or below while the most clever traders are done with their risks and as the noobs here are done being burnt buying at their $7k-$8k "discounts".

Bitcoin should be closer to $1000 to be honest. I will have to research further to find out why it got boosted to this level. The answers in that recent "why did Bitcoin get to this price all of a sudden" thread weren't very convincing. As far as my memory and sources allow, Bitcoin started a massive run after the Aug, 2017 hard fork. I can't think of any other factors except CNBC, MSNBC and CNN going on about it as well as the introduction of Bitcoin futures. I will have to view more foreign sources to gauge what the sentiment was back then. I just don't see any major catalyst last year that would have boosted Bitcoin from $900 to $20k. $10k is a stretch tbh. I feel like someone just has their funds sitting on the base layer and they are just siphoning off from each new buy and taking the fiat profit.
What real catalysts do you guys remember from last year that was major to the point of moving BTC from $900 to $20,000? Don't give me that fear of missing out nonsense either. That only works in smaller percentages or amounts. People will see something gaining 20-30% and then they will say "I better get in on this!" When something is reaching astronomical levels they think "oh, that's too high. I'm not sure if I will buy." Maybe that's just my thinking though because obviously people were buying at $20k so I don't know.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:28:02

I think that this is a reasonable critic. I haven't kept up with my technical background in 10 years but I don't think decentralized file storage will be all that worthwhile. Maybe it will for a few cases such as sensitive data but I can only see it in a volunteer fashion i.e. wikipedia or archive.org. How will a decentralized network get over hurdles like latency and uptime?
The developer issue can be a strength depending on how you look at it. I believe that open source and collaborative efforts bring together great ingenuity. I agree that it allows for a lot of politics though. 
Private companies traditionally want control and ownership of things. This is where blockchain gets tricky. Companies would much rather issue their own tokens and hide or secure their own data with as much authority and as little oversight as possible. The problem is that defeats the purpose of decentralization. A blockchain needs to be decentralized and transparant to remain trustless. I think that companies will grasp this idea eventually and stop trying to make their own coins and settle on a public blockchain for their use case. I think that this could be major and spur collaborative efforts in fields despite competition.
As far as the lost keys part, I am sure there could be insurance agencies put in place. Either through entities or code (smart contracts).
I don't know much about the legal field and how it will react to blockchain or smart contracts. I will just have to see how it goes. Blockchains will have to have a long, secure and trusted history while being heavily used to dictate how far the law will validate them imo.

To expound on my other comment, people with capital buy an asset once it bottoms out. If you noticed, there hasn't been much buying over the last 2 days. Someone will throw in a couple million to stimulate things and other big dogs will follow suit. Once they shoot the price up a good 20% then they will sell. The reason is that they know there will be a seller on the other end trying to recoupe their losses. The seller bought at $10k and was very depressed and considered selling the first time the price hit $7k. The price dropped to $6k and they got even more upset. Now that the price is at $7k again the seller will rush to sell and the big dogs and clever traders will have taken their profits. 
Expect the price to go back down to $6k then below after this.

As another person said, let's not forget who the bad guys are here. In this case, Bitcoin is just a medium. It's innate. People can just as easily host foul stuff on regular websites, and probably do. Do you then go after those ISPs or website hosters? No, you contact them and request logs and hunt down who is truly responsible. Most of the time I'm willing to suspect that the website hosters are more than happy to collaborate with the police (if they were found not likely to be the culprit by the police and cleared.) The same goes for node operators.
Another thing is that I think that by "these images are hosted on the blockchain" people may think they are in plain view. No, they are just text so you would have to have an encoder to piece the data back together. Most people wouldn't even know if they were by chance looking at one piece of the blockchain that was tainted.
Edit: oh wow, I just assumed that this was the article about people using tools to encode/decode images directly into the blockchain. Not people actually linking hyperlinks. My point still stands though that the node hosters are safe unless they are found responsible. Still, who wants to run accross that stuff if they just happen to click on a link. Maybe ban hyperlinks in the OP_RETURN?

I find it funny how Bitcoin's price did the exact same as the stock market price of BTC related companies lol. Only it took 4 months for the coin to settle this low whereas BTC stock companies crashed out in 1-2 months. The stock market wipes you out quick. I'm down 60%. The BTC stocks I traded like MGTI, HSSHF, BTCS all had crazy volatility like Bitcoin has had these 3-4 months before they stagnated down to a new low. This is why I was telling people to hold out on buying at 8-9k but no I'm spreading FUD.

D'oh. But do you know when it was aired?

Lol. Nice year in your username however.

I'm deeply interested in the feud of Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash. I will have to do more research. Early on it was so confusing hearing about "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin Cash". I still cringe when I hear "f Roger Ver" or some ad hominem attack about Bitcoin Cash or their developers. Unless they really deserve it? From what little I know, it seems like there was just a disagreement about how to proceed further but it seems like the reaction is one of a nasty divorce. It's very hard for me to get the facts together about this. Guess I'll have to visit archive.org or read old reddit threads.

$6k-$7k is a good price. Anything under $10k is, really, IMO. I just think that it's going to take some time. I really need to let this "hobby" go for a little while and comeback around 2019.
Not to get too off topic but there are other investments that are better suited to be looked into now that Bitcoin's price has dropped. Checking the price daily is just addicting.

I see now. Bitcoin's price will continue to go down in the interim. Meanwhile, investors and whales will buy up Ethereum. They will then hail Ethereum as a major improvement over Bitcoin (keep in mind your average person doesn't know about Ethereum, only Bitcoin.) Ethereum's price will skyrocket then they will sell. Around this time MAST, RSK, etc. will have been implemented. They will then rotate their Ethereum profits back into Bitcoin and talk about how Bitcoin has these capabilities now too. This will gain them double profits and by this time most alt coins will have failed. Adoption should begin shortly after.

What he won't tell you is that he left his crypto and Bitcoin mining operation ("MGT Capital Investments") and left his shareholders holding the bag.

Oh, enlighten me then. The only thing I'll admit to is that it's foolish of me to try to explain or predict the market. Especially since I don't have Big Data analytics or a firm's backing. There are players that do, though.

Did you even watch the video? Specifically the last section?

I think that Bitcoin is still a bit inflated. That aside, I think that it is hard to gauge bubbles during these times. This is because of the massive influx of wealth into the hands of the few these last few decades. This means that much more money has to go into investment vehicles: stocks, bonds, real estate etc. The rich just has too much money for it to sit idle so we see the value of markets steadily increase.
