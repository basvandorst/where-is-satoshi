yea i guess, the problem is the currently high transaction fee. As long as the fee keeps high, other alt-coins will be there to jump in as needed, thats called free 
 (or in this case fee market :)) market i guess.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:06:45
do you really think, someone currently does by purpose flood the network? With  10 dollar transaction fees and only 1000 transactions per block this would be more then 1.000.000 dollar per day to spam the network...
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:01:40
in the longer run store of value alone is not enough if cant transfer it. with fees 10 dollar higher, it does not make sense to store 100 dollars in it, except on centralized exchanges / wallets, what again promotes centralization. 
Why cant we agree to increase the blocksize to a level that still enables full transparency and censorship resistance? 10 MB should be runnable on average computers. If Thor is the bottleneck, ok, let us figure out how high the block size could be to be able to run behind Thor. But why on earth we stick with 1MB?

thx, i think i will follow your advice at least partly, even if i dont consider any other subs my sub. there is also tons of shit in other subs, i guess to discuss something on Reddit is as pointless as it is pointless to hope for an increase in the block-size in the next... years?
I wish you all a happy new year, and i really hope that something like lightning will be the future, hopefully this future will come before it is too late for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:36:32
thank you for your more detailed answer. Funny, just in this moment i again read a great blockpost about the risk of mining centralization because of block propagation here: 
In short: I dont think that mining centralization is a big issue below 10 MB blocks. First of all we must look not at all, but on the mining nodes how long it would take to propagate a block between them. Second with current optimizations in place a miner would only need to download the missing transactions from a block not the full block. Third, with header first miners could already start mining on the block once they received the header, and later verify the block. Most likely miners do that yet already.
Finally if mining centralization is a problem, then we really should worry about the current reality with having few if not one asic producer control over the industry. This i guess will go worse in the future, as long as we stay with proof of work, or dont finance open source asics. 
Yea i guess the problem is, in the end someone has to take some risk. if we do nothing, there is a risk, if we do something there is a risk. The problem is, that in case of doing nothing the risk is somehow not so much personal, but in case of doing something the risk to mess something up gets very personal.
 
So developers tent to be less risk taking in this case. In old school businesses this kind of decision making risk are normally taken by people, which are more familiar with this kind of risk taking.
Honesty, currently i feel the first time since im involved in Bitcoin since beginning 2011 that we risk too loose our first mover advantage. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:19:43
i didnt say that i dont believe in spam transactions. Its just if someone is ready to pay 10 to 20 dollar per transaction either the transaction must have some purpose other then spam, or our system is broken because it allows to be too easy to be spammed. 10 dollar per transaction would mean that we would have more then 1.000.000 dollar per day to scale up our infrastructure if we do it right.

@_date: 2018-01-08 11:03:09
we did and yet we have an current increase of 10% through Segwitt with doubling the users currently every year...
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:29:10
Segwitt changed lot of code, it also changed how transaction data and witness data is priced. If the goal would be just to solve transaction malleability, there would be (as far as i know) more simple solutions like making one transaction format the standard. If bitcoin cash would follow this simple approach i dont know.  
Their argument is also, that they dont want to encourage to use off chain solutions, because they think it will lead to centralization of lightning hubs.
As always, most likely the truth is in the middle. To artificially limit on chain transactions will lead to centralization because of high fees. too much on chain scaling will lead to centralization because of high node requirements.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:53:30
first off all there is as far a i know no coin yet existing that is called Bcash. If you talk about  then the point is, to scale on chain as much as currently possible.
Currently the block-size can be increased to 10 MB without running into much trouble with nodes that have an average computation and bandwidth capacity. There are tests (if i remember them right), that show that with some minor optimizations the block size could be increased to 100 MB on normal available hardware.
That said, even if technically this would be possible, it would have some side effects like for example that nodes behind Thor could maybe not handle this traffic (i did not yet see any tests about that). This would therefore have the side effect, that nodes could theoretically be attacked more easily because  their ip is known.
On the other side  people argue that the best protection is to have more users that use it. The more it use the more difficult to shut it down. 
The current Bitcoin core developers (some left that wanted to increasing the block-size with a hard-fork) decided not yet to increase the block-size even if technical possible. The reasons for that as far as i understood is mainly because they dont want to change the system to drastically and prefer to use other scaling options and block-size optimizations first. Also the fear is there if the bloccksize is once increased it can be increased further, so that only few nodes in the end are able to handle all transactions which would lead to centralization and therefore against the purpose of a p2p network.
The plan was that Segwitt would allow an increase from around 1 MB to 1.6 MB which they planned to be enough for the short term, until further scaling techniques are available.
Sadly up to now because of yet lacking use of Segwitt this increase is currently only around to 1.1 MB block size and therefore only 10%.
Currently 1.1 MB is by far not enough to give enough space for the current need of transactions, therefore the transaction fees exploded to 10 even 20 dollar per transaction. The hope is now that segwitt gets adopted and maybe in the next years other scaling techniques like the lightning network or side-chains get adopted. 
There was the try to come to an agreement between a big part of the main bitcoin enterprises and the current bitcoin core developers to first implement segwitt and then make a long term prepared hard fork to increase the blocksize. Sadly this agreement failed.
Therefore  was created.
If you ask me personally what is better? 
Honestly i dont know, both sides have valid arguments. What i know is, that i would have preferred is that the current Bitcoin blocksize is increased step by step to a level where it still could be run on an normal computer. Now with currently 10 dollar transaction fees we risk to loose Bitcoins first mover advantage to other coins.
I think both way centralization is increased, if we increase the block size too much, centralization is increased because you need better nodes, but if we increase the blocksize too less, centralization is increased, because you must pay high transactions fees and therefore only few people could afford to make transactions.
 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:16:07
thats not fully true. Only if a majority of users would open / close them-self payment channels, it would be true. I dont think that in the near future a significant amount of users will open / close channels by them self. Most likely there will be some major wallets and payment providers that handle lightning transactions for their users. So theoretically Bitcoin could work like a settlement layer for big transactions, the average users will most likely use a 3 party service like now banks are used to transfer money. 
If this is good or not that is another question, but yes lightning could work even with 1 MB block size, of course it could work nicer with a higher block-size...
 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:15:03
technically if BCH would have 8 times the use of Bitcoin now fees would most likely behave like Bitcoin now, but with 8 times usage... That is, because the current 1 MB block size is fully artificial without any technical substance it could be 100K, 500K, 1 MB 2 MB 4 MB, all would behave similar (with some small fixes). Only thing which need to be researched is what the limit of Thor network would be...

hmmm good question....
I played as child together with my elder sister (3 years older) and brother (5 years older). At this time I was very young (even before school started) and I could count only up to 9. My sister and brother created their own playmobil town with lots of business in it. And they created their own money in it. They used paper for the money with 1 up to 100.000 written on it. I started to create my own much smaller town in an corner of the room. There I had only money with 1 and 2 and 5 on it.   Then my sister said that if I would write a zero behind the on I can buy ten times of stuff with it. I was so amazed, that I made a 1000.0000.0000 note. That the "mayor" of my city (a playmobil guy) used to travel to mysister and brothers city and exchanged it to their money and then bought a lot of stuff there. Since then I found the concept of money funny and thought that the day will come when it will collapse :)  Since then I had the idea to create an alternative money to bring attention to what all could be possible in this world. Dogecoin and Freicoin sound perfect for that task :)

...the last years I was traveling around with an Indian mystic and stayed in different communities living nearly without money. I quit my job and gave nearly everything* away (some I gave to help to develop Freicoin).
Live became more and more like a dream, sometimes a good dream sometimes a bad dream (because of the misery inside me that is still needed to transform, all what you take in someday have to come out :) ), but the more I manged to stay in the moment the more joyfull and dreamlike it was getting.   
I can only talk from own my experiences and all the different mystics I met the last years. All tell the same ... life is meant to be lived fully. I'm still in the very beginning of this mystical path, I had the luck to get the gift from an great mystic to get a little bit a hint what is possible. Since then all what I have done before was becoming more and more meaningless.    
More and more I became aware that the true richness is inside is not outside!
Now I think about traveling further... lets see what time brings...
All the good!

thx for the clarification, but one more question: Do we really need two different kind of addresses if we use method 2? 
As far as I understand you SegWit dosnt use two different addresses. But how does it otherwise know if the receiver accepts segwit transactions? For the receiver segwit transactions look like spendable for all or?
Here an example without different addresses:
* Old wallet to old wallet:
same as now
* New wallet to new wallet:
A normal transaction with the new transaction version. Output is spendable by all according to the old logic. If the sender wants compatibility, he will publish both a new transaction version and an old transaction version. The new transaction version can be included both in old and new block. The old transaction version must look like outlined in"New wallet to old wallet¨
 
* Old wallet to new wallet:  
Same as New wallet to new wallet.
if New wallet to old wallet should be more simple to implement, then it is good to require the first transaction (that marks coins in the old chain as spendable for all) to be included in the old block. 
* New wallet to old wallet:
you send a special new-style transaction which destroys the BTC on the new side but permits you to spend an appropriate portion of the old-style anyone-can-spend UTXOs created by others. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:32:43
maybe this metric should be changed. Hashrate currently is very centralized in the hand of few and not connected to the economic majority.
More valuable would be to follow up the leading bitcoin service providers and enable bitcoin stakeholders to give some feedback.
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:08:39
the question is what are the alternatives. currently there is a deadlock between the miners and the developers. It doesn't look that one of these parties is ready to move forward. In away it would be very easy, each party should just stay with what they promised. Core should implement an secure way how in the future the blocksize can be increased and the miners should activate segwit.
With each day core doesnt suggest an on chain scaling bejond segwit, they risk a hardfork and on top of that a community split. 
The same is true for the miners that block segwit. 
So what is the solution. Either both party stay with what they promised, or the bitcoin community / users / industry istself must move forward and provide an solution to the deadlock. In this case we have the choice between an nightmare without end or and end with an nightmare that we must go trough. But if you have an idea how to gather the community at this point can come to an solution, im all for it. But first of all we must get rid of certain things that are not true. 
It is not true, that the blocksize cannot be increased beyond segwit with an softfork (see last link)
It is also not true that the miners are in charge. In truth the users are in charge. The miners will in the long run follow the users see ethereum classic.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:30:26
to 1) as luke outlined block size increase beyond segwit does not need necessarily a hard fork and could be done as a soft fork, but would be ethically like a hard fork. Therefore please don't let us mix hardfork yes no arguments with block size increase arguments.
to 2) In away we are trapped between two centralizing effects.
If we don't increase the block size we will have more centralized bitcoin banks like coinbase. If we increase we will have less full nodes except we start to cover their expenses.
Generally I think we should start to reward full node providers like other coins do it with for example 10% of the block reward. This should be far enough at the moment to support thousands of full nodes. In the long run for the miners this would not be a loss, because so or so through competition this coins would be burned for creating heat.
But i guess we will not find a consensus for that...
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:01:24
the price compared to which price?
@_date: 2017-03-08 11:10:49
lol, good argument!
except, that actually my proposal didnt say something about rewarding nodes, just voting :)
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:03:12
fully agree. this has to stop. Here is a very good article how we can upgrade Bitcoin to whatever we need without a hard fork. Its straight forward, lets do that.
To the mining power, this i don't see that much as problem, in the long term they will follow where the money is and the money is in the long term where the users are. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:53:52
why not implement  similar to  masternodes? Require for example 1 bitcoin as security to have a bitcoin masternode. For each block the blockhash is used to choose X masternodes that can make a vote for the protocol. The votes are then counted similar to current softforks in an two week period. A masternode is removed from the voting list if he has not voted for Y blocks. That's it.
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:52:30
who you mean exactly with you the community? 
And how should the community come to an consens?
Currently most of the community is following bitcoin core.
If bitcoin core continues to provide no scaling solution other than seg wit the change of an successful hardfork will increase drastically. So core risks the very same they don't want to risk.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:13:14
we could do it like  and require nodes that want to take part in the protocol voting to deposit lets say one bitcoin. Then it would be even mathematical countable if a majority agrees...
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:56:53
to summarize it, we could increase the block size through using extended block soft forks and would have a similar difficulty to implement and use it as segwit currently has? 
¨This isn't generally possible because new UTXOs will often not be known to old nodes¨
As outlined above: The old transaction version must look like outlined in"New wallet to old wallet¨
As outlined above The old nodes would know the total amount of anyone can spend UTXOs, therefore it is possible to create an old transaction that uses some amount of this anyone can spend UTXOs. Of course this old transaction must then be combined with a new transaction that references which of the new UTXOs are spent, but for the old wallet this part is simply ignored, it is simply happy that it becomes some coins from the anyone can spent UTXOs. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:22:02
great thx!
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:00:01
This is much more clear then saying just the community. 
Just one question how do we measure the consensus of the economic majority?
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:35:00
Isn't it possible to increase the blocksize through a soft fork similar to segwit as outlined by bitpays CEO 
If so why not make your proposal to a full soft fork?
And with failed consensus you mean not 100% consensus? As far as i can remember bitcoin cores roadmap, where most core developers signed, they agreed, that in the future the block size should be increased. Or did they change now their opinion? Even in the side channel presentation it was outlined, that there would be a need to increase the blocksize in the future to allow enough channel openings and closings. And wasn't it even agreed with the chinese miners that core develops a secure path to make a block size increase beyond seg wit? Is this also history now, or is your hard fork this proposal? 
I can only say, if we continue like this, we have not only centralisation with miners, but also with wallet providers. So called blockchain banks like coinbase will get the norm.
Good luck then with decentralisation.
One question, why we don't let the one 1mb block size one mb block size and build a second extended chain on top of it, that is enforced by a soft fork? The third layer can then be payment channels.  
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:59:08
to 1) the point is, the block size can be increased beyond seg wit through using softworks if we want so. Therefore we should not mix the fear / difficulty of hard fork with block size increase. They are independent. 
2) the point is not that bitcoin banks exist and will ever exist, the point is, that they will become the default if the fees are becoming too high, which would also increase centralisation.
yes it makes sense. We don't need all the money currently spent on proof of work. With 90% of the block reward for proof of work bitcoin would still be very very very secure to use.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:20:37
slow adoption more down, than 1 dollar transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:48:38
*¨Full node percentage is at an all-time low, far under a safe percentage of 85%. If you ask people why they don't run a node, the reason is often tied to the block size.¨*
That's only one side of the coin, the other side is, there are no incentives to run a node like other coins have it.
*¨Miners are de facto cheating by skipping the very validation that is a crucial part of their job. This breaks the little security light clients had. The cause for this is the time it takes to verify large blocks.¨*
is it really important that the miners verify the blocks? So or so in the end every full nodes verify the blocks. Therefore miners have an economic incentive to create as few as possible invalid blocks. Therefore the longest chain will be the chain which is accepted by the full nodes. Miners have an big economic incentive to build on valid blocks no matter how big the blocks will be, therefore they will implement techniques how to reduce creating invalid blocks to an absolute minimum. 
*¨Mining requires membership in a centralised backbone (relay networks) in order to not take huge losses due to stale rate as large blocks take time to cross the p2p network. C¨*
Miners do only need the header of the block to start mining, therefore the size does not matter when they can start mining. The size is important when they can verify the block and when they become to know which transactions they can include in their block. To solve this we could also use other techniques like the majority of the miners agreeing on a block candidate. This could be implemented as a soft fork and would also increase the confirmation speed to near instant.
In summary, let's find true solutions to the problems that hinder us to increase the blocksize!
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:17:22
yaa the good old times of nearly zero or even zero transaction fees... the funny thing is, they managed to make the gold price artificially low by removing gold from being used as currency.

@_date: 2017-03-17 10:23:31
and one more thing which is also not true is, that bitcoin is a good store of value even if it is not used much.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:14:44
¨Yes, ~100% (or close enough to practically be it) from the entire &gt; community.¨
 How we measure that?
¨Yes, that was all done, but the community has chosen to reject &gt; such proposals at this time.¨
 Was there another proposal from the core developers to increase the blocksize? For example what happened to 
 the 2/4/8 increase proposal? Can you outline where this proposal was rejected by the ~~community~~ 
 economic majority?
¨It's similar to a softfork in that it doesn't technically require  consensus, but similar to a hardfork in that it ethically does.¨
 In this case shouldn't we free the discussion of all the fear about technical hard forks and concentrate on the real issues? 
¨does the same harm on decentralisation that a hardfork would.¨
Can you outline this further compared to using payment channels? What would be the difference between both out of the perspective from the main 1 MB chain and out of the perspective of the users?
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:19:40
Its good in the long run for Bitcoin to bring the power back to the users. Otherwise the miners lock down Bitcoin forever. Miner will in the long run mine what gives them more money.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:57:39

yes, thx.
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:46:46


 
you forgot to say, that your proposal would have been a defacto decrease of the block size for round about 7 years. I guess it's that what the community rejected drastically. No one wants to go back to 250 KB blocks except maybe you and few others.
There a two ways, either we wake up and make Bitcoin function, or we are soon history. Oh yea once in awhile, do you remember Bitcoin?

Hi all,
here a suggestion for ***reducing the high transaction fee volatility*** and therefore making transaction fees much more stable through introducing a new fee for miners to pay for using space in a given block. In short the more a miner pays the more space he can use in a given block to a max of double the average block size.
**Introducing Miner Fee** := fee that a miner has to pay to use space in a given block. These fees can only be claimed from other miners 42 blocks into the future.
**Average Miner Fee** := average miner fee in the last 14 * 144 (two weeks) blocks.
**The block size one miner is allowed to use would be:
Block-Size = Max-Block-Size * 
MinerFee / (AverageMinerFee + MinerFee)**
- In short, if a miner pays zero miner fee he has zero blockspace to use. 
- If a miner pays the average fee he has half of the max block size to use.
- If a miner pays infinite fee he can use the max block size.
- If a miner pays double the average fee he can use 33% more blockspace than one that pays the average fee
- If a miner pays half the average fee, he can use 33% less space than one that pays the average fee.
With this in place higher fees would allow to use more block space, which increases the supply of block space and therefore reduces the transaction fees during high demand.  The same way it would reduce the available blockspace and therefore supply if there is less demand.
**Why introducing miner fees instead of requiring more work for a miner to create a bigger block?**
Messing around with the block creation rate can have more not well known side effects, so better keep things as good as possible independent from each other. 
**Does this suggestion change the max block size?**
This suggestion is not about suggesting a max block size! In fact if this suggestion should be used, the current max block size should be at least doubled, because in average this suggestion will half the used block space.
**Why not use a dynamic block size according to the golden rule (20 / 80 distribution)?**
yes in fact most likely a suggestion for a dynamic block size according to the golden rule  would be even better to use, because it increases the supply by high demand even stronger and reduced the supply by low demand more drastically. Here how this could look like:
**Block-Size = Max-Block-Size * 
MinerFee / (4 * AverageMinerFee + MinerFee)**
- In short, if a miner pays zero miner fee he has zero blockspace to use. 
- If a miner pays the average fee he has 20% of the max block size to use.
- If a miner pays infinite fee he can use the max block size.
- If a miner pays double the average fee he can use 33% of the max block size, which would be 60% more space than one that pays the average fee
- If a miner pays half the average fee, he can use 11% of the max block size and therefore 45% less space than one that pays the average fee.
**What is the benefit?**
This suggestion will not help to reduce much the average price of a transaction, but will help to make the transaction fees more predictable and stable. Also it provides more space for transactions if there is a great demand and reduces space if there is a low demand and therefore will make transaction confirming much more predictable.
**Can this be implemented as a soft fork?**
Theoretically yes. Why theoretically? Using dynamic block size itself could be implemented as a soft fork. But it will also in average half the used block size. Therefore the block size should be at least doubled if this is introduced. That said, I think it is possible also to increase the current hard limited block size through a soft fork similar to how segwit does it using an extended block, but that's another topic for itself.
As always feel welcome to give feedback!

Hi all,
It looks for me, that there are lots more out there who want to propagate a really free world full of respect for each other and the live itself.
Why not take our efforts together and make this free respectful world step by step real?
I’m ready, and I devote my life to this.
I think we really have now the opportunity to create a fair and free world full of respect for everybody without the need of fighting against something ore somebody.
For me a new society must be based on freedom.
But for me freedom is not only about my individual freedom, real freedom is for me about to take responsibility. Without taking responsibility for me, my actions, the consequences of my actions, the society and the nature I live in, I will end up in slavery.
For me it’s all about to learn how to be responsible and act out of respect.
If I don’t learn how to respect my body, my body will bring suffering to me.
If I don’t learn how to respect the people around me, the people around me will bring suffering to me.
If I don’t learn how to respect society the society will bring suffering to me.
If I don’t learn how to respect the nature I live in, the nature will bring suffering to me.
For my share I am fed up with all this suffering on this planet.
And I’m willing to take my part in ending this suffering.
And I’m willing in joining those who also are willing to take their part in creating a free world full of respect for each other without any ideologies  or dogmas.
See you,
P.s.: For me bitcoin is just one of the first steps to a more free and fair world, and as for throwaway bitcoin is just a tool for me to help to build a free world full to respect. I like the technology behind bitcoin very much, but I think if we really want to help to create a free and fair society we should use the technology of bitcoin and create a a currency that is distributed eaqualiy to the benefit of all humans.
(For example one human one coin per day)
I know that’s not an easy  task to design such an decentralized currency, and I now that we can’t start with 7 Billion humans, but I think that we can find a way if we honestly try and that we can also start with 1000 or 100 people and scale up if time comes.

@_date: 2013-12-13 14:55:00

Hi Mat, Kraken is a new promising Bitcoin exchange. The best thing is, that you can start trading with small amount while waiting for full account verification: 
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:57:17
do you also give then an 3% price reduction like Gyft is doing it?
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:10:27
Yea the goal is to use Freicoin instead of just hording it. At this point Freicoin is an experiment like Bitcoin. For me it all depends how these 5% demurrage is used. If the 5% demurrage for example is used so that you can buy products up to 5% cheaper then in Bitcoin, or you get an 5% on top of an ethical investment, than Freicoin could flourish.
By the way the inflation of Bitcoin at this moment is far higher then 10%

please write this to the bitcoin foundation
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:44:32
up to now the support was good. But better do not put coins for a long time in that your are not ready to loose. But that's  also true for most Bitcoin exchanges out there.
Bitcoin is very new, and the "normal" live span from an exchange at this moment is around one year. 
So lets see. For me personally I give Crpsty a try.

I need a phone provider in germany! Is there one?

First Freicoin is one of the "oldest" coins out there, that started in the end of 2012, yea exactly when the new Mayan calendar started, what a funny coincidence :) The Leading Freicoin Developer Marc is also a known Bitcoin developer.
Second, the Freicoin Foundation should be soon ready in USA that gives out 80% of the generated Freicoins to non profit projects (the other 20% is going to  miners as usual, no pre mine, no extra coins for devs). You can decide with your own coins to which project these Freicoins are going the foundation is just there as long a no fully p2p mechanism, like for example proof of stake,  is in place at protocol level. The giveaway will be fully transparent through the blockchain itself.
More about the foundation you can find here:
Yea Freicoin and Devcoin at this moment are the only coins (at least that I know about)  that want to do something really different than just another Altcoin

You are welcome dude :) 
If you are fast you can take part in the first ever offline Freicoin common good lottery. The lottery begins this Wednesday evening, German time. 5000 Extra Freicoins (Round about one BTC) for common good projects are in the pot donated by the Bitcoin/Freicoin comuntiy Fürth/Nürnberg.
On the same conditions there is also an Bitcoin common good lottery with one extra Bitcoin in it. So if you happen to not have some Freicoins untill Wednesday you are still welcome with Bitcoin :)
As gust we have invited the famous owner of Room77, who was one of the first to accept Bitcoin for his bar/restaurant.  
More Information you can find here:

no, Freicoin is missing :)

I share your passion for financial and social change on a global level.
But I think it's important to realize, that bankers and so on are not our enemies. Most of them just happen to be born in such an crazy world in such crazy circumstances and just happen to follow the craziness around them. Most of them do not want to harm somebody, or even realize that their actions are harming somebody. They just want to live a happy live and don't know how!
If we really want to create a free world full of respect for each other, we should start to respect bankers and all the others.
Only if we do so, we are really free to create a new respectful society.

Freicoin is not the right currency for speculation, because it is designed to be not horded! For that it has an negative interest from about 5% The goal is to establish a p2p mechanism how to use these 5% for the common good. The p2p mechanism can be as distributed as the Bitcoin mining voting is today. For example these 5% could be used to give a bonus to ethical investments or to schools or a basic income, or propagate ecological farming and so on. Everybody is free to take part in making experiments how the Bitcoin technology could be used for the common good. Yea perhaps in the long run really new virtual communities/states could evolve, where everybody is free to take part in the community/state that he wants to take part. Voting could be done perfectly with a kind of liquid democracy system, that is transparently stored in the blockchain.   "It is the time to try big crazy things!"
Quoted from:
[1] 
I promise to use all Freicoins I have or will have for common good! As I already do!
To get rich I don't need Freicoin. Sitting on Bitcoin like a gold bug should be still enough for that. But I'm not interested in hording 
I dont't know if Bitcoin, or Freicoin or Devcoin will be the solution. But what I know is, that we have right now an unbelievable change to do some good for all humanity. Imagine if just some part of the yearly newly created money would be distributed as basic income. Nobody would need to starve anymore because he is short in money! In such a world I want to live! Such a world I want to be part to create!
If someone want to join happy welcome!
All the best,
