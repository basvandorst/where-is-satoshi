It all depends on whether we're going to take BTC seriously as a currency or not. If we're just in it to make money, then (from a currency perspective), we're no different to the existing system.

I agree in principle, but there's still something to be gained by highlighting it and saying thanks to the early adopting retailers for supporting it.
A lot of people still have never even heard of BTC. So it helps build awareness too. It's more about community then it is about technology.

Perhaps in some places. There's still not that density around the world of them, and the retailers I've spoken to aren't getting too much customers to justify having the POS at the moment

awesome - I'd be happy to throw together a site / thread. Any other thoughts about it?

How has this been going? I'm actually just setting up my SMSF at the moment, and was thinking exactly the same thing! How does your SMSF hold the BTC too?

This is awesome

No. This.
Someone's made some commentary. If you hate it so much go hangout at Digg or 4Chan where you can troll all day long.

Sounds like you've got too much time on your hands, considering you have volunteered to monitor all new reddit posts and comment where there has been unusual reply timing

I see. I'm new to BTC and after a quick google didn't come across these sites. So, I can't really answer your question. Thanks for sharing though, I'll look more closely at these sites first!
