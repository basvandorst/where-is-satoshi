What just happened is that evidence has surfaced that a whole truckload of fucking morons didn't shut down their account at the Pokemon exchange after yesterday's fiasco.
It's not like there were no warnings.
And still, in this very thread, there are brainfarts queueing up to bemoan the fact that they can't use the site that has its entire user database posted on rapidshare.
Jesus fucking wept.

I know, but I'm trying to pick a fight here.
I really (and I'm not fucking joking here) want to get to the bottom of the WHY of it. I want to understand the thought process that arrives at "i will continue using mtgox".

I'd like to think they'd have insurance to cover it, but I'm not in the mood for deluding myself.
I have a sneaking feeling that if they were still in the business of trading pokemon cards or whatever the fuck they were, insurers may have taken on that risk. Bitcoins, not so likely.

The reason that you don't find any useful comparisons is that nobody has taken time out from pretending to be Warren Buffet to actually do any.
Here's my quick comparo-review...
MtGOX: Hasn't been split wide open in the past 24 hours (that we know of) but that's mainly because it's been shut down. I expect it to disappear in a puff of larceny sometime within the next week.
TradeHill: Probably has been breached already but unclear whether they know or not. If it hasn't, it will be - most likely within the next week. Slightly suspicious suggestions of an under-the-counter link with MtGOX.
BritCoin: Alpha quality, use at own risk, mistakes can happen. At least they're honest. Doesn't inspire confidence.
Bitcoin7: The less said the better. The only thing this one has going for it is that it's not as big a target as the others. Will explode in a cloud of pastebinned personal data at some point in the not too distant future.

That's a 50% answer at best.
A 100% answer would involve a detailed explanation of why the fucking site was still online when the owner knew it was not fit for purpose.

It's probably not immediately obvious to the untrained eye, but any lolbertarian economist will see from the graph that my theory is based on the correlation (6-sigma confidence) between the USD price of bitcoins and the longitude of the centre of mass of the six largest (by mass) living Humbolt Penguins.

We'll probably never know since from day-0 (see what I did there?) they have been systematically enagaged in willful destruction of evidence.

Can't believe I'm so stupid. When i was trying to put together BitcoinChumpWrangler.org a while back I had to abandon it when I found that I could only fit around 1000 bitcoins on the server. The answer was staring me in the face the whole time - Pooled Holding Servers.
I think I'll get back on the project - I guess a 1:1 server to bitcoin ratio would provide optimal security but I'll probably have to play with that number a bit since I need to have something to show for it all when I cut and run.

Just so it's clear, since my original post was made in haste, I was objecting primarily to your terrible punctuation and not the content of your post.

That thread (and the wider episode in general) is a veritable treasure trove of grade-A moonbats.
It's apparently fixed.
On the fucking sly.
No disclosure.
No apology.
No statement on liability.
And you get this:


No, you're a fucking moron.
and this...


Yup, an estimated 113% safer than completely untrustworthy. It's now the safest pokemon card trading site in the whole of the internet since no vulnerabilities have been discovered in the past 24hrs.
and this (from this very same Reddit thread)


FFS, blaming MtGox completely is not too much.
I get the feeling that these people are going to continue using that site after it and the operator have been demonstrated to be (at best) utterly out of their depth.
I mean, who could have guessed?  
I did. A lot of others did too. As I said the other day: It's best to get this shit out in the open now, but I don't really think that the lessons are penetrating very deeply with some people.
@_date: 2011-08-05 10:49:31
New site concept:
1. Subscription service (buttcoins obviously)
2. Automatically generate semi-plausible (to the average goof) messages that can buy you some time to get the tickets to a country with no extradition treaties.
3. Subscriber chooses vertical market segment and buzz-word density
4. PGP signature option (extra cost)
5. Easy to imbed javascript in server maintenance page
6. Email/SMS alerts possible too
Anyone in?
@_date: 2011-06-21 14:41:35
You couldn't make it up, could you?
Actually, you could and they are. Seemingly as they go along.
I can't wait for the next MtGOX Choose Your Own Adventure Mission Pack.
Wait; am I getting this right? Say I had 50 pokemon cards that I withdrew from MtPOX and, for some unknown reason, they were a bit miffed about it. They just set my account to -50 thus creating 50 magical virtual anti-pokemon cards to make things right?
50 - 50 = 0  even if you're using IEEE-754 floats.
Sounds like they're trying to balance the books by disappearing 
fictional Bitcoins that were created entirely in their system.
If nobody plays ball, they're fucked.

It means that if you read the article, it consists mostly of quotes. There is very little content. It's a writing style that is often symptomatic of a confused mind.

If I was handing out advice (which I'm not) I would say don't touch any of them right now. There's a live threat of another 'Black Friday' which I personally rate as being at least as credible as the claims that everything is all fixed now.
That said, quite how any of these exchanges establish credibility or trust remains to be seen. The current 'hapless guinea-pigs' methodology doesn't quite do it for me.
Please inform yourself of the state of play around these 'exchanges' and make a choice based on what you think, not what anyone else says.
@_date: 2011-06-21 11:35:39
Get everything back up and running quick as possible guys!
Here's a clue for the clueless: What's happening right now is destruction of evidence. 
The MtGox system should be in a state of forensic lockdown and not being scrubbed and patched ready for the next round of pass-the-parcel.
Sorry, I forgot; they looked through the logs and everything is ok. 
Carry on.
@_date: 2011-06-18 11:49:05
All that you say is ostensibly correct.
The huge fly in the spanner is that none of it makes any difference whatsoever absent the willingness to question the quality of ones work.
"No" is almost never the correct answer to "Have I fucked up somewhere?"

A very very long time if everyone has the sense to not use the fucking site when it opens up again.

That's how I feel when I see someone suggesting that a sensible response to lots of people being burned by sticking lots of bitcoins in one place is for lots of people to stick bitcoins in one place.

@_date: 2011-06-16 14:55:57
It's obvious that the problem is entirely your end, since MtGox is still up and running accepting new registrations.
Thankfully, it's utterly impossible that there's an undisclosed exploit being run against MtGox. Even if it were possible, no serious criminals would bother hunting for a way in with such little incentive - hundreds of thousands of dollars of untraceable cash.
Well, it's good that we get this kind of shit out in the open sooner rather than later.
I predict that you won't feel any better soon, but you won't feel lonely for long.

Not really. 
Now; if MyGoddamnSandwich (online fridge) went down just before lunch I'd be pissed off.
Why the fuck do people constantly use things they don't need just because it has 'My' in the fucking domain name?
Here's a clue: Do a lookup on the domain name. If your name does not appear anywhere in the registration then you can assume that the 'My' refers to someone other than you.
Is this behaviour some kind of maladaptive mutation or just a mental illness?

And that's exactly why:
1) You don't do it.
2) If you see someone else do it, don't be tempted to assume that they have a clue.
Clues aren't always additive, sometimes they are multiplicative, thus:
Say I have half a clue how to make a web site and I do it myself. The resulting website will be twice as good as one created by Me and someone else who also only has half a clue.

I think that they piss people of at their own risk.
I think that it only takes one person to be pissed off enough to go to the Japanese authorities.
I think that the Japanese equivalent of conspiracy to destroy evidence relevant to the investigation of a criminal offence should be enough to sort the problem out once and for all.
