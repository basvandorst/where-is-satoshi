- Having it audited by the IRS 
- Having it frozen
- Having trading frozen
- Having it accidentally disappearing

How to cash in on the BTC hype:
Step 1: Buy pink-sheet OTC listed shit company
Step 2: Apply for a change of ownership
Step 3: Change company name to something related to Blockchain
Step 4: Spread the news (i.e. ihub, ST PnD)
Step 5: Profit? $$$$$$$$$$

Every time someone brings up the LN on they get this exact same reply in different variations from various users. So where is the LN?

Hahahahah, I love greed. You exhibit all aspects of it. You have zero idea about the cryptocurrency and zero idea about the economic situation in Venezuela that is causing the huge differentiation in pricing.
Yeah, go to Venezuela and sell it. And then probably get beheaded after for your USD.

I remember the last rally. The media was talking about Bitcoin in a very positive way and the possibility of the Winklevoss ETF. 
The minute BTC started having -10% days, they started reversing their position. People started dumping.
You are naive if you believe this is short term volatility.

How do you feel about your comment today?
This is how unregulated markets act. Cue the HODL spam
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:07
I believe in the technology, but I do not believe in using Bitcoin as a speculative instrument for greedy individuals. It is the opposite of everything Bitcoin was supposed to be.
That being said, buy back at the bottom :)

As always, there is a lot of cognitive dissonance in this subreddit. Many people always repeat the same joke posts as a way to cope with the tiny belief in their mind that Bitcoin can enter a bear phase very quickly.

Yes, I see the ETF plans being denied again...unfortunately thanks to the actions of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency exchange this time.

Yep, when the media reverses their position, be prepared to run. A host of other problems that have yet to appear (ie. Tether/Bitfinex-ominous removal of warrant canary, Coinbase's reputability) will exacerbate the decline. I told all of my friends to exit yesterday after seeing the BCH fiasco and media attack.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:34
No, it's the media switching positions on Bitcoin along with the coordinated attack on Bitcoin by Bitcoin Judas supported by the most popular crypto exchange Coinbase which has just lost its reputation as a reputable exchange..

The bull trap that we just had from the bounce at 13k for the last hour confirms my beliefs. 
Good luck tomorrow morning when the media starts reporting on this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:57
I was analyzing the price movement for the last two days and also came to this conclusion. The media is also shifting opinion on Bitcoin right at this moment, thanks to Conbase, an SEC penny stock shutdown and a coordinated effort by Bitcoin Judas to destroy BTC.
Edit: Movement seems to be confirming our prediction
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:25:37
Good on you for being an optimist, but can you at least spell that correctly before pulling numbers out?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:12:04
Every time Bitcoin goes up in a frenzy, the media starts to report on it and gets a mass of buyers to join in on the bonanza. The past week, the media has switched its position and thus (to me) has signaled the beginning of the Bitcoin bear market, along with the beginning of a host of problems that will lead to a prolonged bear market. Don't take it from me though. I'll just get downvoted.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:19:14
Alright, no FUD intended from someone who played the game back before 2013.
First of all, the media in 2013 did the same thing. They advocated the adoption of Bitcoin throughout the end of fall and then all of a sudden switched sides (China started regulating crypto and some other crap) and Bitcoin faltered and started having -10% days. This is not the main problem.
Another problem was that having -10% days made people unwilling to hold on to BTC and thus started the fire selling. The fire selling was not the only problem though. Shortly after, Mt. Gox suffered a catastrophic attack which caused people to lose faith in the cryptocurrency. People allegedly killed themselves.
As of right now, we have three things that can prolong an inevitable bear market.
We know that Bitfinex's Chris Ellis removed his warrant canary. What for? Tether? Let's not pretend for a second that this is not an issue.
Roger Ver (aka Bitcoin Judas) seeks to bring down BTC for personal gain. He colludes with media (see CNBC) to do so. He is a general asshole that would take down all of cryptocurrency if he had to.
We also know that Coinbase is not a reputable exchange anymore. Coinbase has its own motives.
Also, one other big thing is that we are seeing the limits of Bitcoin at its current stage.
Underlying assets wise, I moved out of BTC yesterday after seeing the red flags. I would suggest doing so before the media starts reporting that *Bitcoin drops 30% overnight*.

Guess what's going to be all over the media tomorrow?
**Bitcoin drops 30%** or 40% at this rate, **Bubble popping?**
More retail will panic sell.
You were smart to sell. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, you have your own beliefs.

A week ago: Bitcoin will be listed on the CME - bull for the general population
Now: Bitcoin down 10% due to Bitcoin Cash being listed, Coinbase accused of insider trading, Charlie Lee sells all of his LTC, transaction fees and times at an all time high - bear for the general population
You must be blind if you can't see what is really happening right now
