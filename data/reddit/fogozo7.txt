The problem is the bitcoin chart isn't rational for true technical analysis.  There is extreme fear and greed.  The faster a chart moves, the faster it is likely to reverse.  Jumping up 20% in a short time isn't a healthy sign.  Gradually increasing with small retracements would be much more positive.  Question: is anyone still using bitcoin for purchases of just holding it in hopes of goes through the roof?

Fair enough, thank you.  Do you think it would have been more appropriate to use the logarithmic chart to just show, say the last two years and not begin at zero?

If the majority are buy and hodl, bitcoin isn't serving its intended purpose which is to replace  fiat currency.  When the time comes that people see more value in spending bitcoin instead of dollars to make purchases then it is working.  Until that happens it looks unsustainable to me.

Sad to say, from a technical analysis limited movement like this at support indicates it has run out of buyers willing to push the price up.  Likely the next movement will see it plummet.  When big players are trying to enter you will see a consolidation area.  That green candle with huge wick from a week ago or so is a bad sign for bulls.  If there was consolidation going on preceding a bullish move prices would rotate the range of that green candle with wick.

That's what I always question.  These people who love bitcoin so much aren't out there spending all their coins to purchase things, they actually prefer the USD.  That, and I wouldn't want to go to war with the almighty Dollar.  If/when bitcoin becomes a threat how hard would it be for the U.S. government to do one hack and send bitcoin down to oblivion.

What consolidation?  Consolidation needs a range and it has flatlined.  If anything you could call Sept - mid Oct a bearish distribution period since red candles are larger than green.

It's not an investment, it isn't a business with P&amp;L, it isn't a physical asset like gold.  The fact that you people hodl bitcoin but PREFER U.S. dollars to make all your purchases proves it fails as substitute for fiat currency.
