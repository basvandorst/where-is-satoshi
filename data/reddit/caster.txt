There really is a subreddit for *everything*.
Subbed. :D

Yes, but I fail to see the problem.

You can use gold as a conductor or as a ductile material, highly reflective surface, or as a highly bio-compatible implant substance.

There are a hundred people who all own $10. There's a bank which stores their money and lends it out.
If the bank kept all the money in a box, it would have $1,000. But because it lends money out, it doesn't actually have $1,000 at any given time.
Suppose it lends $900 out, leaving it with $100 in its box. Now, there isn't enough money in the bank for all 100 people to all take out their $10.
Which means that, if everyone wanted to get their money, only the first 10 people would get $10, and the rest would get nothing.
So capital controls are essentially saying, "OK people, we are going to let each of you withdraw $1 so everyone can have $1."

I don't think it's that far-fetched to think someone is going to invent a better Bitcoin in the future.
Bitcoin does have a few potential issues. Like how the computations people perform in order to mine are fundamentally useless, where that processor power might be a proof of work in some productive endeavor. Or the inevitable existence of "zombie" coins that have been lost forever because some idiot lost his key.

No, that is irreconciliably ambiguous.
Imagine a contract: "I agree to pay you $1,000,000."
Here's a million Satoshis. *Technically* that is what I promised. See addendum in appendix 534(b), which says the $ symbol is used for Satoshis.
@_date: 2015-07-24 23:24:24
No, because the actual symbol used in those contexts is USD $1,000,000.
If you wanted to carry the analogy forward, we would be talking about BTC $1,000,000. Which is both not an improvement over using a different symbol to refer to Satoshis, and also ambiguous.
Satoshi could be as simple as an 'S' instead of a $ symbol.
S1,000,000 looks weird but it isn't used anywhere else. The closest would be S/ for Peru's currency.

Must have been an interesting meeting at MPAA's secret headquarters.
"What are we doing today, guys?"
"The same thing we always do, sir."
-- new guy chimes in --
"Actually, I was thinking of doing something different."
"Let's hear it."
"How about we give the pirates free bitcoins?"
"Uh... You must be new here..."

That seems like an odd criticism of the money itself. It isn't the $20 bill's fault that some people are in possession of so many of them. Ability to possess it is intrinsic to the function of money. It is monetary policy, laws, and actions by governments, banks, and corporations that causes the state of affairs where the rich get richer. I don't expect a mechanical or structural feature of the money entity itself to have such an effect at discouraging certain people from possessing it, or possessing too much of it.

Well, no, not exactly. You don't control the Bitcoin network because you own Bitcoins. Nodes control the Bitcoin network. So, theoretically, you could buy so many computers that you control 51% of the network's hash power, and gain control that way (51% attack). Still, buying 51% of all the hash power is potentially a legitimate concern if you can show that it would actually be feasible to do.

Indeed. If you take that reading, the street value of the total amount of illegal drugs the US government has destroyed is hardly "one of the worst financial mistakes in its history."

I guess it's analogous to communicating over the radio. While everyone can hear everything that is transmitted over the air, nevertheless you can send a message securely using encryption.
If you only ever use a particular wallet once, there is just not enough information to tie it to a particular person. If you use unique wallets in every transaction, and use each wallet only once, then there is no way to tell which wallets belong to any particular person.
@_date: 2015-11-07 20:46:23


But that's the whole point. You only use each key once. If someone were to somehow figure out a key they would only get one transaction. One use would be both a deposit and a withdrawal to a different wallet, not just a deposit. But that's not enough information to do, well, anything. You can't associate it with other wallets out in the wild, and you can't associate it with a person who controls it.
If you're really paranoid you might even engage in some additional transactions just to make tracking your money virtually impossible, like mixing funds in a larger pool with others, and withdrawing to a completely different wallet.
@_date: 2015-11-07 17:03:04
I mean, you have a point. But it is incredibly trivial to create wallets, and it does not matter at all if an empty wallet is destroyed/lost/neglected.
If Bitcoin were to achieve incredibly widespread usage, large suites of software and perhaps even professional finance managers might handle thousands of wallets for each individual, possibly several for each individual transaction, some or all of which might never be used again.
Basically, if you're worried about people figuring out ownership of wallets and tracking, then all you've got to do is get a bit more inventive with your wallets.

The weirdest thing about the Nigerian prince scam, is that for some reason people actually **believe** the part about them being from Nigeria, as if the Nigerian prince scammers are actually in Nigeria. 
The odds that they are actually in Nigeria, I would say, are about zero. In fact, it's far more likely the Nigerian prince scammers, as well as ransomware dealers and most other cyber criminal enterprises, are all in eastern Europe or Russia, areas with both high computer literacy and poor criminal enforcement / prevalence of organized crime.
