This is important:  @_date: 2014-11-01 21:53:06
I think one of the reasons for this is due to the increasing merchant adoption. Right now most merchants do not keep any bitcoin payments they receive - they convert them into fiat, which means somewhere in the process, the bitcoins are sold on an exchange. More and more people spending coins (bc now there are a lot more placed accepting bitcoin payments) causes more and more to be sold on the open market, which leads to the downward pressure in the price. I think we're in a phase where more coins are being spent then there is in new money coming into the bitcoin economy (at this moment at least.)

The problem for you is that the specialized ASIC miners are so much faster than your computer's CPU or your video card (for mining bitcoin at least). To make your electricity costs back or make any significant amount of coin, you would have to buy an ASIC miner. Mining is not easy to profit from anymore - if it was everyone would be doing it. My opinion is that if you think bitcoins have a good future, then just take the jump and buy some.  No risk, no reward. Thats one of the most important lessons in life. The fact that they seem "expensive" (relative to the price 1yr ago) shouldn't mean much if you indeed think that bitcoins will be important in the near future. That's my 2 satoshis.

No oceanspray100 is correct. I have never seen an exchange charge fees for a cancelled limit order as long as the order has not been filled yet. Market orders is another thing, as they are executed immediately and can't be cancelled. You are right in that this is a tool most certainly used to manipulate the order book. Happens all day every day. Just watch the market depth charts (bitcoinity.org has a good one) and you will see how the order book is distributed and changing over time, from limit orders being initialized and/or cancelled.

Yeah, the USB miners are not cost efficient at all. They are more of a novelty product than a real investment.  They're still a cool way to learn about the inner workings of the bitcoin protocol, and they strengthen the bitcoin network - but with the current exchange rate there's essentially no profit to be had. In my opinion, the most cost efficient method to join the game now would be to just buy some coin yourself. Best of luck!

I don't think that would ever happen.  You are not going to get a full consensus among the network, and the blockchain would fork.  also, consider what would happen if some of the stolen coins (via transaction malleability) were used to pay some russian crime boss, who used them for an order via bitpay, which was then sold on bitstamp, and then purchased by the little 6 year old down the street that has a smart phone and a coinbase acct.  Would you want to steal this child's coins, as well as roll back all those transactions that the businesses have already processed and would lose money if reversed?! If so, you must hate children... err.. no... I mean....  Yeah, you get it I guess.  In all seriousness, I don't believe this would ever happen, and it would shake up the trust in bitcoin for much of us (me included).

I very much believe this too. I do not believe the average Joe will actually use bitcoins.  Rather, they will use services and platforms that are built to utilize the bitcoin protocol as the engine to perform behind the scenes value transfer. The average Joe won't need to know anything about how the bitcoin protocol operates, and they won't need to directly transact in bitcoin - just like I don't need to understand programming or TCP/IP or networking or whatever to be able to send an email or to update my facebook status.

He gives PayPal that permission by using the service, which likely contains a terms of service clause relating to paypals rights to collect on disputes they receive.  It may not be a true "chargeback", but PayPal isn't a true merchant account either.

This is the true power of bitcoin - to be able to transfer buying power between any 2 points in the world (almost) instantly. I expect these types of services will certainly develop in the coming years as the BTC economy evolves and matures; but they will obviously be highly regulated. The users need not know of bitcoin at all - thats beautiful! Because let's face it, the relative technical complexity of btc is a big barrier for entry for much of the general public.  I also believe it is likely services will form that will allow international corporations to use a similar technique to move buying power around the world with agility.  I think the future of bitcoin is that it will be integrated and mixed up with our current legacy fiat banking system.... I can't imagine a BTC only economy.

i seriously would not use coinbase as a savings acc.  Look at all the problems they are having! You dont even get a wallet w private keys that you can completely control.  They are having all sorts of problems because of this, such as their customers having to wait days to transfer coins out.  Just set up a brain wallet, write down your pass phrase and get a hard copy of your private key. then send your coins there, and rest easy that they will be safe.  Then you can setup a blockchain wallet to watch your  balance. MUCH safer!

This would introduce bitcoin to a whole new group of speculators, which might bring volatility to the price moves.  However speculation usually causes the price to over-inflate, so this might not be the worst thing in the world and might be good for those of us already holding BTC.  Honestly, IMO, anything that makes bitcoin more accessible is good for the BTC economy - It's just too hard for a common consumer or investor to acquire BTC at the moment.  And we can't stay "grassroots" forever...
@_date: 2013-07-20 20:22:40
The point is that you haven't even given them a chance to correct it.  If you research others with the same problem, you would see that coinbase almost always ruled in their favor and promptly gave them the coins at the price they purchased (even if BTC went up in price), and white-listed them for future transactions.  If you ask them to fix it and they say no, then you are right to call them assholes.  But at least give them a chance before throwing out insults. That's all I'm saying.

If we are talking about what gives off more CO2, then it is possible a horse beats a car.  But regarding which pollutes more should be defined by the source of the CO2.  If a horse feeds from completely natural food source (plants) that is converting CO2 in the atmosphere into digestible hydrocarbons by utilizing the sun's energy, then yes, I am sure.  the horse isn't adding any extra CO2 into the carbon cycle than existed before; he is merely paying the role of converting plant matter into CO2, which is then converted back into plant matter again.  But if we extract hydrocarbons from miles underground, and then burn them, we are adding extra carbon (ie CO2) into the carbon cycle than existed before.  The earth was in a fine equilibrium before we started burning fossil fuels.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:25:06
But a horse derives it's carbon and energy source from the natural carbon cycle not from hydrocarbons buried miles underground that would never have seen the light of day if it weren't for humans.  So a horse technically isn't polluting because it's not adding any extra co2 into the atmosphere that wasn't already part of the carbon cycle.  A car is.

Fees will probably be considerable. I believe the Vancouver ATM is 3%/5% sell/buy fee. I would imagine this would be at least the same, and probably closer to 10%. Yeah it kinda defeats the purpose of low transaction costs for BTC.  But the more avenues people have to buy and sell BTC, the better - even if they get charged significant fees.

That is a good idea. They might just send you an empty package, and you will have no idea until you sign for it. If they get your signature, they can turn around and say your product was delivered and use your signature as proof.  when a merchant has the customers signature, the merchant will win the dispute a majority of the time.

That, or rather BFL has been appeasing large buyers all along, and has purposely hung the small fish that funded them out to dry. No one would spend 1million without having close and intimate conversations with the BFL management - the buyer must know they will be receiving something in a timely manner. If someone can spend 1million in btc mining hardware, they can also pay for a lawyer.  I think this shows clearly why everyone has been experiencing delays from  bfl.

If bitcoins continue to thrive and become more mainstream, I bet that by the time it is ready to "auction" the bitcoins they will just transfer (or rather, trade for fiat) the bitcoins to the federal reserve or some other govt financial authority.  I seriously do not believe the government will actually auction off these bitcoins at a public auction, especially if they think there is even a shred of a chance of bitcoins becoming a real part of our future.  They would keep them under their control so that they can have another tool to control our financial futures.
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:52:40
PayPal can still refund it. They can refund it up to 180 days past the purchase date.  The 45 day limit is just a charade to limit the number of reversals they get.  You just need to raise hell with the PayPal staff, perhaps ask for a supervisor and explain the situation, and they will excalate your dispute to the next level. which means refund even if after 45 days.  If they refuse, threaten a chargeback. If that still does nothing, contact your bank or credit card company and they will take care of it.  Visa and mc are a little more strict on their chargebacks, where as discover and Amex almost always side with the customer.   BFL has no say regarding if PayPal reverses a payment or not, and I certainly think you are entitled to one if BFL misled you. Best of luck.
@_date: 2013-10-31 09:08:45
they can't hold your money indefinitely. it should be sorted out soon. My guess is that the random deposits in your account has flagged you for money laundering. I dont think this is specifically caused by bitcoins, but certainly is related. Also im not saying you are laundering, but banks regularly check for accounts that follow this pattern as they deem this to be uncharacteristic and risky behavior (especially for a personal checking acct).  You didn't do anything wrong - they are just the govt's puppet. They are probably in the process of contacting the other banks involved to get more details, and when they learn enough they should release your funds. It's absurd that they can control how you handle YOUR money, but that's the fucked up world we live in.  Many years ago I had a bank (Ally Bank - i do not recommend!) freeze an account of mine, and after calling and calling, they closed my account and cut me a check within 10 business days. Go to a BofA branch and demand your money and to close your account - and go in person.  Sorry to hear of your troubles, but as hard as it is, try to stay calm and collected, and take your business elsewhere the first chance you get access to your money.  BofA has ridiculous fees anyway and the worst customer service. You're better off without them.

I've have yet to have an unresolved problem with coinbase, and I've purchased nearly 4k from them in the last month alone. A few weeks ago I had to wait a few extra days to have my coins credited with the 'pending transaction' issues, but everything still worked out in the end.  I will say, as an ecommerce business owner myself, that they are fairly slow at responding and resolving problems, but they do seem to pull through in the end.  
The last purchase I made was credited to my acct on Thursday, and I transferred them out of my wallet on Friday (yesterday). So the system is working.  Just give them some time to respond to you ( I agree that they are fairy slow at resolving problems).  I hope it all works out! Best of luck.
