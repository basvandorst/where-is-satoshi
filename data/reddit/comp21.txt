Yes but you only get the segwit fee if you send from a segwit address, not to

Keep in mind, there's strong evidence to suggest that coinbase is screwing the mempool by not batching transactions... Like 40-60% of the mempool is coinbase... So it doesn't mean no one is using it, it could mean coinbase finally got off their ass and implemented the correct code.

See... My accountant says the trade us taxable but that second form you linked suggests it's not...
Luckily, after all deductions I'm under the $37,000 threshold so I may just go ahead and refile but damn man, that's a lot of transactions to go through :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:20:24
My argument that two cryptos are alike in so far that two businesses are alike... That move of capital isn't taxed so yeah, I didn't think this would be either.
However, I'm going to refile the last three years. Luckily, going through, my transactions aren't as numerous as I thought... However, my aunt is going to have a nightmare.

See, I've been reading where bandwidth wasn't the concern, storage was... If we moved to a larger block size, there was concern over whether small time "full nodes" would be able to store it all in a few months... 
But china was primarily concerned with bandwidth and not storage.
I keep wondering whether they're going to make their own alt coin...

I looked at your site... give me a quick TLDR please :) Are you basically localbitcoin.com?
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:28:03
Then I'm going to guess it's in your router/modem... Do you have your old moderm? Try it...
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:55:51
Oh! Shit man... Use localbitcoins.com... They have an escrow service. Not the best solution and I realize it's hind sight but maybe it'll help down the road...
Otherwise, you could protest with PayPal but as pointed out earlier, if you circumvented paying a fee, you're probably screwed.
@_date: 2015-06-13 05:27:32
Customer got the virus at around 630am... It chews through the files it wants and encrypts them... While it's finishing that another machine gets infected with a different variant... It goes behind the first one and starts encrypting the files that are already encrypted... Double encrypted.
The misunderstanding probably comes in the fact that encryption takes time... It's not instant.  If you catch it in time you can stop the rest of the files from being encrypted.
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:13:20
So am I reading all the comments correctly that this could not be done with bitcoin? Seems like I'm getting that there's a technical reason this couldn't occur since the chain doesn't store accounts, just transactions?
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:19:49
As far as I understand it "random blocks" wouldn't work because each block is cryptographically linked to the ones before and after.
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:38:40
Ah... K.. So based on this I could just throw my wallet.dat file in to my 1password encrypted database, let my wallet create a new dat file with no coins in it, run that as a full node and I'm covered? I dont spend my coins right now... I mine around $18 a day but I'm saving them all up for a trip to Europe in august.
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:44:10
I was about to say the same... I just started selling on localbitcoins.com and it's great to work with. Added benefit: you get to meet other enthusiasts so, since you're new to bitcoin, it might be good to have someone face to face that's willing to answer a few questions.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:07:31
ah... well so far I've done the following:
* confirmed that my wallet.dat file I keep in my encrypted database will work by swapping it with the one I was ~~working~~ using, my coins are there so I deleted the wallet.dat file off my C, restarted bitcoin and it made a new one with nothing in it
* searched across all my hard drives, my NAS and my google drive to make sure no wallet.dat files exist there
* went ahead and did these both on my LTX and XDG wallets as well, not like there's much there but $250 is $250 :)
Once I get back home (I'm in central Florida now taking care of my grandmother... grandfather passed last week), I'll sit down and figure out a better wallet to use.
Again, this is all great info... I'm trying to teach my cousin some of this as well and I get the blockchain, mining, etc, but security was something I hadn't wrapped my head around yet. I could ask a million more questions but I don't want to be a pest so I'll leave it here for now :)
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:19:45
That was my thought... I mean eventually it's going to be unmanageable right? If we were doing the same number of transactions MasterCard is now, how big would the chain be in just a day?
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:54:25
Well, I can't comment if it happened or not... That actually never crossed my mind. Maybe I'm too trusting...
Anyway, i would say that if I was doing business in Greece, I might ask something similar. Can't really trust the Greek euro (I've read a couple reports where their euro denomination may be cut from the rest? Like a hard fork so to speak and they'll become a euro alt coin?)...
You're right, moving to btc is a risk outside of the traditional system but is it any riskier than doing business in Greece right now?
@_date: 2015-06-17 03:21:38

I wonder how they would? Is there a way to track someone through bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:07:49
five months... Feb to end of June... And my "return" was calculated a couple weeks ago so I should be around $2k now... So, a month sooner and closer to 70% return... 
Now, about difficulty... You're right, it should go up but right now and for the past few months it's basically flat lined (at last when compared to the previous year) and I believe it will continue to flat line as long as the price of btc hovers around the break even point for people to mine it... (The difficulty only goes up as more people get in which is not cost effective right now)
Now, my business decisions are based (like most people's) on an 18 month return. That's why if I had to pay for electric, I would not have done this but so far I've been lucky... And these numbers don't even take in to account the 12.5% margin I charge on localbitcoins.com and the 28% I wrote off on my taxes to "invest" in this equipment... I'm basically break even right now when you factor taxes (I own a computer related business so it's easy to justify this) and I still have all the assets I could sell if needed so there's a lot on the balance sheet right now. I'm solid in the black.
Now, for electric... I may have some friends in dorms who enjoy my buying them an occasional beer in exchange for hosting the devices... May have... May not have... I'm not saying :)
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:10:58
Do you really think there's enough people in sf willing to pay for all this or is this something you want to do because you like it?
That's a serious question... So many in business fall in love with their ideas because _they_ love the product.. Never asking or finding out what their customers want.
Ex: I was consulting for a high end children's loft... One of my companies is marketing consulting... Now, in this case we were critiquing the website (which was terrible)... In order to press the point home to the owner (she wanted all that crap on there) I brought in one of her customers to tell her why she couldn't use the website... Customer got defensive, said "this is here because... This is fine here..." Iv finally told her "I don't give two shits what you want, your customer is 35-45 years older than you... Either pay attention or go out of business".
Don't get caught up in your own ideas so much that you lose market focus.

@_date: 2015-06-23 12:22:01
What you guys are not understanding is that this company he deals with is not fraudulent by nature. He is not having them prove assets because he has had issues with them... He's having them prove assets because they're in Greece and the region is unstable. Yes, there's a millions things that could go wrong but that can happen any time you do literally _anything_. At least with this he did prove (or hopefully will prove) that the company is solvent and he possibly moved a somewhat large company in Greece over to thinking about conducting their business in btc... Which is something that was just ALL OVER THE SUBREDDIT YESTERDAY.
Ffs... You guys can't have it both ways... Either you want btc to take off in Greece as a way to prove it's viable and to give it exposure or you don't... Wtf.

There is no "opening a port"... What you're doing is " forwarding a port "... On the inbound firewall rule you forward port 8333 to the internal static up of the machine you're hosting your wallet on... Of course, this assumes you have port 8333 allowed through your firewall (which, OK, I guess on your PC is " opening a port ")
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:40:22
Now this makes sense... So we are really just worried about a vulnerability in the client and/or someone finding my wallet.dat file correct?

Yeah... Unmanageable in less than a month... We can claim that "technology will keep up" but recalculation of the entire chain has got to get problematic if we did those transactions for just a year...
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:02:08
I get what you're saying on the bandwidth vs storage and I agree... as far as china, my thought is they control 60% of the hashing... they don't want to change the block size limit... they're a big enough economy to have their own successful coin... what's stopping them from having a chinese-backed crypto currency?
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:35:03

That's basically what happened to this guys business... One sales guy got infected at 630am, the virus begins chewing through the files encrypting them... Around 2-3 hours later another guy gets infected which goes right behind the first one to encrypt them again. Luckily he didn't waste time with coinbase... He went to localbitcoins.com and found me. His first purchase was around $600 and then he had to buy $800 from me
What happened to that church is terrible though... That's why I sat with this guy and went over everything I knew about not getting infected again and how to change around his backups.
@_date: 2015-06-15 04:22:39
How does one push transactions through a particular node? I run a node just by forwarding port 8333 to an empty wallet but I don't know how to "use" it outside of that.
Is there a website I could learn about this at?

Just to explain this a little better to all the people who apparently read way too much in to things (read: anything past the actual words I posted):
nowhere in there did I advocate for them to adopt BTC... I could give two flying shits if they use BTC or piles of goat crap for their economy, I'm just curious if it's happening.
I'm trying to find _facts_. Partly to see if they are actually doing anything with BTC and partly to learn if there's a way to track these kinds of trends in BTC.
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:08:12
Damnit... I say "now" too much when I start a new paragraph.
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:37:30
When I tell new people about btc I start with "it's digital cash"... Relate it to something they already understand but relate it directly and completely... Meaning:
* yes, you can use it to do illegal things... Because it's cash, but that also means you can do regular things... Because it's cash
* yes, it's anonymous if you do it correctly, just like cash... Because it's cash
* yes, it can be stolen from you... Because it's cash
There's good and bad in every tool... People have to understand that yes, btc has somewhat of a bad name to the unwashed masses because of media hype but I promise you, American currency has been used at least 100,000x more for illegal actions than btc has been and we use that every day.
Then I would send them all a couple bucks so they can see how fast it comes in... Then ask them how many travel to Europe... "Ever get stuck somewhere without cash? It'd be great if there was some way to get you emergency money immediately all the way across the ocean..." HINT HINT WINK WINK :)
@_date: 2015-06-23 11:53:00
Everyone here is so negative as is typical when one thinks outside the box.
While I agree that btc is to volatile right now and that you should get a signed message from them at that address, I still think this is a great idea for down the road (after volatility lessens). Great creative thinking.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:15:34
well, the way it works is you pay them and they send you a key to type in... they don't unlock it remotely. So, you have two keys... try one, if it decrypts, yay! if it doesn't... try the other :)

No sir. He was just the "bitcoin mule" as he put it. I'm trying to establish a business relationship with him so hopefully I'll be talking to him again... I did mention using ninite to keep adobe updated and he acted like he knew what adobe was but everything I'm saying right now is conjecture based on his body language.
He did mention is coming in through "outlook" so I'm guessing they don't use a web email service. I do know he hosts with mxlogic which I thought was scanned by McAfee... I've never thought they were a good av company but come on... Even the worst should be able to stop an infected PDF.

I'll have to get time to get the links but basically (anecdotal, yes) every thread I read about block size has people saying that storage is the concern and not bandwidth (except for China)... one guy posted that an 8gig block size would require a 100mpbs link... something we have today (when they're saying an 8gig limit would not be around for another 20 years)... so if we can support that now, bandwidth is not the problem...

@_date: 2015-06-23 13:31:11
Over time the difficulty of mining a coin goes up (it's directly related to the amount of hashing power the chain currently receives)... So, over time he should receive fewer and fewer coins for his effort. Now, can be break even? Yes... It's possible... Just not likely.

OK, please explain to me... I run a full node (which I'm still learning... So this means I forward port ~~8337~~ 8333 to my wallet pc and I have around 50 people connected, correct?)... Anyway, I run a full node on the wallet I keep my coins on. I don't have a ton but still 6.5-ish... Is this a problem? I mine and I transact but I don't fully understand the security side. Will this leave me open to hacking? I do have a rather lengthy password on my wallet but it should be noted I also run XT

I'm sorry. I'm not following your question... I'm an IT nerd, AMA! haha
Are you asking what do you do with the backed up files? You go back to a revision of the file that's not encrypted... Backups should have multiple revisions back on a daily, weekly and maybe even monthly basis and they should be encrypted themselves offsite. The virus looks for anything under a drive letter so mapped drives and USB drives are all vulnerable.

Did he track the guy though? I mean, I get he found the wallet but I didn't see how he knew the location?
Admittedly, I don't understand quite a few of his terms. I mine and I do wallets etc but the higher level stuff like this is beyond me.

I'm not technically qualified to answer this but from my limited knowledge I don't see why you couldn't store part of the chain as long as your part was continuous...?
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:11:40
Will it still be quickly at 4tb?
I guess it's all moot if the chain doesn't store account balances and only transactions... In that scenario, the only way one could know an account's worth is my calculation of the entire chain...
@_date: 2015-06-23 11:57:29
What you're asking about is "offline" versus "online" wallets... Offline store the entire block chain, online just check the block chain with their private encryption key.
Everyone here is right: if you use an online wallet, use mycelium and back it up! It'll give you twelve words you NEED TO ALWAYS KEEP. Those twelve words can be used to rebuilt your private key in mycelium on another device if needed.

That's was I was thinking... For "all practical purposes"... However, o. Your comment regarding the bandwidth needed... Someone posted on another thread that if the block size went to 8gigs, we would need around 100mbps of bandwidth... So since we're 1/8000 of that now surely bandwidth isn't the issue? We're his numbers wrong or am I missing something?

@_date: 2018-08-22 16:30:28
You make a lot of assumptions.
The biz I sold was my third business. The other two flopped. I started it with $2000 in cash and 10k available on a credit card. Worked 7am to (often) midnight/1am 6 days a week...I did enjoy it though so it didn't seem like work. The first two flops taught me a _lot_ but only because I didn't allow my pride not to listen to the lessons.
Your response is an excuse. My point is: save all you can, don't make excuses, don't compete with your friends and you may not retire at 40 but you'll be a hell of a lot better off at 40 than anyone around you and probably able to still retire before 65.
If you want help with this, I don't charge. I like seeing people do better. You're welcome to PM me any time.
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:07:31
it's... lonely... and weird... interesting...
see, when you're in business for half your life (all of your adult life), your identity is your business... everyone knows you as the computer tech guy, the business you own, the work you did for them, etc... you identify as that. so, it's been a weird transition. when I first "stopped working" I lost myself for the first five months. I focused so much on "what was next" I didn't get anything else done. I didn't want to be "retired", I wanted to be able to turn down work... to have freedom and control. it took me several months to realize I did have control and being in a situation where I didn't need money meant I needed to focus on things outside of money. so, I started going back to the gym regularly (I used to lift regularly and crossfit but I stopped a couple years ago when they slapped a pacemaker in me)... so I found a new focus: work on my myself again and not worry about the need to feel productive... that took some effort. I focused myself more on my daughter's upcoming college career and other things like that. I'm a ton happier now than I was back in January...
Don't get me wrong, I'm not worth millions. I have enough money that I can do all the forseeable things I want to do... the house is being paid off at the end of this month. I've been doing Airbnb out of it for three years now and I have a plan to move in a friend who's a chef and he wants to turn it in to a full BNB... so there's income there... the business sale provides money every month for 8 years so that gives me something to work with as well before I have to think about touching any investments.
Now that my kid is off to college and her first four years are paid for, I've been doing a lot of travel lately. Texas and Montana are coming up... I just got back from two trips to the Philippines. Iceland is coming up in Oct... you'll notice I'm picking cheap but cool places to go to... there's a reason for that :) I'm actually moving to the Philippines in November... going to let the BNB run at the house and see how I like it in another country. Cost of living is around 40% of where I live now so my money will go even further. Plus, it's a good base to fly out of to visit other cheap countries I've always wanted to see...
So... to answer your question: now I'm pretty happy and content... it took several months of changing how I think about myself to get here though.
edit: I forgot to address the "lonely" comment... meaning: my friends are not retired... they work every day... remember when you skipped school and your friends didn't? it's kinda like that... I find things during the day to do. Sometimes I help my friends with errands, I go to the gym, I work on the house, one day a week I just sit on the couch and watch TV (I never watch TV otherwise so it's my "day off") - I might go work on a friend's house installing their Nest thermostat (specific because it was recent :) )... just whatever... I'm also keeping busy selling things I won't need after the move on facebook. but if you're not busy you're kinda lonely because no one else can come out and play... overall, I'm very happy though :)

from a different angle from the rest of the comments below (even though I agree with all of them so far)... I would say that yes, bitcoin is more "legal"... here's my point: having over $10,000 in cash causes problems... I don't believe (could be wrong here!), it's not legal to transport that kind of cash around but bitcoin is not CASH... according to the US treasury it's an ASSET. which causes all sorts of issues with capital gains etc but since it's not legally CASH it's not burdened with the same legal restrictions.
not an attorney, but that's how I understand it. please correct me if I'm wrong. Always open to learn.

that is awesome... a little advice though: make sure you're still living... saving a ton is great but not at the cost of _everything social_ if that makes sense... if you've got an emergency fund (at least 3 months expenses), your debt over 4% is paid off, your retirement accounts are funded and your investment accounts have extra going in each month... go travel and reward yourself :)

help them... offer to help them a lot... offer to be there when they have questions and actually be there... I have a local car lot to accept BTC as well ( - I sat with them and had them run me through a car purchase as if I was buying it with cash... when I saw where BTC could be interjected, I helped them make the form to accept it (including transaction ID, address paid, amount and fiat price at time of sale all for their accountant) and helped them with the entire process including setting up two trezor devices and their coinbase account so they could convert to USD if needed (they're planning on keeping some as an investment I believe)... it's all about being available and helping them through this process. if they know you're not just "telling them they should do it" and leaving them to their own devices, they're usually much more receptive... next there's a barcade called coin-op that I'm working on having a "Bitcoin-op" night at... :)

Gimme something specific cause all those topics are pretty long :)
and just remember: the biggest benefit to self employment is deductions... learn the tax system.... I started Airbnb by making my home a commercial project. One of my LLCs pays me monthly to rent the home from me and in turn it rents it on Airbnb (this reduces my liability as well as converts X amount per month from short term rental income... which is taxed as current income tax rate.... to long term rental income... which is taxed at 15% flat... saves me around $2500 per year in taxes, free money in my pocket... and I can deduct improvements to the home that I'm using myself as well)

I started in Aug of 1999 and sold this past Dec... during that time I saw the margins for hardware go from 60% to 10% and now it's been climbing back up a bit over the past few years... in Aug of 08 I was handed divorce papers (for those who don't know, that's when the gov finally admitted we were in a recession, business had not been good the past year) and I had a bankruptcy in 2011... used CC's to make payroll so I wouldn't have to lay anyone off.
Since then I restructured, got rid of problem clients and kept my high margin ones... we went from a "retail/service" shop that did 800k+ a year and maybe a 7% net margin to a business that did $300k per year and a 40% net margin...
part of my restructure was moving to recurring revenue... we had 500-600 machines with antivirus on them we maintained at a price of $55 per machine per year and a cost of around $9... there's all sorts of things you can do... I only kept enough inventory to fix emergency items, anything else I ordered and could have in the store next day (we're halfway between two major shipping hubs for Newegg and Amazon)
I give you all this not to boast but to tell you: if you need help, I'm more than willing, just let me know what you need. I'm on the top now but I've been at the bottom... everything in between I've seen...

I understand what you're getting at but that's not how it has to work... Maybe that's how it works for you but not how it has to. By your logic I shouldn't sell antivirus either. It's very simple to install a program, gives them the basic run down of how it helps, stress again that nothing is perfect etc. An informed customer is one that understands the risk and doesn't rush to blame the IT guy.
Now, ymmv as I deal with only customers I chose to and, for the most part, not the general public, but I can tell you this is how it works for me.

Unfortunately, it wont matter... if we lost connectivity to the rest of the chain, we start forming our own chain... so let's say we get disconnected and we form our own network... who's mining for us? What happens when we connect back to the whole?
We lose all our transactions, that's what happens... because it took us a while to get miners on our chain, our chain will be shorter, so... we lose all the transactions.
Unless we form our own version of btc... but that poses other problems.

So. Honestly... You think there's a better chance of electric going out on a massive scale than internet?
Many major cities are fed with 1-2 fiber trunks. Let those go dark... who's paying for the electric during this crisis to run the cell towers and the network routers?
The internet is great at routing around sections that are down but if something happened like the scale he's talking, the internet -will- be down.

I wish this were true... I've filled out several online questionnaires specifically stating what I'm doing and going to companies that cover "real" BnBs and I've been turned down _every_ time. I've contacted my own insurance agent as well as six others (all clients of mine)... explained exactly what I'm doing here and every one of them have turned up empty handed. It may just be that Loyds is all that's out there? Just seems odd to me...
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:49:33
Well that's valid... I mean, I can see that as being higher risk but I would think that this risk would be offset by the lower risk of someone trying to burn my property down with me in the other room... Also not in the insurance biz though :)
@_date: 2016-12-26 23:41:24
Check that insurance. I've been digging in to the insurance issue for nearly three months now and here's what I've learned so far: 
A) airbnb insurance is liability only... IE only if the guest gets hurt. It does not cover contents or damage to structure. 
B) supplemental only... So if you don't have primary homeowners, they don't cover anything... Which leads me to my next point 
C) after calling or emailing 24 different insurance companies, only one will cover airbnb and several have said they would drop me if I had a policy with them and I did an airbnb: Loyd's of London will cover me... And they're almost exactly 100% more than I'm currently paying
I love doing airbnb in my home, I rent out two of my four bedrooms on it, but the insurance thing has me really freaked out. 
I post this partly hoping you've found something I haven't :)
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:48:03
Yeah, basically what I've been hearing is "we don't know enough about this situation to want to cover it"... So I'm thinking they haven't figured their risk models yet... I did change my search in Google though to looking for companies that deal specifically with BNB's and I'm getting better responses. At least they're wanting to talk to me instead of shutting me down at interview.

True but when you're talking your extra two rooms bring in around $1000/month extra, the extra part of the insurance is taking 12-14%, it's a pretty decent chunk... Mostly I'm frustrated with the inability to find someone to cover me. They say there's a problem because I'm sharing rooms (bathroom, living room, dining and kitchen) but I don't see how this is any different from any other real BNB.

I'm moving there in November to try and spread the word. The Philippines is a perfect place for BTC to take hold.
Hopefully I can get a college to allow me to teach for them. So far only one has replied with interest.

Cheapest solution that I've set up for people is a cheap Android phone. Encrypt it, store your wallets in the encrypted space and only get it out when you need it.
You can pick one up for $50-80 and it stores a lot more coins than a trezor or ledger... Doesn't need cell service... Just make sure you back up your seeds.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:55:58
I'm open to suggestions and ideas... My insurance agent has been running in to the same issues though. Can you suggest a company I could call?

Well I can tell you it's not an accounting problem because we never get that far. We never even get far enough for me to tell them I have an LLC.
The moment I tell them that I share spaces with guests, the process is over. 
Call one... See for yourself :)

Ok... Those are not 5 min answers... Just fyi for anyone looking to help out, there's some pretty deep questions on there. I'll have to do it from my laptop later today if I get time.

I've been to the Philippines and I decided to move there as a result of my visit... What would you like to know?
@_date: 2016-12-29 17:02:12
My LLC handles my airbnb property... The moment I tell them I share living space with the guests (bathroom, living room, dining room and kitchen) they deny my application. That seems to be the point of contention with everyone... But other than bathroom, how is that different than any other BNB? They can never answer that question...

 was the latest company I tried to get insurance with... here's the exchange as copied from my email after I filled out the online form and an agent emailed me back... I'll remove names of course and put it in top to bottom order (as opposed to my email which is backwards from that)...
Agent's first email to me:
Dear Comp21-
Thank you for contacting Proper Insurance.  Please find attached your detailed insurance proposal.  We strongly encourage you to read our Frequent Questions.  
Insurance for Vacation Rentals:  The recent growth of the short-term rental marketplace has exposed gaps in traditional insurance coverage.  A homeowner’s or landlord policy could rightfully deny any claim involving a short-term renter as the result of a “business activity exclusion.”  This includes both property damage and liability.  Proper recognized these gaps and developed a custom-penned, Lloyd’s of London insurance policy.  It’s all-inclusive comprehensive coverage, designed for the unique risks of a vacation rental property.  It is written to replace your current coverage.
CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE POLICY - Same Day Coverage Available.  Upon completion you will receive a binder email at which time you can cancel your existing coverage.  Proper will also provide your certificate of insurance to any applicable parties (bank, mortgage co, property manager).
Coverage Comparison:  Not all insurance is created equally, beware if your current coverage states any of the following:
                Premise Liability
                Personal Liability
                Dwelling Policy
                Loss of Rents
                Liquor Liability Exclusion
*If you have a competitive quote, or simply don’t understand the current coverage you have, please let us know as insurance is complicated.  We will take the time to explain why the Proper policy is the most comprehensive coverage available today.
Proper Insurance Policy Highlights: Designed to replace your current coverage.
	Commercial Package Policy: coverage for building, contents, liability, and income.
	Building &amp; Contents: special cause of loss (all risk) with replacement cost valuation (new for old).
	Liability: $1,000,000/$2,000,000 in commercial general liability (extends beyond premise).
	Income: actual loss sustained business income coverage with no time limit.
	Additional $1,000,000 in personal liability when rental “doubles” as primary residence.
	Liability coverage enhancement for animals/pets &amp; liquor.
	Liability coverage extended over amenities: pools, bicycles, small watercraft, golf carts, rec area, + more.
	Property coverage enhancement for theft and damage caused by a renter.
	Vacancy clause removed with no standard occupancy restrictions.
	Underwritten by Lloyd’s of London, AM Best’s Rated A.
Thanks for your time.

My 1st reply:
Sorry for the late reply. Thanksgiving week saw me on the couch with a fever. Now that I’m feeling better, I’d like to get some more information.
I read the FAQ and I want to make 100% sure on a few things:
a)	this policy replaced my homeowners, correct?
b)	What about earthquake coverage? I pay for that separately now… can we add it to this or should I continue to keep that other policy?
c)	Can you give me a break down of how the premium is figured from the different categories of coverage? (i.e., how much of the policy is “replacement value” vs “replacement of rental income” etc)… I may want to adjust some of those areas.
As it sits now, the policy is almost exactly 3x what I pay for homeowners now so I need to see where I can work this in to the budget.
his 1st reply:
Looking at your listing, it shows that you are just renting a room in your house and not a separate domicile.  This is what we call “room sharing”, when common spaces such as the living room etc are shared with the owner of the home.  We do not insure for this type of rental.  It would need to have its own separate entrance, bathroom, etc. for our policy to cover it.  
Still though, to answer your questions in case I am wrong:
-	This would replace your homeowners
-	Earthquake coverage would be purchased separately, which is standard for the industry.
-	For a breakdown, is there something specific that you are looking for?  Cost should not be a factor, the correct coverage should be the main concern.  With that said, we can always adjust values.
The reason that the cost is higher than your homeowners is because of the increased liability exposure.  We have the most competitive pricing on the market, but vacation rental insurance will almost always be a bigger expense than homeowners.
A guy named Jeff
my disappointed reply back:
Well damn… that’s what I’m hearing a lot of: no insurance coverage because it’s a shared space listing.
What do all the airbnb’s out there do for coverage then? Every “private room” listed on there is the same situation and setup that I have…
his reply back, which I've already tried to get "proper BNB coverage" I'm being told the same thing... sharing rooms changes things and we don't cover that...
Usually they just rely on what Airbnb provides or pursue a bed and breakfast type of policy, which we do not cover.
A guy named Jeff
Up until now I've been simply contacting any company I can find that, through Google, seems to have any connection to vacation rental insurance. i'll start looking specifically for a BnB company I guess. Funny thing is: I found proper.insure by looking on the airbnb forums and someone else claimed they had coverage... and now I can't get it.
Anyway, I appreciate any direction you can lead me. If you know of a company that does this, I'm definitely all ears.

Simple: the gov will simply require all businesses to get customer data for all transactions and verify it... Most will end up verifying with credit card info even though you're not using it.
Then they know who is spending what and where. It's like any money laundering system... If they see you spending $500 in btc somewhere then they know you made $500 in btc somewhere else. Then they audit you and the burden of proof is on you.
I could see the gov trying to use btc tax evasion as a way to create a large central database of all online transactions.

@_date: 2015-08-08 23:48:34
The biggest thing you need to concern yourself with is that for tax purposes the US treats btc as an asset, not currency... So, hold your btc for a while and the price changes? Now you have to file capital gains/losses on the part you sold versus what you took it for... Get 2 btc at $300 ea in jan then convert 0.2 at $280 in Nov then take another 0.8 at $275 then sell 1.65 at $295 then get another.... Etc etc then you also have to figure out which parts are long term vs short term etc... It's a nightmare to keep track of.

So to summarize my trip to Amsterdam and trying to spend bitcoin:
Kobalt cafe: takes it at the register, part of his point of sale... For some reason my transaction wouldn't post to him through his WiFi, he had to reboot it first, otherwise, great!
Warie's Thai food: they take btc to the managers phone, not part of point of sale, he will take btc at exchange rate for food and buy btc at 10%. They did have an ATM but he stated theirs and two others have been stolen recently so don't believe the listings on airbitz
Azarius: no clue how he takes bitcoin. Listed here because he's on airbitz. I went in to buy something/ask questions... Stood there nearly ten mins while he chatted with someone else. Ended up leaving... But for those looking to buy a brownie or smokes, I didn't see any in the shop and I have been unable to find a head shop that takes btc

Well, the manager told me they were in the process of getting a new "till" which I assume is a point of sale terminal... So I'd have to pay with btc when he was around. He gave me his schedule... So I paid him directly to the phone wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:26:38
No, he's absolutely right... No transactions = no btc... And the miners process transactions. That's why I worry that china has around 60% of the hashing power right now (well, did a few weeks ago when I checked last).

That's better than "good advice", it's perfect... I would add though: do not put a significant chunk of your savings in to btc period... From a financial standpoint, it's way too risky... I mean, if you're OK with it, go for it, but if you don't have at least six months of expenses in cash, I wouldn't touch something like this.

Oh no, that probably wont happen. Most new versions of the virus just go through and encrypt until they stop (either by av kicking in, finishing the encryption of all the files or power going out... Which happened to a customer of mine today actually)... Once the routine is interrupted, the virus goes away.
If they got two infections close to each other, you may have double encryption but you still won't have double infection.
Now, not to step on toes (IT guys are pretty territorial :) ) but get them on ninite to update at least adobe and java. I sell the free version to my customers for $30 per pc per year... I set up the free one as a scheduled task to run every day and make money on it :)

I would suggest localbitcoins.com - buy your coins from someone face to face for multiple reasons:
* you're new... see how it works in person!
* you're new... get a relationship with someone who's probably really excited to talk about bitcoin and teach you things!
* much simpler to get an account going
basically you make an account, search in your area for people selling coins then message them, arrange a meeting, bring cash and a bitcoin wallet on your cell phone... simple

"Currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of. Historically, most currencies were based on physical commodities such as gold or silver, but fiat money is based solely on faith. Fiat is the Latin word for "it shall be"."
my argument has been that Bitcoin is fiat, which ok, technically it's not because it has not been declared "legal tender" but that's the ONLY difference between it and fiat currency... it's still based solely on faith and supply/demand... it's not backed by anything physical and therefore is subject to many of the same whims of fiat currency. Which, for the purposes of OP's argument with his grandfather, is the point his grandfather was trying to make.

So no soup? And they do take btc directly right? Some of these places have an ATM and they say they take btc but they really don't...
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:45:51
That's not the definition of fiat... Decreeing it has value in comparison to gold, silver or any other tangible asset is the exact OPPOSITE of fiat... You're confusing "decreeing it is to be used as legal tender" with "tying it to a tangible asset"... Bitcoins are not tied to a tangible asset however, no, they are not required to be used as legal tender.
For all intents and purposes, the comparison to the US dollar being fiat is based on whether it's backed by tangible, physical assets... Neither the US dollar nor bitcoins are backed by physical assets... Therefore, they have that in common and are, for practical argument with the OP's grandfather, both " fiat". 
If he's going to talk to his grandfather about it and convince him he should take btc seriously, splitting hairs on whether a country "requires it as legal tender" is missing the point and will not garner us anther supporter. His grandfather likes gold because it's physically backed value. That's the important part to his discussion.

Yes, good qualities but gold is still backed by being physical... It's a physical asset, USD and btc are not. That's the difference I'm trying to get through to you. Yes, all three have "good qualities for use as money" but that doesn't change the fact that gold is physical and the other two are not. Btc and USD are both backed by desire and nothing else.

So I'm drunk so take this for what it's worth... But I've been wondering if the run up on alts is partly due to Bitcoin unlimited which was just a scam to devalue/make people lose faith in Bitcoin and thereby jump to alts so bitmain can get a good price for their scrypt miners (which were 6-12 months old before they sold them to us anyway... So really, to get a good price for the coins they mined with the before they sold us equipment)
@_date: 2016-02-06 16:53:04

In case I'm incapacitated, I have a trust friend who has the code to my safe that has all this stuff written down inside... Since I run a full node, I wiped the old wallet.dat file, made an empty one and run the node from that...
@_date: 2016-02-06 16:53:52

@_date: 2015-07-27 14:08:37
I'll agree with most of what you say except "gold, silver and now bitcoin have value from voluntary consensus"...
Technically that's the only reason the US dollar has value is because we agree that it does... Yes, we were told to use it, but if it loses value significantly you better believe people will move to something else.
Also, gold and silver have value because of their physical rarity and their usefulness.. Not because we just all got together one day and said " this random slab of metal is important"

C) if their servers go down, what then?
@_date: 2015-08-21 07:58:44
It wasn't the website they were using, they got large enough to be noticed... As it was explained to me, legally speaking, every person on localbitcoins.com or through mycelium trader (ie anyone selling btc, the method used is unimportant) is acting as a money exchange and therefore must be compliant with US financial law... It's a giant load of bullshit but still true... The guys in Florida transacted around $1.8m... Which got federal attention.

Well, here's the issue... I'm the trustee of her estate and while I can spend money, I try to stay away from anything that could be construed as benefiting myself as well... The btc accounts can be watched by the accountant I hired, but who's to say I'm not using the trezor myself as well?
That's why I'm looking for a free solution.
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:23:07
If it has monetary value, It's a taxable gain. Not because you said it has value but because the market does. So yes, if you made a coin and the market traded it at a certain value, everyone would owe taxes on their gain.
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:31:23
Edit: just watch this and tell me where you have questions
If you want sources, did you read the article I gave you in my literal first reply?
As far as your last paragraph, again, you don't get it... In a fork, you are GIVEN the other coin. Therefore he was GIVEN bch. 
When a coin forks it does NOT change the market cap of the other coin in any measurable, repeatable way. Therefore it is not accepted as a stock split by the US government and therefore it is taxed as a dividend payment.
@_date: 2018-11-12 20:31:01
I'm sorry, I'll not following what you're saying/asking here... There's no savings over one or the other since there's no choice. You don't get to pick. Paying on the dividend is simply how it's done unless you're asking about committing tax fraud.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:46:39
That's what the numbers imply but it's hard to tell for sure... All we know right now is that between an increase in segwit usage and multiple exchanges recently batching the mempool is manageable again.
@_date: 2018-11-13 00:19:58
I'm telling you, very directly, that your thinking is wrong. That's how I'm addressing what you're "bringing up". 
A stock split is splitting up an existing entity .. So both parts equal the value of the original, single company. So, again, there's no extra value to tax.
A hard fork is creation of a new asset. It is an increase in overall value. Bch forking from btc does not drive down the price of btc because they're not related. They're not the same "company" they're merely using the same network resource, which is not the same as using the same bank account (as they would have been if this was a split of a company).
I also never said to sell your btc. I have no idea where you got that impression from. I merely said you have to pay taxes on a hard fork (which you do) and used the btc/bch fork as an example of one of the many many forks you have to account for.
HE DIDN'T PAY FOR BCH so your last comment makes no sense... Bch was a fork that cost us nothing. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE PAID FOR BTC... All that matters, to the US government, is what the value of the coins he was GIVEN in a FORK on the day they became available to him. Period.
With all the things you've assumed, very incorrectly, that I've said in this, I have to wonder if you're not trolling me. There's nothing simpler explanation I can give you to explain how this works.
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:37:48
Important tax advice (assuming you're in the US):
You were paid bch and btg among a few other alt coins due to the age of this wallet.
You will owe capital gains based on the day you obtained control over those coins... Ie: today.
DO NOT FORGET TO CLAIM THEM FOR 2018.
Taxes are based on price on date of control times the number of coins you have.
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:32:59
I have the source that I teach this for a living at the University and produced videos explaining this. However, if you want to read Forbes: 
Now, you might see in there where they say you "could" report it this way... That's them hedging themselves. If you have an increase in net worth, you owe taxes to the US government... Period.
My accountant did my taxes as they've done every year however, I they took my class to figure out how to account for crypto taxes because, well, I'm their only client with this issue :)
And I don't know what you mean by "which side of the split"? If I own 50 btc already and suddenly I'm given 50 bch, I had a dividend of 50 bch and owe taxes on the value of the bch the day I received them.
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:51:19
ok, your post makes no sense... I still don't think you're understanding... claiming it's a dividend costs you, the taxpayer, money the next time you file... there's no "stretch" here. If you, the tax payer, tries to claim it's a split, that means you pay no tax... if you claim it as a dividend, you pay tax on it...
so you saying "I'm not the one you'll have to convince" makes no sense.. it implies that I'm trying to claim it's a dividend to save me money yet, it's the only option that actually costs me money.
on top of that, it doesn't matter how you and I view it... tax-wise a fork is treated as dividend payment and you owe taxes on it.
you do realize that stock splits are NOT taxed and dividends ARE taxed, right? I mean, we're on that page together...? therefore, claiming a fork as a dividend means you DO pay taxes on it so it is NOT a tax AVOIDANCE approach...
@_date: 2016-09-24 18:46:56
sorry for the late reply... I'm looking at your software now. I have a key that I saved in an encrypted database and it came out kinda corrupted. like the last five characters are just truncated. I was hoping to use this to start with the part of the key I have and see if it can find the balance from that point forward...?
@_date: 2018-11-12 06:58:47
Edit: to clarify what I'm saying below, a hard fork is treated as a dividend payment. He will owe taxes based on that initially from the price he received the forked coins at... After that, when he sells those coins, that's when capital gains will be calculated.
Edit: also removed redundant info... It's 1am here. I'm tired and rambling.
Incorrect... And correct...
REestablishing control of coins is only relevant if he paid taxes at the time he originally received control of the coins. Since he lost this wallet, I'm assuming he did not have control of the coins at the time of the fork and assuming he didn't pay taxes previously (obviously)... Therefore, he owes taxes on the coins at the time/price he gained control of them.
Yes, without a single doubt, this is exactly how this works in the US.
@_date: 2018-11-12 15:30:17
I don't think you understand what a fork is...
If I have 50 btc that I spent $1, what I spent for it is irrelevant... I was given, in a fork, 50 more bch at, let's say, $10 per coin so I have to claim $500 in income because my assets went up by $500 by being given 50 bch at $10 per bch... There's no split of btc, there's an addition of bch. The bch is the dividend because that's what was added.
As far as the IRS caring that you're moving money between wallets, they don't... What do you mean by that specifically?
As far as the stock split question: if you have 50 shares of Philip Morris at $100 and Kraft splits from it giving you 50 shares of Kraft at $20, your PM stock is adjusted to a price of $80... So your assets stay the same... 50 plus 50 equals 50 (the original price)
A hard fork is not a split... A stock split is a company spinning off part of itself and is not a taxable event because the two parts of the original company equal the value together of the original company... Ie no additional wealth is created so no tax is owed. A hard fork is a creation of wealth. When bch was created, it did not and logically should not affect the price of btc. Therefore, new wealth was created and taxes are owed.

That was not because it "took off" per se, it was because most exchanges did not batch their transactions. Right now Bitcoin is just as popular and the mempool is practically empty. I sent $300 for 7 SATs /byte and I was in the next block.

Afaik, some loans will have a "balloon payment" issue if you pay ahead here in the US but I've never seen a mortgage over here like that. The only "penalty" I'll have is capital gains on my profits. I've held them longer than a year though so it'll only be 15%.

Oh yeah... I could reinvest the rental income too. Don't know why that didn't occur to me. That's $3k a month roughly... Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:07:15
Yeah if it keeps going up. Based on previous growth it's absolutely better to keep it in crypto... But the converse is "debt free" and "no promise of continued growth"... You're right though. This is exactly what I've been weighing out.
However, side note: my home is a commercial project (bought for the Airbnb) so I'm paying just under 6%. Doesn't change the numbers much but just fyi
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:55:00
Technically, sure, but you can't see what he's implying and where this is going for him. Which means he will be.
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:04:23
What he's telling you is you're violating US tax law. If you don't want to report it, that's between you and the government but you're still in violation of how bitcoin is taxed. With the semi-recent announcement from the IRS that they control enough nodes to be able to track transactions, you're taking an ignorant and unnecessary risk with your future trying to hide money like that.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:00:31
Yeah, that's the way I'm leaning... The only other thought that bothers me is this statement:
"If you bought $500 in bitcoin in 2009 you'd have $25 million now!"
That's true only if you held it that entire time... If you sold it before now (like I'm looking currently, even if it is to pay off the house) you wouldn't have that growth...
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:41:03
Only the interest is... With a business though, I've got a ton of deductions anyway. Plus, by using this place as an Airbnb, I can write off renovations etc (my house was built in 1870 so there's a lot of renovations needed :) )
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:57:31
The only reason I'm at this point is because I only cash out when I can do something big... Well nothing big has shown up until now :)

A few years ago when btc was around $185 I have away a few hundred worth to people as I mined it... Not a single thank you.
Except the bartender I tipped with it... But he's local :(

Well I have a static with plenty of bandwidth so I figured "why not"... But yeah, maybe I need to rethink this.

Well this explains why my internet connection has been shit lately... Time to take it down for a bit.
@_date: 2015-09-08 18:56:36
Ah... Thank you. That makes sense... It was odd that all my miners all screwed up at the same time and none are in the same physical location.

PM me... I teach an intro class at Southeast Missouri State that I can send you.

Because Bitcoin is DECENTRALIZED... Ie there's no Central authority to mandate something. If you want to use it, use it. That's your call.... Ie, you are your own bank, you are individually in charge of yourself and how you operate

If he doesnt have any btc yet, send me his address and I'll send him some. I love encouraging new adopters.

I agree with you op, knowing if the hodl'ers are drying up supply is important... 
Wow is right though... Wtf is that guy's problem? Calling for "more information" on any topic is never a bad thing.
@_date: 2015-11-22 02:04:39
Holy shit this could not be more wrong... Unless he's paying for electricity... Then it's completely correct.
However, I don't pay for electric and my $3200 investment has more than doubled this year.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:57:26
You really like it? I'm not done, that's why I'm posting here but you're welcome to what's here so far. I'm needing ideas of what I should still cover and I need verification that my over simplified explanation of some things isn't now incorrect.
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:56:17
Technically they're all made up... Just like bitcoin and USD :)

I have three wallets I maintain..  two on a trezor and one wallet.dat file.
The wallet file only has a couple coins. The other 30+ are on the trezor.
The wallet file is kept in an encrypted database (1password database) and the trezor is in my gun safe.
I have two people I trust that have the combination to my safe. Upon my death, they open the safe and in the safe is a red folder. The folder has:
A) instructions for contacting my cousin who understands bitcoins
B) the password and instructions on how to access my database
C) the recovery key to the trezor device along with the device in a zip lock bag that has the key and the pin#
D) a copy of my trust that handles the rest of my estate, what to do with the house, business, etc a list of people I trust for certain duties to handle them for my daughter (like, let roommate run the airbnb rooms in the house to continue to pay it off), etc
@_date: 2015-11-05 12:55:48
Well true... But a location would be a big (possibly big) indicator. I mean... If we are seeing tons of buying in china, well, reading the news would probably tell us why... But if we see tons of buying in Kansas... Who the hell knows :)
I'm mostly wondering if my theory of being able to track it like I listed is feasible/correct and based on the replies, it seems to be.
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:50:18
I have two friends who know the code to my safe... Inside my safe is a red envelope with my trust docs, will, etc... my cousin takes control from this point... specific to your question though: inside is also instructions on how to get ahold of another cousin of mine who understands bitcoin with my keys printed and my trezor device
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:22:00
There was never a "creation of tax" in 2017.. Bitcoin and cryptos were ALWAYS an asset and ALWAYS taxed. It was just CLARIFIED in 2017
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:33:52
I bought $12k of eth at an average of $192 a couple days ago.
It's long term, I agree, but fuck...
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:58:38
I thought about paper wallets but I was worried that "why/how does it work" would be too technical... Making it simple is eluding me at the moment.
I'm definitely going to add cost analysis for mining though. Good call.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:09:39
funny how you're both really just watching the same happiness
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:23:45
chinese miners using a subsidy is not the same as "leeching" or "free electric". now, will it be profitable for them when the subsidies run out? probably not, but the market will adjust like it always does. Bitcoin could run as it does now on a MUCH lower hash rate so, should the miners go away, the difficulty of mining just becomes easier is all...
But, on a side note: if you think "home miners are using either their parent's electricity" or "stretching their landlord's mistake of including electricity" is a "high percentage" of the miners out there, sorry, I'm going to have to disagree... problem is: as far as I can tell, neither of us can back up our opinions as I don't see any studies or surveys... (of course, i'm on my phone so if you find one, I'd love to see it, seriously)
@_date: 2015-10-18 15:34:51
Yep... Definitely ddos... My sonicwall was going nuts over it too. Maybe I should throw the node back up if they've stopped.
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:25:14
I have my s5 in my basement (good place for it for the heat issue) on the same circuit as my deep freezer, a 16-port Poe switch, 5-bay Nas and router... just use an online volt-amperes calculator, add 25% to what it says your amps are and go from there to see what you can still put on the circuit.
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:11:08
what percentage of miners do you think are not paying for electric?
@_date: 2015-10-18 01:23:36
I ran (and still sometimes run) an xt node but I noticed that I kept getting ddos'd... Someone was killing my bandwidth so I gave it up.

That's what I did... Sold my business in the US, taught cryptos for a bit, now I have a business in Manila and I've never been happier. Cryptos are my safety net... Never sold any since 2011, never traded, just sitting there if I need them and everything else burns down :)
Good luck! If you decide to move to SE Asia, you're welcome to PM questions about that too
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:29:32
I completely agree .. I used to teach a little on cryptos at my local University and online and I had to just stop. The amount of constant fighting FUD I had to do was exhausting and, SURPRISE! everyone knew more than me...

Shameless self promotion here but I used to teach an intro crypto class at SEMO University in Missouri. This class was designed for complete beginners. Those with NO technical or other knowledge. I designed it so your grandmother could come away with something out of it... No trading, no heavy language, just a good solid foundation of how the tech works, how to keep your money safe, differences in certain coins, how to spot scams etc. 
Yes, I'm proud of the work we did and what we taught...
You can get it on udemy for $13... Http://
Added bonus: you now have my Reddit ID so you can ask me questions :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:34:34
This is helping :)

that's literally my point... most of my holdings are in BTC and I don't like ETH for moral reasons (from address?!? wtf!!! corporate involvement!?!?!?!) but the fact of the matter is: if we don't fix this shit, we're gonna lose.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:11:40
Honestly, I stepped out of keeping up with all things crypto about 18 months ago so I couldn't tell you the current state of a lot of projects. I just got sick of all the politics, in fighting and people who knew more than I did, even though I've been in this space since early 2011.
My previous thoughts were most were a scam and I've been honored (?) to have been right as several have been taken down by authorities since. Since I can't tell you specifically who's out there doing this, I can tell you this: just look at the money. If even 5% of what they're claiming doesn't make sense, they're probably lying to you about the other 95%, they're just better at covering that part up... Bitconnect was one scam I used to rally against. They'd give presentations within a few hours' drive and I'd go to call them out publicly before anyone else bought in and lost their money... Biggest reason they stood out: by their own numbers they were 35% short on their ability to pay. Which means membership dues were covering that, which means eventually they'd run out of new members to pay existing members with: scam.
Personally, if I were to do a mining group, I'd pool together with my friends and put it somewhere where you managed it. Keep the labor costs cheap and split the takings between you... Having said that, understand that if you're in most any Western country, keeping track of little payments for tax purposes can be a real headache for miners.

I'm going to Paris the 27th with my daughter. Can you tell me two things:
A) how bad is it with the terrorists attacks right now? Should we be concerned flying in?
B) how accurate is coinmap.org?
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:03:22
"filthy USD"
"Not convinced it's going lower (in value of filthy USD)"
Huh? If you don't like USD, why do you care what the value in USD is?
Why not just not be "edgy" and admit that you're holding your btc because, later, you think you can get more USD? It's ok to say that.

Shameless self plug but I have an online class .. it's $13 on udemy (PM me and I'll send you a half off coupon). I taught a 101 course at the University down from my house in Missouri and this udemy course is the video version of it.
It's very intro level and designed for non technical people. Added bonus: if you have questions you can message me :)
I go over how to spot scams, secure your money, use hardware wallets, what seeds are and why they're important, how Bitcoin and a few other coins work, etc...
Edit: forgot the website to find me  will take you to my class

Is it true there's 700+ locations in Paris the police won't patrol? This is what I'm being told here in the states...
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:35:42
ok, so what denotes that unspent output is legit? what says "debit this account"?
I'm starting to put my head around it I think... that's why people refer to mining accounts as having "dust"... tons of little +'s so to speak...?
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:32:07
That makes me feel better. Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:10:37
I can promise you, you'll make money... I have$5000 invested and at last check, before the price increases, I've made back close to $9000. I have five s5's, one s4 and one s7... I only pay electric on one s5.
Now, you have circuit considerations to think about... Most residential buildings have all outlets in the same room on a single 15amp circuit... So, that's roughly one s5, a TV and some entertainment equipment or one s5 and a moderate PC or just a single s7.
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:37:55

I think what comforts Americans is knowing that if they are shot at, there's an option to shoot back.
However, I'll definitely take your advice. I was more looking for info on how bad it is vs how bad we're being told it is. We have no plans to change our plans.

Saying that predicted Bitcoin is like saying you invented the remote control because one day you were upset you had to get up to change the channel.
