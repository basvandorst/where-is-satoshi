Oh, well sadly it is not doling out 1 BTC.  But I requested 1 BTC from the link posted below, and they said that my 1 BTC was on the way.

r/Bitcoin, you guys are the reason I own Bitcoin.  You're the reason I made bank off of buying the lows and selling the highs.  You're the reason I lost hundreds of dollars on dice, and learned that I should never gamble again.  You're the reason I "earned" all that money back through trading alt-currencies.  And you're the reason that all my profits go straight the hell back into Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:26:56
Panic selling all the BTC I own!!!  Thanks so much for warning us!!

For awhile they wouldn't send my my 2-factor verification text so I couldn't login.  And then once I/they got that to finally work, they blocked my account for 24 hours due to "to many failed login attempts."  Understandable.  I contacted them asking them to lift the ban, but I simply got a form message back.  Only problem I've had from them, though.

When I saw the front page of reddit, my heart leaped in anticipation of a price dive!  No such luck :(

hell, it works damn good for that percentage.

I finally caught one of these in time! :D

I bought into CENTS at .00000001.  So yeah, I'm a happy man today.
How about you give me your bitcoin....  And i'll invest it for you ;)
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:26:03
Wow, what a shame he decided to share his personal views on his business Twitter.

About 8 months ago I had 80k in my bank account.  I had recently graduated, got a job, was about to get married, and was in the market for a small house.  
I still have daydreams about giving in to the temptation I had to dump everything into bitcoin.  Hell, i'd be fucking rolling in money right now, if I had done that.  But instead, I bought the house, waited on bitcoin because I was unsure about it and wanted to do research, and then recently I purchased 3 BTC in ranges from 750 - 1000 USD.
So yeah, I think "what if" all the time...  If only I had paid more attention to this shit back in college.  But it is a lesson learned.  Of course, dumping my house fund into BTC would have been irresponsible as hell, and barring knowing what I know now, I made the wise decision.
All that to say, don't beat yourself up over past inaction.  Life and BTC were not as clear cut then as they are now, looking back on them.  Just pick up where you are, get in with an amount that you can afford, and live life, with an open eye for future opportunities.
It's already been said on this thread, but it's just money.
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:00:12
Lol, newsweek.  Still, these cards look alright. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:08:53
So, I bought in at 1000.  Right before the China crash...  And I am holding until Hell freezes over, because 1) I don't need the money right now, and 2) I believe in the future of Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:58:00
Lol, I just won my first game of Rock Paper Sissors, and doubled the money you guys gave me to start my account.  Thanks!  My account is only worth pennies of course, and sadly no one is on to play with me right now :(
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:12:36
Yo, your faucet just said that it sent my account 1 BTC...

How does your calculation method decide where I should invest?
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:02:58
Buying either BTC or LTC right now is the moneymaking opportunity of the Century. I don't want my grandchildren asking why they aren't part of the new 1%, so I emptied their parents' college funds today to fomo in.  A new world is swiftly approaching, of which we shall be the new financial elite. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:03:56
I heard rumors about Coinbase adding it next week, but gotta' be careful with rumors.  I'm just putting a couple thousand into LTC now in anticipation.  More when the actual news comes through.

Hey now, let's keep things civil here.  Lots of good projects are being presented on this thread, and there's no reason to attack a project not your own. The koinify team's mantra is due diligence, I'm sure they'll be fine. 
In other matters, nice brand new account :P
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:52:17
I trade as well, and have found it compelling.  I've earned money, and lost money, but finally I am at a place where I have the skills and discipline necessary to make consistent, modest profits. Through the month of January, I turned 2 BTC into 6, through only trading the safe and obvious movements. 
But on the flipside, I've known a lot of people who lost their shirts with trading, because they viewed it as a "get rich quick" scheme.  It definitely isn't for everyone!
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:56:26
I really like this concept, for a decentralized, open source, altcoin marketplace.  Too many of these online marketplaces suffer from a centralized point of failure, let's fix that.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:48:04
I had a long discussion with my wife concerning the merits of BTC, and then we decided to put 2k into it.   Then the price halved over the next 3 days. Twas tense there for a bit, but things are looking up now.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:26:22
Yeah, I bought in yesterday at $1000.00...  But I'm in for the long haul, so I just wish I had some extra liquid fiat so I could get more BTC, but this time at $850.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:44:09
Hmmm... I haven't come up with any novel ideas so far, but just wanted to drop in and shake your hand.  Kudos to you, buddy–you're spreading goodwill, and propagating Bitcoin!  Keep it up.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:42:25
Yeah, reading that thread (and others like it) helped me hold my resolve through the tumble :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:40:01
Damn straight I did!
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:59:35
^This.  I bought into bitcoin because I believe in it's long-term relevancy.  I bought in at 1k, because that is where it settled (albeit, not for long) after diving from 1.3k, so it seemed like a good time to get in (on what i thought was the dip).  I would have bought more at the $500 mark, however, I used up all my investing monies the first time around.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:58:41
Haha, I wish I had the money for double digit BTC and a bottle of bourbon.  Someday!
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:17:36
The race is on!
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:01:49
Sweet!  Because the Bitcoin I purchased from Coinbase is still "pending," you just gave me the very first Bitcoin I've ever owned :D  Friend &lt;3

Welcome to Reddit, and Bitcoin, Matt. As A new user myself (of both BTC &amp; Reddit), I have found this subreddit infinitely helpful. Furthermore, I received my first ever portion of BTC from someone on r/Bitcoin (named Godfreee). As I just purchased 2 BTC of my own, I will pass his gift on to you–use it well!
+$.20 verify
Edit:  Apparently the wonderful rollercoaster that is BTC has devalued my tip from Godfree, to the point that I can't hit the minimum amount.  Oh well, I'll just try again once BTC rebounds to 1k.  All the same, my sentiments remain!
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:43:39
sadly, I had no more money to put in after my initial purchase.  Frankly, after it dropped from 1300 down to 1000, it leveled out for a bit and I thought the correction was done.  Oops.  
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:39:51
After checking my options, I decided to go with Cryptsy. As I created my account, I noticed a spot for a "referral trade key."  First person to give me their key get's it!

@_date: 2013-12-10 20:54:37
I held tightly!  I liked the article, btw.  If I'd done that then I would have had some extra funds to purchase in after it dove.  Good advice.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:48:47
Congrats!  My interest in BTC was first sparked when I stumbled upon r/bitcoin, and now I am the proud owner of 2.  Thanks everyone for a kickass subreddit!  I wouldn't be here without all of you.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:33:34
I do realize the instability of the other cryptocurrencies, however, I am viewing it as a relatively small investment with a small potential for a large upside.  Call it a modest gamble, if you will.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:15:06
Setting up for bitcontips was the easiest thing I have done so far.  Thanks!
