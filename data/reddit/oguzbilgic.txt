What you just said still doesn't make your initial comment correct and my theory invalid.
Something has changed. Most people won't want to deal with BTC directly, instead they will have to use a payment processor.

So far It was optional and mostly used by the small business that didn't want to hold any bitcoins.
But from now on if you don't want to deal with capital gains/losses you have to use a payment processor.
