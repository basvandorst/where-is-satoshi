XAPO cards are just mBank poland prepaid cards [like this one]( You can buy them on allegro.pl for ~$10. For loading they have their own SEPA/SWIFT account number so you can just load them by withdrawing from any exchange.

tbh I don't think ID selfies are going to be very useful either.. too easy to photoshop.. there's lots of source material all it takes is a bit image hacking skills.. once everyone starts asking for these the darknets will gear up to proide them.

localbitcoins is fairly good value really.. right now the price on bitstamp is USD 590.65 which is GBP 352.04. The best offer on localbitcoins is GBP 358 via UKBT - a premium of 1.7% for instant service with free UKBT.
There are now actually quite a few other options.. [coinfloor]( [coincorner]( and [netagio]( as well as [payza]( - but after all the verification and deposit time, trading fees and thin trading volume on these exchanges you may still find it better to use localbitcoins.
You can also trade on [bitstamp]( or [kraken]( and [anxbtc]( fairly easily using SWIFT or SEPA transfers, but those usually incur bank fees that will probably be larger than the localbitcoins markup unless you're doing quite large volumes. One slight benefit with anxbtc is that they can deposit and withdraw GBP - but only via a SWIFT transfer to hong kong so only a slight saving there.. but slightly better than dealing with USD or EUR.
