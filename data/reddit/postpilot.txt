That's exactly how a 14 year old would respond.

Bookmakers like paddy power have the GOP with a slight edge in grabbing the ~~executive branch~~ presidency

Just checked, you're right!

You've clearly taken some with that gif. Let's see how it works out for him

That's actually a pretty decent tip for someone making it rain. 
Nice work

Just the tip

This is what it must feel like to do insider trading on Wall Street. We've won. The venture capital is developing like cats and dogs...and no one knows yet. 
Marginally unrelated, but there are so many new "on-ramps" that have developed since our last bubble namely ATMs everywhere and the pseudo-ETF that came online a few days ago.  Blows my mind how much this is going to turn into a run-away train the next time we start a decent run.

Watched this and thought they'd just found a bunch of dumb dumbs and edited out the knowledgeable answers. 
Turned to my girlfriend and asked her. She said google. Fuckkk

You know how most "old money" is held by worthless people who inherated and don't know jack about hard work etc. 
This is just the opposite. These are the risk takers, the techies and intelligent as fuck. Not only do they deserve it, but they'll likely do great things with their stash. Look at Gates! When smart techies get money and power they do something worthwhile with it.

First time I went in one I was disapointed as fuck because everything is so expensive!

Her shopping and clothes app is a great example of what it takes to actually appeal to women.

Why he would just chill in the US is beyond me. Hell, just find somewhere without an extradition treaty and you're golden. 
[Places that don't extradite]( 
Fair enough, those all look pretty shitty.

On my knees, baby please. Make it rainnnn

I could be satoshi 
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:41:21
Agreed. Honestly I can even try to swing it in Yemen if I truly have to . 
I'll have to remember to cut and run early when I become a shady criminal mastermind. Thanks for the tip
