Ok, let me try and explain this as simply and clearly as possible, so that you can understand.
When something has *intrinsic value,* it is valued for *its own sake.* That means it's not leading to anything good, but is just good in and of itself. This is something like a beautiful painting, or a human being. Things that we don't value just because they can help us get something.
When something has *utilitarian value,* it is valued not because it itself is the good thing we want, but because *it helps you acquire some other good thing.* So we think water is good not because we just enjoy it so much, but because it allows us to live, and living is an intrinsic good. Likewise money, including bitcoins, are *utilitarian goods* because they help us acquire things that we think are good, like beautiful paintings. 
Sometimes a utilitarian good helps you acquire another utilitarian good, like when you use money to buy water. But ultimately a utilitarian good is only good because *it leads to something that is intrinsically good.* Whereas an intrinsic good is simply good because *it itself is good.*
Another example is how *educating yourself about basic philosophical concepts* before you *try and speak condescendingly to people on issues you don't understand* is a utilitarian good, which leads to you *not sounding like a retard on the internet to anyone who actually knows what they're talking about,* which is an intrinsic good.

Well he's right. Water and food don't have intrinsic value, at least not any that we care about. They have utilitarian value; they have value insofar as they serve our purpose. Something with intrinsic value is something that has value even when it serves no purpose, like a person.
Everyone here is quick to laugh at this guy for being an idiot precisely because they have no idea what they're talking about.
