WTF lol. So the US is building it ..... but won't allow anyone from the US to actually use it??? Ya ... that's a slap in the face as an American. Pretty sure I'll just stick with Binance, and Poloneix then. Man, the USA does everything so backwards its not even funny.
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:57:42
not an argument, its pure truth. fiat currency is used every single day for high yield drug trafficking, and money laundering. not much has really changed since the days of escobar. it will ALWAYS exist no matter how much an entity spends money to try and stop it.

Only reason it hasn't replaced anything is because nobody (white house) agrees with it. If it was regulated, I'm sure more and more large scale entities would accept it and adopt. Also .... ever heard of solar panels? lol

I have no idea, I'm just speaking in general. And no, it couldn't be "my" shitcoin because none of these coins are "mine" considering their all intangible. Besides, you never mentioned which "coin" you were speaking of.

Oh, well I've never had an issue with any of my acocunts both at a credit union and a community bank. Been depositing funds from Coinbase into them for about 2 years now with no hassle. Pretty sad to see more and more banks closing people's account especially considering they're able to make money on the money you deposit.
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:31:41
But cant 100% of the population already afford BTC? Even if its only a $5 kids allowance bag, they can still afford it. If the price was one "set in stone" price like fiat, then nobody would trade because there's no possibility of "making more".

"shitcoin" is speculated towards whatever you believe it to be. Hence, its just an opinion (which you are entitled to). Some people might actually have a very good use for said "shitcoin", I mean just because you don't have a use for it, doesn't mean someone else doesn't. Theres a psychology too it, and your basically just tapping into your own emotions by saying that.

Chips and soda (also anonymous) are used as currency for illegal trading and drug sales in prison every single day .... are you proposing we get rid of that too? No matter what the method is, there will ALWAYS be a way for people to "get around" the system. Maybe if government entities quit trying to play "God" on the internet and worry about shit that actually matters in the country, maybe we'd actually have affordable and sustainable health insurance for example.

right dude! be happy for the guy, its probably a big step up from what he had before. plus, buying an expensive car is ridiculious anyway, then you have a high monthly insurance, and repairs will be hella expensive. just sounds like a big money pit to me, buying an expensive ride just cause bitcoin made you a bunch of money.

Or you just dont pay taxes on it at all. Its not like the US actually has people to enforce it lol. Im not from the US by the way.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:57:45
That's why you just cash out 1 BTC at a time, here and there. Man, US gov't always gotta stick their noses in everything. It's pretty sad amd seeing how they react to crypto only proves they only care about $! They could give 2 shits about the people lol. If they cared about the people, then healthcare wouldn't be a clusterfuck in the USA. Plain and simple. Because healthcare is and always will be more important than fucking digital currencies lol.

Ya, you kids and your daily "lunch money" ruin this market lol.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:35:04
If the USA wants citizens to pay taxes on cryptocurrencies, then they should be responsible for providing their citizens with a standard way of calculating this shit. Plain and simple.

@_date: 2018-04-16 21:54:04
There's no room in prisons dude. You clearly didnt even read my comment.It costs the governemnt over $50k per year to incarcerate 1 prisoner. With a failing economy, this will not happen. They'd have to literally find us and steal from us individually to get their money, and we all know that aint happening.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:36:02

Your title is misleading and makes people think shit thats not true. Sorry to bust your bubble but a multi billion dollar company (Coinbase) follows all rules and regulstions set forth by the US Government. They will not sell your freaking information dude, that would be highly illegal and that's not the kind of risk a multi billion dollar company would take. Please have some common sense.

In reality, nothing has value, other than the "value" that we as humans put on it. Think about a headlamp on a vehicle. The 1 and only reason it has any "value" is because someone says it does. Which by that means, is just speculation.

Get the fuck outta here and learn how the internet works. I could just as easily get the kids personal info, anybody could. Its the fucking internet kid, grow up and realize your not the only one using it. Probably sitting here with your little anti virus software thinking your "safe" and shit lol.

lol you act like prisons and county jails actually have room for tax evaders. Ive worked as a guard in 2 different priosns. Trust me, there's no room here for tax evaders. Prisons are already overloaded and at full capacity for actual people comitting actual crimes like murder/drug trafficking/and rape. People like you make me laugh, so damn scared of the governmemt.
