I never used MtGox and won't use them no matter how secure they are. It's just dumb to trust anyone with your money in this type of market. I trust myself and that's about it.

I did too, but I got the hint in the first few attacks. I changed all my passwords to be something unique for each one and something so complex I have to look them up every time I log in. Sucks but with a world full of free loaders, its got to be done

I bet its for gaming or something.

Lol crazy shit, funny I just woke up to see it happen.

They must have some good GPU's on their computers. I used to work at a tv station and know for a fact none of their computers are rockin the vid cards unless it's for doing the small of graphics rendering that are needed for tv. People need to learn fast that CPU mining is worthless, even if it's free, it's not worth your job or the time.

Wow I didn't expect such faithless comments in the article. They pretty much sum up the idea of, don't try anything new because that's done no one any good. Dumb ass people use shit every day that people thought was worthless when in development.

Don't brag it's not good for your ego

I would print something but it's smaller. Do you have a site and costs yet?
@_date: 2011-07-24 22:17:45
Fraggle, dude I'm sorry for the no feedback. I have been moving and will for sure once I get to my new place. It's a move from the west coast to east, so just a few more days. Bitharbor works, is awesome, and I'll use it again. Just for me I marked down my prices because it's bitcoin and I respect people who use it enough to give them a break and make a few bitcoins in the process. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:38:54
I agree that mining has become a past time. It's too hard for profits to be made for the small guys and with the nexts weeks price drops it's going to be even worse. GET OUT before it's too late. Trust me, I'm an mining addict. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 23:21:36
who cares how influential they are. Doesn't mean they know what they are talking about. I watched like 5 min of the video before I understood how little the woman knew but just wanted to get rich off the bubble like every other wanker who reads about bitcoins. Hes mining but gave up because he didn't make anything but his friend made 50 bitcoin...?
@_date: 2011-06-27 06:09:44
No not really. 
@_date: 2011-07-08 02:13:17
That was annoying as hell
@_date: 2011-06-30 03:20:25
I highly disbeleive that the govrenment has the resources for the computing power needed to take over bitcoin. Maybe CPU power but not GPU. 
@_date: 2011-06-21 05:25:00
and this is why all these people are going to be dumping their coins, because they don't know what they have. Should be fun buying it up for really cheap for some of us.
@_date: 2011-06-19 09:08:58
awesome to see your store. I don't smoke but I still looked at your site. 
@_date: 2011-07-11 22:20:57
I use it because I am sick of my country being raped by banks and don't believe in the current federal type system. I wouldn't use it if my country still allowed the people to speak and be heard and if they would rightfully give the power the stated have back to them. Until then I think it's a shit storm just waiting to happen, and bitcoin or something like that will give peoe some power once again.
@_date: 2011-06-23 14:54:55
This reminds me of the movie it's a wonderful life, but without the guy who has a heart and gives the money back to the people. We all know that the movies are fake right?... Right?
@_date: 2011-06-21 01:45:29
more like a bit dime 
@_date: 2011-06-15 21:48:02
I highly doubt that other countries will get into mining. What we don't understand is that GPU cost in other countries are much higher then in the states. I have already tried to build machines in china and the cost effectiveness is none existent. I don't know about other places besides china but the cost of the cards there don't cover the cost of the computer.

buy buy buy!

I just have one question for this guy. Does he have a sleeping/drug problem? His eyes look like hes been tweeking for a while. 
@_date: 2011-07-15 02:23:54
@_date: 2011-07-06 03:08:46
The reason I said you were dumb is because you attcked bitcoin security not the traders. My words still stand, and you freaking out just made it that much better.
@_date: 2011-06-21 05:29:45
I think they were drunk. I talk like that all the time, and I am always wasted. 
@_date: 2011-07-21 07:22:39
It's the media. We all know it's fake anyways. Now if the daily show said somethig like this then we should be worried.
@_date: 2011-07-09 04:21:03
Ohhh pretty. I like it!
@_date: 2011-08-24 06:20:28
Wrong area to post. Try bitmarket subreddit. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 01:23:50
So everyone should sell because you failed? Lots of people lost money here and lots made money, you don't seem them coming on here and saying it's the end of all that's bitcoin. Chill the hell out lol
@_date: 2011-06-19 17:57:51
I think it's a bug, my coin app is all over the place
@_date: 2011-06-29 04:30:01
You sir are dumb as shit. If you know anything about bitcoin security then you wouldn't talk about Mt. Gox and how they got hacked and shit, while referring to bitcoin. Thats like saying, well a number of banks went under so the USD must not have very good security because  its easy to have a USD and then your bank goes under. Its people like you that make bitcoin even more worth while.
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:43:35
Unless you register every domain by a fake address and name...
@_date: 2011-08-25 03:00:20
They aren't going to flaunt the good things about bitcoin based on the fact that it would seem they supported the idea of having a different currency. The fact that bitcoin is p2p causes a bit of a problem to shutting it down, now, or in 10 years. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 21:23:34
Lets watch a retarded movie about people that have no idea what they are talking about. YAY
@_date: 2011-06-23 14:52:06
I can agree with a lot of what you said. Another thing that bitcoin has going for it is that we have the option of making the market for it. It's controlled (so far) by the very people who use it, rather than the government or someone pretending to be the government (federal reserve). Bitcoin is a little power over our hard earned cash and we have the right to keep our money, to not pay high taxes for the horrible spending practices of our so called leaders and banks who have taken our trust for granted. Really bitcoin is a movement not a currency, and we say it's our money bitches. 
@_date: 2011-07-09 04:20:16
As the last post I saw said, "probably." I'm drunk forgive me so
@_date: 2011-07-13 18:43:46
Well if you do currency trading you would see it change every few moments. The trend does look like it's a take over and going up. 
@_date: 2011-06-16 01:43:04
Do you really think the government is going to be all happy that there is a new currency out there that gives people their own freedom? If anything it will just piss them off that someones not using the USD or transforming the USD into something else. I see bitcoin pissing a lot of people off and really that's what makes it good. If your not pissing a lot of rich people off who have raped the world for everything its worth, then your not doing much good.
@_date: 2011-06-11 21:04:17
I think if it was made illegal it would jump in use at least on the Internet. Many people don't know about bitcoin and well if the government does official actions twords making it illegal, then more people think it's cool to use it. Drugs are the same way along with many other things. Sure it would make actions to make it a common currency in the US but it doesn't mean people give a shit. My personal opinion anyways
