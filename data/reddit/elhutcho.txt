Excerpt from the link above: The normal case without pathologically large/giant fee Segwit transactions results in a block size of around 2MB, which is what the creators of Segwit designed for. When you hear someone say “Segwit is a block size increase”, this is what they’re referring to. The average Segwit block size will be roughly 2MB, though Legacy nodes will still receive blocks that are 1,000,000 bytes or lower due to stripped witness data.
I guess we're not seeing bigger blocks yet because people aren't sending Segwit transactions, but I might be wrong.

I'm using xbt.eu and blockchain.info. I didn't realise it would be necessary to use a different block explorer - can you recommend one? Thanks!

 is a good comparison site for the UK. I've had a good experience using Coinfloor, but you have to deposit at least £1k.

Are you sure the fee is 0.005? coinsbank.com/fees says withdrawals from ฿0.0001, fee 0.5%, min ฿0.005, max ฿1. I interpret that to mean that the minimum withdrawal amount is 0.005, not the minimum fee. If you've got 50 USD of BTC on their site, I assume you've got around 0.012 BTC, so I would have thought the fee would be 0.0001 (as 0.5% of 0.012 is 0.00006, which is lower than the 0.0001 minimum withdrawal fee). Make sense?
