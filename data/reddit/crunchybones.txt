Multitouch turned Apple from a billion dollar company into almost a trillion dollar company.  Lightning and layer two apps will do the same for Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:08:18
Yup, because software never can be updated.

People are still saying it’s going to $100,000.00 USD and it’s half the price it was at $19k.  If anything, the target should be higher than $100k with recent developments with layer two apps starting to hit the public.

What you perceive as taking a long time, I perceive as being conservative and thought out.   If you don’t like BTC then don’t buy or own it.  No one is forcing you too.  You are going on and on about how horrible BTC is in a BTC community.  Comparing BTC to a Microsoft product is asinine.  You can continue to argue with me all you want and you can continue to “what about” all you want but BTC is the �� of crypto and it will be for the foreseeable future imo.  
For the last time, good day.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:30:07
This is strictly price manipulation by Wall Street.  They have huge positions and plenty of cash.  They want your BTC and they know how to get it.   The tech behind BTC is solid and getting stronger every day.  This will be known as the great BTC shakedown of 2018.   Book it.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:50
Yeah, and bitcoin can and will do all of that and more.   
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:45:32
The price didn’t just go from $1000.00 to $20,000.00 over night.   How many sell offs were there in that time?  More bots?   Nothing happened in the space either, right?  No hard forks? No soft forks?  No developments?  
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:35:02
I think it’s great.    Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:14:58

You made the argument that the fees were too high to open a lightning channel.  The reason bitcoin fees are high is because people are actually using the network.  Your defense is well we have these other coins that don’t have high fees.  They don’t have high fees because no one is using the network.  I have to his great highway it’s super fast but it goes nowhere.   Show me a coin with more transactions then bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:52:19
My wife told me a story yesterday that a colleague from work told her he just bought some bitcoin.  She said that’s great what did you pay for it? He said around $2500.00 USD.  She told him, sorry that’s not Bitcoin, you just bought bcash.   I was so proud that she knew the difference.   
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:34:51
Please show me where these other coins have any value besides on an exchange?  Please show me a coin with the same amount of transactions per block as Bitcoin?

@_date: 2018-01-17 21:16:44
That’s great, and how many of those transactions have to deal with virtual cats?   My point is that yes lightning is open source but it is only useful if there are people actually using the coin.  ETH is not in competition with bitcoin, eth is IMO a companion to BTC.  
It’s been fun, enjoy! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:47:03
Absolutely, just my opinion.  But I’ve been here for a long time and I’ve seen this countless times.  The only difference is the swings and volatility are on a larger scale.

If you held BTC before any of the hard forks, can you still move your coins to another wallet and still get to keep the forked coins or do you have to separate them first before moving your original BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:36:36
Ok, so your bitcoins are your bitcoins they don’t get mixed up and then the value gets put in your new wallet.  They are yours until you send them to someone else’s wallet.

Look at the six hour and daily chart on GDAX.  Just my opinion, if you believe in TA then you’ll see what I am talking about.   
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:29:47
That’s total bullshit.  Bitcoin is not printing millions of coins like OTC stock companies do with shares on the OTC market.  Next.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:41:01
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:16:03
Its understanding candle sticks, simple moving average, and patterns.  Some will tell you that TA is a bunch of nonsense.  It really is a self fulfilling prophecy because the SMAs move to where the price was.  But understanding candles, support and resistance on a chart can help make sense of the general market sentiment.   Some will tell you bitcoin trades way too fast for TA to have any meaning.  I tend to agree that the 1, 5, and 15 minute chart are sometimes very useless with BTC. I like  looking at the hour, six hour and daily chart.  
When I made my first comment on this, BTC broke through a key resistance on the six hour chart and on the daily chart too.  IMO I expect the price to bounce around the upper $9,000 region for a few days before we see a move either higher or lower.   
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:43:14

This has to rank as one of the weirdest and yet most compelling financial topics I’ve ever encountered.
It involves the digital currency called Bitcoin. And my guess is that many readers of this screed have never heard of it.
Understanding the Bitcoin phenomenon may tax your brain, as it did mine, because it pushes the limits of our concept of currencies.
But Bitcoin is gaining in popularity as more online merchants begin accepting it. Some background:
About five years ago, a mysterious computer programming genius supposedly named Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym, most likely) created a new digital currency called Bitcoin.
I say “supposedly” because even today, no one knows for sure where Nakamoto lives or if he even exists. I say “digital” because this currency is not backed by gold, silver or government; rather, it exists online.
It’s even possible the Bitcoin creator is more than one person. A writer for The New Yorker magazine tried to find Nakamoto a couple of years ago but failed.
Anyway, as the story goes, Nakamoto had grown skeptical of traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar, yen and other so-called fiat currencies after the 2008 financial crisis. He believed central banks were undercutting the value of these currencies by printing too much of them.
So Nakamoto decided to develop a currency devoid of governmental or political influence.
He wrote 31,000 lines of computer code that essentially created Bitcoin, according to The New Yorker. Through this computer program, he set a limit on the amount of Bitcoin that would eventually be available in the system.
Only 21 million Bitcoins will be created over the next 20 years, and currently about 10 million are in virtual circulation. By that, I mean they are held in Bitcoin “wallets” inside computers all over the world.
Price volatility
Currently, it takes about $106 to buy one Bitcoin, but the price movement is highly volatile. It has been as high as $220 earlier this year, and as low as $20 a couple of years ago. One of the best explanations of this craze came from a webcast interview with Brian Armstrong, co-founder of Coinbase Inc., one of the more respectable Bitcoin trading platforms or exchanges.
Small investors can buy and sell Bitcoin on these exchanges. They have to register with Coinbase or Mt.Gox, another popular exchange, to get the process started.
I requested an interview with Armstrong, but so far, no luck with that, although the company did respond to my email.
The best way to conceptualize Bitcoin is to think of it as virtual gold. Just as investors use dollars to buy gold, they can use dollars to buy Bitcoin and then purchase stuff — video games, books and computers — anything really.
An increasing number of online retailers accept Bitcoin as payment, and even the hotel chain Howard Johnson will accept Bitcoin. I found an interesting Wall Street Journal blog post that said 300 merchants have registered with Coinbase, including Reddit and OKCupid.com, a dating site.
The growing acceptance of Bitcoin by merchants is one of the reasons the value of the currency has skyrocketed since its creation. (By the way, the buzz around Bitcoin is that several early investors have become Bitcoin millionaires.)
It probably should come as no surprise that as the potential for hefty profits has increased, so have the chances of getting ripped off.
Local Ponzi scheme
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently filed a complaint against a McKinney man, Trendon T. Shavers, who allegedly defrauded investors in a Ponzi scheme involving Bitcoin. Regulators said that Shavers, founder of Bitcoin Savings and Trust, promised investors up to 7 percent in weekly interest.
The problem was he allegedly used Bitcoin from new investors to make purported interest payments to old investors, according to the SEC.
The lesson for those who want to dabble in Bitcoin is to be sure to trade with reputable Bitcoin dealers. The SEC recently issued an investor alert warning about the dangers of Bitcoin investment scams.
I’m fascinated to see whether this mysterious online currency evolves into a mainstream medium of exchange. On one hand, I like the idea of an online currency devoid of government intrusion and manipulation. But on the other hand, it is unsettling to think that a handful of computer geeks — probably sitting with their laptops in garages in California — wrote the algorithms that control the flow of Bitcoin.
Personally, I doubt that Bitcoin ever becomes a widely accepted currency, if for no other reason than its price fluctuates too much. It’s more likely that investors will continue to own Bitcoin as they do gold simply as an investment — an investment in digits.

Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox reveals technical upgrades to boost performance
by David Meyer  2 HOURS AGO 1 Comment
A A
Mt.Gox, which is still the biggest Bitcoin exchange by trading volume, is now self-hosting and using Akamai’s content delivery network — but lengthy deposit and withdrawal times remain a problem.
tweet this
When it comes to buying and selling bitcoins, Tokyo-based Mt.Gox is still the biggest player. Even though it may have contributed to to April’s great Bitcoin crash, and other exchanges such as Bitstamp may be snapping at its heels, more than half of all trades by volume still take place through Mt.Gox – so it comes as good news for the burgeoning crypto-currency that the service is working hard to make itself more stable and reliable.
In a blog post on Monday, the Mt.Gox team said the service had moved from being externally hosted to being self-hosted, a shift that will apparently allow greater flexibility and control. It is also now using Akamai’s content delivery network to boost performance for users around the world.
Mt.Gox said it will also soon launch a new trading engine called Midas that is capable of running “much more” than 500,000 trades per second, as well as a new user interface design. Once all these pieces are in place, the team added, Mt.Gox will be able to support the Bitcoin rival Litecoin.
However, one of the biggest problems with Mt.Gox doesn’t look set to be fixed anytime soon, and that’s the time it takes to make deposits and withdrawals. Here the team wrote:
“It currently takes up to 10 days to process a deposit because our bank, upon receiving deposits, notifies us of the deposit but holds them for 7-10 days before transferring them to our account. This has always been the case, and we were still crediting customer accounts before receiving the funds ourselves, but some cases in which the bank subsequently rejected the deposits meant that we incurred significant losses.
“The risk is now too high for us to credit accounts prematurely. We are in the process of forming relationships with new partners, banks, and taking other steps — hopefully we will not only be back where we were before we encountered these issues, but much further ahead.”
tweet this
This is crucial stuff. If Mt.Gox and other players in the Bitcoin ecosystem want to see the virtual currency gain wider traction, they will have to offer a service that can operate as closely as possible to standard-currency timescales.
That slow trading time is partly an issue of the liquidity of the exchange itself, and partly a matter of user verification – a touchy subject for many Bitcoin enthusiasts, who prize the relative anonymity of the currency’s use. Last month the Union Square Ventures-backed Coinbase offered instant Bitcoin purchases and sales to those willing to submit to a heavy ID check, as an anti-money-laundering measure (it usually takes 4 working days). Technical updates are only part of the picture when it comes to offering a smooth Bitcoin user experience.

WHITE HOUSE POWWOW TODAY WITH FINANCIAL REGULATORS — President Barack Obama will spend his first day back from summer vacation meeting with financial regulators — all of them! — at the White House this afternoon. The group will “discuss the progress that has been made in strengthening the financial system, including the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,” the White House said.
On the invite list: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, Comptroller Thomas Curry, FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White, Acting Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Ed DeMarco and National Credit Union Administration Chairman Debbie Matz. The meeting is closed press.
FIRST LOOK: BITCOIN POLICY PRIMER FROM MERCATUS -- As Washington gets to know Bitcoin better, the Mercatus Center at George Mason University is releasing a “primer” for policymakers Tuesday. Mercatus senior research fellow Jerry Brito and program associate Andrea Castillo warn that applying existing rules to the digital “cryptocurrency” could impede its development. Bitcoin doesn’t fit into any existing regulatory category – it’s not a foreign currency, traditional commodity or a payments network – and they said policymakers may want to consider a new regulatory category.
They also urged policymakers not to “overreact” to illicit uses of Bitcoin and said regulators need to consider the criminal uses alongside its legitimate uses. In addition, they said lawmakers and regulators should consider whether it’s necessary to preempt state-by-state licensing for Bitcoin businesses — what they call one of the technology’s “greatest obstacles.” The full report:

Having BitPay embedded into 3dcart makes it very easy for merchants to setup a webstore and start accepting bitcoin payments without writing any code.
Tamarac, FL (PRWEB) August 05, 2013
3dcart, an increasingly popular ecommerce platform with more than 16,000 global merchants, announced today that it has partnered with BitPay, an electronic payment service provider that gives online store owners the ability to accept Bitcoins as payment for goods and services.
Bitcoin is a new financial technology that was invented in 2009 as the first peer-to-peer digital currency. Using Bitcoins, it is possible to send money -- to anyone, anytime, anywhere -- without going through a bank, government or corporate entity.
“Bitcoins are quickly becoming a popular form of payment online and BitPay simplifies it for internet retailers that want to offer it as a payment alternative, without the need of a deep understanding on Bitcoins,” said Jimmy Rodriguez, CTO for 3dcart. “The built-in BitPay integration is one of the flag features of the new 3dcart 6.0 version.”
The new partnership grants BitPay instant access to 16,000+ global merchants by making the bitcoin payment solution a native feature inside 3dcart’s robust shopping cart platform. Now, 3dcart merchants will be able to install and configure BitPay directly from their 3dcart Store Managers without having to download third-party software.
“Having BitPay embedded into 3dcart makes it very easy for merchants to setup a webstore and start accepting Bitcoin payments without writing any code,” said Tony Gallippi, co-founder and CEO of BitPay.
There is no setup or monthly subscription fee to use BitPay. Each Bitcoin transaction costs 0.99% of the total purchasing price, making it an affordable solution for every 3dcart store owner.
