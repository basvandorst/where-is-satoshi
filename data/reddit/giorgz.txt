Except, because you have a high volume of transactions at that point (due to low fees &amp; fast transactions that LN offers), the volatility is lowered. The higher the adoption, the lower the volatility.

Lightning will help bring more privacy, not sure if it will be enough for fungibility though.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:19:48
Main difference:
1. BTC = Believe the solution to scaling (lower fees / faster transactions) is Lightning Network.
2. BCH = Believe the solution to scaling is to increase block size. The trouble is that this requires an increase in write speeds and rate of increasing storage capacity for miners. They claim this is sustainable because of the assumption that Moore's Law will continue. However, the person who observed Moore's Law in the first place, himself claims that Moore's Law will stop around 2022. Therefore, making BCH's solution to scaling unsustainable in the long term.
1. The majority of node/miners voted *against* increasing the block size. This is what true democracy looks like (majority of votes wins). For the group that *support* increasing the block size, BCH was born (the minority get to have what *they* want - it's a win/win!).
2. Bitcoin is the most known cryptocurrency while all others are "altcoins". Therefore, if any crypto can somehow steal the "Bitcoin" brand name away from BTC for themselves, their value will soar (while BTC will drop).
3. As a result, naturally, BCH is incentivised to do whatever they can (including spreading misinformation) to steal the "Bitcoin" brand name. Personally, I see such an attempt is an attack on democracy (due to an attempt to overrule majority vote). They already control the sub-reddit "btc" (yet their name is "bch") and they are in charge of "bitcoin.com". My belief is that BCH supporters are like Bitconnect supporters; unaware until it's too late.
For more information (so you don't take my word for it), investigate yourself by asking both BTC &amp; BCH supporters of their thoughts.

You have a fair criticism. Ultimately, we're a community that's trying to help one another because we fundamentally believe in the same thing (even if we disagree on a bunch of details). Because of this, we tend to be more trusting of one another, rather than question *every* tiny detail. So my impression is that we're here to help one another and that there was a better way for that to happen. But as you have pointed out, this opinion of mine can be flawed, just as much as anyone else's opinion.

The fact that a bank is an exchange is a good thing. Why?
1. Bank won’t shut down your account when you send money to an exchange.
2. Exchanges are generally unregulated. Banks are regulated.
3. Banks can scale, instead of slowing down or suspending new registrations.
4. Banks already have the majority of customers, making it easier for newbies to join without jumping through hoops to get started. As newbies advance their understanding, they will likely move their crypto away from banks.
Just because you exchanged your fiat for crypto at a bank does not make crypto centralised. What would make it centralised is if everyone kept their money on the exchange, which is what we should educate people about not doing.
In some countries, the banks don’t let businesses that accept crypto payments operate a bank account for their business. This wouldn’t happen in Japan as a result of bank exchanges (I hope?).
What I’m saying is, you’re right, ultimately it’s not where we want to be - I believe that it’s a step forward.

I agreed with most things, and disagree about LocalBitcoin.
The issue (especially for newbies) is that it’s easy to get scammed on LocalBitcoin, have your bank find out about it and exit you. This happened to me when I was a newbie. Really discouraging to continue with crypto when your own bank tells you that you not only lost a bunch of money, but they aren’t re-embursing you (unlike in other scams) and that they are going to report you to the police (even though you are the victim). In the end, I got really lucky, in a way that most people won’t, which allowed them to simply only exit me.
Furthermore, at LocalBitcoin, if the person selling you BTC is doing KYC, they are more likely to get your ID documents stolen by a third party / hacker etc, than an exchange, because they may not have no security system set up for holding customer details. You have no idea what they do with your personal information, they may be saving it for later to use for fraud.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:26:08
Yeah, I know :/
The other issue is that, those people who use their credit card as debt/borrowing for buying crypto, are often not highly financially literate. So the additional fees won’t deter them much, but will simply end up costing them even more.

When it comes to Kim Dotcom, I feel like I’m missing something. To me, he is a glorified criminal.
For now, I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe I’m missing something. Much like how banks might say “Bitcoin is used for illegal activities” which (to anyone uninformed) covers up the problems with that argument.
So what am I missing from the Kim Dotcom scenario that I should make myself aware of?

Although that’s partially true, it’s not the complete truth. You &amp; I could set up a media company and build it up to be quite powerful. No-one would tell us what to post about, although some may offer to pay us if we reported what they wanted us to report (but this is a democracy, we can refuse, unless we sell our company).
However, the other huge influence is what gets the media lots of views/traffic. It’s spreading emotionally charged news. The more extreme the point of view I present and the more controversial it is, the more emotionally people will respond. As a result, the more people pay attention. Which results in more advertising revenue.
It’s all about what sells, which is sadly often whatever triggers strong negative emotions.

Lots of gamers are complaining that GPUs are now expensive because of crypto mining. What do you think will happen to storage costs when there’s a huge demand on storage due to adoption? Storage costs decrease over time, but not fast enough and not when the demand has sky rocketed due to a completely new industry. Why go down that expensive route when you have LN as a viable more affordable option?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:45:17
The trouble: We want to eventually turn into a world where the majority use cryptocurrencies instead of fiat. So “not telling anyone” is only a temporary solution until adoption grows.
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:34:21
1. Because Moore’s Law is a theory.
2. Because the storage demand will increase faster than Moore’s Law can keep up.
3. Because transaction confirmation speed demand will increase faster than disk write speed.
Because ‘untested’ is an invalid argument when your own BCH future is also based on predictions that does not offer any guarantees (your predictions being: Moore’s Law will continue in general, and Moore’s Law will keep up with storage &amp; write speed demand).

You’ve been fortunate. Although the rating system helps, like an exchange that may get hacked, so could the account of a heavy user. Also, just cause they have a high rating, doesn’t mean anything about the storage of use of your ID documents (as a user has no way of knowing about that - that rating is only about trades made).

I think you missed my point. I was criticising NEM on its own merits, not defending Bitcoin. This conversation is not NEM vs Bitcoin. This conversation is “Is NEM fungible?”, my conclusion is “No”. You come back with “Neither is Bitcoin”, and I say “Yes, but that doesn’t suddenly make NEM fungible”. If I were to use a crypto as an alternative to discuss fungibility, it would be Monero, due to the high level of privacy (not Bitcoin - yet).
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:12:58
I like to learn too, but like to leave a discussion if I find that it’s not going anywhere beneficial anymore.
We wouldn’t reach a conclusion because, no matter what their profit is, they already take a cut whenever a transaction is made. The fact that they are adding an *additional* charge for no reason, I disagree with. If they truly aren’t making much money, then they should increase costs of every purchase, not specifically crypto.
We can to agree to disagree.

Fair enough, thanks for the explanation :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:11:50
Before making a decision, ask yourself:
1. How much do you understand about Bitcoin?
2. Why did you buy Bitcoin?
If your answer to Q1 is limited and your answer to Q2 is "to make money" or "because someone told me to", then I would strongly suggest doing a large amount of independent research before making a decision. If you panic sell, then do much more research before investing in anything again, so that you know what you're getting yourself into.
If your answer to Q1 is "I know quite a lot, I'm just scared about losing money" and Q2 is "because I support the idea of equality and economic inclusion for those living in 3rd world countries" then you're not far off from finding the answer to your original question by doing a little bit more research regarding previous Bitcoin crashes. The questions to ask yourself at this point become: How long will it be before I need to use the money I have in Bitcoin? Can I afford to lose any of it?
Some topics for further research:

@_date: 2018-01-28 21:01:25
I see what you’re saying, but a person can get a loan for crypto and buy via different method. I see credit card as a payment method, not as borrowing money (as many people pay it off without paying interest).
The trouble with debit card is that, overall the fee is higher, since no rewards are earned using a debit card (but a credit card can earn back up to 1.3% of spending or even more, depending on the credit card) while the exchange charges the same fee whether a credit or debit card is used.
Finally, why not a wire transfer? Because many of us live internationally to most exchanges. So payments to exchanges from our bank does a few things:
1. Delays the payment confirmation by several days if not 1-2 weeks (meaning you miss the exact time you want to make a purchase)
2. Delays the payment confirmation by several days if not 1-2 weeks (meaning your money is on the exchange longer - “not your keys”)
3. Your bank flags a international payment, calls you to ask you about it. If you say ‘crypto’ (or they notice the merchant is a crypto exchange), you risk getting exited (large credit card payments get flagged a lot less often than large international payments).

Excellent points. I would like to add that although you have constant inflation, it is not guaranteed. Just like there is risk of a cryptocurrency crashing, you have a risk in a fiat system crashing. As happened in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Greece etc. So the lesson is to diversify your assets/investments.
As technology and adoption grows, so will the transaction speed, price stability and transaction affordability for the crypto. Daily trade volume for Bitcoin is less than $5 million USD equivalent, while USD is in the trillions.
I'm not saying to go with Bitcoin. I'm just saying that each currency type has it's pros and cons.

Ok, good points (especially my typo). But let’s put it into perspective instead of speculating. I’ve Google to discover that:
In 2015, Visa &amp; MasterCard took a combined revenue of $22 billion. MasterCard’s margin was 84.71% that year and Visa’s margin was 72.64%. That’s still a combined profit of over $15 billion.

At the end of he day, I don’t think we’ll reach a conclusion no matter what we say to each other. I don’t think they should charge us extra “for the privilege” but you think that it’s ok that they do. I don’t think our conversation will affect their decision either.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:23:55
Is it? You rebuttal addresses only one of the two points I made. But ok, I'll bite.
Type into Google "Proof of Moore's Law", and you will find that:
1. "Moore's law refers to an **observation** made by Intel co-founder **Gordon Moore** in 1965." and is "**not a physical or natural law**."
2. "Although the rate held steady from 1975 until around 2012, the rate was faster during the first decade." and "in 2015 **Gordon Moore** foresaw that the rate of progress would reach saturation".
I.e. Moore's Law is an observation of the trend at the time, not something that was proven to continue into the future. And **the guy who made the original observation, now observes that it's slowing down**. If you Google further, we can see a consensus that Moore's Law is likely coming to an **end in the next few years**:
1. "Intel's former chief architect Bob Colwell recently said that Moore's law will be dead within a decade. Colwell predicted that the maximum extension of the law, in which transistor densities continue doubling every 18-24 months, will be hit in 2020 or 2022, around 7nm or 5nm."

Your criticism, although valid did this: “It’s not true, because it can also be done with this other thing”.

You said USD and EUR, convenient that you didn’t mention currencies from countries like Zimbabwae and Venezuela.
This is where the use-case is same as fiat (I.e. buy food etc). Not to mention that USD/EUR cash is still used to buy drugs anyway. Not like you’re stopping it from happening.
For countries like Zimbabwae and Venezuela, the store-of-value in Bitcoin is better than government currency. Although Bitcoin is volatile (for now) due to limited adaption, but it’s not susceptible to hyperinflation (unlike government currency). Volatility will die as adoption grows (considering daily trade volume for USD is literally over two hundred times more than Bitcoin right now).
Therefore, if you adopt Bitcoin (or a different crypto currency), you‘re helping those that otherwise suffer from hyperinflation due to their government &amp; banking system fucking up. You are supporting them because adoption reduces volatility, and creating a demand for the first world countries to change their financial system.
So before you judge Bitcoin and it’s users so short-sightedly, think about what Bitcoin is trying to support and which side of that battle you’re on.

My interpretation is: they will charge you a fee, then exit you anyway.
They already make a ton of money per purchase transaction. Why do you think they can afford to give rewards on credit cards? Interest charges are not the only way they make money. They charge the merchant a fee every time you use that card (whether it be with Coinbase or the grocery store)
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:40:15
Visa/MasterCard have tokens..? I still wouldn’t invest in them based on the principal of what they do vs the reason people want crypto as a currency.
Anyway, looks like Google search says they charge an average of 1.5% per transaction. If one person buys 1 BTC, that’s still $150 just for that. There’a more than one person buying BTC using their credit card though...
EDIT: $1500 typo.

It’s because you continued your justification for demonising a person, which is not relevant to my point. My point was: there’s no value to demonising a person.

Yes, no idea who he is. Why argue? I’m not arguing about him, I’m arguing about an idea.
Why? Because I believe very much in the idea of demonising ideas / beliefs / behaviours rather than people and want to promote this idea.
Why? Because I believe it to be one of the reasons our world is falling apart these days. I believe it to be what creates extremism in the world. Where tolerance for other people that disagree with us is small.
In a oversimplified way: The moment you point a finger at someone to tell them they’re a terrible person, is the moment the shut down from hearing why (and become worse / more extreme). But if you tell them that their actions were terrible but you can understand why they did what they did, is the moment they listen and try to change.

You can learn about it and shares ideas about it with people. Show your support for it. People will naturally resist it. Don't get into the debates.

r/wallstreetbets just has a toxic community altogether. People don’t collaborate and support each other there, they openly shit on one another.
For example, a newbie points in bitcoin ”someone that had bitcoins passed away, wtf do I do?” and everyone immediately begins with “don’t share your private keys”. Maybe one person will try to scam the newb.
Over in that gambling place of a subreddit, they would do an equivalent of “tell me your private keys and I’ll help you out” (scam them). While maybe one person will try to help the newb.
@_date: 2019-08-27 00:23:09
Agreed. But my point still stands. Why? Because eventually (like it happens with the banks), there will come a time where an exchange collapses because it's got too much 'fake' Bitcoin. However, the exchange cannot be 'bailed out' (unlike banks) because Bitcoin cannot be printed (unlike fiat).
The people that used that exchange will have learned the lesson the hard way (by losing their Bitcoin), and everyone else will have what they already know re-confirmed (to not leave their money on an exchange). Slowly more people will move away from exchanged.
In short, using Bitcoin instead of fiat (even on an exchange) is still a step forward. The part where exchanges are no-longer used is just another eventual step away.

Not necessarily. The 3rd party is only there to mediate the escrow. They are not able to do anything else. So yes, it's less decentralisation, however, you still get several benefits over the current system. For example, the government cannot print money (inflationary), which is one of the biggest advantages (i.e. prevents crashes like 2008 or hyperinflation etc). Plus, there would be no KYC requirement with the 3rd party unless a dispute is initiated via the escrow service.

You have a good point. But we can't predict what the future, because we are shifting from currencies that are used based on country (fiat), to currencies that are used based on use-case (crypto). Each person may have multiple use-cases by that point. We can't know for sure.

Trouble with your logic: It assumes that BTC will be the only currency. But, for all we know, there could be 20 major crypto-currencies by the time most fiat currencies are phased out. As in, people could have their wealth distributed amount several currencies, not just one.

I will answer a few question the other person didn’t.
1. Censorship resistance means (if I understand it correctly) that if I am the government or bank and I don’t like what you’re doing but cannot legally stop it, I can stop allowing you to transact. A bank is a private company and therefore has no obligation to allow you to use their services (it can choose to discriminate however it wants). This level of power is worrying. This is what PayPal and Paetreon have been in the media about recently (although they may have been reasonable, they have entered a slippery slope). However, some crypto (like Bitcoin) is decentralised, one entity can not control it and nor can it stop a transaction from happening.
2. Does one currency to rule them all concern me?
Yes and no. Yes, it would if that were the case, but no, im not worried, because it (hopefully) wouldn’t be the case. You would move from country-based fiat currencies to various crypto currencies I.e. you would have Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Cardano etc etc all existing simultaneously. People get even more freedom to choose which of the currencies they want to use, as some may be better for certain types of transactions than others.

Exchanges and crypto *should* be regulated by government. Not in all aspects (I.e. I agree about anti-money laundering acts being a risk to security/privacy and not actually achieving much). “Why?” You ask. Because of things like insider trading at exchanges and pump-and-dumps are legal in crypto (while illegal in the stock market).

Indeed, weigh up the risk. You’re trying to sell your crypto in the very short term, you’re not holding long-term on an exchange. The keys rule doesn’t quite apply in this scenario.

That’s unfair. Taxes require being paid to run a country. If some people avoid taxes, means another part of the population have to pay taxes instead. Maybe we need taxes to be reformed, but making it entirely voluntary sends the government into anarchy.

Keeping your money on an exchange destroys the whole purpose of owning Bitcoin in the first place. You’re trusting someone else with your money.
Ask yourself, why are you in Bitcoin in the first place? Educate yourself by watching some Andreas videos or read his books.
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:26:51
I think you picked apart my literal words rather than trying to understand what I meant. How about I put I in a simpler form: Right now, it’s difficult for the average person to use bitcoin. When it becomes much easier, then it will be time for Kurzgesagt to make a video.
I’ll add a point I didn’t make earlier: Alternatively, it’s got to be when the use case must be better (for the collective audience) than what we currently have. For example, in places like Venezuela or Nigeria, the difficulty of using Bitcoin is worth the trade off of using it instead of their own currency (due to hyperinflation).

Why do we have to put the words “white men” in there? Just fuels more racism and sexism.

Yeah, it’s a commonality among them (that they’re old white men). I don’t have an issue with noticing this. The problem is that, a stereotype is then build, which gives preconceived notions of other old white men that aren’t true. But these voices just happen to be the loudest.
Someone like Elon Musk (an old white man) doesn’t quite hold the same views as these people regarding crypto currencies. And if we cared enough, I’m sure we could find other old white men that actually openly support crypto.

Not true. Grandmothers still use chequebooks, despite how outdated they are. That hasn't stopped EFTPOS / debit cards / credit cards / paywave / Apple Pay from taking over. The old system (cheques / banks) can continue to exist alongside the new system (credit cards / crypto), the old system just won't be mainstream anymore.
If you look at the [Diffusion Of Innovation]( you're talking about the Laggards. I imagine that we're still the early innovators because: there have been 22 million wallets ([source]( set up (which aren't even all individual people), yet we can assume 2+ billion people have access to banking in the world - that's still only 1.1% (2.5% are innovators).
So the question you should be asking is, "what will it take for early adopters to use it?"
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:11:37
No one argues that banking would stop in the future, if you re-read my earlier comments, I said they would co-exist.
Ok, maybe we can disregard ‘outrageous’ fees (sending money overseas is still very expensive though), however, the time it takes for a crypto transaction vs an international banking transaction is huge.
Inflation is solved by two things:
1. Not being able to print money (yes, blockchain has solved this).
2. Not trusting a third-party with your money ( As long as you have third parties holding your money, they continue to have the power to inflate money. This includes crypto exchanges, not just the standard banks.

You’re asking for financial advice from those unqualified. If you’re investing, read some books about investing from various sources and make your own decision. No one here, except for you, has to live with the decisions you make. Here’s a few podcasts back-to-back surrounding one specific book to get you started: 
@_date: 2019-05-21 07:12:28
**[1]** Read “[Unshakable]( by Tony Robbins and Peter Mallouk. By far the best book I’ve ever read about investing, yet very straight forward. Highly recommended.
*Outside this book, the authors may not be as reliable. Tony has become delusional from his own success, and Peter doesn’t believe in investing in crypto.*
**[2]** Watch videos by Andreas to learn more about crypto. I.e. learn about the potential of the technology itself, rather than listening to people analysing the ups/downs of the price.
Remember that no one, including Andreas, is perfect. Therefore, attempt to understand criticisms of crypto as well to make your own decision.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:25:52
The negative interest rates are a good point. Which may suggest that a video by Kurzgesagt sooner rather than later may be in the best interest for helping people avert the crisis by transitioning into the alternative currency.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:39:01
Hmmm... maybe you’re right.
I think the biggest issue right now is that it’s not easy enough to keep it secure. The other issue is that the value still fluctuates too wildly.
My point being, you may share to a bunch of people “look at this amazing technology!” and they agree - but they’ll continue sitting at the sidelines until things improve further because they’re too afraid to have their money (Bitcoin) stolen, or afraid to get exited by their bank, or afraid that their money will devalue at a random time, or something else...

In either case (to help you see things objectively), ask yourself:  
**\[1\]** Why has she not video chatted you?  
**\[2\]** What do you want out of internet dating and is that where is this going? (i.e. is she going to ever video chat with you or meet with you in real life / what does she want out of internet dating? why is she interested in you?)  
**\[3\]** Why do you care for a girl that has not video chatted AND does not live near you, when you could just meet someone else?
If you're struggling with your dating life, then I recommend reading any book written by NYTimes bestselling author Mark Manson (he's only written two books).

1) Not your keys, not your bitcoin.
2) It’s not one coin (I.e. BTC) vs the rest. Each have their place.
3) Do your own research.
4) Although people are investing into the crypto market like a get-rich-quick-scheme, you should remember why it exists in the first place. Read the books by Andreas if you have forgotten. Instead of directly investing, you could: (a) earn money in crypto, as though it were your local currency and (b) spend money, as though you were in a different country (converting the amount you need).

You’re talking about one type of risk, which people are use to having covered. Being a crypto nerd, you know the other side risks though (2008, hyperinflation in multiple countries, outrageous fees, several “business days” processing times for international payments etc). In general, people don’t trust banks and for good reason anyway, so a little bit more awareness means they now know the solution to their problem.
Effectively, as security tech improves (for example: timelock, multi-signature, hardware wallet etc) as well as convenience / ease of use (to make switching frictionless), suddenly it becomes a decision people want to make.

It’ll probably always be around. But if it does go away, another bad actor will just come along to take its place. There will always be bad actors.

Try selling it less as a “tech” and more as a “prevention from being a victim of 2008 or government actions similar to Greece / Venezuela / Nigeria etc” (or some other ideal).
Sadly, this is how most people will get into it, initially just wanting to make money from it.
I would get any beginner investor to read “Unshakable” by Peter Mallouk &amp; Tony Robbins. I know Peter’s not a fan of crypto and Tony’s a hyped self-help guru who’s gotten very circle-jerky. But this book has explained investing better than any other book has to me. Recommend it to all that come to you about Bitcoin, it’ll help them become longer-term investors (as opposed to trying to being quick-rich-schemy).

I think they would have already considered this. They would do a great Bitcoin video. However, I think the tech itself needs to advance further to make Bitcoin more accessible to the average joe, before Kurzgesagt can make a successful video about it.
EDIT: In the conversation below, I have mostly re-considered this opinion.
