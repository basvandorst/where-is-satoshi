Even though BTC is currently being pumped by outside actors?
But nah, reasoned analysis that doesn't agree with you must be botting. Enjoy the undiagnosed psych disorder ��

It's almost like pumping prices far above the most optimistic intrinsic value analysis created a bubble, and y'all are now entering the pre-crash volatility stage.
Shoulda asked your parents about the housing market crash that happened back when you were in middle school. Would've been a far less harsh lesson than losing your shit now.

Thanks for not wasting that money on helping the less fortunate.

Apparently not enough people heard of Tulip Mania.

Please, tell me what part of speculating on "magical internet money" is being creative?
You're literally blocking any rational critique of what is obviously herd-minded bubble investing in an asset that uses it's "innovative technology" cred to disguise the fact that (1) it has almost zero legitimate intrinsic use value and (2) bubbles eventually crash (that's why the tulip comparison comes to mind, not that you want to admit the relevant parallels).
Please, write off educated millennials as being either old or too luddite to understand. Ignore reason and keep throwing those illogical excuses to justify bad decisions ("it's **different this time, I swear!**").


Technology is moving in many other ways. Clean energy. Automated manufacturing. Smartphones. Virtual Reality. None of those things are scams like cryptos are. All of those things have ***real world value***, unlike cryptocurrencies (unless you're a drug trafficker or money launderer, of course).
I don't find it silly. History finds it silly. Real finance and those who study and work in finance find it silly. Your parents, who probably experienced the recent housing market collapse and learned from it, they find it silly for good reason. I'm just commenting to see how defensive of bad decisions you're willing to be. ;)

So you realize that at least tulips had intrinsic value, and BTC has literally no basis for it's current manic bubble?
If you are saying the current situation is more bizarre and unjustified, I'm inclined to agree. Magic internet money is a silly thing for people to throw their real-world hard earned money into.

Nah, there's enough stupid FOMOS rushing in that no amount of wisdom will turn them away.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:05
Nah mate. You only missed out on being duped in the latest bubble.
Not like irrational herd-mentality price bubbles ***ever*** happened before (*cough* Tulip Mania, mid-2000's housing bubble, current housing crisis, roaring '20s, 1990s tech bubble, current tech bubble *cough*).
Just put your money into an S&amp;P 500 ETF or low-cost mutual fund, like from Vanguard. Don't throw your financial future away on cryptos that will be banned in a few years.

It's different this time! I trust you! Go all in!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:03:48
I'm not sure how 500 years makes a perfect comparison of Tulip Mania somehow irrelevant to you, but let's be honest here.
Seriously, put all your money into BTC. Don't let knowledge of history or common sense stop you or anyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:51:09
Why? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:35:35
Or... invest in real things with intrinsic value, and not pump-and-dump "currencies"?

At very bougie 'magnet schools', yeah. At regular public schools, this stuff is typically only taught in highschool if at all.
