After getting it, it's honestly really surprising how simple it is. Anyone who's ever worked with crypto in almost any capacity has more than a sufficient understanding of the building blocks behind bitcoin. Satoshi certainly could've been some genius, but he also could've just been a lucky amateur who grew over time to fill the role he found himself in. (But I say that without reading much of his writing.)
I work in a software company that deals with crypto. It takes me around 20 minutes tops to explain bitcoin to my coworkers, starting from the level of how scripts work (down to what gets hashed and signed, how the stack machine works: prev txout + cur txin create full script which gets evaluated) all the way up to how using the chain of highest cumulative difficulty secures bitcoin from double spending. Point being, having the building blocks makes it an almost trivial idea to understand.

Things are moving about as fast as they can. Throwing more devs at a problem, especially new devs, won't make it go any faster.
I've submitted a patch or two to open source projects. It's usually way more work for an maintainer to code review and get into shape for the codebase than it would've been for them to just do it themselves. The investment required to get a new contributor up to speed is significant.

Don't freak out too bad. The process for restoring from the seed is independent of the wallet and even of the wordlist used. IIRC, the words are all concatenated together and hashed.

That requires trusting the sender not to double spend. Considering that the key innovation of bitcoin was solving the double spend problem, using it in such a way as to lose that benefit is barely "using" it at all. So "using" bitcoin requires giving out your address.

I would think so. A normal transaction requires you to publish both the public key and the transaction signature made with the private key of said public key. I'm not familiar with how multisig works, but I'd bet it's like this, but with multiple public keys and signatures.
And the public keys published would tell you who's keys were used.

I don't like RBF, but I don't think this argument that people can't be trusted because they have conflicts of interest is useful. It's tautological. No one can be trusted. Everyone has conflicts of interest; in the sense that they have interests at all, it's impossible to know whether they advocate based on reason or on their interests. So instead of making tautological claims about conflict of interest, which can be applied to everyone else including yourself just the same, evaluate the reasoning (or point out the lack thereof).

That view is understandable, but you could also see it as them doing what they think is necessary to survive in this pre-bitcoin-revolution era. They're necessarily going to have a lot of regulatory risk, being the biggest player in this game, so they have to be careful. In the long run, don't we gain more from having them around, making adoption incredibly easy for average people than we temporarily lose in privacy? They're helping bring about the end of the regulations, but they have to play by the rules to do so.
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:28:44




I don't see how you got the first part out of that.


It's always had undefined behavior, but, before full RBF, it had probabilistic behavior. (At least, as I understand it. Feel free to correct me.) Before RBF, you could almost guarantee confirmation by guaranteeing that the transaction had already been seen by all major miners and that no contradictory transaction had yet been seen. Probabilistic behavior can allow risk to be managed. But, with RBF, the behavior is solely a function of the other party.

Yeah, if you're looking to increase your bitcoin holdings, BTCJAM isn't a good way to do it. Most loans are USD linked, so you get back less bitcoin than you started with if bitcoin goes up in value.

Specifically, write a joinmarket plugin for Electrum.
Electrum is a thin wallet written in Python. A thin wallet is a wallet that doesn't need to download the blockchain.
This might be harder than you expect. (I mean, it's Python, so you'd expect it to be trivial, right?) There's lots of talk about it you can find on Google going back for months, but it doesn't seem anyone's actually accomplished anything yet.

I don't have a blocksize limit in mind. 1MB is almost certainly too small. But I wouldn't mind if there was a limit well below what would allow all transactions to be on the blockchain, especially in the endgame. I envision it working more as a settlement system behind multiple competing paper monies, but still open to anyone. (It just won't be worth using as a currency for normal people, but as a store of value instead.)
There are two reasons for this.
Firstly, as a means of storing information, the blockchain is incredibly inefficient. So to use it to store low value information (like your coffee transaction) is wasteful, IMO.
Secondly, since 0 conf transactions are supposedly never going to be safe, bitcoin really isn't useful for most day to day transactions.
Competing paper currencies can approximate "hard" currencies like bitcoin, but without two previously mentioned problems.
Though I admit that a blocksize limit isn't required for a situation like this to arise. It could just as well be that, even with no limit, miners' break even fees are so high that it's not worth using bitcoin for everything. If this is the case, a competing paper currency system will develop on top of bitcoin.

That's exactly it. Having 1 btc lets you trade like you have 10, 20, or 100. But if you lose enough that your actual amount of BTC is gone, you're just done. So if you take 1 BTC, lever it by 100, and lose just 1%, you're done -- tough luck, pack it up and go home.
It lets you take way more profit when you're right, but fucks you just as much harder when you're wrong.

RBF = replace by fee. They're making it so that you can respend your coins to a different address as long as 1) the previous transaction hasn't been included in a block (0 confirmations) and 2) the second transaction has higher fees.
Edit: I should say that this is the most extreme version of RBF. There are half measures that add a third condition that it must be to the same address. I didn't read the pull comments to see which version this is.

That misses the point that the block can't grow to include transactions. The point of what I'm saying is that it won't allow the block size to grow for dust. Say the miner fee is .001btc/kB. A 4kB tx would be included in a full block only if it has a .004 or higher fee.


How so? Since hashes map into the same space irrespective of the size of the data being hashed, the probabilities should be the same, I think.

As a programmer, I'm pretty sure I could write this myself in a matter of weeks/months. (Of course, you may be a programmer yourself and I don't mean to claim superiority; maybe there's something I'm not seeing.)
The way I analyze problems is to look at all the information required to complete a process and see if I have a way to get that information. To ship something to buyer, you need to know:
 1. that they paid you
 2. their name and address information
 3. what they want to order
Each QR code could be associated with a database entry that stores the item it was stamped on. Or, even simpler, each item the seller sells has it's own unique QR. When a user of the phone app (client) accesses the QR and requests a reorder (which let's me know  the server (computer at the seller's place) could generate a bitcoin address and ask the client what name/address it wants the item shipped to. The client could respond with the address (and possibly even have a setting to always respond with the user's home address, saving the user from having to manually answer). (This gives me  The server would wait an hour (for confirmation) to see if the generated bitcoin address has the correct amount of money in it ( and, if it does, start shipping the item.
So, in essence, there still is a "shopping cart system," with the server performing those duties. It's just that every seller has to run their own server. I think economy of scale would make it such that there would still be retailers. It would make more sense for this to be adopted by a retailer rather than used by manufacturers. If manufacturers were going to use this, they'd have to run their own servers and manage their own shipping direct to customer. I think they would rather specialize in making their product and leave the other stuff to retailers. Plus, with massive retailers like Amazon, you get the efficiency boost of shipping hubs and combined shipping.

True, the implication is only one way. P=NP would allow solving hashes in poly time because they are boolean algebra systems and solving boolean algebra systems is NP, but not the implication doesn't go the other way when you only solve a finite, specific hash.

First, check your address on blockchain.info and see if it still has coins. If it doesn't, check the date of the transaction that spent the coins and see if you recognize the date (to see if you remember spending them).

I just made a comment here that low value transactions should be offchain, but after thinking about it, won't that happen on it's own? We let miners decide the fees they're willing to mine for (which will tend to break even sans a blocksize limit). If the amount they want is too high (if the actual, break even cost of including them is too high), then that shunts low value transactions into offchain alternatives.
But if we include a blocksize which arbitrarily restricts supply and therefore arbitrarily increases prices, don't we just open ourselves to being replaced by another crypto that doesn't arbitrarily increase prices?

Nothing in the short run, not much in the long term. If it doubles in value (which seems kinda unlikely in the short term), you've got $20. Long term, $10,000/btc doesn't seen unreasonable. If that happens, your $10 will be worth about $250.

Doesn't work like that. The record of where it sent the coins is publicly recorded forever in the blockchain.

I guess this really could be an argument against a blocksize limit. The fees will pick up the slack either way. In terms of miner income, blocksize limit can only serve to make it possible for miners to charge more than break even, which is kinda bad. Restricting supply to less than what the market would otherwise provide is a bad idea in general.
But I should say I'm more familiar with economics than with the potential DoS vulnerabilities that bitcoin has to protect against. From a economic perspective, I would say that any blocksize limit should only be used for the purpose of preventing DoS attacks and not for economic reasons.

You would still have a very good chance of recovering the private key given the source material in similar format. Instead of having to guess arbitrarily, you have a base point and an epsilon within which to search.
It won't necessarily be trivial to write the search program, though.
Edit: actually, that would still be very computationally intensive. Even just searching 8 permutations per pixel on a 1024x768 image would be impossible. That's 8^(1024x768) images, i.e. a megafuckton of megafucktons.

No, I'm just correcting you on the mistake in assuming that time settings will be difficult to maintain in sync because we're dealing with a global network. Yet your argument seems to rely on that assumption.
Not only that, but it's also trivial to verify the order of blocks in time; they all contain a hash of the block that was the previous block when they were minded. You can get block 2 ten years after block 1 and still be able to see that block 2 contains the hash of block 1, so it came directly after it.
Where block delays matter is in orphaned chains, not in synchronization.

Betting markets require very specific statements of bets that are actually possible to verify and close. This wouldn't work because 99% of the bets would be bullshit. People aren't smart enough to only pick decidable bets, nor does this system give them much incentive to care even if they are smart enough.
Further, I'm doubtful of the efficiency of even well designed betting markets, given their incredible disconnect with reality in the recent Brexit referendum and Trump's election. I don't think they have many actual similarities with normal markets because it takes too long for results to clear, for good predictors to be rewarded with more influence and bad predictors to have their influence taken away. The selection mechanism is too weak and slow.

I'm not sure it's such a good idea to artificially restrict supply though. Shouldn't the blocksize be determined by miners setting the fee they are willing to accept and blocks being as big as they can get at the market rate? If internet is expensive, raise the fee/kB. If storage, ... Etc. If bitcoin artificially restricts supply, won't that give some other crypto an unnecessary advantage?
What's wrong with this approach?

Dude, opportunity costs. If your bullish Bitcoin, it could be rational for you to keep paying rent and hold Bitcoin.
To give an example in more traditional terms, consider a situation in which you have $10k and owe $10k in debt. If the interest rate on the debt is lower than the rate you could receive by investing the money, then you'd be better to invest it and keep paying on the debt slowly. More specifically, let's say your debt's interest rate is 3% and you can invest at 4%. Then you should invest it, earn $400 in returns, pay the $300 in debt payments, and keep the extra $100 as profit.
Now, there are complications here. No investment is guaranteed. You don't *know* you'll be able to consistently get that 4% over the term of your debt. So you have to consider that. You may have done so already and came to the conclusion you have; I'm only telling you all this so you have a chance to think it over completely in case you haven't.

I'm not convinced you can invoke Hayek in this way, and I'm somewhat familiar with his writing. (With "The Use of Knowledge in Society," at least.) How is the decision to hard limit blocksize not an example of the central planning he argues against? Wouldn't it be more Hayekian to allow completely natural competition between miners to offer the lowest rates they're willing to accept at the highest amount they're willing to supply?
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:44:52
I'm familiar with the concept that economics and complex social structures are beyond the realm of understanding and even further being the realm of being manipulated. I've read Human Action and a number of other Austrian works.
Just to get this straight, you're arguing for 1MB blocks, right? It genuinely feels to me like you're thinking literally everything I'm thinking and then reaching the opposite conclusion. I'm going to try to b quote the parts I actually disagree with so we can drill down into this.


True, which is why I'm saying we should actually leave it to the market to decide the blocksize based on an *actual* fee market. A market must reflect actual scarcity. An arbitrary restriction of supply doesn't reflect any actual scarcity. The supply should be what miners are willing to supply for the going rate, as anything else is a centrally planned deviation.
It's important to note that we don't get to decide whether the market will decide the optimal blocksize/transaction rate/fee structure. It *will* decide, regardless of what we do with bitcoin. If bitcoin is not allowed the range of adaptation to find optimal answers to those questions, it will be supplanted.


It's already planned. I'm saying we should "unplan" it. To create an artificial fee market due to an artificial restriction of supply is to subsidize the mining industry. (As a Hayekian, I'm sure you see the connection here to the general concept of protectionism. I see this as an instance of protectionism.) If a miner can't make it by charging fees at the market rate, they are, apodictically, a misallocation and should be allowed to be cleared just like any other misallocation.

I appreciate your sincerity in turn. I have interacted with you before and you struck me as an intelligent person, so I expected (rightly) that it would be worth my time to take this seriously. Perhaps that is other's excuse. You don't yet have any social capital with them.


Nothing. No blocksize (*limit). If we did this, I expect that miners would set their fees to break even with a moderate profit margin (which would be competed down over time), as prices in a free market should be. Similarly, users would adapt their consumption based upon prices. Importantly, prices, in this case, would be reflective of scarcity of actual resources, which is the goal of the market -- to balance infinite demand against finite supply of resources.
Miners who can't make enough revenue will fail. Users who think fees are too high will not consume. This is the way it should be as it ensures that resources are used optimally.

Gold is obsolete in terms of being able to replace the dollar and the system around it. You **need** a settlement system, ie clearing houses, ie ways to send "money" or *value* and not have to actually ship something (like gold or cash) across the country, ie some system that keeps track of digital accounts and handles the "settlement" (exchange of actual assets) efficiently between themselves.
To give an example, try to work through how a grocery store would buy it's produce with gold. (Remember that modern economies are absolutely dependent on long distance trade. Your oranges came from Florida or California and your potatoes from Idaho.) They'd have to hire some armored vehicle and men with guns to physical deliver it. Would this even be worth it? What's the profit they expect to make compared to the cost just to ship the money to do the transaction? The cost of the transaction, the "friction", would be cost prohibitive. Thus we *need* digital money of some sort for a modern economy to function.
I expect the current settlement system to go with the dollar. So that means we need to replace the dollar (the unit of account) and to replace the settlement system itself. Bitcoin is the perfect solution in that it is approximately zero cost to settle long distance and it's also (going to be, hopefully) a better unit of account by the time we need it.
Of course, this is all predicated on the assumption that a modern economy will survive. If you don't think that's the case, then forget about gold and buy bullets and guns, 'cause people tend to get a little agitated when the grocery store runs dry, which it will without a modern economy.
Either way, modern economy or not, gold won't be the currency. It's bitcoin (or some other digital solution) or bullets with no likely in between.

Right, but the amount that you stand to lose if the other side doesn't deliver has to be small enough that it roughly doesn't matter (like in your example of 1kb per satoshi), which requires true microtransaction support. Otherwise consumers will go broke paying fake providers and providers will be leached by nonpaying customers.
I'm assuming we won't be able to build actual blockchain contacts for this, which is likely the case as it depends heavily on input from the outside world to execute the contract. I'm also assuming reputation markets can't work due to the transient nature of this market. The only option left to make this feasible is extremely low counter party risk, which is where the microtransactions come in.

Microtransaction per packet would introduce way too much overhead, but you're on the right track. What's required is that the unit of purchase needs to be small enough that someone not paying or someone paying and not receiving what they paid for results in trivial or near trivial losses.

It's really not that hard to contribute to core, especially on the gui side. I did a few tickets just after I graduated.

If they think that's too general, then try to find a major feature that would fill a full semester (but still be doable enough for a graded attempt!).
For the paper, you could just write one explaining how it works. I've wrote such a paper on just the base level core stuff from what a blockchain is, to double spending, to a short intro to script, just enough to understand a basic transaction.

At 2 (using suits) or &lt;4 (using ranks) bits per card, that's going to take a ton of cards. Better to use the natural ordering both to get &lt;6 bits per card with a base 52 encoding.

Dude, you're out of your depth here if day trading is what this conversation brings to mind.
u/Cyril_Clunge is spot on that part of the niche that funds fill is lower than market but more consistent returns. This is achieved with techniques no day trader has ever even heard of, like maintaining a beta neutral portfolio, for example. With a good market neutral portfolio, you can exploit known correlations between certain information and returns without exposing yourself to broader market movements. It doesn't matter to us what SPY does. That usually means we make less when it goes up, but we consistently make money no matter what it does. This is attractive to people with large amounts of wealth to manage, because it gives them a product into which they can diversify that is uncorrelated with their other positions.
This isn't something small people should be involved in. I don't disagree there. Average Joe should by some ETFs and forget about it. If you have a few tens of millions to manage, then hedge funds become a viable option to consider.

Renaissance and Two Sigma have been around for around 30 years and are still many-billion dollar funds. Survivorship bias can only explain so much. They are two examples with a real advantage.
The market doesn't keep itself effectient. Information doesn't arb itself in and trends don't arb themselves out. If you can stay in the position of being the person or firm that keeps it efficient in a certain way (by being the fastest or most advanced in your area), you can consistently make profit.

The stock OS on a tmo phone or the app they give you for tethering (has to be one or the other) meters your tethering usage and caps your speed after you use a certain amount. There has to be some special software somewhere in the stack that differentiates between tethered data and normal data, since they only cap ~normal~ (edit: I meant tethered) data.
They care because they have a finite amount of bandwidth. Imagine the degenerate case where everyone bought tmo to replace their wired internet. Clearly, all of this information couldn't travel through their network at a reasonable rate, which would negatively affect user experience. It probably won't ever get *that* bad, but having a lot of users going over 1TB/mo is still concerning.

Cash has to go before rates can go negative and they need rates to go negative, ergo...
They won't *ban* cash. They'll just remove it's legal tender status and give you a grace period to convert all your paper dollars to digital dollars. After the grace period, they'll stop banks from accepting them. When the banks can't take them and businesses are dependent on the banks for their settlement system, businesses will stop taking them. Then they lose their value to all but those willing to transact outside the existing settlement system. (Which does not include many people, as demonstrated by bitcoin's adoption rate.)

That's a quantum algorithm for reversing black box functions in O(N^½). As far as I know, nothing better exists. The standard/deterministic computing brute force algorithm would run in O(N). A quadratic speedup isn't that significant. Algorithmically, it's basically equivalent to halving the number of bits. But, even so, you can't compare two categorically different types of computers.

Not really that bad compared to the general crypto market. Fees on exchanges are way higher than equities and spreads are larger, too. Some (I'm thinking not insignificant) portion of the fee is going to get eaten by execution costs in rebalancing the portfolio, assuming that isn't also passed through to the index fund holder.
There's also a missing economy of scale factor. If you're making 50 bips on a few billion, you can fund a decent team to run the fund. If you're making that on a ~50 million, you're going to have to cut some corners, at least initially. And I'm not talking about funding the bonuses for the suits, I'm talking about paying the engineers and quants to write the algos to do your trading. And you are going to need algos if you're moving real volume.
The people who can do this are very expensive talent to acquire, especially for something like an index fund where there are no PnL bonuses and where there is a much greater business risk than their normal job. I'd be asking at least $200k with a decent signing bonus to front load some payoff to offset the risk, and I'm not even that great. A good quant trader runs $500k to mid 7 figs.

Nothing is certain, but I think at least one crypto will eventually become widely used as a store of value. It may or may not be BTC. Hell, it may not happen at all. But my bet is on BTC or, less likely, a few major alts.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:12:13
Exactly. The marginal return of hodling longer drops while the marginal cost of consumption in BTC terms also drops.
If things go our way, then the calculus shifts from (at it's current state) "I could hold and 100x my value or spend all my BTC on a lambo" to (for example in the future as BTC begins to top out) "I could hold and 2x my value or spend 2% of my BTC on a lambo".
People become more likely to spend as it tops out. The ability to gain more by holding levels out to more reasonable levels, and, at the same time (since they've already made their gains), they need to spend a smaller portion of their savings to consume. That's when consumption starts happening and hardcore hodling kinda breaks down.
People will still save, but it will be less all consuming. Who really cares about doubling 2% of their value when they could have a lambo?
@_date: 2016-09-06 06:49:12

Finance was 1% of GDP in the 70's when the gold standard was fully ended. It's 4% now. I'm not sure how else to explain or how to justify such a large increase in the capital allocation sector.

It's not really that concerning, but it is true. Of course the network will be hub and spoke, since long lived channels tie up capital. You open a channel with a high capital core node which is directly connected to all other core nodes and all other individuals/businesses connect to the same or similar nodes. This is the best way to minimize pressure to close channels.
The reason this "centralization" doesn't matter is because it's low barrier to entry. Anyone who can raise capital can run a node, so they'll compete fees down to some market determined interest on capital.
The nodes don't get any say in protocols or anything like that. It's not like verifying nodes on the chain.

This is a mix of fear of a deflationary spiral and also of Gresham's law. I'm aware of both and afraid of neither. Deflation is natural. The reason people won't hold forever is because of diminishing expected marginal returns. We all hodl now because expected returns of doing so are huge. Once/if it's global (or used as a currency in some significant capacity), those returns slow down to approx the rate of human progress, at which point the calculus balances out significantly.

Someone has to offer the short side of that bet (not the exchange). That person takes on risk of BTC going up. They can either be exposed to that risk, or hedge with spot.

1) BTC can co-opt the idea if it's good, on a side chain
2) Network effects mean that a single coin should win out in the end
3) Are "smart contacts" even a thing other than ICOs? The problem with any complicated contract in any crypto is getting input from the outside world. It requires a trusted oracle, in either BTC or ETH. Creating a trustless Turing complete lang doesn't help if all your nontrivial inputs must be implicitly trusted.

It creates an arbitrage opportunity to keep the prices in line. Hedging isn't the only reason a company would trade both spot and futures. They would also trade both to profit from divergences and mean reversion in the relationship between them.
Holding a long and short position would be strictly more costly that netting them, due to margin fees. I'm pretty sure you can be long and short the same contact -- one would just negate the other leaving a position closer to 0.

That's what I'm getting at though. People can be bought, nodes can be funded, and computing power can be manufactured. It's a matter of how much all of this costs.
Imagine the banks decide they want to replace it. They'd need to hire a few blockchain knowledgeable people, setup a team to run x nodes distributed throughout the world (possibly even using vps to save money), buy a lot of mining hardware, and then outmarket/outadvertise bitcoin. I'm sad to say I think the last step would be the easiest, so it pretty much reduces to the financial viability of the first three.

 The loan I am taking is linked to USD, for example if the loan is 10BTC and at the time btc price is $250,  if price rises to $500 instantly after the loan is activated I would only have to pay back 5BTC. 
I'm speaking as a lender, if I didn't make that clear. So to repeat your example, if I loan you .01btc when bitcoin is $250, then bitcoin rises to $500, you would only repay me .005btc + interest. I want to accumulate btc, and this situation would leave me with less bitcoin than I started with, so that's bad for me. That's what I mean.
It's really unlikely bitcoin will go up that quickly in a month, but it's very possible in a year. That's why the only USD linked loans I do are month long.

A lot of people use rounded numbers and the depth at them can be enormous. If you want to buy, place it slightly higher. If you want to sell, slightly lower.

Probably billions, but certainly less than a trillion. In other words, trivially low amounts compared to what they stand to lose (control of the money supply and benefits from its inflation). Looking at the incentives of it, they'd be really stupid not to kill it for anything less than $1T or maybe more. We have quite a ways to go before we're really safe, I'm afraid.
Of course, we could always just exclude them. *Anything* is possible with a great enough majority (of actual users and miners). It'd take less than a day for a patch to be released causing the network to ignore the attackers blocks and *every* pro-bitcoin user and miner would take it, so (by definition) we would have an instant 100% majority (of the people that matter) on the change. They could continue their fork in impotence (having paid billions for their lesson in free software) as everyone who would actually use bitcoin anyway switches to our exclusionary fork.

Just a little piece of advice. If you expect the price to rise significantly and soon, like I do, it would be best to hold off loaning for awhile.

Oh wow, now I feel like an asshole for nitpicking. It's difficult to compare the bitcoin network with general purpose computers. Doing so while trying to be technically accurate will almost invariably lead to clunky wording, so I should have been more understanding of your decision to sacrifice an insignificant amount of accuracy for readability.

It may be a store of value in the future, but it's not one now until it is perceived as stable. With some more adoption, it could easily dominate everything out there as a medium of exchange, considering how it's ridiculously low friction.

If you want to use Tor, use the Tails CD.
If you want to run a node, it's pretty easy to get setup on Debian.

So VWAP isn't really that kind of algotrading. It's not used to make a profit, directly, at least. The point of VWAP is to execute a trade of a given quantity over a given period of time while minimizing the market impact. The goal is for the total trade to be executed at the volume weighed average price over the given period.
It's not about making a profit directly. It's about executing a trade in a less costly way. For example, imagine just placing a 100BTC sell order all at once. That's going to push the price down (market impact) and you'll sell for less than if you had spread it out over a longer period of time. A VWAP algorithm is just a smart way to spread the trade out.
VWAP will look better on a resume than adding scripting capabilities, as VWAP algorithms are industry standard.

If I was going to pitch bitcoin to people who are as intimately familiar with the effects of inflation as are the people of Argentina, my spiel would go like this:
1. Inflation is bad. It steals value from savers and promotes wealth inequality through asset price inflation.
2. Gold is good because it can't be inflated. (I assume they know this, just mention it bring up the topic of gold.)
3. But gold is way to expensive to transport for it to be used as the main currency of a modern economy. (Imagine your grocery store trying to ship gold across the country to pay its suppliers. They can't just load it up in a car.)
4. Bitcoin, like gold, can't be inflated. And it only costs $.03 flat to send anywhere in the world.
5. So bitcoin is a better version of gold.
This, in my mind, establishes that bitcoin is a better version of gold. Most common people already see gold as the holy grail in beating inflation (not that I'm saying they're right, IDK), so this tends to be pretty convincing.

So this testnet thing people keep mentioning is a test network for bitcoin. It works just the same, but the coins on it don't have any real value. You can get them for free from websites, even.
I don't think there are any ways to play with testnet with the simple kind of wallets (those that don't require you to download the whole blockchain). So, if you want to use testnet, you'll have to download the bitcoin core client and wait for it to download the testnet blockchain. After you've done that, go to the command line and run bitcoin-qt with the -testnet flag. Then wait a few hours. Once it's synced, you can get free testnet coins here:

Shorting is when you borrow something from someone and sell it. It's a way to profit off of downward movement in price. Eventually you have to buy it back and give it back to the original owner. If the price goes up enough (ie you lose enough money), you're usually forced by the lender to buy it back, so the lender doesn't end up losing their thing that you borrowed.

There are "seeds" for deterministic wallets which could, in some ways, be considered similar to a private key, but those wouldn't be the same thing as a normal private key. The way the seed is used is to generate actual private keys which then each have their own associated public key and address.

Eh, depending on how they're made, a hardware wallet can be tons better than a paper wallet. If any random idiot gets your paper wallet, assuming it's unencrypted, you're screwed. If someone gets your hardware wallet, they'd need a masters in EE and years of very specialized experience to get the privkey out. And even then, your privkey doesn't have to be stored in the clear. It would be trivial to write the firmware such that the unlock password decrypts the key, which gets deleted after use or after a given timeout.

The problem with dollars is holding them. They vanish in your hands. A free market in fiats wouldn't inflate so significantly.
But a free market in currency would be pointless and impossible without bitcoin, because the only settlement system they have available other than bitcoin is the dollar settlement system. And if a private currency has to use the dollar as a backing, it's fucked from the beginning.

Edit: oh, nvm. I don't think it's necessarily certain and it seems a little cultish to assert it like it's some fundamental truth. Bitcoin has first mover advantage. That's about it, afaik. That's not insignificant, but it's not a guarantee that it won't be surpassed eventually either.

Eehhhh, I don't know about that. There are some FIPS-140 verification guys that would take your bet.
But, in general, you're on point. The idea is to be safe from anyone who could be bought for less than the amount on your wallet. I would expect those FIPS guys to be very, very expensive.

Doesn't take an ID to get caught passing counterfeit bills. Physical stores are easy for the government to control because there's an easy target to which they can apply pressure. It would be trivial for the government to require stores to "test" Bitcoin like they do bills with a marker. They would require that the store report, in real time, every address that sends them Bitcoin, and the gov could check the address to see if it comes from whitelisted, declared ancestry. If it doesn't, they dispatch the local PD to come say hi.

Who gives a fuck even if you are right? The dark net drug industry does less damage to society than these tyrants. I don't think it's my head in the sand.

They could whitelist declared Bitcoin, then track every instance of unlisted coins being used. They would use physical stores like Dunkin to get a time and place for you, maybe get your picture, etc.
You don't have to show your ID at a lot of places, but if you start passing counterfeit bills, you know how that's going to end? Why do you think spending blacklisted Bitcoin would go differently?
Bitcoin needs more privacy.

But if the address isn't on the blockchain, then it couldn't possibly have bitcoins associated with it. (Ignoring zero conf, since technically they don't really belong to the address until it's actually on chain.)

Do you have any historical predictions that I could calculate a rough Sharpe on?

From the private key, you can generate the public key. And you can hash the public key to get the address.
In the bitcoin code, there is (I assume, thinking about how I would do this if I were writing it) a data structure that maps addresses to UTXOs.
You can check the map efficiently to see if the address is in it (i.e. if it has a UTXO).

Lolol. And you do? Real technical analysis is way harder than drawing pretty lines. Unless you can automate and backtest it with a Sharpe greater than 2, it's pure bullshit.
@_date: 2016-07-03 06:34:43
So, u/greengoo22, ^ is correct. This means that, yes, you do have to search all UTXOs to check if an address has any coins associated with it.
That said, this is only the case because of the way bitcoin core is written. It would be changed to make it fast to lookup any address. It's not an unsolvable or even a hard problem. In fact, it's a problem we've dealt with so much and for so long that there's a name for the solution: indexing. I won't go into what indexing is. Just know that it's a way of optimizing lookups in a database. Look for an eli5 on "database indexing" if you want more detail.
The likely reason it's written the way it is is that the index/map takes up space, writing the code to create the index takes developer time, and it's not really useful to normal bitcoin users. In fact, I can't really think of any reason to have it other than sweeping private keys, which is a somewhat rare occurrence. Given how rarely the feature would be used and the relative unpainfulness of scanning the blockchain, it's just not really worth developer time or space to store the index.
