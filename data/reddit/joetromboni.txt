Find a bar that accepts bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:41:54
Nice try, Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:23
Looks like the futures people knew what they were doing. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:55:14
Seeing the old dogetip bot brings a tear to my eye. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:36:22
Seems to me they are pretty specific amounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:55:38
Couldn't they retrieve the keys? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:29:38
Wrong, it bet most people could get a 20k credit card pretty easily. Boom. Get as many coins as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:05:40
I think people are getting the fuck out cause they see it takes hours to complete a transaction that also cost them $30 in fees.
Perhaps bitcoin has a solution for these issues and I hope it does, but why wait around if there are other coins that work and are cheap /free to transact.
That's my view. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:40:55
Throw in that litecoin dude (who used to work at Coinbase) sold his entire stash.
Everything this week was shady as fuck 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:14:59
Price doubled recently... So 2 doge = 2 doge now 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:57:08
Pump dogecoin already 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:39:26
Ya but they had 100's of coin. I'd have cashed out at 10k too if I had couple hundred coins 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:33:44
The fees will take all of your profits 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:24:56
I thought that was a given

There is an 8 year old girl in saskatchewan battling ovarian cancer. They're trying to get money to send her to the mayo clinic
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:38:25
Coinbase is shady as fuck, that's why 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:42:41
I buy my coffee with dogecoin. 1 doge fees 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:32:45
Who makes that decision, how does it get implemented 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:37:27
It's OK if it's a tesla tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:59:57
I wonder how much of that is gone.. Lost.
I lost 300 bucks on shapeshift 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:22:44
Remind me! Someday 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:31:21
It all makes sense now... Dogecoin is Satoshi, Satoshi is dogecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:46:03
Lol in the video Bob deposited 0.05 bitcoin, then they say a coffee costs 0.001 bitcoin, then they deduct 0.005 leaving Bob with 0.045.
Not good math. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:55:44
But are they crypto millionaires 
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:00:50
Hate to break it to you, but the coin that wins in the future is feeless. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:19:51
You referred to them as arbitrary. They are not arbitrary. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:25
There are lots of posts where people predict the future prices of bitcoin... 100k, 250k, or a million... Well this is how we get there. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:05:00
Nobody will ever use it as a currency if there is a fee involved. Might use it to buy expensive things, but then it's more like a bank draft than currency, and bank drafts have a fee.
Currency needs to be free and instant... 2 things bitcoin doesn't have. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:40:17
Won't make them broke over the winter either 
@_date: 2014-09-26 21:34:46
It's more like "three new york firemen heard explosions coming from the basement before the buildings fell" 
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:11:15
I always wonder when mass adoption is going to happen. Then I see things like this.
We can't even agree on a proper way to send coins to one another.
Not safe, not secure... Make sure you use an air-gapped computer next time. It's ridiculous really.

Ron Paul says the US could do away with income tax, and need just the entire budget of 1998 to get by.
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:41:51
Like litecoin or bcash or nano 
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:27:52
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:31:06
I'm not shocked. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:10:44
property taxes are supposed to pay for schools and hospitals, street lights.
sales tax pays for police, fire and other services.
corporate income tax is supposed to pay for the military.
fuel tax pays for the roads and maintenance. Plenty of other tarrifs and taxes to go around.
personal income tax goes to pay the interest on the national debt. A debt which comes from the people giving banks money and them loaning it back to us at interest.
The real theft here is personal income tax.
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:41:24
even better is fractional reserve banking
@_date: 2014-10-28 21:00:29
this is good news for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:12:10
dogecoin is where it's at
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:32:42
fiat currency is the bomb, yo!

your mom
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:39:32
Sounds illegal or shady 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:52:39
The market cap is 72 billion. Apple is 700 and Google is 550 ish. 
If the coin becomes ubiquitous all over the world, the market cap will be many times higher than these numbers. There will always be max 21 million coins. 
The global broad money is estimated at 80 trillion/21 million equals just over 3 million 
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:50:27
I've got 0.75 bitcoin, but I've never done anything with it, how do I get this new bcash? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:34:19
They can make it illegal. Then what do you do? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:36:00
I didn't know I had a choice. This is another thing preventing bitcoin from becoming mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:24:37
That's what dogecoin is for 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:41:42
This is part of the problem. You think average bitcoin users know anything about running nodes and Satoshi and mempool, and segwit and and block fee sliders or whatever... I'm just saying all that stuff needs to be invisible and just work for the average user or it will never be mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:22:06

Next, those pesky north Koreans shoot down the satellite 
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:12:25
It won't be mainstream until it doesn't cost $4 to send someone $10. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:20:56
If you are giving it away it might as well be worthless 
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:34:39
It doesn't stop you from using it, you just go to jail of caught 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:37:55
All I did was say "hey I want to send coin to this wallet and click the button" 
If that's doing something wrong then bitcoin is the problem. 
Don't get me wrong, I like bitcoin and what it can be in the future, but right now the transaction is ridiculous to the average person 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:37:26
You're probably just fucking with me, cause that's not how it works... Like at all.
Secondly, individual homeowners will never compete with huge mining operations.
Lastly, heating up water or your house by running a computer is probably the least efficient thing you can do. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:38:54
I sent myself $10 in bitcoin and it cost me $4 to do that... Seems like a bad deal 
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:01:34
Also what happens if the fees become like they were in December? 30 or 40 dollars to make a transaction... Even if 6 confirms were instant, I'm not spending that much money to transfer. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:21:43
Straight outta their ass apparently 
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:23:50
It's on binance, soooo technically they have the keys, they own it. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:33:15
It's a fact. I did it yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:34:52
How exactly do you get to the position of having no electricity cost? 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:30:54
Using the heat for other things does not mean you get free electricity. Sure you can reduce your expenses, but it also brings along new expenses. The system using the heat needs to be created and maintained and repaired. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:46:39
I prefer my zero maintenence in floor electric heating.. to having computers strewn about each room.
Best of luck to you hoping that catches on. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:37:24
One transaction consumes about 900 kwh... About the same as your house uses in a month. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:39:13
Store your wealth... , check back later you are now 35% as wealthy. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:38:53
I don't think clever people will ever think mining consumes no energy. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 23:31:40
What happens in the warm months. Can the mining computers pump out cold air too? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 11:42:44
You have to burn a lot of fuel to transport your computers where they are useful as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:13:03

@_date: 2017-11-26 03:11:32
But what's a bitcoin worth? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:00:01
Interesting they had dogecoin in there

I'm gonna get a safe and put in an old hard drive with "368 bitcoin" written on it.
It'd be nice to see the expression on their faces but I'll be dead. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:43:52
And dogecoin will be $377.86
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:20:17
Also people deserve a way to buy a lambo in a way that isn't winning the lottery. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:19:01
A dollar right now is worth about 1/8900 of a bitcoin

Bitcoin is going to end up just like every other currency. The top 1% will hold 99%
Miners will consolidate until there is only one mega mining Corp.

There's going to be a lot of lost coins in the future.
People die, wallets get lost, corrupted, shit happens. The future supply will be much less than that 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:43:07
Times that by 50 at least 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:46:12
When bitcoin is worth that much, you won't have to convert it to cash.

When you fill up with gas, why don't you just go drill the oil and refine it yourself?
When you want a steak why don't you raise your own beef cow and slaughter it and butcher it yourself?
When you have a sore tooth why don't you just give yourself a crown?
Sometimes it's easier to let other people who know what they are doing do it for you.

You'll be so rich in 110 years. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:26:33
Burying it would allow you to keep possession of the gold, but then it has no use to you. You couldn't cash it in later.
Unless you had a crystal ball and knew that 40 years later you could. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:59:17
There no doubt was a black market.
As for going to other countries... Probably not so easy in the 30s and 40s. Transatlantic flights were pretty rare until later.

I could see a lot of contractors jumping on this...they tend to like cash jobs to begin with.
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:04:14

@_date: 2013-11-19 02:41:33
how does one buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:40:34
But then how do they sting you with a $35 ticket when your time expires?
