I wanted to introduce myself. I am the owner of btcQuick. If anyone has questions about our service please feel free to reply to this comment. 
I would like to address several of the concerns people have regarding our service. We sell pre-loaded private keys. Our orders are being processed manually at the moment and that is why people may experience varying wait times. We are working on developing a new custom site as well as hiring a dedicated customer service rep to help us fulfill orders. If you have any suggestions about our service please feel free to leave a reply. 
We combat chargeback fraud by using a set of fraud detection tools and various other things to prevent combat fraud (if we disclosed these to the public it would defeat the purpose).
If you have any questions about our legitimacy please feel free to give us a call. We like getting you know our customers and to make sure that you feel comfortable using our service. Also we do not ever handle or see your credit card info. We use Google Checkout to process all our payments. Your order is placed on our site and then you are transferred to Google Checkout to make your payment.

I am sorry to hear that you had a bad experience with our service. Calling us is always the quickest way to get a hold of us and if we do not answer it is because we are on the phone with another customer. Please feel free to give us a call if you have any questions regarding your order.

Google Checkout actually works anywhere as long as its a card that they accept. You can use pre-paid debit cards as well. We have another payment method coming out next week.

What is your order # and I will take a look. 
@_date: 2013-01-25 20:43:18
Your orders will go through once your account becomes verified.
@_date: 2013-02-15 22:49:04
We are working on improving our site and our speed. Right now we are in the process of developing a custom site that will allow orders to be processed faster. Currently the reason for varying processing times is Google Checkout: sometimes they approve the CC right away sometimes it takes 15 minute-1 hour. 
Please also keep in mind that we use a cold wallet/storage system that allows your Private Key's to remain safe. Your key's are not stored in a database where they are vulnerable to hackers.
We will continue to improve our site and the speed at which we are able to fulfill orders.

Thanks for letting us know about the broken link. You will have to see if Google Checkout will let you use the pre-paid cards (as I am not certain if they do or not). If that does not work you can give us a call we can try manually process these with a different processor.
