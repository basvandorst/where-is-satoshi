thanks, hope you have fun with it!
if bitcoin get easier and more fun to use, without the paranoia security, fiddling with paper wallets etc. (and less volatility) then it can be used as a currency.
btw. i also store my saving better in a paper wallet, than block chain.info or even bitcoin qt.
but this chrome extension is for some 10 bucks...

I recommend that as you have to trust blockchain.info, as they get your private key when sending an transaction.
With the version you're right, i could add some code to send me your key after your encrypted it (e.g. a payment)
but i would then loose my credibility as my name is behind that software.
additionally i'm not from the us, but from germany and i have a family and a well paid job, so i wouldn't like to move.
Thanks for all your concerns, you're probably the wrong user for this wallet.
BTW. do you check the source code of multiBit before every update? ;)

I got the same answer when i asked the support.
i asked for an immediate refund, as the MtGox situation is now clear and i got the following response.
"Thank you for your message, we will keep our clients updated"
I hope i get my money back soon-ish :)

If you google my name (Fabian Vogelsteller) you will find everything you need to tie me to my google account and this extension.
Evil google employee. True, but as i wrote you can look at the code when its on your computer.

Through me they are familiar, though none of them really tried it. 
They can always just keep it.. for long term :) Will be a nice surprise
@_date: 2014-01-01 21:38:15
not that i know. You can check it out here: 
Its over HTTPS, so its encrypted and i personally trust blockchain.info.
 As long as you only keep 10-50 USD there, i don't see the reason why somebody would make the effort to make a man in the middle attack for that.

How long it took you?

People also can steel your wallet in the street, do you don't put money in it anymore?

Seems like they are going by the Crisis plan.
I see the hardest part in finding reliable coders and doing this in 1(!) month.
They should also tell how much they made in the last two weeks, to refill their cold storage

Here you go: 
Basically everything happens in the wallet.js: 
The wallet is not intended for your saving, but what bitcoin needs for mainstream adoption is an easy to use wallet for daily transactions.
with this wallet its easy to pay for products, paywalls or other small transactions, which is currently more a pain.
i did it with the best intentions, check out the code and see if you find any "i grab your key" holes :)

To put the security discussion to rest, i wrote a blog post. Clearly stating the risks and also gave manual installation instructions, which prevent automatic updates from happening.
@_date: 2014-01-01 22:51:38
there are no customers only users, as its free and open source...

Here is a list, but it doesn't contain "bits".
Is the "Finney" the bit?

its not working with blockchain.info wallets at all. It just uses the wallet API to send payments. Basically the private key is send over HTTPS to them when making a payment.
The problem i'm solving is ease of use and the starting barrier.
Most people are not so geeky to download a multi bit client if they just want to try it out.
Also from a users perspective its nicer to not leave the website were you're on to just pay for a paywall.


Your really believe that?
You can easily inspect the code of the wallet, when its installed. This way you can know exactly if its the same code! Just right click on the extension in the corner an click "inspect popup" (you need to activate developer mode in the settings-&gt;extensions first)
i recommend using only for amounts you also would carry around in your pocket wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-01 21:45:19
yes leave me alone :)
btcner your right with your security concerns.
But as already stated, this wallet is not intended to be super secure, but convenient.
And currently thats whats missing in the bitcoin world!
why you don't install the wallet send some 5$ there and see if it disappears. if not you have a nice little hot wallet for some satoshi dice games or whatever :)

This is a simple browser wallet i made using the blockchain.info Wallet API.
Your private key is stored encrypted in Chromes local or sync storage and only decrypted and send to the block chain.info API over HTTPS, when making a payment.

My wallet is not intended as secure bitcoin storage, for that i would use paper wallets.
If i have a blockchain.info wallet, i have to trust them. almost any wallet i have to trust somebody. Even with the bitcoin qt.
My wallet is not intended for your savings, as it is not as secure as a paper wallet, like you already figured out above. But for bitcoin to become mainstream, it needs easy wallets like my one. That's the whole point here! if you don't like it don't use it.
But to shorthand your security concerns:
* The key is encrypted and stored locally (or on googles servers if you enable sync in chrome)
* Its only decrypted when you send money
* Its then send to the blockchain.info servers (yes you have to trust them)
* Could i introduce a fake update to steal keys? I could, but you still have to decrypt it first e.g. when sending a payment and this would pretty fast get revealed, when people see their money shrink in their wallets and go check out the code (which is not that long)
* Could a evil google employee steel coins? The same as above, would be figured out pretty fast, and again, the key is encrypted.
* But exactly because of this uncertainties, this wallet is only intended for day to day transactions and NOT for savings (at least i wouldn't use to for that)
I try to bring a useful tool to the bitcoin community and help bitcoin succeed.
My main thought was that bitcoin paywalls won't be used, until there is an easy and fast way to pay for them and i believe that paywalls -- where you can pay for an article 10cents or less -- could be the big pusher for bitcoin.
but for your peace of mind: don't use it!

In germany its 1.50 - 2.50EUR and 0.80 in the supermarket... beer is cheaper than water
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:52:36
I think i got it finally.
100 satoshi = 1 bit
or 1 BTC = 1 000 000,00 bits
@_date: 2015-07-28 08:48:15


Could you point me to any reference? Because i'm working here and never hear these things mentioned.
@_date: 2015-07-28 06:57:08
I'm sorry to say but I think you have no idea what you're talking about. I'm working on the ethereum project myself and all of the above issues you mentioned are non-issues. 
The Oracle use case is just one of unlimited amount of possibilities of what you could program. And that there are external oracles is a problem for every block chain based smart contract, and will be resolved in the future, for example using multiple APIs as source, other blockchain based oracles, or a group of oracles based on smart contract based reputation etc. 
Ethereum code itself is executed in an Virtual Machine. So it can't reach out into your OS or the ethereum node itself. It's like your browser. Only because websites are Turing complete doesn't mean you can bring viruses to your computer by simply open them. 
You should really try to build a small dapp yourself and understand the principals before you make bold claims. 
Go checkout our wikis it's all working and open source.
In my opinion ethereums concept IS the HOLY GRAIL of blockchain, as it does what all the journalist and fin tech guys expect from blockchain tech. We did it and it works perfectly. Prepare yourself for the next chapter in crypto land!

You're right scalability is the only real issue i see in Ethereum, but there are also solutions for that:
1. Blockchain pruning, the important thing is the current state, not necessarily the past when we can trust that current state (And we can, pruning works easier in ethereum as in bitcoin (to ins and outs))
2. Storage gets cheaper by the day. So the data size gets less of a problem year after year
3. Computer and bandwidth gets higher, same as above
@_date: 2015-07-28 08:00:06
Ok. What you can do with ethereum, you could probably do with bitcoin after a lot of startups build extensive tools around it for 2 years and a whole new smart contract validation system... or, you just use ethereum...
Bitcoin is not made for that flexibility. Its good at moving money, and i like it for that and see currently no reason, why i would use ethereum for that. But the future of blockchain tech applications is based on ethereum IMO

it could be that when you imported the key, instead of importing the private key, it will send it to your main address. This is a safety feature.
to make sure you import the address, click "direct import"
happend to me.
