It's about financial opportunities, not dumb memes. Do you think your money will make money somewhere else? then why are you holding bitcoins in the hope that it will magically back up? in order for BTC to go up, you need more people willing to buy BTC, holding doesn't do that.

send her 10 BTC .

well there is the other side of the coin, people making money off bitcoin going down. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:21:01


loose what? when bitcoin is worth 10 cent and you bought at $18,000, you'll just be holding an empty bag with no value, while other investments (bonds, real estate, this or that security) are appreciating. 
Because that's what it is about. Your BTC right now may not give you any returns while other markets and financial opportunities are more lucrative. So yes, in essence, you are losing money, because the money you could have put somewhere else is stuck in BTC which is depreciating. 
You can argue "well it's going back up in 6 month". Sure, you'll still loosing money when other opportunities are going up right now.

well she was caught. It was a publicity stunt, she didn't code shit. So much for "women in tech" when one is suspected of being a fraud.

"hodling" is not a investment strategy. The people who ask you "hodl" you don't know if they do that in order to profit from your mistakes. Holding for the sake of it makes absolutely no sense. Nobody can say wether BTC will go up or down and when, so the "hodlers" don't know anymore than you do. 
The people with real insider knowledge are the exchanges and they are  completely unregulated. they can manipulate prices it wouldn't even be considered fraud.
BTC has no fundamentals. When EA or Apple have bad financial results people diversify and sell some shares so the price drops. BTC? it's just pump and dump and we obviously are in the dump phase. 
nothing guarantee it will go back to 20K or more.

Of course, exchanges specifically who do wash trading and plenty of fraud, keeping your assets stuck for half a year, or just stealing people's money, like Bitfinex.

she did shit.

Lol, "Bitcoin patriots" AKA "bag holders".

to prove your loyalty, buy 1 bitcoin, post your address 1 day before buying.

Who's going to enforce the "free" part in your utopia? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:27:30
That's true, since the government isn't capable of enforcing any rule at first place and most of the country is ruled by war lords. The government is on paper only.

Demonstrate your faith in BTC, buy 10 BTC today and people here will follow.

I didn't say Somalia doesn't have a government. Stop making shit up and re-read my message.

Easy, you are a 12 year old black trans-fluid and you made that app... then just collect the scholarship and pose with Tim Cook.

the sellers are people who believe BTC is going down, the buyers are people who are betting BTC is going up, it's no different than when BTC was $19,000, people who bought at that price betted BTC was going higher.
BTC doesn't produce anything, aside from transaction fees. BTC is a pyramid scheme and only relies on the fact that more people are willing to buy BTC than people are selling BTC.
Tether helped liquidify the market, the problem is that people are starting to believe less and less in Tether solvency. 
It's funny to think that "bitcoin billionaires" might have lost half their fortune in less than a month. But ultimately, them cashing in also meant them losing money in the process (since BTC depreciates when large sums of BTC are off loaded).
The only actors that are making significant money in all this are the miners and the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:32:20


Of course it is, the government is virtually existent. So no taxes, just as you want.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:07:34






That's how it works in Somalia. Why don't you want to move there? 
Actually I agree with you. Turning US into Somalia would give the rest of the world a break. So we don't disagree here.

Senior level developer here, your employer might overpay you.

BTC will only go up if more people are buying BTC. So you can make fun of 5 days accounts all you want it's investment 101. Why aren't you buying more and more BTC indefinitely to make the price go up? "HODLING" isn't going to push BTC back up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:56:36
It's always good for bitcoin...
