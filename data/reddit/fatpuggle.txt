I could be wrong, but I think you can't really have access to bitcoin in a self directed IRA.  Since Bitcoin gives you control the IRS won't know if your spending or investing it.  If it is spent then it is a taxable event.  Also the steps to buy bitcoin in a self directed account is complicated.  You need a financial institution to buy it for you because you can't have access to funds.

Why does everyone think btc is a sure thing?  The fact is btc is dead money.  I would rather invest in something that is trending up?  The trend is where the money is.

I never got into trading bitcoins for one reason.  That is, 2/5 of exchanges get hacked.  Well that was the past though.  Another reason is most coins are literally shit coins.  Why gambling on a shit coin when Bitcoin is a sure thing.  Personally, I would bet BIGGER with bitcoins rather then throw some money here and there on alt coins.  You are better off holding BTC and if you want more speculative investment I would buy small amounts of ethers or look for ICO's.

that is a good idea.  If you use bitaddress.org to generate the key pairs, you can opt to generate 7 pairs without any art work.  Transport a minute amount to one wallet and test it.  If it works, i would think it's safe to say the other key pairs are good too

to get the average just divide the bitcoin supply by the amount of users.  16million/(user base).  I heard it was either 5 or 10 million from a coinable report. Maybe that is just from United States.  So.. 1.6 BTC or 3.2 average.  Then you have to figure out people lost a lot and some wallets are basically whales and will never dump their coins from the early days. so yes a lot less then that.

web bot predictions could be errierly accurate but there are a lot to filter and most predictions are just noise.  i think of web bot predictions as a group of individuals general conscious thoughts at a point in time.  So BTC at 40,000 could mean a very huge population in China are scared of a currency event with BTC as a way to exit their monetary system.

2) On private browsing while on blockchain.info.  Generated a address, sent  btc to it, and pressed the forward or backwards button on the browser.  Did not realize that the key pair was not saved in private browsing mode.
3) Created a wallet with blockchain.info on iOS.  Sent btc to it.  It never worked!  Lost my btc.  Does not pay to be an early adopter. A month later this app was with drawn from Apple app store.
4) Forget passwords on exchanges. 
5) Exchanges got hacked

I firmly believe we are headed towards a recession.  It is literally engineered with interest rate hikes.  The hedge funds know this and are dumping stocks like crazy.  First the stock market crashes and then the housing market follows.  Gold and Bitcoin might tank with the markets.  We had a 7-8 year bull market.  Usually a bull markets last 4-6 years, so we are over do for a crash.

Not sure what your question is.  Could you be more specific.  Basically i could trade bitcoin like a stock.  If it goes up 10 bucks i could sell and make a thousand dollars.  Lately it's not uncommon for it to go up and down 80 dollars in a day or 2.  So, a perfect trade will net me around 8,000 dollars.  With regards to regulation, I would not be liable for the legality of the fund, just like if i own shares in a nuclear energy company and it polluted the area, I would not be sued.  The shares will tank and i would take a hit though.

A lot of people like me are passive investors.  From my experience it is better to not do anything when you are uncertain.  When BCH was around 800 dollars, it looked like BCH has a great chance to be adopted along side with BTC.

@_date: 2019-09-04 19:49:34
Our recessions are engineered by interest rate hikes.  Higher interest rates means higher cost to borrow and hence less people can access capital and hence less liquidity.   Recessions are more like symptoms off less money flowing into the economy.  So, the mere fact the Fed is slowing down on "printing money" is causing a recession. Having less money in the system means there is less money to bid things up...... What our leaders are doing is risking very bad inflation by keeping money so cheap for so long...

@_date: 2019-09-04 16:42:19
I think there is a good possibility there won't be a recession.  We are way over do for one but there is a possibility that the Fed is ahead off the recession curve.  I have never recollect the Fed lowering interest rates during a stock market bull trend.  It was always in the middle off the crash then the Fed panic and start lowering interest rates aggressively...  I am probably wrong so take what i say with a grain off salt.  What I expect will happen is we will consolidate into a narrow range.  I plan on buying and selling stocks around these bands.  Good luck to all..

Usually a bull matket last 4-6 years.  A recession is engineered for about 2 years to destroy the cheap money created during the bull cycle.  This keeps inflation in check.  Constant lowering of interest rates will destroy our purchasing power.  Have you not notice these last two years, how restuarants are raising prices and cutting portion sizes?  A good commercial real estate is giving a CAP rate of less then 5 percent.  It is Expensive and a rational person mind as well invest in Treasury bonds instead..
