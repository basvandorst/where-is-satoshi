Use litecoin if you want to send or buy other coins, it’s much cheaper and faster

The real satoshi wakes up with quadrillions worth of usd in btc
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:03:57
i'm 99.9% sure Hal was satoshi. Do you have a link to something that breaks down why not?? He was the first recipient of btc AND friends with nakamoto...  [

This explains Hal created BTC but David helped him, added mining: [

This artwork depicts the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto hurdling over the moon on his epic honey badger mount carrying trophies of the world's vanquished fiat currencies.

Well, they might be doing their own thing. This doesn't necessarily mean anything for BTC/LTC yet. For instance look how many etherium blockchain people are hired at jp morgan.

Because the FORK gives you bitcoin gold equal to the amount of bitcoin that you are holding, therefore you want as much BTC as possible in your electrum wallet before the fork so that when the fork happens you will have the maximum BTG. If your $ is all tied up in alts then when the fork comes you wont get anything.

hold until 100k
