A government that is $19 trillion in debt and growing.  A government that is provably corrupt.  A government that gave away its authority to mint currency to a private organization known as the Federal Reserve.  A government that bails out billionaires and leaves everyone else to fend for themselves.  Shall I go on, or are you going to continue to protect and love your wonderful government?

I will chime in for you.  The best blockchain to use is the most secure and robust blockhain in terms of overall hash power, distribution of hashpower, number of nodes, type of encryption used, etc.  Currently the top 2 most secure and trustworhy blockchains are bitcoin and litecoin IMO.  Bitcoin has a huge lead over all other blockchains, and some argue that network effects (and the ability to upgrade the code) will allow bitcoin to dominate all other blockchains for the forseeable future.  I am in this camp currently.  If you owned any smart contracts or colored coins, you would definitely want to have them stored on the bitcoin blockchain, and not some knock-off bullshit like ripple.  Let me put it another way.  If you are going to leverage a blockchain for your business needs, why would you want a private blockchain not backed by bitcoin?  When you have a free open-source blockchain which is way more secure and immutable, bitcoin.  If SHA256 ever becomes insecure, we will be able to upgrade the encryption with a hard-fork, including quantum signatures.

They should have had Segwit implemented on day1!  They should already be setup with Lightning Network, and be helping its development and adoption with the capital resources they have available.  They should be funding a full-time developer just to work on Bitcoin Core, but they have never made even 1 commit on github.  Instead they do insider trading and promote BCash.  They spam the network with high-fee, non-segwit transactions.  Coinbase is cancer to Bitcoin.

If you aren't concerned about hardware requirements, then you are not wanting a correct answer to your FUD question.  But you don't want a correct answer do you?  Nope, just using it as an opportunity to spread more negativity.  The answer is that becasue hardware requirements are low, you don't need to reply on a Coinbase or bank LN hub.  You can choose to connect to any of the thousands of hubs there will be to choose from.  You will also be able to specifically exclude hubs you don't like.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:36:29
Your argument is childish.  The reason they are fast and cheap is because they aren't being used by as many people as bitcoin, or they are a newer blockchain that hasn't had to deal with blockchain scaling problems yet, or they are much more centralized and controlled blockchains with fewer more expensive nodes.  You are leaving all of this and more out of your 1 line lame argument.

Yes, Ethereum is inherently insecure, and nobody should be putting a large amount of money into any Ethereum smart contract unless they want to wake up on day and find out OOPS Gavin Wood forgot to do something in the code and now all my money is gone.  Turing complete was always a terrible idea for a platform that is supposed to be money.  Implementations like Rootstock (safest) and Lisk are much better because the smart contracts run on a sidechain which is pegged to the main chain.

If you are into DAPP platforms other than Bitcoin sidechains, you should be looking into Lisk.  DAPPS are automatically setup as sidechains, and Javascript is the language used for development.

Think of people as nodes in a network.  Even though the nodes don't have a ton of Bitcoin each, the fact that there are a large number of nodes is a positive network effect.  Trace Mayer talks about the 7 different network effects of Bitcoin, which will allow it to take over the old system.  The node count is only one of the 7, so that kind of puts it into perspective how much impact it has.

Actually I believe there are implementations of LN that require a node being online.  After a certain threshold of time is reached, if an incorrect state is not challenged by a node with correct state (because the node has been DDoSed and is offline), then funds could be stolen.  However, newer implementations of LN are fixing this problem of nodes always needing to be online.

I agree, and this is a point that some people don't understand about alternatives to a dominate system.  You aren't going to have a lot on incentive to leave a dominate system (unless the incentives are tremendous) if it works pretty well, is convenient, and the majority accepts it.  However, once the dominate system starts having problems, then all of the sudden everyone is looking for the best alternative(s).  In this case I think the best alternatives in Greece (for now) will probably be cash, gold/silver, bitcoins.  We just need to make sure that we continue to grow our infrastructure and make bitcoin easier to obtain, store, use.  The rest will happen on its own.
@_date: 2015-06-05 04:21:59
Don't forget that you need the hardware to secure the ledger, and that your hashpower needs to continue to grow as adoption grows.  Otherwise it will fall apart, meanwhile bitcoin is still the choice of the people and continues its steady (hopefully) growth.

They do this because they want people that don't know much about bitcoin yet to immediately associate it with terrorism, drugs, etc.  If you can't see this agenda then you haven't been paying enough attention.

That is an interesting way to look at it.  We know what the money supply will be in the future due to the algorithm, so even though the coins haven't been minted yet, in a way they already "exist".

While I see both of your points I would like to say that fixing "wealth inequality" has never been a goal of bitcoin.  While the properties of bitcoin, the way it is mined, the algorithm which regulates creation of the currency, may be a more equitable distribution scheme than paper money, it still doesn't mean that people that don't work to obtain money will receive any.  Essentially it would need to be the charity of bitcoin holders to give away their bitcoins to those that have none.  Otherwise goverment force would be needed for redistribution, and we know that this is one of the main reasons that bitcoins were created.  The filthy corrupt goverments cannot take my bitcoins and give them to someone else to buy their votes.

Over the years I have questioned whether price leads or trails the mining network.  I am comfortable in saying that it has appeared to trail it.  With that in mind I believe that the price will go higher within six months after the next reward halving.  This isn't because people know it's coming and have already priced it in, but rather it just doesn't truly sink in psychologically until the halving actually occurs, and this is part of human nature.

Trezor is a hardware wallet that stores your private keys on the device.  It works with a plugin built by Satoshi Labs on Windows, Mac and Linux.  You can use 3rd party wallets, but only if they have Trezor support.  I am not sure which wallets currently work with Trezor.  If someone stole your Trezor they would need to know your PIN to unlock the coins.  If they stole your backup passphrase image, like the piece of paper you originally wrote it down on, it could be used to rebuild your wallet on another Trezor then spend them.

Economist Harry Dent was one of the few that accurately predicted the last downturn.  He believes that starting in late 2015 US markets could start their decline.  This is going to be due to "global floating interest rates" which is the true market rate, is going to rise and force the artificially low FED rate to rise.  This is also due to the "demographic cliff" that we as an American society are about to fall of of.  The aging Baby Boomer generation is retiring and as a result many will move into more conservative investments that don't include the stock market.  He was talking on the Peter Schiff show and predicted that oil, real estate, gold/silver, and bitcoin would all go down in price as well durning this massive market downturn.  This is all speculation of course.  He was simply lumping bitcoin in with all other commodities when he said this.  I believe bitcoin may become an escape route for many people around the world if capital controls continue to get worse and worse due to unsustainable national debts and unfunded liabilities.

This is a flawed argument.  Fiat inflationary currencies will still exist alongside bitcoin, gold, and other forms of "money".  My prediction is that fiat will still have an advantage in lending due to inflation in the short-term, but long-term these risks will be able to be quantified better and a market interest rate for bitcoin will emerge.  The interest rate will fluctuate based on the deflation rate of bitcoin over time.

This is exactly the mindset that Satoshi had when he created bitcoin.  He attempted to wargame all possible scenarios to make bitcoin antifragile and resistent to domination by these elite bankers.  Whether it will all work out as planned is still to be seen, but we have made a huge leap in the right direction.

Unfortunately I have to agree with you.  This is the strongest attack vector I have seen so far with bitcoin.  However, if it can win this battle and the next fork battle, then we could quite literally go to the moon in price.  Hopefully people will get their shit together soon and realize that this could destroy confidence in ALL cryptos, not just bitcoin.  Also, I suspect there are deep state and central bankers involved in this attack as well, which means this could be an all or nothing battle.

Yep, this is early days popcorn-eating stuff that great novels are written about.  Even if everything goes to zero I have have been more entertained, enlightened, and gained more knowledge about markets and psychology than I ever could have dreamed.  I used to be more depressed about the state of the world before I discovered bitcoin.  It has lit a spark in my mind and soul.  We could easily take this knowledge and apply it to new and exciting technology and markets that haven't even been invented yet.  I will say this though to give you some reassurance, this current fork problem is VERY similar to what it was like when litecoin and other alt coins started appearing, so I suspect this situation will end in a similar fashion.

I'm with you, being a free markets kind of guy myself.  All of the vitriol and hate is quite amazing.  My biggest concern over this fork drama is the store-of-value promise of bitcoin.  If a few large whales can keep forking the chain, diluting the supply (sort of), muddying the waters, confusing new people, etc.  Then it is a major setback in my view.  This fork problem affects ALL blockchain-based crypto currencies.  My best guess right now is that if bitcoin can put down 2 or more fork rebellions and remain victorious, that the threat of all future fork attacks will be tiny, confidence in bitcoin's store of value promise will be restored, and we will see the greatest moonshot to date.

@_date: 2017-08-10 18:59:32
It can, we just needed Segwit and LN first so that companies like Rootstock and others can create smart contracts using the Bitcoin blockchain.  Ethereum as a whole is complete trash due to massive scaling problems that they say will be solved with sharding, but sharding is currently vaporware.  Also, they are moving to POS which means all the hashpower will leave too.  I give ethereum a max of 2 years before major cracks start appearing. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:19:44

Yes, especially since the people involved are whales, and can manipulate these markets like this.  This fork problem has been the biggest bear signal that I have seen in bitcoin and all cryptos since I got involved in 2011.  Remember, this fork problem affects all cryptos which are open-source and use a blockchain.  This is probably the biggest make or break moment I have ever seen in crypto.  However, bitcoin has won many battles, so it is hard to say that it won't win this one too.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:46:17
If they don't have the ASICBOOST exploit themselves, then all of the other miners that do have it would have a roughly +25% advantage over you in terms of electricity cost.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:34:08
Does an antminer have ASICBOOST enabled by default?  Or does the miner have to write special code to make it work?  I thought ASICBOOST was patented and proprietary.  I genuinely don't know the answer to this, so anyone that knows the answers to this please inform us.

I agree with you to a point, but I believe this fork FUD problem is exposing one of the greatest chinks in bitcoin's armor that I have seen so far.  I am also hunkering down and hodling, and am curious how this will all play out.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:13:55
Those who jump over will have to have the ASICBOOST exploit though right?  Otherwise it would need to be roughly +25% more profitable to mine bcash before a non-ASICBOOST enabled miner would consider it.  Can you find a flaw in my logic?  I would like to be corrected if I am wrong about this.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:09:18

Bitcoin becomes more battle hardened after every attack.  Bitcoin is designed as a war-game scenario.  Bitcoin is the ultimate game theory experiment.  Bitcoin is built on using greed as an asset, not a liability.  I don't think what is happening is anything unexpected.  However, you are right that the general discussion around the protocol is at a low point right now.  I am no altcoin pumper, but I have been thinking about namecoin a lot recently, and how liberating such a protocol could be in the wake of website hosts shutting down domains they don't agree with. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:12:39
According to those scriptures you probably would be "chasing the wind" if you worked nights and weekends to obtain bitcoin.  I actually agree with those scriptures myself and don't overwork myself in the pursuit of material wealth.  With that said, I think you should still attempt to acquire 1 whole BTC because the time window for doing so is closing very fast.

I'm gonna lmao if Tone Vays was right about ViaBTC
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:00:00
If you were a bitcoin miner, would you jump over to a chain that still has the ASICBOOST exploit enabled?  From my understanding the ASICBOOST exploit allows certain miners to save between 20-30% electricity cost, effectively giving them a roughly +25% advantage over all other miners that don't have it.  Also, ASICBOOST encourages miners to create malformed blocks and even empty blocks.  Why would you want to mine on that chain if you don't have ASICBOOST yourself?  Not to mention, it appears that currently over 51% of hashpower on that chain is controlled by 1 miner.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:27:03

Once the overall market cap is in the trillions, and the network has scaled transcation throughput via Lightning and other layer 2 tech, then the price will finally stabilize to something resembling a currency.  I think 20 years sounds about right, maybe more like 50 years.  Until then, bitcoin will act more like a commodity with wild price swings.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:30:49
Maybe in the short-term, yes.  Long-term I am not so sure.  With 8MB blocks their blockchain could quickly bloat to an unsustainable size.  Also, they still have the ASICBOOST exploit enabled.  There are many unanswered questions about the long-term prospects of BCH.  I am staying on the sidelines with my free BCH for now until I see what appears to be a top.  Not sure if I will buy more BTC, speculate in some alts for the first time, or add to my physical gold and silver stash.

The gap only matters when the volume on the exchange, in this case CME, is large enough to actually create incentives for traders to go out and attempt to manipulate the spot price.  It isn't guaranteed the gap will get filled, again, it all depends on how large the whales involved in the exchange are, and how much power they have to manipulate spot prices.  But why oh why does a gap really need to be filled?  I don't know.  I'm definitely not an expert on this topic, but I do think there might be an incentive for the owners of the exchange itself to fill gaps and have less liability on their books?

No, being pro gold standard is very similar to being pro bitcoin.  Both ideologies believe in Austrian economic theory, that a currency which is limited in it's supply, by either being a base element like gold, or by having mathematical supply limits like bitcoin, helps make a good currency.  Fiat currency creators do not follow this ideology, they believe in the Keynesian economic theory of forever inflation and debt.

The problem with Monero is that the blockchain will grow exponentially over time, but for the next 5 years, yeah it's legit.  I was recently thinking about this, and the concept of a throwaway blockchain.  After the main Monero blockchain grows too big, you just spinup a Monero2.

From a quick look at all asset classes today, it appears that the USD is the big winner.  Lets face it, the USD is still the de-facto world reserve currency, and we need to grow at least 100 fold before we could hope to correlate the price of BTC to USD during a stock market move.
Edit: I would like to add that all of these markets are highly manipulated by uber-whales.

You are absolutely right, the only argument is really over the speed at which the on-chain scaling needs to happen.  Once bandwidth and storage costs have been shown to be much cheaper than today, and supply abundant worldwide, then on-chain scaling can occur which does not sacrifice the decentralized nature of bitcoin.

Thank you Mike.  As an early adopter I would like to say that raising block size at this point seems very reasonable.  Especially with the trajectory of storage and bandwidth costs continuing to plummet for the foreseeable future, I totally expected bitcoin to scale up and absorb an increasing transaction volume.  You guys have made a good case for the fork, and I fully believe Satoshi supports this change.  It seems that the bitcoinXT fork is in the original spirit of the long-term dream of true bitcoin believers like me.

A hard fork is when someone forks off of the blockchain.  A blockchain is a chain of blocks, the blocks have transactions in them.  When a fork happens, the chain is split, with one chain going one way, and the forked chain going another way, like a fork in the road.  The halving happens every 4 years, and it is a decrease in the creation of bitcoins.  Currently there are 12.5 BTC created every 10 minutes, in 2020 the halving will occur, and only 6.25 BTC will be created every 10 minutes.

I will be hodling both until a a clear trend has emerged, and a winner can safely be picked.  If BTC is winning (most probable), then dump all B2X and buy BTC.  If B2X is winning (sad, but could happen), then I will hodl my BTC to the floor, and dump some of the B2X into fiat and/or LTC.  If B2X wins, many of the Core devs will be leaving the bitcoin project, which would be a really big shame, and why I think long-term B2X will not moon like BTC would have.  This is all hypothetical.

Only a low powered piece of hardware is required.  An old castoff workstation will work fine, Rasberry Pies, etc. I would recommend a 500GB HDD or SSD to host the full blockchain and not have to worry about upgrading the drive.  Download and install Bitcoin Core from bitcoin.org, open port 8333 on your router for that machine, so you will want to reserve the ip for that machine on your network.  Once it is up and running just wait for the blockchain to sync, which could take awhile depending on your internet speed.  Once the blockchain is fully synced your node will automatically allow others to download the blockchain from it.  You can see stats for how many nodes are connected in/out etc. in the Help window.

I believe that all coins with Segwit can use the current implementations on LN.  So BTC, LTC, VTC, GRS, and more I'm sure.  Most other coins will be able to implement versions of LN that use different code, but can still swap atomically with all Segwit-enabled coins.

Payment channels have to be funded using a real Bitcoin transaction, then all of the fun LN shenanigans can occur off-chain, then when you want to close a payment channel, the final tab on your channel is tallied and you withdraw it using another real Bitcoin transaction.

Base Blocksize increase to 2MB would require a hardfork, which means that it won't happen unless the problem were so severe that all parties involved in consensus would agree.  So, it isn't going to happen anytime soon, especially when we have so many other great scaling solutions.

Nano is a DPoS network which uses a DAG.  It is nothing like Bitcoin, and should not even be compared to it.  How many large centralized servers do you think we should have running the Bitcoin network?  Right now Bitcoin has over 10,000 full nodes, something Nano will NEVER achieve.

They have a "nice scaling roadmap".  That is all they have.  Sharding is vaporware, and as far as I can reason it will never work unless Ethereum is to become highly centralized (more than it is now).  What they will end up with are large masternodes that still validate the entire chain, then shard nodes will use them to double check that certain transactions are valid that the shard can't validate on its own.  Which means that these masternodes will be the only nodes that can really be trusted.  Couple this with the fact that Ethereum developers have already shown that they are open to censorship, reversing transactions, and SJW politics (threatening to shut down the GAB DAPP on Ethereum), and you end up with a blockchain project which looks more and more like just a large corporation.

Schnorr on-chain would help scaling, but only in a linear fashion.  Bulletproofs would theoretically allow for the growth of the blockchain to be cut by 90%.  However, for world-wide millions of tx/sec, only layer 2 solutions like LN will work IMHO.

It will have to connect to a LN node which is always on correct?  Since your phone cannot host the LN node itself.  So the question is, will you be using a "trusted" 3rd party LN node, or will the app give you the capability to connect to a LN node that you run yourself?

"the infrastructure won't be ready to cope with the user load; this goes well beyond transactions per second"
This is being worked on by thousands of people as we speak.  They are creating killer apps, easy-to-use GUI interfaces, etc.  As long as they are taking advantage of Segwit, then eventually Lightning and other layer 2 tech, we will cope just fine.

The problem is that gold isn’t functioning as a currency, people are just holding expecting it to increase in value forever.

If people don’t start using gold then the only people who benefit are those who actually sell.

It is unreasonable because Core are the adults in the room that understand the importance of decentralization and sound money.  The forkers are like children who cry "wwwaaaaahhhh!!! I want it now!"  They only care about short-term profits, and not the long-term vision.  Yes, altcoins have taken a lot of market-share away from bitcoin due to this short-term thinking, but you will see in the next 5 years how many of these altcoins are poorly designed and can't scale.  Their blockchains will grow too large and become unsustainable.  Any scaling solutions they do come up with, sharding etc., will greatly lower their decentralization.

If this does happen, then I will be sadly dumping most of my bitcoins.  I, like them, will consider bitcoin to be a failed experiment.  Maybe a future experiment will be able to fix this fork problem, or maybe not, we will see.  I will still hold some of my stash, and probably hold on to some Litecoins, even though it will also be vulnerable to fork attacks in the same way.  I think even if 2X wins it will have value, but in the long run it will destroy most of the confidence I had in the idea of what bitcoin was supposed to be.  Most likely I would be putting a lot of that money into precious metals and real estate, maybe add to my stock positions with 3D printing and cannabis.  Sad to think about really, that these fucks could do this....  Mining was never supposed to be centralized like this, but then some smart son of a bitch had to create mining pools.  I have much respect for the Core devs, and really hope we can keep this project going as it is so important to the future of humanity.

Here are the technological improvements that have occurred in the last 2 years:
- Hash power has increased dramatically, which makes the network more secure
- The network was upgraded with Segregated Witness, a.k.a Segwit.  This upgrade fixed transaction malleability and effectively increased the block size from 1MB to 2MB.
- Once Lightning Network is fully up and running, and killer apps are developed for it, Bitcoin will be able to rival legacy payment systems like VISA in terms of speed and throughput.

Nodes are what make bitcoin decentralized.  They have the entire blockchain saved on them, and they are used as a consensus mechanism to validate transactions.  It is pretty easy to setup a full bitcoin node on a home PC that has at least 200GB (this amount goes up over time) of disk space to spare.  In order to be a true "full node" you also need to open port 8333 on your router/firewall.  If you go to [Bitcoin.org]( you can easily install it.  The more full bitcoin core nodes we have, the more secure our network becomes.

I am also new to bitcoin, but think I understand the underlying theory behind it.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  Cryptography is based on prime numbers because prime numbers follow no know pattern.  The next higher prime number cannot be known by knowing the previous prime numbers.  Therefore, what bitcoin does is it is constantly computing what the next highest prime number is, which isn't know until the hash is solved.  Again, I could be totally off here, but if this is the way that the system works, then it could only be trusted fully if it is on the cutting edge of discovering prime numbers.  In other words, bitcoin needs to be the leading folding network for prime number discovery.  This would also means that payoffs to miners will continue to get farther and farther apart as time goes on.

False.  Some of the best and brightest minds in the world thinking about and/or working on Bitcoin.

"Stores are dropping their Bitcoin support"
Stores have never really supported it to begin with.  It has always been fringe, and mainstream adoption has not occurred yet.  Good thing too, because it wasn't ready yet, we needed to scale it properly first.  Shill score 3/10.
"banks are once again disallowing transactions for buying crypto"
Banks had better be scared of Bitcoin, because eventually it will replace them.  Fuck banks with a rusty screw driver.  Your argument is vague, and ignores the fact that banks have been banning/unbanning crypto transactions since the beginning.  Shill score 4/10.
"It's becoming less useful, and something big is going to have to happen to turn that around."
False, it is becoming more useful everyday.  Not only are new scaling solutions and capabilities being merged into the code over time, it is also becoming more secure.  Shill score 5/10.
"It's reputation in the public's eye used to be "innovative, the future of money!", now it's "a scam / bubble that popped / technology to facilitate crime"

If an ETF is approved, moonshot.  Institutional investors will be able to invest on a massive scale, while a trusted 3rd party has custody of the coins.  I don't want that crap, but they do!  Any pension or hedge fund will be able to easily add BTC to their portfolio, which appears to be an uncorrelated asset-class.  Even a 1% allocation would cause the price of BTC to absolutely skyrocket.  Once the price starts rising at a fast rate, institutional FOMO could kick in, which would very likely allow McAfee to keep his dick.

In my early days of mining, I was using linux to keep my cost down on my mining rig.  The problem was that I am a linux noob...  I had 16.something of the mined coins in a wallet on that machine.  I copied the wallet to my thumb drive using the command, and saw that the file was on my thumb drive.  The drive ended up crashing, and when I went to recover my backup file, to my horror, the file was there, but contained 0 Kb of data.  I still don't know why it didn't copy correctly, but I just wrote it off since I had already mined over 150 coins.  Even worse, I still own over 100 shares of ASICMINER which were bought at various different prices.  Also, I never touched Mt. Gox, but think of all the people that lost everything on that site!  Eric Voorhees said he lost over 500 coins on Mt. Gox!

Coinbase does have an exchange, as Michael-Coinbase pointed out.  They also have a "Vault" cold storage wallet option, which is very secure.  However, you are then still relying on a trusted 3rd party to hold your private keys.  This means you will be voluntarily relinquishing one of the key benefits of bitcoin, immutable ownership.  For some people this is an acceptable trade-off of safety vs. freedom, for others it is not.

I'm not worried at all in the near term, and very skeptical that it will even be a threat in the mid-long term (50-100 years).  Quantum computing is MUCH more difficult than people think it is, and recently I spoke to an engineer at Intel who informed me that they currently ship 11-qubit processors to universities and private research facilities at very high cost.  The linked article mentions that an efficient and reliable 1500-qubit processor would be needed to even attempt to crack keys.  These attempts would be very difficult to pull off, even with the right quantum hardware.  By the time this type of hardware has been developed, I am assuming the cryptography methods to protect from it will be fully developed.  The main issue is that we would need to hard-fork to protect Bitcoin.

It's way more than a political party, it's the little l not the big L libertarian.  It's a big idea, an idea whose day has come.  The little l is coded into the source.  It's designed to make the current system naked and expose it's weakness and corruption.  It's nothing less than a revolution, because where the money goes, everyone else follows.  Satoshi and others knew that Austrian economics works, but no current currencies were even based on it, they are all Keynesian.  Gold and silver was the closest representation of an Austrian money that we currently have, but aren't easy to transport, nor is it easily divisible for everyday transactions.  Mining is the most important feature IMHO.  You have to "do work" to get the gold/btc.  Mining is what makes bitcoin strong.  Everyone mining bitcoins is doing it by choice.  We are taking part of our personal sovereignty back when we mine bitcoins/use bitcoins.  We are making a choice, to go outisde of the corrupt system that we have.  If you don't think that governments worldwide, including the US, aren't extremely corrupt right now, then you are not watching what is going on in the world.

You don't need to install Bitcoin-Qt on your miner unless you are solo mining, which you are correctly not doing.  Bitcoin-Qt is you local Bitcoin wallet, and I don't recommend keeping it on your miner as a security precaution.  If you have another computer, then install Bitcoin-Qt onto it and then let it synchronize, generate a wallet address, then on Slushs site copy and paste you wallet address into the receiving address.  Setup a minimum BTC amount that it will automatically send, something low like 0.1 BTC would be good.  Don't forget to encrypt your wallet and back it up on several types of media.  I do not recommend storing BTC on a 3rd party wallet ever.  Happy mining!

Thanks for the response.  I actually think the term currency is inaccurate.  People should think of bitcoin more like a commodity IMO.  If you think of bitcoin as the digital version of precious metals, then you will be much less surprised when the price rises and falls.  Will the price stabilize at some point? Yes, but it will be at least 5 years, probably more like 10 years, before it does.

The price of gold is trailing the stock market rally with a low inflation dollar.  Yes, inflation has actually been low in the USD, but that is about to end imho.  The price is not leading anything, it is reacting to what has happened in the last year.  Remember, none of the fundamental problems with the USD have been fixed, they have only kicked the can down the road once again.  THE CHICKENS WILL COME HOME TO ROOST.  I just can't tell you when.

I know that my opinions aren't always popular, but I think more people should become miners.  It's not a sexy, fast cash, get-rich-quick type of scheme, but it does tickle my nerd funnybone.  It's cool setting up the miner, configuring backup pools, using battery backup for your modem,router, and miner.  Right now of course you would only invest in the new ASIC units, which are difficult to obtain right now, but will become much easier to get soon I hope.  You might not even make as much BTC in the long run, but at least you have a steady stream of BTC coming in.  Also, you are increasing the network hashrate and security of BTC, which is badly needed right now due to the low cost of an ASIC 51% attack.

I agree with your statement, however shares could also be represented as a mere satoshi if you wanted.  Right now that isn't as feasible with bitcoin due to the dust transactions "fix", but that is only a temporary feature that was implemented to prevent blockchain bloat.  Someday even a satoshi will not be considered dust.  However, at least with colored coins you will have the option of creating a value floor if you want one.  Investors might like the idea because of the tendency of bitcoin prices to rise over time.  Even if your investment in the comapny goes bad, over time  you may be able to make a profit anyways with the value of your BTC.

I have been GPU mining for about 2 years.  When I first started I was getting over 2 BTC/day, but now only get like .05/day.  My initial cost was $1,000, and I have obtained over 200 BTC in total.  If I were starting today, then I would seek out an FPGA or ASIC (if possible).  You might be able to get a good FPGA for under $1,000, but I'm not sure you'll have to do some research.  I'm not saying you shouldn't also buy some BTC, but I think a lot of people don't consider mining because others have told them that it isn't worth if.  Could I have obtained more BTC if I had bought them?  Only if I had timed the market correctly.  Do I have any regrets for my decision to mine?  No, it has been a really fun hobby, and I have gained enough BTC to feel like I didn't "miss out".
@_date: 2013-03-21 05:06:07
You are forgetting one thing though.  You aren't accounting for the value that you added to the currency when you spent it at a lower price.  By buying lets say a pizza, for lets say 10,000 BTC.  If you were one of the original miners with half a million BTC, then that was the best 10,000 BTC he ever spent.  The gains from this one story alone are legendary.  But ultimately it comes down to the architecture of bitcoin.  Hoarding is a positive feature that was purposefully included.  In other words I am agreeing with you, hoarding a a good idea right now.  However, spending a small percentage over time to promote the BTC economy is a good idea IMO.

If you gave all poor people a million dollars today and nothing else, most of them would be poor again in 10 years with only old "Stuff" to show for it.  I know this is an over-generalization, but there is a lot of truth to it.  There is obviously bad luck, health issues, being born in the wrong country, and other circumstances which prevent people from becoming wealthy.

The US and Europe make buying, selling, or possessing bitcoin illegal.  Bitcoin becomes the new weed, everyone knows that it's a good thing and not dangerous.  It is made temporarily illegal, but just like weed, it is eventually legalized because everyone calls BS on the dirty pols.  In the meantime, we were hoarding and even transacting anonymously the whole time, generating a new address everytime we transact.  Plus, BTC is banned, litecoin or another new version pops up.

Based on my experience, yes it is still profitable, even to GPU mine with ATI cards.  Sure the profits of GPU mining are much less than they used to be, but what if you GPU mined right now, gained lets say 5 BTC, then 5-10 years down the road it's worth who knows what $1,000? $10,000? $0?  One thing is for sure though, without the security that the miners provide, bitcoin is worth zero.  It's really the only guarantee we have.

You are barely even touching your electric bill using them to mine bitcoins, and you are adding hashpower to the network of the coin you want most I presume.

Number 3, hoarding is bad blah blah blah
“In essence, the market is a fantasy,” Eichenwald wrote. “Once the hoarders stop buying, what buyers will step up to the plate to take their place? My bet? No one. There will be, at some point, a time when some hoarder decides to unload. Prices will drop. Other hoarders will get scared and start to sell. Prices will drop further. Before long, there will be a mass rush to the exits. And at that point, the illiquidity of the Bitcoin market will be apparent.” 
Guess who will be waiting there with cash in hand ready to buy up a bunch more coins.  Me, the same person that was hoarding in the first place.

Sweet,  I have always considered the rise of QC and the 51% attack to be the greatest threats to the bitcoin protocol.  It sounds like, as long as the developer community is on top of this issue, then we could create a controlled move to the QC save signature system.  The 51% attack is now the single greatest threat IMO.  If a government or shadow entity were able to manufacture enough ASIC or QC miners, then bring them all online at once, it is theoretically possible to achieve.  The cost of manufacturing enough of these miners (kind of like the clone army in Star Wars), is already in the billions of dollars today, and the longer they wait, tens of billions.  However, this plan could already be underway and we don't even know it.

I for one welcome your hashpower and think that more people should consider mining "protecting your investment", not just "what is my ROI?"  Your ROI is having a 28nm ASIC.

@_date: 2013-04-09 00:25:18
It's actually more useful at $50,000, here's why.  Network hashrate is much higher when a BTC is valued at $50,000, thus the overall security and trustworthiness of the blockchain is better.  With a more secure blockchain, bitcoin is more useful for colored coins and other not even invented yet ideas.

I think that difficulty and price a loosely related, but the next major price spikes will be the innovation of colored coins, and also the next block reward halving where it will really sink in how rare bitcoins are.  The higher difficulty does make the colored coin industry stronger because it results in a more secure blockchain.

No!  Coloring coins is just leveraging the insanely awesome security of the blockchain for other uses.  Colored Coins are just bitcoins, thats it.  If you want to uncolor a coin and spend it as a regular coin again you can.  Sure, designating some bitcoins as colored coins decreases the overall supply, but so does losing them by losing your private keys.  Also, if colored coins become popular as I believe they will, it is going to drive the demand for bitcoins even higher, the supply lower, and I think you all know what that means.^to^the^moon

Thank You!  I am getting very annoyed lately of all the progressives picking up on bitcoin, liking parts of it, but then whining about how it doesn't conform to their provably failed ideology.  Early adopters being rewarded is built into the bitcoin protocol on purpose so that people will have incentive to get on the bandwagon.

I've heard this argument before, but I disagree.  You are thinking in terms of older investments.  This new invention called bitcoin is the first of its kind and won't necessarily follow the same logical paths that we have seen for things like gold/silver or other investments.  Remember, 21million * $10,000 is only a market cap of $210 billion.  That doesn't even account for lost coins or coins that haven't been mined by the time that a BTC is worth $10K.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:39:45
Gold is not a liability, it is an asset, and an element, and there is only a finite amount of it.  Bitcoin is not an element, so gold does have some chemical value that bitcoin doesn't.  Bitcoin, in turn, has it's own values as an asset.  As far as confiscated, how will they find where you buried it?

If there were no early adopter incentive, then the participation wouldn't be enough in the early stages for the currency to take hold.  This is a crucial feature of the overall protocol, that if changed would ruin the entire design.  This overall design is based on an Austrian/Libertarian economic mindset.  The mindset that you appear to be using could be called a Keynesian/Progressive.

I agree, however I am holding out for a $100+ price before I liquidate any substantial portion of my coins.  I do think it is important to spend some of our coins as well, just a little, to increase and promote the BTC economy.

Also, my strategy includes never liquidating my last whole coin in hopes that the currency goes super-nova.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:58:42
I believe this move might be short-sighted.  While I encourage using new addresses on an individual level.  On a macro level, address reuse might be important to new innovations like colored coins, which are not the same thing as tainted, blacklisted, etc. coins.  Colored Coins may become as big of a new invention as bitcoins themselves.  We shouldn't stifle the protocol with mandates like requiring new addresses yet.

When bitcoin started, people used CPU to mine, then it was discovered that GPU could be used for a much higher hashrate/power consumption.  After that FPGA were developed which is better than GPU, but can only be used for mining bitcoin, whereas GPU can be re-purposed back to gaming, etc.  Now, ASIC's (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) have been developed which again are only good for mining bitcoin, but are leaps and bounds higher hashrate/power consumption.  They are chips that have bitcoin mining optimization coded in hardware form rather than software.  Right now I think Avalon is the only company that has successfully released ASIC's, but they currently cost 75 BTC.....  Butterfly labs has promised ASIC's, but not delivered yet.  You can get used FPGA at reasonable prices, so if I were looking today I would maybe look at that angle, but hopefully soon a good ASIC maker will emerge that that can provide real results in the marketplace.

I see what you are saying.  In my scenario I am assuming that the IPO price for each share will be above the price of 1 BTC, and that any value that the share represents above the value of BTC is what the color represents.  This also means that the value of the BTC are tied up within the color.
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:08:30
Yes, as long as you keep your holdings in btc it won't be taxable essentially.  But the incentive to cash out will grow much stronger if the price rises dramatically.

I agree with you about colored coins.  We could for the first time in history have a voting system which is publicly verifiable on the blockchain.  This is one of the most reliable ledgers known to exist due to the enormous amount of hashpower mining the (and protecting) the network.  Your vote would remain private because the entity issuing the colored coins would not keep a record of whom the addresses were issued, simply that addresses received the coins.  However, the individual receiving the colored coins can go and look on the blockchain to verify that his vote was tallied the way he wanted.  We will have a voting system with much more trust than we currently have in many venues.  However, we still have to trust that the entity issuing the ballots(coins) isn't gaming the system.  I think that many corporations, once they understand the power of colored coins, bitcoin, and the security of the blockchain, they will naturally latch onto this technology for their own benefit at very low overhead cost.

They are good, and they are a good website with great alternative health information and products.  If you are looking for your latest flu-vaccines and prescription drugs, then you are looking in the wrong place.  Natural News promotes true organic and natural living, and I love what they are doing.

I hope you see this Erik, I just wanted to say great job! Perfect!

I am very impressed by Bitcoins 0.11% marketshare.  Getting over the 0.1% mark is a huge milestone, and we have trajectory now to reach the 1% milestone.

This is how I feel about all of the haters.

If anyone from BitPay is reading.  Please do an IPO so that I can invest in you.  I have been wanting to invest in you ever since I found out about you.  You seem like an extremely well run business.

Actually, I love Ron.  We should get him back on for an AMA, then tip the shit out of him.

The only saving grace for us will be knowing that we have the best hardware wallet around (i hope) when it finally ships.  Also, 1st gen Trezor could become collectible, but this is iffy.

That's a great line, I've never heard that one before.

This is a great post.  Bitcoin is very exciting! I think once the gaming community really starts noticing Bitcoin, it will be huge.  The pace at which it moves has been breathtaking, but not unexpected.  Bitcoin was always supposed to be a roller-coaster ride.  What else can we do but hedge our bets?

I know! No more chargeback scams.  Personal responsibility for your wallet, who knew?  Encrypt your wallets people!

I've been an Alex Jones listener for over 10 years, and have been mining bitcoin for 2 years.  I guess it's too late huh.

Sorry, there is a 3rd group, and probably the largest.  True believers like me.

good point

Imagine, running around in an RPG, stop by the local card game, drop some BTC and gamble.  I don't know I can see a lot of people having problems with this, especially if the amounts of BTC being player for are too high.  Also, this could suck gambling addicts in even harder.  Still, it would be fun for those that can handle it.

I haven't used the site, but I am guessing that if there aren't many sell orders, that the highest buy orders are what is getting fullfilled by the sellers, thus driving up the bids and price.

I'm sorry, but he made a ridiculous comment that GPU mining is currently stupid and worthless.  I can't really take anything else he says seriously after such a dumb comment.  He obviously doesn't understand the original vision of Satoshi.  This was already explained in the original whitepaper.  This guy kinda sounds like a ripple peddler actually.

No, it's time to dump FIAT and buy both bitcoin and PMs

Yeah, fund the war and oppression machine.  It's the right thing to do.

You will never be able to control people like you are saying without an authoritarian system.  We are attempting to break free from those authoritarian systems using the blockchain so that AT LEAST we can know that the vote we cast is counted correctly, THATS IT.

Ok well since bitcoin code can be modified and accepted by the majority, then whoever has the most acceptance can always be Coke.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:38:30
Really?? Are you really going to complain that someone is requesting a bitcoin tip using fiat value??  This is just silly.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:29:02
now you're thinking like a bitcoiner!

I guess I am one of those gold and silver "people" that already got bitcoin years ago.  I guess I don't understand what you are saying.  Are you another one of these anti-gold/silver bitcoiners, because if you are then I am going to strongly disagree with you.

It's a revolutionary technology, a new invention, and these are very exciting times indeed.  I would caution against calling it a currency right now, as it is going to act much more like a commodity for the next 5-10 years.  Eventually it will act much more like a currency.

Sorry, but there have definitely been art bubbles that have popped before.  Certain artists or types of art can become very popular and expensive, then the fad wanes and the prices fall and don't recover.

I do not own an ASIC (i wish!), but from what others have said on here and bitcointalk, it appears that Avalon will deliver as promised.  BFL on the other hand.....
@_date: 2013-03-15 19:00:43
Wow, you are really missing about 90% of the point of bitcoin.  It is not intended as a "post-apocalyptic" currency.  Post economic-calamity, yes, but not post nuclear-war.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:36:16
I agree, I think the first major scary hacking incident where a virtual currency is completely destroyed and some people lose everything will be with a centralized currency like ripple.  Then the media can all start tearing their hair out screaming "LOOK I TOLD YOU SO!!! VIRTUAL CURRENCY IS ALL A SCAM!!!"

Lets be honest, how are they going to know unless the merchants rat us all out.
