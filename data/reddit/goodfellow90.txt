Can anyone tell me if there is any way, besides Purse, to trade Amazon gift cards for Bitcoin?

I'm all for worldwide recognition. I'm not for getting fleeced by someone who has a monopoly on crypto liquidity.
@_date: 2018-10-29 10:34:38
yay great, 3.86 new places daily to get charged 10% for exchanging crypto into fiat
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:48:38
What is, shitty Bitcoin-related drawings?
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:36:18
I doubt that number will change much after the tweet.
@_date: 2018-11-28 07:13:19
I'm not buying your bags fam

Next week on CNBC: Tom Lee eats McAfee's dick

But blockchain would limit the government's ability to overspend and pocket the taxpayer money, why would they switch to that?
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:04:19
Sam Hyde please stop
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:56:54
Yesssss yesssss, buy all my bags.

I'll rather exchange Bitcoin into fiat with someone in person than pay a 10% fee on my transaction. Most ATMs have built-in cameras; also, a malicious person can camp the ATM and easily track Bitcoin holders. I think you overestimate the anonymity of ATMs. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:03:15
MODS! MODS! MODS! MODS! MODS! 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:24:44
I doubt anyone is *willing* to lose anything.
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:44:29
Average ATM fee sits around 10%, that's just plain robbery/predatory behavior. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:06:18
That profile is very fake 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:53:47
OR you get this month 1BTC and get rekt when the price falls down even more
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:10:48
Dump eeeeeeet
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:50:07
You may not like their content but clearly there are people who do. They have as much of a right to collect money from their fans as any other creator does.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:31:19
ATM's are a sign of predatory individuals looking to fleece crypto holders with exorbitant fees, nothing else.

You say that as if r/science isn't a place where people mostly think Bill Nye is a real scientist
@_date: 2019-01-10 10:13:43
Not only, but rather mostly.
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:18:00
No its over the line scamming
@_date: 2018-11-05 11:39:47
That's generous
@_date: 2019-05-23 17:32:15
So what exactly did you do/buy that violated their rules?
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:49:43
I feel like you are trying to tell me to commit non-living
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:49:03
Business model-related question: why would I need a third party to support my favorite creator with Bitcoin though?
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:43:03
Congrats but probably not a good idea to advertise this in public.
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:42:56
I'll go with "printed"
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:56:57
Fair enough, I can see why someone would go for an incentive-backed solution. How would periodical Patreon-style payments even work with Bitcoin and the blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:18:12
Because democracy is a meme
@_date: 2018-12-22 06:30:37
Yeah that OFEC thing is an absolute outdated cancer, just recently Binance started complying with the list and banned the entire Balkans (cept Croatia) from trading on the exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:14:39
bout three fiddy
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:29:46
Imagine posting this unironically

Nothing brighter than losing 90% of your investment innit
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:17:42
Actually this is socialism but whatever
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:09:43
Because it's bad opsec

Suck it up buttercup, the rich guy had the same issues before he got himself in the position of power. He certainly didn't sit on Reddit and cry about poverty being unfair.
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:56:06
I don't think you'll find meds for that though.
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:43:36
I'll take things that never happened for a quarter chief
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:40:01
My moon is not having to read these fake poetic posts every single time I log into this website.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:07:22
One is literally free market. Other implies actual violence. If you don't want to get "hurt", don't give your money to the rich who are hurting you. It's that simple.
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:43:55
I never said you didn't have to give money to rich people. Learn to comprehend, bro.
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:35:18
This is absolutely awful
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:40:43
A-are funds safu if I have BTC on Electrum?
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:15:22
Be disingenuous less.

You show them boss

Weak flex but okay
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:42:24
Get some meds bro, paranoia is a serious matter
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:49:35
Yeah FOMO as in four more years of this bear market
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:02:21
No, I've seen plenty of people from other countries comment on dumb Reddit posts.
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:01:48
I read that most of Bitcoin in existence was mined out while the currency was below $1000.
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:53:51
Because you shouldn't be going around and telling strangers how much Bitcoin you have.
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:52:17
See you on the moon boys
