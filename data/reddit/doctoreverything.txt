You're missing the point. Yes, both Iphones and Galaxies go in flames and have issues. But Apple fixes your problems. Samsung, instead, tells you to fuck off and if you even mention the problem on the internet, they will sue you.

Can you not read or even watch a simple Youtube video? A guy's Samsung Galaxy S4 created a fire in his house and he told Samsung he wanted a refund. He also posted a Youtube video about the incident.
Samsung told him to deal with it, and that they refuse to do anything about it. They also told him to take down the Youtube video or they would take legal action. Also, they sent him forms to fill out stating that if anything goes wrong with his phone, then tough shit.
That sounds like such a great company to support.

Why am I being downvoted? da heck

I didn't say "an android phone", I meant Galaxies in general. And it isn't just one or two, or even just ten. Multiple have exploded, created fires and have leaked batteries. Samsung is a scumbag company and if you think abandoning Apple and joining Samsung is somehow boycotting Apple for their scumbag practives, then maybe you should abandon Samsung too because they have shown they don't give a rat's ass about the consumer. 
I have no idea why I'm being downvoted. I'm not an Apple supporter, but it's just funny that you guys throw hissy fits about Apple and claim its a scumbag company and then join an even bigger scumbag company.

I did and I found the definition just fine.

That's not the point, though, and yet again you people turn away from the truth.

Because IQ tests have merit, right?
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:09:02
Again, you like all others are entirely missing the point. It's not about the fact that the phone exploded/caught fire, it's about Samsungs reaction to that occuring.

How about Google it?
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:59:15
No, it isn't.
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:55:29
It's all about experience.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:40:49
Why would you get a phone made a company even more scumbag than Apple? Don't their phones explode?
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:03:47
That's why. It was all over the front page of Reddit, too.

Typical. Looks through my history and copy pasted something like a child because he couldn't make up his own argument
