I disagree with part of your reasoning on gambling scams. Websites like  and  have strong provable fairness and cannot be rigged. There is always the trust factor of having your withdrawal get processed though.

Can someone clarify this situation for me. If I'm selling to a buyer who is taking a middleman cut (they are offering the service) in NYC am I required to have a bitlicense ? 
I'm not attempting to profit but simply sell a small amount coins I bought a while ago at a rate slightly below the market to a reseller. 
It just seems ridiculous that id need to get a special license to make a one time sale worth a few hundred bucks.

I feel at the point of it's inception it was extremely important for legal purposes. Back when we were afraid of Bitcoin getting "banned" they had retained lawyers and a team that was lobbying for fair regulation. Additionally, they were well compensating Gavin and other core developers at this time. 
The foundation definitely had it's time and uses and there is a need for something similar that is run by the community at large rather than select insiders chosen by limited elections.
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:49:22
Fair point but this still seems like a lazy move, rip off another bitcoin service and steal their name. 
Magic introduced a pretty original idea as well. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:38:03
This is a blatant ripoff of "Magic": getmagicnow.com which pioneered that same service &amp;amp; accepts Bitcoin. You guys seriously couldn't think of a more original name at least ? The only difference is magic lets you order absolutely anything and has lower fees.
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:14:29

@_date: 2015-02-16 20:04:05
Websites like seals and primedice will hopefully grow large enough to force these gambling companies to implement. People are tired of waiting for checks in the mail.
I'd imagine pokerstars doesn't think the legal hassle is worth it at this point, and they could be right. On the other hand they've lost me as a potential user.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:36:26
I don't think their website has proper provable fairness, maybe they weren't online to rig your bets?
Only trustworthy places to gamble large amounts are  and  both of which have paid out hundreds of thousands of coins and they are the only very popular sites with true provable fairness.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:55:20
It's very easy to accept something as "the way things are" when you haven't experienced alternatives. 
When you hit cashout on primedice it instantly generates the transaction and the funds are in your wallet that very second.

Best of luck to them, building an effective exchange would probably take $100,000s and extensive experience though. It's going to be hard to sell that idea but hopefully they pull through
