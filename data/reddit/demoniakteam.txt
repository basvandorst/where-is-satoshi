This is demoniakteam french weed vendor. I thought evo move to the I2P??? I got this message 2 days before they close onion:
You have been selected out of a handful of vendors to beta test Evolution's new I2P Market Place. We will be creating a new I2P Marketplace in the next couple weeks. .
I2P is considered to be by far more secure than Tor within the I2P distributed Network and I2P is the superior Darknet software compared to Tor.
Our I2P marketplace will be the most advanced darknet site ever created, this will ensure that we NEVER go down and will never suffer the fate of other marketplaces on darknet. (Note: Our Onion and I2P site will be two different sites all together)
Evolution's I2P address will be  once it goes live.
If you are unfamiliar with I2P it is a browser much like tor, basically the domains end in the .I2P instead of .Onion. I2P and Tor do not function together so you will not be able to access our onion via I2P or our I2P via the tor browser.
Due to the recent darknet arrests we will not take any chances with security. Our new I2P marketplace will change the way we buy/sell anonymously online, We will also offer our vendors the option to accept DRK (darkcoin) as well as bitcoin for their payment methods.
If you do not have the I2P browser yet it is available at 
Your Vendor Invite Code to register on our new I2P is "4982AFTC"
Since you are testing our new marketplace there is NO cost to activate your vendor account on our I2P address. We are shooting to have  live on the 9th/10th/11th for testing vendors to pre-register at no cost to sell on our new market place.
If you find ANY bugs on our I2P site, please click the "Report Bugs" option at the very top of the site.
Our beta testers will also receive 25 DRK credited to their accounts on the day of public launch.
We will change the future of darknet and are glad we have you with us to share the experience.
Evolution
