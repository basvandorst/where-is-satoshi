Go to your sales history page when you log in. Is your order marked as paid? Is the order showing as 'valid' or 'expired'? I ordered 4 s9's last night and it was definitely only Bcash they accepted. Best of luck.
Edit: please make sure you are not using the fake bitmain website also. They are scamming people out of their money. You can tell its the fake site becouse it has a tiny mark under the 'n' of bitmain.

Don't you have to login to even begin the process of ordering? I'm sorry for your loss :( I don't suppose the send can be cancelled while it's still confirming?

Pretty sure that's actually wooden pellet pet litter, it looks similar to rat poison pellets but is completely harmless. It's just compressed wood dust.
Either way, I fucking love this art.

Some random guy online gave me 1 bitcoin a few years ago when they were worth £300 each. I sold it for a supermarket voucher to buy food :(

Although that makes perfect sense, what's the alternative for my Dad and the Antminer 9's he wants to buy ? He's buying a few of them in one go, and going in with a friend of his that wants some too, so he's really keen on buying them asap. Any suggestions welcome!
