Roger Ver does indeed come across as a douche, but the amount of energy this forum wastes on hating him doesn't reflect well on the state of this community. It's really kind of embarrassing honestly.

There's definitely a contingent of people that want both on chain scaling and second layer solutions. Andreas Antonopoulos would be one noteworthy example.

Yeah I tend to think a unified 2mb BTC with segwit and LN being built on top of it would've probably fared much better than what we've got now. 
It bums me out how intense (and in a lot of cases downright childish) the divide has gotten between the two camps. Feels like someone trying to implement divide and conquer tactics.

Why not both? Make the roads a little bit bigger so that there isn't tons of congestion while the engineers are building the hyperloops and airplanes.

Eh, one group gonna tell me BCH is a chinese mining cartel coin. Another group is going to say BTC is an R3 big bank blockstream cartel coin. Both narratives are plausible, not sure who to believe. Maybe both are true. Probably doesn't matter much cause I hold both coins since the fork.

Assigning blame isn't really useful IMO. Both camps have done a lot of mudslinging and I'd be very surprised if there wasn't infiltration from the current financial elite fanning the flames on both sides.
I just hope that LN will be usable soon because the average person isn't going to have the in depth understanding of cryptocurrency required to understand that smaller blocks means more decentralization and higher security. They will however, directly experience the difference in fees and transaction times.

Wouldn't wider adoption lead to more nodes though? I'd think that lower fees would lead to wider adoption. 
I understand that raising the blocksize is kicking the can down the road. It's not a sustainable long-term solution to scale, but it certainly would have bought the LN devs some time.

Yeah! I'm all for durable high quality goods that someone can take pride in having had a hand in producing. Sometimes I think it's bizarre that we describe western capitalism as "materialistic". Like if we really cared deeply about material objects we wouldn't just throw them away. We'd care for them, repair them and realize that other peoples labor and lives went into making them. 
I wonder if a factory owner holding cryptocurrency might think twice about buying a bunch of raw materials to produce disposable goods when holding onto the coins might actually make more profit. If there's also profit in not making something maybe we'd only make the things that we can also take a sense of pride from.
Maybe this kind of economy will fuck things up for the average worker though. If a lot less things will be produced, a lot less jobs will be needed. That combined with automation and AI taking over so many jobs probably makes a radical re-organization of our society very necessary.
It's definitely a weird cyberpunk future we're heading into.

BTC hits 10k AUD on the day I move to Australia. Cool.

Thanks! Will do!

I bought my first bitcoin on the notion that if people could use them to buy drugs on the internet they'd probably go up in value. That old story about VHS winning over Betamax because people could use VHS to watch porn was something a few friends and I used to joke about when we talked about bitcoin.
Wasn't until years later that I chanced upon a video explaining how fractional reserve and central banking work and suddenly I put the pieces together in my head about why this technology is so important.

Why is it a bad idea to run an economy on a deflationary currency?
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:15:08
If you're concerned about misuse of public funds you might wanna direct your energies toward war profiteers, massive corporations that abuse tax loopholes, banks guilty of fraud that received billions in bailouts etc.
Picking on an average person who just wanted to better themself without selling themself into indentured servitude via an institutionalized system of predatory lending is basically choosing the smallest fish to fry.

Wouldn't people spending less on goods en masse be an extremely good thing regarding our environmental impact though?

Why would you love to see a student fined on a minor technicality/victimless crime? Seems mean-spirited.

Yes and no. War is also funded by debasing the dollar. The Fed can't print more bitcoin so they can't force you to pay for war by devaluing your savings if they're in crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:39:31
Dollar does seem to require perpetual war to function as it does, and just after the US invaded afghanistan that countries status as the producer of 90% of the world's heroin poppies was quickly restored...
