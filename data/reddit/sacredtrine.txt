Regulation for Wallstreet.
The same people giving Balloon rides are the same one shooting them down.
Is Bitcoin going to be another wealthy coin that makes the world poor on another hidden side. Cause that is what regulation does.
They want to control the inputs and outputs.
Regulation hell no! Another coin will resurface and you can't stop the peoples response.

Well its Russian commentary with Putin fueling disparity and our blinded Truman era cold war views….
It's sad for the uninformed cause we all will drink at the same bar, work in the same office and mate and mingle with who ever we want...

Its called miners greed
they keep on over mining the coin without waiting for a developed market….
million and millions of dollars are lost to investors that just see a number and not the circuitry that makes up bitcoin….
tech companies make a fortune by making more efficient miners that become obsolete the moment they are on the street for sale.
overnight return on investment (ROI) versus the rags to riches investor abused by a financial system that the majority are sheeped into.

Citi bank pays for propaganda where BitCoins propaganda is free and voluntary to those who do advertise.

its funny how the guy with no balls gets defended while the honest one sits back and becomes rugged….
its a metaphor if you have imagination use it.
terrorists are funded with USD's and you can't stop that….
this argument is a fear tactic used by many banks that fear displacement…..
its true when a good thing appears all the opposite sides become restless fearing replacement…
I mean my wallet is bank in an economic system where I can make money when I need it,
I can tap into the international cash flow with no one entity to stop me and claim they can do it better…
cause in the its my ass that is on the line and none cares they only want USD's nuts…..
