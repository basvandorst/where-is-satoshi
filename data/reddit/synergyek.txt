btc-e? coinsbank?
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:50:28
There was another exchange claimed "hack" when price dropped from 1200, we remember.
@_date: 2018-09-27 21:28:24
Very very expensive, if you wish to produce them with correspondent quality. First batch easily can be   unusable in terms of efficiency/profitabilty.
@_date: 2018-09-30 22:20:41
Just think about millions of stolen cards. And chargebacks. And non-refundable crypto transactions.
@_date: 2018-09-29 06:58:42
You cannot buy HW from Bitfury
@_date: 2018-09-27 21:24:39
Sounds like scam. Even if they will create a bank, no correspondent banks will work with them. They will be just banned, like others crypto-friendly banks in Europe. And that's true - "crypto bank" is oxymoron.
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:33:15
Which company is card issuer? Countries restrictions, AML policies?
@_date: 2015-12-16 11:14:48
If you live in Venezuela you may not order debit cards issued by Wavecrest used by Xapo, BIT-X, E-coin etc. Anonymous Limited cards from BIT-X is only option, or you may use prepaid cards from others.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:21:13
you may order BIT-X bitcoin debit card with realtime crypto-fiat conversion at bit-x.com
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:02:18
and your card is working as promised?
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:24:09
but with xapo you should load your card with funds. on bit-x all transactions processed in realtime
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:56:18
@_date: 2016-01-03 07:48:01
bit-x.com has many options
@_date: 2018-10-21 20:05:30
Market making bots. If exchange has no volume it is not interested at all. So 90% of trading volume is a fake. Only big and sharp spikes makes sense.
@_date: 2016-06-28 23:34:01
Contact support by the phone written on the card's back, should be WaveCrest, right? They will send you a chargeback form, it's normal for plastic cards. Advice for next time - use Coinsbank cards with their mobile app where you may enable or disable card once before use
@_date: 2016-06-09 15:08:17
Try coinsbank.com card, it's the same issuer as Wirex and XAPO, but options may vary.
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:17:51
I'm agree with MrMadden. Bitcoins for VISA is like red flag for bulls. You're playing with fire.
Anyway I recommend BIT-X debit card, it's absolutely legal and clear
@_date: 2015-08-15 10:32:06
How about Bit-X.com? You could trade and spend bitcoins with their debit card. And also you could buy ghs from bitfury
@_date: 2015-08-14 12:10:51
If you need a fiat, you have to interact with someone in a middle
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:17:14
Which cards do you have?
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:20:01
Take a look at table above, for example, bit-x.com is providing real-time conversion from btc to any currency
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:16:47
Thank you. Just my 2 satoshis.
MyChoice is WaveCrest. XAPO, AdvCash uses their system.
Nanocard.eu is not providing cards.
CCEDK is using Bit-X cards also.
I think it will be better to make difference between prepaid cards and debit ones.
@_date: 2015-08-14 12:08:12
It's not a new one, they started in May 2015. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 10:16:48
Yep, Bitfury will release soon new generation of miner rigs for a mass market
@_date: 2016-02-02 19:04:51
use BIT-X.com and don'f forget to choose russian language after registration.
@_date: 2016-02-13 18:23:46
17 652 154 717 814 in Belorussian Roubles also
@_date: 2016-09-02 23:32:49
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:05:48
Their cards are not working since January 2018!
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:23:03
nobody knows real trade volumes on exchanges
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:26:39
Fck spanish Santander and thier KYC rules. You cannot close account in another branch, you have to go to the city where your account open. The same for KYC - they are asking for documents update each two years exactly in the same branch office.
@_date: 2019-01-05 09:46:44
That is a main difference between John and others. He is not scaried be politicians and around-government mafia.   
He is tired of BS and just want to make world a little bit better. Also he is wise old man, but clearly seeing a mess called "USA". And he is not afraid to die.
@_date: 2016-09-02 23:34:03
you cannot create multiple plastic or virtual cards with wavecrest and it's not anonymous at all. so FUD, be aware
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:36:31
All of exchanges are linked by themselves. And approx. 70% of their orders placed by their own bots, especially on exchanges with margin trading.
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:32:59
it's a custom chip. first version of 55nm was fully designed by bitfury team, and they just made it for 16nm. I suppose, thinner processes is nearly too.
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:40:03
This is impossible, because almost all of fiat payments are refundable, but bitcoin transactions - not.
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:46:53
Xapo, E-Coin, AdvCash cards issued by MyChoice. It's all the same.
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:35:46
just check their advisory board
@_date: 2015-09-19 10:15:37
BTW BItfury is growing. Not so long time ago they share was only 14%
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:52:43
BIT-X card was announced in the end of April 2015. And first cards they give for free at Bitcoin Conference Prague at 14 of May. At that moment Xapo cards was in deep beta-testing and didn't work
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:47:56
Only BIT-X.com is sending limited debit cards to USA. For MyChoice (e-coin, xapo, etc) it's forbidden.
@_date: 2015-10-23 22:31:33
Where is huobi, okcoin, btc china, bit-x according to  ?
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:41:50
Greece banks scared by 30 Mbps DDOS attack? What a heck
@_date: 2015-10-29 13:12:39
because when you order a card, issuer knows nothing about you. for limits raising you need to upload some documents, like on any other exchange for example, to verify yourself.
What's a problem to withdraw cash from a card? You could withdraw it in any ATM.
@_date: 2015-10-04 13:42:27
I have several bit-x cards and they works as expected. Now I have cashback rewards for my payments.
@_date: 2015-10-27 06:34:38
Who need these prepaid cards at this moment of rallying rates if you could use cards with realtime conversion like bit-x and xapo?
@_date: 2015-10-05 00:14:26
First of all, you can spend up to 90% of balance. No monthly fees at this moment, no name embossing fees. Update your data.
@_date: 2015-10-04 14:00:12
Starting from October BIT-X has two different cards (up to 10 cards per user). Please update.
And as I wrote before, MyChoice is trademark of WaveCrest Holdings Ltd and  used by Advcash, BIT-X, e-Coin, SatoshiTango, Spectrocoin, Xapo.
@_date: 2015-11-17 19:38:58
You're comparing two DIFFERENT card products. You should compare named cards from both.
@_date: 2015-10-05 00:08:17
90% of your balance. anyway it's better than ecoin ;)
@_date: 2015-10-05 00:16:36
0.5% is the only maker fee during trades on exchange on trade order execution, that doesn't matter for cards rates. Anyway no deposit fees and taker fees. Before september trading there was no trading fees.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:00:04
With Segwit activated we will get Lightning and blocksize limit will be obsolete. So 2MB hardfork is not a big price for ecosystem development.
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:33:33
MyChoice cards isn't allowed for USA residents. So, xapo, ecoin, bitx named and advcash will not send you the card. But you can order prepaid cards or bitx "anonymous limited".
@_date: 2015-10-05 00:18:19
hey, ecoin founder, please update your old data
@_date: 2016-07-15 12:05:42
Ecoin founders is ex-banksters, so not surprised
@_date: 2016-07-25 14:36:48
They have even an airport and 100 ton cannon. Why not for exchange?
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:31:04
just moving to bech32, nothing special
@_date: 2016-07-17 10:21:28
All cards mentioned by itogo has country limitations.
Named card from coinsbank.com is ok. Signup, order a card, activate it and send bitcoins to your coinsbank crypto address. BTC will be autoconverted by market rate at the moment of transaction.
 
 see restrictions for countries.

How long should we wait for Roadster if Model 3 came to market with 3-years delay?
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:59:35
Yeah, service repair performance for Ferrari. Lambo, McLaren or Bentley is the best choice.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:04:43
ALL exchanges are faking thier volumes. Including Coinbase, Bitfinex (fu..ng scammers), Bitstamp, Binance and now dead MtGox and BTC-e. Volume cannot be used as an indicator as well as price.
