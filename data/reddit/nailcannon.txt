From person to person, sure. But what about online retail? The market for that is massive and many people would have a tangible negative effect on their quality of life if that access was taken from them.

Ahh I see what you're saying. interesting point.

Yeah, I dont see that in this article. They just call it a risky investment.

In the movie Mad Max: Fury Road, the war boys were the cultish followers of the main antagonist. When one of them was about to martyr himself he would yell "witness me!" and spray his mouth with chrome paint. [here]( is the reference.
