Ok, you don`t need python and pyqt for start BitXBay. Blue screen it is windows BSoD? I mean you pc restarted after this? I think it is not problem in exe. It is my first open source release and I am noob in python 2.7, but I programming more then 7 years and never saw that my app bring bsod. Saw it sometimes with different programs on my old PC when RAM or hard drive corrupted. Try to extract content of BitXBay.zip to another folder or another drive.

Will be very difficult to find me. I try to be anonymous. Unfortunately it does not add trust to me. Many times I have thought about my safety. And doing everything alone. In any case, what will give my arrest? You can arrest Satoshi and other developers, but it's not affect Bitcoin. Anybody can make fork if interested.

It is like hold. Escrow system based on bitcoin multisig. All money in deal go only to multisig addresses and any side have only 1 key but need 2 to send money from this address. And yes you know when money go to this address. In BitXBay you can see it in comments for deal in escrow tab. You can try testnet coins or small amount of real bitcoins for make deal with yourself.

Dude, it is my first open source release but ofc I not so noob in programming(mainly in C Thx for advice, I will try to use version control correctly in next commits. Priority now is the exclusion of the possibility of hacking and fraud.

Hi. At last I finished reading all the questions and criticism for this day. By the first sorry for my English is not my native language.
For all the questions about WinXP and insecurity cracked version. I upload it for you to not afraid that your main PC will be infected than the one what can be built into my software. Have or have not this WinXP a virus, I do not know. Probable not, or at least not those that steal Bitcoins. This is a temporary solution until I completed yet version with electrum. So I make image for linux, but will have to wait. All development and rest completely on me, so I just did not have enough time for everything. If someone wants to help, you can suggest improvements or to donate something and I'll hire auditors to review the code. Here is my address for donations - 1FAvch92vioLKene4iu6wEjsPWdm67nGJK  or 16mvEuRpiDSLM7febL4okhosNSz2ybRWfM
Or just place something via sell button in decentralized tab.
About OpenBazaar/Darkmarket. Ok it is will be good but completely different. Decentralized software itself, but if you read carefully about it, you will see that is not so and all decentralized. Judges, ratings definable judges, servers, moderation goods. Nothing of this in BitXBay.
I do not believe that the rating system like in OpenBazzar can be decentralized and really honest. BitXBay uses a completely different way, which also seem to someone dishonest. My way is similar to Google Adwords, who pay more have better position but your can easy find all offers. And it is simple spam protection.
About Bithalo. Ok, developer trusted but no open source. It mean rly not decentralized. If he will be arrested or killed or can`t continue work, Bithalo die. And what about darkcoins? Premine? Way for scam.
About my code. It is far from complete, and my to do list that need to change it grows every day, despite the fact that I'm working on it all the free time. For donators, if there are large donations I'll listen to your wishes of new features, for example can add support for trade namecoin or something like that.
But unlike its competitors, in BitXBay everything working. Security will grow as you use, it never be perfect in first versions. I recommend withdraw all the money to separate wallet, except for those that need to create a next deal.

Ofc, it may be, you can use .exe on your own vmware image or any type of sandbox. I upload image it only for test with small amounts. And anyway if nobody check sources BitXBay stay trustless.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:44:01
yes, bitmessage chans and I think in future via i2p. It is like public inbox when nobody can change password. Filter for spam and ranking system use only bitcoin transactions in blockchain.

OK, you not first who say about potential danger run untested program. But I believe that all the people who run these programs on computers with Bitcoin wallet, have long since lost their bitcoins. Just run in a sandbox or virtual pc all untrusted applications.

Just because I upload binaries anywhere with btc folder with bitcoin+qt. If you want to use your installed bitcoin, you can use only lite mode with blockchain.info, or need to re-download whole blockchain with txindex 1
@_date: 2014-07-11 12:11:15
Plz, what your OS? In bitxbay folder exist /btc ? Installing python 2.7 and pyqt can help for old systems.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:36:58
I'm afraid not, as well as with lost wallets. But do not think it's worth much to worry, everything corrects course. But both parties can cancel deal if they agree on this.

It is very old message. I fix it almost instantly and you can download source form github. If you use vmware image it can`t access to your PC.
