No it was a buy wall so it was a big sell. 14:50 UTC on 9/16, you can see it on the chart. Was 2700 btc

it was on bitfinex, there was an order for around 2700 btc at $3620

It was over 2700 btc.. I'm sure there were a few small orders at the same price but the bulk of it was a single order.

Near? Pretty sure it's already at that point

it was a sell.. if you're gonna hate on bitfinex at least make sense. It was a buy wall, when it sold the price went down.
