This is only going to work with centralised "hubs" that connect people and organisations together which then pool all the lightning fees to settle on the main chain. This isn't good.
Lightning is not going to be the great solution to this problem. You can't have a decentralised off-chain solution. This needs to be discussed and made clear to people. You can't just spread misinformation as if everything is going to be fine.
Who cares if the main chain is decentralised if nobody uses it?

With a data cap that low, I'd recommend you limit your peer connections.
You will still be contributing, and you won't have any issues in the future going over that limit.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:03:59
You first have to open a L2 network with people you want to transact with. What if the L2 network you opened with is limited? Oops, can't transact with the person you want. Go back to main chain and re-do it over again.
Or alternatively, pay the hops through the L2 network to get where you need to go. How do you pay for the hops? By loaning your balance to others to pay for their hops. How much will you need? Who knows. You might need a balance 10x what you actually want to transact to be able to hop to where you need to be on the network.
Seriously. Read and understand how the lightning network will work. It's not pretty. It pretty much requires centralisation with bitcoin banks / controlled hubs.


No, you pay 1 transaction fee to get onto the L2 network, then you pay (low fees) on the L2 network which get pooled together to settle on the main network in the end - which is also why you'll be paying extremely high fees on the main network when you first start to transact.

Segwit requires users to use segwit transactions. Let's wait and see if it really does solve any problems.
Lightning network has a whole host of serious concerns behind it, mainly the centralisation of bitcoin transactions off-chain on the lightning network which requires hubs and bitcoin banks. And the reduction of utility of the bitcoin main chain due to the pooled lightning txs massively inflating main chain fees when settlements occur.
Lightning network is not going to be some magic fix, there are serious problems that haven't been addressed. Keeping block size small and adding lightning network is a recipe for disaster.

Another lie. This simply isn't true.
Let's talk about it, how much bandwidth is your full node using? 1TB a month? 2TB Really?
Oh wait, let's just say that it is somehow using a stupid amount of data, why not just... limit your peer connections slightly so that your network load is reduced, but you're still running an effective node!?

Right now you've pretty much got Core and a few fanatics opposing the entire community.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:44:13


HOW? How will it lead to "further centralisation"?
Anybody but the absolute most poverty stricken people on the planet could run a 2x node. The biggest limiting factor is internet connection rather than hardware, but even then it's mitagated by the fact that you can limit your peer connections and still remain a fully functional full node. Segwit2X blocks would not be full, they will not be 8MB blocks and this will not affect the network in any way.
Upping the blocksize further probably would cause issues, as you start to run into peer connection problems at say 16MB or 32MB blocks, but segwit2x blocks would be absolutely fine.
These lies need to stop. It takes a short time to do the calcs to determine whether or not nodes can run.

821 results, compared to 300,000+ for segwit2x. 


When tx fees got to 50c - $3, the mileage was done. There should've been an immediate contingency plan to up the blocksize to 2MB if blocks became full and tx fees rose so significantly.
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:11:04

No. That's wrong.
$1 fee per tx with 100 txs = $100 miner revenue
0.01 fee with 1,000,000 txs = $10,000 miner revenue
Higher fees do not equal more security.

I'm not saying it shouldn't be tested, but this aversion to hard forks is ridiculous.
Hard forks will be necessary in the future regardless of whatever plans people have. Hard forks will be required. People better get used to that fact.

Yes, based on his last posts. Satoshi was in favour of increasing the blocksize eventually, and didn't care about every user running a node, it simply didn't matter that much so long as there was sufficient decentralisation/distribution that was enough

Your post is beyond stupid by using ridiculously unlikely scenarios. If there was a large scale problem with the internet that we had to rely on shitty low-fi mesh networks where everybody had dial up speeds - nobody would care about fucking bitcoin. The world's economy would collapse, it'd pretty much be the biggest disaster the planet had seen in the last 80 years. On top of that, it still wouldn't fucking matter to bitcoin because if you had the ability to maintain access to the bitcoin network for the average user, you'd have the ability to maintain distributed nodes sufficiently and block size still wouldn't matter..
Put aside the wrongness of what you're saying, and just look at the stupid unliklihood. You might as well argue that we need lots of nodes because aliens are going to come down and take over 5000 nodes, so we need to make sure we can maintain more than 5000 nodes at any one time.

The support for segwit2x was about 100:1 compared to the complaints of 2X. Which amount to "never ever ever ever ever block size increase because if we allow 1 block size increase today, tomorrow blocks will be 128MB and the network can't handle that so no".
I **still** have never heard a rational reason not to increase blocks to 2MB.

I agree, but I think the extent required is simply replay protection. If people's wallets don't work, and they can't transact, they haven't lost their money and they will upgrade as necessary. That's a mild inconvenience, yes, but it's a necessary one that is utterly unavoidable. No matter what happens with bitcoin, we better get used to this eventuality. Better to learn how to deal with it now while the userbase is still relatively small.

Off chains must be centralised with "hubs" or bitcoin banks. This has been talked about by core.
Off-chains are very, very concerning.
Frankly, with the amount of push towards off-chain, who the hell cares about bitcoin decentralisation, it's going to barely matter in the end if the main chain has huge fees and nobody bothers to move off the 2nd layers.

3. What balance will be required to transact on lightning? i.e. can I deposit $10 and move that $10 on lightning, or will I need to deposit $100 to move $10 as some people have claimed.
4. As you are charged tx fees on the mainchain when you move on/off lightning, is it expected that people leave their balances in lightning for extended periods of time (i.e. 1 year+)?

Then your issue is uploads. Limit your peer connections.
You are not a good case for running a node though, your connection is at the far bottom end of consumer level. Even still, you could support 4MB blocks with 2 peer connections easily.
Hell, using that calculator 32MB blocks would be perfectly acceptable for a majority of upper level consumers to be able to support. The requirements are low. 64MB blocks are where it gets messy, with upload requirements encroaching on usual limits (for a 100/40 fibre connection), and HDD space requirements becoming excessive (3TB per year).

@_date: 2017-07-21 00:20:45
Yes true, but my point is simply that there are so many people who have much faster connections than you (100/40 + much much higher). So, why would it be a problem if we lose people with low connection speeds? We don't need to have everyone able to run nodes, we just need to have enough consumers / average people with the ability to run nodes.
So long as we don't break into the *enterprise only* level of hardware requirements, I don't see a risk or a problem.

Right, that's what I thought. That's what bugs me about this. Perhaps people were misinformed or something, but people really rallied against 2MB blocks stating decentralisation and system requirements as the reason, and then in the same breathe supported segwit. Made no sense to me.
The other thing that bothers me is that I'm not really seeing 2MB blocks as harmful (I'm guessing you don't either as I believe you support segwit). The system requirements to run a node at 2MB even up to 10MB are still quote low and well within the average / low end users reach.

Peer connections are a more significant bottleneck than bandwidth. My bandwidth is barely used by blockchain syncing due to slow peer connections. If I was saturating my connection I could sync the entire blockchain from nothing to up to date in 2.5  hours.
In fact, that might be something to consider.
Ridding the network of slow peers such as yourself (please don't take it personally) would significantly speed up block propagation and reduce the time for blockchain syncing.

Your countries lack of infrastructure is irrelevant, because it's about consumers vs enterprise, not country vs country.

I'm not messing with you, and I appreciate the genuine responses.
I'd guess that I'm not getting it because I don't fully understand how the lightning network is designed to work. I don't understand how the lightning network can complete off-chain transactions securely, which then get settled on the blockchain. I was trying to say that if the lightning network can carry out off chain transactions securely, why not design the lightning network as the entire "thing" (i.e. keep all transactions on the lightning network, forget about the bitcoin layer). To which I'd guess your answer would be the bitcoin network already exists and is already very secure. Which makes sense, but I still am not 100% convinced on how the lightning network is secure.
Anyway, I guess I have more reading to do.

I'm not talking about SPV nodes. Forgive the impoliteness, but I'm saying if we lose the ability for "poor" people, or people with crappy internet connections to run fuill nodes, nothing of consequence will happen. 
It's a false fear to say that higher requirements for nodes (but requirements still in reach of consumers) will lead to anything of consequence. Decentralisation is maintained, security is maintained, there is no downside.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:58:41


I run a full node exactly in this manner, on and off at my discretion, and when I transact. The catch up time, while mildly annoying, isn't a big deal. If it's been months, an overnight run will catch up 100%. If it's been days or weeks, starting it up a couple hours before I want to transact is sufficient.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:06:59
Well, I guess the main points that I became concerned with were:
1. The idea that the current bitcoin cores team are going against Satoshi's original vision.
2. The idea that: "Their plan is to change bitcoin’s blockchain from a payment system to a swift-like settlement system where blocks are usually, if not always, full, with only bitbanks or hubs transacting on bitcoin’s blockchain"
3. The idea that "At 16MB, an attacker can create 64MB blocks. So to increase on-chain capacity after segwit is enforced, the network needs to consider whether it can handle the max-blocksize attack."
I'm not looking for a full deconstruction of the article. I just want to know if the above is wrong, why is it wrong?

You didn't explain anything. You just claimed that it needs to be cheap for poor countries to run nodes without any explanation. Poor countries can use bitcoin even if nodes are expensive. Your explanation is ridiculous. I'm open to listening to everyone's point of view but I'm getting pretty sick of the shitty arguments put forward against larger blocks. It makes no bloody sense.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:19:02
The point is, is it a consequential number or not?
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:06:34
I agree with that point, but the two sides are talking past each other.
You're right in that over the long term, very large blocksizes will be required and that will require centralisation of nodes because the system requirements will grow to commercial and not consumer level.
HOWEVER, I also think that there is a solid case for increasing blocksize up to some larger size (perhaps even 8MB) without any adverse affects. Node system requirements remain within consumer level, and it provide temporary relief for users as transaction volumes would massively increase.
I agree with you that settlement layers need to be added on top, but I also believe that block sizes need to be increased somewhat. There needs to be a balanced increase in transaction volume capacity to maintain the normal users ability to transact on chain without enormous fees.
Let me put it this way. If block size doesn't increase, and we end up with large secondary settlement layers who do mass off chain transactions which are then settled on chain every now and then, the fees on chain would be enormous. That would limit the usage of the bitcoin blockchain to only these settlement layers and would render it affordable to the average user. What is the point of maintaining node decentralisation in such a scenario?
If the only users of the blockchain are large secondary off chain settlement layers, 99.9% of users would already be relying on off-chain security.

You bring this up as if it's a negative, but it's not. Induced demand in this situation is a good thing. We want mass adoption, we want demand to increase. We want use to increase (at least, most of the people in the community I know want it to increase). 


Yeah again, this isn't what people want. This may be what a small minority want, but not the users. Users hate the exchanges because of the amount of theft, losses, exit scams, failures, etc. That's why semi-decentralised and decentralised exchanges are popping up so rapidly. 
I'll take your word for it on the 64MB attack vector, but the other points you're making - you're stating them as if they're self-evident, when I dare say a huge portion of the userbase thinks the exact opposite of how you think,

Downloads are almost nothing running a node,unless you're constantly deleting your blockchain and redownloading (why would you?). Getting a block every now and then is not a bandwidth issue.
If you're serious and not trolling, it's uploads that people have issue with. If you're trolling, you're too ignorant to do a good job of it.

I'm not a dev, so I don't know, but I will read up on fraud proofs.

1. Segwit is bigger (effective) blocks.
2. Pretty much everyone agrees that bigger blocks (at least up to about 10MB) are perfectly fine. 2MB "block" increase after segwit is very, very hard to argue against.

The harms from sex work are much, much greater in countries where it remains criminalised.
The countries I was referring to were many in europe, and australia/new zealand. Generally sex work is only condemned in the US, and overly religious countries.

That's not an explanation, that's a statement.
If I understand correctly, you're saying that larger blocks would result in a high orphan rate, and that would result in one or two mining pools controlling the hashrate, as the other pools would have all their blocks orphaned.
* Question: Why would the other pools blocks be orphaned?
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:52:14
Right, that's pretty much my understanding. Which is why I am very confused that the people who shout down a blocksize increase on the basis of increasing node system requirements then propose an equivalent system in terms of node system requirements.
I mean, I get that it has benefits, but I feel like that totally undermines their original criticism of larger blocks. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:48:05
That doesnt make any sense.
30% hashpower equals 30% chance to find block. Ok. But why is orphan risk zero?
1% hashpower = 1% chance to find new block too

But wouldn't you agree that off-chain supplementary layers that you spoke about will be centralised and "bank like"?

I am aware, the risks are so small to be not worth worrying about.
Regardless of that, you would still be able to run a full node even with your extremely small bandwidth for transacting, you simply wouldn't be able to run a full node 24/7 and support the network. If you were only concerned about your own transactions (which is the criticism of SPV nodes) you would still be able to run a full node when required.
As for the network security concerns, again, the concerns are of a risk that is 1 in a million. It's to the degree of paranoia to ask what you're asking.
You're willing to cripple and destroy the network just to support your paranoia.

No it wasn't. Read the whitepaper. His plan was not for everyone to run a full node.
It was his plan for everyone **at the start** to run full nodes and mine.

It's not one or the other.
I don't agree with:


Spent money implementing Covert ASIC Boost.
Funded and crappy bugged BU software.
Funded a FUD campaign against the developers paying for tweets.
Won't sell to miners that may be able to compete on electricity price.
Stood in the way of a security fix for 3 years. 
Either. I don't like Jihan, I don't like monopolies. I'm just correcting a false statement.

If the lightning network acts as you say it does. Why not cut the middleman and get rid of the bitcoin blockchain? Why not simply have everyone run lightning nodes and use the lightning network to transact?
