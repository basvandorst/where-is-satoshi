Wait. What?? You want to pay up to 6.9 million Euros in cash, in 500 Eur bills?
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:22:18
Indeed. Sonething doesn‘t add up. I‘ll have to talk to their helpdesk and find out what the problem actually is. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:18:20
I had my Fidor bank account cancelled by them. Not sure about the reasons yet - they didn‘t give any. I only used that account for Bitcoin stuff, though.

Reminds me of a stupid joke I heard a while back.
So... I thought I'd relax a bit, and went to the zoo. Was very interesting. Spent some time watching the monkeys as they sit out in the open on the monkey rock, wanking furiously. After a while, I moved on to the elephants. And I was still wanking like crazy.

Am also in Germany.
What's your definition of "reliable" and what are your expectations for the exchange? You probably could
- get yourself a fidor bank account
- transfer the coins to bitcoin.de (assuming you set up a verified account there)
- sell them on the "Express-Marktplatz". i.e. bitcoin.de is a market, not an exchange. You don't get paid by the exchange, you get paid by the people buing your BTC.
If the buyer also has a fidor.de bank account, you get the money transferred almost instantly, as bitcoin.de hat a direct interface to Fidor's "Geld an einen Freund senden" API.
I bought and sold a couple of BTC and ETH that way and it was pretty straightforward. Requires verified bitcoin.de and fidor.de bank accounts, though.
Kraken ALSO has direct API access to fidor bank. So presumably you would also get the money out of kraken pretty much instantaneously. I transferred money from fidor to kraken today and it took about two minutes to show up in my kraken account.

Why not? I got one from amazon, with Prime shipping, over the weekend. No prob. And apparently the device is tamper-proof, so it doesn't matter wether you buy it from them directly. So why would you NOT get it from amazon?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:15:59
Have you looked at the other exchanges? e.g. bitstamp (  ) ? 
I'm from Europe, so I have NO idea what the deal is with Hawaii (other than that you guys have WAY better weather than we doo over here).
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:44:57
Yeah, this is bullshit. It would be that amount *only* if he'd held on to it up until today. He hasn't. And he probably wouldn't. So, it might have developed into 100mil. but he would MOST like have gotten rid of it way before that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:53:35
Out of interest, and cannot be arsed to open Excel - how do you derive your "fair value"? Is that just the average of the exchanges you list? Or do you take into account the differences in trade volume on these exchanges? i.e. do you weight the price by the trade volume?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:54:49
Oh, wow. That's cool. Thanks for the link.
Again - Dan makes great points about "Homo Economicus", doing great work in Behavioural Economics. All (OK, most) of us think we're rational beings. Just like most of us think we're not influenced by advertising. Dan's group did great work with experiments e.g. about how much people value their work, and how much work they're willing to do if somebody values their work as opposed to when it's not valued (even if it's the same amount of work). So, what motivates us to put in the effort?
Or how pricing strategies work. How companies (or even restaurants) get you to pick the pricier option. Or a pricier one than you would have otherwise. 
If you're at all interested in these kinds of processes, I can guarantee you'll come away with a couple of inspirational insights, as well as a few "Oh. Hummmm... Wow!!" moments.
It's just that, up until four weeks ago I (like pretty much everyone else) would have secretly thought "Yeah..,. pah! that doesn't apply to me". :-)

I'm using bitstamp. Am in Germany, so EU. I deposit in Euros, deposits are credited quickly. Site seems to be very stable. I have so far not run into severe problems. I had initially registered in kraken, but quickly abandoned that due to performance problems (impossible to get orders through, etc.). Bitstamp withdrawals so far have also worked fine.
So far, I'm very impressed with Bitstamp! Also, since they're registered in Luxembourg, they're fully audited and they publish their audit statements.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:49:13
I can't parse that.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:50:33
I'm in DE.
I opened a Fidor bank account. They work with bitcoin.de - having a Fidor accoun with a balance also allows you to take part in the "Express-Markt". Opening Fidor account, including verification through a live app, was a doddle. 
So far, I like the service fidor.de is offering. And as it's a free account, what do you have to lose?
I also got their credit card, but that's because I like having a separate credit card for international travel. That has nothing to do with bitcoin.de.

Copypasta of my response on another post:

Actually, they're on Fidor bank.

Nope. Neither Coinbase nor GDAX accept German customers.

I feel I should explain what I mean with "playing-around money". I'm not being flippant about money. I've put in an amount that, if lost, is not a life-changing problem for me. But still significantly enough that any return, percentage-wise is a nice windfall, hence enough to keep me interested.
And - since I`m rationalizing it to myself that I'm taking it out of my stock earnings, it's already somehow "virtual money" in the sense that if it DOES end up going belly-up, I'll have lower stock earnings than before, but not, physically, less money.
Again, this whole post is about rationalizing money vs. profit vs. loss, about introspection and learning.

... which is why I find it absolutely weird that the "Wallet" part of the Bitstamp App, which shows a deposit address and a QR code - apparently so I can show it to people to scan so they can quickly pay coins into my wallet - shows THE NUMBER OF COINS I'm holding at the top of the page. 
There's no way I can pass the QR code to anyone for a quick payment without them seeing "Damn! This dude has 0.000234 BTC".
Check this:
(not my image - Bitstamp sample screenshot)
Am I missing something obvious, or is this just plain stupid design?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:57:43
Well, it *is* still playing-around money. Only it was enough to keep me on my toes and keep me interested (yeah, I refresh Bitstamp tradeview every 10 minutes - doesn't everyone?).
You're probably right about the time horizon, though. Which supports my other point - even if I HAD had 72 BTC in 2013, I wouldn't have them any more. And not because I'd thrown them into a landfill.

Lemme guess... You've ALWAYS wanted a smaller nose but don't have the funds.

I have their iOS app. That's just as big a pile of crap as their Website. It doesn't seem to be able to correctly show the value / balance of the portfolio. When I had something like 253 ETH, it showed "(null) ETH". I have around 0.5 XBT left which I haven't move out yet. It shows those as "(null) XBT" and "USD notional" of 238.31 USD.
It's like they just don't care any more that their stuff at least shows consistent and correct numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:21:41
Like many "prophets" or "fortune tellers" - make enough wild predictions, sooner or later one will be correct. Nobody remembers the dudes who spouted rubbish. But if you're one of the ones who managed to pick the correct bullshit prediction, you're gonna milk it forever. Like all those guys who "predicted the Wall Street crash". 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:44:51
Am doing the same, also going to Bitstamp. Only, suddenly Kraken is blocking my Withdrawal, claming it's above the threshold for my verification level (3). It's WAY below those levels, though. So they cannot even get that right. What a p.o.s.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:38:35
Nope, no luck. Still not working. I still get "Your current funding tier level (3) is insufficient for this functionality. Please further verify your account to increase your tier level and funding limits."
Looks like I'll have to contact support.

"So what?" could be the public awareness around it. *ALL* the media outlets are reporting about it very loudly and excitedly. A lot of folks came into this expecting it to rise. Many of them got burned. 
So, while the percentages might be comparable, the awareness is definitely not.
