What monitoring software is that?
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:21:16
Lol.. I'm not taking sides here cause this is all over my head but where are your sources??

This is an awesome answer, thank you so much. Would love to hear your further insights:
I've read all about 1password's security and I feel like a bruteforce on my 1password database is pretty much impossible given the requirement for both my master password and the account key.
I like the fact that everything is end-to-end encrypted, and nothing is stored on their servers besides the encrypted database.
So, even given the above and the fact that I have a master password with 108 bits of entropy you'd still advise strongly against doing it?
I feel like the risk of me losing my seed (Misplaced, lost, stolen, discovered by untrusted person, burned in fire, etc) are far greater than all of the 1password risks.

Why doesn't it cease to be mine when it goes on passphrase.io?

 is no longer supporting CAD. USD only.

Thanks a lot! This one looks great.

Google may not be selling information but they sure are capitalizing on it (think ads).
Either way, we've kind of gone off track. My concern isn't Apple or Google gaining info about me. It's more the inherent security of the mobile OSes each company makes and how they are used. 
I would trust my bitcoin on iOS far more than on Android.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:38:32
LOL why would I look into your large posting history (good for you, btw) to respond to your kneejerk comment about Apple iOS?
Better privacy from Google? You must be joking too.
~~And one of the better mobile wallets exists solely on iOS for this very reason: 
EDIT: it looks like Bread has moved to Android too. Good for them!

I would argue Apple is far less concerned with data collection than Google is. Google doesn't necessarily earn huge amounts of revenue from every Android OS device out there. Apple does due to its tight hardware/software integration. Apple does not have nearly as much incentive to collect and profit on users' data. In fact, I'm not sure if there's an evidence that they do. Have you seen any?
Apple's iOS is far better sandboxed than Android as well, if you look into the low level security of the OS.

Funny comment from someone in a thread about keeping crypto currency on their mobile phone. 
Apple iOS is miles ahead of android for security and privacy.

You do realize the face scan is stored extremely securely on your iPhone. No one will ever have access to it. Also it's not a requirement to enable faceid.
Compared to android iPhones are also way more secure from a privacy standpoint.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:39:28
So Android is more secure? Do enlighten me..
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:48:39
I'm not talking about features.. I'm talking about security. You've shifted the conversation completely away from "Apple is not secure" to "Android has more features". That doesn't exactly help your argument against Apple's security.

Surely he meant to say "...inside the blocks that they have mined." Right?
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:58:13
Great article. Need help understanding though. If no one bought bitcoin, wouldn’t the miner rewards just be accruing? The miners don’t have to sell them do they? I don’t see why that would drive the price to zero.
@_date: 2016-10-17 19:06:25
Thanks for the responses.
So, is the quantum attack basically some brute-force thing where they try and derive a priavte key that matches the public key?
@_date: 2016-10-18 03:24:56
Like never ever use paper wallet? Why not?
@_date: 2016-10-18 14:05:10
I really appreciate the advice but could you back it up a bit? Are you implying that even when following all of the security advice on the paper wallet (generate offline, printer memory, etc) that they should still never be considered? Why?
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:08:03
The internet is a lot older than 1995, my friend...
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:21:02
The analogy is actually a very temporal one. Go check again. You said the early- and mid- nineties were the lead up to the boom (implying mass adoption). Who knows how far away the bitcoin boom is, we certainly aren’t there yet.
The OP was implying that *today* Internet users have no need to know anything about TCP/IP due to huge improvements and developments of new overlying protocols.
We are not there yet with bitcoin. But we *will* be. That’s the whole point.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:44:10
Except it is true. AOL, Compuserve, etc, even dial up ISPs made all the TCP/IP underlying technology transparent to the user. 
So, saying 1995 internet is the same thing as bitcoin today is inaccurate. Bitcoin today is more akin to Internet of 1980’s.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:17:13
I don’t think they were using the analogy to compare the boom of the dotcom stocks. It was a technology analogy, basically comparing today’s bitcoin to the internet of the 1970’s. You had to know what you were doing back then if you were playing around with the internet. Today, or even back in the 90’s, the technology was made fairly transparent to the user.
@_date: 2016-10-18 04:06:22
How do I get one of those? I had just used this before:  Is that adequate?
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:21:01
Can you elaborate on that for me? Why couldn't that idea just shift to a different cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:40:25
I encrypt mine with GPG using a password with over 300 bits of entropy. Password stays in my 1password vault. GPG encrypted file stays in a Truecrypt encrypted disk image that I store in Dropbox. The disk image is encrypted with a relatively easy password that I just remember.

If the discs don't read properly for any reason, ddrescue is a great tool for recovering data.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:51:02
So you're saying I'd be just as well of putting the seed in my 1password vault un-encrypted?
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:39:15
We are not at mass adoption yet. Way more people were using the internet in the 90’s than use crypto today. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:35:11
Damn.. good points. I'll have to reconsider where I store this stuff.
