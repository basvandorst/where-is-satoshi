Today is the 5th day since they have received my money order, but my account has still not been credited. I spoke to them earlier and they say they are "looking into it". lol

I'm pretty sure they do already have it though, it was marked as delivered. If they didn't receive it then the mailman may have stolen it (which I find very unlikely), or someone swiped it from their box. If that's the case then its their fault for not having a more secure mailbox.
In their response to my ticket they suggested I might not be sure if I sent them ~$900. "*If you think you sent the MO for $890 in last week...*" How would I not know? I gave them the USPS tracking number and the serial number for the money order, but they are suggesting I'm not quite sure about it? What the f***?
They have held my money like this before, but last time acknowledged receiving my money order. It still took them a week to credit me, after saying "tomorrow you will get your credit for sure," multiple times. Maybe they are making more money by holding it somehow, I'm not sure.

The image you see is sender's copy. The actual Money order itself was filled out "To: Bulbul Investments LLC, From: *My real name*"

I'm not sure what you mean by 'Hobby site', but maybe you're right. Maybe I am overreacting, or perhaps something happened out of their control, but $890 is a lot of money. Even though I could sustain the loss it is very important to me...
If they find my money order, or if I recover the funds I will definitely update, and apologize to Campbx.

Yeah I definitely will if they don't credit my account eventually. The lady at the post office said that I wouldn't be able to trace until 30 days (from purchase?).
