Yeah its not free but it's orders of magnitude cheaper than the environmental effects of burning coal for electricity. Also what about solar reflectors and molten salt systems. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:09:13
Yes they can. This article completely ignores solar and the limited supply of bitcoins. It assumes that we'll always depend on fossil fuels. However the price of solar keeps dropping so this is a non issue. 
My keks would be mighty if regulation came from environmental worries. No one bats an eye when they turn on a light drive a car, take the train consume massive amounts of beef and pig products. It is a necessity in our minds, a necessary evil.

@_date: 2017-12-15 20:21:12
Right, so they don't want any confusion on the name. Personally I think bcash or bit cash or what ever you want to call it doesn't matter. Its a handy abbreviation same as Bcore. The name is the name. People who want to know will find out on their own. Those who need to know, know already. Thank you for clearing up when "Core" became a thing and providing sources. My thoughts on the situation were incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:25:12
Bcash doesn't pretend, its a computer network not a person. Some people who use bcash like to say it is bitcoin. This isn't a real argument and is bait for Bcore holders. However there are plain differences and similarities that cannot be argued, they are in the codebase. 
Your example would require blocks to be well above 1gb. 1000x the current Bcore blocksize. Also it doesnt take into account technologies that could be invented before we reach 5 or 10gb blocks, pruning comes to mind.

Ah no. He doesn't offer to teach them he says "Make your own nets." Apple doesn't offer to teach people how to capitalize on economies of scale through partnerships with governments offering low-skilled labor, thats their bread and butter. Same here, the man is incentivized to hide his actual risk and let people perceive what they think that is for maximum profit. 
The comic is assuming that it would take the same amount of time for the two people to make the nets as it did the first guy. This is false, copying is what we have evolved to do. Explain to me why it wouldn't take a shorter amount of time for these two folks to craft their own nets? The problem is Guy A assumes that because he has suffered for his capital, everyone else deserves to suffer for it as well, he assumes his folks did nothing.
Your second point doesn't make much sense. Why would they burn the nets seeing what they can do? Why didn't China completely ban the exchange of currency? Why aren't initiatives like the Mondragon corporation subject to more destruction rather then production. Their very core of their philosophy is socialist. Also the no true Scotsman fallacy.

If China and the USA engage in a trade they both agree to, how is anyone exploitative/exploited? 
The comic works because it displays the workings of the system on a small scale but once we scale exponentially the problems tend to run out of control. The people who make my shirt and shoes and cellphone don't really have a choice. Its work or die right? And beggars sure can't be choosers in a competitive economy.

@_date: 2018-09-25 13:49:54
Also its strange that you and the other person I'm debating this with never address some very specific points I make. The wage gap widening, admitting the system selects for folks with more selfish tendencies, leading to massive inefficiencies. That fact that exploitation is a natural part of capitalism..these are things you should revel in but you don't jump to defend them why? I'm also really enjoying that you enjoy my slang friend are you also from PA?
@_date: 2018-09-24 20:52:27
You only have to be a "slave-teacher" to one person, and then they can teach the next if ones level of impatience and selfishness is sufficient. 


Right, we have a perfect world now free from persecution, harm and malicious intent no reason to progress any further. Why should we innovate anymore? We can make profits indefinitely through persuasive marketing, and planned obsolescence right now. 
What is the point I ask then of further progress?


What makes it inefficient? Your beliefs?


What government supports the Mondragon? 


Yet we are mired by them. Mega-corporations are the natural finish-line for capitalism. Also what is wrong with them? They are simply in the pursuit of gaining capital for their shareholders, they are doing that. This all seems kosher under my understanding of the economic system. 
In this case you seem like the guys asking to borrow the net. I.e "Mega-corportations are bad because I don't get any of the benefits!" Do they owe you those benefits?


I doubt that and I think you are confusing Capitalism with free trade. They are related but separate things. 


That's a real headscratcher there. It just seems to me like an easier way to provide capital to entrepreneurs who need loans. This capital excess capital grows the economy. At least that's how the comic explained it.  


All of the worse things in the world have come from wanting the self to be happy. All the good things in the world have come from wanting everyone to be happy. 


You are incorrect.  


Me ( If I took the bait ): Actually there are plenty of examples of benevolent socialist thinkers/regimes


Furthermore I think you are again confusing socialism "a range of economic and social systems characterized by social ownership and workers' self-management of the means of production as well as the political theories and movements associated with them." 
and Communism "The philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state."

@_date: 2018-09-23 23:04:10
Where do you draw your happiness? How can you be happy if no one has ever existed but you? I can't speak for you specifically but the majority of my happiness comes from something  or someone other than me. The people who make my booze, my television shows my books, the artists who inspired me to create, my parents who showed me how to live. 
I argue that people are exploited because there is a Cascade kind of effect if his friends don't copy him then someone eventually will. Ergo the world we perceive everyday. 
"How can you argue anyone is exploited when this is the most peaceful and profitable time in history?" Is that what you're saying? or are you strictly keeping to the confines of the analogy? There is exploitation because our heroes 30 fish a day could be reached without loans or interest. 
He is living at the expensive of his friends. It's not so bad if it's half a fish a day, that's a small fee sounds good, but in real life that small fee has become grossly inflated to the point where slavery has been normalized. I don't see a reality where the system in the comic produces another outcome. Just as surely the result would be the same if someone tried to implement Stalin's polices. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:38:40

Good hypothesis. Guess we can only see what happens in the next months.
@_date: 2018-09-24 11:06:14
You're right I didn't say that either. I'm illustrating a point. There is no reality where just you exist. Only the reality of others. When our hero says "my sacrifice", "my risk" he imagines these things belonging to him, he imagines the world where there is him and the things he creates. His friends are auxiliary to that. This is backward. He needs the island, he needs the materials, he needs the sea, the fish, he needs to see his friends catch one fish a day, the sun, to talk to people, safety, shelter. All of these things are in the creation of the net. Take away one and the net cannot exist
So what part of it is "his" sacrifice and "his" risk if without even one of those things our hero does not create the net. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 00:13:06
False equivalence. People who lived in pre-capitalistic societies ( that is societies not concerned with the accumulation of a surplus. ) Only worked a 30-40 hour work week, were stronger and healthier than their farming breathen and were subject to less pestilence.

@_date: 2018-09-24 11:00:51
It was a mistake because our hero doesn't want 30 fish a day. He wants to never work for the rest of his life, regardless of what that means for everyone else who exists with him on the island. Its a mental philosophy that only envisions the effects of ones actions on oneself. This is fundamentally divorced from reality. Ergo, the world we perceive today. ( Ie. The famous "They got theirs, I'm gunna get mine"/"I got mine, fuck them." )
No one can force happiness on you it is just a fundamental fact of reality no you cannot be happy, or create an easy life for yourself without the massive influence of others. What is missing in the comic is assigning the antagonists their true value.   
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:37:31
We're going to end up arguing semantics soon, getting p granular. I like calling Man A our hero though so i'll do that from now on. Could I rephrase my "he doesn't offer to teach them" to a "why would he teach him." He gets more fish exploiting them. If he could figure out interest means double the fish I sure he could do the math and calculate the 1.5x profit for teaching the antagonists for free. Bad common sense dictates that more is better than less especially if we're talking about food.
You see our Hero had to put in the risk and sacrifice first. He didn't know if his idea would work, and he was afraid, but idea did work and people want to use what he worked so hard for; What he has suffered so long for. Why do they just get to have that for free? He doesn't feel they are entitled to capital. Thus. "Make your own nets"/"Get your own fish" make your own capital. All of this behavior is reactionary and our hero is not seeing much beyond his nose. Afterall, his ideas in some rudimentary way lead us to today don't they?
I'm trying to keep my criticisms to the simple way the comic portrays the economic system. We can agree that this analogy does not fit 1:1 with real life right? It is a simplified to illustrate a point. Now you might be saying I brought up Mondragon and Apple but these were responses to when you said "socalists only try to down anyone trying to do good"
So the Mondragon, a company that employs 74,000 people, and makes billions of dollars a year, and definitely didn't collapse in 2013 is trying to down anyone doing good. And Apple a capitalistic company who by your own example relies on government monopoly, and threatens their workers or at least allows the practice is a hallmark of how capitalism is working as intended? :thinking: 
Now to address all your other points.
Is there no theft under capitalism? Nothing to with if I advocated for theft. But does it exist and is it pervasive? 
Is there no murder under capitalism? Nothing to do with if I advocated for murder. But does it exist and is it pervasive?
Are certain types of murder and theft acceptable to you?
Who do you mean by "us" when you say "warning us that you..."
Do you think communism and socialism are the same things?
What do you think human nature was like for the 200,000 or so years before we invented capitalism and fractional reserve banking? In my imagination you don't think it was very nice. 
Do you think that capitalism is a fair, forgiving system or makes the world that way? It was my understanding that capitalism had its basis in competition.
Ps. You really did do a no true Scotsman by proclaiming what a true socialist would do. Its a logical fallacy. Take responsibility for your words. I know I am. It would be smarter to attack me on the basis that the Mondragon is a corporation made elusively for the pursuit of profits and not the pursuit of human well being. Missed opportunity.  
PSS. Obligatory, *bruh* 
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:56:30
Boul fucked up when his homies asked him to borrow the net. I believe his mistake was assuming that the happiness of his cohorts was not his own happiness or his own value, this is the fundamental failing of capitalism and why it only works on paper. It is not a far stretch to assume that he could have just taught them how to make nets ( that way he is not giving up any of his perceived "sacrifice" and instead of 2 fish, they all would have would have 6 fish/day ( against 8 with the interest plan ) but the key is that there is no exploitation this way, only abundance, though less than with the extra steps of financial slavery.
Also the mistake of the comic is assuming that his homies wouldn't just kill and take the net from him ( an easier job with no serious repercussions ). This is a very informative comic though. Thank you for posting it, I had not seen it before.
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:34:55
This doesn't surprise me. I also enjoy my job and profits from it. May I rephrase your statement as "I derive a large part of my happiness from people giving me money that other people have given to others."
 You are still saying I derive my happiness primarily from others. 
In regards to my comment about the small fee, I'm speaking of the cost of living going up and wages not rising with it. Are you not aware of slave labor practices in places like Dubai, China, and the US?

No one decided this. Its just efficiency. In the tribe when the warrior makes the spear does he then teach the entire younger generation to make spears by himself. No, the wife has seen the making of spears, the eldest son has seen the making of spears, the uncle the cousin, the non-familial and so forth. Don't be coy, I'm not trying to be that way, and I'm sorry if I came off that way. 
I know now that you are vehemently opposed to socialism. But when did I ever advocate it? Like our hero your mind is clouded by black and white, this or that. My sacrifice and other's laziness. The world is not dualities. You've been arguing against a socialist the entire time but that is not what I am. I simply wanted to highlight the gross inefficiency and often backwards thinking of the economic system. 
Also really. The definitions of the words hurt your feelings that badly? To the point where you won't even copy and paste a binary representation of them. I can't even fathom what other aspects of reality must be like for you. The world needs stronger willed people than that. 
Could you throw me some sources on capitalism existing for 3.5 million years. Seriously, it would be a very very interesting read. 


No true scotsman to the letter. Its almost as if you copy pasted the example from wikipedia itself. Socialist are not just what you say they are, the same as capitalists aren't. Your anecdotes are just anecdotes. What do you have to say about America toppling democratic governments in south america ( espousing the tools of domination ), or the opium wars in China. The subjugation of India, the trail of tears, the rape of Nanking. 
Claiming to be good. 


Doesn't make one good if you espouse the tools of domination. 
If they are both systems of human slavery and economic destruction then why do slavery and economic destruction exist under Capitalism? Is it not the antithesis to this things? 
I will read the comic again and try to glean a better understanding of its message. Thank you.

How is it technical ignorance, we're in the process of testing solutions to a problem. Science isn't "everyone else is doing it" science is let's see what works. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:40:27
Saying bcash instead of bch doesn't make any sense. Come on you didn't see that coming?
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:37:30
So much for permissionless eh?
@_date: 2018-05-31 02:16:39
Your ignorance is showing.
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:57:49
No one worth listening to said btc had to pick a different name. Bad anology. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:35:13
Replace Chinese with Americans and it's accurate haha
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:11:24
Let the banks fail.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:22:28
Millions of Americans still need new banking solutions. You're on a crypto currency forum. QE only slowed down the inevitable, a complete restructuring of our economic system. 2008 was a bump in the road compared to what is coming. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 01:46:50
If you like saying bcash because you think it makes people upset just say so. Nothing wrong with that. I'm not judging.
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:09:42
We got a badass here ��
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:20:38
 im still on your mind?��
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:40:56
Everything that isn't BTC is a shitcoin? Is BTC included?
@_date: 2018-06-01 01:42:40
I didn't use ad hominem in my previous posts. You are ignorant of the fact that bcash is open source node software that it is not interchangeable with bch. You got bad arguments dawg I'm sry.
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:21:29
So, how is this a scam?
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:12:14
So we're in agreement then. Bcore is interchangeable with btc. It's just a short hand way of saying it. :)
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:49:01
If that's the opinion youve arrived at then i won't try to dissuade you. A man should be allowed to enjoy himself.
@_date: 2018-06-01 15:40:59
Alright have fun in imaginary land. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:41:33
I never said bitcoin cash was bitcoin. :/ So....come again?

@_date: 2018-06-04 22:36:01
Aw it's upset. All I'm saying that if saying bcash makes you feel good who am I really to tell you to stop. Kids will be kids. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:11:13
Sounds plausible. I'd do it if I had alot of hashpower on a chain with limited space. More money for me.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:14:49
Check BCHs mempool.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:04:42
Talking sense? Burn the witch!
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:42:47
There is no attack. This is a feature, its the way things are supposed to be. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:24:47
Its not bullshit. Its a subreddit rule. Talk about alts elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:51:45
Its stuck because hash power is low and volume is high. Nothing wrong with that, the fee market is healthy and I believe it should take time to move digital gold. This makes sense. No one should care about high fees and slow confirms. Only people trying to buy coffee with gold.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:00:26
It's against the rules. Duh.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:09:31
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:07:28
Competition is healthy. Core just needs to attract them back. Better features, faster confirmation times I dunno they'll think of something.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:15:09
Do you like not like south Koreans or something?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:04:55
This is sad. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:47:37
This is just the way the protocol works. Just plan for the wait next time. If you want fast tx use another crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:14:32
If the POW changes bitcoin is no longer Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:29:24
Well are you part of the forum to change minds or are you part of the forum to discuss bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:28:25
Altcoin discussion is not allowed here. Take your fud somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:43:59
The irony.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:32:42
Altcoins have nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:34:08
No one cares about cheap txs. The market has spoken on that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:49:54
Blockchains cannot spam each other. Furthermore there is no way for any of us to know beyond a shadow of a doubt who is moving money and for what reasons. Moving money is not an attack. This is classic fear uncertainty and doubt.
Do not infect newbies and instead educate them on the technical aspects of the situation. This way they can better decide what to do with their money. Encourage user agency.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:20:35
I bought my initial btc with $400 worth of Steem at $2500. Haven't converted any fiat yet
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:26:15
Just in time to regret it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:22:52
Yes the meteoric rise was a bit frightening.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:35:47
This is what a healthy fee market looks like. It should take time to move gold. This is good.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:36:03
The similarities out weigh the differences.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:35:25
That dead cats bounce.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:55:36
They aren't confused because they are clearly defined. Same as what you're alluding to. People aren't dumb. You don't need to think for them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:46:51
Lol there are like five countries that use the word dollar in their currency. Some even copy the symbol.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:32:23
There is no definitive bitcoin brand. Bitcoin is the name of a computer protocol. Since both of the forks implement the same protocol they share what ever "brand" you think exists. This always seems like trying to impose old world rules on new world tech, it seems wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:44:46
"Let's keep saying attack(lie) to upset the other side" 
This bait is most unbecoming. Just sit on your hands and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:29:18
Consequence of a healthy fee market. I don't see anything wrong with this. It takes time to move gold.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:19:48
So Bitcoin cash doesn't follow specifications detailed in the whitepaper? That seems to be what is implied. It is a bitcoin wallet because bch is a implementation of a specific computer protocol called bitcoin. And yes newbies should read. Read alot. User agency should be encouraged. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:13:36
Price isn't the most important thing. And Its not the alt its the miners. Don't like the miners? Change POW.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:35
Talking about altcoins is against the rules. Please refrain.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:33:40
Take it to some other crypto subreddit and dont forget to read the rules.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:05:49
Yes, yes it is.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:19:26
Well it might be more correct to say that it wouldnt use the same protocol as the whitepaper describes. It would be just a cryptocurrency that borrows features from it. 
Nothing wrong with that. Just call it something else. Why not?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:08:43
Mods must be sleeping.

@_date: 2017-11-10 13:21:48
Then you're in an echo chamber. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:22:38
Talk about altcoins somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:45:45
Wow. Be friendly to newbies. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:13:21
You guys just can't help but talk about altcoins. Take it somewhere else. Bitcoin doesn't need this fud.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:41:53
They are implementations of the same protocol but altcoin discussion is not allowed here.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:43:25
Who needs their small txs on a blockchain? Citizens of of an efficient government could benefit greatly. Think taxes. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:03:57
Its actually doing quite well. Doesn't strike me as failed .
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:54:29
People moving their money is an attack. :rolleyes:

Altcoins have nothing to do with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:29:30
Nah. I know people who hold both  and are buying both. I know those who are exchanging one for the other. I when my associates don't subscribe to just one mode of thinking
Edit. I hold both
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:06:15
Not allowed to make posts about alts. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:54:27
Hashrate doesn't belong to a specific chain. Miners are free agents. If you don't like, advocate for a POW change.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:55:44
Its not a "fake." Just a different implementation of the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:06:02
Man this would be great. Hadn't crossed my mind.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:22:45
Btc folks really want bch to fail exactly where it did. Money badger don't care 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:03:37
The irony.

1/4 to 1/3 of roger vers retweets are from people. That's basically what you just said.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:07:48
Im excited to see how this plays out.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:54:53
Its not an offspring. Its an altcoin. No one is stealing hashpower. That would require the miners to have some sort of exclusive agreement with Core. Miners are free agents, and they own their own hardware. Hashpower cannot be stolen from a chain because it was never owned by the chain.
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:10:49
Boycotts don't work boys. We're talking about money. No one cares about your morals. This is embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:27:31
Not my authority. People seem to like him here though. So you're whining because the fork has value and use case. Both forks would be worth nothing if they weren't useful. End of story. Maybe the free market isn't for you bud sell your coins. 
PS muh infinite supply though infinite forks. Be real with me, you know that would never work. Its a nonstarter
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:09:40

I need your definition of valid. Because mine is simply working as intended.
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:34:55
Unless you want to talk about ((that)) "altcoin" Then its fine. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:47:51
The split(s) did not increase the supply of Btc. Seems like thats what you're saying. 
I'm sorry but you're not making very much sense. Like consensus determines the valid chain on the individual networks. BCH and BTC are different networks. Its like you're just saying random bitcoin facts.
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:05:08
We all know that's not the way it works. More over, where are these noobs with "I thought I was buying Bitcoin but I bought this green thing." You're not throwing thousands at a digital asset without knowing what it is, unless youre a complete loon in which case you got just desserts. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:07:47
Misery loves company. So the community gets together to do something negative instead of positive.

Everythings a conspiracy.
