No, they only have intrinsic value, because we believe they have value. Just like we believe in the idea of ownership i.e. we trust that people will enforce it.


I understand, and I'm trying to say to you that everything is 100% risk and that everything underlying this is the notion of trust that we take for granted. 
So in essence, they aren't really that different. Do I agree with you that material possession is so basic that understanding and trust in it is harder to shake than trust in Bitcoin? Absolutely. However, you risk in business or bitcoin can be similar depending on what is on the books. If there are a lot of losses and liabilities, well, all the assets on the book might be liquidated to appease the creditors.
Ultimately, my point is, investment in general carry risk of loss in most situations.

Just like Bitcoin..... or currency, or metal, or gold or....
"Things" have value because you see value in it.... Still that doesn't rule out the fact that a business can have more debt or obtain more debt than it's assets based on intangible assets.

Sometimes there is, and sometimes there isn't. Most of the time the assets are over appreciated anyhow and basing it on the future.


I don't know what 100% risk means, but yes Bitcoin like other forms of investment has risks.

What long term view would that be?

and that is usually worth cents for every dollar and a bunch of liabilities. Point is, a large part of the value of the business is based on trust. Do you trust the business? Do you trust Bitcoin?

I expect that with investing, most of the time can go both ways too. 


Maybe, but at the same time, that is what keeps the bubble growing.

I disagree. You can gamble $5k, not expect your losses to materially affect you, but still think it is a lot.

Worry not about what you lost, but what you have and can get. :)

He probably has/bought more and is filthy rich now.

That is what I'm thinking....
