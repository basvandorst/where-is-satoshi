10% seriously thinking of doubling down tho 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:04:38
I don't know what any of this means I'm just Guna downvotes you because everyone else is

If you're just starting Xmas shopping now you're doing it wrong 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:50:58
Lulz must be new 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:17:45
I did this at 10k and it went down to 8k. You'll be fine 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:29:53
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:22:55
The whole situation stinks. Shit has gotten super scammy recently. Guna hodl but I'm kinda over it 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:14:02
That may be. I doubt it, and if it does it isn't happening any time soon. My coins are just fine in my safe 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:04
You don't. That's their trick. Rip dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:05:11
Wtf is going on here with all the haters? Not usually one for conspiracies but something awfully fishy has been going on the past few days. Anyways here's to holding fellas
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:43:30
Can someone eli5 why this is sketchy to me. Have heard many things about it but don't really get the conspiracy 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:57:10
The more the merrier but if a $600 fluctuation scares you maybe this isn't the game for ya. Shit tanked 2k literally minutes after I bought in. But I held and am now up 70%. 20k by Xmas right? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:16:08
Take and upvote. I agree but am still going to hodl. The only thing I believe bitcoin has going for it at this point is the fact it's the gold standard for crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:22
Just crypto things
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:56:00
Lets not get ahead of ourselves here. 30k by the new year would scare me more than anything 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:27
Only invest what your willing to lose breh. It would sting but life would go on. Gotta play to win Holmes 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:18:03
Coinbase app. You can buy 20 bucks worth if ya want 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:12:53
Bout time. Shit was on a steady decline since I bought in 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:33:00
Soooooo should I buy more now or wait until this happens and drops the price? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:46:30
Yall need to put your shit on a ledger s stop looking at the price for a year or two. I've only been on the game for two weeks and these comments are making me feel like a vet 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:11:13
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:39:36
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:07:28
Yeah whens it Guna happen I wanna buy more and it just keeps going up and up 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:41:24
This is what I did. ~10% of my monies 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:35:51
WOOOOOO 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:45:38
Panic sold my eth right as it hit what I bought it at and now everything is up. If that's what it took I'll take it and you're welcome 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:33
Yeah dude 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:08:17
^my life
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:56:43
Remind me March 14th
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:08:01
I have money in binance that I pretty much just leave as btc and if I see something taking off I buy in and then sell before bed. Has been working out pretty well so far. It's all most likely going to end up in Ripple and trx at some point tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:34:25
Bitcoin cash at 0 -100% on coinbase right now
We won! Fuck you whatever your name is! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:08:25
hey its sunday, and theres a pretty good chance its going to happen
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:11:09
Half now half when you see what happens in a few hours. I can never do that and it always bites me in the ass but that's what you should do 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:34:59
Damn it's fixed 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:56:53
Don't think I'm doing it right 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:59
I wish it was 11.7 I'd Def buy more 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:04:29
Because it's not skyrocketing? I'm honestly happy this ride has slowed down a bit 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:21:05
I think the mania phase just started at 10k and we have a long way to go yet. Hodl. Im honestly considering doubling down on the next dip 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:48:01
I bought in a smaller amount at 13.4, second guessing it the whole time, but just wanted to satisfy my need. Now I wish I bought more 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:39:30
lol 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:07:49
Damn got me 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:57:26
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:04:04
Yeah when's it Guna happen cause I wanna buy more and it just keeps going up and up 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:44:29
Same. The pint will have to wait till after work tho. 
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:56:52
I bought at 10k last time haha
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:51:55
Yeah I'm in for the long haul so I should just stop looking at it. Can't help it tho being a noob 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:44:32
So if my purchase from when it hit 10k is still pending can I cancel it and buy now at 9k? Doubtful since everyone would Prolly do it but it's worth the ask 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:47:15
Figured as much. Oh well so I wait for it to go back up. Only spend what you can lose 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:34:51
Wish I would have waited to buy in. Not worried but buying in at 10.1k and having it drop to 9k hurts a tide bit. Won't matter in a year but it's killing me now 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:05:12
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:19:28
Did this a year ago. My only problem is I'm pretty sure I don't remember how to use it
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:02:56
Soooooo when do I get my lambo? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:17:48
What's something appreciating? Mr magical internet investment advisor? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:10:41
Yep not worrying about petty day trading. As a 30 year old, this is my first major investment. It's locked away on a ledger in my safe. Don't plan on touching it for years
