I won’t
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:39:21
Get one thing straight. I have not and will not sell for less than I bought. I will either be rich, make my money back or lose it all. There is no in between for me.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:30:26
Because it makes sense. It’s immutable, it’s borderless, permission-less and scarce. It makes sense to me and to the community but who is to say that it is going to make sense to the rest of the world. Which mind you actually need to get in even for me to break even.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:07:41
O cool fu lol
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:10:44
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:33:53
I can’t I am addicted to buying and the price falling shortly after.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:40:10
i buy every week. I don't really care what price.
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:44:20
Yeah I am just gonna keep buying I just feel like crying for once since I have started this crypto journey. I have capitulated emotionally. I will never sell at a loss however I’d sooner lose it all fuck that. Idgaf lose it all break even or be rich that’s it for me
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:34:39
see you in 20 years.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:45:20
Because what else is btc pegged to if not fiat? Idk about you but I like to see green not be in the red for 2 fucking years. I wonder how many years it will be for me to see green.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:42:29
fucking bitch saying she doesn't want to talk about crypto.....
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:27:43
I hope you have a permit
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:59:04
You make it sound like BTC has no value. It is money that no one but the owner of the private keys control. That is extremely valuable.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:27:51
this didnt age well LOL
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:15:15
Why do you think it is impossible to regulate? If they put it in a etf let’s say then prices are going to be what the etf says in a regulated environment where pump and dumps can’t happen.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:52:14
I put in $1000 at 15k......
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:33:53

@_date: 2017-12-11 22:48:49
0.06 of bitcoin it really isn't much. I want to invest more but it's so damn high. I know the only one who can make that decision is me but I like to vent by typing on here, so please excuse me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:37:24
I kinda wonder if the powers that be will allow that to happen. If they were to get in bed (which they are) with the government what is to stop them from making this currency illegal? I have been interested in bitcoin since the beginning and I feel like the biggest idiot for not buying then. It really hurts.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:35:27
I recently bought $1000 when bitcoin was at 15k and $1000 litecoin at $165. Do you think i should hold or sell? What would you do?
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:10:28
Thanks but yeah w.e I guess I am gonna lose it all w.e I am not gonna lose anything that I can’t afford to lose but it still hurts
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:59:11
Cvv code is on the back of the debit card
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:11
Yep i bought At 15k w.e im just going to hodl
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:52:42
Says we couldnt find what you are looking for. Does that mean i lost the bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:26:11
i have my bitcoin in mycelium and they want to charge me $54 to withdraw how the fuck can I do this for cheaper?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:05:34
You forgot the /s
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:32:33
I got in at 16k i have no choice but to hodl. I will try to just set it and forget it but i doubt it. I might just have to invest again when and if it drops to like 10k
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:29:54
They did give me one but how do i know that it sent it to my wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:53:38
So how much did you make total?
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:14:19
inside of the lip?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:49:32
You can use your bank account
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:02:42
You are so wrong. The dollar isn’t going away for a very long time. Mark my words. Even with this huge debt you forget why people trust in the dollar in the first place.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:27:28
I can afford to lose every cent I have put into it, I just got frustrated after two years of this. The tech is brilliant. It’s immutable because every transaction that gets put on the chain has to be verified by all the nodes that all have the same ledger. It is scarce because there are 21 million only ever to be mined and a lot are lost so it’s actually less. What I really love is that I can take my wealth with me wherever I go. That is really what makes btc valuable to me. The problem I am seeing is that there is no adoption and I put a big ass chunk of my money almost at the top. It’s frustrating....... thanks for the quiz.
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:28:18
Aye, That be true.
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:55:41
The only etf that really matters is the only one they have yet to deny..... Cboe 
@_date: 2018-08-28 12:21:46
Rofl this is so true it hurts. I well back down we go boys
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:06:35
I diversify. Btc propping me up.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:08:53
I am at 70% losses and haven't sold a 0.0000000000001 of any coin. These people are bitches. It's ok though time is on my side. I figure I will die in like 60 years. Should be enough time to get my money back.
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:18:26
ive been down 5 gs for 3 months I think I can handle it. I was just venting.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:07:44
10k was first purchase in Dec............
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:33:52
The good thing is that most of us are paying attention. That means price will not move, hopefully. We are like 4 months away from bakkt and if etf gets approved there are going to be new millionaires created.
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:59:11
in dec i bought 10k. I bought $100 worth last night. that is not what it says..........
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:35:39
read my original post and comprehend it.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:48:48
Nope I fucked up. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:50:16
Coin base or Gemini 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:10:39
I think it is invest what you are willing to lose. Don't pull out until you have your initial investment back or make a profit. Investing 101
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:40:59
I saw my 10000 dollar investment down to its current at 3.8k I think i will be fine............ just venting. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:21:59
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:34:02
75% here. Not selling
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:20:42
Lol i havent bought anything since i got in in December. I thought oh boy looks like i should buy a lil bit ofnbitcoin this is going up. Bought 100$ at 9586. I kidnyou not 5 mins later it was 9380 or something like that. I am still down from my original investment all around. This blows big time i really hope i am not wrong to think none of this will matter come next year.....
@_date: 2018-08-05 15:49:12
i am very much in the red bout 70% haven't sold and won't sell til I lose it all or gain it back.
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:55:27
what? I bought $100 worth of bitcoin since i bought in december. Do you know how to comprehend what you read?
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:08:03
anyone know what happened to the pizza shop that took the coins? Did they hodl?
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:26:51
You do know that Cboe etf is still on the table. You sound like “hurr durr that’s it guys this is great news now that it failed.” And don’t even realize the biggest ETF has still yet to be decided on. I thought none were going to pass but now I see a big chance for yes on Cboe etf. Why? Because they just killed off the rest of the etf. Why not kill all of them at once? Because, They are thinking yes. 85% sure it will pass.
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:11:05
Sounds great. To think I opened a bitstamp account back in 2011 and never actually did anything. That is my biggest regret to date. I think you're approach is right on the money. Limited supply and is the dominate factor in this market. I just hope those fucking assholes at Bcash don't actually change that. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:03:58
At the moment yes. But I figure in five years that will be different. Why so pissy lol
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:53:14
wow your portfolio must be awesome. Wanna trade I am five k in the red as we speak :D
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:21:14
I mostly just buy and treat it as lost money, One this is for sure though I will NOT sell for less than I got in. This buy in particular really got me though. I am so bad at timing the market lol.
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:17:29


interesting got any links? 
You should care for an ETF though. I mean only if you want the value of btc to go up that is. Bakkt might be the trigger though. 6 months from now we should know what is going to happen bear or bull.
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:55:03
Meh just a blip in the timeline. Let’s see if I am down in five years. That’s when I will become worried.
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:46:33
You are ensured. You need to do some digging that money isn’t lost... 
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:17:38

So smart of you. I do the same thing I bought a 950$ car and will drive it for as long as it lasts. I can afford to drive a brand new 90k car but it is the dumbest move you can do. I am going to be rich af one day and I am not letting a car slow my way to the top. I pay 35$ in insurance a month. Idgaf what people think of me. I am richer than most idiots out there flaunting their debt.

You can just wear a mask. I do t have the picture but I have seen it here on reddit a dude collects the check in a scream mask and is covered head to toe. No idea if the guy is white black etc
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:22:12
I am almost even. I have been buying. I won’t sell for the next 18 years. This is my retirement plan.

wow you must be rich haha
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:36:40
Ever think that he is saying that because he wants them to try? That would be super bullish for btc.....
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:49:50
Wow you are living the dream man.... while I am here with two babies at 30 y/o.......... I regret most things
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:51:33
Think of it as a 401k... you can only deposit. I am going to use mine in 18 years time. Of course this depends if this actually works or not but I am planning on retiring with this. If not oh well I guess I’ll die.
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:39:27

I like this input. Nice.
@_date: 2018-10-02 20:20:12
I see. I believe you will regret it though unfortunately for you. I do think that if you found peace then yes it was probably worth it. I used to go crazy about the numbers. Now I just realize it doesn't matter. That money is going to be a lot higher than my initial come 10 years.
@_date: 2018-10-12 12:04:19
Lol down 80% here
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:47:22
So you are in the green or still red?
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:34:14
Lol it’s like yeahhh when did you get into crypto? Today?
@_date: 2018-10-03 01:23:00
Holy shit you must be happy af thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2019-11-25 22:33:00
I have never sold a single thing I only buy more. Been here since 2017.
@_date: 2019-11-12 00:16:30
yep. I just keep buying. This is probably really dumb but it's what I do buy btc once a week with the occasional huge purchase.... But alas I am still in the red man dec 2017 was such a bad time to get in.
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:13:23
nice. I hope I can see green one day.
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:31:59
And now we back down rofl I hate this shit
@_date: 2018-10-03 11:50:57
do you even work anymore?
@_date: 2019-11-01 00:24:01
I am sober and I been buying since the great fomo of 2017 :( almost in the green :)
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:12:23
This is so true. I have not missed one day on the news and the way markets work on psychology more than anything. I kinda think that this was an investment for me and learning how to make money without working. Hell this exp for me is what drove me to build my second business. It is a blessing in disguise. Glad I saw that. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:14:18
I was thinking the same thing. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:04:45
lol "Epstein's shop"
@_date: 2018-10-17 12:41:51
I think 8020
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:50:33
I bought at 5999
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:33:28
Thats what I am doing either I will be rich or live under a bridge for retirement.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:16:57
I don’t tell anyone what I am doing with my investments
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:24:45
I am planning on buying for the next 18 years and cashing out in 20.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:26:06
Naw I can lose it just don't want to
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:33:36
I just imagine if this shit really goes to 60k by years end I am going to flip the fuck out. and if it doesn't well w/e I didn't bet the house.
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:31:28
I am remember when I used to be a moonboi..word of advice don’t trade on your emotions. I am not even phased by this pump. Beware of fomo....
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:36:27
I don’t accept credit cards for payment unless the client is willing to pay the 3.5%. All my contracts state that. I really want to accept btc but I don’t want the hassle of the taxes.
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:55:43
dude that sounds cool I have to check it out what the F do I have to do? Just google active trader gemini?
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:08:50
haha its true because it became mainstream at 19k so yeah we all want to shoot ourselves because we are still in the red when we could have profited and then bought back in at insanely low prices.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:06:06
i bought 10k worth at 8600.......
@_date: 2019-08-18 03:02:06
WhAt? I am always in the red lol
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:16:25
so true!
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:20:49
What would I get if I put 3000$ in the machine today?
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:42:08
I am still doing it but I always have a little bit of doubt like I will be buying til 0 and nothing comes out of it except being in debt to myself.
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:56:35
i bought the dip got in at 5800 or so
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:07:47
If that is true that fucking sucks
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:14:54
No one can buy any asset without risk LOL
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:40:13
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:25:13
But most likely by that time I won't have to cash out.
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:23:18
What about 1.7?
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:21:16
Maybe but I am just using today's dollar value  to make the point.
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:58:09
you really need to get educated in this space before just blindly throwing your money at garbage like libra........
@_date: 2019-10-02 23:33:05
she is plain looking and looks older than her age.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:51:23
If each btc hits 1 million will you sell yours in full? I find it to hard to believe... everyone would sell while they can. I know at that price I will.
@_date: 2019-10-04 11:47:25
Rofl. I would never buy this Supra....... they fucked up royally
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:47:15

@_date: 2019-08-18 17:54:49
been hearing that for 2 years. I believe it but sometimes I don't. Doesn't stop me from buying every week though.
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:17:12
They can’t fake it
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:32:46
market is indecisive right now. I personally put in a huge long recently. I don't really care because this is my 401k. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-10-17 12:11:35
Anyone think that me buying every week is good? I feel like I just keep losing money. It’s horrible but i am addicted to buying. I need a bull market man...
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:27:31
I think we will get there in my lifetime. Probably in 30 years.
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:50:02
It was proven that it wasnt manipulation it was demand that did the 2017 bullrun. Please stop spreading fud
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:18:20

cool man thanks. I am gonna try that even though I just pretty much went all in recently. ty
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:04:31
You still don’t get it. It is too young but eventually it will top out and stay there my time frame is 20-60 years. These are generational buys at these prices.
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:22:47
ok. Thats not what is happening here. This is ICE we are talking about here. They are not manipulating anything.
@_date: 2019-10-17 11:29:21
That prophecy is not coming bro I like you wish it would but it’s not
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:18:03
I bought 1 btc at 8600 :(
@_date: 2019-10-05 20:55:14
thats facebook coin... I have a feeling you trolling us.
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:31:37

Are you kidding man?? I want this bitch to go to the moon...... My bags are filled with a bunch of thor hammers....
@_date: 2019-10-20 15:24:18
no thanks. Unless they make a simulation of a stick shift version I could never get a tesla. I need to drive the car not have the car drive me. Fuck automatics.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:27:29
play with it then? buy put in a long or a short... or just hodl...
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:11:01
it takes 7-10 days for funds to go through. So what I do is deposit ahead of time so I can always have $100 on my buy day.
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:21:02
This is my first trade so you are wrong about the red. I only started DCA around January 2019. I lump summed in dec 17 for my downfall. Now it is a fucking horrible climb back up.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:08:21
Wow damn you must be rich af..... awesome no work for you!
@_date: 2019-06-15 20:21:46
I use coinbase pro its only a couple cents per $100

dude gemini is 3%
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:16:43
damn that is so awesome. I fucked up in 2018 and didn't buy only started buying arouund feb 2019. I am not longer going to be scared. I am buying $100 a week for the next 20 years.

@_date: 2019-06-15 16:46:15
WOW congrats!!!!! I still have a ways to go but I am pamping away every week emotionless! Just pushing in those bills for sats!
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:32:40
Congrats! I hope we both make it. I luckily have no worries about money in the sense of paying my bills. I am 30 been with the same woman for 11 years and we have 2 kids together. I own and operate my own business and I am truly ok. I want more. That is my only complaint. I want to travel the world and not have to worry about money. I guess I am selfish, but so be it this life is one. I want to do w/e the fuck I want and have no consequences period. God speed.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:16:36
show me.
@_date: 2019-10-20 17:26:49
I am what is your point? I have only EVER bought manual cars and trucks.......
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:03:26
Because I got in dec 2017
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:56:26
we are going back down. nothing to see here....
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:30:59
Well my plan is to sell in 20 years. So I don't think it really matters. I don't have time to trade like that.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:27:40
Lump sum investing got me into trouble before and dca is helping me get out of the red.
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:02:21
Can you imagine being in the green again?
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:25:46
Rofl as soon as I typed this I checked and unfortunately I was right
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:23:14
i based my whole crypto career on this
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:37:20
tell that to my wallet that is 2k in the red. All I have done is DCA to try to get even........ I got in dec2017
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:56:37
Oh I have that feeling alot of the time. Seriously fiat just doesn't make sense.... I wonder if it will last though because I mean it can if everyone believes hard enough.
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:24:08
Hopefully man!
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:37:39
I put my coins in my ledger after I buy.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:16:22
My dumb brain. In all seriousness though I don't really know if I am gonna do it. I am however putting 10k in my gdax account right now. Gonna hopefully see a fat ass 50% dip and pamp it!
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:37:36
I don't have time for that. I think my strategy of buying every week for the next 20 years will work out fine. Maybe.
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:03:57
due time****  I think***
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:30:57
I keep buying though but let me tell you it is super hard
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:58:08
I wonder if the seller then sold the btc or held on to it
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:30:58
yup, i fucked up. just gonna keep buying weekly.
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:00:24
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:00:08
Lump buying is what got me screwed in 2017. I think it really depends on what price is and people cannot predict the future. Also ANYTHING you invest in is a pure 100% gamble. It may seem like it is going to work even with years of research but it will always be a gamble maybe not 100% but it isn't a fact.
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:11:57
i am down 2k since 2017................ at one point i was down 6k............hodl..............
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:59:53
No problem ask me anything. What I do is deposit 10 days ahead of time so I can have $100 in there ready to buy at all weekly intervals. So I basically have $200 in there at all times and buy on a specific day of the week.
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:26:05
i been buying $100 a week btc strictly without fail and without care of price since jan 2019. I just kinda want 20 years to just pass so I can be well off.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:07:24
So you are rich?
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:06:59
I am down 2k since 2017 so don't worry you never lose until you sell...... Maybe I'll be holding forever w/e
@_date: 2019-02-01 22:59:07
ROGER ROGER
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:31:59
I am not claiming anything. I am gambling. I believe that this is going to be something of value. Could I be wrong and lose it all? Yes, I am willing to take the risk. I am not putting in more than I can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:16:33
I think!
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:11:51
Have you been dollar cost averaging?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:31:46
Thanks for trying to talk sense into my dumb decisions though, You are kind.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:34:58
Been doing it, I love and hate you're certainty though to be quite honest. I am literally 50/50 but I don't allow it to deter me. $100 a week for 20 years. That is my goal and I WILL DO IT. Even if I lose it all. Not very smart nor very stupid.
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:24:43
I am expecting a pullback but idk... everything is looking different 
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:20:29
umm think about it.... it is totally possible.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:30:41
welp i sold at a $9 loss. This is my first time actually losing money in stocks/crypto. Fuck it I am down 2k since 2017 I don't want to be in the red anymore. I am gonna buy the huge dip inc soon.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:30:05
where are you getting your info from?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:01:15
I just took out 10k from an account and am planning to buy in..... and keep DCA...... I think I am going nuts....  I am still 40% down.............
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:58:32
hope we are right! I am just gonna keep buying everyweek emotionless.
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:59:32
It's been debunked by many. DCA is a solid investment strat.
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:53:42
I want orange coin to go up already and I am frustrated
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:04:41
It is truly amazing how horribly bored the human mind becomes. We are anything but complacent. Every single day I am looking for ways to not have to work and be rich. I am a slave to the idea of wealth. I am actually opening another business this week and hope that it isn’t a total failure as my last business venture. Here’s to many fruitful years bro.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:23:09
I am 40% down. I have been DCA and I just want more btc........ I feel like I am a fool but. This isn't all my money or anything. If I lose this 20k I'll be fine. If I lose this opportunity, I will regret it for the rest of my life. Not saying that the time is now just saying that I need to be ready.
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:19:45
no been DCA since dec.....
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:57:51
So basically you are calling me retarded. That is fine. I am retarded.
@_date: 2019-12-14 15:50:11
Lol look how many people think you are an idiot. Rofl
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:11:37
So.... I feel like $5 out of $1000 is pretty negligible. Would I be better off buying somewhere else with even better rates? Because gemini takes out $3 out of $100 which to me is unacceptable.
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:16:02
how is it .5%?????? on coinbase pro????? it's 0.005% for everyone else......
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:17:44
Yeah. I feel you. I have been DCA since dec 18.... man I wish I wouldve bought all the way down. Now my plan is keep DCA for 20 years every week. See you on the other side!
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:29:28
I have more btc than anything but you should know that eth is fucking awesome.... there are literally terabytes on eth I suggest you DYOR
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:37:40
I love btc as  much as the next hodler but..... when this shit goes parabolic get ready for $50 transaction fees again.........
@_date: 2019-12-21 15:31:01
Coinbase pro charges .0035%
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:09:25
i am down 10k
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:07:24
Thats the only downside to it for me it is waiting for it to clear. I always just keep something in there though to buy dips.
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:35:10
LOL we are probably going back down. I am ain't buying it. I got buys at 5200..... I been buying all the time so don't hate  on me please. I just don't want to buy now cuz I am pretty sure it is going down.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:21:09
I am still down 2grand from 2017...........
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:43:51
what? i didnt throw in the towel lol. I bought at 11.4k to sell at 12.1k because the trend was doing that. I guess I got in to late. I still have alllllll of my btc and shitcoins that i have been accumulating. It was just the $200 i threw in today that I sold. But i am going to buy the pullback
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:28:33
As a contractor myself with a utility truck like that in front of my house. You people have no idea how much money we make........ Trust me trades people who are OWNERS make ALOT of money.......
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:53:20
I want orange coin to go up already and I am frustrated
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:11:40
What you do is take your coins to the bank. Get dollars and go to coin star and buy btc. Ez PZ
@_date: 2019-12-06 12:52:06
Lol that’s why this guys friend probably has clients that are extremely rich.... just like me I don’t work for the average joe..... that’s why I make the big bucks ;)
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:10:32
Dude you are looking at workers wages.... i.e what the electrician pays his workers... not what the company makes man. I make on average net 500 a for 4 hours of work. On a good day 6 hours of work I can make 3 grand.... you gotta step outside the box a little though and be a true master. I fix the cheap shit work people think they are getting a deal on.....
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:42:40

@_date: 2019-12-01 14:34:23
THANKS SO MUCH!

Thanks.. I am actually listening to the video you uploaded... I am frustrated for this guy.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:23:09

Got in with 6.5k now sitting on 1.8k.... I haven’t sold a single satoshi... I am buying more next week.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:45:33
As it turns out that is the case! On the app on the phone it doesn't say anything. I just logged on my pc and it says that it is on hold. What I don't understand is why.... I bought btc on the 22 of december. I don't understand why...
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:14:52
I am willing to bet against that 5k prediction. It is goi g to stay the same or drop
@_date: 2019-01-16 18:27:06
Rofl I really don’t see shit happening for the next 10 years
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:23:14
went from $6500 to $1800 ROFL
@_date: 2019-01-25 01:27:34
Could be man , Could be.
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:16:02
I just know I lost it all but won’t sell. I am numb
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:16:49
i really hope so because 2morrow who knows if i will be able to get it out.........
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:48:24
no but its going to dump ALOT if it get denied. I will bet on  it.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:51:52
T was supposed to launch 2 days ago..................
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:08:46
yeah but that is everyone. I have not paid 1 cent to a financial institution. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:59:08
Google high interest savings account. I also have a 2.2% interest savings..... there are some more risky ones at 5%+
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:57:47
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:57:44
I have paid $0 to banks in my life. I am frugal and fiscally responsible. I also have a savings with 2.2% interest....
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:07:38
It's not going anywhere but down if the etf gets denied in feb.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:55:36
Yeah I am just going to slowly keep cost averaging down. When It goes to the moon I am going to cash it out though even if it takes 20 years I am not going to let it profit taking pass me by this time.
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:38:27

@_date: 2019-01-16 22:46:03
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:25:44
bro this is not going to happen in 2025 maybe 2050
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:21:40
Anything above $1
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:10:31
@_date: 2018-07-05 13:03:15
I love crypto but this has never been a problem for me. I have free checkin and savings accounts. I have never been charged by my banks for anything at all. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:41:54
But then what is the FDIC for?
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:01:54
yes. I can transfer between accounts for free and send payments out for free. My banks really don't make 1cent off me. I think they make money off people who are irresponsible like with overdraft fees and such.  
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:07:30
0% chance? I got in in December and know that is total bullshit.....
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:04:19
Why not both?
@_date: 2019-09-05 12:00:37
That’s what I do
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:38:37
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:47:26
where do you see that info?
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:08:35
HMM that is strange. I would change banks :P also I just remembered my banks have made money off of me. I have used a non bank ATM and they charge 2$ or so for non bank atm withdraws. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:48:25
i have been waiting for this move for months... I am sure this is going to end poorly for me in the short term but w.e i am holding for 20 years so its all goodz
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:59:45
Its a Ponzi scheme. Yep �� he knows a lot.     /s....... like it’s decentralized lol
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:02:38
Umm do consider we live on a planet called earth? Because it sounds like you dont
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:19:54
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:19:45
ermm yeah history shows us that markets can tank....like the great depression.... I am just saying that nothing is impossible you cannot rule out that this thing can blow. Why the hell do you think the motto is don't invest more than you are able to lose?
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:48:47
Honesty, This does NOT look good for the industry.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:07:49
rofl I will have the last laugh in 20 or so years.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:16:39
damn i dont remember this in the series... whjere is this?
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:17:17
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:04:46
If it passes then we would all lose.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:34:49
I signed up but it is going to be more expensive if I am understanding their fees correctly. It's minimum $7.xx for a wire transfer. So unless I am going to deposit $10000 it isn't worth it. If my quick mathz are correct.
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:32:51
I have everything on my ledger. Where do you buy btc that is less than 3%? I don’t use robinhood as I hold for long term.
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:56:20
Too early best hold til 2022 or so
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:15:28
THANKS I will sign up with them
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:33:03
I buy at gemini, the fees for $100 is 2.99. Transfer to wallet is in the % of a cent.
Edit: I don't play the short game. I am in this for the long haul. 20 years is my projection for distributions. I just hope I don't lose due to regulation/quantum computing. It's a extremely risky bet. At the end of the day I am not investing more than I can afford to lose. I am however doubling down on my IRA and living the most meager life possible to come out on top in 20 years time. This is all a sacrifice, That in my mind is going to be worth it. I hope I am not wrong. I will laugh all the way to the bank or to the grave however. This is true freedom.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:14:17
So true
@_date: 2019-05-30 00:21:30
heh you just want to accumulate as much as possible. I don't mind this going on for a couple years..... I need to  stack as many sats as possible.
@_date: 2018-12-24 04:00:00

“I could’ve bought at $3300”
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:26:38
of course grayscale is going to say that. I am very invested in btc/crypto, But I HATE how they are bashing gold.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:49:14

I’m waiting for Chinese New Year
@_date: 2019-05-24 12:13:41
so did anyone actually buy with btc???? I am genuinely interested.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:11:26
i bought on 12/16/2017. I WILL NOT SELL FOR LESS THAN I PAID
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:37:32
I do $100 a week religiously
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:48:53
I am to scared to buy now it drops all the time but I bought anyways
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:13:36
Thank you for this. I really need a vacation LOL
