ripple might be a scam. be careful!

And when I want to convert it back to dollars which site would be best to sell them at?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:03:18
yep  works fine.
i'm gonna go to sleep and see if the problem resolves itself. if not i'll try finding a VPN to use in the meantime. i'll also try to access it from my other internet connection and my cell phone.
thanks for the help!

yesterday mtgox, dwolla, and blockchain weren't working for me from here in china. but as of about 7 hours ago they're working now.

Not always. Couple months ago I ordered at 120 I got it one week later at 240.

yeah a woman named GuoMeiMei took a lot from Red Cross and bought herself a new car and some other shit and posted it online. She never got punished for it either.

coinbase took a week. wasn't worth it.
bitfloor i sold within an hour. haven't tried buying from them yet, but i deposited coins and cash into them fairly fast. i was able to do an online transaction through my bofa account.

Prolly thinking of Japanese money, "won" I think.

wow crazy

I deposited money from my bank account into Dwolla about 6 days ago so I'm waiting for it to go through. It's estimated it'll process tomorrow sometime. So I have no idea yet, but so far you're gonna have to wait for it.
If you're in the US I suggest using a Bank of America BITFLOOR deposit as I heard it's fairly fast.
And if you have bofa already you can make an online deposit into bitfloor's account.

I put in an order several days ago and they took my money from dwolla but the order had a problem and it hasn't processed and i still haven't heard from them.

a few days ago during the crash mtgox, dwolla, and a few other bitcoin sites were blocked here in china. no idea why..
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:51:34
im buying because its decently cheap now
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:16:03
I don't have a good idea on them but be sure to factor in electricity costs.
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:15:30
they would most likely complete orders very slowly.
maybe doing something like making you wait a week or so until your order completes.
@_date: 2013-04-05 05:47:47
I heard that you can do it through BOFA's online banking also. Just transfer the cash to the account.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:44:33
yeah i suppose so. i don't know why i got downvoted. just throwing out my experience.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:24:37
how does google artificially inflate their stock? he's right. these are bots manipulating the prices.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:58:32
Dear BITINSTANT, I've also had some recent problems. First time using your service and a few hours later it says "Order Failed". I made this order several days ago and I'm still waiting for an email and for something to happen.
