Think that over from another point of view. Money or crypto in the hands of an exchange is at risk. Risk of your losing it. Siphoning off a small amount often, you only have the small amount at risk.

Throughout history substitute currencies have naturally arose as people felt the need, and they have made their own way.  You realize I would hope that this occurred hundreds of times, without any Jim Harper talking to regulators, without any Jim Harper's view as to how social change occurs, and without any Bitcoin Foundation?
So what or who needs you guys, except for those who can profit from the interrelationship as is the case with any lobbying organization?
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:34:48
Microgiving is not micro in the aggregate.
Micro is the movement of individuals, measured in millions to billions.  These are what make economic movements, and what creates the drift which constitutes social change.

No, the names of the board members were purposely not stated.  Almost none of the transcript items have any name.  Neither have names been stated on any matters requiring a vote.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:41:08
No, not like E-gold.  The simplest example of a "substitute currency" is the use of the US$ in a hundred nations as a currency or store of wealth in opposition to the local currency.  Nobody went to those countries and lobbied or tried to explain to their regulators "Here's the US Dollar!  Here's how it works!"
It simply infiltrated on it's own.  Same with bitcoin, it doesn't need any help.

I concur with the conclusion 100% "people should plan on the possibility that tax rates can be much higher than what they may think they could be by the time they retire.", but not the means to predict this possibility, eg the issue of the old rates.  COLLECTED taxes as a % of income have not changed markedly since the 1920s.

Okay, that's interesting.  I salute to this:
 I deeply care about the progress of bitcoin and would like to see organizations who present offerings through website-based interfaces utilize zero-knowledge configurations to protect their customers from oppression, censorship, and jail time imposed by unreasonable corporation-state organizations.  Unfortunately, the interest that most companies have in 'onboarding' customers, seems to have taken priority over development of systems that would protect privacy and anonymity of the users.  This ultimately works against the userbase and against the bitcoin ecosystem itself.

There was a recent comment by Frank Abagnale (Well known computer security expert and fraud prevention guy) on the subject of bitcoin.
"Bitcoin will make you the target of hackers who will steal your money," Abagnale said. "More expensive than other forms of payment, Bitcoin is a way to rob people of their life savings. Most important, if something goes wrong, the money may never be recovered."
JinYoung from the Bitcoin Foundation was asked what she thought of his comment.
"I hate to call him out on it, but Frank's kind of old," said Jinyoung Lee Englund, director of communications at the Bitcoin Foundation. "The people catching on to bitcoin and really investing are under 40. These are guys that came of age in the Internet, so this technology wave isn't new to them. To Frank, it's foreign."
Please give your opinion on who knows what they are talking about.  If you had been asked as a Director of the BF to respond to Frank's comments, what would you have said?

@_date: 2015-01-15 15:41:38
You were taking Jinyoung's comment literally, I wasn't.  I saw it as a simple quick ad hominem.....very likely from Jin who couldn't maintain a discussion for two minutes with Frank, who is very familiar with block chain and cryptographic protocol.  Note that Jinyoung never refuted his statements either in whole or part.
What's more centrally important here is that out in the world..."XYZ ATTACKS Bitcoin!!!"
Is it the job of the Bitcoin Foundation to make the response, and if so how and when?  In the cited case, is an apology in order?

Not a valid test, although it's good you point this out. The average person does not talk about bitcoin to his associates. If I pick a random hundred people, I'd be lucky to find a couple that knew the word. If I watch some traditional media like CNN, I really doubt I'll hear the word "bitcoin" in an entire week. 
There is a message in the silence. It is purposeful and not chance.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:50:37
Good thinking. There's a similar price curve for oil, because of a large steady requirement and a small variable requirement. For bitcoin, 20% of coins might be lost or Satoshi's, 40% might be HODLERs. that leaves 40% or 6.4 million coins or 6.4 Trillion.....

The current "high prices" are simply the result of larger numbers of people on the demand side - institutions and wealthy individuals. The only way to get back to "low prices" is for these people to exit back into fiat currency.
Mostly movement of money into crypto is a one way street. So that shouldn't happen. They might move from BTC to ETH, etc etc.

I would suggest a different approach to deciding about the student loans. 
You are not out of school or established in a career path. Hold cash (and bitcoin) reserves, and get that all figured out. Maybe it's not perfect, and you change jobs several times. 
Nothing wrong with saying "I'll pay the minimum on the loans for five years," then decide about paying them off in full. In the meantime, if you get cash poor suddenly and in dire straits, sell the minimum bitcoin to cover the immediate needs. 
Debt is NOT A CHAIN if you can pay it off any time. And other debts are probably looming ahead. Cars, houses. Those are the biggies. HODLing and selling only when crises demand it is the rationale approach. 
The classical wisdom here is ...
"Don't eat your seed corn."
"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."

The demand has to exist. One can look at this kind of thing by comparing monthly trade volume with PayPal, or MC/Visa, etc.
Is it fair to say that BTC is "mature" when it's trade volume is 10% of PayPal? PayPal is 120B 3rd qtr 2017, which is 1.3B per day. If you believe the numbers at this website  bitcoin trades are 2.9B per day. Currently double that of PayPal, but granted, many bitcoin "trades" are movements of coin between a user's wallets...

That is very true with bubbles of the past such as real estate. But the scheme of Satoshi is structurally different. It is not true here with bitcoin because of the limited supply. 
Also I have a feeling that money which moves to crypto does not seem to want to move back to fiat.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:46:04
I think the first rule is to get rid of any ideas about cashing it out quickly. Then be sure the computer has a good backup. Make two of them. Then make copies of whatever password files may exist.
The people who have made out with crypto are those who HODL'ed. I know you'd probably like to use the money for funeral expenses, but if there is any way possible, don't. Mistakes could occur in a rush to get the funds fast.

From the Bitcoin Foundation forum, this thread looked interesting.
Patrick Murck, on 06 April 2015 - 03:45 PM, said:
When I took the interim Executive Director role I was asked by the Board to cut expenses, increase revenue and generally shore up the Foundation's internal operations. In addition I was asked to present to the Board a sustainable path forward for the organization. The following Strategic Proposal was sent to Board ahead of our meeting on the 17th: 
My understanding was that the Board would come to consensus and work with the staff to create a communications plan for the membership to bring them into the discussion. Over the weeks that didn't happen. Many alternative proposals were also considered in the interim by multiple Board members, mostly based on this initial proposal.
Which direction the Foundation takes is ultimately a decision the Board should reach, hopefully with consensus.
This reply is of interest.
Several times, in the past, the matter of "what the Foundation should do and how" has been discussed on the forums.  I thought it was quite obvious that the core development needed to be split off. It was also blatantly obvious and ignored that the goals and interests of consumers and "industry" were at times diametrically opposed.
I am going to focus on strategic intent of the Strategic Proposal - strategic for whom?  Strategic for what?
The intent is to split off control of the Bitcoin Core and have it controlled by big money interests - those who would pay for the ability to influence the direction of development.  You explicitly state they would not want their interests compromised by a bunch of little people paying $25 fees.
"People willing to invest the large amounts needed to fund engineering want the ability to direct funding without the reputational or management risk of an elected board."
"Large donors don’t want to commit significant capital to an org where they must share 50% control of their funds with members who pay as little as $25."
"NewCo will be structured to specifically meet the needs of highest value contributors in terms of oversight of their funds, must likely through direct board representation"
These are your words.  This is the main thrust of your Strategic Proposal.  Bitcoin development would be controlled by a small secret cabal, without any user input.  
In terms of timelines the BF Board would have to create NewCo before the voting in of two new members which should be happening at this moment but is not ("Spring 2015 elections").  Now I understand why.  That election would quite possibly interfere with Board voting on retaining control of the crown jewels.
I have called for a meeting of the general membership in about 90 days.  It would appear that this general meeting has to be sooner, rather than later.
Would the general membership like or would approve of your plan?   Your plan an attempt to continue the same shady, back room secret deals that have caused the problems to date.  Your plan would institutionalize corruption.  Hello, Mt Gox Number 2, 3, 4 and 5!
I have cross posted this analysis to Reddit.
Do you think the general consumer base will like your plan?

I could also fire up a crate of two year old ASUCK gear. But it's very perceptive of you to take a wider view also. Let's be realistic, the successful spread of cryptocurrency into social organizations is highly disruptive because .... it's a disruptive technology. Some of that is going to whiplash back, it's inevitable. The current confusion, controversy and covert ops hidden behind benevolent political phraseology... maybe it's wise to consider it the new normal level, not something that will be over a month or two after the November events.

You said-
"The Bitcoin community and membership is generally very libertarian leaning so far more people in this space agree with these ideas than elsewhere."
There is no way to get the facts, but I suspect this is only the tip of an iceberg that includes members of Russia, China, and other definitely-not-libertarian places who are relatively okay with their country's political orientation and really seek safe havens for money.   It's probably wrong, assuming libertarians are a high percentage.

That it takes "a lot more money to send Bitcoin higher" is not the right perspective. Think in terms of mobile phone ownership.

Next thing there was a huge wave of new ownership among pre teens.

The more people enter the bitcoin market the more people that don't even know what their real keys are, this is inevitable. Maybe - just maybe - we have more reliable online wallet companies than 2013. Lower volatility certainly would contribute to that, along with more experience in the product.
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:17:06
Bruce, you said...The problem is not the rule or the procedure but the poor communication around it.
Actually, yes the problem is the rule, the procedure, the communcation, and the mis statements and defensive positioning at the wrong time and place.
To clarify, let us discuss Amazon's "buy with one click" program.  Which is great, right?  Naw, let's add a second click for confirmation.  We better add an email verification.  Maybe another email with terms and conditions that must be responded to.  Then a required survey, that'd help us ing marketing.
IS YOUR ATTENTION SPAN FADING AWAY?  Duh, the reason is that the "1 click and buy" is the best thing Amazon ever did.  Going the complete opposite direction, like the BF did with this "election process" is a terrible idea, certain to minimize participation.  But similar trends of thought have minimized forum participation and donations so at least we're consistently snatching failure from the jaws of success....
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:07:01
I understand but disagree. I believe my position is supported by the evidence. When you say "serious amounts flowing into the Bitcoin trading ecosystem" what is a "serious amount?"
What are comparables? Total stock market activity on a select stock such as ebay or amazon? Activity on a particular ecommerce solution such as apple pay, paypal or visa?
Depends on your point of view of course but "serious amounts" doesn't have much meaning....
By the way there is A LOT of cash out there looking for something decent to invest in. Reason is the US buying their own Tbills back to keep the interest rates down near zero. Savers can't make any money on their money. The low rates spread world wide, so it's hard to make a decent return no matter where you go.
The "serious amounts" are out there in amounts that are 1000x the amounts needed to make a dent in bitcoin prices...
