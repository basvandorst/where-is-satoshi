I mean in modern times gold has no real use as a currency. I understand it has other utility that bitcoin doesn’t as well, but let’s not pretend that people buy gold coins with the intention of spending it on a steak dinner. 
The only reason why gold has value is what you’re saying will kill BTC, public confidence. We as a people decided that this metal is worth something so it is. Sure, we make jewelry out of it, but there are plenty of other things to make jewelry out of. 
I think demand in some communities will drop.  But even today I know for a fact I am the one person on my entire block holds bitcoin. There will be plenty of people who are not here now and can and will use BTC.

IOTA has gone off the last few days for me. 
LUX too. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:33
It better be. I’ve been waiting for this correction and every day I’m losing money as it rises and doesn’t correct. Going to just bite the bullet soon
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:01:21
And, have no impact on the price in all reality. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:35:05
Because it’s the law
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:03:24
There’s no regulation. Is that illegal? Because that seems like a pretty easy cash grab. Don’t know why it isn’t done every day all day. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:42:12
I’m pretty sure it also depends on the length of time you held it, otherwise it’s just income. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:54:14
But you’re not actively watching prices hour by hour waiting for a dip

Yeah this guy is making a ridiculous argument. Gold is only valuable for the same reason BTC is valuable. Because we say it is. 
It has no modern use as a currency, only as a store of value. Of course, there is less time tested public confidence in BTC so it is much more volatile and risky. But the thing that gives gold value is the exact same thing that gives BTC value. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:40:00
No. That’s not up to me. That is the law. You asked why someone would do that, and I told you. 
I don’t really care if you don’t really care. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:08:53
Wouldn’t that be quite the long con?
Pump the living shit out of it for 2 decades just to short it and pull it all out causing a huge panic collapse?

Because he has a recognizable name in cyber security and people are dumb and go “meh computers, math... hard... he’s smarter than me let’s listen”
And he’s fucking batshit. So he’ll talk to anyone who will listen.

I know that’s why I stopped responding.

None of those things have anything to do with the price of it. Yes. It has value and always will have value because of what you’re saying. But the reason it is worth as much as it is, is simply because of its use as a store of value. An investment. 99% of the gold sold and transactions surrounding it are not buying it for the reasons you’re describing.

So if I pay a guy to operate my wallet in one of those countries I’m kosher right? Asking for a friend 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:36:41
Yeah I’ve been waiting for a huge price drop. I feel it coming. I really see it falling to 7-8k before coming back with a vengeance. But it’s not happening and pretty soon I’ve just got to follow behind you.

My wife is getting a very large Christmas bonus sometime between tomorrow and Christmas. 
Literally every day that passes is hundreds plus lost. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:58:56
Absolutely and that’s how I would like to treat it. But if I could have gotten away with saying nothing I would have. I just didn’t know the true power requirement. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:33:28
Of course not but it was a ridiculous argument so I gave a ridiculous answer. 
I shouldn’t mine bitcoin in my house because of global warming? Fucking kidding me?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:31:21
To be fair, there’s no way in hell you could have resisted the temptation to sell once it reached $100, or $1000. You would be a multi-millionaire at those points. 
Just to push you over the edge though... if you bought that $2000 at $0.20 each that’s 10000 bitcoins. If you held onto it all right now you’d have $100,000,000. 
But like I said. No way you’re hanging onto $10,000,000 and riding the wave when the price hits $1000. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:18:07
Yeah but I’ll be next to all my super rich friends in our self sustaining bunker because between now and the weekly hurricanes I’ll be throwing all my money into bitcoin and watch while it hits 100k

Well because of the number of solar panels we not only produce more than we use but are owed literally hundreds of thousands of kWs by the electric company. There’s a huge bank of energy there, and the electric company doesn’t have to give her cash for it so they never will, just credit at the electric company. Which she obviously doesn’t need because of the solar panels that have been here for over a decade. 
I’m considering being honest with her about it, and offering her a percentage of the BTC generated. Otherwise when she dies (she’s not old, but mid 50s) this massive energy bank just disappears so I feel like she isn’t going to care. She has said she loves the solar panels and when they die she’ll just replace them.
