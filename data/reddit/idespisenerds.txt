That does not make it a non-zero sum game. If no new value is created—unless we consider that value may be created by just moving items between players—it is a zero sum game. If we want to be really realistic about it, it’s actually a negative sum game, since there are transaction costs, but that’s not all that interesting to me. There are some people who argue that neither FX aren’t zero sums, because there are new players bringing new capital into the game all the time, but I don’t actually know of any theoretical basis for this kind of summation. Nothing is a zero sum game if you can just keep adding players between rounds.
At any rate, to bring this back to earth, Bitcoin and gold are very similar on a fundamental level when compared to stocks. Stocks generate new value, commodities do not. To earn utility by holding a commodity, the said utility absolutely must be transferred from someone else. To be cheesy about it, it’s the difference between buying a fish from someone and waiting until he gets hungry to sell it back to him for more and learning how to fish thus contributing to the GDP. 
From the way you write, you obviously already know all of this, so we are just talking about the same thing using different words.

The news in the OP is essentially what they have written on their own [website]( They state that it is in order to promote adoption of Bitcoin, which is of course in their prime interest as a Bitcoin exchange. Also they had some sort of ICO some months ago and their stock tanked somewhat after Bitcoin tanked.

I am not going to argue that we will not see massive changes in monetary policy in the next fifty years, but I am fairly confident that it will not be towards Bitcoin. We moved from the Classic Gold Standard to always changing nonsense of interwar to not-Gold Standard of Breton Woods to floating exchange rates. The reason we abandoned these previous systems is because they had so many problems you could write a whole book about them. In fact, many people have. Bitcoin would return us to those same problems we finally left behind us when Nixon finally nixed BW. The recent financial crisis is a walk in a park compared to the constant liquidity issues we were facing in the postwar.

I personally quite like *A Retrospective on the Bretton Woods System*, though it’s aimed more at the monetary policy crowd than an occasional reader. I would get it from a library before buying it. It’s rather embarrassing, but I don’t know of a good general reading book on the topic. Most of the literature is either country-based or aimed at those who have already done monetary policy in grad school. For specie and trade, you may want to read Viner’s Studies of the Theory of International Trade. It’s an old book and is available for free.
I have to disagree with you with regard to inflation. You are too focused on this idea of the petrodollar, which I am suspecting is a result of being exposed to goldbugs a bit over the safety standards. Hyperinflation is caused by nations printing too much money to cover their costs. There is a lot of talk about QE and how everyone is printing lots of money, but it’s very different from 1990s East Europe and any of a host of other countries with incompetent governments. After the Financial Crisis we were headed towards a de facto deflation. By expanding M0, the FRB simply shifted us further towards normal inflation levels. This is entirely independent of the position of United States’ dollar or its tremendous trade deficit. Very much the same QE has been applied in Europe and in Japan, neither of which has its own petrodollar nor runs a trade deficit. In fact, if you look at Japan and Germany specifically, they are typically running a slight trade surplus.

That’s a ridiculous thing to say. Having 100 mil in a fund can give you comfortable yearly payouts of 3 million in perpetuity. Having 10 mil gives you 300 thousand. Then you tax it and depending on where you live only half of each is left. The former means you can essentially buy almost all luxury items you will ever want, while the latter *just* makes you a very well earning professional.

It has been bad advice since the postwar era. It has been extremely bad advice before the postwar era for obvious reasons. It’s poor returns, low liquidity and no diversification all the way. You are much better with all caps world equity and paying a rent.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:24:33
That is true, but you have to pay it back the principal with interest. The said interest will consume whatever value you would have gotten out of saving on the rent and the growth of the value of the housing itself. It’s unintuitive, but the difference between paying the rent and paying off the mortgage and expenses you incur as an owner invested into equity makes you better off financially by the time you retire. Importantly, the down payment you typically make on a home begins collecting compound interest the moment you turn it to equity.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:54:56
Then they depreciate, which is the issue. I doubt that home owners are somehow good at timing markets, so the appreciation is largely a lottery.
There was a thread about this on Slashdot recently and someone correctly pointed out that historically the return on home ownership has been three times the principal between 1970 and 2010, once you add the returns from the rent and subtract the costs. That is without a mortgage. If you just look at the appreciation itself, it’s as little as 1.2 times for the same period. Both figures account for inflation and neither applies to REITs.
I actually had a friend of mine, a future owner of several homes that his family rents out to tenants, boast about how one of their half a million dollar properties increased in price since they bought it on credit twenty years ago. It didn’t take very long to figure out that one you account for inflation, the property had appreciated a measly 20 grand. Dude would have made more by just buying Treasuries.

@_date: 2018-05-09 13:30:13
Only if you’re entirely brainless. 400:1 gives you a margin call at a 25 bip move down. At that point, you either put up more money, which begs the question why you would be trading at 400:1 with a lower sum rather than at 200:1 with a larger one (it makes no sense at all), or your position gets liquidated and you are out. A 25 bip move is entirely unpredictable and can occur almost instantaneously. It is also easily accessible to your Average Joe as long as he has enough cash to pay the equivalent of a studio rent.

I don’t see the difference and you seem to be confusing two points.
You assume that more people will want bitcoin in the future and its price will appreciate relative to the dollar. My taxi driver assumes that more people will want gold and it will appreciate relative to the dollar. In terms of buying something to become richer relative to the people who haven’t bought it (what this HODLing is really all about), we are both taking advice from equally uninformed taxi drivers. 
If you talk about liquidity when you are discussing the benefit to the “community”, it seems tangential to me, because you really shouldn’t be keeping more than you need or expect to need in case of an immediate crisis in assets with high liquidity and low volatility as these underperform those with low liquidity and high volatility. As such, there is no benefit to me in terms of liquidity, because I could just as well opt for an asset that already has great liquidity and low volatility like the dollar. I gain nothing from bitcoin doing better or worse, because it’s just an intermediary.

Not a very good analogy. DAX consists of companies that generate profits. You can calculate the value of a share by projecting all of the company’s future cash flows, calculating their present value and dividing it by the number of shares. Good luck doing that with an asset that generates no cash flows.
Imagine if you bought some lean hogs and the next day Amazon unveiled a revolutionary new way to create synthetic meat that is cheaper and better than real meat in every single way. You would be very gently screwed at that point. Somebody will definitely still want some pork, but you can kiss the vastest majority of your money goodbye.

I am not trying to rub this in, but before somebody else decides to do this again, while he can still save up for retirement, one has to point out that if Bitcoin does not recover, those 200M are lost irreparably. What is more, alone the compound interest accounting for inflation between now and his retirement that would also be lost could be anywhere between 500M to 1.2MM if he retires at the age of 65 and invests heavily in equities. 
Assuming he started working late and it took him only ten years to save up the said sum, saving it again would only net him 250M or 550M of compound interest before retirement. That’s hardly a difference to sneeze at. 
The idea of “~~gambling~~investing only as much as you can lose” that is so often perpetuated on this board is not sound investment advice by any stretch of the imagination. I fully support your recommendation for spending some more time on more level-headed subreddits.

Oh my goodness. The “rich” don’t need any of those things. They don’t even need the dollar. Once you have a certain amount of wealth, the return on the said wealth from investments becomes greater than whatever productivity you could achieve as an individual worker. This means that, a few self-made billionaires aside, the richer you are the richer you will become relative to everyone else. A monetary system revolving around Bitcoin doesn’t resolve this issue. It’s an inherent characteristic of capitalism. At best, if it even ever took hold, it could reshuffle the wealth a little bit, albeit unsubstantially due to money managers working for HNWIs, from which point on the business would continue as usual.

Ooh, it’s “dipshit” now that you have missed the point by a fucking mile, is it? At what point in your Excel magic has it not struck you that your one year loan at a 3.5% interest rate is actually a 6.6% interest loan? Of course you can jack up the interest rate as much as you like to compensate for deflation, but each time you do so you drastically decrease the number of people who want or even can actually afford your shitty loan.
The fact that you are operating under a deflationary system cannot be changed no matter what “model” you toss into your little spreadsheet. As a matter of fact, your entire model is entirely redundant, as it provides some kind of a gliding payment scheme, as if your debtor could not invest the money he has now from his still lower mortgage payments to compensate for higher mortgage payments later on.

This U-shape was popularized by Piketty and specifically described as being caused by government intervention for the war effort and the very much central bank led policies of the 1930s. For Christ’s sake, this is when Keynesianism became a thing. If you look at [this graph]( you will also see that the brief stop in the wealth concentration process was specifically caused by the governmental policies during the two wars. The bimetallic and gold standard periods that you are so nostalgic about were the ones where wealth concentration was by far the highest. The *biased political actors* are the reason why you are not eating from a soup kitchen. You are drinking this goldbug kool aid so much you forgot what regular water even tastes like by this point, buddy. 
Ps: I’d like to point out that Piketty is actually a fairly controversial figure. Since he published his research, many have criticized him for essentially manipulating data by assembling it from pieces and stitching it together in a way that suits his narrative. Some of the financial stuff in his book makes very little sense too.

By “lend out at 2% deflation”, do you mean that you will lend out at an interest rate of -2%? If so, that makes no sense, since the money received would be less than the principal and nobody would lend anyone anything. If you didn’t, read on.
Let me explain the problem again. Let’s say, as in your example, that Bitcoin deflates at 3%. That’s absolutely reasonable as 3% is very close to the current rate of economic growth for developed nations. Essentially, this means that just keeping Bitcoin gives you a de facto real interest rate of 3%, while bearing no risk either in terms of volatility, currency or liquidity. We are currently in the low interest rate regime, so I will toss you a bone and put us before the Financial Crisis when rates were still “normal”.
The U.S. Treasury offers a so-called Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS), which is a bond that tracks inflation and has a fixed interest rate above the rate of inflation. Pre-Crisis, this rate has been 2% for a 10-Year, which is generally seen the most important among the bonds. This means that for a risk-free deposit for a period of ten years you can expect an annual compounding rate of 2%. Everything above it results from risk premiums in one form or another, be it stocks, higher risk bonds or something like a P2P loan we are discussing here.
Now consider the situation of Bitcoin deflating at a steady 3%. If you give someone who is “risk-free” a loan of 1 BTC out of the sheer goodness of your heart, they would have to pay ~3.09% (resulting from 1/(1-0.03) ) just so you get your 1 BTC back. Adding the 2% risk-free coupon, you would be receiving a real interest rate of a whooping 5.15%. That is already considerably higher than what you would get from the current risk-free debtor. Furthermore, assume that the person you are giving a loan to that wants to buy a house is not actually risk-free. Depending on what the risk is the interest will increase, however, it will always be the said 3% higher than it would be in a world where there was no 3% deflation, but a inflation of 0% or more. There is absolutely no way of working around this, which is why you are being downvoted for what seems to be little more than desperate appologetics.
If 3% does not seem like a lot to you, I would encourage you to consider how much that is in time value of money terms. With a zero-coupon loan: a loan of $100,000 for a ten year period at an inflation-adjusted risk-free rate of 2%—not that you would get it—would correspond to a return of $121,899. The same loan at a rate of 5.15% would result in a return of $165,231. That is not a trivial difference. In the current system, we are talking about a mortgage payment of $920.13 each month vis-a-vis a lovely $1,068.00 payment under the BTC regime.
Now if we made it a bit more realistic and made it a $300,000 house repaid over a period of 30 years, you get an even less advantageous deal of $1,108.86 payments in the current system vs $1,638.07 payments under BTC.
Do I even need to continue? This isn’t a new thing. We have had deflations before and they absolutely wreck the economy. The fact that it would be a deflation with a digital token as opposed to some precious metal by no means changes the fact that it would effectively bar large chunks of the population from having access to credit and decrease entrepreneurial activity on a level that only a Communist Revolution could compete with.

No, it’s not merely deflationary; it’s just it’s greatest drawback as a “currency”. It also has many drawbacks as a store of value, mainly being the fact that it is very easy to lose or steal with there being almost no chance of recovering the savings. The only thing going for Bitcoin has been its massive appreciation in the recent years. I can assure you that if it was still at a dollar after a decade, nobody outside of few fans would give a damn. Unfortunately for Bitcoin, this sort of appreciation does not necessitate that it will retain to say nothing of increase in value.

Many people don’t trust anything. This doesn’t mean that they will buy something that sounds even shadier and can wipe out several months’ salary by pressing the wrong button. Hardware wallets can still be destroyed and funds lost on an online service are not recoverable either. You are merely accounting for the said loss by paying insurance in advance. This is precisely what happens with credit cards already, although it is much easier to recover real currencies and the banks and payment processors do so routinely. This is a massive disadvantage that you cannot fix in a fundamental fashion. 
If we talk about currency as a national currency as opposed or a payment method, it can never be great. It’s deflationary, which is downright destructive for the economy. You need not look further than the Japanese firms that have been sitting on the deflating yen piles for nearly a decade now and look into as to why the Japanese government has been working their asses off to turn that deflation into a mild inflation since Abe became the prime minister again. This too is a fundamental problem. 
I think the best crypto can do is put pricing pressure on remittances services that are somewhat out-of-date now. It’s really a bit of a pain to pay globally still, although there are many FinTechs and banks like BBVA addressing the issue in a much more efficient manner.

Where am I bordering on hyperbole? Everything I have told you about is already happening. Not a single one of those was hypothetical. 
Yes, you can do all that, but do you see how you are merely producing means of reducing the problem, whereas there is no way to solve it. It’s an intrinsic part of the system. Each of those solutions has its own side effects. Educate individuals who can’t remember their Apple ID to not lose their seed, keep copies of the seed that can be stolen, etc. The fact that there are worse stores of values does not make this one any better.
As for Japan, I don’t think you fully understand the problem. The issue is not what you call your currency. It can be yen, gold, diamonds, earth, water, whatever. If it deflates, it messes up your economy. Now Abe is attempting to fix it in the case of yen and he is having some success. There would be absolutely no way to fix it in the case of Bitcoin.
Again, it’s a bad currency and it’s a bad store of value. There are no two ways about it. It’s a good speculative asset though, which is ironically the underlying tone behind everything on despite the whole mantra of being in it for the tech.

While I agree that converting prices back and forth is an annoyance, it is the least of your problems when you are in a foreign country the language of which you do not speak and the culture of which you are only mildly familiar with.
There are also offers specific for frequent travelers and expats that address multi-region issue. One very new and interesting offer is Denizen from BBVA. There is also a number online banks that are every bit as insured and comply to the same regulations as brick and mortar banks, but offer everything you’ve listed by cutting costs on physical branch offices.
I am abroad almost all the time due to my work and it’s really not an issue anymore.

Can you just admit that the reason you think it is better is because it appreciated a lot in the past years? It really strikes me as the one point that is made genuinely, as opposed to quickly strapped on to make a point. It’s perfectly fine for it to be a fundamentally bad currency and a bad store of value but be a good speculative asset. You don’t need to feel that it somehow has to be everything at once.

Is that so? What about a Johnny come lately attempt at a deflationary currency?
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:57:36
Two points.
1.	This has nothing to do with the US dollar that the bet is about. The USD may “collapse” and you can still lose if Bitcoin doesn’t appreciate sufficiently under your conditions. It’s silly. 
2.	This is a “heads I win, tails you lose” bet. The further BTC drops, the less your opponent wins in real terms. The higher it goes, the more you win in real terms. It’s a silly proposition and I find it rather telling that you are not only trying to pussy out of your original statement, but also try being a really mediocre scam artist. 
Come on, real stakes with no bullshit. Real 10,000 Big Macs-pegged currency of choice for you and your opponent. None of this imaginary store of value or fiat nonsense. Delicious calories that you can eat only.

Your first sentence is an almost universal excuse for a fuck up in the past. You can replace drugs with prison time, declaring bankruptcy, molesting children, working in a death squad or just about anything else and it would still lead to a lot of personal development. Cut the crap, stop being a little bitch and admit that you fucked up instead of encouraging the retards in this subreddit to follow your brilliant example. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:13:12
That’s a nice excuse, chicken, but fortunately I have a solution that would work for both of you: agree to a sum with a purchasing value of a certain number of Big Macs. So if you lose, he pays you in Bitcoins equivalent to 10,000 Big Macs. If you win, you pay him in USD equivalent of 10,000 Big Macs.
Come on, this is your chance. You can put your money where your mouth is. Quite literally in this case.

And the Titan of the Industry who made the Bitcoin version messed up. The older data is classic economic history textbook material. I recognize at least some of those curves and the *electricity* set is obviously *automobiles*. You can see it in your reference if you are good at telling colors apart. The person publishing this didn’t even bother to check if it makes sense. Did Americans sit in front of their color TVs without electricity in the late 1970s?

No, that makes it a fantastic speculative asset for those that bought it before last autumn. What does the rally have to do with storing value? Think about it for a second. A store of value is something that will not depreciate, have a high beta or be easily lost and stolen. BTC is really bad in the two latter categories compared to almost everything else in traditional asset classes. It does not matter how many of these precautions you put in place. It’s still much easier to lose or steal Bitcoins than it is to lose or steal gold, which has been a fantastic store of value for God knows how long.
I suggest we just drop the whole Japan bit, because I think we are fundamentally talking past each other there. The point being made since the start of the conversation is about deflation, not about whether the money supply is being controlled. You can have an deflation with or without a central bank; there is no fundamental relation there.

Sounds like a fantastic way to reach wide adoption. You must be a consultant or something.

Except the bit where it’s a public ledger with the paper trail going to your bank account. Confiscating Bitcoin is the easiest thing ever. One guy plays hard and ends up in a penitentiary, everyone else turns in their coins to not make their children fatherless.

Reading is hard, eh? You were literally offered the fairest method imaginable, you dumb shit, after which you’ve offered the least fair method imaginable and I don’t think you even understand why. Nobody gives a shit about your smart contracts, especially for a bet completely different than the one you were offered.

Why do you need a site for the exchange rate? Shouldn’t it be attached to the purchasing power? And why would the government want to change rates on the site? It would only benefit the money traders. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:08:37
I don’t know, Aussie, this may have something to do with you guys cheering up a drug profiteer who hires hit men torture people, cause he promoted the currency that will be around when the dollar collapses, i.e. in three to five years. Also deflation is good. Krugman and Buffet don’t know shit. That all makes total sense and I don’t see why people would be making this community the butt of the joke more than they do something like or Totally beyond me.

This is a great point, but it only shows how unexperienced you are in basic personal finance. You have just rediscovered the concept of a cash cushion and an emergency fund. You should have one already and whether you take out a mortgage or not does not effect its size. Even if you are a UHNWI, your emergency fund should not be the size of a typical mortgage, so excuse me for being direct, but you are just making up bad excuses for why you can guarantee that Bitcoin will rise in price but decide not to act on it. You are literally keeping your money as far away from your mouth as possible and that for a very good reason.
