But does it do segwit and batching? If they implement it now it should theoretically be easier than retrofitting coinbase, but then again the seemed to have no problems rolling out bcash with much less time to prepare than segwit. Would love to see a better alternative to coinbase than Gemini which is still mempool bad actor.

I am not saying you are wrong, but it is not quite as clear cut as you lay out. We don't have any proof that hoodlers are acquiring more than the supply is being inflated by mining. I am inclined to agree with you and am in fact a hoodler myself.

At least we have commas that way. 100000 may not be better than 0.000001, but 100,000 is. You also have the shorthands e.g. 100k Satoshis for bitflix or 1M Satoshis for the shoes. Could have a symbol used after the number like ¢. I agree Satoshis are the only way to go.

Bitcoin cash has 8MB blocks, but they aren't full, so average blocksize is smaller.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:50:11
What drives the price besides adoption? This isn't a stock. If you want to argue that the price has moved up independent of adoption recently I might agree with you, but in 2010 we didn't dare dream of the levels of adoption we have now. I am disagreeing with the timeframe more than the premise. The idea that nothing has changed since 2010 is absurd. Adoption is just one obvious example. That is what I wanted to point out.

You are correct and I stand corrected. I still think we are better able to plan for scaling if we have an existing fee market. It also provides economic incentive to implement segwit, schnorr, etc. I do believe core has the correct roadmap for scaling; I could be wrong.

It is inflated (due to DDA), it is massively centralized (mining and nodes), and finally what happens when the block rewards stop and they need fees to pay the miners?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:00:01
Why are you so convinced that they are the same person instead of two different people with two different opinions. There are lots of people on Reddit.

Why would Lightning network transactions not work for transactions between you and the exchange? Sounds perfect actually if you are making frequent trades back and forth with the same party. Exactly what we should keep off the block chain.

Just did the same. The problem isn't even fees the real problems are these shitty fee estimators. How is it I can look at  for about 20 seconds and find a fee that confirms in one or two blocks, but both mycelium and samourai wallet recommend fees 4-5x higher. Samourai is currently recommending 377 sat/byte for my segwit TX. WTF?

Can anyone recommend a decent API for free estimation? Something like take mempool -1mb of transactions to get a fee. That is basically what I do. I feel like it isn't right to criticize the devs of these apps unless we can provide a better alternative. Obviously there are some clear bad actors, but apps like samaurai seem to be doing their best and already provide multiple API options for fee estimation.

I guess I can use USB OTG and an A to C cable. I haven't tried that. Still the whole reason I preordered the Model T was USB-C support. Kinda lame. Trezor support says it should work at least with the desktop over USB-C. They recommended I buy a third cord. Both of my cords work with all my other devices and are from OEM manufacturers.

That would work, but anyone you give the address (QR code) to would be able to link all the transactions together.
