So is this dead?
@_date: 2019-07-04 05:13:30
Can the next hint provide a direction for how to solve the puzzle? I don't know if another word will help.
@_date: 2018-09-01 01:47:29
I think it might be you.
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:13:59
No way.
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:37:02
I’m starting to have doubts as to whether or not this is legit.
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:35:16
Could it possibly be both a book cipher and a vigenere cipher? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 16:07:09
Realistically, I don’t think even another seed word would help at this point. Too much randomness.
Also, the lack of OP response is disappointing.
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:58:43
Is this the third or fourth time?
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:55:39
Bitcoin isn’t a company so I don’t think a comparison is needed. But if I had to say so, yes it will eventually.
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:39:52
Any luck?
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:42:14
I’m in the same boat as you.
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:54:48
Does each date set represent a letter? For example, 519910919 would represent a or b or whatever?
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:15:48
I thought the article looked familiar and then a remembered something I read earlier this week....[NY Times Article]( 
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:56:50
Ahhh I see. I’ll take a look to see how much power its drawing when I get home.
The payment of the power bill is a bit weird. The money I get for housing goes straight to a private management company that runs the housing. Utilities get included in there but we never see a bill or any type of refund. We can kill the power for a month or run it nonstop and it won’t change anything. However, we’re very eco conscious so we limit our power consumption.
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:45:58
The pages haven’t changed since the puzzle was posted.
Here are the numbers for the large puzzle. The text broken down by line is at home:
And the small puzzle with the line breaks as in the picture:
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:57:48
Makes perfect sense now. Thanks for taking the time to research that. Still new to all things bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:53:48
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:25:28
Careful in terms of the electricity bill or it messing up my computer?
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:49:56
So we know that we’re looking for 12 words. Can you say how many total letters? 
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:19:16
Better latte than never!!! 
Dad jokes....
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:43:19
Well my idea on how to solve this went out the window. Still too many possibilities in my mind. A start though....
@_date: 2018-08-20 06:01:32
I just made the mistake of actually reading the article.
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:37:40
Sorry about that. I posted the link to the smaller prize. The cipher with the larger one is 
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:52:35
I’m pretty sure that is the recent price with the added charge from the ATM. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:47:48
I don’t know much about traditional markets but I assume if people saw one large investor selling what they are holding, they would assume that that person knows something, potentially negative, and start to unload their holdings.
@_date: 2018-08-25 22:50:02
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:40:23
Agree. We need something to start with.
@_date: 2018-08-03 05:22:36
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:57:57
Don’t forget price predictions....countless price predictions.
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:40:41
The best thing to do would be to spread them around. For example, send me 100. I would sell a few and then hodl for a while. Do this with a few more people so it’s not one person selling them all. Market crash avoided.
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:44:41
Have you tried to type in your seed phrase and not just copy and paste? Yes it sounds dumb but I read a post recently about a guy who was having issues accessing an old wallet and somehow that simply worked for him.
@_date: 2018-08-24 07:38:36
I’m new to ciphers but I figured you somehow spilt the numbers in each date set, do some adding and then correlate a number to a letter but I’ve had no luck
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:51:25

So basically the tips will sit in your reddit account until you move it to a wallet? I feel like something has went right over my head. 
Neat feature though.
@_date: 2018-10-19 00:25:42
The twelfth word is “wrap”
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:35:59
This is pretty cool but why one puzzle with 310 BTC? It would be interested if it was broken down into smaller amounts over more puzzles....Just a thought but thank you regardless.
@_date: 2018-10-19 00:27:04
It’s “wrap”
@_date: 2018-10-10 05:31:25
Nothing public yet.
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:09:14
u/frankbet Can you say where the p or c in “escape” are in the set?
@_date: 2018-10-13 22:27:59
Are all the numbers relevant to the solution?
@_date: 2018-10-29 02:43:19
u/frankybet...Are still going to release the ultimate hint at the end of the month?
@_date: 2018-10-14 07:43:13
Are the sets currently in the correct order?
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:58:13
If we find a way to assign letters to each date, will the resulting letters be in plaintext or do we need to further apply another shift?
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:59:08
It was solved yesterday. No idea what the solution was though.
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:12:51
I agree with the transcription.
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:31:35
Nice solve!
@_date: 2019-08-16 07:46:17
I’m having a hard time seeing a pattern in this one. Font detection in photoshop is hit or miss so hopefully that’s not it. Might be time for another hint.
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:03:20
Is the hint going to be posted here or on the site?
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:10:39
Another hint after 7 days?
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:47:06
I think Satoshi’s stash is enough of a burn pile.
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:00:39
I agree that it was designed to be money. At present, you can use it as money to buy goods in a limited amount of places. However, to me it seems that the vast majority of its current use is as an investment and a very volatile one at that.
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:05:41
@_date: 2018-07-28 03:52:56
I agree with the OP. The community should focus more developing open source tools that a small business can easily integrate into their operations so that BTC can be used on a daily basis.
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:04:57
Imagine that though. I would have been celebrating. Someone is trading that much, meanwhile I’m trying to solve bitcoin puzzles just to get my first.
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:45:07
Thanks for all the feedback everyone. I’ll take a look at everything you all brought up and do some more research. Again, thanks for taking the time to enlighten me!!!
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:56:21
That’s a bit of a markup.
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:59:31
No way does the USD fluctuate this much. The only people making money off BTC are early miners, big miners, and those who can absorb $14,000 swings in half a year.
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:46:30
Has it been determined if this is legit?
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:10:22
Not sure about the accuracy of the percentages in the question but I think the point is valid. Additional coins past 21 million are not coming. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:17:42
I’ll be excited when I can pay for gas with BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:16:16
Who cares about ETF. Not what this coin was created for.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:00:48
Pretty sure it’s because of slow user growth and declining profits.
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:35:59
I’ve had Coinbase funds in my checking account within 24 hours if it was done on a weekday.
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:35:24
Thanks for the update. I’m glad it worked out for you in the end and that luckily nothing bad happened. I wish that one day I can also say I hold a fair amount of Bitcoin... ��
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:16:48
Any more clues?
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:51:34
You sold 1.2K BTC? ��
@_date: 2018-07-11 08:51:07
It’s been interesting.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:20:00
Well said!!
