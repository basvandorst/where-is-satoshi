Just wanted to chime in and say I'm the owner of CoinRnr.com and I'm happy to answer any questions about it.

WOW horror story. Thanks for sharing. I will say that I purchased a Lamassu machine when they first came out and have been nothing but pleased with their customer service, support, and product. I'd highly recommend them if you're still up for another bitcoin machine fiasco.

The order form is set to expire every 3 minutes in order to give the user the most accurate price we can. You'll have to click through the order form a bit faster in order to lock it in.

What the hell haha. That is very weird but explains the password reset issue.

Would be awesome to have you there, I appreciate it. I don't think this is a common problem but I'm not sure. You can yell at  and see if they can help you.

Exactly, that's what I had in mind. I'll also send people in the direction of bitcoin.org to read some of the good beginner content but was hoping I could find some more short videos to show as well. Ideally something that isn't a homemade tutorial with a lot of talking over a screencast.

Yes they do accept americans and the cashier uses only BTC/LTC. There are very minimal info signup requirements but feel free to check it out yourself (betcoin.ag).

I couldn't agree more. Thanks!

I definitely agree with this notion. I don't want to force them into only the big centralized exchanges but it is certainly the easiest way to get up and running.

Noted - thank you!
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:09:24
Thank you for the suggestions! I will check these out and see what is useable. We should try to keep the videos around 5 minutes (maybe a 10 minute 2-parter max) as we have limited time in the breaks and will lose some focus from the viewers.

Unfortunately due to some technical issues, Betcoin is not going to be hosting WPN tournaments for the next 10 days (see  so the main tournament I wanted to stream is no longer offered on a bitcoin-only platform. This kind of ruins the premise and killed some of my enthusiasm for it. We will have to reschedule this for when WPN tournaments are back on Betcoin. It doesn't have to be a 500k, the Sunday 100k or something will do I guess, but there has to be something exciting enough to stream. We'll try again later.
