WTF? Exactly how did they act "Ethically &amp; Professionally" if they knew about the situation at hand before the crisis document was leaked and remained silent - and more than that made no statement of any kind, but waited for information to be revealed ( accidentally ?) by what might be called a fortuitously informed blogger - 
They had much more ample warning and inside information that something was wrong - and instead of warning Bitcoin holders and the community at large, all they have done is published a Document in which they Wash their Hands of the Matter entirely. 
TL:DR The Major Bitcoin Players had inside info and would still be silent if the crisis strategy document weren't leaked.

Hacked Paypal accounts are a dime a dozen - it's common knowledge. 
Don't know about the UK laws but here in the US as a retailer (or an ebay seller) you are considered legally responsible for verifying that the identity of the buyer is in accordance with the name on the bank/credit card/paypal account. 
Also Paypal usually will flag transactions as suspicious within 1-3 days if they are made from hacked accounts. 
So if you must use Paypal - make sure you ask for proof of identity or at least wait a 3-7 days, before sending coins (remember they can reverse the transaction, or get reimbursed with buyer protection - but as a seller you'll be out on a limb). 
**TL:DR Don't use Paypal (but if you really insist, prepare a little bit before hand so you know what you're getting into).**

doesn't matter if you fill real orders, biggest the percentage of real orders that are immediately withdrawn is small, so you still have access to most of the funds anyways. 
You're thinking of a case where you make multiple accounts, but in the case of centralized exchanges both buy/sell balances are effectively held by 1 account.

This is a bad comparison. 50 Billion in a regulated market vs. the m2 money supply is .004 or .4%. 
400 million of Gox bitcoins relative to the market cap of Bitcoin is &gt; than 6%. 
See a difference?

That's not quite correct you have to 'fill' real buy/sell orders, it's just that you are able to do it out of the very pool where the 'buy/sell' order funds are going.

He has a lot to lose from giving false information and loosing people's trust (business wise) - 
There is a chance he himself is wrong about the information (but I think he must have second guessed the risk estimate a lot more than anyone else in this ).
