Im aware of it. I also admin r/bitcoinAUS so I am unconcerned with being banned here. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:59:48
And the domain name bitcoin.org 
@_date: 2015-12-30 02:36:35
Bitcoin block size was set at 1mb to deter spam not raise fees. Fees will come when the block subsidy stops and hopefully by then there will be a lot more users to pay them meaning each user pays less. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 05:13:19
Theres an easy way to prove it beyond doubt. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:10:00
Its ironic they deleted a response on a thread about censorship. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:19:55
You don't need fees currently that is what the block subsidy is for. Forcing higher fees without reason is because of GREED.
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:12:07
I have a mini pc plugged in and all it does is connect to the internet and run a full bitcoin client. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:51:09
The main reason it is dangerous for one person to control so much of the bitcoin information space is this attack -
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:06:33
There was no block size limitation when Satoshi released bitcoin originally. Personally I think it should scale with usage rather than be set arbitrarily by decree. There should be some protocol or rules for that. My OP was about one person controlling so much of the bitcoin discussion space and the possibility this makes them a threat or a weakness especially when they also hold the alert keys. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:07:46
The network effect is difficult to overcome. Thats why bitcoin is still the main cryptocurrency and it wont change unless something happens. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:51:54
The disempowerment of the community will kill bitcoin faster than anything else. People don't like to feel ignored. Voting sucks but its better than the alternative which is authoritarianism and dictatorship. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:13:09
There currently exists no way to short bitcoin. The ability to do so would help with volatility dont you think ?

They will probably sell them to insiders.
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:29:10
I would be more concerned with them installing a backdoor that lets them seize wallet.dat files at will on PC and mobile platforms...
As for crashing the market they could only do it once, it would let more people climb aboard cheaply and most of the coins would no doubt be snapped up. 
At least one of the early miners had a cluster of pc's (knightmb) so it could be him.

The local community was hit hard after the hazelwood mine fire. This is an attempt to lift their spirits and take their minds off things. Running events like the free store, setting up a community garden and a market are attempts to improve community spirit in one of the lowest income areas of the state. 
There has been a couple of local news articles.
There was a sheep on the site keeping the grass down it had a lamb. It loves its cushion :)
Morwell Community Garden

Edit: Thanks for the donations! There will be a community wall on the side of the building where people can "sponsor a brick". If we get enough bitcoin donations we will stick a logo up there for you.

The site was abandoned by the main developer and the bitcoind daemon shut down for the last month or two. He then took the code and coins down off the server  without notifying the company. He still has the 400 coins in his possession and Ive been trying to get them returned to the users. Yes Im a fucktard for putting up with a lazy sys admin and failing to take a backup of the coins or database. That doesnt mean Im not trying to make things right after all I am here trying to sort this mess out. Its a good lesson that even someone who only pays for hosting and the domains needs to be wary of running a bitcoin site without any coding knowledge.
@_date: 2012-11-17 20:40:32

@_date: 2012-11-29 22:12:40
create your own version of bitcoin where all the coins are generated in the genesis block. You might also look at open Transactions which offers most of what you want.

To say I was pissed off was an understatement.
@_date: 2012-02-29 06:09:41
It wasnt right of me to bring bitcoinconsultancy into it. It was my confusion over the state of their agreement because for many months the sys admin was in Poland with their company and claimed he couldnt access the site because his pc was back in the US. He is also listed on their website as a part of their company.
@_date: 2012-02-29 06:04:56
The coins are still in the coders possession so Ive been led to believe. Deserting a bitcoin site and leaving it open to compromise is not wise :)
@_date: 2012-02-28 00:27:14

Im an asset issuer and I got verified by glbse today. While you may have a fake ID they ask for more than just the ID they also ask for a recent photo of you to compare it with.

If you want your bitcoins back go and post there and pressure the individuals involved to do the right thing.

You can probably add GLBSE to that list.

@_date: 2011-09-21 16:29:42
They are completely different owners. The bitcoin police themselves are in contact with the owner. They know who he is, the company that owns the site and his address. His motivation is to provide the best experience out there for bitcoin users. If you use the code BETALUVDISC5 you get a nice discount for your first few orders.

No you cant just walk into a gold warehouse and do this. You need to have a retail relationship with them first. Thats where coinabul comes in.
@_date: 2011-09-13 08:33:18

Nice job jackten.

People who double post are retards who deserve what they get.
@_date: 2011-09-24 01:24:11
I understand the reservation to using a new bitcoin site. If you are concerned coinabul will be introducing smaller amounts of silver and gold you can try out first and build up to larger amounts. Not every bitcoin company is dodgy some of them are linked to real world ones with consequences for doing the wrong thing.
@_date: 2011-09-24 01:16:39
Coinabul works with warehouses directly. Do you know any gold mines that accept bitcoin directly ? There are no fees because the discount coinabul gets from suppliers is applied to the price. Its like walking into a gold warehouse and buying it with bitcoin. 
Yes coinabul is like a bitcoin buyer.
Whatever you can do with gold using usd youll be able to do with bitcoins using coinabul. The site isnt even out of beta yet!!
@_date: 2011-09-16 14:54:24
also  lol
@_date: 2011-10-14 10:41:05
I hope you can prove your allegation because that is outrageous.
@_date: 2011-10-11 05:52:22
I dont think it would be wise for them to sell bitcoins using credit cards do you? There are way too many issues with chargebacks.

lol true. Check out the post I added a company coming soon that will sell gold directly from suppliers for bitcoin...

Reddit wont take buttcoins :)
@_date: 2011-09-21 16:26:11
He accepts bitcoin and you get gold. Coinabul works directly with gold wholesalers.  Its about as direct as youll get unless you go to the mine itself.
@_date: 2011-08-21 10:08:54
Its SOLID!
@_date: 2011-05-28 00:48:09
Mt Gox now accepts aud deposits using technocash.
Also 
@_date: 2011-09-24 01:20:03
Not going to happen. MtGox cant be everything for everyone. They dont know anything about working with warehouses or chain of supply logistics. Mt Gox only deals with bitcoins. Coinabul deals in physical metals and specialises in this one thing. 
@_date: 2011-09-05 09:08:16
ArtForz hacked solidcoin and in the process revealed a serious flaw in bitcoin which hasnt been patched yet and which solidcoin is immune to.

I love reddit but cant use the payment methods they support. As do many of the people who replied here.
@_date: 2011-10-11 11:02:00
Depends if you include tax and customs duties etc.
I had a look at other sites selling gold for bitcoin and coinabul looks up to 20% cheaper...
@_date: 2011-10-11 05:12:41
  you can buy bitcoins by sending them gold...
@_date: 2011-09-16 14:46:16
I agree. They can even use an api such as bitpay and not even deal with converting bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-10-12 22:12:50
@_date: 2011-09-18 01:46:45
This is the info we have at the moment.

@_date: 2013-12-13 09:00:19
You are probably correct sir.
@_date: 2013-03-29 11:43:41
The big difference is bitcoin doesnt have a government you can lobby to point guns at your opposition or keep new competition out.
