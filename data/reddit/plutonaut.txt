After a hard fork BTC and BTU will share the same heritage blockchain. Going forward from the hard fork coins mined on either chain will be tied to that chain. BUT coins from before the hard fork exist on both independently. It's likely only one will succeed so buying coins before the hard fork is an insurance policy. You're staking a claim on both.

Hedge buying - with pre-fork coins it doesn't matter which branch prevails. BTC vs BTU vs BT(all).

Proof of quantum AI time travel. The past is now locked in the blockchain and the future will never be the same.

Thanks! But I'm puzzled by the this statement on their GitHub "BitID is not a general-purpose identification system. It should mainly be used when a Bitcoin address is paramount to the usage of the site or application, and when this usage is a long-term one - it wouldn’t make sense for a tipping service.” Why not use it for more?

Interesting. Is it any good? How do they approach the key management problem?

This sounds like what I'd like to do! In your game each client generated it's own address and used that -correct? Transaction signing can then be made easy for users within the app. And, in theory, users can be given a way to back up their ID (aka bitcoin address) Where can I get your game?

Knowing how the service you choose to use makes money should be one of your first deciding factors. If it is unclear stay away.

Down if the stock market crashes as a result of a credit crunch. In that scenario people are selling their stocks to get cash to pay debt. No cash for Bitcoin, so its cash price goes down despite its continued value.

Gamblers win big and loose big. Any time you expose yourself enough to go bust you're a pig ready for slaughter. 
Investors win big and win small. There is nothing mediocre about that.

It can only be $0 if EVERYONE is out. That  won't happen because there are enough who believe in seeing its vision through.

If the price is falling and you are buying incrementally it lowers your average. So when prices recover (if that is what you believe) you'll be in a better position for gains. That's the point.
