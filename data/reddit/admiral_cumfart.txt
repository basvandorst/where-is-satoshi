It is though I am leaving my BTC in Coinbase until the fork. You get credited for the new currency as well for each amount of BTC you have in your Coinbase account at the time of the fork. After I will move all

I have an account which did not have a recovery email. One day the password was changed and I’m not sure by who or why. Do I have any recourse?

I’m just so confused. Why do people think we should create so many different types of bitcoin and how do you even make that profitable for yourself? Genuinely curious

Can someone explain all of this to me in English? I have some bitcoin but not a miner. Will this affect me?

Well without that transaction you wouldn’t have contributed to the value of what bitcoin is today. Don’t fret - I had mined $0.06 of bitcoin back a few years ago and it’s $4.00+ today. I should’ve bought some back then instead of mining and giving up haha
