How was the pizza?

Looks good! Where did you order from? I'm going to be in the area at the end of the month, might have to place an order. :-)

These guys have killer jerky, maybe they'd work with you! The Moonshine jerky is addicting.

Thank you for this. 
My father emailed me the North article this morning and I've been putting a response email together all day. This is much more concise and to the point than I have been able to do. 
Well done.

Tested the mac version. The game is quite difficult. Consider adding different difficulty levels? Possibly slow the Borg cubes down and have some that don't fire? 
I don't usually use a mouse and it took a few minutes to figure out the controls, a user guide might help. :-) 
Overall, fun and am looking forward to updates.

Thanks, yeah I noticed the post was deleted. I scanned the file before running and am scanning the mac now.

Woman here, trust me I've got the bug! I have strong feelings there are more women into this than most think. We're around. :-)

Maybe, I spotted them on coinmap.org a few days ago.

I counted 7+ in the album. Not a huge number comparatively but still a presence.

Give it time. Took me about two weeks but it eventually happened. They're innundated with new accounts and are a small company. Patience. :-)

Bit bit coin, y'all.
