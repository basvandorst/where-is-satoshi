No. Kindly read my other comments. Thanks.

This seems like an idea.

1. I never said I paid high transaction fees, I just said that using Bitcoin will lead to 9% more profit. They aren't related.
2. Everything isn't troll.
3. Even if I am not a Business owner (which I am), this'll certainly help at least someone in future probably.
I think you should leave, it's better than claiming anything to be a troll. :)

You are very correct. My margins are pretty low, and PayPal's $0.30 hits me a lot. Credit Card TX providers have nearly the same fee, plus the instrument rental fee.

1. They already work for me at a fixed rate, lower than $50 per hour. I have a part of the developer team who **only** does unit tests &amp; A/B testing with new product placements, payment methods, design and revenue generation methods. So, there's no *extra* cost.
2. Got your point, thanks.
3. Got your point.

You are very correct. The developer made a unit test for the website yesterday, probably within 8 hours including asset setups and other things.

9% is **not** of total amount but the profits only. My business would die if I offer them a flat 10% on all products.

I'll look into this and recalculate stuff. Thanks.

Interesting. I only knew about BitPay until now, because ~~one~~ few of our customers sent that in via suggestions page.

I love you.
Is it a possibility that you could inbox me that flyer design as PSD or whatever it is?
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:29:37
That wouldn't be much possible. The business is time sensitive, but making process faster for some will cost us bucks more than we could afford.

1. There won't be a big cost. The developers would do it in their regular working hours.
2. How do I calculate how many Bitcoin transactions I'll have?
3. How do I calculate the additional revenue without even having an estimate of sales made with Bitcoin?

I don't get many chargebacks. The transactions are micro and has less than 0.1% chargeback rate. I consider this successful so far.
