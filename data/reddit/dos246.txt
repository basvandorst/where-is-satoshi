"Both Binance and Bitfinex are listed in Hong Kong, but Binance’s servers are in Korea."
"In response to China’s decisions, we are moving our IP’s from Hong Kong to an offshore location. Now we have our IPs registered in BVI ( British Virgin Islands) and other locations. So we are registered in multiple locations and we have people in multiple locations. That way we will never be affected by one regulatory body."

30 Days ago bitcoin futures become available.
It was also about 30 Days ago that bitcoin hits ATH.
Would it be possible that the sharp money (whales/institutions etc.) bought up a whole bunch of bitcoin leading up to the opening up of the futures contracts. Then they shorted the futures hard, knowing that they could all dump their BTC and send the price way down and profit 10x from the futures. They do own about 40% of the market right?

[Cash FAQ] (
How long does a transfer “In Review” take to process?
Once you’ve processed your withdrawal in your Cash App, transfers to the blockchain can undergo reviews, and it may take 24-48 hours for you see a transfer in your external wallet.
That's obnoxious.
