I had an account w BlockFi almost maxed out as far as the high interest rate (6.2%),   The day they cut my rate to 2.25% was the day I withdrew my entire balance.   I could stomach the risk at 6.2%, and I did make a good chunk of interest in the few months my account was open, over a half of bitcoin.   Now I use Celsius as they pay out every Monday, and they use 2FA for withdrawal.   I made one massive withdrawal with BlockFi and everything went ok, but I did have to directly speak to someone in their office.

I’ve been here since it was the 21 club that was the goal to aspire to.  But at the time that was less than $10k, less than $5 for a period.  But during that time, it had done nothing but go down for the last 2 years or so, so even though it didn’t seem like a lot, it was a huge risk!  Even for someone who speculates.  Even in 2015, owning 21 was a goal of many of this very forum.   
I tell good friends I know that can afford it, that if they buy 2.1 they’ll be set for life someday in the future.  Especially friends who have recently had children, by the time they graduate 2.1 will prob pay for their entire education and then some.  I know I have pledge a full BTC to my nephew if he should be accepted into college (he’s 9 now).  
I tell good friends who can’t afford it, to just buy .21, or even .021, as it’s still a good investment, long term.   
Even knowing about it today, as you read this, (unless it’s 2025 or later), consider yourself lucky to have heard about BTC before most of the world.

I think of it like this... 1 bitcoin, is one Satoshi, which is 0.00000001 BTC.  A BTC is a name for a bundle of 100M Satoshi, or bitcoins.   All bitcoins are fungible, each and every one has a private key and can be sent and resent through the network an infinite amount of times.   This is how Satoshi could get a LOT out there in a relatively small amount of time, and still keep the mining going long enough where it has a chance to take over contemporary and future banking system.   Yes there will only be 21M BTC, but there will always be 21M (approx, -lost Satoshi) x 100M Satoshi.   If a Satoshi becomes worth 1 penny, a BTC would be worth $10M US Dollars.   I already think a penny per Satoshi seems like a good deal considering what you get for it, and what a Satoshi can do compared to what a penny can do.

Definitely practice before you start trading... at the end of the day, just hold, you’ll almost always be better off...
Welcome to bitcoin!

I notice mainstream media articles always point out how it crashed 70% last year and how it’s regained XX amount.   It’s not like it was at a steady $20k, it was a few days at $19 on Coinbase iirc.
I agree it’s different than 2017, where as most are completely oblivious when I ask if they’ve seen the BTC price lately, and most knew when it was rallying last time.  
I don’t think any strong mainstream media attention will be paid to BTC until it returns to $20k.   I’ve been buying and holding since 2015, so I’ve seen the cycles and studied the ones prior to me getting in.   I agree that this cycle will go much higher, possibly turning $20k into a flat like like we did $1k last rally.
Go BTC!

Never sell all, that’s a rookie mistake.    Always hold some, or you will regret it later... also learn about it, as if you did your research you would never invest more than you can afford to lose, and your end game wouldn’t be selling, it would be holding until you can use your bitcoin to purchase what you really need, and at that point the price will be much much higher than it is today, netting you more of whatever you need...  good luck!

I keep my crypto in my BlockFi account.   Here I’m earning 6% APR compounded interest, paid out monthly in BTC, so it’s the same thing as making monthly buys for free. 
I also have an account w the Celsius network, which pays out interest every Monday in BTC.  The rate fluctuates weekly, but has been over 6% most of the time.   This week it’s 6.1%.   This isn’t compounded.   
There is a limit on how many coins you can keep in BlockFi (to earn 6.2% APR), and also a minimum amount needed to earn interest, I believe it’s .5BTC.   It’s been very nice so far, I’ve been earning interest since February.   Coins are stored by Gemini, so I feel safe about it.   I’ve been in this space since July 2015, and I’m a firm believer, I’ve done hundreds(if not thousands) of hours of research. 
This isn’t a recommendation, just an account of how you can essentially make monthly buys for free.
EDIT:  The 6.1% (Celcius) is the annual percentage rate, you don’t earn 6.1% weekly, you earn 6.1% APR.  An easy way to figure your potential weekly payout is take your BTC amount, multiply by percentage rate (0.061), and divide this amount by 52 (weekly payments).  With BlockFi, it’s the same, but 6.0% compounded yields 6.2% APR, so the formula would be BTC amount X 0.062;  divide that by 12 to figure your monthly payment.   The price of BTC doesn’t matter as you make interest off your BTC paid out in BTC.   As the price goes up your interest earned is worth a lot more.
