To be clear, I am only talking about reducing the amount of minted BTC, never increasing it.  So the payout would be &lt;= 25 BTC (at present), so there is no issue with hyper-inflation.

Thanks for the suggestion about using Etheruem.
Yes this is just tweaking knobs, nothing revolutionary, however the key point is precisely that the hashrate is involved, unlike the halvenings based solely on total minted amount.  I am just trying to think of ways of stopping the hashrate increasing unchecked forever, primarily out of concern of the PoW energy usage problem.

At least he put in some thought, as he clearly went home and changed suit before kicking down the door...

scores an A-, which is very good, and the same as bitstamp

UK tax law on crypto is all here 
1. if you are day trading, get an accountant
2. if you bought, held for a month or more, and sold, it is capital gains tax.  If you held for less than a month, then you potentially need to look into the "bed &amp; breakfasting" rule

Yes, according to my accountant.
He says that no one will be able to get away with the "gambling" option mentioned in that report - although he would say that....

Yes the chances of finding the private key of ONE particular wallet is astonishgly small.  However the [birthday paradox]( kicks in once you are looking for ANY wallet, and the fact is that a small project with very little resources has already successfully generated the keys for 2 wallets.
So the point stands, it is secured by math, but it isnt the most secure network in the world as the op states.
Also, quantum computers would destroy the mathematical "security" of bitcoin.

Bitcoin is NOT 100% secure.
One of the ways it is not secure is there is nothing stopping someone from randomly generating the same private key as you have for your wallet - have a look at the Large Bitcoin Collider project, who have already found keys to other peoples wallets (and "moved" them for their saftey)

The [Large Bitcoin Collider]( is a project that tries to generate the private keys for other peoples wallets - and they have already found 2!
Basically if you have a large stash, don't store it all in a single wallet!
