Bitcoin has 1 MB sized blocks, BCash has 8 MB. Bitcoin has Segwit, BCash does not. Different ideas on how to scale Bitcoin.

Well the guy above's explanation isn't quite accurate, there is no credit involved. Essentially with Lightning payment channels you lock up an amount of Bitcoin to that channel, so you can't double spend that Bitcoin somewhere else like on-chain. The two of you have a ledger that you mutually agree upon, and if ever there is a disagreement one party can push the last agreed upon state to the blockchain for arbitration. The standard blockchain transaction fee occures when the channel is closed, so the best case for two cooperating parties is that their channel is pushed to the blockchain as little as possible.

Segwit is short for Segregated Witness. It's a way of increasing the amount of space in the block without actually increasing the block size, sort of removing parts that were unnecessary. Bigger blocks allow for more transactions per second on the blockchain and cheaper fees, but the downside is it increases the size of the blockchain quicker, increases centralization as less people can run a node, and it eventually becomes unfeasible when you're trying to fit hundreds of thousands of transactions a second. Most people on this sub advocate for a limited block size with Bitcoin scaling under layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network and/or sidechains.

Centralization on Lightning is a potential issue because of two reasons: control and node failure disrupting the network. As long as end users have multiple channels open neither of these should be an issue because there's always other paths available, and you can always ignore bad actors. IIRC current plans for Lightning wallets create multiple end user nodes.

They happen to be right... until they are wrong.

Short Bitcoin, PLEASE. I want you to. I really really really really want you to.

yepper, in the past month out of like 2 years of growth
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:23:20
Yeah I'm just curious as to whether nodes are only really connecting to those "hubs" or if they have other connections as well. I don't really see centralization to be an issue if end users have multiple channels to access the network. I don't know how the software for this early version routs but it seems ideal if each personal node has several (4-8 perhaps) channels open. Cool visualization btw
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:17:05
I'd like to see what it would look like without those 5 nodes.

Careful if you sell it to reddit, easy to get scammed.

I thought atomic swaps require on-chain transfers though? idk this is one thing I'm a little ignorant on.

Lots of news about it moving to Canada and other countries, which is pretty cool.

You stupid shills, we all know Bitcoin Clashic is the REAL Bitcoin.

IIRC it's run through the TOR network, every connection is encrypted.

I believe a lot of people use CoinTracking for keeping track of their crypto portfolio. You can download a CSV from pretty much all exchanges and import it to CoinTracker, or if you pay for their subscription you can use each exchange's API to automatically track it. I'm pretty sure the free version requires you to manually input any transactions across exchanges/wallets though.

I'm sure you'd have no problem getting 10 bucks in every month or so if you knew it would increase 15000% but that's just hindsight

Thanks for that, very enlightening.

What's your Bobcoin address I'll send u bobs.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:15:18
I'd personally wait a month or so for LTC. Check out the price history of LTCBTC and you can see Litecoin is at a high. Assuming the pattern is repeated you're likely to get more value holding BTC right now. Just my opinion, depends on what time scale you're trading with as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:21:32
I'm really not seeing how there can possibly be a monopoly if anyone can run a node. There's literally zero barrier to entry so the free market should ensure fees remain minimal.

I've heard you can seed certain software and hardware wallets with a string of words. How does this work exactly? Also are these seeds interchangeable with other wallets that support string seeding, for instance having three copies of the same wallet on a nano ledger, trezor and software wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:43:31
Good luck! This sounds like a life changer
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:36:30
I'm not really sure how this form of "centralization" is an issue at all, as it's not like they are really holding your Bitcoin. Furthermore if you really want to avoid hubs you can make a direct channel with whoever you want to transact with, it's just more work on your part.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:59:25
There is no upper limit to block size, increasing it is a non-solution
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:18:54
A lesson learned lol
