I think the point of your comment is to say: 'you're saying we don't allow people to die because they can't afford basic necessities, and therefore we wouldn't in Ancapistan; however we do allow them to die now and therefore would in Ancapistan as well. '
Those 45,000 people are probably people without access to dieticians, cardiologists, and oncologists until they're too far gone to save. In Ancapistan, the market incentives would not be completely thrown out of balance and the uninsured would still have reasonably cheap healthcare, like it used to be. Also, charities.
Let's take a step back from the analogy though. wasn't referring to healthcare, he was referring to emergency services like fire and police services. If you're neighbors house was on fire in Ancapistan you'd sure as hell help them put it out because that's just what neighbors do.
The rebuttal of the analogy you have is like comparing apples and oranges. 'People will die from emergency cancer!' Cancer is serious, but it's not stab wound to the neck serious.

Whether or not you subscribe to my libertarian vision of Bitcoin is one thing, but Bitcoin is not, nor ever was, intended to be a speculative vehicle to get cryptoanarchists and techies rich. At the very least, it's a novel social experiment about cooperative, self-rewarding system.

False dichotomy. The FBI should not be doing domestic intelligence collecting. They should be conducting criminal investigations. If they're getting evidence from, oh say I don't know, the NSA, and then fabricating its genesis, then the State has behaved inappropriately.
NSA can do they're spying (they shouldn't... it's a separate issue though), and the FBI can behave like its supposed to. No intelligence gathering techniques had to be disclosed.

@_date: 2014-09-10 12:16:17
No? Ad hominem. Of course criminals are going to want a good criminal defense. Regardless, everyone deserves one. It's a check on the State to keep them from being overly aggressive in collecting evidence and suppress minorities. Which is exactly why it *does* matter how the evidence is collected, regardless of its validity.
No I don't feel guilty for wanting to make sure the State operates within the constraints it has set for itself. Yes it matters how evidence is collected.

What keeps you from agreeing practically? What is wrong with what's theoretical?
1) Criminals are bad people. Should be tried and found guilty through proper procedure
2) We have a constitution and laws in place that are supposed to prevent what the feds have done to DPR
3) It's better to allow guilty people to go free instead of standby complicit in the unfair, unjust, and illegal methods the feds use to incarcerate people.
This is my theoretical argument. I don't believe I have factually anything incorrect. The argument hinges on  If you disagree with it, how many people are we allowed to throw in jail who are innocent to insure no guilty people go unpunished? 1? 10? 100,000? If even one guilty person walks free while innocent people are jailed, this theory becomes moot.
Any number you pick is arbitrary. This argument only stands under a consequentialist interpretation of morality, and that's not a philosophy I'd stand beside.

Same thing with Bitcoin. You can sell your USD, GBP, Euro, whatever. You can maybe sell things online like on the silk road (though most of those things are illegal). You can also work for them, but as of now very few if any companies are paying in Bitcoin. It's still in its infancy!
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:38:21
I respectfully disagree. While I'm not sure exactly how I would price Bitcoin, I know that since the last ATH, there has been a considerable increase in market acceptance and infrastructure.
Coinmap has probably 10x as many businesses accepting Bitcoin as opposed to one year ago. Recently SecondMarket started accepting Bitcoin and VC money is pouring in like crazy. There are more exchanges and many, *many* more wallets than this time last year. It's no Facebook yet, but it is growing quickly.

Gotta say though, each and every argument you've put forth has had a logical fallacy in it. This one is red herring.
It's not that I care who found out about a broken law or whatever you're trying to say. **I care that the federal government isn't behaving appropriately and is making an example out of a high-profile drug dealer**. Forget for a moment the unjust laws, forget for a moment the US gov't doesn't have political legitimacy. Under their supposed legitimacy, they're breaking their 'social contract' with everyone by violating the rights of everyone and side-stepping and breaking the law in order to fleece some idiot drug peddler. That's the issue at hand.
They're breaking the law to throw a man in jail for breaking a law. What they're doing is unjust, and the laws they break are far more serious than his (to the best of my knowledge, I think dragnet domestic spying and sharing of said intelligence to throw a man in jail is arguably more serious than running a drug trading website.)
**The federal government has behaved more inappropriately than him, his incarceration and presumably his detention are unjust.**

I can see from your water analogy that perhaps you're implying that the government can affect it, but it will settle back to its natural state eventually? Not sure which is better though.

You could probably tip addresses known to participate in p2pool. They might not win all the block rewards but if they could stay financially afloat with tips and occasional blocks that would be fine and probably incentivize more miners to move to the model.

Strawman. It's not that I want criminals to get away with their crimes, I want the State to behave appropriately.

Laws never get overturned if they aren't challenged on their merit. We'd still have segregated schools if it weren't for *Brown v Board of Education*. Clearly the law was what it was, but that doesn't mean it isn't wrong or ripe for review.

Libertarians don’t say there shouldn’t be a fractional reserve banking system. In fact, it’s almost inevitable. What they oppose is a central bank that can artificially prop up this system dozens of times over. The Fed was created to level out the boom and bust cycle, but instead it perpetuates it. Fractional reserve banking in the absence of the Fed still creates wealth, but banks are restricted to actual levels of risk when they loan out money (i.e. they must be careful not to loan too much for fear of a bank run). Now they’re insured for $400,000 for every depositor and the Fed props up banks that are ‘too big to fail.’ Essentially, there’s no risk to lending… kind of like the housing bubble? But when this pyramid scheme can’t continue to support itself, the crash is much harder and more severe. 
Your glossy vision of what the Fed was designed to do creates a lot of moral hazard in the economy. Sure, they create economic wealth and sure they ward off bank runs, but the recent recession among many since the Fed’s inception prove the Fed can’t stop an economy from contracting. Edit: but they sure know how to grow it to dangerous levels so when it does contract it seriously hurts for years to come.

I'm certainty not one for government regulations. See: my username. But as it is right now, and particularly so with businesses that make money by exchanging it, one needs the government's blessing to operate. 
To freeze out all businesses that get bitlicenses will effectively mean that there will be no businesses that bitcoin users can use except decentralized ones and perhaps farmer's markets. 
This regulation is bad news, but supporting businesses that lobby against it (even if they're forced to get the licenses) is better than freezing out all businesses that get one.

All of them. Justice can be served in other ways, particularly if the State no longer owns a monopoly on justice. The power to to rob someone of their life is very great, and mishandled it shouldn't be.
'Guilty' in the court of public opinion (or even your opinion) is not guilty as determined by an actual court, so  is moot. Criminality is not relative when the the State has a 'justice system' (if it can even be called that anymore). Criminal justice is also supposed to be based upon some ethical system, but if guilty people go unpunished and innocent people are punished then either the criminal or ethical system needs reevaluation.
Understandably justice is hard to get right 100% of the time. It's far less immoral to allow guilty people to walk, than it is to to jail innocent people. That's why the system was designed 'innocent 'til proven guilty' and why there are rules in place for discovery and admitting evidence.

Jesus Christ. This isn't a bitcoin post at all, this is just a get-rich-quick pump-and-dump post. If Bitcoin is bound to be the world reserve currency or whatever you may dream, then worry not about the price fluctuations. But manipulating the price for your own gain is arguably slightly evil. If you want the coins, cool, buy don't by then for the sake of making them expensive.

No you'd just need to see all the unspent transactions in the blockchain and then index all those addresses, not every one ever. After you have a much smaller pool of addresses, then you can sort it by final balance or total coins or whatever.

Imagine a parking meter where you send whatever it costs for an hour, two hours, etc. and in the message you simply include your license plate. The timestamp on the transaction serves as your starting time and a computer can automate when a car is supposed to leave and send an alert to a meter maid to see. Seems pretty straightforward.

Debatable, but I disagree.


Neither are 'bad' like you've said. Bitcoin has a huge head start in market adoption, etc. If dogecoin wants to stick around it either needs to live on the merits of its idiot meme or provide something useful to the cryptocurrency ecosystem (like I already said).
I wasn't saying doge is bad, just worthless.

Pre-mined. Can you explain that? Wasn't Bitcoin pre-mined by Satoshi Nakamoto? Or does pre-mined mean that 1/3 (or whatever) Idiotcoins are already brought into existence and given to Idiotcoin Address, then the remaining 2/3 are mined like every other Altcoin?

I've seen a lot of people around this community admit they've been wrong, been open for criticism, and outright accept that Bitcoin is an experiment and very well could fail. It's not the pot calling the kettle black, it's imperfect humans calling the kettle black.
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:08:32
Well I was trying to keep it as simple as possible like the original commenter was asking for.
1) Paper wallet (cut off private address, store at home)
2) Scan public address, use blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info to view the address (should have no balance)
3) Purchase bitcoins in public, standby and use your phone's browser to go to your public address. Refresh every 5 mins, until transaction appears (wait longer for verification, but this step isn't imperative)
4) Enjoy.
No accounts required at any website except I guess localbitcoins.com

I don't really disagree with anything you said except I'm curious about one thing. You said back in 2012 you could see the innovation then. That's when I first started following bitcoin, and it seems to me that innovation is really just getting started. You imply that back then is when innovation occurs, are you referring specifically to the profitable business models in Bitcoin-world or technology in general?

That's not relative, they're illegal. There are some jurisdictions where both of those are legal, and in those jurisdictions, to the best of my knowledge, people aren't jailed for it.
Pretty clear:
1) Where illegal, people are prosecuted
2) Where it isn't, people aren't.
Not relative.
Ethically, yes a relative case can be made for why either is moral/immoral.
Also, stands to reason you concede to the rest of my argument? Or are you just arguing semantics now?

@_date: 2014-07-14 10:56:37
Because all transactions are grouped in blocks in the blockchain, miners need to verify that a transaction is valid and they do so by checking previous blocks. You don't need to spend the full amount from an address, just enough inputs to your public address that are equal to our greater than the amount your trying to spend. Of course you'll direct the remainder of your unspent blocks to your change address (primarily this is your public address).
I'm not sure this is helpful, but I hope so.

Classic Somalia strawman. Another commenter left you with an academic work for you to read but I'll give you a video to watch if you prefer that explains how fallacious it is to say that, the moment they fell into anarchy, they should immediately be some utopian vision of anarcho-capitalism.
There is a lot wrong with Somalia, but flowers don't grow overnight. If you give it healthy skepticism, you may not come to the same conclusions but you'll realize how absurd it is to compare anarchic Somalia to some idealized utopian standard.

In no way am I wanting to discriminate who does or does not get bitcoins. I just don't want the Chinese government making it confusingly difficult through back-and-forth ban/unbans for people to get ahold of. There has to be a better way to get Bitcoin to Chinese citizens than through centralized exchanges that are susceptible to state banhammers. 
That's what my original comment is referring to. I realize that may not have been clear initially, but you could've taken a charitable approach to interpretation and used the history of Bitcoin in China to realize that I was probably referring to PBOC instead of discriminating against Chinese citizens.

When you use a website with a ToS agreement, you imply consent to abide by those rules. Whether you know them or not, violating them constitutes a breech in contract. No one's forcing you to participate on this site, you're here voluntarily which implies your consent, if you're unhappy with that you may use digg, Facebook, or any number of social media sites in place of reddit.
Tl;dr if you don't like the rules you never read but still agreed to, leave.

On the contrary, we've tentatively come to realize this is a technology that's here to stay but is currently under valued.
Whereas before we weren't sure and therefore were content with low volatility, we have now come to accept/realize/believe that mass adoption is imminent and therefore a paltry $600 is low-balling.
