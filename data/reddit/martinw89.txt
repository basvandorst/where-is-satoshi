Pretty sure you got whooshed. The precursor to F was distributed computing for the genome project. The above commentors were referencing that.

Merkle trees are something I'm not familiar with other than their mention in Satoshi's original whitepaper. So excuse my ignorance in that, but I just don't want to spend the time learning it despite my fascination with bitcoin.
But here's my logical fallacy ridden thinking: if a reference implementation was so simple, how come no one did it earlier? The ever growing block chain size has been a concern in the community for a long time now: it's a barrier to entry for new less technically inclined or less technically interested potential Bitcoin users, the size has become significant especially in regards to potential mobile clients (at least for the time being), and as time goes on and the transaction count increases each block will only make the chain bigger and bigger. So since we all know about these problems, how come no one else took the baby steps in making reference Python code of a whitepaper?
I realize the logical fallacy there, but since I don't actually know about the difficulty in creating a Merkle tree implementation, it's all I've got to go on.
And anyway, if you really are programming often, you of all people should know that you can't measure the difficulty of solving a problem by how many lines of code you make. One shining example I can think if is Carmack's (or at least attributed to Carmack) fast inverse square root function. It's "just a couple lines of code", but at the time it was a *very* big deal in code optimization for 3D games.

This is one of the best parts of social content/news aggregation websites like reddit: getting extra article information like possible biases etc. Definitely sheds a new light on the article and makes me think of some statements in a new context.
I mean, regardless, obviously any sort of pyramid scheme is going to be bad, and should be outed and avoided. It's just that some parts of the article went outside that scope.

Actually, the chain is up to about 3.3GB now, and it takes *forever* to get the most recent blocks compared with earlier ones, because SatoshiDice. If you don't turn on the client for a week you can expect to spend a non negligible amount of time catching up.

Thanks for the detailed reply. As you can see from my earlier one, I was more concerned with trivializing everyone's efforts than the title, but now I see that that's what you were talking about. And we can definitely agree that sensationalist titles need to go. And in regards to that, I've definitely seen a lot worse, but I can also agree with you on this one.
Anyway, yes, it would be a shame if Socrates1024 got all the credit, since his baby step to a practical implementation for bitcoin is just one step of many. Hopefully everyone will get credit where credit's due as we see this evolve.
As usual, watching bitcoin grow is fascinating.

To spend bitcoins associated with an address, you need that address's [private key]( Every time you made a new wallet, you were also making new addresses, with new private keys. The wallet files stored the private keys for you - that's why you have to be so careful with your wallets.
[pywallet.py]( is a way to import keys into a wallet. But, the "default" / "Satoshi" wallet application (Bitcoin-QT, the one you get at  now has the ability to import private keys into your current wallet using the [importprivkey]( command.
However, given what you're confused about (which isn't anything to be ashamed about, barriers to entry for newbies are still really high), both of these methods will probably be too confusing. So Julian702 was saying you could open each wallet.dat individually, and send a bunch of transactions to whatever address you're going to use to sell.
Have you made more than 100 addresses, or sent a lot of transactions, etc.? Unfortunately, [that could be a problem if you have](
In the future, you might enjoy trying out the [Electrum]( client. It simplifies a lot of this process. And you don't even need to sync up the entire blockchain to get started. But if you're really paranoid, there's probably less people examining the Electrum source code than the Bitcoin-QT source code. 
**TL;DR:** Open up each wallet and do a bunch of sends to one consolidated address.

Bitcoin users are still too sparse for this to be practical. Same goes for offering services / goods for Bitcoins - using an exchange is just so much more convenient since there's no eBay equivalent for easily offering goods / services in exchange for Bitcoins. Yeah SR offers a little bit of everything, but that's about the last place I think of when I'm trying to sell my old camera gear.

No. You'll make 1 BTC in about, oh, a couple years, accounting for difficulty changes and block reward halving.

Screaming RTFM isn't exactly the best practice in anything, and doesn't really help bitcoin if you're actually interested in it and not just trolling. And god forbid byronjstevenson wants to ask for bitcoin help in a bitcoin forum.
Also, this is like someone coming into a car forum asking for help replacing their battery and them being told to go buy a manufacturer's shop manual and attend a technical college for automotive repair.
Actually, nevermind, pretty sure you're trolling. Whoops. I fell for it.

I merely have an armchair interest, but I'd think jets experience more stresses than most airplanes due to more significant thermal loading/unloading because of their higher flight ceiling. Additionally, I'm assuming jet engines require more expensive maintenance than props because of the extreme heats, tight tolerances, and overall necessity to avoid exploding.
Are there 737s that have lasted for 30 years that I'm only slightly worried about? Sure. Some have a tendency for the roof to disappear (seriously), but for the most part they've had excruciatingly meticulous regular maintenance for their entire service life.
A private jet on a less than legal website being sold for non-returnable currency on the other hand... yeah.

Thank you for having a level headed observation of how our society works. I've seen a lot of "let 'em burn" and "free market fixes everything" opinions in the BTC community, but people don't realize the social cost of people going broke. People that are stupid enough to (for the sake of example) think they can get 3,300% annual interest definitely don't deserve much leeway, but everyone else has to realize that unless we as a society want to accept way more people dying on the streets that we're not going to see the end of welfare etc., and there's also a huge cost to society when we lose potential productive members.

I know it's late for you, but for anyone else reading: [Electrum]( is a very easy to use thin client that, while not as secure as a paper wallet kept in your glass relocking floor safe, is still *way* more secure than trusting a website. The most secure software option is using the official/Satoshi bitcoin-qt client, but it can be a bitch waiting for the block chain to download for that.
So if laziness is your only factor stopping you from leaving an online wallet, try out Electrum.

This is a phenomenon you see a lot on internet discussion locations: the "let's all pool our resources and do something amazing" flops. Whether it's something financial, an *idea* for an open source project, etc., I've never seen one work. And plenty of these ideas for open source projects are so much less ambitious than this island thing.
Problems:  
1. A subscriber count or even an eventual pledge list is a like a Facebook confirmed guest list. You might get 2 people who are actually going to shell out money.
2. Organization and leadership
3. Outside regulations
I'm sure all of you interested in the project have heard Negative Nancy Debby Downers like myself and are going on anyway, so good luck.

That's really interesting. I double checked my data directory, and the sum of blkindex.dat, blk0001.dat and blk0002.dat sure enough adds up to 3.32GB. I wonder why our local block chain copies are so significantly varied in size.

Never heard of bitmit before, I'll have to look into it. 
But yeah, if you can accept less convenience, I agree that getting BTC in that way is just a lot better for everyone.
