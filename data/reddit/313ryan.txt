Again, I'm 17. Taking 4 college courses in highschool, SAT prep + a job + guitar concerts and probably has a brighter future than some wise guy who's first instinct is to be a tough guy behind a screen. *I dont need to prove myself to you* especially when I asked for *help*

Got nothing better to do than be a piece of shit on the internet?

Oh haha! Everyone's laughing

Your hilarious man! Too bad I'd rather fucking shoot myself than hear more your your great jokes
@_date: 2019-11-20 12:17:30
You guys skip over the part that I'm 17? Go fuck yourselves

I expected the growth to be a single percent growth and earn a quarter or two. Did you miss the fact that I'm 17 and its intraday? Seriously, what do you get from being a loser on the internet?
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:59:54
That's why it dropped!

Also, I know Cashapp isn't ideal, but I wanted to start early and hands on. I'm currently taking a college course in stock trading. But I'm 17.

Thanks, its intraday so I panicked when it dropped heavily on Monday

I'm 17. I threw $10.32 and its intra-day. What do you expect?
