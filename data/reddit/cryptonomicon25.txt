If it's a private key any bitcoin wallet can restore it. If it's a standard bip39 seed phrase then most wallets can load it, though I think electrum is different.

If you solve the puzzle you'll instantly have access to the wallet. Just import the private key or seed phrase. You'll know when someone has solved it when the funds in the wallet have been moved.

Of course I'm aware of that, who would agree to use their service for sensitive data if Amazon controlled it? My point was that the servers are centrally controlled by one company. AWS outages have happened before and will happen again which disrupted many high-profile businesses. Having ANY nodes run on AWS is not a good idea - it's a terrible, horrible stupid idea and you should feel bad for even considering it.

I think we are miles apart in our views concerning the fundamental philosophy of cryptocurrencies. It's not just about network resiliency, it's about having a currency controlled only by individuals. Leaving things to the mercy of large corporations is just asking for government regulation and control of the network. They are dying to crack down on crypto - let's not make it easier for them.

Because then the Bitcoin network will be at the mercy of one shitty company.

Enough with the patronizing, I know how these services work, probably a lot better than you. Yes, I'm saying that nodes should only be run by individuals on their own private servers. That's the whole point of decentralization. If an outage happens on AWS, Azure, Google cloud, IBM, etc etc. thousands of nodes could go down at once. If everyone has their own private server and one goes down then the network is barely compromised.
