It seems that Hashocean's site is offline and it will never come back. I am also from one of them who lost their hard earned money even without receiving single payout. I was increase power by reinvesting to receiving a handsome amount per day.
But dream are over now.
I'll pray for its comeback.
After this event, it seems that all cloud mining companies which are not interested to disclose its company and data center information are fraud.
But few days back, I found a company which is very open with its company as well as data center information. I have joined it and found that it’s also offering ROI but not as much fast as of hashocean. It take more the double the time to return your investment.
It seems stable and safe.

Pulse Point of Genesis Mining over hashocean
1.	Bitcoin Mining didn't give this much fast return as hashocean was offered. But if you have tried mining at your home, returns are almost near as genesis-mining offering( after deducting its profit/maintaince)
2.	Genesis Mining didn't give any repayment calculator in its panel. Because it make you greedy by showing results as "more you invest, faster will be your returns".
3.	Genesis Mining didn't offer any futuristic graph for calculating "how much you get in 1 day, 1 week and 1 year".
4.	Genesis Mining didn't accumulate your returns for reinvesting. It gives daily transfer to your wallet, whether you want or not. For reinvest you have to pay exact same as you paid first time from your Credit Card / BTC wallet etc. 
5.	Genesis Mining also share contract papers with you which was nowhere in hashocean.
