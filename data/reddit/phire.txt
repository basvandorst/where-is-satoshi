Say this was possible and you have your guaranteed 37.5% savings and you have gotten your 22 bits down to 14 bits, why not repeat the process. 
2^14 is even easier to crack and the address space would shrink down to 9 bits. You would take your 9 bit public address, crack the 14 bit private key and then use that as the address to crack the 22bit private key.
You could repeat the process again and shrink your 9 bits down to 6 bits. And again to 4 bits. Then 3 bits. It bottoms out at 2 bits, because 2 * .625 = 1.25, which rounds up to 2 bits.
But you can't complain about a compression method that gets 22 bits of data down to just 2 bits (aka 4 possible public addresses representing any of the 4,194,304 possible 22bit private keys) and if you wanted to go deeper you could pack 11 of these 2 bit public addresses into a new 22bit private key and repeat the process, compressing 242 bits down to just 2 bits. You could repeat this process over and over again until you summarized the entire internet down to a single, easy to remember number between 0 and 3.
TL;DR: Any method that guarantees a fixed compression ratio of every input breaks the universe.

Also, less than 1% of bitcoin users run exchanges. How can their views possibly represent the majority?

This paper is a good overview of the technical details of ASICBoost:
I'm sure I saw a second paper, or perhaps a reddit comment which went into more details, but I can't find it now.
The Naive Algorithm still works and it's only depth_of_tree times harder to brute force. The depth of a 1mb block is around 12 entries, so they only need to add 12x more hashing power to the hardware which generates the header collisions, then those colliding headers can be sent out to unlimited miners.
Edit: Found the second ~~paper~~ blogpost:

Only one method of covert asicboost doesn't work with segwit.
It should be possible to derive another covert method which is segwit compatible. Doesn't even require switching out the current miners, only the hardware/software which generates the partial merkle tree collisions for each block needs to be upgraded.

In crypto, a 12x increase in difficulty is very much on the smaller side. 
Remember, this is just for a small cluster to generate the collisions for each block that can be used for near unlimited profit. I believe I saw someone saw someone calculating this cluster for the optimized sub-tree swapping method only required 16 gpus.
I think we can all agree that increasing this theoretical cluster to 196 gpus is still really cheap compared to the amount of extra effective hash rate that it unlocks on unlimited miners.

What they did is add "hashrate crash protection"
Which is a simple rule, if there are less than 6 blocks generated over the last 12 hours, drop the difficulty by 20% for the next block. Generally it will trigger on several blocks in a row due to variance and you will get a 36%, 48.8% or 59% drop depending on luck, and stay there.
It's designed to keep the block time below 2 hours (8% of original hashrate), and allow the network to limp towards the next 2016 block difficultly recalculation. 
Ironically, this patches a flaw in bitcoin which the bitcoin unlimited guys were planning to use to force the whole network to hardfork to 2mb blocks with only ~70% of the hashrate agreeing to such a fork (if they ever got to ~70%)

But we're not comparing them side by side. We are comparing the percentage of extra profit that it enables.

I'll charge half of what he offers.

The 2mb part is in the code already.
A large number Miners won't run the segwit2x code unless both parts are included and locked in the the same time.
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:46:44
No. Segwit2x only has to activate mandatory signaling of bit one by August 1st to be compatible with BIP 148.
The actual locking in and activation of segwit itself might happen a few days or weeks after August 1st.
However, the current timetable is looking much more optimistic.

No, They are privately mining on a 3rd chain.
On August 4th, there will be 3 chains
 1. The legacy chain, longest chain of valid blocks (under 1mb).
 1. The BIP148 chain, longest chain of valid blocks, with a restriction that all blocks after August 1st must be signaling for segwit. 
 1. Bitmain's chain. the longest chain of blocks, with a restriction that the first block after 12pm August 1st must be larger than 1mb.
Because of the "larger than 1mb" restriction on Bitmain's chain, legacy clients will refuse to see it as valid. The only way to make your client see that chain is to update to a compatible client.
However, there is no such incompatibility between the BIP148 chain and the legacy chain. If the BIP148 chain grows longer than the legacy chain, it will force the legacy clients to reorg onto the BIP148 chain.

Additionally, they won't be pre-mining 5000 bitcoin as other people in this thread claim. 
If their hardfork resets the difficulty calculation, they will be pre-mining 5000 of their new forked coin, which will be worth a lot less. Compared to most altcoins, it's a tiny pre-mine.
If their hardfork doesn't reset the difficulty calculation (there is no mention anywhere in the blog post about resetting difficultly, so who knows), they will only be pumping out 1-2 blocks per hour, and collecting only 1000-2000 bitcoin during those 3 days.
I'm not a fan of bitmain's plan here (not a fan of the UASF either). But it's not as crazy as many people in this thread are suggesting.
