As you mentioned in your original comment, there is a huge amount of risk but as we have seen in the past, the price can double, triple, 10x in even a year, or as we have seen recently lose 2/3 it's price. So it also depends on what you mean by independent, if you mean easily spendable with consistent value, then yes, USD is the better choice, but if you want a currency not controlled by a large, private institution than can create as much or as little as it wants \(look at the QE programs\), then Bitcoin is the way to go.

Guess what else is manipulated? Need a minute? I'll wait
Here is a hint: Every government issued currency!
The only difference is that Bitcoin may go up or down dramatically, but all government currencies approach no value over time. Over the last 20 years, USD has lost 33&amp; of it's value, over the last 50, its over 70&amp; Looking into the future, USD is expected to lose 2&amp; of it's value each year from inflation. McDonalds local to me recently raised their prices on their $1, $2 and $3 menu to the $1.50, $2.50 and $3.50 menu, I used to get a couple $1 and $2 items for lunch but instantly my lunch costs average 33&amp; more meaning my $5 today gets me what $3 would have gotten me a week ago. 
The dollar is going straight down while bitcoin rises and falls, over the last ten years though, the price has increased and more people are accepting it so long term, what has the better chance of not losing value?

You can do the math as to how much BTC was mined in the first year, and estimate the price based on that. Doesn’t have any practical application today though...

“Although we strive to provide continuous access to Coinbase services in all states in the US, Coinbase must indefinitely suspend its business in Hawaii.”
“We ask Hawaii customers to please:
Remove any digital currency balance from your Coinbase Account. Please note that you may remove digital currency from your Coinbase Account either by selling digital currency on the buy/sell page of your Coinbase Account (ordinary fees and restrictions apply), or by sending your digital currency to an alternate digital currency wallet;
 
Visit this page to close your Account.”
See quotes above from coinbase.com I think it sucks, not to be lol’d at.

As much bitcoin as you could find then would be your answer. There were no exchanges that I know of so that makes it difficult. In my state coinbase is illegal so I either have to buy it from friends with cash or on local bitcoins with cash.

Fiat currency is going to its true value of worthless but all of those are the value of currency relative to each other. Euro to USD exchange rate is down but so is USD to Yen is down. The dollar is strengthening and weakening to other currencies, not all the red means it’s becoming worth less, it’s just compared to other currencies. If you flipped all the symbols to USD/EUR instead of EUR/USD it will be positive.
