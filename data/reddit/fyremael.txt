That's a rather high horse you have there. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:29:36
I smell moral outrage. Perhaps it's the offal of that high horse you're on. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:16:10
And intolerable. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 08:59:23
Dogma shit.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:31:25
Bitcoin is not email.
@_date: 2016-03-02 14:53:23
Allegedly any non-core nodes.
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:42:42
Try living in the developing world where fees are very much a concern. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:20:23


Who defines "abuse"? You? Me? What if my definition differs? You do know what permissionless means right? If my txn gets mined then it's just as valid as any other. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:14:25
Oh those evil-doers. If you're not with us you're against us? 
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:35:54
Fear mongering? ROFL. Nice one. How about you refrain from telling me what or what not to do and I'll do the same. It is a genuine concern that I have since I happen to reside in the developing world and it is here that Bitcoin can provide the most benefits to the most people. A place where hardly anyone has two pennies to rub together let alone a bank account or a PayPal account. A place where poor people get gouged by money transmitters when sending their meager earnings back to their families. And I certainly do not require you to tell me what Bitcoin was designed for. I only care what Bitcoin can be used for.
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:50:50
A few pennies means a lot more to us in the developing world. A GLOBAL currency means taking everyone into account.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:58:10
I wouldn't know. Sock puppets are not really my thing. Now muppets on the other hand... Muppets are the shizz. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:55:15


Many of us don't have that option. That's why Bitcoin used to be so attractive. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:09:40
@_date: 2016-03-14 11:08:22


Perhaps you might want to listen to others that don't just echo your own beliefs. 
Actually listen. 
Without the ivory tower condescension. 
Without the "if you don't agree with us, you must be wearing tin-foil hats" comments. 
P.S. When are you going to stop making the ridiculous and pompous claim that "Bitcoin is Hashcash with inflation control"? 
@_date: 2016-03-08 09:04:55


Then let's see some code. Make it happen.
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:23:51
Non sequitur. I don't recall mentioning either. How about that Silk road eh?
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:29:32
It's not spam if it pays the fees. There are no velvet ropes here. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:12:30
Do you have the luxury of a bank account? A credit card? A PayPal account? If yes to any of those, you would be considered in the fortunate elite around these parts, and my early statements don't really apply to you. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:30:34
Not really discussing email here, but since you asked I'll humour you. The general rule of thumb (consensus?) is that if the email is unsolicited and from an unknown or misleading address and sent in large volumes it's probably spam. Others may have a different definition. The analogy is rather weak though when put in the Bitcoin context, so I'll leave it at that.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:10:40
This. Over and over again.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:30:22
Goblins, ghouls and things that go bump in the night. Shivers.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:25:55
If it pays it stays. Scale or die. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:02:53
No, this is: Biddy boddy boop. &lt;- Note the difference. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:28:53
Looks like your txn is now on the blockchain. 6+ confirmations as of this moment.
@_date: 2016-02-11 12:40:27


Unlike Blockstream? "Coup" and "take-over attempt" implies someone already holds power over Bitcoin. Now who could that be? 
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:19:51
Thank you for your concern. I'll let you know what's inside my own mind. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2016-02-23 09:52:59
Of course it's r/bitcoin. It's clear from all the [removed] posts.
@_date: 2016-02-17 12:28:01


I would suggest that Blockstream's goal is to OWN an Internet of Money ...
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:03:28
"... professionally ..." &lt;- Anyone with experience in subtle condescension knows exactly what this is.
@_date: 2016-02-24 09:09:13
As long as it's his way, and in his court. You think one thing, I think another. Fair enough. I prefer that we do not have a self-styled "King of Bitcoin". Not even the one who claims its invention was mostly his idea.
@_date: 2016-02-19 08:56:13
Clearly you don't live in the developing world. Good luck finding a working/efficient/inexpensive postal system in Africa. I wish it were otherwise.
@_date: 2016-02-19 09:24:38
Who do you think owns Blockstream? Farmers? Good grief.
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:25:12
Lol. Seems your panties are in a twist. I'm not sure if you even know what civil means (nor irony I imagine). Discussions also require an ability to speak thoughts without being censored by someone who only wants to hear one side. Note all the [removed] posts. Furthermore, I shall go wherever I like thank you very much. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:33:36


@_date: 2016-02-21 09:04:23
Nice logo. Bitcoin for Authoritarians^TM? *You will be our own bank*
@_date: 2016-02-24 09:04:16


What you don't know can't hurt you eh? I'd prefer to see all sides without obvious bias entering into moderation. But whatever floats your boat. 


Ah the smile and the dagger. Thank you kind sir. I am most humble to be in the presence of those with such courtesy and civility. Cheers :)
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:21:58
Yes, I agree. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:07:19
From his Twitter profile: 




Sure he may be a personable guy and good on him for inventing hashcash, but that's a bit much to swallow. I wish him well in his endeavours though perhaps the next time you spend a weekend with him, you could persuade him to listen to others besides the Blockstream/Core crowd. They are not the only ones with a stake in the future of Bitcoin. They are not the only ones with the answers.
@_date: 2016-02-18 10:07:58
I believe the transaction should get a higher priority assigned to it as it ages, increasing the probability of it getting included in a future block, even with zero fee. 
Edit: Googled and found this -  
@_date: 2016-02-24 09:11:51


Then you haven't been paying attention my friend. Context is everything.
@_date: 2016-02-23 09:32:41
Can this guy be any more patronizing?
@_date: 2016-02-18 10:20:51
This is all well and good, but how does our crafty bowlmaker ship his product to you?
