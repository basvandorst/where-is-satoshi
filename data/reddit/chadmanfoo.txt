You can withdraw, just not GBP. If you convert your balance to EUR first you can transfer via SEPA transfer.
Taken from the Coinbase website...
Due to bank servicing changes, we can no longer process GBP-denominated wire withdrawals from your account. As a result, we can no longer accept GBP deposits. Effective November 20, users with preexisting GBP balances on Coinbase may withdraw their funds via EUR SEPA transfers. We will process these withdrawals by converting your funds to EUR, then wiring EUR via SEPA to your GBP denominated account. Please carefully review further information about this process and applicable fees below.
Effective November 20, 2015, when you withdraw GBP from Coinbase we will perform a conversion to EUR and then wire you EUR via SEPA. A 0.1% plus €0.15 EUR fee will apply to all GBP withdrawals to cover bank foreign exchange and transfer fees. After submitting your GBP withdrawal order, we will show you the equivalent amount of EUR, based on the exchange rate Coinbase obtains directly from its bank, that we will wire to you, net of applicable fees. You may cancel the withdrawal at this time if you wish. Your bank may charge an additional fee to convert your funds back into your native currency. Please confirm the amount of this fee with your bank. Alternatively, your GBP balance can also be used to buy bitcoin. You can buy bitcoin with your balance here.
We are are working hard to restore native USD and GBP withdrawals as soon as possible. In the meantime, we are happy to answer any questions you may have. Support can be contacted here.
