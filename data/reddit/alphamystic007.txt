Thank you everyone, I have taken your advice and in some cases your exact words! Here is the email I sent to my CEO, I really hope it can be of some use to the community:
Dear XXX
Bitcoin represents a digital paradigm shift. For the first time in history we have a digital asset that can’t be digitally duplicated. So Bitcoin can be a currency, a store of wealth and cryptographic verification proof, it has many applications for many industries.
The volatility risk is real; however it is for high risk investors. A company like ours can accept Bitcoin through a 3rd party service provider to eliminate the volatility risk. Companies like BitPay and CoinBase convert instantly at market price so you have 0% volatility risk exposure, their fees to transfer the Dollars to your account are a fraction of typical credit card fees with greater security for both the vender and customer.
With Bitcoin we would reach new customers, assume no exchange volatility, transact with no fees, and integration is fast and easy.
It's a major trend, with little to no downside. There is no currency risk if we convert instantly to dollars and it lowers costs and allows a new method of payment. Dell, Overstock, Tiger Direct and others have accepted it and more are joining every day.
It is so much more than a currency, and the applications are much more than money based.
I would be happy to discuss this further, if you are interested.
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:56:39
there have been so many of these posts recently, that i have went from being a huge fan of coinbase to moving all my BTC onto trezor

This will also support the price of BTC by perfectly balancing  the downward sell pressure when a merchant immediately cashes out via Coinbase to fiat.

Can you smooth out the variance issue by paying out not as the rewards are mined but as a zero variance average?, thereby you would be riding out the variance rather than the miner, making your solution much more appealing. 
Your model could do this at no cost to you over time, apart from very short term gains and losses, with the right hedging and statistical analysis this would only need a pool of a certain size.
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:50:27

Coinbase rocks, i have talked tomsustomer service many times and they have been great every time. 
Your money is safer on coinbase if you are new to bitcoin than almost anywhere else. 
Have 2FA on your email and coinbase, you will only be able to access coinbase from your allowed devices, which you set up. This makes it extremly secure. You are far more likely to lose money with a paper wallet if you dont have lots of experience.

I just got the email about this.
**What security does the vault offer?**
Some security options the vault provides include:
Time delayed withdrawals: You can add a 48 hour delay to all vault withdrawals. During this period we will contact you using various communication channels to ensure you are the one who has approved the withdrawal.
 
Multiple approvers: Individuals and organizations can now jointly create vault accounts, with some combination of approvers (say 2 of 3, or 3 of 5) required to initiate a withdrawal. This greatly improves security since it requires multiple people to approve a withdrawal before it will be processed.
Offline Storage: Our vault uses the same “cold storage” technology that is used by 1.4M Coinbase customers today. This keeps up to 97% of bitcoin stored entirely offline, disconnected from the internet, in a geographically distributed set of private vaults and safe deposit boxes.
 
**“Multi-sig” technology for The Vault – Coming Soon**
To complete the Coinbase Vault offering, we will be adding multi-signature (“multi-Sig”) technology in the coming weeks to enable customers to manage their own vault security. The first iteration of the vault we completed uses the battle-tested offline storage technology we have in use today. We will release our multi-sig vault approach as well once it has been appropriately vetted by security teams both internally at Coinbase and externally.
**What is the cost of using a Coinbase vault?**
Coinbase vaults are free to use (just like our wallet product). Coinbase only charges a fee (1% or less based on volume) when customers buy or sell bitcoin, converting it to their local currency.
**When will the vault be available?**
We are rolling out the vault to 5% of customers today, with a general availability release targeted for July 16th.

You, as a prominent and hugely important member of this ecosystem, should do all you can to support the infrastructure.

I gave up paper wallets etc in favor of coinbase. That makes me an object of some ridicule here. But trust me its far safer, especially if you are not 100 percent clear what you are doing. If companies like coinbase cant make it safe to hold your bit coin with 2fa, and only accessing from known devces then all the super paranoid people will have great offline wallets worth nothing.

The delay is the transfer time from your bank to their bank, it is not for any other reason such as "establishing legitimacy". Its the same amount of time that it would take if you send me funds from your account to my account.
Note though, that once you are verified, have made a few purchases etc, you will be able to buy a certain amount of bitcoin INSTANTLY.
Right now i can buy $1000 worth of BTC immediately. Just get verified on all your info, use the site, and you will be verified too.

Bitcoin is a currency. We are dollar based company. I do not see why we should introduce additional currency risks by using Bitcoin. Fine banking fees are lower but volatility much higher.

Would like to understand how you see the additional value of such a platform for our company. Maybe I miss something.

i would be worried about having Coinbase for Android, which leaves you logged in constantly, plus Authy to verify sending of coins (you should certainly have this enabled) then on top of that adding some other app that gives you "price alerts". 
Opps there goes everything in your wallet.
I also wanted this functionality. But what I did was added it to another device (iPad) and get notifications on that where there is no BTC apps of any kind.

I think a lot of people may be a bit like me, in that when i first bought bitcoin i obsessed all day long about the price, then i bought more and more, soon i was spending a bit too much, and my price obsession just grew and grew. This wasn't helped by the fact that for the longest time i was losing money.
As i learned more and more about bitcoin, and pondered it again and again, hour after hour, day after day, something slowly creeped up on me. It was, what is now for me, a certainty that bitcoin is unstoppable really, that this thing isn't going to go away, and in fact its going to completely transform our world, humanity, nations and almost everything else in some way or other.. 
The world is about to be improved for billions of peoples. 
So now i only check the price once a day maybe less. Because it doesn't matter to me so much anymore. The price today is meaningless compared to the price in 5 years. So i have no need to worry or stress.
I sit here safe in the knowledge that the moon is coming, i have invested, i am using, i am ready. Its coming. Soon.

Hi Danny,
Thanks for being man enough to post on here, appreciate it. I invested 3.9 BTC, why did i lose all of it? 
I mean, surely when you saw it was failing you stopped spending right? Isn't there any left? I really could do with some percentage back?

Having 2FA on coinbase is not enough, you need to have it for your email also. Otherwise someone can request password resets etc
Its like securing the front door but leaving the back door wide open.

You need to find this keylogger, right now we are speculating. Lets get some facts. Install some more scanners, pay for some if u have too, find the culprit so we can warn others, we need to learn from this.

There are some tough questions being asked here, you seem to be avoiding them.

Not true, the ether will be used for executing the contract only, the funds can be in any thing you like, in this case bitcoin.
Think of it like the ether pays the miners to execute the contract, the contract says: "I will send this amount of BTC on this date....etc"
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:20:26
so what is correct?
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:44:15
Welcome, its crazy here. Crazy good fun.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:29:48
Ah yes, I actually meant how i can view how much i have in my wallet, not an address, as coinbase splits your wallet into many addresses

@_date: 2014-08-13 03:43:42
Its a threat, they have funds to attack bitcoin if they wanted, they could make bitcoin very volatile if they wanted too.
Bitcoin could also be held back until the foundation is effectively replaced and bitcoin starts to be developed at a similar speed to things like ethereum and mastecoin.
But the honey badger don't care.

Hi Mentors, 
I think my understanding of HD wallets is wrong somehow, can anyone point me in the right direction?
I am building a marketplace, there are sellers and buyers and we want to hold the funds in a HD wallet, we are using CoinKite right now.
Every time a new transaction is made we make a new address on our hot wallet in CoinKite, so we end up having lots of different addresses corresponding to each transaction that’s started.
However, when we are paying out after the transaction is complete we see that the money is taken from whatever UTXO is most appropriate to CKs algorithm, not in fact the UTXO of the output corresponding to that which is related to the transaction.
Bob pays 1BTC into escrow for a transaction involving Sally
Adam pays 1BTC into escrow for a transaction involving Eve
Bob &amp; Sally complete their business
The UTXO relating to Adam &amp; Eve is sent to Sally
This wasn't really what I wanted to happen, I was hoping that the "relevant" UTXO would be used instead, then I can show the users that money is available and waiting at the address they paid into.
I think I must have some fundamental thing missing, can anyone explain how it should be done?
    
@_date: 2015-07-08 04:19:10
Will escrow services need to be licensed?

Thanks, this is pretty useful. But I am not sure its relevant, this is a shared wallet, so in this case there would be 3 parties for a 2 of 3 wallet, but in my case there are only 2.
