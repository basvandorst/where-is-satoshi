Sure, but he got what, multiple life sentences? Meanwhile rapists and murderers don't always get even a single life sentence

So is it theft when the govt charges taxes and spends it on public education, infrastructure, and the military?
Do you know anybody that has never used health services in their lives? At what point does something make the cut for being worthwhile of being a public good?

I overheard some coworkers discussing it, and they said something along the lines of it being bad cause it makes crimes (drug dealing, etc) easier. I mean, maybe, but the almighty dollar is certainly used in relation to plenty of crimes too

Who keeps $50k in a savings account?

He says he has 49 Bitcoins. That's a lot of money, but I wouldn't say enough to retire on. Certainly not enough to use to buy a house and have any left over to retire on. So I think I'm correct in my assumption that he has income and intends to continue working after buying the house.
Also, it's not super hard to get a mortgage.

Interest rates are still incredibly low, so you're looking at paying a few percent to borrow money versus the potential BTC gain. I'm assuming you have a regular job, so imo it'd make more sense to just get a mortgage. Maybe use some of the BTC for a larger downpayment, and for move in stuff (furnishing, remodeling, etc).

It sounds like he doesn't have enough btc to retire on, so presumably he has income.
He'll have cash in the bank by only selling some of the bitcoin.
