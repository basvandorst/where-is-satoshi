My point/ concern: if it’s true that 2.2B in vapor $$ artificially inflated the entire market in Dec/Jan, then what’re the effects? 
@_date: 2018-05-26 18:35:02
True(ish). My utter contempt for the banking and mortgage industry has fueled my passion for crypto, so I guess my real question is this: can someone educate me on how we as a community can monitor the actual FIAT that enters the marketplace? 
I understand loosely how speculation influences the valuation of many of the companies behind many cryptocurrencies, but if the value of the coin/token is related to the FIAT investors use to support the crypto, then it’d be a good thing to know how much actual FIAT has entered the exchanges/ marketplace right? Am I misunderstanding something?

She’d definitely be resentful... until she got access to the $$$!!!

I don’t think you watched the video. Although interesting, they’re arguing liquidity issues. The OP is questioning how much actual FIAT fueled 2.2b “worth” of USDT. 
It’d be worrisome if thousands/millions of $$$ were converted into billions b/c no one can check.

Very constructive, ty.

True, I should’ve edited my OP, my point with the Wife was that if 1/10 of the world gets a little skin in the game THIS YEAR, then everything changes!

You have to read the article...

Haha!!! She is a lawyer :)

The story is about two Bloomberg articles sourced in the OP. “Zero evidence”, most of the 2nd Bloomberg source is about Tether?
Again, if 2.2b is inaccurate, then 1. How inaccurate? And 2. If and extra billion or so of USDT$$ helped fuel the rise in BTC value from $10k to 20k, then how much was the price helped and how could this affect the marketplace as a whole going forward?
@_date: 2018-05-26 17:22:51
Good points. I’m concerned with the “zero proof”, b/c if an independent audit of the FIAT backing Tether hasn’t happened then there’s zero proof that “real” FIAT fueled the winter boom/ has fueled the value of the entire market. Help me understand the logical fallacy pls?
@_date: 2018-05-26 17:12:29
But the criminal investigation was announced Thursday? If actual FIAT didn’t propel the winter boom then... that’s bad yes?
