�� no coiners are hilarious. Waiting for retracement, waiting for further retracement. You either believe in a world financial system no longer controlled by world banks or you don’t. Quit pussy footing around over a few bucks.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:43:16
Definitely and next will be the end of USD as the world trade currency
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:23:11
I do this as a way to take profits without converting directly to dollars. In Canada it’s easy silvergoldbull.ca accepts bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:08:57
Great idea deflate the value of your currency and screw over every hard working American who saves money... fiat is a scam folks
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:52:55
Trump talking about bitcoin is nothing but positive. America is concerned btc could replace their dollar as world trade currency.
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:51:06
Until another country can out muscle the U.S military their dollar will remain reserve currency ��‍♂️

Neither is Gold and Silver Bullion but every smart investor owns a good chunk of both.

Just another reason to get out of Fiat being back by the government isn't a good thing. Those pricks are the greediest of all

Exactly! If you start a new account, write down your entire key and shut the ledger off before finalizing you get a new key next time you attempt to make an account

Feel your pain, I’ve been buying small pieces of bitcoin for a year now and finally have a whole coin ��
@_date: 2018-10-28 17:20:21
Still buying weekly as well ��
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:21:29
A little but that doesn’t stop me from continuing to buy more. Bitcoin is a long term hold for me

@_date: 2019-08-04 21:03:40
I guess it depends on the price of electricity where you are from. Here it’s eight cents a kWh so four machines doing 56 TH burning 5000w would be profitable at today’s price but not by much. Think future price if we ever hit 100k plus but also consider difficulty increases in eight months too.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:14:02
I spend more on dinner it’s insignificant. Every no coiner in the history of btc “I’ll buy when it hits XXXX “ guess what they never buy

I’m with you on this one. I’m calling bullshit on his death, show us a body and autopsy report. About 16 months ago I tried to use quadrigacx and their exchange absolutely sucked. Very glad I never did business with these scam artists. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:16:48
So what your saying is someone stole your grandmother in-laws banking information and then used her bank account to purchase bitcoin? If you can see that they bought bitcoin via banking history you could attempt to contact whatever exchange they purchased the coins from explain the situation and maybe they can assist. But your storey sounds fishy and this is a breech in bank security really ��‍♂️

Not suprised. Made a few bucks off the pre fork pump. Dumped it all two days before the fork happened to watch BCH burn

Exactly �� each ath is followed by a sell off by earlier adopters. Coins spread thinner then before and once again reach a new ath. It’s a cycle that will continue indefinitely so long as adoption continues. Quit the woe is me fud and accept the process your time will come ��

Exactly look who proclaims bitcoin is dead every time, people who are rich with American dollars. The same slime that don’t want a financial system outside of government control. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:12:45
My father the smug man bought several bitcoin in early 2017, sold just after Christmas that year and is now buying back in too. With age comes wisdom 
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:08:11
Buy little pieces every week. Whatever you can afford. Slowly accumulate and price swings won’t matter so much in the long term. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:52:28
Prove it show us your sell order at ath ...

I’m with you �� I keep buying few hundred a week regardless of current price

Anyone who used credit to invest in crypto deserves their current fate. Never risk more then you can afford to lose

I’m sure you know this but if you don’t own the key to the wallet your funds are in you don’t truly own your funds. Get a ledger Nano s and don’t leave anything on an exchange you aren’t willing to lose
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:31:10
This was a good read a lot educated bitcoin holders on here. In theory the attack is possible but with the massive manufacturing issues and having to out pace everyone else in the world currently expanding their mining hardware it can’t happen. I just hope for all us btc folks someone tries one day...
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:03:24
Great answer
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:56:33
This is what makes Bitcoin a moon investment. As wealthy nations realize the value in a global currency and decide to buy in we price jump extremely fast only 21 million ever... Then early investors or traders sell marks get filled and then we retrace. The balance between people getting in and people getting out is what we call a market ��‍♂️ be grateful for ever large buying wall that retraces above previous level. More people are jumping in ��
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:50:59
Good thing everyone is now realizing BCH was and always will be a shit coin regardless of how many times they fork it

The laws of mathematics far supersede the laws of your country, that was once used as a dumping ground for European criminals. What’s next would you like gravity to be adjusted so it’s easier to carry around that thick skull? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:23:16
You can’t trust anyone rich with fiat when discussing a revolutionary currency that eliminates their ability to manipulate and control people.  
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:06:50
Also curious what everyone is using to go from fiat to crypto. I too have been using coinbase to gradually accumulate btc and Ethereum. Living in Canada 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:06:41
Being able to send currency globally without any hinderance has extreme value in today’s world.

@_date: 2018-12-11 15:22:03
Get your coins off exchanges folks. If you are new to crypto and haven’t had an exchange close from under you maybe you don’t understand. You will be left with nothing and they leave with everything! Buy yourself a cold storage wallet it’s worth the money! 
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:20:33
There is no fiat numbers because bitcoin is the new currency. I pay people in bitcoin, I purchase things with bitcoin. I use it as a currency whenever possible to whomever will accept it. Even before crypto I despised the world banking system purchasing gold, silver regularly since my early teens. Adoption starts with us so I spread btc everywhere 
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:03:17
Some of us are here for a change. We are sick of the current corrupt fiat financial system. You can’t shake us we’ll continue to accumulate and spread the word indefinitely and we will ultimately triumph. It is only a matter of time until people clue in to the cold hard fact that all fiat currency is simply a method of control and manipulation for governments.
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:06:16
May wanna fire it up and download all the new gadgets including ledger live. But I’d bet your funds are safe and sound I know mine are and I hardly ever plug my ledger in. I just send what I buy with fiat to my ledger wallets and forget about it ��
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:26:14
Fiat is a scam but unfortunately after a century of manipulation most people can’t see through it.
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:16:34
I like this guy, he gets it �� unfortunately 100 + years of banks manipulating a corrupt system leaves your average person completely unaware. Most people don’t understand money look how little they teach people about it in grade school ��‍♂️ fiat was designed as a way for governments to manipulate the masses with ease and it works
