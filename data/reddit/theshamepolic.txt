Everyone knows you can buy CP using bitcoin. But this time there are actula cp files and links in nodes. Basically if you own bitcoin you may be in possession of CP

So is everyone who mentions anything about CP being in the blockchain  going to get downvoted into oblivion.  Sorry guys it's truly over now. We will never get mainstream adoption thanks  to this news. The pump is simply whales milking their final profits from you guys.

I FOMO bought at 20k. I panic sold at 6k. I bought back at 11k. Am I the next Warren Buffet?

The normies are the ones that pumped btc. No sane normie will put money on something that has CP in it. The news is spreading like wildfire. The end is near and there is nothing you can do but cut your losses.

This is going to get out to the public eventually. And no one with a conscious will put a penny into bitcoin

I'm seriously not trolling. I used to be a very big supporter of Bitcoin until I heard of this news.
