Uh a lot actually. ALL of my friends have bought crypto in their phone because they don’t know how to create a hardware wallet like me. They wouldn’t listen before, now they’re trying to tell me lol.
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:43:05
Doesn’t mean no one would. 
I would for one. 
Phone wallets are second secure right after hardware, in most peoples opinion, and my source is from a thread posted not to long ago, what’s yours?
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:40:34
Yea most people but it’ll still have some people who do buy because it’s easier accessible.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:28:08
14 k by tomorrow morning? ��������������
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:30:59
Good fucking bot.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:04:38
Fuck you bitch ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:39:32
Makes sense.. 
I was just thinking, if I buy 50 now it’ll be worth less then if I buy 50 tomorrow possibly. 
I also want to put a large amount in soon. 
Thank you for explaining. I appreciate it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:16:50
Hmm.. when I compare to google it always seems different. I thought this was one just updating faster then the other. 
What is this HODL app?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:30:44
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:27:11
Don’t believe this bullshit.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:19:22
I have no idea but I think they do have a fee of some sort. When I bought $50 and $150 it charged the amount plus .24 cents. 
I haven’t seen any downsides yet
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:18:21
Ahhh gotcha haha.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:42:12
I’m thinking we’ll be at 20 k by the end of August. 
I could be wrong but I have alerts set to sell all my coin at 100% profit if something like that happens.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:24:32
Cash app is better.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:23:37
Me too :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:23:09
Dude what the fuck are you saying ?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:36:54
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:42:28
I doubt it would go anywhere below 7k
I could be wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:03:51
I like cash app
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:36:07
I’ve already made $150 profit, my friend got a 100% return on $500. 
And I already sell weed nigga. I’m not looking for a quick flip.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:36:42
Could you elaborate as to what DCA means? I come here every so often but not enough to know acronyms.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:21:48
Coin base has alerts that’ll tell you how much it goes up or down if it’s wild. I just got the -12.7% drop alert and put in $150 more.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:46:06
Dyor? 
Hodl? 
Calling bot. Ignore this.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:58:19
I know it can go down quick. That’s why I have alerts to sell if it goes down faster then I can make a decision on what I want to do.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:26:47
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:43:03
Thank you. Im gonna go along with DCA after an initial bigger purchase.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:23:34
I was about to say holy fuck im pissed. ���� thanks anyways tho!
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:20:43
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:03:01
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:21:23
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:17:42
Thanks so much. I just verified myself and am thinking of buying 250$ worth.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:20:08
Is there any catch? Like a large fee or something? 
It seems to good to be true. So easy to buy.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:12:24
Me too
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:50:35
Is it better to make a PC wallet and buy bitcoin and send it to the wallet? 
Does mobile have any downsides?
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:49:05
What is KYC? 
I’m gonna make a bitcoin wallet on my PC, try to make it secure as possibke and buy off a website instead
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:53:58
Thank you for explaining.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:11:41
So it’s not a bad thing to use cash app? I guess what I’m asking is, is there better things then cash app.. 
Also how does an offline wallet work, is it you have .1 BTC so however much that is, that’s what you have, instead of having 250$ worth of BTC in as of today but tomorrow it could be worth more?
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:10:20
I’m buying today also. Why later today tho? I’ve been constantly refreshing and it’s went from 7700-7900, right now being 7846.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:22:54
Makes it twice as rare as before. 
Rarity is $$$
