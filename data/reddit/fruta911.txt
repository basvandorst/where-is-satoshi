For merchants
I think mtgox would be fine for you bussiness... to cashout etc.. but you still have the leading bitcoin merchant solution 
I never tried bit-pay tho.

why do you have to always spam with your faggot articles? I mean.. you just rip off content from the main bitcoin forum and add it to your blog.
At least grab a bitcoin domain related for your blog.

lets be real. These bitinstant guys only got rich because of their high fees, and good press on silkroad forums.
