That's not describing your experience. You used present tense and you are therefore implying that nothing has changed.

Keep defending BTC lmfao. It's not viable for small transactions, that's it. I provided anecdotal evidence and an international view on it yet you seem too keen on my grandma's sex life.

There are 100+ countries outside of the US. Stop thinking about just the US if you want BTC to succeed as anything except an asset. VISA also has millions of customers outside of the US.      
I have bought candy worth 5 INR (0.078USD) using my debit card because my local store doesn't set a minimum purchase amount.  
I also regularly pay for bus tickets worth 10INR and train tickets worth 30 INR with my debit card. Yes, I am charged 2% more because the tickets are sold at a loss and they can't afford the debit/credit card commision so they charge 2% more.  
But I don't think BTC will be competitive with VISA anytime soon with this attitude. India might be a "shithole" but it is a big market for MasterCard, Visa and Discover.  
With those transaction fees, you might be competitive with VISA in the US, but VISA gets enough revenue from outside the US too.  
Also, BTC just doesn't have VISA to compete with. China, Japan, India and a lot of European countries have domestic debit cards with lower commision rates than VISA/MasterCard.  
BTC has a long way to go..

The fact that you consider my comment as an attack shows how insecure you are lmfao.  
Keep dreaming about competing with Visa while ignoring everything outside of your small little world.  
It's funny how you people only think of countries outside of US when the FUD spreads and affects the prices lol.

It's hypocritical really. You're accusing me of nationalism yet defending BTC like it's your country or something.    
Criticizing BTC is also "talking" about it.  
Your replies to my comment just proves the point of that comment.
