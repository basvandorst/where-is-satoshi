He mentions that he invested in an IRA...I've been wondering how to do this for a while now. 
Obviously you can purchase GBTC in your retirement accounts but is there something that allows you to hold the actual assets?  Even the host mentions how of course he found a smart tax way to invest.

If bitcoin is not for me, then it isn't for 99% of the world's population....at least as it is right now.  Everyone is saying how Bitcoin is great for developing countries and places like Zimbabwe but my goodness, what is the practicality that the people in those countries can actually understand this complicated technology?

I have a pretty good CPA and book keeper already and I bet neither of them would really know what to do in this situation.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:01:55
I do have an accountant.  I'm not sure how much they know about crypto though.  The thing you learn about accountants and taxes is that everyone has a different opinion....our tax code is so retarded

Nope, my buddies are doing the day trading game.  I'm holding for at least 1 year to at the least save myself 19% on taxes by having a long position.  
I'm strictly interested so hopefully I can stop monitoring the market every 30 mins and put some limits on how often I touch my phone.  I'm just curious how the wave of cryptocurrency is moving across the planet.

Yeah my buddy made like $400k on AMD last year and then shorted another stock and lost $400k in Jan of this year.
He has to pay capital gains tax on the $400k from 2016 (which he now doesn't have) and with the $400k he lost this year he can only write off $3000.  So basically he has 133 years of maxing out his $3000 loss. 
Moral of the story, don't fuck up investing if you don't know exactly what you are doing.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:54:00
Remind me what the lower capital gains tax is?  Is it 15 or 20%?  And that's regardless of what your effective tax rate is on your payroll income right?  That's not horrible but still frustrating 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:06:08
Ah see you took it too far and totally butchered it!
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:19:44
Minimum?  That can't possibly be true right?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:29:05
That not what I'm looking to do...I want to see my portfolio growth and not have to enter numbers in every time I check it.  Delta seems to be the answer 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:40
That's really the best option.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:25:55
That is too manual.  I want something that keeps up with it all the time.  I just downloaded Delta and Blockfolio which does exactly what I was hoping.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:17:47
Which chart do you recommend? I got off Coinbase and monitor with Delta but have gdax open all day on my workstation.  I have to say, Delta's charts are less easy to read than Coinbase.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:25:15
I'm not exactly sure what that means.  I'm about to move my coins from Coinbase to my ledger nano.  Does each buy and sell have a public key?  Still trying to learn all this terminology

Reminds me of my best friend who was cleaning out his car before he sold it to his now wife.  He checked the back passengers magazine storage area and found a bank envelop with $8000 in it.  He forgot he hid it there years before when he was considering buying a new car.  I think he sold the car to his gf at the time for $6000.  She almost got the car for free!
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:31:17
I would say the opposite actually.  All my friends hate me talking about bitcoin but I also am closer to my friends who joined in with me.
I don't personally think crypto is a Ponzi scheme (it can't possibly be based on the def of Pomzi schemes) but I do have to say, having experienced my own parents and my high school friends fall for these pyramid schemes, it makes me really watch my own mouth and conversations because I know how annoying "those" types of people can be.  
In many ways it's best to just keep it to yourself and enjoy the ride you are on...much like religion, politics, and acid.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:12:41
See this is the mentality you can't have...you need to Hodl even if it goes below what you bought in at.  There is a good chance it will drop below $10k or even $5k but you gotta weather the storm.  Same thing happened in 2008 and if you sold to minimize your loss then your realized real losses but if you held, then you made great gains the next 10 years.  Granted it took about 3-5 years to rebound but it was a good investment.

I'm in the US and I think all I needed was a photo of my ID for Coinbase.  I know I didn't do anything with mail or taxes or other proofs of income like I did when I had to buy a house.

Let's talk the real story here....investing in BTC in a Roth IRA!  How can you actually do this and would there be fees for doing so?  I used to own GBTC which technically could be bought in a retirement fund but anyone who knows about that ETF will say it's not the best use of money for Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:16:20
But let's say I decide not to offer s money back guarantee.  Is there any obligation to return the money?
Say your son racks up in app purchases in a video game.  Or a rental car company in Mexico charges you a bullshit damage charge that you notice once you return home.  
Chargebacks and disputes are a huge park of traditional banking.  Curious how that would work 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:23:29
Just got Delta and Blockfolio.  I like the look of Delta the best but I'll test run them both for a week.  Thanks

I use PayPal exclusively for my payment processor.  What sucks as a seller is a buyer can dispute a charge with their bank and almost 100% of the time PayPal will side with the bank.  If I had a mailed receipt showing that goods were sent to the buyer I might be able to contest the chargeback.  With digital products it's much harder and I constantly have $100s of dollars removed from my account every couple days.  
On another instance, my boat club started charging my credit card on file $100 a month more than the fee was supposed to be.  The owner of the club gave me some BS excuse and wasn't helping so I called my bank and said these charges were not the amount agreed up in my contract with the club.  After a few weeks of investigating, the bank gave me back all the overage fees.
What I'm not sure makes sense with blockchain technology is how can buyers and sellers have accountability for returns or over charges if there is no middle man?

I'm with fidelity already but the idea of the Roth is your gains can grow tax free.  Otherwise they will be taxed at either your effective tax rate when you withdraw or 20% for long term gains (maybe 15% depending on the laws).  So if you pay 12% you are almost throwing all the tax benefit away to have your IRA stored somewhere that isn't as common as say Fidelity.  
Do the fees remain 12% or just for the initial setup?
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:18:19
I have a basic question about the whole idea of bitcoin based on this.  If mining is too expensive now and is only being done but bit multi million or billion dollar companies, does that defeat the decentralized idea BItcoin is based on?  
If you can't be rewarded easily or well through mining and rendering transactions, then why would people still buy into the system?  If say Amazon does most of the mining because they have the best servers, isn't that a potential problem for bitcoin in its decentralized argument?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:27:06
How will they know though?  Besides reviews there is no credit rating or anything.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:16:35
Able to explain how this works?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:46:31
Let's just hope the cows come home!
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:25:59
Wow 12% in fees is crazy!  Do you think you could pay to have them setup the account and have the fees apply to a smaller amount and then add funds later?  I'm not eligible to contribute to my Roth at the moment but I have about $70k in there and I def don't want to pay $7k in fees.  But if they could roll over $1000 and then I could roll the rest over after the setup that might be worth it.

I don't make 5 figure incomes so there is no way I could pay zero in taxes.  For the average person, they are too under the radar to ever get audited by the IRS.  If Mitt Romney and Donald Trump are paying at least 15% in taxes I think you better reevaluate your idea that you can easily pay zero in taxes.

This so does not look legit.  What kind of website is that?
