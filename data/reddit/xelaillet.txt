Cash is damn expensive to handle.

Please do so! :)

Yeah I'm running Windows Server simply for ease of use. I'm sort of familiar with Linux, but would rather stick with Windows.

What alternatives are there for Windows? I'm currently running Bitcoin Core with about 80 connections, but I would consider switching to another implementation if it works just as well and it would benefit the community as a whole.

You do realize, that you don't need to have a Fidor bank account to trade on Kraken, right? 
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:39:05
That makes no sense (unless you are actually talking about trading). 
You start with 100 USD and buy say 1 BTC. You wait and the price of BTC against USD goes up, so now you can get 200 USD for your 1 BTC. But if you want to buy BTC again, you can still only get 1 BTC, unless the price of BTC has decreased after you sold yours. 
So why would you sell and then rebuy?

No, mining (facilitating the transactions) gives a transaction fee to the miners (no new bitcoin created, only bitcoin moved from one owner to another) and also a block reward (new bitcoin created). eBay will probably not mine themselves, thus they will receive neither the transaction fee nor the block reward. However, they may still impose payment fees on top of the transaction fee, but that will not create new bitcoin, only move them from the buyer to eBay.

Hi John, sort of unrelated. Do you know when Skyhook is going to support Danish kroner (DKK)?

"[...] and people are founding companies to buy up lots of bitcoins. But as it is designed to a limited amount ever in circulation, that might cause problems down the road [...]"
Why exactly is that a problem?

It's impossible to know if the deal you get will be good or bad in the long run. However, you can always go to  and check out the current average of the price on a number of online exchanges. That way you'll know if the local trader deal is good or bad in the short run.

If I'm not mistaken, in most/all cases the EU general advocate gives his recommendation as to what the ruling should be and usually the EU court judges follow this recommendation.
