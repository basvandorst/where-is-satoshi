As much as the price falling off bitcoin stings a bit, I think that a ton of people were scolded to death by their fixation on some of the alts.

I think that most of the banks are playing games connected to their terms and conditions but the general policy has been reasonably neutral.  Don't get me wrong, their main aim to date has been raising FUD but I have seen a few posts where they talking about protecting their customers interests and that the bitcoin industry is unregulated.  As far as I know there has been no explicit threat or denial of service.   There have been disputed transactions which may or may not been directly related to bitcoin exchange accounts.

Without a hint of FUD, it certainly is under attack but it is to be expected and not a real problem in the long run.
 
You have to see it from the banks/Gov perspective.  They perfectly understand the threat that Bitcoin projects. The banking system is a big fucking milking machine. Guess who the cows are?  If the unholy idea catches on that a person does not necessarily have to store their money with the banks it would upset the entire system to an indescribable degree.  
 They will start fighting back in stages. The first stage is FUD and smear (money laundering, etc). The next stage is lobbying government.  Then active non co-opporation with exchanges and other on and off ramps. . Then anti-Bitcoin regulatory laws and practices.  Then... what?  Acceptance.   Why? Because Bitcoin can't actually be controlled.  That is the actual design.  It can be punched and kicked, it will sometimes drop in value because of bad actors and tactics, but crypto views all that as stress testing. The truth about revolution is that it can get ugly and messy, but if it can't deal with heat it will not get through at all.  Some people will drop in and out because, as said, Bitcoin is people not institutions.   Institutions will definitely try to tame it, to control it. They will fail.
I'm very positive about crypto, we just need to relax about share price.  Invest what you can afford and if you are chasing guaranteed safe returns buy some government bonds instead and wait for 25 years.

No offense taken or intended.  For my part there are many things I still don't understand.  As an example I don't know how the altcoin thing will pan out, but competition is always  a good thing.   I'm also pretty sure that Bitcoin as we see it now will probably not be it's final form.  I have no idea what form it may take but it will be interesting.  
Or perhaps it will keep evolving through a never-ending series of soft forks, constantly improving.  Or perhaps it will die?   There are few guarantees in life.

Why do you need a 4 carat diamond engagement ring for?.  Ever go down to the store and say, "I want a doz eggs and a bottle of milk.  Please chip the price off my 4 carat diamond engagement ring".
You have to pick the actual arrangement you want to have with us.  If it is "store of value" then bitcoin is vastly superior to that of gold.  Bitcoin has proven that is is a store of value (obviously fluctuations aside).  It also is easily transferable, I could fly to France tomorrow and cash out spending money in Bitcoin easily.  You may be able to fly to France  with a diamond engagement ring or a solid gold bar but good luck cashing those out without a major financial headache.   
You seem to have trouble getting your head around the digital nature of crypto.  Yet you spend digital currency every single day.  The more you insist that digital currency is "nothing" then the harder it is for you to understand.  By your terms then the Internet is "nothing".  The internet is not physical and therefore has no value.  Yet here you are tapping away on a keyboard communicating on "nothing".

Gold is not at all rare... there is plenty of it, in fact, for the past 50 years governments have been getting rid of the gold stocks that they USED to have.  And if we are talking rare let's talk Bitcoin.  There is only going to be 21 million Bitcoin - ever - and the last coin won't be found for over a hundred years.  
As for diamonds, you are talking about a public relations scam from a hundred years ago.  Also, you can always mine more whenever you want it and whenever the price makes it affordable to do so. We know where it is, when we want more we can get it.  Gold is not that rare.  Pttft, the universe?  There are most likely planets made out of the stuff.  
Diamonds are not naturally rare either, but they are controlled by a centralized authority and are artificially made to be rare.    In fact, The price of diamonds is dropping because you can make that shit in factories nowadays and the new generations are not as interested in spending a fortune on tiny pieces of crystallized rock.

As for converting bitcoin back into hard currency occasionally proves that it doesn't "work" - what? Bitcoin doesn't replace the need for banks, it just takes away their power to dictate every aspect of how your money is used.

What, compared to fiat?  A greenback is only worth 13% of the purchasing value it had in 1959 and it is getting less every year.  Bitcoin is deflationary which means that what is in your pocket has more value every year. If you are arguing that centralized banking system  being superior, well that billygoat died for real in 2007/2008. The lie was exposed for the whole world to see.  Banks gave birth to Bitcoin, they are just too greedy and moribund to know it.

Thanks for all the responses.  
I am trying to weigh the oft repeated claim (by certain factions) that the coin's true value is dependent upon it's transaction speed and cost.  If this is true, obviously Bitcoin is not the best (leaving aside all other virtues).  If so, then the quickest and cheapest altcoin will eventually move into the prime position via time and evolution?  
Once mass adoption takes place the crypto world will be forced to move beyond the current "Coke-Pepsi" paradigm by market forces and no amount of sponsorship (or propaganda) on either side will be as effective.   You know, money talks, bullshit walks.
However, as other smarter people have said before me, there are other prime values for any crypto, and transaction speed and cost may not be the prime forces that are assumed.  Or possibly they are?  
I'm pro-bitcoin, but agnostic as to the middle to distant future.  I happen to think that no current coin will probably be around in 20 years time and things will slowly evolve into products we are unable to conceptualize right now.  The originating principals will still be around, but the products may look and feel like something else entirely.  
Or... possibly there is a happy place for all coins as they fold into their distinct roles.  Be it a holder of value? Maybe a small scale transactor, and also  large scale transactor for a different coin. And then another crypto vehicle for smart contracts and so forth?  
Lemme know what ya think about those propositions?

One thing, while the BTC wallet app opens first go, some of the alt coin apps that it supports are a bit spotty, and sometimes fails to open (Ripple, LTC).  I will spend some time later trying to understand the bug, and it appears to be a fairly common occurrence with alt-coins on ledger.  The BTC wallet fires up every time tho.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:49:54
Some coins are suitable for value storage, some are more suitable for small scale transactions, some for very large transactions and some for smart contracts and the list goes on.
Some coins will be in direct competition with each other, but most cryptos solve particular problems.  No single coin is the answer to everything.

If you live in China and trade bitcoin it will be interesting times, but they have already tried to ban ICOs and regulate crypto exchanges and have largely failed.  The coins just moved en-mass out of Mainland China and bitcoin corrected soon afterwards.
I don't want to play down legitimate fears, and governments can cause a lot of trouble, but it was for this reason that bitcoin was created.  While governments can screw around with the on and off-ramps, they will have a hard time locking down encrypted P2P transactions.

We are in the phase of acquiring coin. In time the infrastructure will follow.  We had the car a long time before we had highways and gass stations.

Yep, but the Chinese miners fear losing money more than they fear their own government.  Witness the failed September crackdown.

You don't lose even a fucking red cent if you don't cash out.  Selling in a bear market is how you lose money.  
That is true for us minnows anyway.

I am more than happy to supply any answers to any of your questions (if I can, for I am not an expert).   It is difficult to get your head around.  I studied and researched all I could for five months before getting into it.  That was a difficult period for me.
You have to understand that seeking information is a lot different from telling us that we are all blockheads for believing in magic internet money.  This happens every day and while challenge is a good thing, this is not a cult. If you stick around you will see the discussions can be quite sophisticated and even those of us who are really interested sometimes struggle with concepts and tech advances. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:43:08
Yeah, the "hodling" thing can get annoying but it is a very simple trick to avoid getting burnt if you suck at technical analysis.   
I think that BTC hasn't even begun it's climb due to the fact that mass adoption is still quite a bit away. It's market cap is nowhere even close to that of Apple Corp (for instance). If you are an early adopter you have a lot of information at hand and you tend to dismiss all positive predictions as hype. Or, if a complete noob, you keep switching from lambos to FUD at every twitch in the market or on hearing any comment on Fox news.   
This was the first dip where i didn't even flinch  because I knew that regular 30+% nosedives in bitcoin is the proven crypto measure to prevent a real bubble. Whales, bad press, insider trading, dirty exchanges  and bad actors all play a part in the game...
...but moneybadger don't care. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:56:13
Is it economical? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:35:17
Nope, it is dead easy converting ordinary cash into ordinary wire transfers.  You don't need bitcoin, and in fact, Bitcoin is not as anonymous as you might think on account of it being publicly listed on the open ledger.  Law enforcement have had an easy time of it tracking every transaction because bad guys write their seeds on notebooks and such.  Or print out paper wallets and leave them on the nightstand.  Hard to believe, but they are not master criminals, just ordinary people and do stupid things like you, me and the guy next door.  
And another thing - criminals use cell phones, cars, passports and banks as part of their offending methodologies too.  Should we ban all those or is it just crypto that has your panties in a bunch?  
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:41:17
Crypto can be cashed out in any country, my friend.   You own your own money and you own your own account.  
That is the entire point. Banks and Governments can't freeze shit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:46:45
Nothing wrong with bcash per say. The toxic commentary from him is another thing.
 But brutal negativity is a much needed stress test for Bitcoin. If it can't handle such attacks it will surely go under as r/btc sez about every 5 seconds.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:59:30
It's obvious that you don't know what it's for, but at least you are trying to understand.  Have you ever asked any of us idiots why was are buying it?
I'll answer even if not asked.
1.  Because I believe in the technology and want to support it.
2. Because I don't trust the banking system nor believe that Governments are very trustworthy with regulating my own money.
3. Because governments pay bills by printing more money and that is inflationary.  
4. Because I want to invest in an appreciable asset. 
5. So that when I am in my retiring years I can be comfortable and harvest my investment as I need it.
6 Because I don't live in North Korea and I'm a goddamned adult and don't see why I need anybody's permission to spend my own money as I see fit.  
A lot of this anti-crypto hysteria is insulting.  I think that buying a boat is a waste of time and money but I have no trouble not running around yelling at people not to buy boats.  Buy two boats for all I care.  Knock yourself out.  Buy three if they make you happy.
Don't justify your life choices to me.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:04:55
Exactly.  Paper money isn't real either. What reality is does have is derived from a shared agreement of value. In prison, cigarettes are money.  The idea that bitcoin is only numbers and therefore has no value was silly nine years ago and now as it is only getting stronger by the week the argument that it had no value is getting tired. (Yes, sometimes it falls, but the track is obvious).

This statement was brought to you by Fox News.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:17:45
Nope, it was an attack alright, just not one thought out very well. It is an example of the law of unintended consequences. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:53:53
That's EXACTLY what one of "them" would say!
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:29:13
That statement only makes sense if you are American?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:04:26
I've had exactly one of those conversations from a friend who plays the regular market with some success.  
His attitude was extremely patronizing, but also one of concern.  He rolled out the usual argument that he had picked up in the mainstream press that the blockchain was freaking wondrous but bitcoin was a dud.  I tried to explain that you can't separate one from the other, that the blockchain is incentivized by crypto.  Otherwise, the miners wouldn't enable transactions unless they were paid.  He didn't get it, so I changed the subject.  That is my last attempt to argue all things bitcoin.  They will have to learn the hard way, which is what they are wishing on us.
People are so damn sure about stuff they don't understand.

Diamonds are an excellent example of a largly worthless rock having agreed value. It does have a good industrial use, but is cheap in that form. And gold is not at all rare and it's agreed value is based upon its stability as storage.

This isn t even the same galaxy as mainstream just yet. You know it is when soccer-moms start giving crypto coin tips.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:27:38
I agree that rare things are rare.  
I read an interesting thing about gold that fascinates me. 
If you were a wealthy Roman citizen about 2000 years ago a troy ounce of gold would buy you a stunning formal toga and sandals.  If you were a rich Victorian Gentleman in about 1890 a troy ounce of gold would buy you a decent dinner outfit.   If you were to cash in a troy ounce of gold today ($1320) you could buy yourself a very nice suit.  See, the true value of gold is its '"stability" not its increasing value.  Gold is gold because its dependable.  Bitcoin has yet to reach that stage.  It is volatile as hell.  In time though... in time....?
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:17:05
There would be exchanges and banks all over the world happy and eager to accommodate your accounts.  Bitcoin is not American anymore, and the only losers would be corporate USA. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:18:25
Europe would fall over themselves opening banks catering to bitcoin customers if the US banned crypto.  Moneybadger don't care.

As if regulation is the answer to life's problems?   Wall Street was in a highly regulatory framework when they traded toxic mortgages in 2007 and destroyed the entire world's economy.  Your regulatory framework is still causing damage. What's bitcoin doing? Pretty much standing in the corner giving people a bit of control and minding it's own business while the system is set on attacking it.  
Get your own house in order.

Yeah... Segwit doesn't alter the protocol, it is built on top of it. As to the weakening bit, bcash did it's damnest to attack BTC and failed.

I've never understood the biblical old testament nature of bcash's argument anyway. What has writ in a white PAPER 10 years ago can never be changed?  No further technological developments or improvements over time? WTF?

I think that a correction is coming, it always does sooner or later.  That said, this bitcoin badboy is going to be plied on by the entire globe for a few weeks, so the dip is at least a couple of weeks away.  I could be wrong.

I don't get it either, but as the Australian Financial  Review is (more or less) a corporate trade rag published by Murdoch, the story probably relates to all botcoins are involved in drugs and murder. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:21:20
Bought in early 2017, plan on revisiting it in about eight years time. Until then I couldn't care less what btc does in any given day, week, month or year. Unless you go long there is way too much drama in crypto.
If in 8 years time it is worth zilch, well, it will be just another Tuesday. On the other hand, if it worth a gallzillion, OK, lucky me. 
 In the meantime, meh...! 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:01:09
They always throw in "expert" predictions on bitcoin.  
Where the fuck are these expert creatures?  I'd like to meet one.  
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:06:42
There was no "just happened" about it. Bcash was pumped just three hours before he went on.  This was deliberate.  
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:10:45
I'd say that the devoted followers of bcash and the devoted followers of that particular show are not mainstream.  
The first group hold as much bcash as they can afford already, and the second group have never even heard of the internet. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:13:02
Roger is working incredibly hard at not flipping his lid whenever somebody calls in 'bcash".   I wish I could see the visible ticks under his eyelid when that happens.

Fraud is not possible with open source systems as under discussion.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:39:24
No fraud in an unregulated market.  Still a dumb idea tho.
@_date: 2018-07-26 03:44:30
You will have to quote a definitive example of where it is occurring in the crypto space because empty definitions are meaningless.
 If you are talking exchanges, you may be right because they fall under regular commercial practices, but crypto itself is open source.  I could copy the code, create a "new coin" and claim what I like.  That is exactly what bcash did. Nothing fraudulent under open source.
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:32:41
There is not a lot that I can disagree with here...
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:21:36
I wondered about this too.  I think that the shows producers filtered the calls for the drama.  I would think that 10,000 fanboys would have TRIED to get through in order to give Ver and bcash a very public handjob.  
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:56:29
Unless you sell, you haven't lost a cent.  
@_date: 2018-07-02 08:11:27
You may be right as you are probably an expert at retarded things to say.  Perhaps I can explain further.
If your focus is fiat prices, by all means get all sad despondent.   If you are happy to wait five to ten years for the tech to develop things will probably be in a happy place.  
In any case, not investing more than you can afford to lose is a real thing and something that too many people only pay lip service too.   
@_date: 2018-07-02 08:06:50
That's very true.  Which is why I don't worry about prices either way. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:16:41
I just ignore them and take advantage of the sale price. Bought another .25 btc today. Just adds to the pile. Well on my way to my second coin now. They can depress the market as long as they like. Bitcoin is growing behind the scenes and i wanna buy cheap.
