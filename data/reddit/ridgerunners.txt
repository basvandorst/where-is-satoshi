I have two ledger nanos’s and have never had a problem with either of them. I would recommend them along with with the Ledger live desktop UI

I had the exact same experience with Dave at Wallet Recovery Service. He never gave up even though I had. One day out of the blue, I get the same email you are describing, saying he had recovered my coins! Dave is an absolute professional and a highly trustworthy individual!!

I’ve  been using Coinbase for years and have never encountered a 30 day hold period. Maybe different countries have different regulations. I have never made a purchase using a BTC ATM, but I believe you are correct to assume that the coins will be available to you immediately.

+1 for the hardware wallet. I personally use  ledgers and I would never go back to paper wallets or any other solution. It’s just absolutely worth the  money for the peace of mind in knowing your investment is safe, not to mention the convenience they provide. The new Ledger Live UI is a nice way to aggregate all your coins in one easy to see platform, allowing you to watch your investments grow

Localbitcoins.com is good.

Where is this one?

Can’t you just sell the BTC on Coinbase and deposit the fiat back into your bank account?

You could try to find your nearest crypto ATM . Localbitcoins could work too.

Are you implying that an international company such as Coinbase, which was recently valued in the billions, has less overhead than someone operating this BTC ATM?

You don’t say....

Just the simple fact that you have the foresight to not only save, but invest in something, regardless of what it is, shows a great deal of responsibility for someone your age. If you continue with that kind of financial awareness and self control, you will end up far better off than the majority of your peers. Great job! Keep tucking away a little each month, and let the power of compounding do its thing.

If it sounds too good to be true....it probably is. Seems pretty shady. Why would he sell them to you so cheap if the average market price is 11-12% higher?
