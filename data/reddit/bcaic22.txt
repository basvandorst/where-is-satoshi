Hi there,
The ebay issue I've already explained and I opened up the device as well to make sure its a legit one - like the one my friend got around the same time from the manufacturer and guess what; they matched! What a miracle right... 
You're right! - Not everything can be proven online with screen shots - which makes theft like this even more easy to get away with, and leaves disbelievers even more vulnerable for their own robbing at some point. 
As far as losing empathy for me goes, the post isn't intended to be a sob story. It's intended to warn others of possibility that could come their way at some point. Even though many stupidly think it's not possible for it to happen to them. - Lawsuits are always a threat, and always possible, ever see any of the things that people have sued for in the past?? - 
As far as them only stealing bitcoins goes (which I'm glad I didn't lose here); they probably will and have at some point. I just happened to not have it on there. I doubt they're able to pick and choose which coins on which wallets from those with "large amounts" to steal, at least not yet. ANY coin being stolen is a gain for a thief... does it really matter to them if they get them all for free?? They can still be sold right??
Final thought; what kind of mind says "bitch pleeease" and expects to be taken seriously?
I do appreciate your reply and input

No, it didn't happen to my friend. I  only mentioned that my friend bought the same wallet from the manufacturer and we had the same wallet. Since some people seem to think I got scammed because of where I  bought it from - which isn't the case here.

Hi there,
Didn't save anyone from anything. Only made others think that the post is bullshit.
This is like reading a book review of one person that didn't like the book and gave it low rating and then skipping the book, even though the book may have been great for you. The power of the internet haha

Yup that's true! 
Luckily I didn't
