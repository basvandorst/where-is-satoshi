That is your personal opinion.
The fact that the instant conversion to BTC from the payment currency used in the transaction makes it a bitcoin card. Your spending or purchasing power is directly impacted by the BTC price, BTC goes up relative to the currency you are purchasing in you can afford more. It is not mutually exclusive, have a wallet, have a spending card denominated in bitcoin, do whatever you want.

You are wrong sir. Bitstamp Bitcoin Exchange Increases AML (Anti Money Laundering) Policy by Asking Customers More Detailed Questions Check it out! Sorry friend.

Yes, quite interesting huh.
Not a lot of money really, those who have an interest in changing BitLicense law surely have deeper pockets than that.
There has to be a way though to improve nascent regulation, nothing is final there.
