No its' not.  You're being silly.   Lightning doesn't require Segwit and Segwit doesn't even give you a double increase.  I don't mind Segwit but no one trusts core to EVER increase the block size.    
This whole battle is about BlockStream wanting high transaction fees.

If you connect to every single node in the network, which is easy to do, and they all tell you the same thing you can rest assured you're good OR Bitcoin is a failure.

Lol...my BTC would never be yours.  Do you know how bitcoin works?  Goober.  Nodes just VERIFY transactions, they don't put them in blocks.  Jesus.  
Also, once again, if I connect to every single node on the network, your 200 nodes wouldn't be shiite.
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:20:51
Once again, I can connect to EVERY node.  Are you trying to say bitcoin is bad?  How dare you.

...and it will be called Bitcoin-BIP148 on Coinbase and everywhere else since it is you pushing this.  Good luck with that.  Should they instead call it Bitcoin-Blockstream or Bitcoin-LukeJrandtheGeoCEntrics?  That's kinda catch actually.

Bitcoin will never have just 100 nodes.   That's insanely stupid.  Now maybe your side with it's fake version of bitcoin will.

The only solution is to increase the blocksize.  Blockstream is holding that hostage--they have to go.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:02:20
Oh...ok...good luck getting majority of the nodes.  How many are there again...derp, derp, derp.

Once again, if I connect to every node...not going to happen.  Sorry your fairy tales are over.

Remember in our discussion where there are exponentially more nodes than your made up 100.   Funny you think fewer nodes is centralized but say nothing about miner centralization.  Bitcoin is already centralized you goober.

I'm convinced I'm having a conversation with a paid bot.  Good luck with your shilling.
