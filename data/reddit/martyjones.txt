That's only true if you use 3rd party software like BitAddress. I'm talking about generating a private key offline using pen/paper and calculating the pubkey without using 3rd party software. The idea is to never expose the private key to a general purpose computer, even if it's air-gapped.
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:22:15
In a magazine that has a pretty good reputation, no less. Things like this go a long way in bringing the conversation away from "the blockchain" and back to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:38:31
Yeah - as I'm discovering, generating a random private key offline is a piece of cake. What's difficult is doing everything that comes after that without potentially exposing the key.
@_date: 2016-08-19 21:31:50
Are there any (reasonably cheap) VPS solutions that allow for this? My understanding is most have a policy against Tor
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:42:38
Yes absolutely.
It's probably not practical to go through all this work except for very large BTC holdings anyways - it's easier to just get a hardware wallet. I'm putting together a guide for institutional investors to whom this applies. Verification through the steps you mentioned or similar is a needed component.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:39:59
That last link is cool - i think that's probably the way to do it.
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:22:06
Arguably they aren't much different, although a GP computer has more basis for backdoor access. Regardless, you run into the same issue using an offline computer - how to calculate the public key without 3rd party software and without connecting to the internet...
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:04:02
No, and details are sparse. My guess:
Any data (song, video, etc) can be encoded using different formats. Some of these aren't feasible for consuming but can be converted to consumable format easily.
Bitcache might include encoded info for files that are uploaded to the website as part of a small BTC transaction.
Why? Because then the data for that file will be immutable.
Again, just a guess but would make sense. Hope it's something a little cooler - this is already being developed by Factom and probably others.
@_date: 2016-08-13 03:36:00
How do you propose generating a public key on an non persistent, air gapped computer?

@_date: 2016-08-12 20:59:27
The objective is to prevent private key exposure to an insecure system. While it's true that a TI-89 contains 3rd party software, I'm not very concerned with it being preloaded with malicious software in the way a general purpose computer could be.
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:11:58


SegWit is actually &gt;50% when you include Satoshi:0.13.99 clients, so feel free to retract your statement. And if you consider SegWit to be a contentious soft fork at &gt;50%, then you ought to consider BU an outright failure.


Providing raw data doesn't imply anything - but there are a lot of SegWit nodes, otherwise you wouldn't have made that implication. :)


Have you never seen node support levels at activation time for previous soft forks? How high was Satoshi:0.12.1 node count when the CSV soft fork activated? Was it even remotely close to 95%? Do you have empirical evidence suggesting that 50% node signaling can't support a successful soft fork? If so, why have similar numbers worked in the past?
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:56:52
Your belief that half of the network and 5% of the network are both "not a lot". One of those numbers is definitely "a lot". 
Telling that though you consider both to be "not a lot", you chose to focus on the 48% and not the 5.5%. You also chose to compare it to the 95% activation threshold, which refers to block signaling and not node signaling.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:07:07
I didn't contribute to 0.14 at all, and only fixed a typo in 0.13.1. Take these lists with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:49:26
Segwit cant activate at those levels so your example isnt relevant. Were miner support at 95% and node support at 50%, the transactions in question would be non standard to old nodes and would be enforceable under segwit's rules by more than half the network, so it's unclear what specific risk, if any, you're imagining.
@_date: 2017-02-01 00:28:53

@_date: 2017-02-01 01:32:47


No, you implied that. All the post title says is that these numbers matter, which is true. You chose to bring up what is "a lot" and what isn't.


Again, 95% refers to block signaling, not node signaling. 48% of the network's nodes is easily enough to support SegWit as a soft fork. 5.5% by contrast is nowhere near enough to support BU's proposed hard fork.
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:36:13
The amendment and wording come from BATS and not the SEC.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:46:11


@_date: 2017-02-01 16:47:57


Maybe you don't know how soft forks work, but they are optional in addition to being opt-in. Nodes are free to wait and see if a soft fork activates before upgrading, or avoid upgrading at all without worrying about being booted from the network. The fact that 50%+, a simple majority as you pointed out, are willing to upgrade on speculation and desire for the fork to activate is "a lot" of support, as it was for CSV. Or do you consider CSV to have been contentious as well? By your own definition, you must, because it didn't have 95% support. 
In fact, CSV has ~78% node support right now, despite having activated over 6 months ago. Would you characterize it as a failure or a contentious soft fork? If you wouldn't, then what is the threshold of node support for a soft fork to be non-contentious? Must be somewhere between 50% and 78% for you.


Saying SegWit has enough isn't strictly true - it has more than enough nodes to successfully activate, as proven by previous soft forks.
BU, on the other hand, can't activate because it has almost no support from users.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:18:23
Yeah, like I said BU has no built in protection from reorganization.
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:15:33
Using your own node to transact on the network provides you with increased privacy and the security of validating transactions, rather than relying on miners as SPV wallets do. This is equally true of pruned nodes as it is of full archival nodes.

I'm not disagreeing with you that a chain split is possible in this scenario, but that does not make this proposal a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:34:23
Did you read the link I provided? It's an excellent overview and supports the notion that this proposal is not a hard fork, while also acknowledging that a soft fork with less than 51% block support can result in chain split.

Replay protection is not quite the same as reorg protection from the bitcoin main chain. BTU has neither.
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:55:56


Sounds unsubstantiated, particularly if you've read the [mitigation of deployment risks]( much of which addresses the handling of the new transaction format by new and old nodes.


Again, block signaling refers to activation while node signaling relates to enforcement. You're conflating two entirely separate concepts.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:14:08

Go back and read his claim again. He never contends that my quoted sentence was added to the agreement after the fact. He refers instead to a different sentence being removed. BU will be listed under a new ticker, as Erik originally agreed to.


@_date: 2017-03-12 22:20:12


Nope, it's still a soft fork. Both types of forks can result in a chain split, depending on implementation and enforcement.
See [this StackExchange post]( for more info.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:32:35
True enough, but unfortunately this specific proposal relies on the BIP9 SegWit activation date to trigger &gt;0.13.1 nodes, so I don't think it can be extended without reverting to a more traditional flag day activation.

Seems like plenty of time for exchanges to upgrade or not and make their stances public.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:29:54


Yes! I'd feel far better about this if it were released as an optional upgrade by the Core team. People should recognize that while this isn't a lot of code, it still needs to be properly vetted and approved by more than just a few technically minded people.

@_date: 2017-03-19 15:21:07
We still have yet to see opinions from many core devs on this, so I doubt it's going to be implemented soon.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:45:00
Really? Because 1. it could only be done *after* the fork as they'd have to hardcode the block in question into the codebase, and 2. would effectively be the same as making every user run the command locally, given that everyone would have to upgrade their nodes.
But [according to Andrew Stone]( your idea is against the ethos of BTU anyways, so it doesn't matter:


All of this is of course before getting into the fact that BTU won't introduce replay protection in any case because it benefits from fucking over exchanges without replay protection, as the price can be artificially propped up while withdrawals are suspended. You have the wool pulled over your eyes. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:19:48
It can easily be a configurable option that must be switched on manually by the user. In that case there isn't a credible argument that anyone's being coerced into running it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:37:30
Yeah that's true. Still, absent another signed letter by the exchanges it's tough to see a user based consensus forming anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:53:08
I like the proposal. What does the process look like with respect to gaining consensus from the exchanges? Would there simply need to be another list on the bitcoin core website?
Also, i've yet to see comments from many of the well-known core devs. Are they reviewing to your knowledge?
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:28:29
Don't think they're close to doing it, sadly :/

@_date: 2017-03-15 01:33:08
Yup! It's been [seen before]( during other hard fork attempts.
In fact, many believe that the majority of miners who signal for BU are really running core. The fact that none seemed to suffer from today's attack lends some support to that notion.

The trezor stores all of your possible private keys. It shares the addresses associated with those private keys with mytrezor (or whatever wallet you use). You can use those addresses to receive bitcoin as you need them without plugging the trezor in. You can, however, confirm that the address you generate through your wallet is legit (as opposed to being placed there by a hacker) by plugging the trezor in and having it show the address on it's screen. Regardless, you don't need to "sync" the trezor with the wallet for it to know that you've received money. The only time you will need to plug it in is 1. if you need to send money, or 2. if you want to confirm that an address your wallet gives you is legit to use.
Finally, do not try become a miner unless you're okay with potentially operating at a financial loss.

I promise you that if TWTR management announced a bid process they would get offers for more than $9bn. Whether that's justified or not in the long run is beside the point. The market for TWTR stock is supported by high levels of liquidity and exit options. Bitcoin has lower liquidity and can't be sold, since it isn't a company.

* An interest in further centralizing mining
* A desire for the increase in fees won from larger blocks
* Concern for the future of widespread bitcoin adoption
Or some combination of all three. Point being, it's not a good idea to assume bad faith.

Income tax isn't the issue. The issue is when you buy btc at one price, and it appreciates or depreciates, and then you purchase something using btc and that creates a capital gain or loss that may need to be reported on your taxes. This doesn't happen when you convert USD to other fiat currencies and it's a really annoying prospect when you think about it.

They do that not to assert your tax liability but because they don't know where many transfers end up and would rather hand everything over to the IRS, rather than ending up in a scenario where they haven't reported customer sales. It's kind of dumb but doesn't actually change your tax liability - just more pain for reporting.

Coinbase doesn't decide your tax liability. The IRS does and it's up to you to report your taxes correctly.

You and I weren't discussing what's ideal, only what's possible. A gold standard is fully possible, regardless of whether it's desirable or not.
To your point, the example I gave of hyperinflation isn't necessary for a return to the gold standard. Just was pointing out that the level of debt isn't relevant.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:34:03
The level of US national debt has no bearing on the possibility for gold to be used as a backing for currency. The government could literally inflate all the debt away tomorrow and the next day use gold reserves to create a brand new dollar with ease.

If you hover your mouse over the numbers on the website you will see what I'm talking about. I promise you [it's there]( :)
Also from that site:








I'd add the fact that there's a high variance between block times where blocks can come in rapidly, one after another. It seems wise to have a big margin of safety, particularly if the device is not 100% dedicated to being a node. Even if you lower the margin of safety significantly you can't exactly crank up the block size on consumer grade bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-12-03 22:55:48
From the same website:


Hence the multiplication.

We agree that SegWit is better than a straight up increase to base blocksize - but when you make a claim that it actually does increase the blocksize, you risk creating confusion among those unfamiliar with the protocol as to why anyone would still want a hard fork. SegWit leaves the base blocksize unchanged but simulates the benefits of increasing it by decreasing the data stored in a block. That's different, politically and technically, then changing the actual blocksize, so the distinction is important.
@_date: 2016-09-30 18:03:31
From consensus.h in the bitcoin source code, lines 15-16:
    /** The maximum allowed size for a block excluding witness data, in bytes (network rule) */
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000;
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:02:35
you can guarantee in equilibrium it will be lower than a BTC tx fee. In all likelihood, a lot lower.
@_date: 2016-09-10 19:48:42

Interesting how he said he doesn't think Bitcoin has been seriously attacked yet. Wonder if he's referring to state actors.
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:22:25
The witness is a separate data structure, which is why old nodes will be able to download the stripped blockchain and ignore that data. You could say that from the view of an upgraded node, the blocksize does become bigger, but as long as old nodes are enforcing the 1MB limit we don't truly have an increased base blocksize.
@_date: 2016-09-30 16:48:13
Not in the base blocksize.
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:57:04
This conversation is getting increasingly pedantic, but the core answer to your question, which I've given several times, is that non-witness data remains relegated to Bitcoin's 1MB blocksize limit. You can call the addition for witness data a blocksize increase if you want, but MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE continues to equal 1000000 and absent a hard fork it will remain unchanged. Moving data into new structures with larger size limits is a distinct strategy from increasing the base blocksize.
@_date: 2016-09-27 17:37:26
[Judge for yourself]( but it doesn't really make much of a difference.
@_date: 2016-09-30 21:02:42
I'm in support of SegWit and not in support of increasing the block size. But it's still good to be honest about what's actually going on in the code.
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:02:00
It reduces the amount of data stored in the bitcoin blockchain by storing witness data elsewhere. It absolutely 100% does not change the base block size.
@_date: 2016-09-10 14:10:37
Institutional investors generally can't buy Bitcoin directly. In the same way that they can't buy gold or any other unregistered security. Hence the need for ETFs for those products.

It was also intended that 1 CPU = 1 vote. That isn't how it's panned out, and that's okay.
@_date: 2016-09-30 16:56:54
You're confusing the benefits of SegWit with what it actually does. It provides a similar benefit to slightly increasing the blocksize but does nothing of the sort, which is why those who want a blocksize increase are not satisfied.
@_date: 2016-09-24 21:18:19

Nodes accept the chain with the most proven work, not the longest history. So you'd have to exceed the PoW on the current chain which makes it much more expensive to edit the history that the $400m posited. Constructing your own private chain would be extremely expensive
