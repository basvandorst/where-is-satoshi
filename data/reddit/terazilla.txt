The fact they haven't increased the block rate/size to keep Bitcoin usable just seems like horrific mismanagement to me. It doesn't matter if it's a temporary fix, users don't care about that and the numbers can be dialed back when a long term solution that makes them happy is put into place.
And if that solution doesn't magically work for everyone without them taking extra steps, then it's probably DOA anyway.

We'll see. From my perspective there's two issues: first, if LN is an actual choice people need to make, I don't think it's user friendly enough. The typical user isn't going to know shit about this.
Second, the dev team has demonstrated that they're willing to let Bitcoin suffer for months on end with major usability problems, even when easy temporary fixes are available.  That won't go away overnight and is a very legitimate reason for a business to be wary.

It sounds stupid, but half of the task here is marketing, and that last bit counts for a lot.

Man, that sounds a bit crazy considering BTC won't have a hard limit at any point in your lifetime.  Unless you're The Doctor.

Well, that's been known about almost since launch, they just recently came to concensus about whether to leave it alone or not.

Right, but we're talking like, 1.5% vs 2.5%, and the frequency of blocks is part of the reason it's approachable to a new miner.

It's cool that you posted this, and it was interesting to look through, but this is quite unworkable in practice and simply banning bitcoin would be a lot more cut and dried.
Even setting aside the unenforcable licencing stuff, you're supposed to maintain identity records of everybody you ever send bitcoin to?  Does the grocery store do that when I pay in cash?  Of course not, it's obscene law enforcement overrreach, unworkable and ridiculous.
Bitcoins older than five years go to the state of New York?  Literally not possible in many cases, not to mention an offensive cash-grab.
Profits can't be kept in bitcoin?  How in the world is that supposed to work?
It's like you think this is a bank, or something.

No, this was in place since its inception, though it was initially considered a bug.  The thing two days ago was that the contributors came to a consensus that it should stay.
The community's been well aware of it the whole time, but some folks don't like the concept of inflation.
