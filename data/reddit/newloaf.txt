If (big If) I ever reach my goal crypto wealth, I plan to start drawing down the money annually in the largest chunk at which I could pay the minimum capital gains tax.
"Cashing out" means paying taxes after all.
And one reason to keep holding is that whatever dollar value you get from your cryptos you then have to defend against inflation and possible economic collapse. We're about ten years overdue for a major correction and the next one could mean global collapse.

Before everybody jumps on the Paypal-is-great bandwagon, a tiny look into how they fuck people over might be in order. Specifically, the non-negotiable 6 month hold they place on a merchant or user's account anytime illegal activity is... wait for it.... *suggested.* That's not "proven", but "suggested".
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:54:12
Well, a lot of the talk around cryptocurrency relates to escaping traditional systems which in addition to being slow and expensive, treat customers like crap. In my opinion, Paypal skews a lot closer to Bank of America than the systems we like to envision.

You *could* buy on credit but I don't recommend it. It's impossible to say what will happen. Maybe there'll be a $3K dip and you'll be glad that money was delayed!
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:38:02
We're basically on the exact same page, OP, down to the wallet and exchange. I don't keep *any* amount of crypto in an exchange. What's worth $2K this morning could be worth 5 this afternoon after all.
Here's a little trick I like to employ regarding the 24-word seed: even though I keep it as secure as possible, it's not the real seed. Pick one of the words and change it to something else. Then even if it's discovered or stolen, it's useless.
Keep spreading the good word.

Yeah, I was happy to get another fragment of my first bitcoin at $17K. :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:40:32
Literally anything *can* happen. However, the market conditions around bitcoin are completely different now and a lot more people are watching it, which makes me believe that buyers waiting in the wings wouldn't let it dip by that much.

I was going to do something like that, until I saw that Coinbase's 1.5% fee only applied to &gt;$200 transactions. I'll go onto GDAX and do it by hand before I pay higher than 1.5%.

@_date: 2017-12-15 17:12:31
Yes. If the platform checked the first letter of the address that would fix it. Failing that, they could put a little note there beneath the field letting people know what digit it should start with.
But they're making so much money so fast I'm sure they can't be bothered.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:45:51
This is my problem. Will it ever dip below $10K again, or will I end up buying again at 20?

Not sure why you're so interested in my opinion, but....
I'm not worried about a new form of wealth. The wealthy are so systemically favored over the poor (especially outside Western Europe), it's hard to imagine yet another avenue to avoiding taxes mattering all that much.
I think bitcoin will fizzle out if quantum computing means the encryption can be brute-forced, and render the whole thing irrelevant. But I'm not losing sleep over it.

No shit. If they're so UI/UX focused, how come the address field for BTC transfers doesn't flag users trying to send to LTC addresses? This would involve simply checking the first digit for address type. Or an even lower-tech solution would be a little note reminding people what digit their destination address should start with.
There are whole forums dedicated to people trying to recover their litecoin from a bitcoin address.

Here's a tip that others will tell you and bears repeating: when moving crypto to your wallet the first time, do a micro-transfer, 0.0001 BTC or whatever, first. Then if you somehow manage to screw it up, no big deal

I too sent LTC to a BTC Segwit wallet on Ledger Nano S. I've been trying the steps but am somewhat out of my depth.

The wealthy already hold most of the world in wage slavery. I wouldn't consider this a huge setback because I don't agree with you on the change in scope.
It doesn't matter whether or not I want to ban bitcoin, since it can't be banned. Governments could ban exchanges, but when have the world's governments all agreed on one thing before? Also any ban would disproportionately disadvantage the poor, not the wealthy, so no I wouldn't be on the street advocating for a ban.

Coinbase wouldn't have them. This is if the user moves the coins by mistake from Coinbase to an address he controls.
The coins still exist but are misidentified by a BTC address rather than an LTC address. The user is able to fix this in 12 or 15 super-easy steps if you have a recovery key. If you use a Trezor they've created an app to help, if you use a Ledger set aside an afternoon.

I am a leftist and I am anti-capitalist, but not pro-government since the US government (at least) is demonstrably corrupt and anti-people. How would giving a corrupt government more power benefit its citizens?
I don't expect bitcoin to fizzle and I also don't expect it to "change the world". I do think it's a little early to wave your hand and say that quantum computing won't have any serious effect because x, y, and z. No one thought personal computers would be a big deal in 1980 either.


This is part of the disconnect between "Left" and Right in the States. I put Left in quotes because what you call Left is usually the Democrats, which everywhere else would be called the right-of-center Business Party.
If Leftists want to "control society", you can sleep easy. Completely amoral business interests completely control society, top to bottom (that's not controversial to say, is it?) and I don't think it's going to change in my lifetime. It's a paranoid fantasy to think that the scary leftists are going to change anything in the US, they are right now completely disorganized and powerless. This country will continue to enjoy one of the lowest standards of living and greatest divides between rich and poor in the developed world. [/rant]
But yeah, bitcoin is very interesting, and to me personally the idea of a decentralized currency completely beyond government control is very enticing, both financially and philosophically.

Hard to see how it will ever be anything but a speculative asset. Improved ease-of-use would presumably lead to the asset itself gaining even more value and possibly being even more volatile. The limited quantity more or less guarantees either perpetual inflation or irrelevance.

Buy through Coinbase (if you can wait a week or two, GDAX has lower fees). When the asset is yours, move it to a hardware wallet. I bought a Ledger and it works fine, but I'm not sure it's the best of the two.
Pro-top: using the wallet for the first time is stressful. Transfer a small amount first to ensure you understand the process.
I made the mistake of transferring some LTC to a BTC address. This was from Coinbase and they had no mechanism in place to check the address. I didn't lose the asset, but it took a long and involved process to correct my mistake.

I don't "know" anything. But what I believe is that two other major bubbles are going to pop, real estate and the stock market, in the immediate future. The next stock market correction is going to be major, I'm very much not alone in believing this.
When that happens, this entirely new and widely hyped asset class is going to be very attractive to people who suddenly need a place to hide their wealth. I think a lot of big players are going to want to get away from the US dollar, at least in the short term, and that that will be the next big bubble.
I also believe that cryptocurrencies as an asset will be around a good long time, but with the bubble first, just like tech stocks at the turn of the century. Everyone remembers the crash, but also they conveniently forget Apple, Amazon, ~~Facebook~~ Yahoo, etc. Not *everyone* gets crushed when the bubble bursts.

What I don't understand is the concept of tax on coin-to-coin transactions. If I exchange x BTC for y ETH, how is it even possible to have a gain/loss? It's an equivalent exchange.

The market itself is also significantly changed, with whole new classes of investor, much broader adoption, media coverage, etc etc. Looking at past timing is just about pointless.

We all want the same things. I just take exception to certain things being presented, two or three threads a day, as some kind of crisis.

I like that you put the work in to explain what you mean by "3 words", but anyone clueless enough to actually need the examples is probably beyond help.

I don't understand the distinction between a mobile wallet, an internet-based wallet, and a hardware wallet. My instinct is to go with the hardware wallet, but does this mean a hardware failure will invalidate my bitcoin account? If the information is simply an "address", can it be copied down on paper?

The title of the article actually says *more* than the article itself, which only says a tiny bit related to the first half. That's a new trick, so congrats to them!
Wish I could get paid to write nothing articles like this one.

Yeah, they'll level off, then newer and better exchanges and wallets will appear and they'll come back.
The hand wringing about this shit is pointless. Everyone didn't sign up for internet service in the same week.

I haven't lost a dime since I don't sell at a loss.

Speak for yourself.

You certainly are in love with your own opinion... which you've somehow conflated with the ability to see the future.
