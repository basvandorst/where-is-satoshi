You come in here as a beginner and then act like a know-it-all, great way to get advice. I don't think you're ready yet.

Well, you could find private sellers and trade cash for bitcoin in person if you want to avoid revealing information. All you need is a bitcoin wallet (paper, hardware or digital). But the rates you get may be worse than exchanges. Just sign up for an exchange, deposit money and send you coins to an offline Wallet and then delete your account on the exchange.

Switched to ING after Commbank refused to do a charge back on a fraudulent credit card purchase. 3 years before that their "anti theft" systems failed me and allowed someone to make hundreds of bets on an online gambling site emptying thousands of dollars and sending my account in the negatives. Fuck commbank

Same, up $450 even though I fomo'd and bought at 4400 2 months ago. Now I'm trying to convince her to let me put in 250 a week.
