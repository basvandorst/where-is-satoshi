Occupy Wall-Street was a contrived movement, it was not an organic resistance.
BTC/Crypto Prediction *Put Tin Foil Hat On and buckle up*:
Crypto was released with no one knowing the name of the true creator. The intent of this release was to engineer consent among people who would normally be skeptical about buying and selling using a digital asset. The release enables people to feel like they are fighting against international governments and banks, and the whole time they are innovating and creating newer,better, and more advanced blockchains. Essentially they are creating the very thing that will enslave them and all the while they think they are fighting against the system.
Fast Forward: BTC/Crypto reaches fever pitch media attention right as a world economic collapse happens, people run to crypto currency for refuge during times of the crisis because it has gained popularity and consensus as a real alternative. BOOM The exchanges and assets are seized,seemingly overnight, and converged into the most advanced and controllable coin that the powers that be have created through the innovations of the free market.
Suddenly, Crypto is now the only form of currency that is allowed by governmental entities worldwide because it is fully traceable and everything about every transaction is recorded on the ledger, I.E., no more untaxed money in the form of cash can ever exist. Now the mega banks have engineered consent, normalized a digital currency, and have seized full control of the currency, all without anyone fighting the system. ByeBye Freedom and Hello microchip. You just built your own prison.
