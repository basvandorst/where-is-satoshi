Justified, but not necessarily authorized. The OP is free to pay Paypal using another means, one they have proven to the OP that their debit is reasonable and valid.

Do you forsee a day when traditional bank processing methods will be extended to include Bitcoin? As in, items are routinely deposited via the block chain just as they clear via ACH or cashletter today, your DDA account is also your bank-administered wallet, and FINCEN is kept happy by some sort of colored coin or known-address-list scheme? (Herp derp look at me everyone I work in banking - sorry all)
Or is there even any need to create space within Bitcoin for this traditional world of banking, with its dispute resolution and government involvement and forfeiture and different kinds of fraud and fraud prevention? Are we diametrically opposed or is there common ground?

Exactly. Please also point out to your bosses that this risk is not unique to Bitcoin. If you process a payment card sale for $1000 USD using a card that draws on a British account, £610 GBP is taken from their account. Suppose the dollar then becomes much weaker against the pound Sterling. You refund $1000 USD, but only £500 GBP is put back in the customers account. They could file a chargeback for the remaining £110 GBP, and an additional $220 would be debited from the depository account attached to your merchant account. Sale amount $1000, refund amount $1220.
Also Bitcoin doesn't require refunds be processed in any specific way. USD is "legal tender for all debts public and private" here.

If they withdraw money from your checking account via ACH, you have up to 30 days to report those ACH withdrawals as unauthorized to your bank.  (30 days for a consumer DDA account, or 1 day for a business account.)
I'd call your bank.

Are these kids who self-selected for an interest in technology? Have they had some basic programming instruction? Or is this more about fundamentals of using computers, office skills and such?

They are a piece of shit for other reasons, but to be fair when they freeze funds it's to protect against people taking advantage. They have to.
Payment card and check transactions are reversible. Paypal has to protect themselves from other fraudulent pieces of shit who deliberately receive payments they know will be reversed later, have the money sent to a bank account, zero out that account's balance, and then refuse to repay PayPal when the transaction is reversed.
So this leaves PayPal with a few options:
* only fund transactions from non-reversible sources, like XBT with sufficiently high confirmations
* hold all transferred funds until the reversal period has elapsed: 1 day for business checks, 30 days for consumer checks (either cashletter / X9 or ACH converted), 3 months for DDA-linked payment cards, 6 months for credit cards, 6-8 confirmations for XBT
* use fraud detection tools to only do the above for high risk transactions, and inflate your rate a bit more to cover unanticipated fraudulent pieces of afore-mentioned shit
I wish for option 1 but I can see why they took option 3.

How might life have been different for Ross if we had:
1) a way to configure Windows to always, unconditionally, lock the screen and require a password at a set interval.
2) a way to set up your laptop with whatever devices you need to have plugged in, then fill up every other port with a throwaway device (small thumb drive, etc), and finally set the system to immediately crash (blue screen, abend, whatever) if anything is unplugged.
How might life be different for the next person, if these things become available?
I have a key for debug/checked versions of Windows in my MSDN subscription, though I've never written a device driver before. I'll do the work, if someone with experience in this area can point me at some tutorials / doc that could get me started. I do C a little C++, and an happy to RTFM.

Well crap. Sorry, my rhetorical ish question doesn't help then. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:20:54
I don't know the history, but either this question will clear things up or it'll make things muddier:
"So I heard about a guy trading pizzas for bitcoins a long time ago. Do those coins exist on the BTC network, the BCH network, or both?"
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:46:14
I misunderstood - what you're describing does the trick. TIL. Thank you for sharing that. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:08:40
Yeah, I remember that. 
If all ports were full, and the system blue-screened the moment something was unplugged to make room for the ducky, that attack would have failed. 
I want to make that tech a reality.

I just had a stupid thought. AU and AG are the element abbreviations on the periodic table. Well what are Bitcoin made of? 0's and 1's? CPU cycles? Merkle trees? Secret keys? 
So . . . X01? 
. . . yeah, I'll show myself the door.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:47:45
I think you're on to something. I might pick a nit and say Bitcoin is just a less convenient currency, not a non-currency. Way, way less convenient. I hope that's about to change.
(You know what bugs me? BTC. A currency code abbreviation is supposed to use the two-letter country code as the first two, like USD, CAD, JPY, or else start with X like XAU (gold Troy ounce) or XAG (silver). So how about XBC? XBT?)

What exactly are the BSA/AML regulatory hurdles your compliance people are worried about? 
You can receive bitcoins from an authenticated customer but you don't know where they came from. You can also receive cash from an authenticated customer but you don't know where it came from either. Depositing or withdrawing BTC doesn't make you a party to any placement, layering, or integration activities, does it? As long as you file CTR's and SAR's for BTC activity the same way you would for cash activity, you're performing the same function with no additional regulatory risk exposure, right?
