It's clearly not Satoshi Nakamoto, was just an interesting approach. Was mostly hoping to get HistoryOfBitcoin.org some coverage as it is a pretty well put together site. Here is the text of the email for reference:














@_date: 2014-01-22 22:22:55
Thanks again for this by the way, looks great! I'll have it up on the site shortly.
@_date: 2015-08-10 08:40:23
Feel free to repost it and let us know if automod removes it. We allow and encourage discussion of such topics in @_date: 2015-08-10 20:38:27
There's always too, with an active community that follows both Bitcoin and alternate cryptocurrencies. We've been picking up in activity for a bit and the mods are starting to put more into the sub.
@_date: 2015-08-12 06:07:44
Well there is and of course one of my personal favorites I don't think you'll find the level of activity that has at either, but if you're looking for a new home they would both be good places to try out.
edit: Also, posting this to isn't likely to win you any favors.

Slush's Pool was my first too, though it was GPU mining.
This almost makes me want to get an Antminer S5 and give it another go.
@_date: 2015-08-12 06:10:44
Well most of the ASICs you could go after won't be profitable. If you're willing to shell out around $500 the Bitmain Antminer S5 could be slightly profitable.
If you're just looking for something low cost to play around with the Bitmain U3 is a small personal miner for cheap with a relatively decent hash rate for the cost. Though I feel it is important to stress that you will be losing money mining with these unless you have free electricity.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:07:57
I think a lot of people post links that would be better suited for a general cryptocurrency audience to as it has a larger audience. But this is still a Bitcoin specific subreddit so you can't really blame mods for limiting the amount of stuff only tangibly related to Bitcoin. It can't be easy keeping a sub this large free of scams and malicious content and is probably much easier to limit only to items directly related to Bitcoin.
We're working to make a better discussion forum as well. Now that the Bitcoin clone explosion of 2013 has mostly subsided we can focus on some of the actually interesting developments going on in the space and not on all the noise that was created by people pumping their favorite coin.

I thought somebody got ahold of Satoshi's email address, but that's it.

Things that lead to Bitcoin's value:
 * Resource Allocation From Mining (i.e. computing power, electricity)
 * Design (i.e. Innovative protocol, Mathematical finiteness)
 * Community (i.e. The way the blockchain fork was handled)
Anything else?

I'm trying to do more posts that detail using Bitcoin as opposed to just talking about it. There are a lot of cool Bitcoin vendors out there. I'm getting pretty comfortable with it and now prefer using it to credit cards or paypal.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:40:33
Possibly, but I'd still say its value mainly lies in the size of the network of people that use it. This leverages the traits of Bitcoin that make it preferable to traditional currencies, such as being able to send money anywhere anytime.

The real question is how much the euro will drop relative to BTC this week.

Thanks, glad you enjoyed it! I didn't make much mention of Namecoin just because of the fact that it is merged mined and not an endeavor in itself. However, I love the concept.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:49:20
Actual Bitcoin user here, I buy/use Bitcoin for both reasons. If Bitcoin had a constant price it would be preferable for nearly all online transactions as it eliminates the 3% that payment processors take off the top. Not to mention that I control my money and can send it to any other Bitcoin user anywhere, anytime. 
The appreciation of Bitcoin is an added bonus, but I'd still prefer to use it over credit cards, paypal, etc. even if the price weren't increasing.
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:03:59
I'm in the same boat, I'll probably be ordering a video card or two in the next week. Their prices are pretty good and, at least in my case, the shipping was very quick.

Correction - this is not a hard fork, the title is wrong. The blockchain has diverged between 0.7 and 0.8 as mentioned...everywhere...
So the blockchain has forked and devs are working with miners to resolve the issue - more in my post.

Personally I like LTC and TRC as I think they could have a role to play. One adds an alternative to BTC and the other adds redundancy to BTC making the market as a whole stronger. They both also have faster confirmation times at 2.5 minutes and 2 minutes respectively. 
If anyone's interested I just put together a [guide for mining Terracoin]( and hope to get one up for Litecoin shortly.

There are a few good options for Bitcoin news. CoinDesk is a collection of big name Bitcoin writers and has a bunch of good information. Bitcoin Magazine also offers very well written Bitcoin news articles and some longer pieces that you won't find anywhere else. Here are my suggestions:
**News Sites**
* [CoinDesk](
* [Bitcoin Magazine](
**News Aggregators**
* [The Daily Bitcoin](
* [Zero Block](
* [Mine Foreman](
* [Coding In My Sleep](
* [CryptoJunky (that's me)](
There are plenty others, but I think you'll find what you're looking for with one/some of the above.

If your hard drive is somehow corrupted and unrecoverable, and you didn't backup your wallet, then they are lost. Backup your wallet.
I wouldn't worry about running Bitcoin inside a virtual machine. If you're testing out new cryptocurrencies a VM is a good idea, especially if you haven't validated the code yourself or had someone reputable validate it.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:49:34
I haven't checked recently, but I believe the coins attributed to Satoshi have remained untouched/unmoved since his/her/their disappearance. If the goal were to get rich quick, Satoshi could have cashed out recently for millions, yet there they remain. 
The way Bitcoin deals with the initial distribution problem is actually pretty ingenious. Development is incentivized for early adopters, meaning that once you own Bitcoin you have cause to invest further into the infrastructure that supports Bitcoin. Thus the Bitcoin economy grows on itself - giving us the support structure we have today.
@_date: 2013-10-03 02:26:53
It could be a good thing, Bitcoin has the general public's attention right now. For instance, there have been 1,000+ readers in for awhile now, where as usually there are only around 300.
Edit: Perhaps not the general public, but at least those that are interested in Bitcoin but don't normally follow Bitcoin related news.

Asus makes some pretty good laptops. Most of the ones I checked out in the same price range were Windows 8 optimized with touchscreens. I really just wanted something that I could run a linux distro with on one partition and Windows 7 on the other, so I went with the Lenovo.
I was looking at a HP Envy. I had a Voodoo Envy years ago when they still made custom laptops so I thought there might be some carry over. Once I took a look at them I was pretty unhappy, and then I remembered why I don't buy HP products.

Can't say that I know the details on this one. I know people were worried about biased reporting from Coin LLC, the company that owns Bitcoin magazine. This doesn't seem to be a problem so far. 
I do recall reading about a prior owner being disgruntled with the change.

It depends on where you're located at. In the US FinCen has issued guidance on virtual currencies, which would be a good place to start researching.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:11:24
As for the fiat exchange portion...
It might be easier to utilize the existing financial infrastructure rather than trying to build a new one from the ground up. This concept would allow for the use of say, local banks, to form the network of exchanges. They already have the ability to exchange Fiat currencies among each other and are well versed in their respective countries/regions regulations. 
Smaller, local banks would be targeted for adoption first. A network of smaller banks exchanging currencies in this manner could give them the ability to compete with larger banks. Also, users of a particular bank could have both a balance in fiat and in BTC with their bank, making the transition between the two all the easier.

By eliminating the fee inherent in payment processors these retailers could offer further discounts on their online goods versus physical retailers. What's more is that Bitcoin lends itself well to virtual retailers and is perhaps less friendly when used in physical settings (requires smartphone, hardware, etc.). 
This could give large online retailers further advantage versus their physical counterparts. Once they finally delve into the potential benefits of using virtual currencies, and once Bitcoin  matures a bit more, they are likely to adopt.

Avalon is in the middle of shipping their first batch, but have a proven product. BFL is way past any of their original deadlines but is reported to have an actual product now that might go out in the next couple of weeks. Either way, you're looking at a pre-order and wait.

I've got to agree on this one, they have some very well written pieces. They get much more in depth than say a typical blog does and don't have the sort of shameless product promotion that you see in more commercialized publications. I've been picking up my copy at Barnes and Noble the last couple of months, they recently switched it from the tech section to the finance/news section.
It is worth noting that they had a possibly controversial change in ownership recently.

I'd been wanting to put together an article that covered this for awhile. After reading through the Hacker News thread on Bitcoin hitting $100 yesterday I felt it necessary to point out a few things. Bitcoin is not just a  replacement as it allows us to do different things online. Rather, Bitcoin is a new technology with new properties that we're just starting to get acquainted with. If anyone's interested I posted it on Hacker news to see what, if any reaction it garners from the folks over there.

@_date: 2013-12-02 18:40:09
ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuits. They are essentially purpose built chips that do one thing very well. In the case of Bitcoin ASICs they generate SHA-256 hashes.
Unfortunately that is all that they can do. They are not able to perform other computations such as those that can be performed by CPUs or GPUs. FPGAs, field programmable gate arrays, which were used in Bitcoin mining prior to ASICs can have multiple purposes.
There are plenty of applications that CPUs, GPUs and FGPAs can be applied to. However, Bitcoin ASICs are restricted solely to SHA-256 hashing. I suppose if you could find another use for the SHA-256 algorithm that required massive computation then you might be able repurpose Bitcoin ASICs.

I've tried some Bitcoin ad networks in the past, but none of them really worked out (i.e. bitcoin fabulous). It is a great idea and somewhat surprising that it hasn't been more prevalent in Bitcoin to this point.
One thing that past Bitcoin oriented ad networks lacked were decent analytics. I don't need all the details, but I'd like at least an idea of how many pageviews the ad network is registering for my site.
Once you guys are up and running let me know. I've love to try you out on my site [cryptojunky.com]( and would be pretty stoked to have a decent ad network that pays out in Bitcoin.

Well GUIminer Scrypt is a litecoin mining program, I'd try @_date: 2013-04-03 02:47:09
Thanks again!

Hopefully this goes through! As a fellow North Carolinian, I'd be disappointed if it didn't.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:28:35
I went ahead and did a write up on it as well as a quick guide on how to create a QR code. I'm sure there will be major news outlets covering it tomorrow, but maybe this will help 'em get started...
@_date: 2013-03-18 14:04:09
I went ahead and added that merchants link after the Getting Bitcoins section. Thanks for the advice!

It's interesting to see Yahoo covering Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-10 03:54:31
It is too early to tell whether or not alternate crypto currencies will constitute a significant portion of the market or not. Personally I'd like to see one or more of them succeed.
Having a few of these currencies as opposed to just one make the crypto currency as a whole more difficult to attack and could even make Bitcoin stronger in a way. I mine a bit of the 'alts' as well as Bitcoin. 
As far as which one will win? Depending on what happens with the Bitcoin blockchain size, Terracoin could play a role as a sort of extension of Bitcoin, though that is admittedly reaching a bit. It could benefit from the technological advancements of Bitcoin (FPGAs, ASICs, etc) making it more secure than competitor. However, it is very young and the only real advantage it has is having the fastest confirmation time of any coin.
Litecoin on the other hand has some serious potential to compete with Bitcoin. Personally I think that the success of these coins is in part dependent on having a wide distribution and large base of users. This is easier to accomplish in the near/mid term with Litecoin as even casual users can still mine the coin.
I suppose we'll see in the coming months/years!
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:13:47
I put together a post on the millibit about two months ago, oh how times and values are changing!

It sure is, both Bitpay and Coinbase offer software that helps to do this. I've ordered quite a few things online with Bitcoin, and received them all to the correct address in a timely manner.
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:09:00
Good point. My guess is that they'd refund the same dollar amount though I can't be sure.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:09:26
There have been several instances of IT admins getting fired for doing such things. I'd be careful/wary of doing this.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:50:29
Nice, grew up near there myself. I was hoping Percy Harvin would be good to go but looks like he's still questionable. Tonight's game should be a good one!
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:50:18
There are a few solutions for merchants depending on what you're trying to do. You can accept bitcoin and have it automatically converted to your currency of choice if you'd like.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:44:00
I did, bought a new router.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:40:31
I believe the Bitcoin-qt client usually catches those transactions and doesn't let you send them. Sending between two different wallets or with a different client may work though.
There have been instances where large Bitcoin amounts were included as fees, in excess of the block reward. This would go to helping miners. However, I think you could better donate your coin to a charitable organization of open source software project. Miners aren't likely to notice the difference in the reward size unless it is significantly larger than normal.
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:31:09
I believe it was addressed in this update:

I'd like to suggest the following subreddit:

Had a pretty good comment from a new user from Spain

Yep, definitely derped on that one. The one-time address shouldn't matter but it's still good practice to sanitize. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:06:59
Not a stupid question. It's tough to say when it is a good/bad time to buy Bitcoin, especially with the volatility of the last few days. I'd say investing a bit of money into Bitcoin is a good idea, but you should research it for yourself and decided exactly when you'd like to put money in.
Personally I put small bits of money in over a longer period of time.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:07:12
It seems as though many Gold advocates/enthusiasts are very anti-bitcoin. Their worry/skepticism only helps to fuel my confidence in Bitcoin. If they weren't worried or concerned about Bitcoin then I might be concerned.
It's a shame too, as many gold enthusiasts and Bitcoin enthusiasts probably share similar perspectives on economics and politics.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:59:01
Looks like a decent little site! It is tough to get past the downvotes on these days. When a link to [my blog post from yesterday]( was posted it was met with downvotes. But now today a [Yahoo Finance article covering the same story]( is one of the top posts (The yahoo story even references my post "via cryptojunky.com").
Moral of the story is that has grown a lot and now favors bigger names over smaller. It makes sense really as larger names have larger networks that can better distribute news about Bitcoin. Don't take it personally and keep on working on your project, you're doing good work. I'd suggest trying to submit to some of the smaller Bitcoin related subreddits. A lot of the smaller subreddits don't get as much love as they ought to, and would welcome your content!
edit: formatting.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:13:04


My favorite part. Thanks for posting this, a good read!
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:05:24
Well perhaps you will pioneer academic economic research on Bitcoin and break with the old. Good luck!

Well there it is.

Could be any number of things...I guess we'll find out sometime today.
@_date: 2013-05-19 02:36:54
This would be awesome and I'd use it, but I doubt there's the demand for it at the moment. It would be a cool think to build with possible future application though.

Have an upvote for writing that whole thing out, though I only skimmed it.
tl;dr Bitcoin wins, becomes default currency, Litecoin, Namecoin literally killed by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:45:03
I'm in Bitcoin for the long term, definitely not cashing out. It may go down, it may not, none of us are capable of accurately predicting the future. However, the principles and the recent growth in acceptance suggest that in the long term demand for Bitcoin will outstrip supply. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:48:56
It's a gamble at the moment. Right now it looks like your best bet would probably be getting in on Batch III of Avalon ASIC as they've produced and shipped an actual product. But even then, if BFL actually starts shipping they could beat your Avalon product and they're supposed to be much more energy efficient. Personally, I'm waiting to see how things play out in the next couple of weeks.
@_date: 2013-03-15 04:24:46
Nice write up as usual MineForeman.

Yep, and it works pretty well. You're all welcome to send me a test message if you get it up and running!
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:34:30
Thanks for the tip! I'm not sure how it would work with electrum, you might just try sending yourself a small amount and see or perhaps I'll finally try out electrum and get back to you. 
You would have to include large transaction fees over many blocks if you wanted to spread the wealth. If it was done one just one transaction then only one pool would receive the bonus fee.
Having a large group of early Bitcoin holders doing it would be one way to further distribute Bitcoin wealth and help increase profitability. As a stunt to push more focus on the profitability of mining including a large fee in a single transaction would definitely get the attention of miners, and in turn the news would be passed around the community. 
I've seen large fees included before to the order of tens of Bitcoins, just not recently.

I disagree, as originally envisioned Bitcoin was simply meant to be a more efficient way of doing commerce online, not necessarily replace or destroy other means of exchange. Bitcoin is meant to augment the financial system, eliminating the need for a third party mediator and streamlining exchanges online.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:44:22
A few places you might check
I've also put together a guide
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:55:49
Bitcoin is in an interesting stage at the moment. It's become established enough that more and more people are beginning to use it as a means of exchange. However, it's still young enough that the services built on top of it are experiencing growing pains. The Bitcoin protocol is working very well, the problem now lies in the interaction between traditional financial systems and the Bitcoin protocol.
Once this friction has been relieved, and there are efficient, timely, effective manners of getting FIAT into BTC (i.e. near instant), then we won't have much of a need for a service like paypal. In fact, as originally envisioned Bitcoin was meant to alleviate the need for such services. Paypal and similar services end up acting as mediators out of necessity. Bitcoin eliminates the need for third party mediators.
As Bitcoin becomes more mature the need for services like Paypal will (hopefully) disappear and Bitcoin will become the preferred method of payment. Rejecting paypal as a merchant will only help to hasten this process and bring more people into Bitcoin. However, you will be denying yourself some business via paypal in the short term.

That's pretty cool, thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-10 04:19:31
Unfortunately I think merge mining might have had a negative effect on Namecoin. I love the concept too, but the people that have Namecoin are those that merge mine with Bitcoin with a lot of Hashing power. Namecoin needs better distribution in order to gain traction again.
Also, there are subreddits for Namecoin, Litecoin and Terracoin:
 [Namecoin](
 [Litecoin](
 [Terracoin](
EDIT: Looks like there is also one for PPC

Network security and decentralization are the pros. I know that the environmental cost has been addressed before, might have to look into it again though. Especially with things changing the way they are.
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:39:07
Both Avalon ASIC and ASIC miner have verified ASICs mining Bitcoin. Butterfly Labs has publicly announced that their test chips are working and they're just waiting on packaging of their first shipment (BFL has not been independently verified). ASICs are very real, hence the recent increase in hash rate.
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:48:00
For the record I'd really like to see BitcoinStore succeed.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:11:19
It doesn't fit nicely into any of the existing ways that we view finance, making it difficult for some to understand.

Good to hear! Its nice to see a quality print publication dedicated to Bitcoin and thanks for putting together some quality pieces.

Out of curiosity what would you prefer? Something written in Python, or did you have something else in mind?

This is awesome. Would you mind if we used it?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:31:50
Well I suppose I finally need to do some research on Ripple. It could act as  the means of exchange amongst the exchanges, especially for fiat currencies. This would eliminate the necessity of using traditional financial systems for this purpose. Also, the individual user wouldn't have to navigate ripple, they would just interact with the single physical exchange.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:36:39
Here's their [Reddit post announcing the service]( for reference.
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:30:25
ASICMiner is likely contributing a good deal of that hashing power.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:43:03
Not sure what you're referring to. I'm still mining away, ASICs on Bitcoin and GPUs on Litecoin. At the moment both are bringing in a good little bit of money as well. 
Just because you're seeing less coins than you used to doesn't mean mining is dead, it just means more people are invested into the currency. It is being further distributed than it once was, meaning more individuals with coin, but less coins per person.
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:51:20
Will do. I haven't gotten much further than creating an account yet, but will once I have a bit more time. So far so good.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:45:55
At a minimum the scale is different. A comparison of the google trends for Bitcoin in 2011 and now makes that fairly clear:
Not to mention that investors aren't really down on Bitcoin since the price drop. Rather, there seems to be more goods news in regards to startups and investors looking to get into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:00:58
Many things are possible, do you have any evidence to substantiate such claims? I'm not saying it isn't possible, just that it doesn't appear to be the case. Also, it isn't as though early users of Bitcoin had some sort of forsight that no one else did. Their hobby/experiment happened to take hold and is paying off. 
Enrichment of early adopters could turn out to be a good thing. Assuming that early adopters are technologically savvy, I'd be interested in what many of them end up doing with their new found wealth.
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:26:22
I sent them an email yesterday hoping to get something more than just claims of having an ASIC but so far no response. It'd be great to have another ASIC manufacturer and pretty awesome if they managed to pull off a 'stealth' manufature. There's nothing to say that these guys are legitimate yet, though the pictures are promising.
@_date: 2013-05-28 00:37:32
I'd like to see some exchanges supporting JSONP as well. Correct me if I'm wrong but currently even MtGox requires a server side get request just to get current ticket data. An exchange API that supported JSONP would make it so much easier to quickly embed price widgets and other data into Bitcoin related sites.
@_date: 2013-05-13 22:04:47
That's a good point, I hadn't considered how that could benefit people using currencies other than the USD normally.

The Bitcoin protocol isn't going to get any simpler to understand. However, the services built on top of Bitcoin will become simpler to use, and is somewhat a matter of time. There are difficulties, such as not being able to purchase Bitcoin with credit/debit cards, etc. However, services are popping up to make purchasing and using Bitcoin easier.
We've published a few guides with the aim of helping new users navigate the Bitcoin world as is:

@_date: 2013-10-05 17:55:08
Yeah, you're almost certain to not make your money back on these. However, it can be a fun way to learn about Bitcoin mining. I just put together a piece on mining with them:
[Running ASICMiner Block Erupters For Fun, Not Profit](
I had hoped that smaller USB miners like this would be a good entry point for beginning miners, and help to more broadly distribute the block reward. However, it seems that larger, more powerful miners are the only way to go if you're looking to make a decent ROI. It'll be interesting to see how the Bitcoin mining industry evolves over the next six months, with the release of KNC Miner and faster miners like the Cointerra IV. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:59:20
I'm generally not one for speculation as I am unable to predict the future. However, it is certainly possible that the Dollar and Euro may collapse. I also feel as though some remnants of the current financial system will remain, be they FIAT currencies, Stock Exchanges, Banking protocols, or something else. Traditional financial institutions are not well suited for digital commerce, but have adapted out of necessity. If their place online is revoked I'd expect some adaptation to remain relevant in the physical world.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:22:56
Personally I think it's pretty funny.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:04:16
Something like that yeah. Similar events played out with Terracoin earlier this year when large miners jumped onto the coin for a period of time, mined a bunch, then left. It took the Terracoin network a long time to recover and eventually led to changes in its difficulty adjustment algorithm.
If a vast amount of mining power vanished it might be possible to provide an update to the Bitcoin client that adjusted the difficulty at some preset block number, as long as miners/users agreed upon the changes and universally adopted the protocol adjustments. This could decrease the time required for the difficulty adjustment. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:33:43
These guys will be covering the Bitcoin conference in San Jose this weekend too.

@_date: 2013-12-02 15:37:14
They are terms referring to buy and sell orders on an exchange. A **buy wall** is a price point on an exchange with a large amount of buy orders, significantly higher than other price points. A **sell wall** is a large amount of sell orders at a specific price point. 
Generally these are seen as roadblocks to some future price point. For instance, if the price is currently at $999 and there is a large sell wall at $999.90 then the sell wall is seen as preventing the price from rising about $999.90. Similarly buy walls can prevent the price from dropping below a certain amount. 
At times fake buy and sell walls will appear on exchanges. Once the price actually hits that amount the wall simply disappears as the orders are retracted.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:10:31
I respectfully disagree. At the moment there is an influx of new users looking to turn a quick buck on Bitcoin. Once the price stabilizes they'll move on and this subreddit along with other Bitcoin communities will once again focus on the development of Bitcoin, not its price. 
So I suppose in some respects you are right, that at this moment many Bitcoin participants are driven by profit. However, there is a strong core group of Bitcoin users and developers that believe the protocol has great potential to positively improve people's lives and society, or at the very least make online commerce more efficient.
