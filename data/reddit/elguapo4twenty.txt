Did you download Bitcoin core through armory or did you download another version and redirect armory to that version? The reason I ask is because armory doesn't offer the latest Bitcoin core so I had to install it myself and place it in the proper armory folder to access it...

I was just sitting and thinking how in the heck this could of happened. I have been using the same keyboard on the same computer and retyped the password over 50 times in a text editor and have been analyzing the keys which I most commonly mistype. Using this information I have re-attempted the password over 200 times and have still not unlocked it. 
Which had just led me to think maybe my keyboard was in another type of mode like you said. How easy is it to accidentally change the keyboard mapping? I have never consciously done that before.

Socialism is the opposite of free markets. Central banking is the opposite of free markets because an unelected board decide interest rates and not supply and demand. Since an unelected board is not as smart as the economy they get the interest rates wrong and create euphoria until it ends abruptly. Usually when a bubble pops the majority of people don't see it coming.

I think the OP meant its not AS manipulated as gold and other older markets which is true. The amount of institutional investors in crypto is microscopic compared to those other markets.

Im not adviser but this is just my gut feeling (i have studied Austrian Economics since 2008): I think you can make some money buying and selling, but you will for sure make money if you buy low and hold. Everyone's investment horizon is different, and some people need cash now (which is understandable). My strategy is use bitcoin as a savings vehicle/investment. I hope this helps
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:51:11
I never said to spam or be annoying tho. It appears some techies don't understand that business is a two way street and there is nothing wrong with asking for something as long as it is in a respectful way. I do not endorse trolling in the name of bitcoin

The chicken and the egg problem. People don't take bitcoin serious because no one accepts it. When you ask people to start accepting it the people on Reddit say you are spamming and making bitcoin look bad. I guess 90% of asking is how you ask. If you put off that spamming vibe then maybe it's time to grow up. But if you are an adult and act professional then it will probably make bitcoin seem more legit. Basic economics: consumer demands and companies supply
@_date: 2015-04-20 06:49:00
once the price goes back up you will be golden though. its feels burnout because of the price right is so low, its only temporary though. once the economy falters again, and there are plenty of reasons why it would, then investors will want out of paper assets and bitcoin will be there for them
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:42:57
See unlike most bitcoiners I didnt find this technology through being a computer nerd. I have sold home, auto, and life and insurance for NYLife, Humana, and State Farm, and I currently work in Denver as a Petroleum Landman. I found bitcoin through Austrian Economics so my ability to network in a professional arena has already been developed. It appears that a lot of the techies in the bitcoin space are lacking in this department, which is probably why the masses think bitcoin is unattractive.
