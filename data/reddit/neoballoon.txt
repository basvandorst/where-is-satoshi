Likewise -- and he wasn't the only vendor on Silk Road engaged in the sale of legal wares. There were plenty of clothing companies, for example, that likely did not deal in contraband. Of course it's a logistic nightmare to figure out who was and who wasn't, but the whole thing still strikes me as ridiculous. 
If this case goes anywhere (unlikely), it will set a sort of precedent for similar cases.

These things -- great books, pieces of music, movies... They -- even in the least 'generous' definitions of art -- are still valued as a language used to communicate when reason and reason alone is insufficient. 
If you're going to make a claim that the arts and humanities are useless by design and merely forms of entertainment, then you should be prepared to explain why you think this is true.

Wow they're really stretching this justification. The utility of bitcoin increases its value, so if your idea is ripped off and bitcoin's utility is increased, any BTC that you have will increase in value. Okay. We can all agree on that. 
But this argument isn't going to be of much consolation to the person who generated the ripped off idea. It's a pretty esoteric argument that demonstrates little to no understanding of missed profits or opportunity cost.

@_date: 2014-01-21 01:35:25
This is a well reasoned comment,  and I would hope that bitcoin idealists would at least consider the implications. I see deflation as the most significant problem posed by to true widespread adoption. This historical argument makes little sense when we consider -- as you've noted -- that most of the history of human economics is agrarian economies with precious metal-backed currencies. There are reasons why the world's economies transitioned away from such currencies. 
The thing is, deflation only becomes a significant problem if you consider its use on a macro level, as in major widespread adoption with a large percentage of transactions and investments taking place in BTC. I think this is what will prevent bitcoin from becoming a serious vehicle for mass transactions and investments.

It's a jerk because many of those in the STEM fields sort of smugly think that their 'usefulness' or societal utility is somehow rendering the arts &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; humanities obsolete -- for some, this seems like some kind of utopian-technocratic fantasy, a world in which all current problems are solved by STEM and STEM alone. All the answers are in STEM. Even the human brain is [no different from a computer running an algorithm]( 
Things like literature, poetry, critical theory, visual arts, dance, cinema, etc are of little value in a STEM world. I know this isn't all stemmers, but there's an undeniable -- albeit sometimes subtle -- dismissal of the arts &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; humanities that permeates their dialogue.  These unscientific things are "fluff", a waste of time, juvenile even. 
And returning to the computational theory of mind referenced above, I think the popularity of that argument is in large part indebted to experts in neuroscience, physics, computer science, etc, practicing philosophy of the mind. Which in itself isn't a problem, but these thinkers are sometimes out of their element and don't seem to appreciate philosophy as a rigorous discipline unto itself. We even have Stephen Hawking -- perhaps the most popular STEM ambassador (along with DeGrasse, Michion Kaku, et. al.) -- claiming that ["Philosophy is Dead"]( He says, "Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."
I don't find that latter claim controversial per se -- but I think the cult of STEM will take it to some absurd extreme where science is the *only* way by which we can learn more about the human experience and the universe. The arts &amp;amp;amp;amp; humanities cannot offer insight when it comes to these "big questions". That first claim though -- that philosophy is dead -- I find laughable. And it's not a fringe idea, it's one that I see pop up frequently in the STEM community, where many are quick to dismiss any and all ideas that are not strictly scientific as fluff. The realm of STEM starts to feel comically religious or dogmatic, and that's why it's a "jerk".

That's why I used the example of the shipping magnate using his clout and relationships to get an entire industry to adopt an altcoin. The shift may not be the result of a better product, but rather politics. This happens all the time in business.
Further, case studies show that first to market isn't always an advantageous position. Subsequent entrants get the benefit of listening to the first's mistakes. So the claim that the bitcoin protocol is in a more ideal position because it is first to market isn't entirely convincing. 
That said, I want btc to succeed, I just like to maintain a healthy cautiousness.

The bitcoin experiment is interesting for this reason. We saw after the Reagan years what deregulation does to certain industries, right? It rarely ends well, particularly for the customer. If you are going to be a proponent of an unregulated commodity/currency such as bitcoin, then you must understand the implications of an unregulated commodity/currency. 
When we look at recent bitcoin events (like Mt. Gox and Sheep), it's clear that customers and users have pretty much zero recourse when it comes to getting cheated. Now that's acceptable for somewhere like Sheep, a marketplace catering explicitly to the exchange of contraband. Getting robbed on the darknet is par for the course. But it's a different picture when you look at Mt. Gox. 
Hate on regulatory institutions all you want, but the reason something like the FDIC exists is ultimately to protect consumers. It's an insurance plan for your money. If somebody hacks Chase tomorrow and steals a bunch of your money, then you're pretty much guaranteed your money back. 
Now, if you start to make bitcoin more "secure", it actually starts to look a lot like fiat currencies with all their regulatory baggage. You can imagine a massive institutional bitcoin insurer (private or *gasp* governmental) popping up in the future when bitcoin stabilizes as a currency, that may resemble something like the FDIC or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), which exists to insure credit unions. These things -- even with all their flaws and baggage -- do provide confidence and stability. 
Deregulated industriees-- and currencies, as we're starting to see --  run wild, they revel in their new freedom. This can be good and this can be bad. But history seems to suggest that it almost invariably leads to [someone getting hurt]( It's just difficult to predict whom. Regulating bitcoin will certainly add friction to our once frictionless dream, but maybe a little friction is necessary. 
You're exactly right; we asked for a deregulated currency, and that's exactly what we're getting.

These are platitudes at best. The truth is, that when one goes through loss, it is okay to feel it. It is okay to feel miserable and despondent.

That's exactly what I meant by easier to use... Better infrastructure. I'm not saying it's likely, but I do think that's it's possible that an altcoin comes onto the scene whose backers and community are more motivated and  have the resources to build an infrastructure with components that are say, more retailer friendly, than bitcoin's. An altcoin could pop up with an infrastructure supported by a few wealthy individuals with the right industry connections. 
Consider this: some random shipping magnate decides that he really likes this new altcoin and builds out an infrastructure to support it. Using his clout and connections, he gets the big players in his industry to hop on board this infrastructure, and now you have a an entire industry carrying out massive transactions in that altcoin. You can see how this hypothetical is problematic.

This is the number one thing that scares me about bitcoin: replaceability. With fiat currency, you essentially need an army to replace a currency.

It doesn't matter how pointless the revelation will be, people will still be curious. Maybe you can tame your own curiosity, but many of us can't -- even those of us who *know* that his real identity is irrelevant. The fact is that humans are curious, and that's why they care. Type in "Satoshi" into the search bar over there and see the level of curiousity yourself. It's absolutely silly to tell people not to be curious about something that they're curious about. It's like telling someone not to picture their mom naked.

I agree with you on things like trustless systems. I think these developments are absolutely critical to the success of bitcoin not only as a commodity but also as a currency.

Right that's what I mean by pseudonymous. Wallets are not intrinsically attached to identities. But the *movement* of coins itself is by nature public, via the blockchain. That's what we mean when we say that there is spatial and temporal information that a motivated enough entity could use to narrow down suspected coin owners. With cash, the transaction itself needn't be recorded anywhere as part of some chain. And you definitely don't need any form of id to use cash.
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:22:07

I've just seen people say that when you use the bot to tip for the first time, the bot will create a wallet for you, which doesn't make sense, unless it creates the wallet, waits for you to xfer btc into the wallet, and then completes the transaction.

Question: where do bitcoin tips come from? For example, I have 0 BTC, but if I perform the tip function on another redditor for 1 BTC, does the bot simply reject the command? Or is there a debit of 1 BTC that now exists somewhere?
