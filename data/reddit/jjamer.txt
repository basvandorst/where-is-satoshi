This is already decided. Only a few people have commit access to the official code repository. 
So, they can do whatever they want basically, as far as the changes/decisions they make keeps miners and users happy.

1) Who decides who's in the list or out? Based on what criteria? Does each person have an equal vote? How long do they stay in the "committee"? Do they need to be software developers, or they will just be there to tell the developers what to do?
2) Some of those people (or similar) have tried to "fork away" bitcoin to create altcoins with no success so far. What's different this time?
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:05:58
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:16:16
1) So, you are suggesting a few of those people get together and create altcoins? Fine. What to do with bitcoin though?

There is something seriously wrong with the numbers in this site. It is currently saying that volatility is close to 3%, while the price has dropped more than 30% from a month ago!

@_date: 2014-11-09 15:43:56
This doesn't make a lot of sense. The whole point of loyalty programs is to redeem the points with services by the company issuing them. Why would a company want to tie the value of those points to the volatility of bitcoin, rather than a company-controlled depreciation schedule?
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:09:49

@_date: 2014-07-16 13:59:48
the service could be design such as every month both the user and the business need to sign a transaction for the service to be continued. if one of the two doesn't sign, then the funds are not transfered from the user to the business, therefore the service is canceled.
why does this not work?

@_date: 2014-07-18 21:08:30
It would be cheaper to pay them in cash. When paying with bitcoin, the recipient will have to convert back to USD, so there is big volatility risk + 1% fee to do that.
I don't see the benefit at all.

Bitcoin is a software protocol like TCP/IP. People don't have to understand it and it can still work, assuming that it does some things better compared to the old system.
The problem right now for me is that bitcoin doesn't help me do anything in a better way.
I can't use it as a currency because it's too volatile. I can't use it to pay for anything because my credit cards give me a lot more cash back. I can't use it for legal applications because it's not legal tender. I just can't find any use for it.
I believe that's the main problem that most people are facing right now, they just don't know why and where they should use it and for what benefit.

That person/team owns 1 million bitcoins. It matters.
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:39:28
that's completely wrong. if nobody sold any of their coins, the price would be a lot higher.
with such high volatility, bitcoin is not a good currency. it's much closer to a commodity instead.
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:05:12
So, the argument that bitcoin volatility will drop as the bitcoin economy grows seems to be false. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:08:45
that means we are still in the early stages, maybe a good time to buy more ?
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:25:08
Given that so few people in the world know or use bitcoin at the moment, doesn't that mean that bitcoin is essentially a pre-mined coin owned by less than 1% of the world population?

I don't know about you guys, but I am REALLY, REALLY happy with the price drop.
In fact, the ideal scenario would be for the price to drop to $100 or lower. I can then buy tens of coins and hopefully at least double my money when the price recovers!
I can't wait, hopefully we get there soon.
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:48:38

Bitcoin mining will become way more centralized compared to traditional currencies together. In the end, up to 10 or fewer big mining operations will do all the mining, while for fiat currencies you still have 100s of countries issuing their own.

@_date: 2014-07-08 00:59:01
Actually, I was wondering if there was a way to act in this case.
For example, let's say you get a notification immediately after someone has tried to spend your coins. Would you be able to immediately initiate your own transactions to try to send your coins to another one of your addresses, hoping that the miners will process your transaction instead?
Do you know if that would work? Maybe if you included a nice fee with it?
So, you would essentially try to double-spend, but for good reasons.
@_date: 2014-07-01 00:33:56
did you win?
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:38:13
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:49:52
As a business, you have no incentive to do that at the moment, unless you want to speculate on the price of bitcoin.
That's why almost all businesses that use bitpay convert immediately to USD.

Makes total sense. There is no way bitcoin will succeed as a currency, because it's too volatile. People will try to say that eventually volatility will drop, but that is just not true.
Gold has been around for thousands of years, it has great adoption and 7 trillion $ of market cap and it's still very volatile. What makes you think bitcoin will be less volatile with bigger adoption?
On the opposite front, currencies like the dollar, euro, yen, etc.. are a lot less volatile, not because of market forces, but because the central banks that issue them are making sure they buy and sell the right time to reduce volatility of each currency. Nobody is incentivized to do that for bitcoin, or gold and that's why they are and they will remain volatile.
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:21:15

@_date: 2014-07-14 15:06:06
And the type of wallets they are offering keeps getting better. For example, multi-sig and cold storage with more safeguards.
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:09:22
Right, but do they keep the bitcoins or will they just convert immediately to USD?
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:13:05
yes, because you can read the code and verify yourself.

@_date: 2014-06-28 17:23:24
Why not? What if you believed there is more upside?
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:48:12
No, for the following reasons:
a) Bitcoin price is volatile. What if the price of bitcoin drops by 10% and now you can only buy 10% less supplies? This is unacceptable for any business.
b) Bitcoin transactions are not exactly free. There is a fee you have to pay to the miners and it's currently not that small
c) Since bitcoin is treated as a commodity, you have to pay realized capital gain taxes if you buy something with it. This is very inconvenient for the business and they will need special costly software to support these types of transactions.

Tim Draper is a proven investor and therefore he must have good reasons to pay a certain high price for bitcoins. Which makes me think that he feels Bitcoin is very undervalued at the moment, therefore the price must go much higher from here.
Given that most VCs don't try to buy anything, unless the price at least doubles or goes up 10x, it mean that bitcoin could have a lot of potential to further appreciate from current levels.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:27:11

@_date: 2014-07-19 04:00:23
That's still big for micro-transactions. In addition, there is a possibility that transaction costs will go up, with the mining reward going down as we approach 21 million.
@_date: 2014-07-23 00:20:19
the price needs to stay low until wall street buys as much as they can. after that, it might go up..

We don't all own 1 million bitcoins
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:39:03
It's still very stressful, because there is nothing you can do if the coins get stolen. So, to my original question, what's the point?
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:18:43

BitcoinB might worth less than BitcoinA but what if BitcoinB is serving a specific use case better than BitcoinA? It would still be relevant and useful.
For example, BitcoinB might be used to transfer money between China and the US and BitcoinA could be used for fast and reliable payments within the US.
Also, what if BitcoinB is initially worse but after a new software release becomes better than BitcoinA? People might keep switching between the two while both co-exist. People have switched from Macs to PCs and back to Macs.

Some value does not mean they should be worth 1000s of $. Bitcoin still works right now and it will still work if the price drops and stays below $100. Any reason to believe otherwise?

Bitcoin foundation is not very different from your typical central bank. A few people holding all the power for the future of bitcoin. 
They are making their own decisions without any external vote.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:18:28
Hm, what if Gavin wants to increase the number of bitcoins to 21 billion in the future because "it makes sense" ?
It looks like anything can change, it's just code written by humans and controlled by humans.

Agree, but those were not on a public ledger and they were not backed by mining.
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:03:02
Not sure I was understood. I meant to be able to add an attached take-profit order.
For example:
I want to post a limit order to buy 1 BTC at $400 and that same order will have attached another order to sell 1 BTC at $401. So, if the order to buy at $400 is executed, then the attached order becomes live as well.
I don't think I can do that right now, right?
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:42:58
BitcoinB doesn't have to have any major flaws for BitcoinA to exist. They just serve different use cases and each one is engineered specifically to work well in each case.
An example is TCP vs UDP. UDP is better than TCP for certain use cases and they both co-exist on top of IP.
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:27:37
5 years ago you could do that. Now you actually have to be able to pay big sums to buy strong enough hardware for mining to make sense. So, no, effectively you can't.
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:16:27
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:23:06
Would be nice if they implemented take-profit orders as well

The dollar looks very predictable in the last 30 years. Bitcoin is completely unpredictable and can go up or down 100% or more in one month for no reason whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:28:33
this makes sense
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:24:26
Unless bitcoin becomes more cost-effective and easier to use compared to existing payment systems, there is no point to try to convince anyone to use it.
It's the equivalent of trying to convince people to use the Internet back in 1985, just because you thought TCP/IP was cool.
I still don't see any obvious case to use bitcoin anywhere.
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:43:21
Do you know many people who own IP addresses?

This is like saying that we don't need iPhones, since you can do the same things on Android and Android devices are cheaper.
And we don't need reddit or twitter, because we can talk to each other through email.

The price is falling because there is not enough demand for using bitcoin. Other than wanting to speculate with the price, there is no other reason where you would really need to use bitcoin right now.
There is also no demand for saving data in the blockchain because nobody wants/needs to read it back. So even if you see the blockchain as a distributed database, it is certainly not very useful right now.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:36:49
Are you saying there is no utility in owning bitcoin other than wanting to show off?
Given all the negative press about bitcoin over the last 2 years, it will be very hard to convince other people that it is a status symbol, unless you are talking to extremely technical people who understand the algorithm.
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:38:05
yeah, right

2/3 of bitcoins already exist, but less than 1% of the people worldwide are using bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-03-19 14:40:08
It can, but you won't be able to get rates that are competitive to a centralized exchange due to the efficiency of centralization.

What if someone steals your files and they certify them in this website before you notice?
And, from a legal perspective, do you guarantee that this certification will be considered as legal proof at a court?

why now?
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:41:17
An idea by itself is not worth that much. It's the actual implementation that matters.
I disagree that no one can steal something if they don't know it exists.  What if someone hacks into Apple's or Google's computers, steals some of their secret projects and then tries to claim ownership?

More evidence that bitcoin was built by the NSA.
