Pretty sure you can't trade csgo stuff for at least 24 hours after purchase,  so it's easy for them to remove the items from your inventory if that's necessary.

What's the name of the pub? I should stop by the next time I'm in Denmark. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 17:54:09
Definitely, but I've never actively looked for one! I only go to the mainstream places, tbh. Strøget, Nyhavn, etc. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:22:45
no it doesn't. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:48:19
You'd think so but you'd be wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:14:31
Trump won because of idiotic conversations on the bitcoin sub?
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:08:43
It's not exactly something that anyone needs to know. Just a piece of useless trivia. No need to be rude about already knowing it. Just thought it was interesting and wanted to share. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:07:07
Yeah, apparently they gave up on it almost immediately. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:56:42
I have no idea what this has to do with anything. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:06:27
I guess many of the people here already knew it, but I thought it was super interesting and also really surprising. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:48:34
What's a good free IQ test?
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:32:54
Haha, no. For mortals like us, mining isn't feasible at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:17:07
we made it
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:49:27
haha WOW that was an epic reference for the win xD
@_date: 2016-11-07 08:26:40
On top of what everyone else is saying, your bad joke doesn't even make any sense. If someone asks her for debit or credit,  they're doing the opposite of assuming her tender. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 08:24:20
You clearly implied you had jokes. Quit stalling.
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:52:12
Then why does everyone cling onto the lie that Pao was responsible for firing that mod? Because FPH was already mad at her for not allowing them to bully. This whole bullshit drama will have blown over soon, and the only people to have left to voat will be the FPH retards 
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:38:31
That is a lie. The person was not fired by the CEO, she was fired by a Reddit founder. 
This whole mess is fueled by the FPH crowd. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:42:29
Except people didn't leave Digg because harassment was disallowed or because an employee was fired. People left because of fundamental changes to the site, which in general made the content much worse. No such thing has happened here. If anything, with the FPH people having left the site, the content is better.
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:28:54
I have no idea what you're talking about, but the subs that I subscribe to are still plenty active. 
As I implied earlier, I have no problem with people like you leaving the site. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:29:18
And your mistake is assuming that drama will drive enough people away to make reddit lose relevancy. 
What happened with Digg was a drastic change in the site's functionality, which changed things for the worse. No such thing has happened on Reddit.
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:34:24
Your "proof" requires people to go through the lengthy process of setting up a complicated site and getting a community and then waiting for a lawsuit for an unspecified amount of time. You're relying on the fact that no one will do this in order to make it seem like you have any idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:45:59
I have no idea what you're trying to say with that comment. Why don't you just say what you think?
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:55:19
Hahaha what a story
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:22:26
Wouldn't a decentralised system have a huge problem with scammers?
@_date: 2016-02-09 19:56:41
I'm not talking about Bitcoin, I'm talking about a hypothetical decentralized games distribution platform. Clearly such a platform should be able to compete with Steam. 
As for your actual condescending (and allegedly serious but come on) question, I'm obviously not going to give you an answer. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 20:56:33
That looks quite interesting. I'm definitely going to read up on it. Sounds very promising. I personally don't like the term "open" for software that's obviously intended to go mainstream, because most people have no idea what that term means. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:00:44
Your ridiculous attempt at shaming me for that question does nothing but to show how bad this community can be. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:49:05
What is it like to be completely insane? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:49:05
What is it like to be completely insane? 
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:03:11
Hence, it's not a fact. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:19:04
They're all retarded morons who think they're changing the world by being retarded morons and talking about pizza pedophiles. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 20:27:23
My original argument that there is nothing wrong with writing a complaint about something you don't like is impossible to dismiss. All you've said is that it's a waste of time, but the time wasted is so insignificant that it's irrelevant. 
How am I discrediting anyone who opposes Core? All I'm doing is discrediting *you*, because you're clearly insane. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:54:45
Seems to me that the only one with a stick up a butt is you. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:16:40
That's up to Amazon to decide. There's nothing wrong with complaining that their service is being used for something you don't like. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:23:56
So? All I said is that there is nothing wrong with it. Everyone is free to complain. At worst nothing will happen and at best something will happen. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 20:20:10
Bitcoin people have an understandable tendency to get overly emotional and defensive over nothing. Take a cold shower and reread my comment chain. Consider this: are your little rants and calls of conspiracy really worth my comments?
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:41:42
Screw this, I'm going back to @_date: 2017-06-22 09:46:27
