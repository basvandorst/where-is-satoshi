CEO of Mercado Bitcoin has stated the following in another thread about them:
My name is Rodrigo Batista and I run MercadoBitcoin.com.br since May.
This is the first time I use Reddit to communicate and I just want just to clarify things about us here (please ignore my English mistakes):
Mercado Bitcoin is the first Bitcoin exchange created in Brazil, in 2011, and it is one of the oldest in the world. I’m glad we are the biggest Bitcoin company in Latin America and also one of the top 25 Exchanges in Bitcoin Charts.
Our website was indeed compromised in March in the same time that it happened with many exchanges around the world that time. After the hack I some friends invested in the webite because I do believe in Bitcoins and I had satisfactory explanations from site creator.
I and my partners have paid every client of the site to down to the last penny. The money flew from my personal cash account directly to the clients that had any lost. The last payment was done on July 25th and almost all the users that had bitcoins with us at the time are still active clients. If someone client say that we did no pay, please just give me the user name and I can send all the receipts.
After the security breach we hired a security audit company  and they have been working with us since May. We have implemented other security measures such as EV SSL, a better cold wallet, client limits and we are improving our security every day.
We are doing our best to make bitcoin Brazilian market more mature and I do think we are being very successful. Initiatives like the doodle we launched last week  are putting Brazil in the Bitcoin map.
However, in Brazil there is a commercial fight going on, and some of the competitors are struggling to live. My only recommendation to them is start doing a good job for yourself and for Bitcoin community in Brazil, instead of trying to harm every initiative Mercado Bitcoin is doing.
We are very, very, happy to have one of the biggest communications company in the world trying bitcoins. It is time to celebrate!!!

From what I heard, Mercado Bitcoin has paid off all the clients that suffered from the hack. Also, Leandro seems to be paying the clients of BitcoinRain and he is no longer partner of MercadoBitcoin.com.br.

Just realized that they convert the BTCUSD to Real, using dollar quote. They should get the data of BitcoinCharts, or some other bitcoin related website.

andrehorta, you forgot mentioning:
* You own a creepy competitor to MercadoBitcoin.net 
* You filled a case in court and you lost 
* Leandro is no longer partner of the company (since 2013)

I am pretty sure what they are doing is **illegal**.
According to the Brazilian agreements with FIFA, people cannot use theirs logos and even refer to the world World Cup to promote their services. 
Those agreements end up with the creation of tons of new laws that protect FIFA's and their sponsors interests in the World Cup.
Visa is a major sponsor.
Just as an example, in the last World cup some women were sent to jail because they were promoting a beer brand wearing orange dresses: 
I have seen many other situations like that.
I'm not saying that I agree with this legislation, but it exists and they use it.
All we dont need is Bitcoin name involved in illegal/dubious activities **again**.

If that is a lie, should not people just sue them and send them to jail?

this exactly what they state about the chart:
"Client Downloads
 
Bitcoin client download figures are proving less reliable as an absolute 
measure of adoption, now that ever more consumer friendly layers are 
built on top of core bitcoin infrastructure. That said, an interesting story can still unfold when observing relative trends. For example, we looked at the top 30 countries on the list of all-time bitcoin client downloads, comparing their total downloads at the end of June with their total downloads at the end of September. What we found was measurable data to support prevailing hypotheses surrounding bitcoin adoption trends. 
Among the highest proportional increases were countries like Argentina 
and India, both of which have recently seen significant inflation and 
capital controls, two core drivers in 2013 of global adoption. Also near 
the top of the list is Italy, whose third largest bank is currently amidst abail-in scenario. While Monte dei Paschi’s bail-in will target bondholders first, it was the Cyprus bail-ins targeting depositors that led to the March bitcoin boom. Notably, other nations in the Euro periphery are also near the top of the list, as they were around the time of the Cypriot financial crisis. "
