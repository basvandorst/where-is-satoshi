I like the sub text. Bitcoin cash is rubbish!

Why thank you, so polite! Just trying to help out in case anyone can't read the Japanese text.

Yeah most people have no idea about that. I saw this article on my Facebook feed, comments are what you'd expect - lots of 'haha I told you it'll crash',  'the founder of Bitcoin is pulling out' etc. Oh well.

I actually tried to set it straight with some info about Bitcoin .com and BCH, but my comment was immediately blocked as spam by SMH.

'BitFlyer only'

That's a possibility, but btc is still generally fungible. You can't say cash is not fungible just because the government may have the power to freeze assets in a bank account.

Sorry, how is Bitcoin not fungible? If I have 1 btc in one wallet, and another 1 btc in another wallet, they are mutually interchangeable and i can swap them and end up with the same value in each wallet. I can also stack them in a single wallet worth 2 btc.
Sure technically at a low level the transaction trace is different, but value remains the same.

Agree, devaluation was obviously a huge concern for SN, and is the reason he embedded in the blockchain.

Perfect response. Thank you

They already have something like this working with Nano currency - check out Nano Quake:

Well said

I wrote something in kotlin recently to load in my order history from various exchanges, cross reference with price data to common pairing currencies, and calculate gains/loss per currency fifo at every taxable event. Wasn't that hard :)

Surprisingly compact. Does it dispense cash as well or pound-&gt;BTC only? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:14:28
That did look a bit odd!

I think this is because you need an account with bitFlyer to be able to use Bitcoin at bic camera, so bitFlyer takes on the risk. At least that was how it was when I checked there in April and found I couldn't use Bitcoin directly.
