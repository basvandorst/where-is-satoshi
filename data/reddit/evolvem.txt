Personally i would not be here now if it were not for coinbase. I'm late adopter and didn't start researching bitcoin till i saw Dell took it as payment and then found coinbase ( when searching how to buy some coins).  As a result, i'm a 5 figure buy in of BTC post gox.  Bitcoin needs large businesses and brands behind it if it wants to get the large capital on board. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:19:23
No one here believes bitcoin should or can have any type of successful regulation . I defeats the whole concept of it.
AML and KYC should only be on the Government issued layer(where Digital currency is exchanged to fiat, OR a decentralized digital currency is exchanged to centralized digital currency ( bitcoin -&gt; colored US dollar  ). 
Since something like bitcoin is not owned or issued by any central government, AML and KYC should always be outside of the decentralized digital currency echosphere . This gives every government/ jurisdiction the ability to have their own regulation that they should rightfully have.
ChainAnchor and its current idea is honestly a waste of research resources . The idea may be useful for a govt issued colored coin but then the whole concept is in the toilet because you would not have miners in the way bitcoin does if in a govt issued asset.

It's a great goal, i agree. I'm not sure how realistic it is though in our lifetime. Govt is govt, it cant function without being able to issues its debt to pay for its stuff . You will never be able to pay taxes in bitcoin because it undermines the legitimacy of the government . govt fiat will exists as long as the govt owns land and military. In the end it comes down to "who can kill who" and part of the value of the USD is the fact the govt owns geographical assets with the military power securing value of the dollar as well. The whole point of abandoning the gold standard was to derive value of money form total land, military value and economic activity and issue debt. This is why they can inflate indefinitely and continue to do so. Bitcoin will co-exsist with fiat but its value will be much much higher, but fiat will not go away or the govt system currently with it . 
Regarding the candidates, Rand Paul is the only one that would get as close to all of the above future you outline. The article above is inaccurate about trump and banks. He is a developer. The business works via collateralize loans from investment banks to build projects and not hold up capital. His activities with banks are not politically but business related, unlike the others. This is common sense, we all do the same thing when buying a house and getting a mortgage only on a much smaller scale. Trump is actually the only real outsider and using his own funds in addition to being overtly vocal about corruption and fraud in the system. Sanders may come off as an outsider but  he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1990 and served until 2006 when he was elected into the U.S. Senate where he has served ever since. Sanders will quickly bend to the establishment when he is secured a nomination because he has been part of the establishment for 26 years.  Trump is the only non political candidate we have right now( if this is something you value ).

In a recession there's a higher demand for dollars to pay down debt. This is is very visual when stocks sell off and the dollar rises( risk taking is tuned down and parked into the dollar). On the flip side, there's the fed lowering rates and pumping cash into the system to encourage debt/risk taking economic activity. The govt will also be tax hunting more( bitcoin positive). I think bitcoin is too small in its own echo sphere thus can prosper in any economic condition . Its really subject to new large players "buying into " bitcoin. It's just not a main player yet and the masses don't consider it as part of the system( we are talking about a 7 bil economy absorbing fractions of trillions of dollars).  If bitcoin holds up well in a recession and rises, investors with parked cash might consider researching it and parking some cash into it. At this point it's a matter of how many and how big those new players and adopters are.

If bitcoin had a user base only 10% the size of the facebook userbase and had an average buy in/ ongoing activity of $1500 for each person that would add 150bil to the bitcoin market cap. Bitcoin can get to a higher market cap than facebook with a fraction of people using it assuming the useres are buying into bitcoin and constantly using it. This is all hypothetical but not unrealistic at all . it's a low ball estimate imo

"There will be no mass adoption of Bitcoin like with smartphones. Bitcoin will be the hidden backbone."
But this is a good thing . Bitcoin being the backbone for other uses, including expanding fiat movement, is how mass adoption of the BTC currency can sneak in over time . This selling point that people need to rid fiat NOW for bitcoin will never "sell" bitcoin adoption and it will NOT sell big investments into tech innovations that use btc blockchain unless there is a middle ground and a focus on tech. I think what circle did is great as long as they continue to use the blockchain.   The more mainstream tech that uses the btc blockchian the more it will secure future value of BTC store unit of value because large infrastructure for other uses will depend on it. When you combine infrastructure dependency then LARGE capital will start looking and understanding the supply/demand and all economic factors that value bitcoin. This will let BTC explode in the years to come to the tone of over 1 trillion in market cap.

the only risk with china is if the govt changes the sub electricity costs and issues with the firewall, other than that this speculation is unknown just like the risks are for any govt action in the US and EU . I think a lot of the worry with china is ideology of "China owning everything" .  The Chinese mining community are multiple enthusiasts and business owners just like everyone else in the community around the world and the community needs to respect that and not assume they are one ball of conspiracy. Honestly the bigger problem than mining % is the lack of communication and language barrier with the china community. I really believe If the worst happened with china the BTC community would come together pick up the slack.
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:12:18
I disagree with everything here, there's a lot of conspiracy theory in what you are saying, or maybe its just your interpretation . My mothers father came to the US when he was 40 with nothing in the 60's and provided for his family working in a factory, taking the bus every day to work. My father grow up in the US poor, his first job was sorting metal at a trash dump. He eventually worked his way up to a role at Xerox after school and became middle class. What you fail to realize is the world is not developed like the US, its only been developing in the last 30 years . 
"we want to bring the poor out of poverty, but the system depends on the captive poor labor remaining poor." - This is just not true, people have to earn their way through life and there are more govt programs now to help with this than ever in history .  The rest of the world is still developing so labor is cheaper. As a global business why would you hire an american worker under unions , minimum wage protests and insurance+Tax costs when you can go to another country that has no taxes, and cheaper labor ? The US is not competitive in the world because we are now competing with  the world as it becomes more developed . America over-taxes businesses and citizens for their money inflation, war spending and growing social programs to make "everyone equal" instead of loosening up the system and lowering its foot print to let people build their own future and attractive capital from the world. I personally have moved all my assets overseas, via getting a dual citizenship and put all more entities in Nevis. America is going to the socialist toilet. I will leave the country if sanders tax plans actually became active. I'm probably speak for many who have the ability to take action and protect themselves.

Btc is still recovering from gox and silk road . when people hear bitcoin, they either don't know what it is and if they do and haven't used it, they think it's a fake ponzi currency used by drug dealers and makes you a target for hackers. This is the publc perception of bit. I think 2016 is the year BTC moves beyond this. VC and fintech are upticking and transactions are on the rise. Wallets and exchages have been greatly innovated. The next age of public perception will be revised when we get another large price move and some innovation ( segwit , ln etc ) .

I read in your original post it says you gave people 15% off when using bitcoin. I think advertising this you opened up too many questions from customers because people immediately want more details when they see a discount they can't use. I think you should try again and leave it as a payment option with no discount. People who have it will know what it is and use it, others will ignore it.

it's more than network effect.  Bitcoin's growth was organic. Every altcoin is created with the hindsight that bitcoin went from 0-1300 and wants to replicate that growth. This factor diminishes the value and store of value of an altcoin in any condition they are created.

I would say we are in 3 but also in 1 at the same time. I think to clear stage 1 for good, bitcoin needs to make a new high. The masses will always assume its a failure while below the bubble high. Sadly, the main stream first cares about news... People making and losing large sums of cash is what they want to hear about. Just reading about tech advancements is not interesting to the masses. The last set of news Bitcoin left to the main stream is "the price crashed due to crooks". This will stick until that high is surpasses no matter what. If the $1200+ high can be surpassed + maintained the masses will start looking at it again to see "what they missed", "why did it not fail?", "who made how much?" etc.. then they will start the research and find out about the evolution of money and why bitcoin is over 1k etc..

Hi David, im a 14+ year FOREX industry vet. If people want to see the future of bitcoin regulation, take a look at what happened to the FX industry in the US over the last 16 years. If Bitcoin is declared a currency of any sort, the required net capital to even be in the game will require millions of collateral and be under the microscope of the NFA watchdog. Technology should not be developed to cater to government regulation because there's not just one government. Every jurisdiction has its own rules. Bitcoin businesses will simply move offshore just like the FX industry did and the jurisdictions with friendly regulation will gain that business. US fumbled in the FX industry and the UK, Cyprus, Malta and AUS regions dominated the FX space.  So my point is, no one will shut down, business will simple move. Regulation and corp jurisdiction is a competitive global marketplace. Keep the technology pure and separate from regulation so the regulation marketplace can do its own thing. The big factor with bitcoin is, you don't need a passport to make a bitcoin address and there is nothing that can prevent that.

Again , more negative from him.. .Fear mongering about the halving... its simply inaccurate, miners have sated they plan to keep running after the halving, many of them have prepaid electricity contracts for the year.   More divisions now will only delay BIP9 and segwit which has the only chance to activate before the halving. With Classic a 5%, this is starting to look like Hern/XT kicking and crying on the way out

Market cap needs to be over 300 billion to be stable imo . It would obviously need a better btc economy to get there but once it's at a higher market cap , small value trading will cause much less volatility than it does now

Need bip 9 and CSV to activate. Just under 40% now, then segwit can roll out

I don't think they are a scam but k didn't like their signup process . Something about them is 'off' so i never used them. Imo these exchanges need to add live chat support

i would do this as well. You could even do small buys with the same exchange without depositing all at once.  bitfinex is pretty liquid 
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:54:31
i would shoot an email to rootstock.io and ask them , they have a live testnet but you need to be granted access. Right now i think its for testing by miners etc..

Personally I think alt coins are another method of obtaining bitcoin . its hard to mine btc but you mine an alt, pump it up, then exchange it for btc. This is the true nature behind atls IMO, etherium included  
@_date: 2016-05-30 03:18:46
Seriously , fuck coinbase. I say it not just because they added ethereum , it's because they tried to kick bitcoin while it was down to try and desperately benefit off a 2 day ethereum hype . Egg in their face now.

People think of it in terms of coins but I think of it as right now 2 million dollars a day is being dumped on the market and after the half and it will be 1 million. I really don't think this is priced in completely. I think at the least nothing happens at all and the people that are buying now and get disappointed and sell on the same day will be offset by the difference in coins created that week
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:09:47
well, not sure about all exchanges but when you make a profit using margin ( going long) on bitfinex the profit is paid in USD. In order to get the profit into BTC , you need to close the position using claim and your position will be sold off and the Profit in USD is sold for bitcoin on the exchange and returned to your balance. The other option is to close out then use the USD profit by moving it to the exchange area of bitfinex and buy coins . A lot of people don't realize that margined longs (in profit), on finex, have real bullish implications if they close out and are claiming profit in BTC or taking the USD balance and buying coins after closing the trade.

Well.. not sure we can base it on how much money goes into Bticoin... let me ask this question, is $1mill USD buying bitcoin increasing the market cap by 1 million? or is it increasing MC for what that $1mill buyer is now willing to sell coins for? One day that 1mil buyer could think it's worth selling for a loss but the same buyer could also think it's not worth selling it for $50 million worth. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 19:03:10
I think its more likely fiat could collapse/inflate, stocks crash, housing collapse  or lose my job than bitcoin failing so i'm not really worried. im always buying more than spending so if we drop ill just be able to buy at lower prices. if bitcoin failed to the point it's worth zero i would be more upset about bitcoin failing than losing my money . 
@_date: 2016-07-06 23:52:59
Yes it's going to dump, sell if your only reason for buying is the halving

I don't think it's an uneven playing field because the market is a free market. Regardless, i dont think bitcoin will be a universal currency, but it will replace offshore banking and serve as a strong store unit of value . That alone makes it extremely undervalued today.

Sounds like things at R3 are not so good. They also need to compete with other companies like chain . Imo this whole private block sector will be a wash. By they time they all develop and go through the process of bidding for the clients public chains will be far ahead. How will they deal with banks that choose differnt private solutions and they need to Intereconnect? It's going to be a mess

Users with wealth are not storing with alt coins. Alt coins will be obsolete via side chains in the next 2 years. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:21:00
Litecoin Has nothing to do with btc while it's in its own chain. 
Litecoin would make a good side chain for bitcoin. Only then would it be appropriate to call it milibitcoin. Here it could be used for faster payments and a different  pricing unit . 1000=mBTC = 1 BTC.

I see zero value in eth as a store of wealth. Didn't need software bugs or the dao to make this opinion, the 60million coin premine and 12 million developer fund was all I need to know. Eth is an altcoin. The only purpose for altcoins are to eventually be sold for btc when they execute the endgame

He gets away with nothing. If people want to understand how much of a troll this guy is please read  by him posted the day before the bitcoin rally  . This guy is a pump n dump troll and this article is right on time with the recent r/btc FUD and the approach of the halving. Sadly, this camp is betting/hoping for something negative to happen at the halving and are pre-positioning themselves . Get ready for more of it all week.

Ditto on circle. Getting instant transactions with debit card and no fees. Also don't have to wait 7 days to get my coin like I did with coinbase.
