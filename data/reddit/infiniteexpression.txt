Lol. There's that American exceptionalism bullshit. STFU. Just because you were born in America does not make you better than anyone else. 
PS. Am American and I realize we are the face of hypocrisy on the biggest global scale. History books will most assuredly not make us look good. Potentially the biggest negative impact on human history. If you think otherwise you are either dilusional or ignorant.

Fuck core and bcrash. Anyone who truly understands the tech has realized that Bitcoin is great start but only a model or loose guideline. The crypto of the future that will likely become the crypto standard likely doesn't exist yet. Maybe the foundation which may evolve into it may exist but Bitcoin from the ground up is not capable of what a third + generation crypto will be capable of. I look at bitcoin as the Jesus crypto, sent by God (Satoshi) to pay for our sins and die, and from the ashes the future will rise.

What about monero thats is an community project that aims for decentralization through changing the algorithm to prevent too much collective power?

Bitcoin is an idea but also a literal physical thing, you can print out, hold and destroy it. Only the coin that Satoshi started is the real Bitcoin. I understand bch has the same history but once it forked it became a unique individual different thing.
