I really hope not, both of those were old and tired very quickly.  Although to be fair that pretty much sums up how I feel about memes in general.

I feel the same, can't help feeling like these 'stress tests' are more likely to result in miners filtering out 'spam' transactions than anything else.

I'm not sure if it's related but the andrioid app bitcoinprices hasn't shown data for bitstamp since the 6th of June.

Awesome stuff, Scan has some competition for when I get my new GPU \^_\^ (Yes I know Aria accept BTC too, but I've had serious issues in the past with them).  Although I'm kind of surprised Ebuyer don't accept BTC yet.

Not really, the user tipping still has to invoke in order to tip, isn't that advertising enough?

I understand the concern, what I don't understand is the need for so many threads to discuss the same issue it's getting incredibly tiresome.

I know it's immature, but I found this fellow's name quite amusing in this context.

I don't think they ever even dealt with physical cards, it started out life for exchanging cards for MtG Online I think.

Gox was never a mountain, MtGOX stood for Magic the Gathering Online eXchange \^\^;

I'm in favour of raising the block limit but I'm not convinced Bitcoin XT is the best way to go about it.  Honestly I find all the drama surrounding the subject a little suspicious.

Edit: in case you didn't find that funny,

It's an election very few people can vote in though.  Running an XT node isn't really casting any kind of vote since nothing happens until XT has 75% of the current hashrate.  That being the case the only people who have any say in the matter are the people who are running the mining pools.

I'm still flabbergasted about that one myself.  This place feels like it's turning more and more into V for Vendetta every day.

He is, I'm not familiar with all the details but someone posted an image of an email supposedly from Uber saying they were looking into accepting Bitcoin.  I'm guessing it turned out to be a hoax as there have since been several other faked email posts about Apple, Amazon etc for the sake of taking the piss.

I understand that, but the conversation has moved away from increasing the blocksize to XT Vs Core which I feel is quite unproductive.  There's little actual discussion happening just people who think they're absolutely correct arguing their side.

Can't wait to see the 1440p version.  I'm using the 1080p version at the moment and it still looks lovely on my 1440p screen though.  Thank you for sharing \^_\^
