Not promoting anything , just wanted to write about it and see your opinions about it which I am enjoying of course.

I don't think we should go as far as calling this a scam, this is mainly a IT students project which might develop into something better. It's just a start. I see no difference really between a coin which was given away without any mining phase and this. Time will tell and  it's too soon to judge it this way. This is a new concept and it is worth showing what it can do imo. But I respect your opinion everyone has a different way of seeing things.

When there is a system as great as this one, there is no "too many"!

Ty you for the PS i just noticed it after replying.
I understand your point but the whole idea behind it is to bring awareness about cryptocurrency to the outside world don't you agree? It is clear that there is no specific algorythm involved into mining this but just the fact of allowing it to be used as easily is pure gold for the altcoin and bitcoin world. It's all about creating awareness even if this project doesn't succeed there is a lot of people who will hear about it who never knew what Cryptocurrency is.

I agree with all your comments but this is too harsh calling this a scam yet. When coins like Dogecoin came out sponsoring a dog who though it was going to be one of the top altcoins today? Stop looking at the mining process and look at the whole concept and open doors it creates. Basically someone who doesnt know about cryptocurrency doesn't even understand how any of the algorythm mining process works. So to them there is no difference between this and the actual 200 others altcoins. One of the many reasons new altcoins are being created is to do exactly what coins like dogecoin is doing. Create awareness and this awareness will bring more people to question what is crypto but thats once again my opinion only!

Well there are multiple reasons to that, believers wanting cryptocurrencies to be known on a wider scale.  But i believe the biggest factor here is to be able to anonymously purchase your cannabis trough anonymous currencies.
People are trying to find way for altcoins to have their specific purpose, this might not always work but will eventually lead in a more elaborated system i believe. It's all part of the crypto evolution :)

I am also thinking the same, i was thinking about writing an article about the whole GAW farce. A ponzy scheme which won't last for ever unfortunately. The need to launch their own coin pretty much confirmed the lack of funds.

Not different from what governments does is it? :P

Lol the coin logo? or the mining concept? I think it could be a pretty good advertiser for the crypto world in general.
