what could be the correct time to sell?

I thought ETF will draw us down to 6k as it usually were continuosly doing when the decision was delayed. I´ve heard that this kind of news does not move any stock more than 2% maybe is the same with crypto

its in red, but BTC seems recovering just now for at least a couple of hours  more.

yes I got your point completely, but if im trying to sell low and buy high is to accumulate more satoshis over the year. and maybe do that for a living.

I bought at 8k yestarday, thinking that we were going to break that F@ 8.2k resistance, hope we do it in the next days? what do you think is it possible?
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:03:10
why? what happened? I just read it was delayed again right?
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:39:36
Let me explain
1. Disable google authenticator on security settings on bitstamp.
2. Second my phone dead.
3. My funds frozen.
4. Me in panic when I found out that my bitstamp account frozen.
5. The page in the whole process said" you must enable 2FA authentication ir oder to use your account"
6. I tried, scan the code but nothing.
7. Post on reddit
8. Me in panic again, almost a heart attack
9. Without hope tried again to enable authentication as page suggested.
10. worked
11. Withdrawl my funds just in case
12. repet step 1 and 9
13. Mmy conclussion, there must be a synchronization time between our accounts and bitstamp server that all I conclude.
What do you think?

If we are in a consolidation phase,according to the book "7 charts patterns that consistently makes money" by Ed Downs on page 30 states that consolidations is a breakout chart pattern and he assures that in this moment we are acquiring momentum to move forward in the same direction. Cause since we left 5k behind, that means we are in the bull market and that this consolidation is to keep moving to the moon. what do you think about this?

Amazing, I will adopt btc as my favorite soccer, basketball and football team!!! GO GO GO BTC!! well I also go for ETH :)
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:06:01
Do you think we have the momentum to break the 8k resistance level during May? How realistic is that we could reach 10k in june?

Wondering what is the best VPN to use while making transactions with crypto? which are your experiences? Which VPN does not store your log info -for real-? is necessary to have a MAC or IP change method to improve, will I be banned from the exchange if I cointinuously log  in from IP, MAC and DNS from different sources?
