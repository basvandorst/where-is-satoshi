Thank you for the detailed feedback and for the information about customs. I am glad you like the jerky, we put a lot of time in to perfecting the recipes and designing the packaging to go with it, so i am glad we gained a new fan.
As for the International shipping, I know this can be difficult sometimes and honestly due to the fact that we can not track it efficiently  i am always worried it will not arrive, so  i am happy yours did.   
Again thank you for the support and kind words, it's messages like this that make it all worth while, especially in as we don't always get to interact with the customers so i am happy you chose to do so.

Thank you for your vote of confidence, I appreciate the support. We are trying to be the Beef Jerky company of the future and we are big believers in cryptocurrency, hence the need to add it to our website. 
The more functional uses people have for BTC the quicker the rest of the world will adapt.
