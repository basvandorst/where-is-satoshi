I get that but that's kind of backwards, people have to move these coins around one way or the other. At some point someone has to get into bitcoin through a corporate entity. What if it happens during this process? Just throwing this statement at the problem isn't really fair honestly.

Claiming a dictorship or a cabal of dictators is at work here is also ludicrous. How exactly, is that productive thinking? You're very much understating the community's involvement and power in all this. Look at BitcoinXT it was fairly easy to adopt and be safe on both sides. Do you think that if the current group of developers did something stupid to core, the community won't notice? Do you think the option is then not there for us to just say "Uhmm... fuck that we're switching.." What exactly do you forsee the dev team doing that we cannot not stop them from enforcing?

If things were fishy, badly done, or flat out wrong for bitcoin, someone somewhere would've opposed and the community would have noticed, they don't need to be theory specialists or economic advisers. The worlds current financial system has a shit ton of those and they aren't exactly doing well. These people are a team and they collaborate about almost all of these changes.

The problem is that not merchants accepting bitcoin. The problem is convincing consumers to start using it as a currency by itself. People you introduce to bitcoin today don't have bitcoins yet, so if you tell them to buy some, they just look at you say; "Well why don't I just use the dollars instead." With mastercard implementing things like this it'll definitely make it harder to argue why bitcoin is SO much better. It'll make it sound like it's a little better which many consumers won't consider worth the trouble.

It's not BitcoinXT that's causing controversy, it's the blocksize that's causing most of this debate. "If something doesn't have full consensus it probably doesn't belong in bitcoin" is a false statement, this is assuming that all developers involved in bitcoin agree on whatever is put into bitcoin core? Nonsense. If there's enough disagreement in the community, they might as well split because one will never convince the other anyway. Why wait if we have the solution now? Also concerning what the ramifications are, mike thoroughly addressed [this.](
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:44:51
There's nothing ignorant about the statement I made, it's factual.
The 75% is a benchmark to know that the majority of the network prefers a blocksize increase. Why do you have a problem with the community deciding what gets used? Devs can take these kinds of actions at any point in time, whenever they feel like it. That's the beauty of it. We as a community then get to decide whether it's the right step or not. Whichever we choose, happens. Meaning if they set these arbitrary rules like forking at 60% or 50% will not succeed if the community doesn't agree, because such decisions will be questioned and abandoned if they can't establish evadence that it's absolutely necessary.

How is it not legit to block these trancations first hand flat out? When your creditcard is compromised and somebody makes a extra costly purchase they block the purchase as well? Maybe it's just you buying something expensive, maybe it's a thief with access to your account/creditcard. However you don't go and throw a fit saying OMAGERD!!! it's my money.

Currently I have my bank account with ING and purchase bitcoins with in on a monthly basis. From what I can deduct from the conversation, the guy is merely trying to throw a fit rather than come to an understanding on why ING is doing what they are doing. 
When I purchased bitcoin for the first time with my ING account they promptly blocked my purchase correct. However a quick call to ING and they immediately lifted the block. Fraud when it comes to bank accounts is very common, and bitcoin is an excellent way to make it hard to trace. Basically it's just a precaution, they want to know if you actually know what you're doing rather than flat out block your purchases, it's like making a purchase with you credit card that's a little most costly than usual in which case most of the time your creditcard provider/company gives you a call just in case.
Move along, no evil banks here.

A common mistake by many who are living in "normal" circumstances is they don't see just how hard it is if you're out of the norm. Recently I was in a position of having residence in one country, citizenship in another, banking in a third and occasionally on holiday in a fourth. The kinds of blockages that can be put in your way in these circumstances can be maddening. And god forbid you live in a country with capital controls, for example. None of this BS has anything to do with you personally, and yet you are forced to jump through endless hoops just to use your own money, and pay substantial fees for the privilege (and you don't have any choice but to use the banking system). Reflect on that for a moment.
The problem with *your* logic is that it's your point of view, while I politely consider both sides of the purchase. I adore the technology bitcoin has to offer, however I am not oblivious to the fact that there are some people out there who prefer using a bank account instead. What do you suggest then? that all these people just become victims of account theft when it comes to it? So they can learn the lesson you have? Regardless of all of that, none of the actions the bank took are "arbitrary" it's pretty clear cut why they do it. Nothing arbitrary about it.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:27:23
They are not "abandoning" anything. Instead they are giving the people an alternative to a problem they feel needs to be dealt with.
In this case the core dev team disagrees and so we should auto default to no blocksize increase? Unacceptable.

Again the context and translation of the conversation was poorly done. I've had the same experience in where I wanted to buy some bitcoin and ING blocked the purchase. But when I made a quick call to ING, I got a woman on the phone specializing in alternative currencies and she explained to me that they do this for the safety of the users, because fraudulent payments were being made to purchase bitcoins and then became virtually untraceable. To prevent this the woman asked a few questions to make sure I am not completely oblivious to what Bitcoin was, then told me they'll lift the block because I knew what I was doing. I don't consider it such a bad thing to protect the user from him/herself.
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:49:03
Your logic is so flawed, I've given this example a thousand times already but here goes again. Most bank accounts/creditcard accounts are packed with all kinds of precautionary functions to immediately stop purchases whenever it meets certain demands. FOR EXAMPLE.
When a malicious user gains access to your account "Your" supposed money can be spend by someone that isn't you. When he then transfers a large amount of money out of your account it's possible that the bank will flat out deny "you" (the thief.) to do so.
In this case I bet you'd be happy the bank made these "arbitrary decisions." It's not that weird for the bank to consider bitcoin in the same aspect, because it's very easy to purchase bitcoins and make them virtually untraceable after the fact. Then the bank is stuck with an individual who has large sums of money removed from his account, and no way to retrieve it. Funny thing is you'll be pissed off and blame the bank for stopping the transactions because it's "obviously suspicious."

You're obviously not trying to come to a solution with ING, i've had this exact same situation and it was cleared up simply with 1 call to ING Service line.

For example, i've made a transation on my computer to transfer all the funds from my multisig address, and somehow I need to get this unsigned transaction onto my iPhone. Since I can't use a USB stick to transfer the unsigned transaction, I tend to send the unsigned transaction via any form of messaging, be it whatsapp/skype etc, can anyone get anything out of an unsigned transaction, is this bad practice? and if it is, what would be a good way to transfer unsigned transactions properly between my computer and an iPhone. using coinb.in btw, Thanks.

None of these wallets are doing this. It's possible to do with coinb.in now obviously, but it's really a hassle to transfer transactions between systems.

This point was never debated, however the credit card information is stored encrypted, on the device. gaining access to this information gives you nothing, you'd need to have physical access to the phone in order to do anything with it.


This was pretty obvious, I mean you do have to scan in the card... how else would you even get the card on the phone, you're just saying stuff everyone knows already.


With regard to the claim that Apple doesn't store your credit card information on their servers I'm not actually sure that's the case. I don't have an iPhone but it sounds like Passbook syncs across devices which means at the very least your credit card information passes through their servers so it can be delivered to your other devices. Regardless there is no guarantee that Apple doesn't have the ability to grab information off your phone at anytime. Whatever the case it is likely that if Apple's servers were compromised your credit card information would be compromised as well.
So you see digital security is still required with Apple pay and it is less secure than Bitcoin because there are a lot more attack vectors both known and unknown. However Apple and major credit card companies insure consumers so that should a security breach occur they are not liable for the charges. Bitcoin has no insurance.
The reality is the general public's understanding of "digital security" is laughable. Any digital device that is connected to the internet is not secure. A lot more people have fully authorized access to your devices than you realize and even more could easily gain unauthorized access.
Source: Web developer for 15 years.
Maybe I should've been more specific but again the credit card information is encrypted, even if it passes through a 1000 servers, there's nothing you can do with the information. You need to have the device to make purchases. Which is inherently difficult in itself because if someone steals your device you can simply disable the entire phone remotely.
You're simply making no valid point as to why Apple pay is *less secure* then Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's core fundamental design might make it a more secure system as Apple Pay, but to the end user it's definitely not more secure it terms of getting your money stolen or not, it's at the very least just *as* secure.
Source: Irrelevant, just common sense.

I think you fail to understand the difference between being responsible for security, and not requiring security at all. With bitcoin you're responsible regardless of what happens.

I am a bit confused, and correct me if I am wrong, but as someone who has been waiting for this to be implemented with multisig, why did they choose to split up a single private key instead of just using whole private keys? You know mutlisig? 
Seems kind of reduntant to split the private key itself. The only thing that springs to mind where this can become usefull is to stop confusion between multisig addresses in different cryptocurrencies knowing that Litecoin multisig addresses also start with a 3.

It's not necessarily doing anything different, but it sure as hell is easier to use. What I meant with my post though, is that it could be made alot easier for the user, overall.
Basically what I want is a breadwallet with multisig, combined with a desktop client.
Electrum for mobile devices would also work. Just give me something that allows me to use both my computer and phone without even having to look at the private keys/public keys.
The problem now is: 
Either the provider of the service forces you to have 1 key stored with them.
Or the service does alow you to store all of the keys yourself, but then doesn't provide you with an app to sign transactions with the click of a button.
