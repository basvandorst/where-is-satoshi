They recently stated that they have not sold one coin.

No you will lose your ass with these.

It's funny, we are in a culture that we expect great customer service and if we don't get it we wig out. I am guilty myself. Add the fact that this is all somewhat new and unregulated and we panic.
About 6 out of the last 8 transactions took 4 or more hours to happen. Now I just plan on waiting a fair amount of time and I don't stress over it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:12:44
No it is not on their end. Blockchain is showing a network propagation of about 0%.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:44:26
lol, I guess in my rage I misspelled Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:09:59
In theory you could do that. The problem is that it takes such a long time for money to transfer in and out of exchanges you money loses velocity.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:16:57
No problem. We are all looking for something that will give us an edge. LTC does not sound that sexy but, you may want to play around with that. It's very likely that you will get all your money back out and for some reason it takes off, you could actually make a bunch. Through a couple 7950s together and let them go to work.

Coinbase  gets a pretty bad rap on this board. Knock on wood... every one of my transactions have gone through. Maybe not as timely as I would have hoped but they have gone though. 
They have responded to every one of my emails that I sent asking for support. 
Personally, I think they are doing decent job with what they have to work with. This volume is caught quite a few off guard. If they don't respond to your email request, then start to worry.

I am kind of hoping to see a correction in the next 3-4 hours. Crash sounds negative:)
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:22:12
It depends who you consider a vendor. There are very few advantages for retailers and one major disadvantage. Getting your money back out. I am a fan myself but, many retailers would get crushed if the market dropped.

You will find quite a few things that don't make sense when you are exploring Bitcoin. It is next to impossible to make money mining BTC right now. The boxes that are fast enough are not available at this time(for the most part) and if you want to gamble and pre-pay for a machine, you have no guarantee of when it will arrive and if you will recoup your initial investment.
Find a mining calculator that projects upcoming difficulty changes like the one on the genesis block and figure out how much hash power you need per $ to break even or go positive. Maybe that number is $5 G/hs or whatever you come up with for a number that works for you. Then try to find a machine that meets your criteria. 
That being said, mine because you want to, not to make money.
Good luck!

Well even if power if free you will not break even for quite some time. You need to take into account the rising difficulty. Base your mining off of a difficulty of 850,000,000 which is probably were we will be at Q1 of next year and see where you end up.

Is that safe? What is the order of events?
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:01:41
Happens all the time! 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:07:44
As of today the next difficulty would be. 633,608,585 It does not look like you will be able to purchase any equipment in the near future that would return your investment.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:31:17
It must suck to be you. lol
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:23:23
In this case it is not the fact that there are no confirmations, it's that the network propagation is 0%. I don't recall ever seeing that.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:06:37
Sorry, but for some reason it does not make sense to me. If I think BTC is going up, I want a buy contract? Based on the price it looks like I would want a sell contract.
Large brains are appreciated!

@_date: 2013-11-08 16:18:27
Supply and demand my friend. Plain and simple.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:55:45
Nice site!
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:12:03
The best thing you can do right now is sink everything you have into Bitcoin. Assuming it continues to $1,000 and above you look like a smart investor. If it crashes and you lose it all, then embrace your "lead not follow" persona and regale anyone that will listen with your tale of excitement, risk and intrigue in the 2013 Bitcoin frenzy.
Either way...your a winner!
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:53:49
Its actually worthless since that currency is not used but it is pretty funny.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:48:35
I hope this helps some of you!
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:38:09
High compared to what?
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:06:36
lol can someone explain what this is?
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:03:41
Let me see.... take the name of a website that was shut down by a government agency that was known for dealing in illegal activity and add 2.0 to the end if it. 
Questions to ask:
How much negative attention do I want?
Is this good for Bitcoin?
Do I really think I can rub the noses of the federal government in this and not solicit a response?
...say goodbye to 2.0
