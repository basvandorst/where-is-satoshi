No matter what someone does with his/her assets, they will always have them fully invested. If someone keeps them in USD then that is an investment in USD just as much as keeping money in a particular stock is an investment in that stock; same with cryptocurrency. Different assets have different associated risks but risk from investments into fiat should be managed just as someone should manage risk into other assets. Because of this, the "don't invest more than you're willing to lose" mentality is nonsensical because one has no other option than to invest everything into something.

Except that the opportunity cost of buying the miner is just buying bitcoin directly which would yield you the same relative return if BTC increased in price.

This is the first time I've heard of using the tonal system for Bitcoin. Is there really any traction for this or is the author deranged?

A question which may be more suited for but my understanding is that SEGWIT segregates signatures from the block hash. If signatures make up 50% of block size then SEGWIT will allow the same number of additional transactions as a 2 MB block limit, more or less. Doesn't this mean that SEGWIT isn't a permanent solution--it only pushes back the dilemma until we need another doubling of throughput?

Gold isn't backed by faith. It has genuine utility due to its physical properties of being conductive and not corroding.

Soft forks can only be imposed with the support of the consensus algorithm, i.e. miners in the case of Bitcoin. This fact will be very evident when August 1st comes. In the case of BIP148, for instance, a non-supporting miner could simply signal support for BIP148 but refuse to include any segwit transactions in any blocks, as well as reject any blocks mined by others which include segwit transactions. If at least 50% of the total hash rate does this, then BIP148 will have imposed no actual change.

Non-segwit blocks are still compatible with a segwit node, correct? If so, then a segwit node will always prefer a longer chain made of non-segwit blocks over a shorter chain which contains some segwit transactions. How would it even be possible to force the issue unless you require the first block after a certain time to contain at least one segwit transaction?
