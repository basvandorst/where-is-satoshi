If you hate it, why bother to drop by and start posting. Everybody can have a Bitcoin hate day but if you hate it in general better collect poststamps or colorfull butterflies and don't bother us.
It's something new, what can be something or nothing. We take risks in putting in our money/time/effort hoping for a better future,with all the risk that are watching over our shoulders. So we don't need trainmissers or FUD creators. You are either in or out. IMHO

Lol for the guy who planted a sticker... Never heard of a ING bitcoin ATM in Holland so i'm guessing its not real.

Looking forward to see some of your photo's, wondering how many people are going to visit this opening. And how many "new" people are going to get interested in paying with Bitcoins.

I have been to The Hague Netherlands and I used a ATM from Bitcoin Suisse that went perfect. No ID nothing.
there's a vid on youtube to see how fast that went.

Have to say this machine looks to F*cking complex, Why did they think people would want to stay so long in front of a ATM just to take, or put some money/bitcoin.
To much hassle putting your telephone number,scanning,handprint etc. I'm pro bitcoin but not in this way.

"I have been with bitcoin since the very beginning"
you name it, this is why you have it more easy then others.
You can take a price drop easy, where others bought in at 5/6/7/8/900+ $ 
But I like your optimism, we all hope it sells for 50K in a few years.

This is really what i'm looking for, but I have to know if I can put it on a cd and generate it offline.
Perhaps somebody with more knowledge then me on this point, can tell me if the generator is safe to use. (not that web owner has all the private's aswell)

I was just thinking about this, Bitcoin is still to difficult to get and to understand for a really big bunch of people.
Best option I could think of is Localbitcoins, hope you find a way to get some, and don't stop trying till you have them, if you stop now because its to difficult, you gonna regret it later, (IMO)
good luck

I think this question is only for yourself, because nobody here know's what the market is going to do. You can double the money in a short time, but also loose half of it. Can you loose that amount of money?
You would stimulate the market by buying, but be carefull with the steps you take doing it.

Can somebody tell me why the prices of the tickets are so high? We need the community to become bigger, but with these kind of prices you stop alot of interested people going to this conference, or conferences like this one.
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:20:08
At least you know where and who has them, but then again good luck getting them back.

Every time they scream BAN they hope the price drops, so they can buy in, sneaky China :D
