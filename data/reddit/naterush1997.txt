Why do you think Ethereum won't figure out PoS?

I don't think this is necessarily true or necessarily applicable to transaction throughput.
Faster block times != less security. For example, if an exchange wants to make sure there will not be a double spend when coins are sent, they can wait differing amounts of times depending on what coin is being sent. 
Furthermore, faster block times are actually better for efficient safety guarantees, as more blocks raise the probability at convergence on one chain on a more consistent time-scale.
Also, block speed does not necessarily scale the throughput of a network - one chain could have smaller blocks and faster speeds while a different network has larger blocks and slower speeds. It is, however, possible to have faster confirmation times and larger throughput with similar levels of security that exist today.

This may be a scam.
I saw this exact post about 3 days ago, and as a rule, I wouldn't trust a website offering direct Bitcoin-&gt;Paypal in India. Also, the posting of the proof is super suspicious, especially the way it's phrased.

I'm by no means an expert on the arithmetic hierarchy, but could one not argue that forcing transactions to include a witness other than gas, the user experience suffers significantly?
For example, I want to run some computation on a blockchain. If it's just gas based, it's easy for me to do so - I just need to decide, at least in some way, what I am willing to pay for. 
In the other case, where users are forced to provide a proof based witness, they have to run the computation themselves, as well as maintain their own storage of data that may be necessary for some transaction in the future.
It's very possible I am missing the point entirely, but if this is the case, then it seems like a user/developers nightmare.

I think STARKs are closer to the "User provides all intermediate states that occur during execution" (just from an inefficiency point of view) that you described in your talk than is maybe acceptable.
They are quite a bit larger than SNARKs :(

Ok, so from a developers perspective, it may be possible to abstract it away. What about from the user's point of view? 
It seems they would either have to rely on some service to perform the computation for them and give them a sufficient trace for them to submit as a witness, or they would have to run it themselves (which seems highly impractical).
That being said, again, I am probably missing something. Thanks for communicating in the comments :) It is much appreciated.

I don't think it is particularly realistic to assume that users can/will perform the computations themselves - it seems unlikely users on resource limited devices (say, in third world countries) are going to be able to run these computations themselves.
Also, this "one machine does that heavier computation and everyone else verifies" is currently being implemented on a Turing complete; check out [TrueBit]( if you are interested.

Miners can take the gold if they are willing to censor transactions.

One can make the same argument about PoW. Except PoS has the benefit of significantly fewer economies of scale. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:08:17
Short list of economies of scale that exist with PoW that do not exist with PoS:
* 1. Placing all mining equipment in a single location makes it significantly more efficient with PoW. This is not the case with PoS. 
* 2. With some PoS implementations (like [Tendermint]( the risk of stale blocks is essentially zero. This reduces centralization pressure from block propagation times. 
Essentially, if I invest 100 dollars into PoW mining, I get X payout. If I invest 10 * 100 = 1000 dollars into PoW mining, I get &gt; 10 * X payout because of these economies of scale. With PoS, this is not the case. 
Would love some feedback on this; not trying to start a fight, I genuinely want to know where you're coming from. Thanks!

I'm not saying that it is very different that what exists currently. I'm arguing that this is also the case with PoW, only more-so. 
I agree that PoW and PoS make the rich richer, but I'm arguing that PoS is much more fair about how it does so.
