What about 0% fee for people who got BTC lost, up to the value of the lost BTC? After this the fees go to normal.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:34:47
I meant fee credit. So it's still not free. But paid in advance.
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:31:22
Is there no e-mail confirmation for withdrawels or something?
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:49:55
Agreed, Bitfinex is the best exchange out there. If they can recover, I will continue trading on it.
I have to admit I'm scared at this moment.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:14:11
Winklevoss twins should buy BFX on the cheap now.
@_date: 2016-08-27 20:34:13
1. Bring in terrorists by the thousands (and have the victems finance it).
2. Ban encryption to counter terrorism.
3. ????
4. profit!
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:40:55
I guess I needed to add the /s at the end.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:01:53
Of course trusted is better than trustless.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:05:31
It's the company forcing it's users to spam the network and making them pay for it.
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:56:44
Did you even check the inflation schedule? it's insane.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:33:36
Exactly, everybody could have seen coming the amount of issues doubling overnight when adding Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:43:23
EXACT same issue im having!!
Case ID: 2728991 
I have a confirmed BTC deposit from December 6, which is still not credited to my account (shows as completed since Dec 6!, and shows pending at GDAX)
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:32:01
Cant mine it. It uses proof of violence.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:29:31
Yeah, hopefully this topic will attract some attention from a human at CB...
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:53:43
Thank you Justin! you're a hero!
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:53:41
Remember he wanted to keep ASICBOOST, which gave him a huge advantage over other miners. Segwit closed that loophole. That's why he was against it, and started Bcash.
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:53:44
Exactly right, that 289 Million profit came from crypto investors, there are no free lunches. Proof of work is very wastefull, I would love a good proof of stake system.
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:24:11
yes, please.
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:50:39
The most important aspect of bitcoin is decentralization. Segwit already compromisis this somewhat with the increased blocksize, but allows for LN with near infinite scaling.
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:22:03
That would be nice as well, still power costs would dictate where mining would centralize.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:37:42
I have to say it's a good neutral write up of the current situation!
@_date: 2017-02-04 12:35:42
I recommend listening to this conversation:
Where pretty much everyone supports Segwit (including Phil Potter from Bitfinex), Except for Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-02-04 07:20:56
(not shilling here, I just love proof of work)
Bitcoin is very distributed now. I think it might even scale better. And the cost of running the network will be much lower! Holders receiving the blockreward which they will probably hold instead of pay for electricity.
@_date: 2017-02-04 06:01:36
God, I would love to move to POS to lose those guys...
It's like they think they have the right to extract money from us.
@_date: 2017-02-04 07:12:15
We need to move to proof of stake to clip their wings.
@_date: 2017-02-04 06:59:31
PoS doesn't have that problem. And bitcoin is very distributed now. I think it might even scale better. And the cost of running the network will be much lower! Holders receiving the blockreward which they will probably hold instead of pay for electricity.
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:44:26
I've always been a supporter of PoS. But purely because it will give a higher bitcoin price. Now we might actually need PoS to save us from those insane PoW miners.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:07:42
Agreed, just take a look at this video, it will turn your stomach:
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:18:30
Also add POS please. So it's not still centralized in china.
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:46:03
Thats the True EC (emerging centralisation) spirit!
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:20:15
This is why in my view ChinaBU is anti-scaling.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:02:38
Because it isn't that much for an exchange like bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:36:29
I think the best way forward is to have 50% POS and 50% POW. Also less cost of electricity for the network.
@_date: 2017-03-28 06:34:48
Actually Proof of stake is much better.
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:27:32
Pure gold!
@_date: 2017-01-21 08:42:00
Sorry, I mean it's less expensive for us holders. Ultimately it's the bitcoin holders that pay for the energy bills.
@_date: 2017-01-21 07:47:00
Agreed, However I would like it to be part POS as well. Less waste, and less likely to centralize.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:19:21
I vote for moving to Proof of Stake, and leaving this mess behind us.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:11:47
Imo is an insane statement that such large sale had no effect on the market price.
@_date: 2016-12-13 11:21:11
I would like to have a PoS system for bitcoin as well.
PoW is money leaving the ecosystem to energy companies (economic destruction).
PoS is essentially free like you say, but of course there are incentives to "hold" as well. I feel there will be less selling pressure with a PoS system compared to a PoW system where the miner HAS to sell to pay his energy bills.
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:49:57
Segwit is already this compromise:
With 100% of transactions using segwit features this is expected to be about 2MB of data per block, however in the worst case could be up to 4MB of data per block.
@_date: 2016-12-20 11:52:03
It isn't about recording all coffee transactions on the blockchain, that's simply impossible like you say.
The BU folks seem to want bitcoin centralized and control it.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:24:55
A bit of both I believe.
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:48:25
100% agree.
The only option for bitcoin to be usefull for coffee money is Lightning network!
The purchase of a coffee doesn't need to be recorded by thousands of computers forever. It's a waste of resources.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:41:36
"Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash were sold in a manner that had no effect on market price".
This is amazing. How did they achieve this? They sold it to someone who would otherwise never have bought bitcoin? And this person promised to never sell it again?
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:52:43
I fully agree with Vitalik here.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:37:49
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:51:00
How is this productive?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:52:20
This is my concern with Ledger, how do I verify my "recieve" address the browser extension shows? The ledger device itself does not show it. u/btchip
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:32:26
Volume is not the same as buy pressure.
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:32:53
Fully agree, bitcoin holders paid for those donations.
@_date: 2017-04-18 07:40:33
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:03:24
Better make the blocksize as big as possible to avoid this attack /s.
@_date: 2017-04-03 06:26:20
LOL, this is the best simplification i've seen!
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:43:34
Does it signal Segwit?
@_date: 2017-04-29 12:59:24
Exactly, or at least a hybrid. Otherwise mining will stay centralized in China.
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:40:29
I'll be honest here, I've had sleepless nights over the BU attack.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:02:03
Not sure whether he is malicious or stupid.
@_date: 2017-04-29 12:59:57
And why is this bad? Now the money is wasted on energy.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:56:09
You should check the address on the device instead of the infected chrome browser, correct?
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:35:28
Why doesn't the Pineapple Fund donate $1M to the bitcoin hodlers by burning $1M bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:39:04
I think Socialism always ends like this. It's an evil system.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:59:54
Unintended consequences, who would have thought?
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:56:21
LOL, to the rescue, SJW!
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:39:56
It's a good debate. I like Erik, but it's a shame he supported 2X.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:18:22
I agree 100% with you.
If someone digs a hole, did he create value? what if he fills the hole again? did that create value?
PoW has a huge cost. And this cost has to be carried by the market, if we did not have this cost (not saying this is possible), the price would be much higher.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:56:29
I'm OK with greed. But Soros is pure evil.
@_date: 2016-10-23 06:32:52
Bitcoin is working awesome right now. No need to rush to fuck things up.
@_date: 2016-10-23 12:01:43
Spot on, cheap customers are the worst customers.
@_date: 2017-05-03 10:16:12
Asicboost explains that.
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:54:00
People should just shut up and pay for this party right? /s
@_date: 2016-10-23 06:27:34
Great news for centralization...
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:59:33
Then it's a different chain.
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:47:00
Please signal it, it's worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:37:13
Only Lightning networks can solve this. Instant and near free transactions...
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:01:55
Wu is the only miner that doesnt care about the bitcoin price. He cares about asicboost.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:30:00
They can be up to 8MB with segwit 2x.
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:31:15
you fucking idiot. Anyone can setup payment channels.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:02:47


The miners main goal is to extract the most wealth from bitcoin users, so that's not really aligned.
