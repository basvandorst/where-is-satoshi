This has nothing to do with BTC or crypto. It's misleading and shitslinging. Unhelpful post. Downvoted.

That is a convenient route that I would like to take. I just feel like staying with coinbase would justify their actions and set a precedence in the crypto market. I'm here to stay, I support the initiative of the entire cryptocommunity. 
This has nothing to do with finance for me. If I stay with coinbase, i debase my reasons for involving myself in the first place; to take part in a decentralized market. 
BCH goes against these principles in my view, and coinbase not only supported it, but helped it gain unwarranted credibility.

Noob here, this is accurate.
I'm so tired.

Leaving Coinbase ASAP, waiting on confirmation from Gemini. Seems like many of you got in line for that before me, though. Been waiting since yesterday to move coin. I'm ok with this though, network has to expand and catch up and stabalize. All the 1-marshmallow kids will come running back to BTC when other coins hit growing pains. Problem for them is, the price will be up by then. People selling now are losing money for no reason other than impatience. If you need that coin to live, well, I don't blame you. Maybe a few presents. If you're trading your coin for USD because "this might be your only chance," that is a very foolish action.
TLDR; now is not the time to sell, its the time to start purchasing with bitcoin. USE the currency, but do not sell it off. We gain value by starting our own BTC markets.

Watch as the walls close around us. How much power will the governments seal for themselves? Fucking nauseating.

If you're wearing a suit and drinking coffee, its investing.
If you're wearing a button-down and drinking booze, its gambling.

Oh good, now TWO companies are competing! Look how decentralized!

Dominance went up the past days because the price died. It went down over the past years because there are more desirable protocols now. 
If you're going to hodl, just hodl. 
Convincing yourself not to sell? Walk away and come back later.
BTC dominance doesn't matter to anyone except BTC hodlers. It's a poor indicator of health.

I buy altcoins because there is an ecosystem waiting to be awoken? 
We don't need a "new" bitcoin, we have one, and it works pretty well for what we are doing.

They KYC the shit out of you. I have to go digging in boxes for the correct verification because I don't have bills in my name. Just a heads up.

Hey look everybody, China is putting themselves behind by banning legit technology. What a great time for the rest of the world to catch up to them. Fiat-slaves are gonna cry the whole way down, aren't they?

Would-be day traders, ignore this fucking guy. I'm new, I'm learning, and I'm doing decent. With more work and learning I'll be even better. I lose and win. That's the point.
People who say this don't have the patience to learn the trading skill. 
Please do study though. You'll be slaughtered if you go in blind.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:52:34
This math doesn't cut it. Need more concrete to hold this together. You think it's hard for a couple million to find its way in every day? A couple million is nothing in the business game bruh.
Youre looking at it likes it nothing but investors and day traders. There is an entire ecosystem going on in there. Some of us -earn- bitcoin.

Check out gemini, I switched to them after the bcrash incident on coinbase
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:41:44
This is the future I see. There is room for many coins in this market. Different technology, different uses. I don't dry my hair with a blender.
I also don't buy generic - looking at you, bcash-me-oussiders. Fucking Megablocks.

He's right, it's bullshit. FUD as usual. Hodl on. If you have balls youll look for the bottom a bit while we are here.

I read "socks" instead of "stocks", disappointed.

Lol. Feds.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:45:08
This is not true. Monero blows, yes, but privacy chains are in full swing, like Bitcoin private and other zk snarks protocol coins. Scaled up significantly. 
You sir, are a maximalist. Ought to admit to yourself now, it'll make your arguments go faster.
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:41:23
Go back to grade school. The people in charge don't care about you.

BEAUTIFUL response. I'm busy today now but I look forward to this one. brb
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:20:16
I was thinking the same.
Nice emoji, guy. I'm sure you'll get more upvotes now.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:11:12
It's the biggest decentralized value network. It is a tiny little thing to the elite and they are having their way with your beloved coin. The more regulation and pseudo-investing we seek, the less small investors stand to make.
They are marginalizing profitability in the crypto space and people are fucking ASKING for it.
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:51:23
No. This is not the same. I'm telling you that the information is there, and that I don't have time to help you.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:15:14
This dude thinks the SEC is more than glorified gangsters. Lol.
They don't care about you or Bitcoin. They will approve it whenever it lines their pockets best.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:11:36
Solid risky advice. I like it. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:34:15
Sounds overly complicated and less secure than using a block chain.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:16:18
Lightning? Private? Huh?
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:42:09
Pay better attention. I'm not your researcher.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:18:17
This is not true.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:05:49
Nice. So you have no information to reply with? I'll continue to believe in my 'shitcoins' with an argument like that.
Not pitching, informing. I ain't sellin' you shit.
Bitcoin isn't perfect, satoshis shit did in fact stink.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:17:07
Lol, smart asses in this thread are going to eat their words. I can't wait until your regulated ponzi scheme AKA stock market burns. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:00:50
Which is fucking amazing, and I love it for what it does right, correct. But lightning network is kind of a travesty. Adoption doesn't have to mean transaction-rich. 
Can't digital gold and the soil of an ecosystem be good enough? We have to throw on modules and shit talk forks and altcoins to get our price up?
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:16:17
Ok guy, enjoy, fuck off and die. I won't be leaving though. I care too much about the space to let power hungry assholes ruin it.
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:09:59
Let the hate consume you
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:56:39
Do you think I care what someone will allow me to do?
Do you think we should hand over our hard earned value to "the people in charge?"
I can't stop ETFs from happening, but I can make a post about how it's not a good idea for us to try and push their agenda for them.
You sound like someone who gave the bully your lunch money. The SEC is just a big bully.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:48:36
They are not here to protect anyone. They are here to take advantage.
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:36:58
An insect with that attitude would be squashed fast.
Sometimes, you don't want everyone watching what you're doing. Especially when you're small.
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:32:12


I'd like to see your source on that one.


Lighting network isn't a trusted setup essentially?
I'll believe LN is a reasonable, usable scaling when I see someone wearing ugg boots use it.
Huge improvement over what exactly? Scaling? That is being done in other coins better. Privacy? Still better elsewhere.
I like BTC too, but can we stop pretending it is a useful currency?
Fast, private, cheap, BTC is not.
