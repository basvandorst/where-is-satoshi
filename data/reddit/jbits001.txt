There was also the dot.com bubble in those early days.  Many websites and ideas, that today are worth billions, were ahead of their time and crashed and burned.   It could always take that route and crash and burn.  
Humans are terrible at predicting the future, so no one can say with absolute certainty what will happen.   
People just need to follow the rule of not investing money they don't have or can't afford to spend.   
When people start taking out loans (which they have) that's a bit trublesome.  On the upside though, the value is very spread out globally, so a crash wouldn't have any huge major effects.

The original conversation was about whether drug dealing was a victimless crime and not about the morality of the drug trade and govt. interference.  
The victim is usally the customer and the negative effect is addiction, impact on quality of life or death.  
People who sell drugs are willing to take the risks for the huge return on their risk.  
If drugs were legal I'm pretty sure most of those drug dealers would look for a different endeavour, one that would give them similar returns.

I think you need to go back and re-read the conversation thread as it seems you are overly sensitive of any criticism to crypto-currencies.  You seem to be adding negative context to the whole of crypto-currencies, instead of reading them for what they are - individual criticisms.   I could further hypothesis why that could be, but I think it's best you work that out on your own.  
I would seriously hope that pointing out smart investing is not considered "trolling" on this subreddit.  This goes without saying, but that type of investing not only hurts the individual but also all the other investors.

That's all fine and good, but those that have the money to risk should be investing, not those that are gambling their rent check.

Psychology is pretty indicative off bubbles - emotion over logic.

That way all the cool people know you're into cryptocurrencies.

I said that in my comment, but went a bit further.  For Bitcoin and other currencies the question is will others see value in it, because if you are the only one that sees value in it, there is actually little value.  If you are using it as an investment tool, you need to feel confident that *others* will see value or utility in it.    As it's not tied to a companies or assets performance the valuation really comes down to if enough people see value in it to invest to raise the price, whether it's due to them thinking there is utility there (replacing fiat currencies or competing with them) or just thinking enough people will buy to invest as well.   
The economy is doing great, as is the stock market (well except for the drop due due to the Bezos/Dimon/Buffet healthcare venture and the Nunez memo today) add to the tax reform and people having extra money I would think more people are willing to make risky investments (which I don't think most people disagree that crypto is).  That will be tempered with many being put off by the crash, or what many here like to call FUD.  
Personally I'd rely more on confidence polling and analysis than any previous performance.  
As a side note a to utility, I do believe it is there for crypto as there are many countries that don't have stable fiat, it's the huge volatility that counters the benefit.  As to the US dollar, well, if that crashes so does most of the global economy.

That's a good way to ensure that Bitcoin are further regulated.  You may win your case, but then it will also open the door for the proof for the need to regulate and that the users want it.

The pros and cons of a lawless, unregulated system are the same: the lack of laws and regulation.

No one has been able to accuralty predict the movement of stock prices.  You are better off flipping a coin, or using a cat as one popular article indicated.   
If you are confident that others still see value in Bitcoin, by all means invest, but I would not bank on using a model of past performance to indicate future performance for these types of investments, especially when there are so many variables that can't be properly assessed by these models.

That is the echo chamber effect of the internet.  Once people with opposing beliefs get tired of yelling at each other they retreat to their own corners and no progress is made. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:07:53
That and open the door for the need for regulation.

Thank you.   I'm surprised this sub continously glorifies this person, who clearly has some fucked up moral values, just because he shares the same beliefs in crypto.

A better society for all, so minimal as your return is spread amongst all citizens.
