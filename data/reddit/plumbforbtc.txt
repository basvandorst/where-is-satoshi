"But coming up with an exact link between climate change and weather events is tricky. We need lots of data to show whether rare, once-in-a-millennium events like the South Carolina floods are becoming more common. And in many places, such as southern India, which experienced flooding in November and December, there are no robust climate models for the area that can analyse the flooding."

How much exactly is a "pile" of money?   You're certain that inheritances never get put to productive uses?  Isn't it within the realm of plausibility that Satoshi Nakamoto might not have invented bitcoin without his dear old granddad's money?  He might still be working two jobs to pay off his student loans... and his medical bills for his cancer treatments he had back in 98 when he didn't have health insurance.  Luckily when his grandfather died he left him a nice sum of money... along with a note that read,             "Satoshi,  do something productive with this money.  Grandpa."

 If he wasn't concerned with the block size wouldn't he have just skipped  in the White Paper (Reclaiming Disk Space).  If block size is of no consequence, then why bother with compacting old blocks. 
7. Reclaiming Disk Space
Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before
it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.
A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
edit:  I'm learning myself... so I am genuinely asking, is this evidence that Satoshi thought the block size shouldn't be unnecessarily large?

It seems completely plausible to me that every country in the world has been preparing for the end of the dollar as the world reserve currency for decades... I mean that's one of the things that your treasury / finance department ought to be doing at least.  It can't be lost on anyone that since 1971 the world reserve currency hasn't been backed by gold... wouldn't they be taking measures to prepare for the fall of the dollar, since the average age of a fiat currency is something like 27 years.

From the article:  In contrast to the threat quantum computing poses to current public-key algorithms, most current symmetric cryptographic algorithms and hash functions are considered to be relatively secure against attacks by quantum computers.[2][7] While the quantum Grover's algorithm does speed up attacks against symmetric ciphers, doubling the key size can effectively block these attacks.[8] Thus post-quantum symmetric cryptography does not need to differ significantly from current symmetric cryptography.

 Bitcoin (i.e. blockchains ) evidently have some difficulty in scaling, because the security of the blockchain is compromised by increasing the number of transactions per second.  This has been the root cause of the "civil war" within the bitcoin community for the past couple of years.  It's worth noting that in reality it's not much of a "war"  since the overwhelming majority of developers are on the "lets not get ahead of ourselves and sacrifice security" side of the debate.  Transaction fees are outrageously high right now... because the adoption rate is outpacing the developers ability to create scaling solutions that do not compromise the security of the network.  I think this will eventually be remedied by second layer technologies that they are currently working on... but it may be that there will never be a permanent scaling solution, and it will be a constant issue for developers to manage ( bitcoin's version of monetary policy ).

I agree.  But, I think interest rate cuts are directly correlated to expansion of the money supply, which will cause hyperinflation if the expansion continues without end.  I think the Fed has simply figured out a way to delay the collapse of the dollar through hyperinflation, by directing new money into assets. 
 The ship is taking on water, they turned on the pumps (low interest rates, q.e., etc..) but the pumps can only slow the sinking. Meanwhile, the members of first class are trying to figure out how to get on the lifeboats without the 2nd and 3rd class noticing.

I see what you are saying, you make a good point.  They absolutely could do far more damage far more quickly by just giving everyone free money.  But, by lowering interest rates to zero for a decade, are they not once again encouraging bad lending practices, that will inevitably lead to hyperinflated asset prices (aka.. a bubble)?   So, if the end result of these exagerrated business cylcles is more q.e. and helicopter money, then isn't it "effectively" printing money when they lower interest rates to zero in an effort to jump start a critically ill economy?

While it's true the loss of purchasing power is not as significant when you factor in wage increases over the years...  we are still losing our purchasing power to inflation.

No, it does.  It means they are a private corporation.  


They are a privately owned cabal operating with very little to no oversight... according to Greenspan - paraphrasing ' no government agency can override our decisions." 
If they are not run for profit, then why do U.S. taxpayers owe them 2.6 trillion dollars?


I'm not sure how I came to that conclusion now, but I stand corrected.


More like the governmnet is controlled by the Federal Reserve.  While still not Ideal, it's better when the governmnet has direct control over monetary policy. The last thing you want to do is hand over the power to create fiat money to a private "for profit" banking cartel that operates with virtually no oversight.  


You simply don't have your facts straight.  Granted their is a revolving door between the banks and a large portion of our government... so in large part the banking cartel and the government are one in the same. But our government gave up the control of monetary policy (that was granted to it in the constitution) in 1913 and handed it over to a private cartel of bankers.. aka The Fed.  105 years later and those slimy banking bastards have infiltrated a lot of key government positions and bought the allegiance of many politicians.  So in a way what you are saying is true (because the banks have gained control) but it's misleading and ignores how we got here, and betrays the fact that we would be better off if congress was still in control of monetary policy. I agree it would be great if bitcoin can succeed in replacing both state controlled monetary policy, and this horseshit that we currently have.  


to seperate: state from money, and private banking cartels from money.  
More importantly the latter.

The Fed learned their lesson in the 70's.  You can't just print money and release into the wild or you will drive the prices of consumer goods through the roof.  So now they direct new money (all of the q.e) into assets: stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investment assets... and everyone loves it, but it's no more sustainable than consumer price inflation.  


I do.  I also vote for people that want to abolish the Fed.  This is for another argument... but how is the wall a bad idea?  


No you didn't.  I don't really want to hear the Feds reasons for justifying their scam anyway.

Having the dollar tied to a physical commodity makes it much harder for governments to spend money they don't have.  Certainly doesn't make it impossible... but a lot harder.  
Fiat currency would be fine... as long as it wasn't controlled by a privately owned central bank with little to no oversight, and if we demanded fiscal responsibility from our elected officials.

Lol... I don't think YOU understand the basics.


How do taxpayers pay less?  The Fed buys bonds at auction, U.S. taxpayers hold the obligation to pay the bond back at interest when it expires.  


 So what... this is what were talking about, kicking the debt can down the road.  We have a 20 trillion dollar debt due to this shit.

You really are a politician... it's all just meaningless numbers to you.  You're wrong... that money is owed to the Fed. A private orginization that prints federal reserve notes out of thin air... and then loans them to the government with interest.  The point is, there is no reason the system has to work this way. They print federal reserve notes at no cost to them, loan them out at interest, and then we (taxpayers) pay the debt back.  2.6 trillion is not an insignificant tax burden... and it's very real (not just a fucking number) to the people that have to pay it off by laboring at what ever job they have.  The government can issue it's own money without a debt owed to a private banking cartel.  


I am not talking about the over all debt... I'm specifically referring to the debt owed the Federal Reserve, because it is completely unnecessary.

I disagree... I think it is completely relevant.


The difference is... the Fed buys these bonds with Federal Reserve Notes (their very own monopoly money) that they print at no cost to themselves.  It's a scam.


Whatever. They're the same banks who are shareholders of the Fed... and they are paid dividends.


Well... no one is advocating hyperinflation.  For you to suggest that the end result of congressional control of monetary policy necessarily results in hyperinflation is ignorant.  The example you used of Wiemar Germany does not provide evidence for your argument... it was a flawed wartime strategy that resulted in hyperinflation after they lost the war.  


The difference is China doesn't print Federal Reserve Notes.  The Fed buys U.S. debt with their own (monopoly) money that cost them nothing to print.  The debt owed the Fed is real... it's $2.6 trillion.  Your argument as stated is nonsensical and impossible to follow... the fact remains, if all Fed profits go to the Treasury then this debt would not exist.  It does exist and no one claims it isn't real.

I lied I'm not going to give you the last word yet.


Yes, that is increasing the money supply.  Increasing the money supply causes (is) inflation.  They are attempting to keep inflation isolated within asset classes.  As a result, instead of the prices of consumer goods skyrocketing we get skyrocketing asset prices (just look at a chart of the Dow... see what happens after 1987?)  There are interviews you can read or listen to, with current and former high ranking Fed officials in which they admit  that this is what's happening.  It's not sustainable... and probably wont end well.  


I never said I wouldn't read it... besides I have heard the Feds justifications for their creation and continued control of monetary policy before.  The whole premise put forth in the link you provided was... the Fed should have control of monetary policy because they are isolated from political influence, and political influence has a destabilizing effect on the economy.  To which I will just say... bullshit.  The Fed is not isolated from political influence.  


You don't think anyone is qualified to separate the facts from lies?  I think that you are incredibly mistaken if you believe that.  From the link I posted... the GAO is prohibited by law from auditing these 4 areas of FED activity.  It shouldn't be too hard to find and read this law. 
"About Audit the Fed
Currently the GAO is prohibited by law from auditing four areas of the Federal Reserve:
Transactions for or with a foreign central bank, government of a foreign country, or no private international financing organization;
Deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters, including discount window operations, reserves of member banks, securities credit, interest on deposits, and open market operations;
Transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or
A part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the Board and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to clauses (1)–(3) of this subsection."

This is simply not true... the Fed pays dividends to it's shareholders (the constituent member banks).  The debt repayment will go to these banks as well... we are paying banks to lend us money that they have created out of nothing.  That's a scam... if it's not a scam, then what the hell is?  


This perfectly summarizes the monetary policy of the Fed for the last 30 years. 


It's a ridiculously stupid arrangement,  that increases the debt burden on taxpayers for no reason.  It proves that our government is corrupt and or incredibly ignorant.  Congress should repeal the Federal Reserve Act... and put the power to control monetary policy in the hands of a public body that can be audited and is subject to oversight...i.e their policies could be over-ruled (checks and balances).  The government shouldn't have to borrow money during peacetime... but that is another argument.

The histories of reserve currencies are well documented... e.g. we are not using the British pound anymore, they have an average lifespan of (i forget the number) 40- 80 years.  
All Fiat currencies throughout history have failed... So it's highly likely that the dollar will:  cease to be the world reserve currency, and eventually fail completely.

If it was one of our intelligence agencies... it seems far more likely that it would have been the NSA.  The NSA are the code breakers and code makers and were aware that crypto-currencies were on the tech horizon since at least 1996, when this paper was written, "HOW TO MAKE A MINT: THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC CASH"
We know one thing for sure... they didn't destroy in it's early days, which I think they could have done rather easily with the amount of computing power they have at their disposal.  Also seems unlikely to me that they (the NSA) or (a group within the NSA) if they didn't create it (or play a role in it's creation) were not aware of it on day one when Satoshi published the white paper... being it's their job to be aware of things like this and this particular technology was one they were most likely looking for.  
So why would they create it or at least not eliminate it?  What if they understood that the dollar's days as reserve currency are numbered and the current financial system is unsustainable.  And... that without a good replacement ready to go, the world could easily experience a long economic depression and / or warfare.

I'm not going to go back into this ridiculously long thread to find what I wrote verbatim... but you are either being disingenuinous or reading too much into lazy prose.  I assure you I was aware a doctorate and Ph.d. were the same thing.  I think Einstein was awarded an honorary doctorate of sorts... not to say he didn't earn one, but I don't think he had to jump through the normal hoops.  Regardless, in between the period of time that he recieved his 4 year degree and his Ph.d... he published his special theory of relativity.  It was this work before his Ph.d. that put him on the map in the scientific community.

Yes, I normally use Liberpedia.
There is very little information that I have found today on his education between 1900-01 to 1905 when he received his Ph.D. I'm genuinely curious now as to whether he received an honary degree or at least was allowed to bypass the normal criteria... since afterall, he had just made a major contribution to science with his theory of special relativity in 1905.
O.k. so you have a list of appox. 600 or so people. Do you honestly think I can't come up with 600 people who have made major contributions to society with a bachelors level education and lower?
Also, couldn't help noticing a couple things right from the get go... Bob Dylan won the prize in Literature in 2016... he dropped out of the University of Michigan in his first year. So that validates my argument not yours. I wonder how many more I could find.

You haven't given me a counter example.  My examples are legit by the criteria you created.  (to be taken seriously as a published researcher.... usually a doctorate, sometimes a masters, but rarely a bachelors).  Edison had no college education whatsoever... and Tesla was not awarded a degree... correct me if I'm wrong. 
You know my point is correct.  Most of the modern world would not exist if not for the contributions of non college educated to bachelor level educated people. I'm not trying to marginalize or downplay the contributions that have come from post graduate level academics.

I knew there was no proof to be had in the game either... and I could have kept going, just what's the fucking point.  It seems like if a guy happened to be a mathematician (which I certainly am not)... it would be possible to present a mathematical proof that without the wheel the modern world would not exist.  We know that to be true, (hence the common sense argument), but how do you express that in actual mathematical terms?  


I don't disagree with you.  But you know as well as I do that good content / contributions to society can come from those not submitting scientific papers for peer review. In the case of the videos I uploaded... he is simply bringing to light evidence to support a case (like a lawyer would), and one of his pieces of evidence is a peer reviewed scientific paper. Hopefully you would also agree that scientists are not incorruptible.  That being the case I believe to be true... I do think therefore that it is beneficial to humanity for outsiders to challenge scientific norms.  Particularly in economics (which is a social science to begin with) because it's not hard to see how grant money (public and private) would flow to schools supporting the system the corrupt are utilizing for their gain.

This article was written by a complete fucking moron... or a shill for the banking industry.  




        of never even being able to keep up with inflation! 
* The price of an oz. of gold in 1913 was 20.67.   
* $20.67 in 1913 had the purchasing power of $520.59 today (even using the governments official numbers)... source:    
* The price of an oz. gold today is $1279... so beating inflation by almost 2.5 times.

They learned after creating inflation in consumer goods in the 1970's that it really pissed people off... so they figured out how to direct inflation into assets: (real estate, stocks, etc.).

I don't disagree.  I was just saying that when we hear people predict the price of bitcoin  (in say 2030), they know and we know that the fiat dollar may not exist anymore... so the dollar is just being used as familiar gauge of purchasing power.

Just my two cents since you asked. 
"Another argument against mainstream bitcoin adoption he made was the fact that the US gov't could declare bitcoin an anti-american currency and pressure big companies to stop accepting/trading with bitcoin."
1. First they would have to reclassify it as a currency.  Currently treated as a commodity.  Oil, wheat, livestock, precious metals are all owned and traded by countries that the U.S. government might consider hostile.  Nonetheless we are free to own and trade these things as well. 
"The first point I was stuck on was the argument that banks will lobby congress to move to close exchanges because it undermines the USD."
2. The power and influence that banks have over the entire government at large is significant to say the least.  The fact that no legislation has been passed yet, and the mainstream media seems to be less and less hostile towards it... makes me think that they have seen the writing on the wall and know that they have to try to find a way to profit in the new emerging financial system or else become extinct.

"A small number of people—more than ten, fewer than twenty—made a straightforward bet against the entire multi-trillion-dollar subprime mortgage market, and, by extension, the global financial system. In and of itself it was a remarkable fact: The catastrophe was foreseeable, yet only a handful noticed."
— Michael Lewis, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine
A small number of people- more than ten, fewer than twenty = Kyle Bass?  Yes, he was one of those people, but it's a little bit of a stretch to claim he was one of the characters of the (movie or book).

You got me completely wrong buddy.  I'm as anti- Keynesian as they come.  If you re-read what it was I wrote, you should be able to see that what I was saying is (to paraphrase myself)... 'why pay for your car repair with your good money (bitcoin) (could be gold or silver too for that matter), when you can use your trash money (aka.. fiat).  Unless your rebuying your bitcoin immediately (so the transaction therefore would just be an attempt to spread awareness). '

You might also notice that the countries we invade all have one particular thing in common... they are not (or are attempting to not) participate in the western monetary system.  Sadaam Hussein and Quadifi were both either accepting (or planning to accept) gold as payment for oil.  We enjoy our top-dog standard of living here in the U.S. in large part due to the fact that the dollar is the world reserve currency... and it's still the world reserve currency primarily due to it's "petro-dollar" status.  The petro-dollar wouldn't exist without an agreement made with Saudi-Arabia in the early 70's, which explains a great deal as to why the U.S. continually panders to the human rights violating/ oppressive Saudi regimes... while at the same time "spreading democracy" far and wide through the middle-east.

Incorrect... from wikipedia:  "In 1971, President Richard Nixon unilaterally ordered the cancellation of the direct convertibility of the United States dollar to gold. This act was known as the Nixon Shock.
U.S. dollar value vs. gold value[edit]
The sudden jump in the price of gold after the demise of the Bretton Woods accords was a result of the significant prior debasement of the US dollar due to excessive inflation of the monetary supply via central bank (Federal Reserve) coordinated fractional reserve banking under the Bretton Woods partial gold standard. In the absence of an international mechanism tying the dollar to gold via fixed exchange rates, the dollar became a pure fiat currency and as such fell to its free market exchange price versus gold. Consequently, the price of gold rose from $35 per troy ounce (1.125 $/g) in 1969 to almost $500 (29 $/g) in 1980.

I've come to the conclusion (opinion) after years of unscientifically analyzing the geo-political circus we all live in, that there are two primary considerations at work motivating nation's foreign policy positions currently. 
 
 1. Oil is a finite resource, and supplies are running out.
 2. The dollar will not serve as the world reserve currency forever, and time is approaching for a reset. 
Major implications from both. Perhaps the Chinese are just practicing on Bitcoin for the (inevitable?) attack on NATO-COIN.

“The underpinning of currency, like the financial system itself, is trust,” Harker said in his speech, one in a series at the school on technology, business and government. “A fiat currency like that in the United States, which is issued by a central bank in a secure and stable economy, works because we trust it.
“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and money system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.

Yes but the currencies in question don't lose 90%+/year of their value like Bitcoin has. That's a bad investment.
I never questioned you were referring to bitcoin. It was pretty obvious you were referring to bitcoin... because you actually referred to it by name. Let me remind you where this whole conversation started. It started because I took exception to your original (un-edited) comment that did not include the (in the last year) part.  Because obviously lots of current fiat currencies (including the dollar)  HAVE lost 90%+ of their purchasing power unless you add the caveat (in the last year).

I said that real conservatives were being labeled isolationists by globalists... I also drew a distinction between real conservatives and neo-conservatives.  Implying that neo-conservatives were globalists. 


Again, I drew a distinction between (neo-conservative war mongering globalists, and there neo-liberal globalist comrades) and traditional conservatives that have been labeled "isolationists" "far right" "racists" "white nationalists" ...etc. 


Was my language really that imprecise or did you just not read the words carefully enough?  Modern conservatism is currently divided between neo-conservatives and traditional conservatives.  Don't forget that a lot of those labeled as "far right" are members of the Libertarian Party (there's one of those third parties you couldn't think of.)  Now remember that there is a strong ideological association between Libertarians and Austrian Economics, and that one of the main ideological components of Austrian Economics is the belief that the meddling done by central planners (i.e. central banks, politicians) is inherently destructive to the economy.

What is the fifth term (hint it's in brackets) on the third line of my original comment?  


Two examples: Patrick Buchanan (Republican), Ron Paul (Libertarian).
    In 1999 Patrick Buchanan wrote the book, "A Republic Not An Empire... Reclaiming America's Destiny".  The excerpt on the back cover reads..."Present U.S. foreign policy, which commits America to go to war for scores of nations in regions where we have never fought before, is unsustainable.  As we pile commintment upon commitment in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf, American power continues to contract- a sure formula for foreign policy disaster. 
  "The day is coming when America's global hegemony is going to be challenged, and our leaders will discover they lack the resources to make good on all the war gaurantees they have handed out so frivously; and the American people, awakended to what it is their statesmen have committed them to do, will declare themselves unwilling to pay the price of empire."
   "A day of reckoning is approaching. It is my hope that the price in blood, treasure, and humiliation America will eventually be forced to pay for the hubris, arrogance, and folly of our reigning foreign policy elites is not, God forbid, war, defeat, and the diminution of this Republic- the fate of every other great nation or empire that set out on this same course."
As for Ron Paul... you can read all about his beliefs on foreign policy at:    
You're: George H.W. Bush's, George W. Bush's, Dick Cheney's, Donald Rumsfeld's, Mitt Romney's, Jeb Bush's... etc. are neo-conservative (RHINO - Republican in name only) pieces of shit.

All I am saying is that you can't lower interest rates to zero, print trillions of dollars and not create inflation.  Central banks don't print trillions and hand out it to everybody because it would cause consumer goods prices to rise.  Instead they print trillions and buy stocks, and bonds etc.  and drive the prices of whatever assets they purchase way up.  No one complains, but these valuations are artificial, and will collapse back to reality and some time in the future.

Banks and other corporations (to a lesser degree) have far more power and influence inside the government than they should.  How and why?  Because, we have sat complacently and allowed it to become far too easy to buy power and influence in Washington (and in other governments around the world).  There is a revolving door between Washington and the big banks... money flowing in and corruption flowing out.  On paper of course, everything is fine... no where is it written in the law that banks own a controlling interest in the U.S. government, but do you think the wishes of ordinary citizens  are taken into consideration when they're drafting new banking regulations (or when removing existing regulations)?

"The best thing is to avoid the bubble in the first place, of course."
They don't seem to be doing a very good job of that... quite the opposite in fact.  The Great Depression was the longest and most severe recession in U.S. history... and it wouldn't have happened without Fed intervention.  They've just been swapping one bubble for the next in recent years:  tech stocks crash so they pump up the housing market... housing market crashes so they pump up the stock market and the bond market.  It will be a painful pill to swallow... but I think we need to get out of the business of centrally planning the global economy.  We probably do need some regulations in a free market, but we've given the Fed way too much power.  The Fed is a small private group of bankers / economists... if however monetary policy was determined by a decentralized, open source project that anyone could contribute to, I think it would work far better.

A bitcoin backed currency?  What would be the point?
The gold standard becomes impractical... due to the physical properties of gold.  If the modern global economy was entirely backed by gold... gold would cost (i've heard figures as high as $50,000 / oz) .  This would make payment in physical gold for something like a soda very difficult... who wants to weigh out gold dust in the checkout line.  
So why not use a paper currency backed by gold... or a credit card , because now you are relying on a trusted third party who have historically proven themselves to be anything but trustworthy as the stewards of gold backed currency.
Enter bitcoin, a digital gold standard... no longer is it impractical to pay for a soda or a pack of chewing gum (thanks lightning network!)... so where does the problem arise?  Why as demand for bitcoin increases , doesn't a simple code upgrade adding a couple decimal places meet this demand requirement.  I understand that there would be more incentive to hold it versus an inflationary currency, but isn't that just another way of saying that it would incentivise better ( at least more thoughtful ) investments.  The idea of people being incentivised to save vs. spend themselves into debt slavery, and the economy at large growing at a sustainable rate... seems like a good idea to me.

You're a complete stranger on the internet.  I have no idea what you "intended".  I can only interpret what you are trying to say by what you have written.  What you wrote (pre-edit) was false. 
If you can quote me or even paraphrase me where I said, "bitcoin is a good investment"... I will send you $100 in bitcoin.  
" The price is plummeting and continues to fall. It's fallen 50%+ in less than a month. That's not a good investment."   Well it certainly hasn't been a good investment yet if you bought in higher than it is now.  But, what don't you understand about the history of the bitcon price?  We have seen these speculative bubbles several times in the past.  So was it a bad investment when it crashed from the previous all time high ($1100) down to ($150)... there were plenty of people that thought so.

The federal funds rate fell from 6.5 % down to less than 1% after the tech bubble burst.  1%  not quite 0% but still quite low enough to encourage people to borrow.  It wasn't just easy lending standards... If interest rates had been higher there would have been a lot less borrowing.

Most of us don't trust the Government...    


First of all... the government doesn't control the money supply.  The Federal Reserve does, and they are not a government agency.  It is a privately owned entity with private shareholders.  The identity of the shareholders and their controlling interest is not disclosed.  And... the Fed has only been in control of monetary policy since 1913, and society functioned just fine without them.  
Lewis v. United States, 680 F.2d 1239 (1982)
275 U.S. 415 - United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation v. Western Union ...(ruling by the Supreme court in 1928 that stated... "Instrumentalities like the national banks or the federal reserve banks, in which there are private interests, are not departments of the government. They are private corporations in which the government has an interest." )


I don't know where to begin.  We have less representation per citizen now than we did in 1789.  Google... Gilen and Page's research, or watch this video.. it explains Gilen and Page's research and provides ample evidence that your faith in government is misplaced.

It would probably be fine... but there exists the possibility that the wallet generator you used was compromised with a backdoor, which would enable a hacker to steal your bitcoin after you use the private key to make a transaction.  From what I understand it's a very sophisticated attack, and I don't think it's actually been carried out yet.  I'm not an expert, so don't quote me on that, it's just what I remember  reading from a post a year or so ago.

Yeah... that idea has worked really well in America.  Generations of inner city minorities on welfare... most probably not even looking for work, because the government gives them just enough to keep them happy, i.e. (housing, A/C, food stamps).  
When poverty is the problem... jobs are the solution.  If you want more jobs,  you have to incentivise job creation... a great way to do that is through tax breaks to the people who create jobs.  Starting a corporation or expanding a business to employ more people is a financially risky undertaking.
When A.I. comes along and starts putting groves of people permanently out of work... we had better find some kind of job for them or humanity is going to go down hill fast.  
Jobs give people pride... welfare takes it away.

I think you're the one who needs some help reading... you're claiming in the comments above that one of the biggest bitcoin holders is the U.S. governmnet.  As a source you provided this link...
and in this article we find this brief write up on the U.S. governments involvement with bitcoin..


Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that Bitcoin, a software-based currency that’s supposed to be free of traditional currency restrictions, has already provided a lucrative payout for the federal government. As noted above, the FBI seized 144,000 Bitcoins while shutting down the Silk Road marketplace in 2013, which back then made it the owner of the biggest Bitcoin wallet (though not necessarily the entity with the most Bitcoins, as they can be spread across many wallets). The government then auctioned off the Bitcoins. collecting $48 million. It could’ve made a lot more money if it had waited on the sale, but Uncle Sam is still trying to get a piece of the Bitcoin action. The IRS has declared that digital currencies are taxable property, and is waging a legal battle to unmask Bitcoin users who haven’t been properly disclosing their capital gains and losses. Reports suggest that the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions go under the radar. That could mean potentially millions more for the feds to take as their own.
So... lets see if your source backs your assertions or if you are just full of shit.


The big payout was in dollars, becuase they auctioned off the bitcoins


again... 


They sold them.


if they collect on unreported capital gains... the payment will be in dollars.  
So... you're either full of shit or can't read very well.  The U.S. government is not holding any bitcoins... every time they have gotten their hands on some they have promptly auctioned them away.  The IRS will demand payment in dollars for unreported capital gains... not bitcoin.

"Federal prosecutions of white-collar crime are now at a twenty-year low.  In the summer of 2012, a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate released a report so brimming with international intrigue that it read like an airport paperback. Senate investigators had spent a year looking into the London-based banking group HSBC, and discovered that it was awash in skulduggery. According to the three-hundred-and-thirty-four-page report, the bank had laundered billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartels, and violated sanctions by covertly doing business with pariah states. HSBC had helped a Saudi bank with links to Al Qaeda transfer money into the United States. Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, which is responsible for tens of thousands of murders, deposited so much drug money in the bank that the cartel designed special cash boxes to fit HSBC’s teller windows. On a law-enforcement wiretap, one drug lord extolled the bank as “the place to launder money.” -  From "The New Yorker"

The history of the Feds creation is about as shady as it gets.  Don't forget what Wilson said toward the end of his final term in office...""I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men." -Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence

The mining topic is admittedly beyond my paygrade... I am just a layman speculating.  
It seems likely to me however that by the time there are no more bitcoins to be mined (meaning bitcoin is still around at that point... implying that it has a tremendous market cap and is widely used world wide ) that transacation costs will provide adequate income for miners, and if not then bitcoin developers will have figured out a way (whether through a proof of work change, or through other wonders of computer science) to incentivize mining without compromising the security of the network.  
I have more faith in bitcoin's design and inherent game theory protecting the integrity of the bitcoin network, than I do the central banks and their monetary policies protecting the integrity of fiat currencies.

I'm not arguing about semantics... from investopedia again:
Employee-owned corporations are companies with majority holdings by their own employees. As such, these organizers are like cooperatives, except that the company's capital is not equally distributed. Many of these companies only provide voting rights to particular shareholders. Senior employees may also be given the benefit of getting more shares compared to new employees.
An "Employee Stock Ownership Program" does not necessarilly qualify as an employee owned company... unless the majority of stock holdings are owned by employees.  
Again, I'm not knocking it.  I have always thought that profit sharing in whatever form was a smart way of doing business.  But... how many companies (not small companies) are actually owned by employees?

 From bitcoin wiki: "A powerful miner is able to execute some serious attacks, but because full nodes rely on miners only for a few things, miners could not completely change or destroy Bitcoin."
This is why the blocksize debate was so contentious... in order to keep the power of miners in check, it's important to keep the cost of running a full node low.  If when the block reward is gone... bitcoin transactions alone are not enough to sustain miners with millions of dollars worth of mining equipment sitting around, and this led to miners attempting to create more bitcoins to remain profitable, nodes could force a change to the proof of work algorithim making the malicious miners equipment obsolete.  (I think that's how it works anyway).  It's been suggested by some developers that this needs to be done now due to mining centralization.

From Investopedia: 
"What is an 'Employee Stock Ownership Plan - ESOP'
An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a qualified defined-contribution employee benefit (ERISA) plan designed to invest primarily in the stock of the sponsoring employer. ESOPs are "qualified" in the sense that the ESOP's sponsoring company, the selling shareholder and participants receive various tax benefits. ESOPs are often used as a corporate finance strategy and are also used to align the interests of a company's employees with those of the company's shareholders.


it's an employee benefit... who are the employers


again... it is an employee benefit


who is the employer? by definition... not the employees


ahhh.... found the employer

During this early speculative phase... people are going to do a lot of holding. When bitcoin becomes a household item, and everybody uses it, then the massive price gains will come to an end.  At that point... why would wealthy bitcoin holders continue to horde it?

"The logic to not giving in to terrorists, even when that could result in the deaths of hostages, was spelled out in a 2012 speech by David S. Cohen, who is now the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Finance Intelligence:
'Ransom payments lead to future kidnappings, and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments. And it all builds the capacity of terrorist organizations to conduct attacks. We must find a way to break the cycle. Refusing to pay ransoms or to make other concessions to terrorists is, clearly, the surest way to break the cycle, because if kidnappers consistently fail to get what they want, they will have a strong incentive to stop taking hostages in the first place.'"

You site one number and now your the arbiter of truth?  Does that one number with zero context somehow lend your argument a superior level of credibility?  
 I don't have time to go state by state and examine their respective: GDP, budgets, federal tax dollars received (and importantly.. where the money goes) right now... though this conversation is going to prompt me to do so later when I have more time.  Further.. there are two distinct bands of red states in this country.  You have the deep south band... of which I will admit I know very little about their economic circumstances.  And, we have the bread basket band (right in the middle of the country)... of which I am quite familiar with.  There is very little welfare here... so I would imagine that most federal dollars are in the form of farm subsidies or highway funds / infrastrucure (which all states recieve).  Blue staters would probably not literally starve to death all of a sudden if the Red states were capable of cutting off their food... but have fun buying a loaf of bread for $30 and tell me how that $80 /lb. beef tastes when you wash it down with a tasty glass of milk you purchased for $40.  (Full disclosure... yes, I just pulled those numbers out of my ass).

Edward George ( Governor Bank of England: 1993 to 2003)
"We looked into the abyss if the gold price rose further. A further rise would have taken down one or several trading houses, which might have taken down all the rest in their wake. Therefore at any price, at any cost, the central banks had to quell the gold price, manage it. It was very difficult to get the gold price under control but we have now succeeded. The US Fed was very active in getting the gold price down. So was the U.K."

Red states like Pennsyvannia? New Hampshire? Kansas?  All alligned with the Union.
Not really wanting to defend the Confederate States of America, but I will defend a more accurate depiction of history.  The south entered the war at a great disadvantage and still almost won.  They were greatly outnumbered and out gunned... and the norths manufacturing was far superior.  Yet had Stonewall Jackson not been accidentally shot by his own men, Washington D.C. may very well have been burned to the ground... seriously altering the remaining course of the war.  
But seriously... the whole country lost that war.  North and South both paid dearly.  It turns out the North needs the South, the south needs the North.  The Red states need the Blue states and vice versa.  That's why we created this country.  I just get really tired of hearing how stupid and backward we are out here. 
 I read "What's the matter with Kansas".  The author made a lot of good valid points... but I felt like he left out half the story.  The other half is... "what's the matter with the rest of the country?".   The way I see it... corporations, banks, and government are all essentially the same entity now.  So, politicians on the right work on peoples fear of Orwellian government and convince them to vote for the right if they don't want to live under tyrannical rule.  Politicians on the left work on people's fear of big corporations and billionaires with too much influence in Washington... so vote democrat unless you want to live under tyrannical rule.  Both are completely valid concerncs, but unfortunately we don't unite across party lines to do anything about it.  So we elect a Republican... the 2nd amendment is safe a little while longer, but banking regulations are relaxed and big corps get a big tax break.  Then, we elect a Democrat... and the size and power of the federal government expands.  So in the end since (imo) the banks, corporations, and the goverment are a complex (as Eisenhower suggested)... we're all losing all the time regardless of who we vote for.  And this will remain true until we can all see the elephant in the room and unite to do something about it.

Those tax dollars wouldn't be here unless the nation's agriculture was a matter of national security (namely the security of the highly populated, non food producing, coastal regions... aka the Blue states)  Red states would survive just fine without the Blue states money... if we weren't selling wheat and beef to the Blue states we would be selling it somewhere else (it's a big world).

“The study of money, above all other fields in economics, is one in which complexity is used to disguise truth or to evade truth, not to reveal it. The process by which banks create money is so simple the mind is repelled. With something so important, a deeper mystery seems only decent.” John Kenneth Galbraith (1908- ), former professor of economics at Harvard, writing in ‘Money: Whence it came, where it went’ (1975).
“I am afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can and do create money. And they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hand the destiny of the people.” Reginald McKenna, as Chairman of the Midland Bank, addressing stockholders in 1924.

Flip a coin... if it lands heads add the value of the second dice to the first, if tails then subtract. Check the wind direction.
