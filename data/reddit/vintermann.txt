No, you wouldn't. When I pay with Paypal, I have to sign up with Paypal or at the very least give them my credit card number. Whereas my bitcoins work just as well whether it's bitpay or any other service, or no service at all on the other end.
It's because of its users, not its merchants, that Paypal has a monopoly (no, not on payment, but on payment with Paypal, which is bad enough). But Bitpay or similar services just don't exist on the user end, so we as users won't end up as Bitpay's lock-in mechanism.

But I don't think that's entirely correct. For one, the sale could entice people to put more dollars into the exchange. But more importantly, there may be an attempt at legalistic sneakiness here. If Karpeles used USD entrusted to him to pay his own debts, that's undeniably criminal. But maybe Karpeles thought bitcoin was enough of a legal gray area that stealing those would be safer. 
A hare-brained idea, but even in this thread there are people trying to argue that it's legal to steal bitcoin.

What the blockchain needs to be secured against is other miners. So it ultimately makes little difference whether you can mine with CPUs only or ASICs or anything in between. What matters is that lots and lots of different people/groups are mining. And yeah, the altcoins are much weaker there, despite the centralization tendencies of bitcoin mining.

No, of course not. They'd get a worse return on investment on that than they would by just forcing depositors to withdraw.
The goal is, as i\_can\_get\_you\_a\_toe says, to get them to loan out everything they can. But they were already doing that when interest rates are as low as they were. All this does, is make it a good deal to _kick out savers_ (or just pass on the negative interest rate to them. Achieving the same thing, probably.)

You know how risky it is to buy even BTC mining equipment? Price drops, you're screwed. Difficulty rises faster than expected, you're screwed. Get a late delivery, you're screwed. When targeting one specific altcoin, these risks are magnified. People would rather have the option to switch horses - especially when the specialized devices only give you a little more bang for your buck (bitcoin ASICs by all account gives orders of magnitude more increase over GPUs, than prototype Scrypt miners do.
No, most altcoins with non-SHA hashing will never be worth specialized mining farms.

There's a quick and dirty text analysis technique that I've wanted to try, but haven't got around to: appending two files, and compressing. The more it compresses, the more similar they are.

The point of the IEEE floating point standards is to give predictable answers regardless of compiler or processor (or for that matter if you go through the calculation by hand!). But it's true that with compilers doing surprising reorderings and processors operating with internal precision, you can get the wrong answers over the course of multiple computations. 
At the very least, your compiler should have flags to enforce compliance with the standard if it pretends to implement the standard at all.

It's very simple. Go to BTC-E, since they have a nice interface (not because you can necessarily trust them). Right now the price is $464,6 per BTC, but how much can you buy at that price? To see that, scroll down to the "sell orders" frame. There you'll see you can in fact only buy 0.02 BTC at this price. You want more right now, you have to go up to 464.607, then you can buy 3 more BTC. And so on and so on... The more you buy, the less are available for sale at that price.
Right now there are about 6000 BTC for sale at BTC-E. But you can bet a lot of those are people who just optimistically set a sell order for $1200, or $200000 or what have you. See how being determined to buy all the [anything] in the world can bankrupt you very quickly?

Of course, but not always cost efficiently, and that's what we care about. Generic hardware is sometimes more cost effective than specialized hardware, for more or less the same reason off the shelf software is often the right choice over custom-written software.
With GPUs, you basically get the help of gaming nerds to finance the development of the hardware you use. For CPUs, you get the help of everyone. For a specialised device, you only get to share costs with the people doing exactly the same as you.
Even Litecoin, with its deliberately wimpy scrypt parameters in order to make GPU mining still worthwhile, does not face serious competition from ASICs. They exist, but they are a dubious investment compared to GPUs, even if all you use it for is mining. The only reason it's worthwhile for bitcoin is that SHA256 was designed to have lightning-quick specialized  hardware implementations, and they already existed for other purposes.

Also, just how damn specialized will those boxes be? Can they be used for anything other than mining? Will they be worthless with a small parameter change?

I am not aware of a single case where a nation has tried to fund a war by printing money (devaluation). Devaluation lets a state effectively default on its debts (debts denominated in their own currency, that is, including to their own citizens), but it doesn't give them the kind of resources needed for arming up.
What nations do is issue treasuries, i.e. borrowing money from its own wealthier citizens (or other nations who want to join in on the fun). Wealthy citizens are perfectly happy to treat these debt obligations as "as good as money", and charge government only a very low interest rate. That, and tax citizens, of course. But treasuries are popular while taxes are unpopular, so war bonds it usually is.

You make it sound so simple. False feedback and false reviews is a huge problem on conventional sites. It's not easy to do right, especially not when you don't have a trusted intermediary like Silk Road.

I basically agree that BTC is not a threat to government or the economy, but there is one way it is: This speculative bubble is going to really mess things up.
Even if people insist it isn't a bubble. Even if you think you'll keep this wealth forever - don't you see what a huge transfer of wealth it represents? For basically doing nothing, except getting in early. Some people will lose out - personally I think it's the people buying to hold around now - but regardless of that, the newfound wealth claims of bitcoin millionaires were previously held by someone else.

Well, FBI agents got to live too, and there's this nifty little thing called asset seizure. /jk

The agent in the criminal complaint states outright that there's nothing illegal about using bitcoin, and nothing illegal about using Tor. People who expect bitcoin to be banned overestimate its subversive impact.

It seems clear from the criminal complaint that they're charging him for money laundering for running a tumbler alone. It really doesn't buy you much, unless your coins are extremely dirty (dirty enough that the crime they're connected to is far more serious than money laundering, e.g. murder).
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:18:33
Well yes, I'd warn people about "investing" (really speculating) in government-issued currency too. In general buying something with low utility value just because you expect its price to rise, is very risky. Doesn't matter if it's yen, antiques or bitcoin.
Looking at the total amount of bitcoin in circulation times its current price, and comparing it with what can be purchased for bitcoin, you can only come to one conclusion: It's grossly overinflated. Once the thrill and excitement of being millionaires on paper dies down, and you want to get some of the actual trappings of (dollar) millionaires like fine houses and cars, you're going to find out there's not enough to go around.

The real news is that the blackmail was viable. The blackmailer threatened to expose users' information. DPR didn't just laugh it off and say "Go ahead, I know you're bluffing because that information was not on the server to be stolen", instead he gave away a lot of money.
Makes me wonder if friendlychemist wasn't the only one eyeing blackmail opportunities.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:28:18
They did get a copy of the servers well in advance of the arrest, as I understand. If they could get a copy through international legal cooperation, they could probably intervene as well - but without turning DPR, it would probably have been difficult.
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:33:52


Not so. You can remove the dirt of previous transfers (with considerable effort), but you can't remove the fresh dirt that came from the mixing operation itself.
Presently there's no need to worry much about this. Governments _want_ dirty currency to return to the legal economy, so they regularly see the other way even for conventional currency. But when essentially all coin is dirty (as is the case with bitcoin), there will be a _long_ period where they don't care where it originally came from as long as it went through a registered address as the last step.
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:00:57
In the long term, anything is possible. That is why you discount the long term (not as in ignore, as in discounting inventory)
In the near term, bitcoin's utility has taken a hit.


I don't think there's a reason to take this discussion again. Suffice to say inflation isn't always what you should worry about, printing money isn't the only way inflation can happen, and there's plenty of greed and stupidity in the world of bitcoin too.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:04:47
Yes, but what will you give bitcoin for?
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:18:27
It can do even better, and I think it will, but BTC's original advocates won't be happy about it.
The thing is that _when_ bitcoin is stolen, it's possible to discriminate that coin. Obviously for small-scale theft it will be hard to verify whether anything was actually stolen or someone is just trying to get a "chargeback". But for big, well-documented theft that isn't necessary. We don't need to tolerate heists. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:29:47


Many have said for a long time that this was going to happen, that bitcoins inhomogeneity would become a problem (and, incidentally, one mixers can't solve - including decentralised mixing schemes like zerocoin or coinjoin). 
The reason it didn't happen yet was because you shared a libertarian ideology to some degree, and tacitly agreed to not discriminate between coins. But as bitcoin grew, it was inevitable that this would end.

He would have no _economic_ incentive, but everyone is working on the assumption that Satoshi is an idealist anyway, doing it for idealistic reasons. If not, why would you inflate the early mined coins that they surely stacked away?

There's still transaction fees, only SeansOutpost paid them when getting dollars to buy food (and you possibly paid them when you got the bitcoin initially).

Drug trade through SR stood for _a lot_ of the exchange of bitcoin for real-world goods. That's not irrelevant to a currency.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:59:35
Doesn't tell us much. I dare say some people have multiples :) Currency flows can also be falsely inflated, so the best indicator of Silk Road's size is the number of goods on display + the amount confiscated from DPR.

Interesting, a crowdfunding site that takes bitcoin. But I notice that of the seven projects they have up, one is already a vet bill begging project.
For those who don't know the history of crowdfunding, these projects were the scourge of the original Fundable, and is still big on IndieGoGo. (They're banned on Kickstarter of course, and this was likely a big factor in Kickstarter succeeding). Cynics might say that the reason for their abundance is not only that the word spread in the pet rescue community, but also that sad dying puppies are a potential way to get money out of strangers.

It's not unlikely that there was a keylogger on that public library terminal... The FBI probably has DPR's unencrypted bitcoin wallet as well as any message encryption keys of his.

I agree totally. But you realise this is not at all privacy-friendly, and not at all what bitcoin's inventor(s) and early adopters wanted.
I wonder if the price will plummet once this new super-transparent world you sketch gets closer to reality - or whether its current price rather reflects that it's coming.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:02:26


About price tomorrow or in a year I can't say anything, but on this, I'm pessimistic. Bitcoin may be high or it may be low, but it will stay volatile because of its deflation-prone design. 
As soon as it starts getting useful for everyday purposes, it immediately becomes so much more valuable as a speculation object. When it becomes valuable as a speculation object, it keeps rising, because more people buy because they see the price rise. This makes it _less_ attractive for everyday purposes, chipping away at the floor under the valuation. 
Then the crash comes, and lots and lots of speculators are left disappointed and penniless. This sets the stage for BTC becoming useful for everyday purposes again, and the circle starts anew.
There's a reason governments accept a small amount of inflation, and strenuously try to avoid deflation. 
Cash represents a claim on the productive capacity of the economy, but maintaining the productive capacity of the economy isn't free. If you don't exercise your claim, but keep pushing it off into the future, it shouldn't keep its value indefinitely. It should absolutely not grow.

Not nearly as silly as people who think it has any sustainable value as a non-currency.

There is a lot of speculation, sure, but I'm not sure it's the vast majority. If it was, I'd think it would have collapsed long ago. 
It seems fair to assume many people bought bitcoin for the specific purpose of using them on Silk Road.
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:22:44


Sure they would, but they will then have to pay a premium to exchange them for coins they can legally use. Just like you usually must when moving money from an illegal economy to a legal one.

I agree with this, though I think you need to be a bit more specific than property. _Claims_ of all sorts can be managed by distributed ledger, they don't necessarily have to be valid property claims, or claims respected by everyone.
It's already being used this way for names, I understand:

I'm sure it will, but will _you_ trust it? Why?
This isn't like Napster, folks. You didn't really have to trust Napster, as all they shipped was information. Got to have quite a bit more trust in someone collecting your shipping address as opposed to your IP address.
