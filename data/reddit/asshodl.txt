Since this proposal is in line with my desires, I don't need to know miners "reasons", lol.  They each have their own reasons and it would take too much of my valuable time to collate and analyze that data.

Too funny!

Where have you been for the past 2 years?

How short are we on node count right now, dellintelbitcoin? How did you come up with that shortage count?  Or increase node count to some vague number just because?

Maybe it is a response to the HK consensus falling apart and being called dipshits?

Silly, I would certainly find a 500% increase (5x more) very very interesting.  Keeping up with technological advancements is not too much to ask from my cryptocurrency.

It doesn't look super great for ongoing hashrate security.

It is not a rumor.  It is a proposal (with nobody officially signing on yet).  There's a difference.

You probably already know this but profit only counts if you actually take it.  BTC could slide down tomorrow for another multi-year slump.

Yikes! What data are you using to see the patterns.  How bad does it have to get before I need to sell my coins?

That's up to each individual.  USD might work, or gold or chickens or something like that.
