Has anyone had any luck? I deposited money in it as an intermediary account and screwed up not doing enough research. I understand that it used to be a good service.
I did, however, look up that "zoopimchat" company and contacted them directly. I am hoping they can be me in contact with someone as they are a real organization. 
Here is what I sent them:
"To whom this may concern, 
          Zopim supports (or supported) the above-mentioned website for customer support at one point or another. Now however, this website is no longer “active” in the sense that the open sign was left but no one is working. I opened a wallet and send 2.15 bitcoin in it ($500 USD) and cannot make a withdrawal because it is no being supported. 
          I am desperately trying to get in contact with someone from the website in order to get my money back. Can you please direct me to someone who can assist me with this. It is worth mentioning that the name and reputation of Zopim is connected to a website that many believe to be a purposeful agent of fraud.
          Could someone please get back to me and help me figure out how I may make contact with the website moderators or administrators. There are many other individuals who are trying to fix this and have desperately used your “zopimchat” option on the website to have no one respond (no blame on you). 
I am hoping to hear something back from them. I also mentioned the fact that they are tied to this problem as well.
