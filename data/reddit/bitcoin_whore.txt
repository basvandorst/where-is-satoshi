Good questions, I had to figure these out too.  In coinbase, go to account settings, integrations, and you'll see bitcoin paper wallet.  Then, print one (I got confused, but your money stays inside coinbase until you transfer it).  Take your paper wallet off the printer and use the coinbase phone app to send the amount you want to the public key on the paper wallet.  Once it's confirmed, I run over to blockchain and verify that it's on the wallet.  Then I bought a firebox, this one:  and placed my bitcoin paper wallets in there (one bitcoin per one paper wallet, in my case, I think it's better to make a few wallets, whatever your number of coins are).
Edit: as said, it's like a piggy bank, you cannot take a little out, you have to empty a paper wallet all at once, or risk loosing it all.  You can add several times, though.

WTF happened on the 16th?

That's why I used Coinbase's paper wallet feature to send myself my coin, then I put it in a fireproof box.  I thought, hard-drives crash, windows crashes, USB flash drives corrupt, but, paper lasts relatively forever as long as it doesn't burn.

Less risk than hard-drives failing.

The protocol is (not "bitcoin_whore")
I agree with everything you said, and would add to put them in a fireproof box or safe-deposit-box instead of a drawer :)

Then they're stupid.  They missed all the diamonds :)
Sure, you can use a safe deposit box at a local bank instead if you like.
