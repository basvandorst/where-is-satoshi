Don't *totally* forget about it..

If it becomes ubiquitous enough then I can still see that decision reversing, but then again, maybe bitcoin core client won't be the main tool people use by then either.

Coinbase are super interested in this and have had talks where the lead devs of this explained it to all their devs. They also released the footage to youtube because they want this so bad..

How doesn't it?

This will change drastically when lightning makes it to the majority of bitcoin users. The dev's believe that this will have a positive impact on fees due to the reduced load for block mining. It's too early to tell at this point however


It's the opposite way round, the lightning would set you free in this case, many smaller payments which join together in one larger balance transaction with lower total size so lower fees in total compared to doing all those transactions on the blockchain

Depending on your exposure I guess, I don't think everyone has a hardware wallet yet and what else do you use as a client without putting a lot of trust in the 3rd party dev (you're already kinda having to trust the bitcoin devs anyway)

It is, haven't you seen the gif?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:19:06
Because this can be faster, cheaper and potentially scales to many millions of transactions per second instead of Visa's max of 40,000. Also the "second layer" is only a logical abstraction for now, once this is ready I can see it getting merged into core and then it's totally seamless

Exactly the point, channels should be long running things and the best way I can see to explain this is that these lightning channels become essentially your current account/debit card, and your bitcoin wallet is your long term savings. 
Your fiat current account provider can currently either give you interest (negative fees to entice users) or charge some small amount to keep your account open (positive fees to discourage users), Lightning channels are the same in this respect. A monthly/yearly re-opening of a lightning channel to sync the transactions to the blockchain may become the norm, in which case that singular transaction fee becomes fairly trivial.
You don't shut down your current account every time you need to do a transaction, and you wouldn't here either. The only time you really want to close a lightning channel is when you wanted to move some of those funds into your savings (cold/hardware wallet) or into another asset class. Otherwise you'd keep transacting over lightning to keep your BTC liquid.
Ultimately what we've done here is reinvent the gold backed promissory note from the 1800's, but applied modern day technology to it to ensure that nobody can cheat/lie/steal about what they have, or should have, can't fake notes, and destroying one only ever backfires on whoever has it. It's fucking glorious.

Bad troll is bad
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:24:45
From what I know watching the lightning talk from 2015, what happens in that case is that the funds can be forcibly removed from the bad actor by the next person in the chain publishing the lightning transaction to the blockchain. Everyone then has their BTC moved for real and everyone gets paid what was agreed, even the bad actor.

Just like bittorrent couldn't scale, right? \s

these are ideas for an escrow
@_date: 2012-09-27 13:00:32
I'm currently writing a Bitcoin Escrow for UK based residents, in which funding should be possible from practically any town/corner shop. Only issue is getting api access to a bank.

this is a shame, as it's MY account i want to interact with :( i don't want to have to route via a third party to accomplish a task my bank is supposed to accomplish FWIW i'm on halifax too for now
@_date: 2012-09-13 20:03:34
Looking into it. They do have one, but not sure if they allow references or sending money back to people
@_date: 2012-10-25 22:15:10
if you'd like to, you could pm me with your points, i would love to try and fix all these issues :)
@_date: 2012-09-14 06:20:34
i've been looking at business accounts, but still no luck so far :( i may have to have a talk with my bank manager to see what they know?
@_date: 2012-09-13 06:22:52
why not? there are plenty of ways to have a secure interface via a webAPI. It's more a case that bankers don't care unless it makes them billions :(

the idea is to protect both the seller and the buyer, rather than just the buyer (akin to paypal's defaulting to the buyers point of view), once a transaction is in progress it can't be altered, only committed or returned. this is to avoid this sort of attack. 
@_date: 2012-10-27 12:11:23
there is human intervention, up until the one month mark, if a buyer can prove without doubt that they have received dodgy goods, then of course any sane person would refund them. seller/buyer reputation is a good idea, but then new sellers will have issues gaining said trust. 
@_date: 2012-10-25 21:57:09
this is sorted by signed delivery with tracking. which must be valid. i forgot to mention that there will still be human intervention before the month is up, in the event of a deal going bad like this, if the tracking number turns out to be faulty then the seller instantly loses.

Then look for something implementing 2 of 3 key decryption. Give one to your parents and another in the bank
