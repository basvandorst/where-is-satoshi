You know its strange that all these companies openly suppored Seg2x and now thats its failed they are starting to all get on-board to bootstrap Bcash. And funnily enough all of them are dragging their feet on implementing Segwit. 
Can you see the pieces moving together now?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:27:22
Yes, this justifies sitting on peoples fund for 2 - 3 weeks without acknowledging you have it. /sure

Not a fan of roger but apparently the wallet they use dualizes the addresses so this cant happen. It came up a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:56:34
What in dodgy exchanges, that applies to the coins man.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:51:23
Its because bcash is an exact copy of bitcoin, address structure is identical. Segwit addresses dont work though with bcash

Could you host in another country and connect to your shop with tor/vpn?

Yea, it's crazy - world police. Don't think variety Jones was picked up yet. Haven't been following this in a while. There's a fair chance this guy was killed, he ended up in police custody in Thailand with access to millions in crypto? They shake you down for 5 k for a joint.

Is this something to worry about? It seems like a big deal, could there be a break somewhere? Last time I saw an anomoly on the chain it was in the April 2013 run up when we split the chain

If these are pegged to USD, then they are technically breaking the law (counterfeit)

Ha funny story about Valery - met him at a bitcoin conference in 2013 in Amsterdam. End up in a coffee shop with him and we're trading bitcoin stories. He says they are in chip manufacture. In my stoned mind, I was thinking 'Wow, must be some nifty electrical engineer'. 
So I said to him, 'How did you get into chip manufacturing?'. And he turns to me and says 'First we get the scientists, then we get the factory, then we make the chips...' in a think Eastern accent.

Strangely, though this bank is promoting bitcoin here, runs accelerators for startups which sponsor bitcoin companies they wont let you open a bank account if you are dealing with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-10 16:04:29
They will ban or make hard outline bitcoin use cases (e.g. localbitcoins/NY License - ATM's). This will concentrate bitcoin users into a flock which are easily identifiable by ID (Much like a bank and cash). Then will then make it less funglble (already happening at bitpay etc.). They will then require all reporting of bitcoin activity. They will then link all this together and deny anyone transaction in bitcoin - cash, blacklisted bitcoin or any underreported cash, severing more and more links back to fiat. They will then coop it under bankings wings with even more regulation. Then will then use the blockchain to unite their own power under the distributed ledger becoming the last superpower - under bitcoin. A huge monopoly of banks, corporations and government united under one flag - a B.

Here 6 years and I have to agree. Its very tense times outside this circle (bitcoin - general). Even with limited and possibly expensive transactions (1$), this currency/ledger/x could look very good in the near future. They're all based on faith after all.

Oh, thats been out ages. I understand why he did it, it makes money. Similar to the wallets he starts, makes things much simpler for the average person. Exchanges can be daunting.

Every six months theres an article on here about the isle of man leading the bitcoin whatever.
I think they are great at self promotion but otherwise I dont see any evidence of anything else

It's a peer to peer exchange, peers run their own nodes.

Funny, guy from cryptocoast in dun laoghire had a meeting in the basement of rothschilds bank to explain bitcoin to them only last year. I saw the pictures. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 06:57:45
Did he?

I tried blue wallet last week and I it's had out. Custodial bug if it's only for a few quid, that's all good.

It's been on done many times already. Never took off check out onename for instance. There are a couple from the early days of btc

This last bit, can someone verify this, how can they steal back a signed signature?
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:19:42
This was done years ago, multiple protocols for it. Check out coin prism which shut down this year, it's a coloured coins protocol, also much of what the banks was working on was similar and also open sourced eventually.
