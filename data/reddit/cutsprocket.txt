Ugh what a thing to wake up to
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:49:25
Seems to be the trend lately. Organised hacker attack or just scammers hoping to get away while attention is on gox?
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:07:52
OH GOD MY PORTFOLIO. meh I'll buy some more.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:43:59
I do, its ok and trollbox is entertaining as hell.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:21:03
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:37:51
I know the feeling, was getting a little freaked myself and came here to find out what the deal was.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:38:04
I'm wondering how they plan to track it at all. Should be impossible until you cash out. I'd also like to know how they have he right to tax it at all.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:04:00
I was happy that i caught the low with my buy before the sudden jump. If it drops ill just buy again. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:30:28
We'll shit, guess multiple currency miners are in for some fun

@_date: 2014-04-03 23:27:07
BTC-E is bulgarian isn't it? wonder how they will react if at all.
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:20:54
load the ship with the rocket fuel Ho Kogan we goin to the moon.
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:57:01
Amen dude, I managed to buy right at the bottom of the drop and i couldn't be happier
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:45:54
holy fuck. I guess Getbitcoin.com.au will have to stick with their commonwealth bank account now. Really bites since NAB deposits is how i was buying my BTC
@_date: 2014-03-22 11:45:15
threshold is around 500 i'd say, once it dips below that people will buy.
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:29:04
Gas station cashier, cashier at a pawn brokers and soon to be a burger flipper at the city jail. I get around.
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:07:26
its about damn time.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:32:58
now thats comedy
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:42:54
I'm really sorry to hear that, I hope this is the rock bottom before the rise of your fortunes 
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:15:00
well done you managed to get one up on the  financial institutions.
@_date: 2014-03-22 12:11:45
let me know how it goes, it could be a convenient way to cash out in the future.
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:39:53
ah so they probably don't give a shit then.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:19:28
Only btc counts so your ltc and doge is fine
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:46:00
400 gold, buy 1 Btc then put the rest into silver or more gold.
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:36:57
thats a good point actually
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:22:38
use* goddamit
@_date: 2014-06-06 13:01:53
very cool, just bought a cassette from them.

At least Australia got their taxation sorted out simply. 10% GST on sales and purchase + any wealth generated is taxed like income (something like 25%?)
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:31:25
well done, earned yourself some real life karma 
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:17:18
that's true, can't say I have.
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:21:58
nope can't say I was
@_date: 2014-07-27 07:14:32
send shovels to help bury their dead
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:25:23
Look at it from their perspective. Accepting bitcoin as payment circumvents their fee calculation system and they wouldn't get their cut.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:44:04


Sweet jesus, I don't mean to rub it in but why didn't you transfer it when the trouble began?
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:15:10
I was hoping to use it to buy and sell so I can see how the service compares to other exchanges such as BTC-E
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:06:08
God I love the internet. So, where do I invest?
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:38:22
haha thanks for the info. I wish I had the kind of money like Dick Branson does, investing a million into something like Churbbies would  be worth the media shitstorm. It's not a million but I'm happy to donate $10 to help you realise your dream.
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:03:05
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:07:03
oh god you're right lmao
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:46:26
well to be fair if that's all you had you should be working anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:29:32
nice lookin shoes, price seems pretty good too.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:50:07
well at least you have each other
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:19:13
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:28:28
getbitcoin.com.au is where I buy my coins. you end up paying about 4.4% but the rate is decent enough.
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:06:21
can I deposit say .1btc and play micro or do i need big money?
@_date: 2014-01-07 07:47:40
oh wow that's the biggest tip I've ever seen given on reddit. Cudos to you dude.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:13:21
just wondering about the sponsor/donation. say a churbbie is $15 and I sponsor $10, when they are finally in production will I have $5 remaining to  pay or an additional $15?
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:09:12
Poorly planned greed. Say what you will about banks but at least 99% of the time they are well organised
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:51:39
I paid 1 BTC but at the time it was worth 3 USD
@_date: 2012-02-23 11:31:34
yup just a patch with velcro on the back.
@_date: 2011-12-07 07:23:40
question about intersango, i live in australia so is it even possible for me to use  them?
@_date: 2011-12-07 11:44:54
dang, guess ill have to find a reliable site that uses AUD and doesnt charge out the ass
@_date: 2011-12-07 07:18:09
that and the idea of the merit badge is to introduce people to bitcoin and get them involved
@_date: 2011-12-06 23:42:18
oh thank you!
@_date: 2011-12-07 11:45:08
you're welcome, apparently they add more every now and then
@_date: 2011-12-06 23:41:27
@_date: 2011-12-06 23:41:58
ill look into it, thanks for the info
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:34:26
ahh thankyou
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:34:25
Potentially lost about $500USD myself. I'm not happy about it but I guess that's the risk you run gambling with Slavs.
@_date: 2015-02-27 11:12:31
i miss the days of 600+ BTC prices
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:13:04
man those were some fun times too.
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:11:24
God damn world police
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:08:53
Huh guess I just lost $500USD
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:37:12
thats something i could live with i think.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:37:12
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:23:03
Bank is open on saturday mornings here so yeah id be happy with it taking a few days myself. either way i suppose.
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:10:34
makes a guy wonder if the china situation was all market manipulation
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:12:26
ah that explains it then, thought it was a bit sudden even for btc. Should recover it a few days i reckon but if not time to buy again
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:54:02
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:55:29
eh so the ass falls out of the market for a little while. big deal.
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:26:34
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:18:20
I had a dig around an old laptop myself last week and found .003btc. was nice.
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:24:27
damn it must be good to be rich. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:26:18
meh I held. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:43:24
yep seems to be. thats a little concerning
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:51:55
ah good my wallet is ready
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:52:06
thats a damn nice find.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:24:10
Crash, Rise, Bubble, whatever im still going to put money into it when I can regardless of value. its fun being part of an emerging system.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:43:10
yeah I know the feeling, twice now in the last month ive bought coins and both times the price has tanked but the way i see it thats only a problem when you compare it to fiat. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:58:27
weekend Dip on a Tuesday/Wednesday.
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:24:47
true enough, its really all you can do until we have a working bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:01:09
as someone planning on investing soon I hope so.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:53:26
[About that moon....](
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:16:17
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:57:06
Just because is value compared to Fiat drops doesnt mean I have any less bitcoins than I did yesterday. Holding and investing as price and spare funds dictate.
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:19:54
SAS and a brick wall
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:34:24

now thats a suicide trigger
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:58:58
im giving it another 36-48 hours myself but why the fuck not.
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:30:35
well i say goodluck to you but personally i wouldnt go all in like that
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:24:36
you've lost nothing til you sell for less.
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:13:26
BTC-E isnt bad. come join us.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:28:13
when if at all do you sell though?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:57:48
god no even as sex toys go that thing looks nasty
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:31:21
i just throw in what i can afford from week to week. this week i put in 100. last week nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:05:51
