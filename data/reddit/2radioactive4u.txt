How do you envision bitcoin regulation in Canada over the course of the first term of the Liberal government? What influence do you think Kyle Kemper may play qiven the fact he is JT's half brother?

buying through localbitcoins can also be viewed as a type of TFSA, tax free savings account but for money laundering. Lets say you had cash money on hand and no easy way to port it back to legit cash. Buy a bunch of Bitcoin with it. Depending how you wallet up a person can make their investment untouchable by government and as each day passes it seemingly becomes easier to use anywhere in the world....  it is a form of transferable wealth that also has a very real possibility of increasing in value. I am sure people are viewing this as an opportunity to put an egg in a different basket. 
Lets say you pay 5% more than spot..... well, laundering money can cost a whole lot more that that.

be very careful with their trigger limit. I have seen flash crashes with them that last for only a couple of minutes but eat through every ones set trigger limits. Back in December saw this a couple of times with Cavirtex and I decided that I would never use a trigger limit with them again. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:10:44
Cool. Can accomplish this with coinkite vouchers as well.

This is actually good news
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:51:59
I bought one of these about a month ago. Some things worth mentioning are the fees. When you are buying and selling you can choose what exchange price to use as well what premium to a max of 20%, however coinkite keeps half of any premium you charge!
Debit cards- if you go with a free coinkite account there is a 1% withdrawal transaction fee anytime you use it, or remove coins from you coinkite wallet
If you leave your coinkite wallet/debit card without funds in it for 1 month or longer. The next time you put coins in you will be charged 0.02 BTC as an inactivity fee. 
Please correct me if I am wrong here rnvk.

nice one!
@_date: 2014-02-22 06:02:50
I hear what you are saying.
 For me it is not okay that I now have to trade around $250,000 to $300,000 before I get a 0.1% drop in my trading fees. Where as when I first started using them less than a year ago, it was only $40,000. 
It is not respectful.

thanks, my twitter was not updating properly.

this will send waves out. It cannot be overstated how big this is. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:37:29
this is a big step towards empowering communities. Consider the current situation- a bleed rate of 1.5%- 3% from businesses anytime a credit card is accepted. Imagine businesses and eventually consumers alike automatically donating a percentage of BTC anytime they receive BTC. 
Example: someone spends $10 worth of BTC at a local coffee shop, that business is using coinkite and automatically sends 0.5% of that revenue to a local charity. 
Instead of money being removed from a locality into the coffers of a multinational corporation, it is now nesting itself within a community allowing for potential growth and healing. 
If this was done on a large scale within a community, I believe it would be transformational. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:43:03
please fix question 2, there is no choice for age range from 35 to 44. 
Also, Cavirtex just did a survey with almost the same questions as yours. They posted link to r/bitcoin. Look it up, I am sure you could make really good use of it. Cheers. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:43:01
Excellent write-up! Thank-you for sharing your perspective.
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:31:33
I feel it is past due for Cavirtex to change their volume based fees from BTC volume to CDN equivalent volume because as it stands now you have to trade around $300,000 CDN before having a 0.1% reduction from 1.5% to 1.4% for your transaction fee. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 05:31:38
rebittance can evolve even further still through an action called transations. Where any instance an individual moves value from their wallet a set % on top of that amount, say .0005% is automatically given to enities of their choosing (quite likely to local charities, such as a womens shelter)
 Social pools could be created with set goals which incentivize their peers to contribute through transations towards a set intention. Gradually the power which we have been freely giving to corporations (arguably around 2% per transaction) would become harnessed and many of us would bear witness to its fruit on the most intimate of local levels. 
Imagine what your community would be like if even just a fraction of all the money leaving your community through different transaction fees was to be consciously diverted to things which nurtured and empowered it, and for this to compound year upon year.... It would be beautiful :)

this is the largest bitcoin exchange in Canada. Unfortunately they also have the highest fees. They have been stating for quite sometime that LTC trading would be added to the exchange. Today it seems about to come true.

In Canada, any person with a Royal Bank account can use interac e-transfer on facebook. 
This form of payment probably has Facebook very interested. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:26:22
cavirtex charges a fee of .001 BTC for every BTC withdrawal. It was implemented maybe 6-8 weeks ago. They also charge 1.5% transaction fee for buying and selling. This fee is volume based over 120 days. To reduce to 1.4% you need to have a volume of over 400 BTC. In Canada at the moment this is the only exchange with real volume on it. Vault of Satoshi is growing but does not offer everything Cavirtex does at this time. Bitstamp charging a 0.5% transaction fee and maybe soon a miners fee for withdrawals is NOTHING! Pucker up Buttercup,  you gots it good!!!

It is never smart business to create a negative energy with your customer base. This negativity is beginning to permeate all through the crypto reddit scape. When the next wave of Canadians go to sign up on a bitcoin exchange it will be enough to sway some away from cavirtex
