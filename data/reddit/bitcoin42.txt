I don't want to sound cheeky, are you aware how often you use closed source software in your life? Also, nobody is expecting from you to put your life savings into this. I think hardly anyone did that with Bitcoin in the first years. If you are such a precautions person run it from a Virtual Machine. It's good to be precautions but your comment is plainly put fear mongering.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:00:50
Just check out what Lighthouse is about. A decentralized crowd funding platform and it's AIMED to be completed in August...  As far as I understand it, you could do that with Bithalo/ Blackhalo and Shitcoinhalo (once open source), right now already.

What else have I mentioned besides of the distribution of shares? (Which is only one out of many functions peershares client can do). Please do me the favor to read yourself more into the tools I have pointed out for you, for better understanding. Also you might want to read this: 
Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:11:10
You sit down together with other individuals and write down the purpose of the company ect.  similar to a birth certificate you would register at a notaries,  but instead you use proofofexistence.com to verify the authenticity, and to ensure that nobody of the founders breaks the formed agreement you create a smartcontract with the BlackHalo.info client. If you want to distribute shares you use for you customized peershare client. Its extremely flexible what you can do with all that. And you can basically trust it as much as you trust in the Blockchain. Edit: I can see where you are trying to go with this. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:33:58
Information now also on 
@_date: 2014-07-09 02:41:22
You are correct. There where talks to release it open source from day one, but i think like darkcoin's "darksent" function is so valuable and needs to be protected from the extreme copycat behaviors these days, the call was made to keep it first closed.
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:25:06
Or rather a faster and more secure coin like bitshares-x or blackcoin?

It more gets like a decentralized Ebay,  paypal kind of deal. Localbitcoins is so backwards. I would have agreed with you a month ago, but not anymore after seeing what powerful tools some individuals and free minds are working on right now. And my gut feeling is telling me just like in 2010 when i found bitcoin that this going to be big. (Also  i think that is how Bitcoin will reach mass adoption.) Edit: by keeping true to itself and creating new sectors in the same spirit.)

Wow... And all this for Vaporware! LOL. Check   ... that makes Etherium pretty much unnecessary imo. And that without Blockchain bloat or middlecoin.
@_date: 2014-12-19 09:30:07
Agreed. But only because it has never been done means it will never happen. There have been already unintended 51% happenings though in the past by too large pools and version conflicts. But I think since we have seen massive mining farms, the dynamics are different now. There is a risk of a malicious actor. Of course it's not  cheap,  but I think with the salary of a Tiger Woods you could do it. Now think what a government could do. Seize a farm and goodbye bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, I'm don't want to bash here, or spread fud,  just make aware of the risks and that these came into place because imo people tend to forget how important decentralization is, and think Satoshi is some kind of God who knew about all possibilities in the future.

I guess because if you are in it for both you will make different decisions. Watch the Video to the end, he says that sentence in regards to a previous question,  why not send the deposits of failed contracts to himself. He could do that,  but then you have middlemen again,  exactly that's what he wants to remove.

they dont do creditcard... or did they add this now? Would be cool.
@_date: 2014-09-19 14:24:48
because it is not build like bitcoin, simply put. They wrote entire new code, and I do honor the awesome work and long tested network of the mother of all coins. Then of course you could argue over its distribution method. Others have made a way better approuch. Just to mention one argument.
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:57:52
Problem solved.  
The genius invention of David Zimbeck, makes it possible: Double Deposit Escrow, makes escrow possible without the need to trust middlemen,  neither the 2nd party. Complete trustless exchange of anything!  Pretty mind blowing!

@_date: 2014-08-14 01:24:02
I agree. Although, here I would subject:


People have good incentives to sell mining hardware. Mining is not profitable for the average Joe. I have been mining since early 2011 and always upgraded, reinvested. But I made the math and realized that its time to put your faith somewhere else if you belief in decentralization and the stuff satoshi wrote in the whitepaper.
Not only in regards to the technological advances in the meanwhile protocol wise. (not only PoS).


I disagree. That scenario might even be likely to happen, but is far away from being secure. Yet alone it does not fit with one of the core ideas behind bitcoin, which is that you do not need trust. By putting your faith into 10 companies or so that they behave benevolent and not malicious ... hui ... We are basically with mining pools at that situation right now, and only because of the honesty a pool bitcoin is still alive. We are at the goodwill of the pools. All it needs is some greed and Bitcoin will go into history as a failed experiment, and everybody will move on.
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:57:56
Bithalo.org will have NightTrader built in. The Blackcoin version Blackhalo works already in a rudimentary way. But it works!

 Thats why you create for each transaction a new public key... seriously. People using Public key as an equivalent to a bank account number is just silly.

Where can you get a vps for 20usd a year? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 07:31:26
Agreed to trust the code and not the person. Although I feel it's harsh from you to say I missed the point "completely". You have to outweighedu things in perspective. People need to trust something. If it's not the code they can trust then at least the coder. It's not that he is hiding and does not feel accountable for what he publishes. I think Bitcoin itself still could have been a success even with closed or audited source,  if the creator(s)  would not be held in obscurity. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:03:48
I'm not going to convince you or give you an argument since you seem to be already very biased. Try it yourself,  explore it and understand what just hit you.

Of course. But my customers worry that a 51% will then be even more easier as it is today,  since incentives will not be high in of to secure the network. The only thing which could make it profitable is to SPECULATE that deflation will be so high that it's worth it. A bet some think is too risky and rather shift to evolved solutions.
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:53:42
Bitpay, does accept 0/unconfirmed txs, because they understand the risk and pay for double spends from their own pocket.
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:40:52
My bad. I'm responsible for the Web page and I have been a 100% Bitcoin believer since 2011 but Blackcoin is as radical as Bitcoin back in those days. That's why I gave Blackcoin preference but will work on the Bithalo page ASAP! 
@_date: 2014-12-19 08:55:57
Please read up what possibilities you have with a 51% attack and why we are scared of it. A double spent is the smallest issue, and you do not need 51% network power to do so. I agree it's surly not an easy task,  you would need to coordinate a lot, perhaps write special trading bots. Have many zombie accounts etc. I don't want to get into numbers. But the damage would be massive and you definitely can achieve a return of your investment and beyond. Also, it would be actually be extremely difficult to make someone accountable, and I think you are a bit naive to compare the scenario with credit card fraud.

Thats why Proof of Stake is so great. Instead of "one hash, one vote", its "one coin, one vote". Mining, or in this case staking is way fairer IMO, because everyone can be part of securing the network.

It's true,  you don't mine,  instead you stake. But there is still afford behind this,  it just way more efficient and effective. Network security is still given due incentives of activity securing the network by raising the difficulty for attacks. Checkout Pavels aka Rat4 PoS 2.0. Its almost like as if you say that manual labor has value and intellectual work is worthless. Its not the best comparison,  but i hope you get my point.

You need permission to use cash. Cash is worthless, imo it that anyway,  but the cash has value because it's enforced by an central authority,  which permits its use. Not so with bitcoin.

It is totally unnecessary to do this in a testnet. Blackcoin's POS 2.0 has been in testnet and so has Bitcoin million times. This client works on and with the Blockchain of the coins as far as I understand it. You are talking as if this would be an alt. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:16:47
How did it go? 
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:03:59
"And we're not the ones paying for it, miners are."
We are going to pay for it one way or the other. Without miners no security, without security no value. PoW has proofed itself very useful when it comes to decentralized distribution, (although a egalitarian PoW would make this today better, like cryptonote for example), but I think Proof of Stake will eventually need to take over to keep the network secure and decentralized. A small compound interest like BlackCoin has it is also not a bad idea after there are so many coins lost.
@_date: 2014-09-20 10:17:43

Stop talking about double spents. With the monopoly on hashing power you can REVERSE transactions while you are in control ! So you can spend your coins over weeks, and then get them all back, and quickly sell them again. But that would not even be your first tactics,  because that you only can do once,  if lucky twice. There are much more subtle things you can do to benefit,  with good chances nobody realize this. They can follow 'selfish mining' procedures to earn more than it's fair share of the block rewards. This was introduced in this paper:  . You can earn more fees as you should. You can get every single block reward. You can exchange them without the need of putting them to altcoins,  although that's not even a bad idea to put them into bitusd etc. But Aml/kyc is your smallest worry, if you have the funds to pull this off it's a walk in the park to get strawman bank accounts on Island countries. And you can scramble the network so badly nobody would even realize what hit them.  Suddenly your balances would just disappear. It would be a nightmare. And most bitcoiners are completely ignorant towards this. Maybe you want to read this one: 
@_date: 2014-07-11 08:18:56

@_date: 2014-04-12 01:26:43
Yeah. One way to avoid that is to park your car for 7$ per day in front of the border and walk over. A cab will take you for around 60 pesos or 5 USD right to the Bitcenters door. (Its a 7-10 minute ride). The walk back is much faster. Specially when you take the Otay crossing and not the San Ysidro one. ;)
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:44:21
It was first built for Bitcoin (Bithalo) but then David Zambeck noticed how unpractical it is in real world settings and picked Blackcoin as the more superior alternative,  and made Blackhalo. Bithalo and Blackhalo are the same and theoretically any alt could use this client on top. But for now source is closed,  because just like Darksent  in Darkcoin this thing is very valuable.

As a miner you might want to consider this.    But he seems not to know about that altcoins have already successfully so far showed some solutions,  and that we can make those changes into Bitcoin. But miners will need to allow this change. But in the end the change will be done by price. Visa/Mastercard 60cent, Bitcoin 5-15cent, some altcoins below 1cent per transaction.

It is not different from the "normal"  obsolescence cycle of computers.

Did you actually try the Program? It totally not works the way how you describe it.


He advocates it due to it's technical superiority, but mainly for it's usability. He made it for Bitcoin at first but got bored waiting 10 minutes each time to get a contract go through. If he's really interested in profit, he just could have created his own coin for this purpose instead, like all the competitors are doing.


Why does this disappoint you? Only if you are a owner of huge mining gear this should bother you. And even if, this client can work with any coin, be it Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Shitcoin1000... 


Actually this why I got enthusiastic about it because it's less promising and more doing.
The bottom line is, I would urge you to take a closer look, or just look again.

I use the term Vaporware in a sense that there is much more talk (vapor) about a software as an actual working software,  which address adequately many real world issues. They have some early alpha to show?  What else? So far the only usable thing i have came across is bithalo. It just does it without talk. just like bitcoin just did it 2009. For me that is truly disruptive software,  which does not ask permission or for funding to innovate. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:35:43
Actually there are already many building decentralized companies,  decentralized exchanges,  decentralized coinbases if you wish. Sure,  ignoring them (centralized law and regulators) is not a solution,  but willfully undermining them  and deligitimizing their authorities is another case. And that might be what you are perceiving here. What I've noticed over the past years is that we more than ever,  need values and ethics, but especially responibility how we want to deal with all this. Making laws and calling to cooperate with centralized governments is just trying to find someone else, who is not you or me to deal with it. A company following these laws ultimately will make thing expensive. You get mass adoptions not by huge companies or governments you can trust, but by cheap or free solutions,  which the masses will understand with no advertising or pr. And to have that truly working,  you need to keep it decentralized. Everything else raises the price on the longterm.

Might be true. I would also tend to your views. But only because the events are not chronological,  does not necessarily mean it's non sense. Might just be convenient. But really,  in my opinion this is bike shedding. Bitcoin has much bigger problems to face,  and I wonder when it comes out of it denial. Hopefully not when it's too late. Transaction fees are too high and the network very inefficient. At least with DelegatePOS there is something useful done with fees. Much faster and cheaper to. Sorry,  it's off topic.

So Satoshi Nakamoto is not a stranger for you? Wow, can you give me his contact please, I would love to talk to him, because otherwise I will not trust Bitcoin. ;)  Kidding. But seriously. I think you are getting down votes because your statements sound unbalanced and uninformed. I just used the client with some cents and could see in and outputs in the blockchain. Obviously security culture is important and nobody should leave money they can not afford to lose in this experimental software. Everything in crypto is still EXPERIMENTAL software! A pretty amazing experiment so far. I'm as happy right now as back in 2010 when i first discovered Bitcoin. This is a truly a innovative game changer, which is there to make the world a better, decentralized place  :p  btw. I'm stepping slowly back as a Bitcoin evangelist when it comes to decentralization, because it is actually getting more and more centralized. Look for instance to checkpoints, master nodes and the decline of active nodes due to bloated Blockchain. Gavin mentioned this recently that this could become a problem, i think it is one already. Not to mention the centralization due to mining farms, which also threaten the network from 51% attacks.

It could take weeks ,  even month's until the market realized. The miner can make a longer chain,  but not publish it. Make trades to it's favor. Then bam, reverse all previous transactions with his "correct" blockchain, and revert the coins back to his possession. Then make a another rinse,  but now fast,  since it could be spotted. But the first could already be profitable in of. There are really a variety of thing you can do,  and it can go unnoticed for a while,  if the attacker is malicious. That's the scary part of an 51% attack.

See how biased you are,  this is not only a exchange.  you get smart contracts. The possibilities are groundbreaking. On the other hand,  well I can tell you from a brick and mortar Bitcoin ATM operators perspective that the Blackcoin protocol would be much better for day to day use. I m not a Alt fan but I'm tiered of the developers stagnation in the Bitcoin sphere. (Not to mention that Bitcoin is getting more and more centralized). Why is Bitcoin not addressing the real world problems we are facing and is not implementing the solutions the Alts,  in this case Blackcoin are successfully demonstrating. Is it invested interest by the miners? Anyhow. I too have no time. good night.

Genesis1 Operator here. I feel with the Lamassu operator. As long there is no regulation we take benefit of the doubt.
You should edit that the Genesis1 also does Lite- and Dogecoin. (more in the making, strongly hoping on Blackcoin)
The KYC can also be made, besides the optional fingerprint scanner, in the USA and Mexico by reading out data from Driver Licenses, Gov. ID cards via Qr-code or magnet stripe, and reading out bank card info.

Use a customized peershares client to distribute the companies future profits in a decentralized way. All contracts (with employees or/and company owners/ founders) which need to be made are enforced and insured with the help of BitHalo, a smart contracting client. Better BlackHalo since it's faster and more secure. proofofexistence.com can be used validate the integrity of the contacts being made. Communications run over a advanced bitmessage fork and the companies website has the domain registered as  a .bit domain using namecoin, but a proxy will still enable the general public to reach the domain. Funding for the company is done via swarm crowdfunding,  empowered by counterparty. Any product can be sold over Openbazaar or NightTrader. Any product can  be dispatched using any form of delivery service available. To have a physical store where customers can walk in will be a bit tricky,  but depending on the country's laws there might well be the one or other loophole or tick to work around that, for example by using a club,  society or whatnot....
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:20:57
Maybe the BitHalo website will help for your better understanding. (Also it's kept more in black letters on white background for the conservative readers. :p  )  LightHouse seems to be very specific in its functions, where as BitHalo is way broader. Anyhow. We need it all. Lighthouse, BitHalo, good innovative Altcoins, and maybe some mining pools who go out and destroy some shitcoins. Would be very easy for most of them to wipe them out in a 51% attack's... Bitcoin is also vulnerable to that. Its pocket change for some States or Banks:

The paper you are referring to is outdated and pretty much obsolete and based on early Sumnyking PoS model. Much has happened since then. Check out PoS 2.0 from Blackcoin. Also you can not apply the critics from NAS to DPOS,  because Stakers are not all coin owners,  but as the word D stands for,  voted, constantly interchangeable Delegates. So,  to do and NAS attack you would first need to become a active delegate, but even that would be useless,  because from my understanding you are not even "staking" with the alleged nothing /coin.

Jordan Kelly himself tried to convince me that the Genesis1 does not work. PM if you want more advice. Where are you located!?  There are other manufacturers I can recommend too, depending on your needs.   (Edit: Yes,  Skyhook is a toy and  the building instructions can be found online, just search open source bitcoin atm. And Lamassu seem very limited, unless you want to start coding the software yourself.)

Agree to disagree.  I've read the paper and we tried to use it. Didn't work. In short,  NaS problem is not a problem because if there would be nothing at stake, there would be nothing to worry about. ;p  And actually Blackcoin PoS 2.0 has addressed NaS,  and not only obfuscated. Maybe in your opinion it's only obfuscated because you don't understand it, but what rat4 did is to incentives  staking, and therefore harden the chance for anyone to attack.
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:47:16
1. Seems DPOS is more secure than Bitcoins PoW currently. Since it's running it had less security issues than PoW,  well,  thanks to Bitcoin for that making the start. But basically it more difficult to corrupt/manipulate 101 Delegates compared to 4 mining pools. 
For me Bitcoin is a Blackandwhite Tv from the old days and Bitshares a 3D 4k Flatscreen Tv.

I read about it autumn 2010. Started Mining in  that Winter. Was a time where I would research anything about open source and Decentralization, which I love and concluded would be a reliable system which can genuinely help heal the planet. Started mining with cpu, then gpu, started to doubt where the hardware specialisation would lead us to, but to test got the first fpga,  then asic... and realized that it's too centralized, wasteful and vulnerable to risk that a large entity could manipulate. Sold my last bitcoins and started a Bitcoin Startup, by setting up two crypto coin atms in Tijuana, educate people, and help spreading adoption. I  remain to support Bitcoin, but at the same time warn about it's short commings and praise any solutions which solve issues,  or and come up with new,  elegant ways to follow the spirit. Lately mainly Bitshares, Blackcoin, BlackHalo, and some Peercoin developments.

Sorry , i noticed you understood me partly wrong due to my poor english. Anyhow. I wish to see all the best for eutherium,  i just think its for now totally overrated,  and there are other projects which deserve attention,  like bithalo for example. What i was saying is,  that Bitcoin in its early years did not need the hype eutherium is getting. That's a well know fact, and if you think there are otherwise conspiring forces at work,  let me know your theories. I see similarities between Bitcoins and Bithalos early days,  because they are similar disruptive,  and don't get picked up instantly. I am utterly amazed that the bitcoin subreddit and else where was so far only able to attack and down vote it. This really amazes me how ignorant the bitcoin scene within itself is. Instead a everyone focuses on something which we might only see really working next year...  anyhow,  i think i made my point. Looking forward to see how it all turns out. we're on the same boat!

Yes I read their ToS. It's ridiculous. They are basing their reasons on that Bitcoin is a "script"!  What do they want on their servers,  a family blog?

Dear Mr. Hahn,
please note that you are in breach of our ToS by using bitcoin tools which are generating unreasonably cpu usage.
Please stop using those tools, otherwise we are unfortunately forced to suspend your services.

so sad that bithalo.org  is not mentioned. Successfully doing smart contracts with it since almost a year now.

Awesome wallet. But swiping Private keys would be amazing!
