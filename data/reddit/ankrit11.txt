One look at him and you should know not to trust the dweeb. His teeth have so much plaque that it looks like 1 big tooth. Fuck that guy
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:50:25
They are, aren't they?
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:49:51
Never. With that small of amount just HOLD
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:12:46
Just open a new coinbase acct with their bank info......

VPN worth a try
@_date: 2019-03-19 03:00:39
Especially altcoin volumes
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:38:26
Just purchase through Coinbase directly to the address you have on the app. You can then send that to wherever you want to store it or just keep on coinbase short term.
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:36:52
It's a meme. Smh. Your little comment didn't help any either
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:49:18
Where did you buy?!
@_date: 2019-10-12 01:55:12
Dang, you sound cool.
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:04:45
I mean, I'd personally way rather invest my money or time with people that can laugh all the way to the bank over some overly sophisticated tightwads that sell after 12% gains. 
Without some level immaturity surrounding BTC and crypto there would be no room for growth IMO.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:11:22
@_date: 2019-02-02 02:23:26
Also, fuck  and bittrex, scammers.

"There is nothing whole"... what a chode. Lol. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 19:55:48
Umm what?!?! They don't have an exchange wallet that the losses come out of? Instead they steal it from customers.. WOW 
I've said it for 2 years now, "Fuck Poloniex!"
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:48:47
Lmao this made me think it was a larp too.
@_date: 2019-02-27 01:38:30
Just buy on coinbase, wouldn't recommend any mobile wallets. 
Store on coinbase or get a ledger/trezor cold storage. Depending on what you plan to do with the BTC.. Daytrade, alt coins, buy and hold etc it makes a difference where you keep it. I recommend cold storage. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:26:18
Envelopes of cash are pretty anonymous. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 02:23:06
Damn bro you need that $ to make custom shoes for those hooves. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:06:49
Yes the local dealer is a ripoff. Don't do that. Bitcoin ATMs are ok, still a bit higher fees than coinbase but safe. Have to use cash though
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:36:55
You ever tried running a pajeet scam? 
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:38:59
Jesus christ are you trolling or just an idiot?
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:27:24
Also, if you really need it to be anonymous tell your friend to stop being a pussy and just use BTC or XMR. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:41:39
If it sells for BTC it should be at a steep discount since no one really wants to spend BTC knowing it's in a bull market... smh
@_date: 2019-02-20 04:49:42
How do you purchase your BTC? Coinbase, ATM? 
@_date: 2019-06-09 14:53:09
Til it rockets to 10k in August. Accumulation period.
@_date: 2019-02-13 01:26:34
I like that.. how long did the process take to figure out and how long did it take to convert BTC to Gift Card once you did? 
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:28:26
Hmmm smart enough tech-wise to have 100 BTC in 2011.. too dumb to figure out how to get retrieve them in 2019? Gtfo L-A-R-P
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:42:00
Lol ����✌
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:20:13
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:00:40
If your friends hassle you over a $100 "investment" then you're already a 'looser'
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:01:48
Cool bro. Wish I could be you
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:56:03
Apparently some Redditors think that Reddit is too sophisticated for jokes etc. These people are called "douchebags" in the real world.
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:18:57
Sell 100 BTC. 
Fuck the taxes, bs etc. Just sell them. That will be plenty for you to live happily on for years. 
Keep the rest. You'll know what to do with them later. 
 
That is all. �������� 
My family would glady take .25btc donations ����

That hair is so luxurious.
@_date: 2019-01-27 00:58:04
Just have to verify your acct. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:12:32
It was pretty legit.. used it alot. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:10:40

Spread that wealth of knowledge young grasshopper. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 17:43:07
Literally sold my position on a coin I had sitting on there for 6 months, bought another that dipped hard after doing the swap. Still mad about the dip, but it could have been much worse. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:34:49
Lol! 
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:11:19
Oh man that would huge. Volume at each exchange would be insane help 
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:36:08
Welcome back, how was your trip to the future? I see you took a screenshot of BTC price. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:31:50
Used it to buy TRX 14 months ago.. trollbox was legit AF 
@_date: 2019-01-28 21:18:28
I got an email saying their site is shutting down.
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:18:54
Uh, I buy on Coinbase and transfer right away. Is this FUD? 
@_date: 2019-01-02 13:57:52
I like it, but one thing missing from all of these arbitrage sites is VOLUME, a very key element when trying to arbitrage properly. Without volume, these are misleading.

Some tits in the red. Nice
@_date: 2019-09-07 14:10:56
U bet on Serena and Nadal to lose? Should have used that $175 as toilet paper instead, would have gotten some use out of it.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:52:34
They have free version I think.. i use them because they accept crypto, specifically their own PRIX token, gotta support the movement. 
Try HOXX VPN. Legit for free, can select what country you want etc. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:19:22
Daaaaaaaaaamn. That's a couple more than me 
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:23:01
Why couldn't you tell me this last week? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:59:20
Never have. Be careful, rough waters out there.
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:04:15
I'm a circus juggler with these knives. Lmk what shit you into. Hit me with a DM. I blew one last week but been crushing recent 2 week holds 
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:45:47
I waited til 4100. Will sound great someday lol
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:54:12
Use VPN. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:30:13
Wait til eth goes below $100 again in a week. Get 40 of em. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:21:16
You set a price to buy/sell at. When btc touches that price your order is fulfilled. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:53:01
Damn whats the marketcap?!
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:35:13
Teach me the way, master. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:29:05
U send it FROM the trezor. No need to even use the exchange except to get your  BTC address that you will be sending to? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:43:37
Some people can't even look at the graph before hating this early in the morning. Doucheyyyy
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:59:24
Find a private seller. Craigslist etc.
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:22:00
Fees are too high at coinbase to make any $ doing this unless you are working with multiple BTC. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:36:57
I lose .3btc every time i trade lol 
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:13:51
What about 5 yrs ago? Dumbass meme
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:04:41
I wonder how many BTC he had..?

It is highly illegal and if you get caught a fire-breathing dragon with a bbc wears a condom made of sandpaper and sticks it to you for 5 years.
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:29:30
Unironically I bought more right before the dip lol

Once you've done it all.... 
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:05:40
Don't be a pussy, jesus.. accept the bitcoin and sell it for double the price in 3 months.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:36:43
Its worth 1 BTC +1 BCH + novelty.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:48:51
Honestly.  Never worried about it. Unless you're buying insane amounts it'll never be looked at.
