Alright, upon agreement we will reply to some general questions regarding the general system architecture but we won't reply to technical details. We suggest a list of questions to be created and posted publicly on this subreddit. If this could work why not try. We will otherwise purse other ways of getting the boards manufactured but probably will be forced to not releasing them to the public now.

Isn't 500 Mhash\s fast enough? Price point will be probably lower than 200 USD for each ASIC board.
@_date: 2011-07-26 00:28:10
Nice, we'll be following this closely!
@_date: 2011-07-17 21:33:58
If we asked for 200 dollars instead of 15 btc as upfront cash to reserve your machine, would it have made any difference ?
@_date: 2011-07-24 01:50:05
How can you say we did not change anything else? The picture is blurred to avoid you seeing those changes.
@_date: 2011-07-23 22:26:12
Hello, got your donation and we're very thankful. We're sorry to hear that you lost confidence on our product, we will try to be more responsive in the future. About the man who sent 5 btc, we tried contacting him since we received the money, we will send it* back if requested.
@_date: 2011-07-24 02:14:40
It is also worth nothing that i have to wait 5 minutes for each reply i post, and now it incrementally added up to 9 minutes. Is this how reddit works?
Anyway i had just replied to your concern about credit card pre-orders.
The board itself has been slighty changed, the blurring does hide it well. 
If you had a strongest knowledge of how chinese factories, and therefore engineers, operate here you would have less prejudices against this project. They re-use as much components as possible as a business practice. 
@_date: 2011-07-24 02:24:54
Are you pointing out to the fact that there's a discrepancy between what we called 'a flash memory chip' and a sdram chip, in your opinion?
@_date: 2011-07-17 22:11:22
We can manage to meet with your team, email us your contact info at info and we will call you back. We are honestly concerned about reverse engineering issues and that's why we set the bar so high for getting a machine. 
@_date: 2011-07-17 21:31:19
Hey, thanks for your comment. Can you send engineers in Guangzhou or Shenzhen for a talk? 
@_date: 2011-07-23 22:16:53
We're online now. This tablet is assembled here in shenzhen, the cpu you are looking at is the VIA8505 and we used a similar raw pcb platform available cheaply here.

Total estimated power consumption will be around 5 W for each asic board, the cluster is intended to host a maximum of 10-12 boards, so the total power usage will depend on the number of boards installed. The main board will require around 25 W. For a full device, outputting about 6-8 Ghash\s, the power usage would be 5 W x 12 boards + 25 W, a total of about 85 W, plus the cooling system, the total might rise to about 100W. This is just an estimation. Full specifications will be available in the next few days.

To avoid any confusion : asicminer is the name of the custom software tool we developed, we have yet to decide a name for the cluster hardware miner based on specialized asics that we are about to start producing. The asicminer software tool, which modifies the normal mining process quite heavily, is designed to use the huge raw power of the asic boards cluster in the way explained on our blog post. By scanning fast the entire block at multiple given ranges it tries to find the solution faster than with a normal process. If it fails within a given period of time, it will pass the task to a mining pool.
* EDIT :
We also noticed that it is NOT clear from the headline that the mining cluster is running off the ASIC boards we developed  and not off GPUs
@_date: 2011-07-08 02:56:17
PCI compatible ? the mining device is a small cluster of up to 10-12 asic boards, with an oil cooling system and it communicates with the computer attached via usb.
@_date: 2011-07-17 22:09:09
The pcb is a 4-layered FR-4. We will publish some screenshots of the tools shortly on our blog, thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2011-07-17 21:30:01
Thanks for your comment. Sorry but we do not plan to release our design to the public. About the fabrication process : the pcb are printed using the silk screen method,IC and components mounted via SMT.
@_date: 2011-07-08 02:53:20
Power consumption will be fairly low, nothing compared to PC+GPU. Detailed specifications coming in the next few days.
@_date: 2011-07-08 03:01:09
So far thanks for all the suggestions/opinions! you guys rock!
@_date: 2011-07-24 03:05:37

Because the 5 btc are not even part of the sum you are paying for the order. Also we have to setup a bank account and paypal for this. The bank account is simple in China, paypal is not. This might require some time. Anyway, i think what we propose is not totally nuts, you will still be able to run a chargeback if you are not happy with your device via paypal. Are you concerned about those 5btc?
@_date: 2011-07-12 14:16:52
We developed a custom ASIC for bitcoin mining and will release official specifications very soon, including power usage / generated coin ratio and everything else. Sorry to hear you don't like the concept and article. Feedback taken
@_date: 2011-07-25 00:13:05
Ok fine. 
Edit : But wait, you mean you want your 1.20 btc donation back?
Re-Edit : Confused you with another customer.Sorry
@_date: 2011-07-17 21:14:01
We understand that it might look shady,but this is definitely not a SCAM. We won't publish pictures or schematics but we will reply to all your questions here.
@_date: 2011-07-24 04:38:56
Re-read that part of the discussion. You did not get the point. The SDRAM or flash RAM is used as a component of the ASIC board. Here some references :
Use of Block RAM (BRAM) for storage of constants [8]. Reconfigurable hardware devices 
such as FPGAs often have on-board memories which can be pre-loaded. 
Storing the Kt constants in these memories frees up space in the device 
which can then be used to implement extra logic. The free space also leads to
improved routing and, thus, a general speed-up in circuit operation.

We updated our blog post as per your (Bitcoin community) response.

The picture is of the ASIC board itself, the sdram is visible ON IT.
@_date: 2011-07-24 02:45:01
Well yes, it is in fact a SDRAM chip and it is an important part of our design.
@_date: 2011-07-23 23:47:19
We will ship boards with an unremovable epoxy coating.
@_date: 2011-07-17 21:55:24
We wouldn't release a pin-out diagram of the whole device. Only that could give you some peace of mind. 
@_date: 2011-07-24 04:59:36
I will tell you something of value:
It's undoubtful that some people nailed some important points, but the community did not call this unanimously a scam, before your crazy intervention we were trying to setup a separate discussion for some question asking. Now i understand you think i am a scammer but I either don't know who are you and who entitled you to speak for the community, and from what i see, you are not the kind of person that surely should take the lead in this kind of situations. Put away your ego, go to bed and sleep on this.Try not to be rude when answering to this msg. Going away now.back in some hours.
@_date: 2011-07-08 04:05:20
About 500 Mhash/s for each child board. 
@_date: 2011-07-24 01:38:19
How can you say that ? the raw pcb is exactely the same, we work with guys from several small factories here in Shenzhen and purchase components from them, but the board is modified to work with another IC and not the WM8505, the flash chip is the same by ELPIDA 
@_date: 2011-07-25 17:01:12
we got the EPP code for the domain transfer!
@_date: 2011-07-18 01:36:35
Thanks, we will get in touch soon.
@_date: 2011-07-25 01:46:27
Ok, i have checked the exoware.net control panel but i see no option for domain transfer. Support emailed.
@_date: 2011-07-12 14:12:28
Thanks for your comment. We are not conventionally mixing the two things. We use a different approach to mining, our tool only gives the block solution a lot of trials, if it does not find the solution in a given time it will just give up and download a new block, the old block will be passed to our hardware pool with a special payload. 
@_date: 2011-07-23 23:49:17
a full device with 10 boards uses about 300W of power.

We're currently about to close the sale of a whole first batch of devices to a private investor. We will be required not to duplicate the device for at least 3 years. Sorry guys. We will eventually refund all the people who sent the 5 btc within 48 hours.
@_date: 2011-07-24 04:08:44
EDIT : Ok, no personal opinion, offenses
*Those are consistent points :
Show us better photo proof as well as video proof of the ASIC in action. 
Show us everything you can without "compromising" your design. 
Have a detailed talk with JoelKatz (a respected and technically versed member of the Bitcoin community). 
Anyway If the community wants us to just change direction and completely stop providing updates just let us know. We will be back later this evening ( in China ) and checkout new comments.

We will give away the domain asicminer.net for free to who will request it with the most solid reason. It gets about 100 visits/day from google searches related to bitcoin asic and asic miner.

Have you ever been there to register a company? the answer is clearly no. Otherwise you would know that when you setup an offshore company there your address will be shared with multiple companies and those shared offices are located in the center of the city. Nathan road is full of this kind of business.
@_date: 2011-07-17 21:58:02
Well, we must agree with everybody that without further proof this might look shady
@_date: 2011-07-24 01:27:34
We already burned a good amount of cash in getting the project to this point and still require a serious amount upfront to start the production. Our main concern is that the product will be reverse engineered and copied within a short time-frame. We do know this because of the design itself. We used components available everywhere here in Shenzhen (this city has the biggest electronic components market worldwide). We based our work on several papers available online with a simple google search, and expanded from there. So the concern is to getting totally screwed on this project, that's why we require 5 btc upfront.
@_date: 2011-07-23 23:36:43
We used the term ASIC in a wrong fashion in first place. the thing is more akin* to a custom fpga actually.
@_date: 2011-07-08 02:56:56
At the moment this is a commercial venture, so opensource is not on our roadmap, but documentation will be good.
@_date: 2011-07-08 02:57:39
Thanks, We will setup a mailing list tomorrow.
@_date: 2011-07-24 03:25:59
How we plan to do them is by selling the entire lot to a single buyer interested in then purchasing many more machines for the purpose of running a huge mining rig. We already received such a proposal. Haven't investigated yet about it.
@_date: 2011-07-18 01:33:33

Give this guy  some more time and he will also find the papers we mentioned as inspiration. 
@_date: 2011-07-23 22:34:35
The reason we blurred it is because we know that the design can be easily cloned. We live in china since a long time so we developed a fear for this.
@_date: 2011-07-23 23:39:51
We never thought it would be so hard to be taken seriously. we're just trying to protect our hard-earned findings and already stated that we will use paypal/credit cards. We're 100% sure that is not safe to release pictures of the PCB due to its design itself.
@_date: 2011-07-17 21:32:10
We are not even thinking about manipulating votes, what's the point ?
@_date: 2011-07-12 14:04:18
Thanks for your comment. Your sarcasm is not helping here. Probably you did not get the concept right because of wrong terminology. With ranges, we mean points of start and end inside the block, see here for a good explanation of what a block is
