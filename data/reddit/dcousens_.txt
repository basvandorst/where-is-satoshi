Actually,  [there is]( a standard layout for BIP32.
[Pictures are a thousand words](
This `m/i'/a/k` layout is in use by [many]( different wallets,  such as Android's "Bitcoin Wallet", Breadwallet,  EI8HT,  Hive and even Multibit HD.

I am currently assisting [for fun,  FWIW] on the 3rd report for the OpenBitcoinPrivacyProject,  and,  while I don't have the 2nd report in front of me,  the fact that Bitcoin-Qt did not rate highly was probably related to its failures in on-chain privacy [as a default],  rather than anything related to its network privacy.
Ultimately we [the contributors who have engaged in these conversations to date] gauge an immutable public record to be of a higher privacy risk than your average network query [generally].
If you feel differently,  we are going to be doing the weightings for the threat model again soon,  so if you'd like to help, we would greatly appreciate your input!


Agreed,  but,  from an outside perspective [I imagine],  they are valid concerns.
I personally think the evolution of lightning networks will transform into an economically viable and private set of various topologies,  and I don't see this article in such a negative light.
Disclaimer:  Since it appears to matter,  I am a small block proponent,  love the work being done on LN,  and actively contribute to Bitcoin-Core where I can.

`bitcoinjs-lib` is **not** affected by [this bug]( (not to discredit the fact that this bug *does* exist in a library used by `bitcoinjs-lib`)
