"Multi-sig Hot wallet
Provided by BitGo (BitGo FAQ)
Only holds minimal amounts (~0.5% of customer funds)"
Wow...good catch.  WTF.

Very poor backpeddling.  That screen cap is shows your website and says nothing about it being non-BTC.

Yes on the first part.
Almost certainly no on the second part.

Here is an interview with him:

Surely this doesn't apply to those with open margin short positions, because they don't hold BTC at any time.   A margin BTCUSD short position only holds USD the entire time.  It buys BTC on the market later on to close the position.  And open short positions were only closed long after the hack because you decided to close them.  And even, then those who closed the short positions are not holding BTC.

Same for Bitcoin...speculation, store of value, and DNM.  That's pretty much it.

You are retarded. Trading on margin allows you to have less money on the exchange to risk.

I don't really know enough about it to comment that intelligently, but if they get the miners to fork it, and it has faster confirmations with lower fees, a lot of people will follow it.

Then I guess an altcoin is going to take over BTC a lot sooner than we all expected.  So it is BU instead of ETH...no big deal.

Coinbase is a FAIL on so many levels.  It would be funny if not for being so sad for so many of their customers and turning people off to Bitcoin.

Some are and some aren't, but you are better off controlling your private keys at all times, when possible.
