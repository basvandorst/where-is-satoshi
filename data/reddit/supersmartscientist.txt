All the Bitcoin ATMs I've seen were ATMs in name only; they're Bitcoin vending machines. You deposit USD for BTC, one way only.

Man, I feel awful for that guy. He had just about all of his money in there. That's going to take a while to get over, if ever.

I'm new to BTC, just got involved at the end of August. Even though I'm making  just small buys here and there (about $1k), the very first thing I did was buy a Ledger Nano S. Security first.

I bought mine before I bought any crypto. I don't fuck around with security; Ledger, complex passwords, 2FA on everything, separate emails for each account, always over VPN. I don't even own much tbh, but I'm sure as he'll keeping it mine.
