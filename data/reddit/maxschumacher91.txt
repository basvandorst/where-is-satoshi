Was my understanding that launching becomes cheaper through SpaceX and others.
This talk was a huge inspiration to me in this regard:

Yes, what exactly strikes you as absurd about this question?
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:30:43
Ok, too large distance certainly is a problem.
And you say there is no physical possibility to cool something in space even if there's no requirement to create and environment for humans (such as on the ISS). How do regular satellites do it then?
E.g. planet labs runs Ubuntu in space, how do they cover cooling?

Why would miners forgo transaction fees? Also, the "Scaling Bitcoin" conference literally just ended. The main concern is how to enable the Bitcoin network to handle load similar to that of Visa and others rather than the measly ~3.5 Tx/s that are possible now.
A common answer (that is already implemented in BitcoinXT) is to raise the Block-size limit above 1MB to enable more transactions per Block. 
Against this background an empty Block strikes me as quite an anomaly.

I agree with the basic premise of your question, adoption is not going as well as it could be but I don't think the economic questions you're raising are the main hindrances.


Could you please provide sources for this statement?
The block-size limit is not meaningless, it is a strong upper bound on the transaction volume the Bitcoin network can process. If this issue is not resolved confirmation times could increase dramatically, hindering adoption even more.
Wealth and money are not the same, if you double the amount of dollars in the world everything becomes twice as expensive, not twice as valuable.


Both? Users by paying transaction fees, "hoarders" by having their holdings inflated by the increased supply of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-13 00:34:46
yeah, but why? This cannot be intended by the protocol.

It strikes me as highly unlikely that mining node's mempools are literally empty.
Block propagation via node relays seldomly takes longer than 30 seconds, even to reach the most "distant" nodes in the network. The next Block came in 4 minutes later.
Transactions must have accrued in the meantime, especially considering that the next Block in the chain ( not only has 2400 transactions but is also extremely close to the 1MB limit (975kb).
"no transactions, no fees" doesn't cut it, something else must be going on here.

Great, thank you. The lower bound for transaction fees as implemented in Bitcoin-core plays a large role, you're right. I'm limiting myself to a timeframe in which versions 0.10 to 0.11.1 were active, so as to circumvent this interference.
The policies pools employ are very important, that's true. I really have to dig into how the prioritization process in the mempool works (I haven't found too much info on that issue yet).
As more inputs mean more bytes, small transactions with a lot of inputs (maybe a statistical relationship between transaction volume and number of inputs and thus corresponding byte-size can be established?) are of low priority and will take longer. Would be interesting to see how this affects confirmation times in periods of peak capacity.
Thanks for taking the time to help me out!

good point, another use-case. Machine transactions are a very exciting topic, maybe they classify as nanotransactions? I find Bitmesh to be very interesting:

Ah cool, thanks.
Taking the concept of Google Contributor (but cutting Google out), combining it with a powerful AdBlocker (e.g. uBlock) and basing it on Bitcoin is quite exciting, especially in times when 200m browsers have Adblockers installed and that number grows by 50% y-o-y. MIT's Tipsy is also similar: 
@_date: 2015-10-26 14:56:10
I agree, it is a restrictive definition but I'm afraid that's necessary to make empirical statements.
The mining reward is a huge factor, I agree. If halving of the reward significantly increases the cost of microtransactions (especially under high network load) that might be a consideration to discuss with the bitcoin-core development team.
Metering is nice and interesting (with large commercial applications in IoT, digital content streaming etc.) but not quite the same as a one-time transaction similar to one that would happen with cash (if you buy a cup of coffee with your smartphone you just want to pay once)

Yeah, Libbitcoin is also mentioned in "Mastering Bitcoin", I don't think it is actively mainted anymore though. API website is also down. ;/
My primary criterion really is the SQL database, so I can run large queries in a reasonable amount of time (statistical analysis and visualization will be done in R/RStudio). Mining, crypography and contracts are of lesser importance for this project.
The lightening network is really interesting I agree, I might include it in an outlook. Thank you!
