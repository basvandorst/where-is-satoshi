1. Does the article say anywhere that China is adopting bitcoin?
2. Do you understand that China being relevant to bitcoin doesn't mean bitcoin is relevant to China?
3. Do you actually consider "cryptocoinsnews.com" a reliable source of information?

So why don't we create a smaller quantity, the microCoin, where 1 Satoshi = 1,000,000 microCoin and then we make 1 cent = 1 microCoin? Then 1 Satoshi = 10,000 dollars! Wow, so much profit!

Then you'll need to pay two fees: miners and escrows. Actually you'll probably need to pay the miners fees twice because money will be passed to escrow and then to the vendor or back to you.

If you are proposing criminal activity (tax evasion) as a solution to the Greek people, you might as well propose that they start cooking meth to sell and make some extra cash.
Bitcoin being volatile as it is, cash in hand may be a much better option to evade taxes.
There are many other options to avoid a potential forced conversion to Drachmas, such as buying gold or opening a bank account in a neighbour country that also uses Euros.

1. Bitcoin doesn't necessarily gain in value. It has dropped in value a lot since late 2013.
2. The fact that other currencies, such as the Euro that is used in Greece, lose some value over time is pretty irrelevant. Just put your money on a savings account and you should be fine. If you are willing to take risks you can buy bonds, shares, gilts, etc.

@_date: 2015-05-21 17:45:02
Or maybe the reason why the price is low is because most people are just not interested. It's not like they like it, but believe they can't afford it. They simply don't like it.

Asset forfeiture is an important instrument the state has to fight crime. Being against the principle of asset forfeiture is like being against the idea of putting criminals in jail. I support the existence of jails and asset forfeiture. I think most people would support too.

You mean because the critics of bitcoin have been around with their arguments for a while, there is no point debating with them? You see, this argument also works both ways.

@_date: 2015-01-13 13:49:14
What people like you seem to have difficulty understanding is that you should never make the market, you should ride it (up or down). What are you trying to achieve? Buy so much that the price goes up? When it goes up who are you going to sell it to since you were the one buying in the first place? Even if you get a small group of people to go with you in a buying frenzy, will you sell your coins to them before they sell theirs to you?
I'm not sure I explained it well enough, just don't try to create something of values by buying it just to create something of value. Instead, if the price goes down, just accept that's the market value.
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:19:55
$100 per bitcoin is still retarded for the majority of people. That's why most people do not by bitcoins at all. Just because a small fraction of the population keep buying/selling bitcoin among themselves at a higher price (approx $280), that doesn't mean the majority of people still don't believe bitcoin is not even worth $100.

Even if this was true (which is not), providing ways to dodge the justice system is not a solution. That would be like providing ways for people to run away from jail. You are only reinforcing the idea the Bitcoin is only good for criminals.

Isn't it a very condescending argument? You are assuming by making some loose comparison between two completely different things (world wide web and blockchain) people will suddenly think the blockchain is a good idea.

Well, usually if I try to discuss in this sub why I think bitcoin is not a good idea I also get "lalala" kind of responses, so it goes both ways.

Why? It can be worth $600 in a year and $40 in two years and then $235 in three years... I'm saying it will probably be low volume and high volatility forever. With the low volume bitcoin has (and will probably always have because it's a niche) price swings happen for any reason (or no reason at all).
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:53:27
I see it very differently. Bitcoin is not all-or-nothing, bitcoin is a currency for those who are enthusiastic about it. It will stay around where it is now for decades to come. It's like Esperanto, the constructed language, it will never become the international language, but it will never die either, it will always be there for those who are enthusiastic about it.

Because they can use it to buy goods from the USA. The USA in turn value it because it's legal tender there (can pay taxes). If you are asking a more broad question as to why the dollar specifically is used almost as a world currency, that I don't know, but there is already a trend going on of the dollar losing this status and other currencies becoming more equal with the dollar.
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:35:18
Ah, the old bitcoin fallacy of creating analogies that don't really connect. Just like bitcoin is the same as the early internet, right?
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:42:12
No, it's a chain of interests that ends in the legal tender. They value it because some else will value it ultimately because it's legal tender in the USA.
It's like prisoners of war (I can't remember in which war that happened) that received some goods from the prison administration including food and cigarettes. They would then proceed to trade among themselves if they wanted something more than something else (like changing an apple for an orange or whatever), but quickly, for some reason, cigarettes became the default currency. Everything was traded for cigarettes. The consequence was that even non-smokers would accept cigarettes for their goods. Why if they don't smoke? Because someone else does. Going back to your question, why do drug dealers in Colombia value the dollar if they don't pay taxes in dollar? Because someone else does.

4. Exactly, it will die. 
5. Fuck you too.
@_date: 2015-11-05 11:04:27
Well, you are being downvoted because your advice is bullshit. If you bought at $500, the price now is $400, but it looks like it's going to $300, why wouldn't you sell it? Why keep something that is bound to devaluate? The advice should be: if you believe is going up, buy; if you believe is going down, sell. The price you bought is irrelevant, it's sunk cost.
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:16:38
I'm not aware of microtransaction being huge. As for mobile gaming (which I don't play), don't Apple or Google have some solution for it? Anyway, even if micropayment was really huge and there were no other solutions, I still don't think bitcoin is a good solution. The notion that bitcoin is cheap is a myth. It's been heavily paid by new coins. When mining reduces, fees will have to increase for miners to cover their cost.
@_date: 2015-03-24 15:08:42
1. I don't care about micro transactions. I never needed to buy a beer to someone who was in another country. I don't want to tip people on Reddit. I could go on...
2. Yes, can accept the money I chose to and I chose to accept money created by a democratically elected group of people, i.e., the government.
3. I didn't understand the part about hermit and kill myself. The guy called Drapper (or something like that) would become filthy rich for gambling.
4. What I'm trying to say is basically the transaction limit is extremely low and the power consumption is extremely high.
5. I never heard of any family or friend having their bank account forfeited. It's a possibility that is clearly not abused by the system (well, if you're dealing drugs and your account is blocked, don't act surprised). Being your own bank has horrible consequences as can be found in

Do you really have any doubts on what a debate is and that most people would consider what we are having here a debate?

@_date: 2015-03-24 11:15:05
I think your first point is that BTC enthusiasts should worry if BTC is mentioned positively but the price doesn't react, because that would imply no one cared about BTC anyway? If that's your point, I agree a BTC enthusiast should be worried about it (not me because, as I mentioned, I am not a BTC enthusiast). I just wanted to discuss the perception of BTC with technical people because this is a point I see brought up here quite often and discussing disagreements is always more constructive than reinforcing agreements (aka circlejerks are a waste of time).

I'm sure my reasons are the reasons of many other people, so you may have heard of them before, but here goes a few of them:
1. Bitcoin doesn't solve any problem. There has never been a moment in my life when having bitcoins would have made it easier. Maybe it's good for Africans, I don't know (being Brazilian I can guarantee you it doesn't solve any problem in Brazil).
2. Why should I accept money created by random people who were never chosen to do so by anyone (they are not like a democratically  elected government or anything)?
3. If bitcoin gets widespread support some people, who just happen to have gambled on it, will get many times richer than anyone else in history of mankind. I don't want to live in a society like that.
4. Technically speaking, bitcoin seems really not scalable and that looks like a pretty fundamental issues since it comes from proof of work which is one of the basis of the protocol. I'm not an expert here, though.
5. I want governments to have some level of control over the economy.
