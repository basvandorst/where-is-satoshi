You don't deserve anything you haven't earned. It's one thing to pose a question to an individual, another thing to post your question to the mob with expectation of an answer when the individual declines to answer it.

What's wrong with the latest version published on Github?

Using a lightweight wallet would be a reasonable answer if lightweight wallets weren't so bad at protecting your privacy. No one has really solved the challenge of how not to leak critical information to either trusted servers (accessible to jackbooted thugs by hack or subpoena) or bitcoin network peers that could be anyone including the jackbooted thugs themselves.
This is a weird way that scalability solutions and privacy are linked for Bitcoin.

I believe it does, which is why I am confused about why it ended up in your Inbox.

That's not the latest version on GitHub...

You're looking at the wrong branch in the repository:

Thanks for posting. I reported this to the admin for dh.net.ua.

You appear to be confused about what "force" means. It does not apply to bitcoin nodes.

If Case has one key, the user has one key, and 3rd Key Solutions has one key, who has custodianship? It's fuzzy. I expect regulators will try to pin the responsibility on Case to rope them into their jurisdictions, but I wish Case all the best in those legal challenges.

Average block size can be misleading due to blocks that only contain coinbase transactions to drag the average down. You won't see it reach 100% for we're effectively out of space.

Nice. Did you find a write-up somewhere on how to set this up?
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:30:08

I'd warmly encourage you, and others on the Core team to demonstrate your superior economic expertise or share which experts you gather advice from.
Overall, I see the Core team making extremely few economic arguments for their design choices, and answer very few challenges based on economic arguments.
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:22:14
I oppose tracking, black lists, breaking tor and want privacy and sensible choices around decentralization, but I'm not siding with Core.

hi luke

I abhor the idea of introducing voting into Bitcoin development -- this would be a centralizing influence, and not a decentralizing one. The socially constructed "consensus" approach is messy enough already.

Normal electrum-2.3.2.exe ([Detection ratio 0/56]( 
[Malicious file behavioral analysis](
It appears to ferret away files named psvss.exe and updserv.exe in a “Themes” directory, and then overwrite an existing Microsoft file called rsm.exe with the upserv.exe file. rsm.exe is associated with Windows’ Removable Storage Manager Command Line Interface. 
It performs these DNS lookups that are NOT made by the normal Electrum executable:
* EAST.electrum.jdubya.info
* electrum.no-ip.org
* erbium1.sytes.net
* electrum0.electricnewyear.net
* WEST.electrum.jdubya.info
* kirsche.emzy.de
* headers.electrum.org (presumably benign)

This is really cool!
Just to clear up a little potential confusion: SharedCoin (or "Shared Coin" with a space) is Blockchain.info's CoinJoin-based, centralized mixer. "Shared Send" was an old centralized mixing service also run by Blockchain.info, which was deprecated a long time ago when SharedCoin came out. The latter was a first-gen mixing service that was vulnerable to theft and relied on off-chain accounting to provide privacy.
