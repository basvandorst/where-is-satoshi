Well, there are still consumer laws (I am assuming here here that his account is a consumer account, and not a business account), which defines and prevents businesses from doing only what they want, so he might still have a legal recourse against that - to be verified.
It's not because it is written in the "Terms and Conditions" that it would pass the test of a judge in the Small Claims Court.  This is Bitcoin, yes, but this is also a company operating in Canada.
That being said, indeed, that 4% fee is ridiculous!

We can then conclude that Tom Clancy is the real Satoshi Nakamoto!
Breaking news!

I also thought of that.  It almost sounded like a half-broken/half-crazy A.I. program.
Breaking news:  Bitcoin created by A.I. that later malfunctioned!
What a great movie plot.  ;)

That is very true, however, in my understanding, companies that conduct business in Canada are indeed subject to Canadian consumer laws, and can then be sued if they do not respect them.  (They can write whatever they want in their Terms and conditions, that doesn't automatically make it legally true!)  After a judgement is made against a company, then the next step is to have this judgement recognized in the location where the business is registered or has assets, and this is only a formality for most Westernized countries.  (For Bulgaria, I would think that would indeed be more difficult - nothing against Bulgaria, but the language, systems, etc. are rather different than the US &amp; Canada.)
In the case of CAVirtex, since they are able to accept Interac transfers as well as other local methods of payment (if I am not wrong), they certainly must have a presence here in Canada.
In a country with rule of law, it can sometimes be surprising what someone can achieve when being patient (and stubborn) with the legal proceedings.  I've see big telecom companies being forced to pay/refund the few hundred dollars they charged illegally to customers whom had the patience to go through all these proceedings.

The difference might be, this time, that it is not an unrelated innocent victim being assailed by the media and the world.  It's someone whom, it seems, forged evidence in the very specific intent to be assaulted by media and the world.  He doesn't need help from Satoshi to get him out of the place where he put himself in.  ;)

Yes, but its written "World population" in the top-left corner of their screen on the video.  So they were looking at   , not at a supposedly "internal monitoring system".

You mean the BTC Manager?
@_date: 2015-07-09 03:37:38
Yes, but we're running a p2p decentralized system here - with the pros &amp; cons that comes with it.
One of the many differences is that there will never be a moment where "some big guy" from the management will pull the plug to the entire system, because the Company has been bought by another Company (and you've just learnt that you lost your job), or the "strategic orientations" of the Company have changed, they are now going into [whatever other thing] and ditching this great cloud you worked all your heart and sweat to maintain, etc.
Bitcoin's network simply cannot be shut down.
So there are some disadvantages to that, too.  ;)

Without wanting to undermine the rest of the article, reading someone write about the "second Bitcoin bubble" shows how new (or non-knowledgeable) they actually are to Bitcoin.  And so it unfortunately adds doubts to the thoroughness of their analysis.
I am not saying that ZH's analysis or ideas aren't valid nor interesting.  But, ZH looks as if they don't know much about Bitcoin if they haven't heard at all about Bitcoin's previous bubbles!
Bitcoin bubbles:
Note:  These might be slightly (or strongly) inaccurate.  But you get the idea.
[700% jump in a month (6 cents to 50 cents)](
[150% jump in a month (40 cents to $1.00)](
[5000% jump in 2 months (56 cents to $32)](
[2500% jump in 4 months ($10 to $256)](
[900% jump in 2 months ($120 to $1200)](
