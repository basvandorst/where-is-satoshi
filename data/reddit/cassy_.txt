I somewhat understand that. As I said I was able to get verified on paypal. Does the government just have strong regulations against Bitcoin?

We don't say that word here.

I remember a post asking one of the organizers about this. If the conference where to have live streaming, the cost to rent the venue would be a whole lot more. So we just have to wait till the conference is over.

Does coinbase do a simular thing?

I don't get their buisness model. How do they generate the capital for payouts?
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:16:00
Lol, then they still wouldn't make any money.

I'm interested, but I'd like to know what bank would back this card. The FAQ just says "our partner bank" and I feel like no bank would go anywhere near this card.

Has this happened in the past?

What about the g2a "selected offer"?
