Finaninspektionen (FI), which is the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, warns that the virtual currency bitcoin opens possibilities for anonymous payments and therefore can be used for money laundering, writes nliv.se.
The currency has gained a powerful boost by banks in Cyprus in a crisis, especially as Cypriot investors who had money in the bank on the island had to fork out.
Requires registration
Due to the risk of money laundering, the Swedish audit companies that sell or buy Bitcoins must register writes Aftenposten.no.
The requirement for registration was introduced in the autumn of 2012, according to Secretary Karin Boman Roding in FI Press.
- When a financial institution. This means that they are responsible for preventing money laundering exploited, she told the Swedish newspaper.
Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway stressed that Bitcoins are not subject to supervision or regulation of payment, because it is a virtual currency.
- Finance Authority is aware that there is a debate at EU level on the possible regulation of Bitcoins and other virtual currencies, and following this trend. It also notes that the Swedish Financial has introduced a duty for buying and selling Bitcoins, writes the consumer coordinator Nikolay Anders Kvam in Finance Authority in an email to Aftenposten.
Consumer Council warns
- It sounds like an exciting and easy anarchist project, but also unstable and risky. I'm not putting my money on this, says technical director Jorge Jensen of the Consumer Council.
He believes that the anonymity of the player or players behind bitcoin makes the system vulnerable.
- If bakpersonene choose to flood the system with numbers, values ​​disappear. It can also happen when hackers managed to penetrate the system, says Jensen.
And anonymity, criminals can exploit the system, so they use cash, because they are less detectable.
- In general, it is considered that Finance anonymous payment as Bitcoins relatively high risk of money laundering carries, writing Finance Authority.
Jensen expects that in line with the development of the network will be more new payment.
- From the first monetary systems have been developed, it has been considered essential to all known format, king or emperor, after the payment as a deposit for the value and quality of the coin. Bitcoin is exactly the opposite.
Continuation rocket mission
Svenska Dagbladet writes that the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, not on bitcoin as a threat to the financial system, but there is a risk for people who buy or invest in the currency.
Besides a huge risk when it comes to the possibility of buying and selling of currencies, so the risk is greater because of that bitcoin has increased enormously in value in the past.
Last year, prices for the virtual currency of around $ 10 per unit. In recent weeks, the price skyrocketed, and the beginning of April, Aftenposten wrote that the exchange rate was doubled in a few weeks and about to be a bubble. then the share price was almost $ 150.
But the journey to heaven we have known, because now smells bitcoin at $ 250. That is an increase of about $ 100 on a short week.
There are only a few sites that accept bitcoin as currency, but speculation in the currency is fierce among the tens of thousands of people in different trading places on the web. Tokyo-based Mt Gox advertising is by standing for 80 percent of trade in bitcoin.
