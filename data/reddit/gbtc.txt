Are you ready to fill the void after BitMit?
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:07:46
Oh, I didn't realize this was six days ago.

You don't support trademark law? If you buy a part for your car that says "genuine [your car brand]", don't you want to be pretty sure it's true?

Where do you get that R3 UNO for $14.50 shipped?
@_date: 2012-09-29 14:54:40
The Hobbyking one isn't in stock, and shipping isn't included in their price.
DX actually is cheaper than I am, but they take 7-10 days just to get the order in the mail. My supplier will have the parcel in the mail within 24 hours, most of the time. So yeah, I think it's fair for me to charge a little extra for a faster service.
@_date: 2012-09-27 18:32:31
For how much? And if you don't live very close to that vending machine, I guess the travel expenses to get there will be larger than the shipping cost I charge (0, free shipping).
@_date: 2012-10-17 19:06:01
If you want to spend your coins, you should try [**Bitmit**](
@_date: 2012-09-29 14:55:34
So, how much is an Arduino board from that vending machine? I'm not asking to make a point, I'm just curious.
@_date: 2012-09-27 19:22:14
OK. Good for you. In the rest of the world, Arduino vending machines aren't really an option.
I'm still curious though, how much is an Uno board from that machine?
@_date: 2012-09-27 18:09:36
You are right, that price was a bit too high. I've lowered it. It's not as low as two dollars, but at least you pay less for one than for two. Please keep in mind that I don't charge for shipping.
@_date: 2012-09-27 18:07:30
Sorry for that, English isn't my first language.
@_date: 2012-09-27 18:30:34
Please point me to where you can get that Uno board for a lower price in fiat. I've lowered the price quite a bit.
@_date: 2012-09-29 19:55:17
That's without the USB cable though. Seriously, sure, you can pretty much always find something a few percent cheaper on eBay. That doesn't mean my business is pointless.
@_date: 2012-09-27 18:18:28
1. That item is not in stock, it can't be bought for that price.
2. Shipping is not included in the price.
3. "This is not an original Arduino brand product, it is manufactured with the same components and functionality by a different manufacturer." In other words, it's a clone and shouldn't be carrying the Arduino trademark. That's actually illegal. I'm also selling (legal) clones, but I'm not comitting trademark infringements.
4. I've lowered my price quite a bit. My price in USD is now lower than Hobbyking's, if you add the 2.99 they charge for shipping.
@_date: 2012-05-31 10:46:01
As a merchant, this makes me nervous. If I accept a payment from someone who has accepted money from the hacker, will I be in trouble?
@_date: 2012-09-27 18:29:32
I don't agree. When more things are offered for Bitcoins, the Bitcoin economy grows stronger, since there's less incentive to sell the Bitcoins back for fiat currency. If you pay some web developer for his services in Bitcoins, he uses them for buying and Arduino board from me and I use them to buy something from you, the fiat currencies are completely out of the loop. That's a good thing.
There are other ways to obtain Bitcoins than to buy them for fiat. You can sell your own stuff on Bitmit to get them, or you can mine them. Not having to sell your mined coins for fiat before you can use the money also has a value.
By the way, I've lowered some of my prices. Which ones are still too high, in your mind? The original prices were set to be a fair bit lower than the big online vendors like Sparkfun and Makershed. Do you also think that those stores don't add any value to the USD economy?
Some other things about Bitcoin are the very low fees and the ease of international transfers involved. Had it not been for Bitcoin, I would have a hard time selling these things to people outside of Europe, even outside my own country.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:42:41
So, what are you doing better than Bitmit or Coingig, besides being British?
I sell [a lot of stuff over at Bitmit]( Some of the stuff I sell are actually available in my supplier's UK warehouse, so I could do some listings with you as well. However, I think you need to tell me what I would benefit from listing with you.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:32:24
Honest companies don't offer outrageous, unfair contracts.
EDIT: As stated below, it seems that the 30-50% fee to Robocoin is a part of the transaction fee the user pays for using the ATM, not counted from the whole transaction. That makes the terms pretty OK.

How? What actions are you taking? What features do you have that your competitors lack?

Maybe there's a lot off communication going on between the Subway franchise takers? They might have their own mailing list, web forum or such. If one or two bitcoin success stories and/or howto:s was posted there, I'm sure others would want to try it out.
Also, Subway is the worlds largest food chain. There are more Subway restaurants than there are McDonald's.

I don't stock Raspberry Pi's, but an Arduino + Ethernet shield + 1602 shield will do the trick as well. I have all those parts for sale on Bitmit:
  
  
If you order all three, I'll take 0.01 BTC off. Just write a message with the order, reminding me of the discount. Offer good for 24 hours.
**EDIT:** There might be some compatibility issues with using the LCD and ethernet shields together. There [are]( [workarounds]( to this problem, but if you want to be extra sure you can use an ethernet module and a standalone 1602 LCD instead of shields:
  
  
If you want a larger display, you can use a 2004 LCD:

@_date: 2013-04-19 13:57:58
Well, thank you. I try to keep my prices low. I can't imagine what kind of margins Sparkfun must be taking in. On the other hand, they also have a lot of overhead. Anyway, I have lots of more Arduinos and peripherals listed on Bitmit:   
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:00:45
I hope you enjoy it :)

Don't they add a percentage on the exchange rate?
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:33:41
Nah, the previous owner did sell the site. The name "tosaki" has changed hands at least twice, and so has Bitmit.
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:00:53
Never fear, you can do the same thing with an Arduino for ~0.33 BTC

I have a kit, built around an Arduino. See my comment here:

Is "l.e." short for Egyptian Pounds? If so, isn't the price of one of your T-shirts pretty much what the average Egyptian earns in a month?
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:53:37
It will stay partly paid, and that's OK. I will ship your order as usual, and you will release the partial payment as usual.

I would wait until Sunday evening, if you can get to buying that fast. There's a dip going on right now. Wait  til it bottoms out.
This is not financial advice, do with it what you want.
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:40:44
There will be a dip, but don't let it scare you. Last week, we bounced back just fine! Hold your coins, don't panic.

What's with all the poo-slinging? Tell us what he's doing to/with/for bitcoin and why it's bad. I'm not interested in his personal affairs.

I just got the idea that I'd gift a month of Reddit gold to any redditor spending a certain amount of USD buying things from me on Bitmit. I could combina that campaign with the one you are proposing. That way, even redditors who don't want to "pay for" reddit gold could get it in May.
Good idea?
