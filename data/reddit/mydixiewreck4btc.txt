Nice.  Shifting the goal post to claim bitcoin is zero sum (also known as ponzi scheme).
Fluctuations in bitcoins market cap equate to a net gain or loss among all bitcoin holders.
For bitcoin to be a zero sum game, there would have to be a central authority that is in control of the funds.  As bitcoins market cap increases, this central authority takes the units and "cashes out", effectively making the ponzi operator the winner while the rest lose.

Miners (and pool operators) have to run full nodes.  Miners have an incentive to meet the demands of the bitcoin system.
If that demand is not being met, bitcoins use case starts to diminish, hurting miner revenue.

With this OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY would someone be able to do the following:
* Buy Bitcoin
* Transfer Bitcoin to Address X.
* Use private key of Address X to sign a transaction moving coins into a OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY transaction, lets say hold coins for 1 month.  This transaction was signed offline, and never broadcast.
* Destroy private key to Address X.
* Store signed transaction in safe place.
* Store private keys to receiving OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY address(es) in safe place.
If someone were to find the signed transaction, the only thing they could do is broadcast it to the network, where it will move the coins to a OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY state, effectively holding the coins there for 1 month.
The downside would be if someone found the private keys to the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY address(es).
Bonus: Store the transaction in a wearable smart watch that monitors heart beat.  If heart beat stops, broadcast transaction to the network.  Futuristic dead mans switch.

In a prisoners dilemma, the parties are separated and not able to communicate.  Miners are able to communicate.  Miners know if the system is not living up to the demand, their investments will be threatened.
In tragedy of the commons, the parties are depleting a common resource to serve their self interests.  Miners do not deplete block size to hash.


Not following you on that one.
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:10:08


Supply and demand.  Blocksize debate is actively being discussed to increase supply (block space) as demand (transactions) is increasing.  My argument would be that there is a tipping point.  If that tipping point is reached (transactions disappearing from mem pool due to high demand and limited block space) bitcoin's utility will decrease.  Along with disappearing transactions, fees will increase to an unreasonable rate for the end users.  As transaction fees increase and hit a certain point, the bitcoin system will no longer be feasible for the end users.  At that point, the size of the bitcoin economy is stagnant or begins to decrease.


In the tragedy of the commons, the scarce resource is common.  Bandwidth/processing power/storage isn't a common resource among all users.  Those are endpoint resources.  As the requirements of  bandwidth/processing power/storage increase, less resourceful end users attempting to run a full validating node will be knocked out.  This is why most end users have switched to thin clients, hosted wallets, etc.  The problem here isn't a depletion of resources, but centralization.  Which leads into a whole other argument.

Most exchanges trade between fiat and btc, meaning fiat holders are the losers when btc increases.  Bitcoin is tiny compared to most fiat currencies, so the effect on fiat is really small, not even making a dent, while the effect on btc is large (1 to 1200 USD).
Think of it as the amazon river (fiat) leaking some water into a small pond (btc).  You wouldn't notice a drop missing from the amazon, but that pond went from nothing to something you can swim in.

This is how I look at it.
If Mark stole the money, I would call it embezzlement.


If MtGox was truly robbed of their funds, to me it was just a pure simple robbery.
If Mark lost the private keys, he's a fucking dumbass.
But, given all of the possible situations I've heard, I still don't see how it falls under a Ponzi scheme giving the definition:


EDIT: Unless MtGox rigged their order books.  In this case, it would be getting closer to a ponzi.  "Hey, look at our exchange, we offer coins at a different rate, come in a buy... you'll make more money here".

All comes down to their books and if they are balanced.
In a properly ran exchange, when it starts off, order books are empty.  No fiat, no BTC.
* Alice deposits $100 USD.
* Bob deposits 1 BTC.
* Alice creates order for 1 BTC @ $100.
* Bob does the same.
* Order is executed.
* Alice now has 1 BTC, Bob has $100.
* They can now withdrawal.
The problem comes when the books are not balanced.  If Mt.Gox lost the coins, stole the coins, etc... this is why they failed.  The point after losing the coins, they were operating as a fractional reserve, bank run begins, and they can't pay everyone off.  If their books were balanced, and had the assets they claimed to have, they could pay everyone off.
Now if Mt.Gox was fixing the order books from the beginning, then yes, it was a scam.

When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not satisfy her owner, he must allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. But if the slave’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave but as a daughter.
If a man who has married a slave wife takes another wife for himself, he must not neglect the rights of the first wife to food, clothing, and sexual intimacy.  If he fails in any of these three obligations, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment in bitcoin.

No, this is a graph of Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain.  This graph does not show how many people are using a broker.

That's why I refrained from using the term "banking" and used "system" instead.  There might be a better term that applies to an exchange.
MtGox was just a middle man between buyers and sellers, and somehow lost their assets all while continuing to operate as an exchange until too many people started to withdrawal.

Blockchain.info supposedly cannot see your addresses/private keys, and they supposedly don't store your credentials.
With that said, it's plausible this is legit, but I'd wait for confirmation from a blockchain.info representative.  If they do confirm this email is legit, I would drain any remaining funds from the compromised wallet to a new wallet before sending them the credentials.  And never use the compromised wallet or any addresses in it again. (EDIT: I just saw they say the same thing).

The first one I checked, the 79k  on your list.  That address is not "active' as of 2014.  The coins were sent there 2011-03-01 10:26:19, and none have moved since then.  There are several dust transactions and messages being sent the the address, but never any coins being spent.  That does not prove Mt.Gox still has access to the private keys, that proves the Bitcoin network is still functioning (allowing coins to be sent to that address).
Edit: Just checked the rest, same situation.

People 'round here joke about going to the moon, mostly due to the price increases.  In reality, Bitcoin is slowing growing over time, which is a good thing as the technology behind it needs to keep up.  If Bitcoin replaced Visa/Mastercard payment networks tomorrow, it would fail.


USD Volume:
Bitcoin Volume:
In an inflating currency, over time, volume will increase.  In 1950 $1 could buy a loaf of bread.  In 2000, $4 buys a loaf of bread.  Transaction volume increased assuming the same number of loafs of bread are being purchased.
In a deflating currency, over time, volume will decrease. In 2010 0.01BTC could buy a loaf of bread.  In 2015 0.0001BTC buys a loaf of bread.  Transaction volume decreased assuming the same number of loafs of bread are being purchased.

Everyone will tell you, no it's not, but this is what I did:  Instead of looking at ROI figures, I looked at how much I wanted to invest and how much power consumption would cost.
I decided to purchase enough equipment to draw $100 worth of power each month, and just let it ride.  I held all of the coins and paid the $100/month from fiat.
At the time of investment, all of the mining calculators said I'd never make a ROI.  I didn't care, I wanted to mine.
Turns out the miners did make a positive ROI.

If you look at it from the perspective of Zuckerberg just wanting a piece of the pie, then yeah.
But if you look at it from the perspective as a competition between Zuckerberg and the Winklevii, the Winklevii have purchased X amount of coins at what I have to assume to be a lower price than BTC is currently trading at.  This means the Winklevii's ROI will always be higher than what ever Zuckerberg purchases at (as long as the price stays higher than a certain threshold and the Winklevii don't sell).

Here's the popular addresses they are excluding: 
You'll see most are used as a game, people send coin to an address, owner of that address performs some type of action (usually dice roll) and either sends back dust (small amount of coin) or your original bet + any profits.  So for charting purposes, they exclude these addresses to give a better idea as to how many legitimate transactions are occurring.

"Take an additional 2% off your entire order by purchasing with Bitcoin!"
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:49:18
I believe you're a little confused.  Coins don't "die".  Private keys can be lost, but those coins are not dead.  They can be spent... if someone finds the private key.  There isn't a way to determine how many private keys are truly lost, hence why the market cap always uses total mined coins.
Bitcoin days destroyed is a whole other subject, and has nothing to do with lost private keys.  Explaining by example: Lets say I purchased 1 BTC a year ago and moved it to an address.  Today, I decide to move that 1 BTC to another address.  1 BTC * 365 days = 365 bitcoin days destroyed.
So when you're looking at the BTC days destroyed chart, you're looking at how many coins have been moved multiplied by how long they've been sitting dormant.

No doubt people are using Bitcoin as a speculative invest vehicle, and that's what you're speaking of.  This is due to the positive feedback loop, deflationary nature, and how new this technology is in general.  Specifically, the people you speak of are in it for short term gains.
We have seen volatility go down as more people come on board, Bitcoin is becoming more of a currency each day (slowly), although it's not currently very useful as a currency due to the volatility.  If you're in the game long enough, you'll start to see these trends.  Volatility down, currency/store of value up.

When you deposited those 200BTC to a MtGox address, they were likely used to pay someone else off who was trying to withdraw.  Sadly, your "account" is just an entry in MtGox's database, and the whole exchange appears to have been operating as a fractional reserve system.

Nah, been in this game for a while.  I've stopped focusing on the exchange rates.  If the value of 1 BTC = $500 and stayed there, rock solid, I'd still be happy.

Off the top of my head, I believe transactions are removed from the mem pool after so long, and have to be retransmitted by the originating client.
So transactions will not "literally always be confirmed".  They have to be retransmitted and HOPE they get confirmed.

Hard drive density is measured in bits per square inch, the highest of which are currently (5/2013) 750 gigabits per square inch. This means that a gigabyte of data will take up about 6.88 millimeter2. The weight of an area of a platter consists of the substrate (usually glass and ceramic) and the magnetic layer which actually holds the magnetic grains storing the data. The magnetic layer is usually made of a mostly cobalt alloy of 10-20 nm thickness. Assuming 10nm thickness to make the math easier, This gives us about 6.88 * 1013 nm3 of magnetic layer material for one gigabyte.
Given the density of cobalt, this means that we can approximate the weight at 0.612471 micrograms per gigabyte.

No one gave a shit about the Internet back in the 80/90s.  No one cared about how it worked or operated.  Mainstream laughed at it, called people who used it nerds.  Then people started to realize how easy and efficient the Internet was for the flow of information.
Bitcoin is set for doing the same for the flow of money, property, assets, contracts, and any other "apps" where a decentralized trust-less medium shakes the foundations of our current centralized systems.  We're in the no one gives a shit how it works phase.

When person A sends bitcoin to person B, the transaction is broadcast worldwide via the Bitcoin protocol.  This is what the chart is showing.  From this data, we have no idea what the transaction was for, we only know that bitcoin moved.  Think of it as Gold moving from one location to another.  So if I have Gold, and I mail a piece of it to you, that has no affect on the market price of Gold.

Does Bitcoin swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you Satoshi?
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:33:23
I have no clue, but I can speculate.  Just by moving those coins, the market would crash, in fear of saturation and/or uncertainty.  If Satoshi is everything he/she/they seems to be on the surface, those private keys were destroyed.  But I am prepared, as I hope everyone else who invests keeps this in the back of their mind.  I hope Bitcoin succeeds, but I fear long term (10+ years), another cryptocurrency will emerge and take over.  Overall, I'm bullish on BTC.

Yes it would have been possible.  It would have been a manual process in 2011, no bitcoin wallets existed that supported it.  It didn't become popular until recently in the Bitcoin community.  Back then most people didn't even encrypt wallets (they weren't as valuable as they are today).

You exchanged dollars ($) for BTC when the price was &lt;$1.  If you were to sell at an exchange rate of &gt;$1, you realized a gain in dollars ($).  Most people claim dollars ($) are money.  In that case, then yes, you "made money".

A Bitcoin transaction can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs.
The reference Bitcoin wallet, Bitcoin QT, has a 'coin control' feature that lets you select which inputs you want to spend from.  I can't recall off the top of my head if there is a way to specify multiple outputs.  I'm not sure about other wallet implementations.  If you know how to code, you could use the reference Bitcoin wallet and RPC commands to generate your own transactions.

It's a simplistic view.  Is it technically correct?  Yes.  Anyone can go to  and make an altcoin.
Building a network to support said altcoin is the issue.  Given any thought, one would quickly realize that Bitcoin has the [first mover advantage]( and a huge network backing it.
An altcoin small enough that a $100 GPU could attack the ledger, probably wouldn't work so well.  OP probably hasn't thought that deep though.

I agree with you.
My original post was short, snappy, and in your face slam to the commenter.  I frequently choose these types of responses of for a few reasons.
I was a huge skeptic when I first got in to Bitcoin.  What ultimately broke my mental walls were these types of responses.  Those types of responses made me mad.  They made me question everything I knew, and ultimately opened up my mind to new ideas.
Some people may see me as an asshole, but I don't care.  My only hopes are to break other people's mental bubbles, just as mine were broken.

Yup, and its really easy to do.  Using bitcoin core's RPC calls and a few lines of code.  I've done this on testnet several times playing around.  I believe I was generating about 1,000 transactions a minute using one node.
Of course having all of these transactions included in the blockchain will cost you in terms of fees.  I didn't do any testing to see much of an impact it would have on memory usage on the node.

A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN  ACT TO  ENACT  THE  NORTH  CAROLINA  MONEY  TRANSMITTERS  ACT AS REQUESTED  BY THE  OFFICE  OF  THE  NORTH  CAROLINA  COMMISSIONER  OF BANKS.
**Virtual  currency.**  
A  digital  representation  of  value  that  can  be  digitally traded and functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of    value    but    only    to    the    extent    defined    as    stored    value    under G.S. 53-208.42(19),  but  does  not  have  legal  tender  status  as recognized  by the United States Government.
**Money transmission.**  
To engage in the business of any of the following:
* Sale or issuance of payment instruments or stored value primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; or
* Receiving  money  or  monetary  value  for  transmission  or  holding funds  incidental  to  transmission  with in  the  United  States  or  to locations   abroad   by   any   and   all   means,   including   payment instrument,   stored   value,   wire,   facsimile,   or   electronic   transfer, primarily  for personal, family, or household purposes. This includes maintaining control of **virtual currency** on behalf of others.
**Permissible  investments.**  
One  or  more  of  the  following,  but  only  to  the extent that they are maintained in an account located in the United States:
* i. **Virtual currency**  owned  by  the  licensee,  but  only  to  the  extent  of outstanding  transmission  obligations  received  by  the  licensee  in like-kind **virtual currency**.
**Surety bond**
* (d) The surety bond shall be in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner and shall run to the State for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to secure the faithful performance of  the  obligations  of  the  licensee  with  respect  to  the  receipt,  handling,  transmission,  and payment  of  money  or  monetary  value  in  connection  with  the  sale  and  issuance  of  payment instruments,  stored  value,  or  transmission  of  money.  The  Commissioner  has  the  discretion  to require the applicant obtain additional insurance coverage to address related cyber security risks inherent  in  the  applicant's  business  model  as  it  relates  to  **virtual  currency**  transmission  and  to the extent such risks are not within the scope of the required surety bond.
**Exemptions**  
This Article shall not apply to any of the following:
* (8) A person appointed by a payee to collect and process payments as the bonafide  agent  of  the  payee,  provided  the  person  can  demonstrate  to  the Commissioner that:  
* a. There  exists  a  written  agreement  between  the  payee  and  agent directing  the  agent  to  collect  and  process  payments  on  the  payee's behalf;
* b. The payee holds the agent out to the public as accepting payments on the payee's behalf; and
* c. Payment  is  treated  as  received  by  the  payee  upon  receipt  by  the agent.
This   exemption   would   extend   to   those   otherwise   engaged   in   money transmission    as    set    forth in G.S. 53-208.42(12)b.,    including    those transactions conducted in whole or in part in **virtual currency**.

This is really stupid because I know who you are, but I'll answer your questions.


The blockchain would still exist, it always will, it's a distributed database.  Saying it wouldn't would be like saying someone deleted Kim Kardashian's sex tape from the Internet.  No matter how many copies you delete, someone will always have a copy.  In my case, I'd have a copy of the blockchain.  So it would always exist.
If no one is mining, then the database (blockchain) wouldn't be updated, effectively making the entire bitcoin system useless in any real world application, hence why it would be a novelty item.


Same as above, 'bitcoin' is just entries in the database (blockchain).
I'm not downvoting you.

The merchant decides how they want to accept it.  If they have their own bitcoin wallet, they can make the sale after seeing the transaction being broadcast to the network (instantly).  They could wait for 1 confirmation, hell they could wait for 100 confirmations.

The 'very obvious difference' being quantities?  Come on, that's not a valid argument.
When I had my last surgery, I was prescribed with some kind of strong pain killer (I don't remember which because I didn't take them).  I do remember there were at least 20 pills in that bottle.  I could have taken all of those pills at once, and more than likely died.
The take away from this is it's the individuals responsibility to take a prescribed/safe amount of any given substance.  I'm unfortunately addicted to caffeine, but I limit my intake. (And no I'm not implying caffeine is a dangerous substance, its just the only thing I have I can compare to personally).

I chose not to take the pain medication because I knew it could be addictive.  I have a friend from high school who's now in jail due to pain killer addiction.  His addiction began after he was prescribed pain killers.  It was so bad he ended up robbing a pharmacy trying to get to more pills.


It would actually be easier for me to obtain illegal pain killers than legal ones.  I know people who 'work the system' if you will, just to get pills to sell to others.
We obviously have different mind sets/perspectives/world views.  Yours seems more state controlled whereas mine is more individual freedom.  Which probably explains you being in the buttcoin camp and I'm in the bitcoin camp.

In regards to the sybil attacks, cryptography enforce each miner to hold X amount of bitcoin to be able to submit blocks to the network.  Since bitcoin is limited supply, there is a maximum number of miners posible.  Maybe tie X number of bitcoins to hashpower.

I remember seeing an analysis of the blockchain over time, which showed how the coins were distributed to new addresses.  I searched but can't find it.  Around the times of bubbles, those bigger chunks were spread out to smaller amounts in more addresses.
Obviously this means nothing in terms of who owns what, because it was only analyzing the blockchain and addresses.  There is no way to accurately determine how many people own what.
All we do know is the controlled release (X BTC per block and halved every ~4 years).
That and the assumption early adopters will sell some of their BTC earnings for other assets as value rises.

@_date: 2015-07-20 17:07:23
While true, it helps to understand the differences between credit cards and bitcoin.
Credit card purchases operate as a pull system.  Meaning, the merchant typically has to have the credit card number and additional information to **request** the funds to be moved from the customers bank to the merchant.  This additional information usually includes a billing address.  The billing address is used as fraud prevention.
Bitcoin is a push system.  Meaning, the funds are pushed by the customer to the merchant.  The merchant does not have to have any additional information from the customer to receive the funds.  For example, there are VPN providers that accept bitcoin payments and do not require any personal information (name, address, etc...)

Infinite number of identical technologies, all with the same hashing power/security.
Then why has this not happened?  Why isn't there a Bitcoin1, Bitcoin2, Bitcoin3...?
My answer to that question would be of the [first mover advantage]( or any other Marketing Strategy.


I would word it a little differently.  Individual units of account are arbitrary, but they are finite.  The individual units of account can be replicated, but those new units of account would exist in a different system, and cannot be interchanged between the two systems.
So at that point, you would have:
* 21 million Bitcoins
* 21 million KayRiceCoins
* 21 million ____
* ....
But what's the difference?  Why isn't this being done?
The 'Bitcoin' network would not accept transactions from the 'KayRiceCoin' network.  The two units of account are similar, but they cannot hop between one network to the next.  So within the Bitcoin network, the units of account are finite, set to 21 million total.
One would have to go to the open market to exchange Bitcoins for KayRiceCoins, at an agreed upon exchange rate.
Going even further.  Why doesn't someone create a new layer above these networks, one that uses an infinite number of networks that are all merged mined?  This new layer would pick at random which network to use to sign transactions.  In this scenario, you would have what you claim, "individual units of account are arbitrary and infinite".  Because this master layer would choose which sub-network to use.  It might send the transaction on the Bitcoin network or the KayRiceCoin network.
To answer that question, miners choose which coin they mine, even in merged mining environments.
Namecoin is merged mine with Bitcoin, but not everyone who mines Bitcoin mines Namecoin.  The two networks have different mining difficulty levels, and different exchange rates.
EDIT: More info on merged mining:

For anyone reading this, you could flip a coin 160 times and have an open source RNG.

To expand on that, there are web sites that list the nodes in the Bitcoin network.  One example is 
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:16:43
I would say KayRiceCoin would have less utility than Bitcoin if it is a 1:1 clone.
In your example, the major difference between the two networks would be the hashing power behind them.  The KayRiceCoin would be insignificant in comparison to Bitcoin, thus much easier to attack.
As an end user who wishes to use one of those two technologies, I would choose the one that offers the most security.  I would not want to use a technology that could be tampered with by someone with a $500 miner.  In that case, I would say Bitcoin has the greater utility.

Bitcoin cannot be converted into fiat.  However, Bitcoin can be traded for fiat.  Rewording your question to "what if all bitcoins were traded for fiat", the answer would be all bitcoins exchanged hands for the market value at the time of exchange.  In the current market, this would mean supply greatly increased and most likely cause the market value to drop significantly.

If the signal is unaltered as it is bouncing around between peers, it would be very hard to trace the origin of the broadcast unless the attacker had several listening spots setup to try and catch the first transmission.
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:27:46
Yup, and the same applies to bitcoin nodes.  If someone had the resources to connect to nearly all active nodes, they could narrow down where the transaction originated from.
BUT... just because the transaction originated from X node doesn't mean the owner of that node is the sender.  There's several BitPay Insight installations floating around with an API that allows anyone to broadcast transactions through someone's node, or blockchain.info's api, TOR, 7 proxies, etc...

Imagine Company 1 sold an item for $1,000.  They only accept credit cards.
Company 2 sales the same item for $970 if you pay via Bitcoin. ($30 less because no credit card fees)
If the consumer has both Credit Cards and Bitcoin, who would the consumer most likely buy from?
Also the Merchant has an incentive to accept Bitcoin because no charge backs/fraud.

Grinds my gears when ever I hear someone repeatedly ask "Who gives out the new coins" as in there's still someone running the show.  I guess when you live in a world dominated by centralized systems, it's hard to change your mindset to understand decentralized.
My response to this question is: the software is written in a way that rewards the miners who find the blocks with new coins and transaction fees.  Other miners verify the previous blocks to make sure they are following the rules of the network.  Essentially, it is a huge network of checks and balances.

How Bitcoin originated?  The idea of a cryptographic currency has been around a while, or at least talked about in the cryptography world.  Bitcoin is the implementation of these ideas.  Bitcoin was well thought out in the beginning, and has been modified for improvements since then by several developers (and continues to be improved upon).

You only "lose money every hour" if you exchange to fiat during those hours for a net loss.  Otherwise, you're still minting the same number of coins.  I would never exchange for a loss.  Many people say that the miners profit margins are the floor for the exchange rates; meaning, miners (who mint new coins) would never sell for a loss, thus keeping prices above a certain threshold.  Of course, this wouldn't apply to a catastrophic event, as in a major flaw was found in Bitcoin and the price goes to &gt;$1.


Only "losing money" if you sell.


Miners do wait for the price to go up.  Mine during the dips, sell during the highs.  If they turn the rigs off during the dips, they wouldn't have as many coins to sell during the highs.


I have more faith in non-inflationary assets.  I might be wrong, I might be right.


I mine to secure the blockchain, the coins are the rewards for doing that.


Started off as a hobby, turned in to months of education for a better understanding what "money" is, and how it works.

While explaining to people in person, I stick with the term miner, since this is typically what they've heard from other sources.
I've found that mixing in the term 'node' will confuse them, unless you explain what a node is.  And to do that I say:  To be connected to the Bitcoin network, your computer runs a software client known as a node.  Nodes connect to other nodes to form a peer to peer network where everyone is essentially connected.  Think of a huge room with lots of people standing talking to one another.  Those people have to announce to the person standing beside them what transactions are taking place.  Word of mouth spreads this transaction very quickly around the room.  Each person holds a ledger containing all accounts and balances, and that person verifies that the transaction is *plausible* based on their ledger before passing it to the next person.
From there you get into the double spend problem, and how some nodes mine to update the ledger (blockchain) and spread it around the room.
(I realize this isn't how it works on a technical level, but is a good way to describe what is going on, in layman's terms.)
The best/easiest way to teach something to someone, is to relate it to something they already know and understand.

I would say to spend the paper wallet, they will need to load the paper wallet into their main wallet, be it BitcoinQT, Blockchain, etc...  Once the paper wallet is imported, consider the paper wallet no longer valid, the software wallet will handle the address and/or change addresses.
After importing, I wouldn't advise throwing the paper wallet away, in case something goes wrong.  If someone ever sends coins to the paper wallet address, you'll be able to spend them.
So think of a paper wallet as archiving the private key in an offline format, and don't throw the archive away just in case.

So, all I would have to do is make a coin that displays the first characters of an address from that list.  The private key is hidden, so the buyer of the counterfeit coin couldn't verify until they attempted to spend it, at which point they will reveal a fake private key behind the hologram.

I can't comment on Blockchain, but when you first set up a BitcoinQT wallet, there are several change addresses created.  If you load a paper wallet private key into QT, and spend a fraction of that paper wallet address, the change will be sent to one of those change addresses, and the paper wallet address will be zeroed out.  Some people have a hard time with this, and even lose coins this way, because they make a transaction then delete the wallet.dat file thinking the remaining coins are still stored on the paper wallet address.
Blockchain may handle it differently, I'm just not sure.  Its all up to how the wallet software handles change addresses.

It would make for a great video, but there's one problem.  Average Joe doesn't care how it works, just that it's easy to use.  For example, I would imagine a large percentage of people who use email don't have the slightest clue how it works, they just know it does.
So a video of that nature will be passed around by tech minded people who are looking for an explanation.  We already have several videos like that out there.
If the end goal is to help average Joe, we need an easy way to use Bitcoin, without having to know how it works.
Cash in hand is easy, because you can pull it out of your pocket and hand it to them, boom its done, and average Joe understands that.
With mobile phones/apps its getting easier, but I believe there's still room to improve.
As far as confidence is concerned, over time, average Joe's confidence will increase as more and more people around him use it successfully.

Intrinsic Value:


The blockchain is what gives Bitcoin its value.  Miners build a distributed public ledger with checks and balances in a peer-to-peer network, without a central authority.
So when Peter claims Bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value, he's only looking at the surface (the coins).  This would be the equivalent to saying a company is worth nothing after only reading its name on a sheet of paper.  You have to look at what lies beneath the surface.  In the case of a company, you would look at the workers, business model, physical assets, location, market, etc...  With Bitcoin, you have to look at the blockchain, cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, etc...

* OP says Peter influences a lot of people.
* If the Bitcoin community changed Peter's mind, it could have a ripple effect and more people would buy in, hence my response.
* OP responds: the more the merrier!
* I say "Daddy needs a new wife!".
Huge down votes on that.  I can see how that would invoke down votes and your comment; it screams unhealthy mental state on the surface.  My mental process for that sentence was a combination of two things, the old saying "Daddy needs a new car!", which is typically used by a gambler before rolling the die at the roulette table.  I substituted "wife" in for "car" to give it an extreme, edgy note.  Hence hyperbole.
I've had this happen before on here.  I used a Dane Cook quote, "Punch a baby in the face":   Some guy blew up at me, went fucking crazy, made threats, etc. (On a different Reddit handle from this one).

What if you had relatives in another country that needed money quicker than a few business days?  (Wire transfer)
What if you didn't want to pay a remittance company high fees?
What if you wanted to purchase a car with cash on the weekend or holiday, and the banks where your funds are stored were closed?
