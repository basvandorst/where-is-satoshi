I don't even know what I spent. I bought it kind of for fun here and there over a period of 6 months. I would guess it was about 1,000 dollars total, maybe a little more or less. I aslo gave a bunch away

Sorry but I want my money. I've discussed it with my fiancee and I there is no turning back. But moving 20 a day doesn't seem like enough. Do these limits apply to new investors also? Why would anybody buy a large amount of bitcoins if they knew they couldn't sell them all when they wanted to? Seems like a difficult hurdle to pass

I don't even know what AML is. But I have already looked into an accountant.

I didn't even know it was a ground floor. I was just looking for a way to hide money from the college so I could get more loans. Also we were sending it to each other as a sort of game. Nothing special. Pure luck

That isn't true at all. Many of my friends were aquiring bitcoin in college as well. I had a very nerdy roommate who told me to buy it and I believed him and I aquired all my coins in less than 6 months.

I don't mind verifying with an exchange. I want to do this in the safest most legal way possible. I just didn't want to post on my regular account because I don't want friends and Facebook people knowing.

A house and maybe rental properties. I don't know. Can I even buy a house with bitcoin?

I admit that I am confused. I am lucky to have walked into this and I think it would be smart to get out since I don't really know what I am doing.

Dude I have already made more money than I need. I think I did good for myself. I understand that many people will tell me to hold but I can't. I just want to pay off my student loans, then buy a house and make my parents proud before they die.
