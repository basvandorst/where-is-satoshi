This is wonderful news.
AJE is a fantastic station with coverage close to the quality of the BBC, and they also produce excellent documentaries!

Do you mind letting these guys know? I seem not to be able to post in there:
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:34:18
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:55:55
Hurrah from Plymouth!
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:21:55
Yes, I think so!
@_date: 2013-10-30 09:40:21
aww thanks for the tip!! :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:03:52
thanks, I will check it out!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:58:13
This is very true. The market I am more looking at is bespoke porn - camgirl sessions, requests for specific poses/activities in still shots, etc.

Thank you! I don't expect to convert many clients to using them, but when I screen, I require a small deposit - a fraction of a bitcoin is better than a tenner put into Amazon Gift Certificates or a phone topup!
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:20:50
Please don't invest in bitcoin - take some of your SPENDING money, convert it to bitcoin, and spend it. On beer, sex toys, graphics cards, etc!
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:50:56
I've taken the line out.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:16:23
Never fust a trart! :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:50:32
Excellent, have dropped you an email, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:50:24
So, did Jeff get his data back? Poor Jeff!
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:48:10
Edits and corrections are really welcome - I truly want an accurate and brief explanation for a lay audience. :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:53:13
I love kraken!
What I would like to know is if my UK bank is likely to be OK with me getting SEPA transfers of euros into my £ account?
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:18:32
No worries, I've sorted it :) thanks for your civility!
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:59:28
Indeed, I am getting a mixed response.  That said, in the present system, with so many people struggling under dictatorships, any lovers of justice should support an anonymous currency that helps them fight back.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:51:54
Thank you indeed! I've had a bit of dust, I just leave it where it's received :) it's been growing too :D
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:02:57
Just a message of congratulations :) I love these sorts of stories.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:02:06
yes, the *trickle from faucets!*
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:31:50
Tips,  by the way, are also welcome :) and if you don't think a socialist should get tips,  you don't need to give me any! :)
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:23:42
I am based in Plymouth in the far southwest x
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:43:01
Yes, I am the investment police! I even have handcuffs! And a taser! And  a jail cell :)
I guess I am a bit evangelical today because three different people have asked me if they should sell their bitcoins :)
The more btc are used in ordinary commerce, the more stable and viable your hoarded bitcoins will be. :) I'm one of the voices on the more sparsely-populated other side.
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:33:10
I'm actually what I say I am. Check my post history.
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:47:27
Aagh! I am so not a computer scientist, or an economist :) If someone technically minded can help me work out a clear, concise and more accurate explanation, that would be great.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:08:59
I love this! You are clever and awesome,  This sub seems to be full of interesting btc related businesses :)
edited to ask: Does your approach work on other passwords?
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:28:38
I also session in Bristol :) x
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:48:42
Do left subreddits actually organise and do any productive stuff?
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:08:22
Lots of us are already doing it! I take bitcoin and it's working well so far :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:05:44
You know what, you're right.  Fuck cashing out, I am going to buy latex with some and then leave the rest as a savings and occasional spending account - I am going to start paying 'fiat money' IN :)
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:26:08
Thank you! Now to put this on my website and various profiles and see if some awesome nerd wants to pay me in btc!
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:33:10
I have just registered for it - do I need to advertise something in my twitter profile to get people to tip me this way?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:11:47
aww, thank you :)
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:02:03
Thank you - I think I may do this.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:56:43
Thank you sidaz :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:46:33
This is actually a very good point... I wonder what we could do to circumvent this - possibly age verification to be let into such a market at all?
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:42:49
I am thinking I am going to have to edit that article a bit, and apologise for my one jerky point.  The organisation I am in is actually having an ongoing discussion about civility in politics, I should have been more civil.
I won't actually be able to get to that until this evening, though.
edit: 36 hours later, have taken out the 'what's worse' sentence.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:46:57
Thank you Anita, I will check that out :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:51:16
I've taken the line out.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:03:26
The fact that they are calling it a currency is a huge step to legitimacy :)
