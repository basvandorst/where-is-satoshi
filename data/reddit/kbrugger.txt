Would you expand on your objective views about what is it that you consider "poor" of BitLox? I'm sure the Bitcoin community would appreciate that instead of what appears to be a mindless rant or an act of trolling.

Thanks alot, that's good to know.
Do you know if Cashila accepts payments in USD? Or does it only work with Euros?

Ok, I got it backwards then. My understanding was that these services allowed you to pay _with bitcoin_ where bank transfer was expected on the recipient side.
In my case, recipient is expecting bitcoin, and sender needs to pay with a bank transfer... Still on the right track?

Thanks, although most of those services are for paying bills _with_ bitcoin. I need someone to send money from a USD bank to a bitcoin user seamlessly.

Of course, I was precisely thinking how odd that was.

Couldn't verify my phone. Confirmation code was never sent... (and there is not a resend button or something)
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:18:14
[This]( is a good starting point.
@_date: 2015-07-31 15:01:43
Isn't it?
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:43:48


Yeah right...

The initiative of releasing Bitcoin XT is akin to the nature of open source. We agree on that.
When I talk about authoritarianism, I talk about Hearns repeatedly expressed views on the matter. It's just his philosophy, and a valid one, just that I don't share it.

That's not authoritarianism.
Satoshi did what he had to do because he created the whole thing in the first place. But after he distances from the project, the bases were laid out for it to grow in a decentralized and democratic way. There's no need for "benevolent dictators" at this point.

And therefore, the other two made the resolution and released their client version so the community take a vote. That's cool. No problem with that.
@_date: 2015-09-08 21:25:55
Hearn's view was at least similar in 2013 _regarding_ _max_ _block_ _size_.
IMO, I don't think Satoshi would endorse Hearn's authoritarian views on Bitcoin development.
Most core devs, anyway, share the idea that blocksize should be raised somehow.

Five guys being "authoritarians" (as you choose to call them) are not trying to trample over among themselves. As far as I know, most of the core dev team advocates for consensus and thoroughful study of the issues before making precipitated changes to a $3.4bn platform. That's no authoritarianism.
In any case, I don't judge what Hearn and Andresen are trying to do. They're releasing their forking solution, and the miner community will get to vote on the issue, that's very democratic.
When I talk about authoritarianism, I'm referring to the opinions of Mike Hearn regarding the whole development of Bitcoin, that's the way he thinks and he has repeatedly expressed so.
If Satoshi Nakamoto comes back from the shadows and wants to take the reins of Bitcoin, he can be as authoritarian as he wants. But Hearn is just Hearn.

That's the spirit! :D
