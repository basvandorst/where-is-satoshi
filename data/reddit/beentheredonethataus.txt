The UN is not, instead it is specifically the ["Twenty-First Century African Youth Movement - Sierra Leone"]( which was founded by [Abu-Hassan "Askia" Koroma]( whose group are asking for [volunteers.](

I live in Italy and regularly transfer money.  The 20% tax is NOT for international transfers.  Reread the article.

While I like to think I have some standards, realistically if $100,000 or more is on the line, then I might be persuaded to forge something.  
You can get many things in this world, if you are willing to pay.

If this is a large and highly rated airline, then this would be a death sentence.  For international airlines media is free for the viewer (factored into the price).  This isn't Ryanair.

When I deposit cheques into my account it appears as deposited.  But the money is not *available* to me until it clears.  My bank account shows two balance columns.
Bank cheques are guaranteed, personal cheques are not.  It's why some places do not accept personal cheques (embassies for Visas etc.)

No.  Because the cheque was deposited.  It has not yet cleared.  I get similar things for other transactions.  It shows that there is a pending amount.  There are two columns "Total Funds" and "Available Funds".
It helps for book keeping, because I know they have received the amount and are now processing it.  I can walk up to an ATM on Friday night and deposit a cheque and the bank will record it as deposited, but not cleared until Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday etc.

I am.  If it doesn't he definitely would be able to make some waves about it.

Oh Hell yes!  If you want to talk, grab a coffee and argue, discuss, complain work things out 'till your heart's content.  Lecture hours are for the lectures.  Get the info, then deal with it.

Can one have rights without obligations or duties?  We can manufacture rights, but with rights can come the sense of entitlement.
