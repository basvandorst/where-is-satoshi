Is there a contingency plan to return users coins if(/when) regulators decide that Coinbase is actually a bank, and as such is not in compliance, the site is seized and the company needs to be shut down?

This guy was a total Scumbag, he should have got more.

If you spoke with Coinbase the way you address this forum they should be suspicious, why have 3 accounts, sounds like you are shit and they were just treating you accordingly.

You would not make a good lawyer, there seemed to be quite a bit of evidence that Gox would have to have been involved. what about the bot running on local servers that only a few at Gox could have accessed? What about the same user ID being used for the bot and later for Mark's personal account? But you probably didn't read the report, so fcuk yourself anyway.

And there is more Monopoly money printed in a year than Bitcoin's market cap. No way it can compete with Monopoly money!

"Failed"? because it has not increased in price in the last 12 months? WTF kind of metric is that? Did the internet and Linux 'increase in price'? that fuck is this idiot talking about?

Why is this not on top. OP is a math-tard.

[Many of us pretend that BTC isn't an inflationary currency, but it is. We still need millions pouring into BTC every week just to keep the price stable. Amazingly people hold up transaction volume as a reason why price is sure to rise too, but again, just to stabilize, millions of $ need to go in and stay and this clearly isn't happening and until people start retirement savings in BTC it's not going to. (IMO) See this article:

u/moleccc, NOT TRUE! It is not true that, "this must be considered a normal aspect of Bitcoin", maybe the current Bitcoin Core code, but not Bitcoin, and its not the bitcoin I want to support. I want 10 min. confirmation times and the ability to accept 0 confirmations transactions instantly if I want to, current Core code disallows both of these things.

What a weird turd. He said we owned the .com, but then the "owner" made them give it back because his business was having too many charges reversed but never knew about it? Then with his "2.0" venture, "everything was going great, we were killing it" for THREE days before going under. Turd city.
