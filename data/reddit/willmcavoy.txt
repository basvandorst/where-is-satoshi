I think the whole opportunity was squandered. Initial Coin Offerings? The tech will now forever be associated with the old finance world now. And I’m slowly realizing it is because the “gurus” that drive the “industry” wanted to be Wall Street all along. They never wanted to upset the status quo. They wanted to join the status quo.

I don’t hold bitcoin. I was extremely excited about the possibilities for the technology but it was hijacked for Wall Street speculation. It makes me sick to my stomach to think about what could have been achieved, the power that could have changed hands. Instead while every one is “hodling” and telling me I’m an idiot on the outside, financial institutions are stealing the technology to further cement the banking structures which enslaved society in the first place.  
  
I have no doubt some buyers had good intentions. But I also fear most have no real concern for the tech and its applications. They only wanted to get rich. Not realizing that bitcoin was never about financial *gain.* It was about financial *freedom.* Freedom from the centralized control of shady organizations like the World Bank and Federal reserve. Bitcoiners’ own greed will ruin the Nakamoto’s vision. If he ever existed at all.

Greed is not even a good enough term. I’ve never “bought in” not because I’m a coward or a doubter. But because I saw crypto currency as a way to change the dynamic between the power structure and the people. The fact that it’s been turned into a Wall Street speculation game makes me sick to my stomach. It’s all the things crytocurency NEVER should have been.

So what. That’s not the point. It’s ridiculous to think that it’s not upsetting or alarming that it’s dropping at such a rate. People annoy me with this “there’s nothing to worry about!” because quite frankly there was something to worry about when it was skyrocketing as well. Volatility is never a good thing when it comes to investment and now we’re seeing why. This is something to be upset about. It’s not nothing losing 50% value.

Thanks. Hopefully some read it and realize Bitcoin was never supposed to be a stock, and a post like this displays just how far the dream has fallen. Instead of solving world problems, it’s a bragging right. A stock tip. A game of oneupsmanship. A fucking told-ya-so.

That’s a great point. I was really just trying to get a sense of the thoughts people have, whether this is real growth or just hype.

Don’t know much about this so excuse me if I’m asking a dumb question. Are you guys afraid of a bubble?

“Right now I’m thinking.. I want that second belt where is it?!”

So If I bought 5 dollars worth of bitcoin when the price was at 5k it would be work 10 dollars today? Sorry, I know thats a weak question.

Economics are about balance and sustainable growth. I guess that’s why your answer bothers me kinda. Wishing continued success though. Important that bitcoin succeeds for many reasons.

That’s awesome man congratulations. Do I need 10k to buy in or can I buy in with any amount?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:04:10
Thank you, that was actually my original question really. Is this insanity? Is it some sort of just unnatural inflation due to hype? Your answer suggests you believe it can even out even higher.
