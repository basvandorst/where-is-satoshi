Well unless hookers and drug dealers have started carrying card machines you can’t get them on credit as that requires cash. (If you’re willing to use a credit card to get cash that’s another thing, but I imagine your card company would stop your credit line pretty swiftly).
Gambling is a separate thing but the majority of people who have credit cards wouldn’t be foolish enough to gamble with borrowed money so the banks must see this as a small element of risk.
However in my mind their reason for banning crypto purchases on credit is because people who are normally risk adverse may still decide to buy large amounts of bitcoin thinking it’s a ‘sure thing’ due to the astronomical gains it saw last year and the massive media coverage. Then when these people get large debts there is very little to take from them to recover said debt as if they’d had money to invest in the first place they wouldn’t have used a credit card.
Or those who are reliant on credit cards and already have massive debt may see crypto as a way out of their debt. So the banks have made it so they can’t try and effectively gamble their way out. Which in my mind is a good thing. 
If you’re buying on credit you’re not listening to rule number one, as clearly you can’t afford to lose what you’re buying.

I’m pretty sure you’re wrong here. In the UK if you cannot pay off your credit cards they can (and often do) take you to court to enforce payment which can ultimately lead to enforcement action. This enforcement action leads to bailiff action or debt orders to recover what is owed. 
Unless you’ve declared bankruptcy there is almost always recourse for your creditors to get what they’re owed.

You are right that they love people being in debt, but they only want you in debt you have a chance of paying back, or they want you buying assets that can be seized in order to make up the debt. Their worry is that people will run up huge debts on credit cards buying crypto and if crypto then fails those people will have to declare bankruptcy. This would result in the banks being stuck with huge amount of debts and they would only be able to seize potentially worthless assets in the form of the crypto those people bought. So they would end up having to write off massive debts.

Thank you so much for your insightful comments, I have been persuaded to change my mind on use cases for Bitcoin now! Well done!

Or you can actually realise that as LN hasn’t been implemented yet my point does stand and you’re being defensive over a coin for no reason? 
Also if you think bitcoin is going to replace traditional currency you’re lying to yourself.

To be fair he isn’t wrong. As a currency I don’t see bitcoin will work, you can’t use it to buy small cheap things without drastically over paying.
I see that It’s like gold in this case, it is too cumbersome and expensive to use for day to day transactions, however as a store of value I think it’s definitely achieved it’s goal. So come the next recession we may see Crypto as a safe haven

You’re right, the pound - euro hasn’t been at €1.40 for a bloody long time.
