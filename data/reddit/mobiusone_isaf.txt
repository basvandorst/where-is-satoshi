I just wish people would stop memeing Bitcoin into pump and dump cycles. This is like the 5th? god damn time this shit has happened. Worst part is the value is so high it's not really useful as a currency anymore.

If it means you can buy lunch without kicking yourself about "$10,000,000 pizza" a year down the line, yeah.
Bitcoin is an interesting idea in itself, and it continues to be. However, it falls short on the original goal as a currency, and everyone memeing about it being "the future" is just delusional.

The value in that it keeps on rising endlessly, making it almost absurd to consider spending it rather than hold onto it. One of the staples of a useful currency is stability. Buying a drink one year shouldn't be the same price as a GPU in the span of months. It's gotten to the point where the swings in price are extreme enough ($2000 -&gt; $16000 -&gt; $7000 in like 6 months) that you'd have to be insane (or all the other options are Zimbabwe level bad) to use Bitcoin like cash.
The original goal was a digital currency, not a digital gold / slot machine. But not much I can do but lament.

5 year old also wouldn't be involved in Bitcoin. To be fair it's very clear, explains the jargon well, and answers a lot of the questions that would inevitability be asked when a half baked eli5 doesn't fully explain what's mostly politics and technicalities.

Still stings to know that spending anything is just screwing yourself over. Like I bought all my Christmas gifts with Bitcoin in 2013, it was cool. Now if I kept then and used USE I could have bought a new car as a gift. 
The INSANE rate of deflation for it makes me not want to spend any of the coins that I'm holding on too (few thousand USD) because one day if this keeps bubbling I'd have a life changing sum. 
I'm not saying it's gonna stop Bitcoin's use as currency, but for me it's a huge stop sign

I know I was one of the early majority, got into a hobby of it in 2013. Only regret is not mining/buying more

Had a few gaming rigs running Bitcoin and Litecoin since I wasn't paying for the power, mined like 5 BTC Back when prices were between $30-100. Figured I'd use some for christmas shopping. 
Kind of a shame really, actually using a currency as a currency instead of gold 3.0 is apparently screwing yourself :\
