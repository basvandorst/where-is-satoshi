Are most people in here 100% invested in bitcoin or do you allocate some to altcoins (in case bitcoin someday becomes the AOL of crypto)?

I don’t think bitcoin can do that, Ethereum would

No, I heard they pool the inventory
@_date: 2019-10-18 20:21:10
They realized most of the trading is in asia so thats where they can make the big bucks, that’s why binance does so well. Binance had more futures volumes than CME because asia.
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:50:08
These three comments were great, especially the top one. I’ll just add that, decide where you’re going to take profits along the way and stick to it, don’t get greedy. Anyone crying about these drops should get some pampers.

too many traders
@_date: 2019-10-16 23:55:13
I was accumulating around 3K, any of these consolidation periods are good times to accumulate, especially if it goes down to 6k. I'm good with my stack though so I'm holding for the big one.

Let us know if you're able to do this with bitcoin, i'm curious to know

Wtf is this? Started reading and saw how long it is and stopped
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:15:38
Wow, but that was at 9am, shouldn’t you check at the end if the day?
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:30:10
wow, how can they ban you for telling the truth, lol
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:20:27
It is true, it shot up while i was still accumulating. I read somewhere that there are only 10 days each year that account for most of the gains
@_date: 2019-10-02 00:43:51
Hello bitcoin, this is Ethereum, we should be friends!
@_date: 2019-10-16 23:29:48
Is the Bitcoin in your wallet? If so, you can send it whenever you want to.
@_date: 2019-10-05 20:55:25
Don’t panic
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:16:55

@_date: 2019-10-03 20:09:57
We still have the whole October left, so it could go down to 7K and then back up
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:10:06
Maybe a 30% correlation
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:26:29
Yes I saw this too, very weird
@_date: 2019-10-08 01:16:48
Maybe he's from another country

What about the guy masturbating to the stock to flow model
@_date: 2019-10-22 21:39:43
ETH has different uses from BTC, for example there’s  decentralized finance, gaming, and other things being built on Ethereum. BTC is most well known by people, has been around a long time, mostly used to send to people in countries, hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. I hold both.

There are people out there calling bitcoin and every other crypto a scam. Yes there are a lot of scams and scammers out there, but just because you don't like something, you don’t understand it,  or it doesn't benefit you doesn't mean it's a scam.

@_date: 2019-10-10 17:53:40
Coinbase should be easy to setup with your bank account and deposit usd to buy bitcoin. They increased the fees recently, so I think people are using cashapp or Gemini.
@_date: 2019-10-18 20:20:04
You can’t use Polo anymore
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:15:14
I don't know if everyone here read the Bitwise paper, but it talks about the correlation being about 12%

Are you kidding, I would upvote this twice if I could
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:29:35
Well if we go back to 3k I can finish accumulating
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:42:31
rollecoaster guy is back. it does seem that price drops right before CME future expirations.

@_date: 2019-10-07 10:53:07
It’s too volatile for payment. I tried using it once to pay someone in Europe and when he checked it the next day the payment was less than the agreed amount
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:14:03
I’m glad we solved it Watson
@_date: 2019-10-02 18:10:18
It seems there’s some correlation with the markets and crypto?
@_date: 2019-10-07 00:46:56
It sounds like they’re selling and withdrawing cash?
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:01:40
@_date: 2019-10-25 00:25:33
And why does everyone have different TA results, so weird how every one of them is different
@_date: 2019-10-02 11:56:56
Ethereum has tokens that do this, I don’t think you can do it with bitcoin easily
@_date: 2019-10-23 00:43:06
Nice to see a sub where people are given advice like this and not told to just blindly hodl
@_date: 2019-10-23 08:59:38
I don’t trade, but I should’ve taken profits along the way instead of hodling.  There are some subs that downvote anything bearish negative and fill the place with hopium so you get confused.
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:23:19
See 4th bullet in the post
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:32:59
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:17:29
Yes take profits along the way
@_date: 2019-10-02 10:59:54
Well I hold both bitcoin and Ethereum because I see value in both. I think Bitcoin is limited in what it can do and people don’t realize it yet, but once they realize what you can do on Eth I think it will do very well.  One example is DeFi where many of us are earning interest on our holdings. Someday Bitcoin may become the AOL of crypto, so you never know
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:13:12
So is my dog
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:57:00
I would tell you not to gold it because its a waste of money

@_date: 2019-10-17 14:31:31
You can’t be banned from Bitcoin either, Bitcoin can never ban me no matter what i say or do. The reason why we need decentralized apps and gaming is because of banning, look what happened at Blizzard. You can’t be banned from a game on a decentralized network.

I like your thoughts, very real. It’s true there are a lot of traders in the space now. It caught wall street’s attention and now there’s future, options, and everyone that wants to try trading like tone vays.
@_date: 2019-10-10 13:47:06
There are people out there that think Bitcoin is a scam or can't be used, this is from the Bitwise newsletter:
*Some will say, “That sounds like the future, but is it actually being used? I don’t see many people paying for their coffee with bitcoin.”*
*But that’s the wrong place to look. The truth is, there are many types of transactions in the world. Bitcoin doesn’t need to be used for all of them to be important; PayPal isn’t, nor are bank wires.*
*To be meaningful, bitcoin just needs to be better than traditional payment mechanisms at a few things, and those first few use cases are becoming clearer each day: remittance payments, migrants moving to a new country (*[*260 million people per year*]( a low-minimum digital offshore bank account for the privacy-focused, and a way for people in countries with collapsing currencies to get their savings out of local fiat currencies.*

I've never used keepkey as it's still on the way. I'm not really sure how it works, but at least it's better than nothing.  Maybe you could try this offer to get it for $10, but you would have to sign up on shapeshift and do the KYC:  [
