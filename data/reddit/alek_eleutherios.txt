As author mentioned, the volatility is an issue. And, as far as modern finance theory is concerned, you can't really "solve" this. Unless you're a Central bank within a fractional reserve financial system and you can print infinite.
Volatility is a side-effect of a risk. And Bitcoin's risk is a very certain thing. You can't simply eliminate such risk.
So, the answer is, Bitcoin cannot function as a currency in current financial system. 
If the financial system changes, or the perception of Bitcoin's risk is altered in minds of its potential users, then we might have another look at it. But not today, sorry.

Time to panic?
Go buy some BTC put. While you still can.

Looking at how the implied vols are changing in BTC options there's definitely some kind of a "calming down" expectation building in the market.

Not really. If you do not take into account newly born platforms where people draw fake volumes to attract their first client then it is only Deribit and LedgerX out there.
However, if you join all of those people asking Deribit to introduce longer maturities they might finally change their mind.
And yeah, I would not call LedgerX great. It's a mickey mouse exchange with no liquidity.

The article claims that with this move Bitflyer would become the only licensed crypto-platform in EU. This is not true. Bitstamp has got their license quite some time ago.

I never mentioned anything regarding "having value". I said that functioning as a mean of payment is very problematic due to volatility.
There are plenty of historical examples when actual currencies ceased to exist due to high volatility. In most of the cases this was due to hyper-inflation.
In case of a Bitcoin you have hyper-deflation. But it is not any better for a "currency".

Relax, my dear gamblers.
Your trading decisions are nearly perfect. And the only reason you're not making any money is The Bad Guys.

Have you bothered checking for how long the US equity market had been in an upward trend?
Hint: check since Feb 2016.
Oh, another hint: now check since Nov 2011.

Market maker makes money on the spread. The fees go to the exchange, unfortunately(
Regarding the OPs question: this is a very wrong place to ask a financial question. Just check wikipedia. That'd be good enough.
Just a quick one: normally market effects are distributed across similar markets. If someone takes a position aggressively on a future market one would expect same direction (nearly immediate) effect on the underlying of such future.

I am surprised there are no replies.
Are you still interested? I can share some information.

Same here. Some sneaky sellers from amazon are exploiting the current hype to sell people the Nano S with a hefty premium.

Open interest on CME and CBOE combined is 3 times less than in relatively illiquid Okex weekly future that expires on the same date.

A "decent fill" is when you get your deltas done "at theo".
Eg I need to sell 1000 futures, my "neutral" point is at 9285.5 and I get them done at 9285.1 after fees. This is a decent fill. 
After reading the article I am tempted to suggest that the author fell a victim of his poor execution.
An efficient market is supposed to react to additional information. Every time a new accommodative order comes in HFTs and market makers react. To avoid that one has to either do his size in an "iceberg" fashion (revealing only x% of his size at a time) or just wait for an appropriate volume on the opposing side and hit in full.

Technology wise Deribit is superior to Bitmex.
Liquidity wise Bitmex is superior to Deribit.
Both are secure and trusted enough.
As much as a web trading platform without clearing and license can be.

What the article describes is a typical structured bull note with capital protection. These things were quite popular among institutional investors in conventional markets 10-15 years ago.
You can try to structure such payoff yourself. Then indeed you'd need access to some BTC options. Deribit options would be a good choice. Easy to register and to trade. Also decently tight spreads at the moment.
Another alternative would be to look for a structured note that is already adjusted for your retail needs. As far as I know there are such things on swiss exchange. Might wanna google Vontobel and Leonteq. But those are not tailored and you do pay some excessive fees for hassle-free solution.

The author can claim whatever. And he might be even not completely wrong. But... Whenever I need to do a big amount of BTC futures in one goal I can always expect a decent fill on Okex. This is by far the most liquid BTC futures platform at the moment. If they only had longer term maturities I'd be completely happy with them.
