I searched for Mycelium on App Store about a month ago, but couldn't find it at that time. Now I can....another fake?

Awesome! Understand if you don't want to answer, but what was Bitcoin price when you bought it? Also what did you pay for it? (Just wondering what the margin was for the item itself). Sorry if I missed this info elsewhere on this post.
I don't know anything about these items. But based on the comments of others; as the item ages and btc price increases, the risk that a previous owner will have taken the coins increases (eg if the creator has the private key and price increases enough for him to use it). So i'd guess the price of the item will change from having a premium beyond x1000 btc (to include the gold you mentioned), to less than that as you have to discount the risk. You also have to factor in the value of its relative uniqueness....but arguably this isn't lost if the item is opened. Interesting!!!

Bitcoin n00bie reporting in! :)
I've been lurking here for a couple of months, as I've been meaning to learn more for a couple of years now and maybe get involved....by which I mean definitely not mining; I'm not that techie. Maybe firstly thinking of putting a little bit of my savings into Bitcoin, as a bit of a long term play. Then if I like it, then maybe starting to use for transactions where available. Appreciate that is probably a bit arse-backwards, but I'd kick myself if I was using bitcoins but missed out on any big gains by not holding a some as savings. I do appreciate there is a risk, but I see it as a bit of speculation.
So my question is: based on what I've read on this Reddit, it sounds like we're currently in a bit of bubble with the halving coming, so should I avoid buying any bitcoins as savings for the time being? Understand there will be a lot of complexity to any answer here, but from what I've heard the price rise over the last year doesn't really sound like a new base level...?

You gotta give the Nigerian prince time to send the btc to u/Coincle in the first place
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:34:44
And that's acceptable?!?

Make my wallet great again!

What's everyone gonna spend their 0.01 on, if u/Coincle pays up?
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:44:39
Do you think it's worth buying now? Surely that's just short-term to try and pick the top and then sell?
I've been waiting for a decent sized drop for a few months now - waiting to buy more. I guess if I'd just gone back then, I'd be laughing now though

Ok mate, sure I don’t understand. And you’re so obnoxious no-one is even trying to engage with you about what you believe

I meant the fee. A good question though: clearly the low wages is terrible, but a bit beyond the scope of Bitcoin.
A fee of that magnitude isn't going to be acceptable to vast numbers of people; and not just in countries with hyperinflation. When people are used to getting something for free (eg transferring money (in-county), or paying for things with cash) they will not readily accept having to pay for the same service.
For example I'm from the UK, last year we had to start paying £0.05 for each plastic bag at a super market. It's a minor amount of money, but when you're used to something being free, then even a smal fee is unpalatable. The fee has dramatically reduced useage of plastic bags, because people just don't want to pay it, even when it's a trivial amount compared to their shopping bill.
Any transaction fee will be a barrier to mass adoption of Bitcoin in countries with well regulated banks. But large fees just exasperate that I think.

Mate you are a troll or an idiot. Just because someone disagrees with you, doesn’t mean they don’t understand it. And sure you can pose a question, but when that question has nothing to do with the person’s original statement, that persons failure to answer does not indicate they don’t understand
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:18:25
Totally agree with your reasoning....but if you are in it for a long-term view, then you wouldn't buy in this peak, just wait for a dip, because over longer term they are inevitable.
Unless you think we are currently in the crazy growth bit right now?....but is there anything that could explain unprecedented growth? (which it would have to be, if it were to be sustained)
@_date: 2016-12-22 16:10:57
But I can't believe anyone would make a long-term investment at this point, because undoubtedly there is going to be a stop at some point......right?!

How's it gonna emerge when you stop any new users joining by making it so ridiculously difficult to adopt?
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:12:50
Haha a true technovisionary!
Plus the biggest downside of bitcoin is that you can’t use it for that. Let’s face it, no-one would use paper wallets if it wasn’t for snorting drugs ��

Haha, I remember when smart phones were on the brink of touch screen technology (the end of the Nokia era). I just couldn’t understand why it was such a big deal. The little joystick I had for moving the mouse cursor worked fine, and I could navigate websites using WAP and by clicking on the miniscule links just fine....the rest of people who couldn’t be bothered to hold their phone 5cm from their face were obviously technophobes!
Man I was wrong on that one!
Personally I’m completely underwhelmed by the push for foldable screen technology, but I’ve learned that it’ll bring things unexpected that might just become indispensable.

Oh yeah for sure. The point is that it’s difficult to predict how transformative a technology/innovation will be

$2300 - I think it'll take some hits in the build up, and might be in the process of recovering, once he world doesn't end. But it won't have gotten far by then
