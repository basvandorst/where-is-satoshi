But where is SegWit?
While alt coins march on and innovate, Core Developers seem to get very little done.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:10:10
... print some Tether and BTFD.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:58:22
Japan, which erroneously many people think is crypto-friendly, has the same problem. Crypto-to-crypto are taxable events.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:15:29
Exactly. Tether's market cap can't really be compared with other cryptos at all.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:22:21
Yeah, it really sucks here. BTC&lt;-&gt;ALT and ALT&lt;-&gt;ALT are taxable events.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:40:51
When Core decided that Bitcoin is a settlement network. For us peons, the price is the only interesting thing about it at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:53:04
L2 solutions do not work properly under 1MB block size limit. No one is going to pay hundreds of dollars for the privilege of starting a LN channel. Your vision won't make any sense unless BTC price crashes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:32:49
Sadly, salary in bitcoin makes no sense because every purchase becomes a taxable event. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:55:37
When cash is banned and banks refuse to deal with crypto, what happens then?
@_date: 2014-06-07 09:04:13
Well, Finland is not technically part of Scandinavia, but most people outside of Northern Europe consider us Scandinavians, so let me just say that the welfare state and extremely high taxation are ruining this nation. We can't afford it anymore, but we can't wind down the system because way too many people are dependent on it (not only those receiving benefits but also public sector employees). So we just accumulate debt and wait for the bitter end.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:40:10
But is he aware of the block size limit problem?
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:32:35
Gold is valuable because most women absolutely love it and will always do so. Lots of geeks downplay gold because they can not comprehend this.
@_date: 2015-01-03 08:19:14
That 99% of the coins were lost due to 不正操作 (fuseisousa, improper management?).
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:52:55
Yeah, unless BU takes over, they need to bump up the limit again very soon.
@_date: 2016-01-31 15:10:17
Classic seems to have lost steam. I am afraid that bitcoin is going into oblivion, altcoins will take over.
How can a 3 tx/s crippled Bitcoin, with a broken community, fight against alts?
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:57:40
Some users weigh more than others. If businesses such as bitpay decide that Segwit2x is the bitcoin they accept, then what are you going to do? You don't have to run any hard forking code on your Raspberry Pi if you don't want to, but don't be surprised if your node is suddenly no longer connected to the "Bitcoin network".
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:46:13
Core devs! Core devs! Core devs! USA! USA! USA!
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:37:23
Aren't confidential transactions huge? With your beloved 1MB limit  they will be incredibly expensive.
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:35:21
1 MB is too small for all those new Bitcoin millionaires on a buying spree.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:23:35
Deposits are insured up to a very small amount only.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:15:14
Not everyone wants to hodl cryptocurrency because of volatility and possible tax implications.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:20:01
They are real people but stuck in the past.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:24:20
Pension funds etc who are basically obliged to do.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:12:06
Eventually the block reward will dry out, so to keep the network secure high fees are needed. Increasing the block size would be just kicking the can down the road, because sooner or later congestion is necessary.
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:33:25
Exactly. Some people still don't get it though
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:08:50
What accelerating adoption? The network is congested and  can't handle any more people.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:08:40
And opening/closing those channels will be MUCH cheaper and faster. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:28:59
Where is BTG traded currently?
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:46:44
There's too much hostility on both sides.
@_date: 2016-02-01 09:58:14
Did you remember to tell him the truth about full blocks &amp; RBF?
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:23:52
Hopefully transaction fees don't rise too much... it's hard for bitcoin to succeed in developing countries if a transaction fee buys you a meal.
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:06:13
This is why crypto is doomed to fail unless we can build an economy where you can directly spend crypto to buy things.
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:25:11
Nope. For example in Finland you need to be able to speak the language which is super difficult.
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:26:23
How is this bad for Bitcoin Cash or even related with it?
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:06:39
It's a sad day for bitcoin. 1MB4EVA lunatics have totally taken over the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:57:22
I'm just worried that banks will be super suspicious when transacting fiat with Binance. I'm afraid lots of accounts are going to get frozen.
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:25:20
Bitcoin crippled at 1MB can only help select few Venezuelans.
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:37:48
Japan could be the first country where central bank buys bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:44:56
No! When price goes to 20k, most will be looking forward to 100k!
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:19:26
Most rbtc people have probably invested in altcoins and enjoying far greater profits than you.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:37:13
I don't think this is true. It is treated as currency, but as far as I know, only JPY is legal tender.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:57:33
You have no evidence he didn't do that. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:19:03
SegWit + 2MB please, ASAP.
@_date: 2015-02-26 06:29:35
Timing could always be better, you're always at loss if you compare against some perfectly timed transactions. If you believe in bitcoin long term, but have no idea how markets works short term, then it makes sense to keep accumulating even if it means "loss". I put the quotation marks because nothing has been actually lost unless you sell at loss.
I would welcome a big drop in price. Then I could accumulate even more (my dream is 100 BTC and unless the price drops I will probably never reach that). Wouldn't mind about your loss perspective at all.
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:30:38
For a university student that's a lot of money. And btc is going to be much more expensive once today's college kids graduate. Getting to the 1 million club is a challenging task for most youngsters.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:20:01
Bitcoin can succeed but it will never replace gold. You don't make women happy by sending bits to their wallets, you buy them gold. Gold is valuable and will always be because it buys pussy.
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:12:05
Any idea how quickly Schnorr could be activated if segwit activates? 
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:02:18
You're way too invested in Bitcoin if you need to sell most of your coins to pay our bills. What would you do if Bitcoin crashed really bad?
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:15:05
But what if he is a big blocker?
@_date: 2019-05-06 06:24:11
\&gt; If Bitcoin succeeds, the gold market capitalization is a starter
Gold has thousands of years of history as store of value. Calling it a starter is ridiculous.
