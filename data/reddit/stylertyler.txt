People who say they are here for the tech can sit the f down. It’s highly unlikely that we’ll see any changes in the monetary system in our lifetime. Maybe our great grand children will. Sure we want the tech to grow for future generations but we want to make money (USD, euro, etc) in the process and we want it now.

I bought when it was 8k and it went down. I bought even more a couple of weeks ago to average down. I wouldn’t buy now regardless but that’s just me. I’ll probably even sell. Market looks unhealthy and highly manipulated recently.

You buy it goes down, sell and it goes up like it’s some kind of goddamn joke.

Don’t kid yourself. Nobody (investor) gives a rat ass about the technology. Everybody is in it for the gains.

That’s 10 pm CEST. I think I won’t have any more hair on my head or nails on my fingers by then.

Thanks for the info. I had some buying orders placed as the price goes down but maybe it’s better to wait a few hours or days before buying anything so I can get it at the lowest?

I really want to believe you specially that I put most of my savings in BTC right now

Depends on where you are. In Europe I’d argue that kraken is the best exchange. Very fast wire transfers and low transaction fees.

When do the contracts end?

2037 for me

I swear on my little guinea pig’s grave  if you send me 10 bitcoins I’ll return them to you + 12% interest.

Wishful thinking. If everyone is predicting a bull run, there won’t be a bull run.
