From this Q seems that your mind is really confused about what really is MONEY.  
Fiat currency = [IOUs, worthless goat shit](  
Paypal = just another way for financial surveillance, nothing about money  
Bitcoin = REAL MONEY  
So you should think again when you are giving away real money for shit "promise of value" (not money).  
Start using your BTC to buy what you need and NEVER go back to fiat shit.

I do not look at all at the "today's price". Why? Because in 2012 also I never looked at the BTC price when I was buying every fucking week 1 BTC@ $30... with beer money.  
Think about like this: what you buy today  you spend in 6-10months  what you buy tomorrow @ 4k you will spend in 3 years @ 25k and so on.  
Never look at the short period price, look into the future, BTC price will always exponentially grow because the fiat is just... dying.  
I am paid in BTC. ONLY. I do not accept anymore fiat. I have lots of BTC from previous years, I really do not care how much is today or tomorrow. My goal is to FUCK THE BANKSTERS not to make shitloads of profits in [worthless goat shit fiat](

Yes, I am a freelancer and all my income is ONLY in BTC for years.  
It's quite simple: just do your usual invoice, in your fiat currency, but put on the footnote: payment with Bitcoin at the address xxxxx (QR code and BTC address, always a new one).  
People should understand, for the time being, there is no any change in your usual billing. Is just the payment done in BTC, at the rate you decide.  
As a freelancer, I would strongly recommend also to use Bitwage.com, if your client still doesn't have BTC. You just give them your bank details from your Bitwage account, they send as normal fiat currency and you receive straight to your wallet BTC.  
Gradually convince your clients to accept BTC and pay your invoices in BTC. I did that and now everybody is happy.

I hope that Samourai wallet devs finally will make it available to use without internet connection. So I can do this when I do not have any internet connection but only SMS available:  
1. Open Samourai wallet  
2. Create sending tx  
3. Save tx broadcast hex/QR code  
4. Send the broadcast hex/QR code to a friend/family by SMS  
5. They will take that code and paste it into their Samourai wallet  
6. Send the tx for me, without need of my private keys or wallet access.  
But right now you can't do that because you can't open Samourai wallet app without internet. Yes, you can do it with Electrum wallet, but not sure if the mobile version have the ability to save a tx in hex or QR code so you can send it by SMS to somebody else.  
I hope Samourai devs will hear this cry for feature request...

r/LivingOnBitcoin  
Many readers here are coming to r/Bitcoin thinking that is a source of info for the next BTC price/trading/shit like that.  
They're wrong, Bitcoin is NOT only that is far more than that.  
Additional info on your question: I **always** shapeshift my BTC incomes. I do not want that anybody (including the payer) to trace my BTC expenses/addresses. So I do a simple "cleanup". Split the income amount into 3-4-5 txs/amounts, shapeshift them into some altcoins (XMR/LTC), then back to BTC to 5-6 new addresses.

Yes, all txs are already on the blockchain, public, but nobody knows or can link a tx to a real ID. Bloconomics can do that because already have users registered.  
Bloconomics CAN'T give any insurance that those logs will not be also known by "anybody" else. And this will not make any difference between Paypal and Bloconomics... There are already many blockchain scanners, Bloconomics is just helping them. **I do not want to help them in any way, even if I do not do any illegal stuff! I just want my privacy right back. Bitcoins stands for privacy! We should use it for privacy.**  
I am tired to hear this pathetic excuse "ok, if you want decentralization from BTCpay and others, do yourself, bla bla bla". Do the right thing for Bitcoin, why you didn't built a plugin that is really decentralized and NOBODY can track, monitor, link to ID any tx. Do a better BTCPay if you are so afraid of. Why everything have to be monitored, watched, tracked, registered? Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy! **Bloconomics is just undoing what Bitcoin is trying hard to do: give to the people their privacy back.**  


Those are NOT "solutions" are just another ways to **control** Bitcoin. We already know the game. We will not fall into this trap again.  


LOLOLOL privacy? When you know my IP, ID, real name, email etc and link them to my BTC txs? That you name privacy? Oh man, you are so wrong... You are just another Conbase...

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can't be debited on a card. Any of these so called ["bitcoin cards"]( are the ultimate banksters trick to fool you again by using their worthless goat shit fiat instead of your BTC directly.  
By selling your BTC in order to debit that card **with fiat** (not BTC) you just making the banksters game: keep you using their shit fake money!  
Use your BTC directly to buy stuff if the seller accept it. Other wise just use your shity visa fiat card (if you still use that shit).

1. both  
2. Not sure what means that question? I work, the client pays the bill in BTC @ the current rate  
3. the amount in $$ @ payment date rate exchange  
4. yes. I convinced the director of the company that I work for to pay me in BTC. First, we used Bitwage.com (they make usual bank transfer for may wage to my Bitwage account, I receive directly BTC into my wallet). Then after some months the company start buying BTC as reserve currency. Then they start accepting BTC for their products/services. Now the company pays in BTC at least other 4 employees.

Is not about the gateways risk. In the end is a BTC payment that can't be reversed. So for the merchant there is no risk at all. Is all about privacy. Until BTC came across, we were heavily bombarded with monitoring, tracking, seizing etc of our money movement. Most of people think that financial privacy = money laundering. **This is so wrong thinking!** Financial privacy is one of your most important privacy in this world of super surveillance.

Why not using BTCPay instead of any other 3rd party intermediary that Bitcoin is just trying to avoid them at all.  
As a Bitcoin lover/user you should know the definition of Bitcoin. Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Using BTC on your online shop through another intermediary **IT IS NOT** adoption of Bitcoin. Is just another payment processing by a gateway.
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:51:33

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
Blockonimics is NOT what Bitcoin stands for. All txs, logs, IPs, and many other things can be crawled by that plugin and who knows who else get their hands on. All these "payment gateways" work as a surveillance gateway.

Just put your BTC address for those who want to pay in BTC. Or install BTCPay plugin for receiving BTC payments.  
Those who have BTc will pay with BTC.  
Those who have fiat will pay as usual with visa/bank/paypal/shit.  
Using an intermediary (Bitpay and Conbase) for taking BTC payments is violating the definition of Bitcoin.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitcoin was created exactly to avoid these intermediaries and use your own power of your own BTC wallet. Any intermediary of a BTC payment is suspicious to be a gov/banksters tool for tracking, registering, monitoring all txs and even worse to identify/map any real ID with BTC addresses.

**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Savings in BTC?! That's just for the weak...

Bitcoin is more than just "savings", it is your freaking FREEDOM, freedom from debt, freedom from the banksters, freedom from tyrannical govs, pure freedom.  
**And freedom is priceless...**  
When you use and "save" fiat money, you live in fear and uncertainty, anytime from now you can have NOTHING.  
When you use and HODL BTC, you live fearless and you have secured your future and your children's future.  
Using today BTC as money, not only you fucked up the banksters, but you also force your gov to not spend your money on wars &amp; bombs &amp; corruption.  
People should always remember this great funny video: [BTC HODLers vs fiat  savers](

Nice work. But you should not put stars/opinions/ratings. Are very dangerous and misleading and never will reflect the reality. Is hard to do that.  
If you let people to post comments you can't protect from the shills or ad pushers. You can't filter the real honest comments/rates by the shills.  
So better make it like just a list with explanatory features and leave it there, so the user will decide for his own which is better for each.  
An example? If you post all these true complaints about Coinbase, in the end you will have to remove it from the list, because right now you put CB with high star favorite, when should not be.  
But anyway, I am glad you did that huge work and make a nice page with almost all exchanges and features. Now new comers can see that doesn't exist only CB on this planet :)

Yes we need many BTC marketplaces, many as possible. At local level, at regional level, state level.  
People should start going back to roots. Grow their own food, or sell it locally. Not like we are used to have kiwis from S.America, to EU and peppers from Italy to S.America) The actual way of trading is total chaotic and using huge resources.  
Open Bazaar, spendabit.co, coinmap.org and some more are making a great service to BTC. We need more services like these. Also convince many merchants to put their ads on these marketplaces, spread the word. P2P and decentralized are also a great tool to not depend of central friction points, where evil govs can interact.  
For a P2P decentralized currency (Bitcoin) we need p2p decentralized marketplaces, exchanges, lending platforms etc. This is the way we have to go forward.  
If you need my help building a BTC marketplace, I would be glad yo give as much as I can information.

Why people always says it's a crash? It is not, if you just view from a larger perspective, Bitcoin always was going up, slowly slowly. But yes people are going to calculate from the last big speculation the crashes.  
We are back to the normal price guys.  
If BTC will go to $1 then yes, we can consider it a crash. Otherwise is just a correction price to cut the speculators.  
Wake up people do not fall into the "trading" trap. [As I explain it here](

Bitpay became the enemy of Bitcoin when they started the S2X fork, with the real intention of censoring all txs.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

I really do not understand why people are so masochist and still using Conbase?  
There are so many DEX now like Bisq that will never held any amount of YOUR money.  
Or just fucking work for BTC (being paid in BTC). Problem solved - no need to buy anymore BTC. Just live on BTC.  
The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.

Ah yes, they are, because they use "regulated" exchanges, hahahaha. There are so many ways to get BTC, but yes let them be convinced that can link a BTC address (from the infinite addresses) with a person. What if is a self driving taxi the owner of that address? Is that taxi car a terrorist? Oh yeah is a fucking jihadist that will plunge into a crowd. Geeze now we can have jihadi suicidal taxi cars! LOL

If you think to dump immediately the BTC you just earned, why you take them in the first place? This is the dumbest move ever.  
Pay your employees and bills in BTC if you really have to rely on those BTC earnings. There are many ways to do it.  
I am paid only in BTC from years ago and I will never accept anymore fiat for my work. I am 1000% sure that are many people here happy to be paid in BTC.  
You are complaining about corrupt industry but yet you go back to using their corrupt fiat system. Doesn't make any sense.   
Throwing away the most valuable currency on Earth is a stupid thing. Stay with the fucking fiat if you don't believe that, you will cry later.

* Satoshi Nakamoto stole from the banks the power to create money and give it to the people. Like Prometheus giving the ability to make fire from the gods to mankind.  
* Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.  
* Bitcoin will do to banks what email did to the postal industry.  
* Economists and journalists often get caught up in this question: Why does Bitcoin have value? And the answer is very easy. Because it is useful and scarce.  
* Bitcoin is not the money of the current generation. It is the money of generations to come.  
* Privacy is a human right and secrecy is a privilege of power.  
* Government say they are worried that criminals will use bitcoin. In truth, they are terrified that all the rest of us will.  
* Bitcoin doesn’t just disrupt money. It also disrupts the models of modern corporations, macro-economics, nation-states and the Internet.  
* Credit cards are a “pull” model: You surrender the keys to your money, and they pull money from you. Bitcoin is a push model; more secure.  
The first years on the Internet, we got access DESPITE telecom companies, not through them. Now, bitcoin works despite banks, not with them.  
* In many countries around the world, if a government bans bitcoin it will instantly be more credible as an alternative choice.  
* Price is a leading indicator for media attention of Bitcoin and eventual adoption by users.  
* If you want to understand Bitcoin, read the original paper instead of other people’s interpretations of it   
* Bitcoin allows the free market of ideas being flooded with innovation without the need to ask for permission.  
* Bitcoin is even bulletproof against time-travelers. No one can go back in time and bring a lot of coins to or from future.  
All these are Andreas A. quotes.  
* Bitcoin must be doing really good as so many people are trying to make it fail.

Use the Trezor seed words into Electrum wallet. It worked fine for me.  
A fucking reminder for all newbies: **before adding more funds into your wallet, ALWAYS test your recovery seed!** Not only into your original wallet app/device but also into a "backup" app/device. Just to see how it works and IF it works OK. Do this regularly and many times until you get used to. Me personally I have remembered at least 2 seed wallets. Train your mind to do that.

No sorry I am not considering me a "maximalist" I am just a Bitcoin user that is really pissed off with all these banksters and their manipulations.  
Yes maybe Brian and devs of Coinbase are great guys, but knowing that are funded and manipulated by the banksters doesn't take them out from guilty. If they still have balls and spine they can come up and say clearly that will not be part anymore of that banksters company and will move to another one or whatever they want to do. But yes... money talks and is damn good to have you back protected by a bankster.  
But they still continue with hypocrisy saying that they do everything they can for Bitcoin, when in fact they just doing masters plan, against Bitcoin.  
Move out from that Coinbase and earn respect from all bitcoiners!

Move from USnazi... or get a friend to buy for you from EU exchanges.  
Bitsquare is a real P2P decentralized exchange and that gives you more privacy and control of your money. Convenience and speed for security and privacy...  
Try with CCs:  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - buy from local stores in US  
  
 - cash or cards in almost all countries  
  
 - BTC with CC

I think Supload is doing a great job to support Bitcoin and this type of services should be adopted by many, including wallets. Sharing the ads incentives is good for all participants and is a fair thing to do.  
Reddit doesn't like it because they are greedy and they don't get a share from Imgur, that is also greedy and do not want to share with participants.

Do you really think here is r/HMRC? Why do you think we will do their stupid job?  
[Here is the best answer for you](  
Taxes never was designed to help the poor and welfare, but to fund wars and corruption. I disobey to fund those with my money.  
Just few examples here:  
- lost [9 trillions from FED]( (also our taxes)  
- lost another 6.5 trillions in [military funding](  
- lost track of [Irak war billions](  
- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [all taxes goes to military complex]( - how many roads, hospitals, schools etc can be built with these trillions?    
- pay taxes to [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](  
- pay taxes so [Pentagon can just spend $128 billions on submarines](  
[- pay taxes so the gov can tax me rain water and ponds on my property?](  
- pay taxes to build railroads [that later GM dismantle them to push their agenda of heavy use of cars](  
This list is even larger than you can imagine.  
And people still pay taxes like nothing happen, thinking that is for "common good"...  
Enough is enough, **fuck this shit**, with my btc will never fund a war or corrupt politician.

When you have unlimited fiat supply (banksters) you don't care about profits, so you can "play" a bit to fuck the BTC market and diminish the trust in Bitcoin.  
Banksters care about **control** not about profits... and Bitcoin is destroying their monopoly of control. That's why they will do everything to slow down Bitcoin until they will come up with their fedcoin - the total control of humanity.  
But yes, the early adopters and real bitcoiners, doesn't give a fuck about their price manipulations, because they know that Bitcoin is [the motherfucker Honey Badger](
@_date: 2017-01-11 14:45:15
Decentralization is the key to everything.  
Concentrating all the buys on few exchanges is not good, for BTC and also for the users.  
Spreading the volume across many exchanges will make more difficult to manipulate the market price.  
What we see today is a huge manipulation of the market, by the banksters, pushing govs from behind.  
**This is a banksters manipulation to bring down the faith in Bitcoin**  
China and other countries was pushing cheap/free fiat credits to the people, for long time. People start hearing about BTC and make the deal: took the credit and buy BTC. But now the banksters watching the price, let it to reach another high times level they will just start a huge campaign against big exchanges. So small fishes entered in panic mode and start selling BTC. Others follow into the fall trap because they can't HODL too much. So the big sharks now come and get all, banksters retreat, gov will not do too much to exchanges (actually they can't do too much), price will stabilize to 600-700 and life goes on.  
Who wins? Banksters and big sharks. Who lose? PEOPLE, normal people that ignored the warnings and start trading their savings, thinking that they will get rich quick.  
Why this is possible? Because we have mass concentration in few exchanges. If we would use more P2P exchanges, like bitsquare.io or bitcoin.de for example, this will never happen. The volume is only limited and is only for people's needs, is not feeding their greed. Small loses will be. That's normal.  
**Remember: all big exchanges ARE MANIPULATED**.   
If people really want to earn something, then buy BTC, use it as money, then buy back +10% always. Never sell for profit, sell if you really need fiat. Dumping the use of fiat, will crush the banksters and will make Bitcoin stronger. They can't stop this, but they can slow down the adoption by crushing the price. Until they will come up with their fucking fedcoin... and then the world as we know it is done. Forever doomed.  
Mark my words! We have to fight this by using Bitcoin!

Please do not consider Bitcoin as "investment" like shares, stocks, bonds etc. It is the the biggest mistake people are doing by that. Bitcoin is MONEY and currency (to be trade also) in the same time.  
Those who start by using it as money, they will discover that they no longer have to be the fiat/banksters slaves.  
Bitcoin is the future of money, not future of shares. When BTC will be $5000 NOBODY will use anymore fiat because will be worthless. The value of BTC in fiat will be just a reminiscence of the past, but everything will be traded in BTC.

I think Abra will do exactly like Circle: will use Bitcoin to attract (fool) new more customers into their new platform and once that, they will dump BTC and/or replace it with their own shitcoin.  
Everybody should ask first "qui bono?" from a platform like that? The users? Bitcoin? Abra? "3rd party/secret party"?  
In this fucking world the key is to **control** the masses.  
Yeah yeah will see many here that will jump to say I am crazy fuck conspirator, but always my "not trust" feelings are right.

Yes I know about AXA, but don't try to move the attention/subject to another direction. I don't give a shit about what regulations and shit Coinbase have to follow. I am pissed off because people see Coinbase the only way to buy BTC when is NOT.  
Those devs of Coinbase, instead of working for the banksters from BBVA, why they didn't start their own company, crowdfunded or whatever funding but not banksters, for a P2P decentralized exchange, like Bitsquare. So then people will not be "forced" to use only Coinbase.  
I will be glad to have many decentralized exchanges like Bitsquare all over the world and fuck all those stupid regulations.  
If Brian and his devs have balls and spine will do that and everybody will salute them and glad to pay fees to use their decentralized exchange. That I want to see from a real Bitcoin supporter.

I don't use any one to buy BTC. Because I earn BTC, so no need for me anymore to buy. All my income is in BTC, all outcome is in BTC. I hodl what remains. From 2015 I closed all my bank accounts and from now on my real money is Bitcoin.  
All those, some of them I use them in the past (until 2015, when I start living on BTC), some of them was recommended by others, here or in other places and I save the list.  
Originally the list was way longer, like  but in time I removed one by one those who was susceptible of fraud, scam, laziness, no support etc.  
**This is a warning for all those who are still on this list! We do not make any exception. If we find 1 or more bad issues with your services, we will no longer "recommend" your websites!**  
In Bitcoinlandia we can't afford to trust just because you are nice in the beginning. Do your job a helpful job for Bitcoin not just for you.  
Now to come back to your question (sorry for rant)...  
Moving around I would suggest to look into:  
Mycelium wallet - buy in feature with cards, local trader, Glidera exchange (US&amp;CA)  
Airbitz wallet - buy in featuire with cards, Glidera exchange  
BC.i wallet - buy in feature with cards, but for the moment only for EU as I understand  
Chip-Chap wallet app - buy in with cards  
As I said in the list:  - P2P decentralized exchange, strongly recommended - for a decentralized currency is better to use also a decentralized exchange. Many would say that doesn't have volume. Are right, but the volume come with every user that put an offer there. It is P2P buy/sell not HFT!  
As far some friends from CA told me also these are good for you:  
 - buy from local stores in US  
 - instant buy with cards and vouchers
 - instant buy with cards and vouchers
 - buy instant with debit, cash, flexepinin CA  
My real personal recommendation: start working for bitcoins, start by receiving your wage with bitwage.com

Some sites like coindesk are just price index, not real trading. So they make an average.  
To buy and HODL I strongly suggest bitsquare.io - P2P decentralized exchange. That one will never trace your identity or store in a database for "later use". Many of those who bought from "regulated" exchanges maybe they will have some "consequences" later.  
I always warn about privacy here, but people ignore me because they want fast money/profits. They will regret it later.  
Our financial privacy is crucial. Is like freedom of speech.

We don't need more services, we need those that already exist to work better. Wallets, exchanges, POS, merchant apps, bill payments, remittances etc all these need to be improved.  
Not talking about the whole Bitcoin protocol that is falling apart if is not going to be fixed soon. The astronomical fees, mining empty blocks with rewards, miners pushing high fees, txs errors, easiness in use for noobs etc. This is where new devs have to concentrate not into stupid useless apps.  
Make the protocol and wallets to work perfect and then all together focus on new boundaries and apps.

Yeah USnazi... in EUnazi the situation is different...  people are waking up faster than USnazi :)  
What people should understand is that Bitsquare is NOT for trading or making profit from buy/sell BTC.  
Bitsquare is a damn P2P decentralized exchange. I think people do not understand these terms. P2P means that if there is no other person on the other side of the trade, NOBODY wants your fiat.  
You are too used to have a large volume like in other exchanges, but you don't know if that volume is real or is fake, created by an algorithm, bots or even the exchange itself.  
For fuck sake, understand this term P2P, is person to person for REAL! All volume is REAL in there, real people waiting with his order.    
Bitsquare is just an interface for people that want to buy or sell their cryptos in a free, decentralized way. Bitsquare is a "baby", not even 1 year old.

I will tell you my case. There are others like me here. Not many.  
I live on BTC from 2015. I closed all my bank accounts. I am paid for my work in BTC, I spend in BTC for my regular expenses, bills, rent etc. I save/hodl what remains.  
But I started in 2012 by buying 30BTC @ $15 from a fiend, miner. Then more 50BTC in few weeks, when I realized what really is Bitcoin. From that moment I never stopped buying, never sell, never had the intention to sell. I knew that Bitcoin will be the future so no worth selling to get rich quick with what? With fiat? No way!"  
In 2013 I start mining too, GPUs, USBs, cloud anything I could. Meanwhile also buying anytime I had some fiat available, at any price. It was like a crazy race. And still is for me.  
2014 started to be bad year for mining so I remained only with some cloud contracts GHS. Just change. So I decided to start pushing to be paid for my work (freelancing) in BTC.  
Also I started to spend in BTC some, but buying back what I "lost" +10%. But never sell for profit or greed. Never.  
Then from 2015 I won. My cleints started to pay my invoices with BTC, my landlord accepted my BTC, local grocery started to accept my BTC and also from my landlord :) and so on.  
So yes in general now I spend what I earn (not buy) and remain with a small amount to hodl. But I still have large stash from my previous buy/mine, lots, lots.... :)  
NEVER SELL! NEVER EVER!

When, in the entire history of humanity, the government was helping his slaves?  
The first government that will try to do that, the banksters will destroy that gov and will replace it with another puppet.  
Understand that for fuck sake: govs are not to help you to live free and in prosperity. Is to enslave you for your entire life, you and your 3 or more generations descendants. And that's because the bankster behind the gov is pulling the strings.  
That's why Bitcoin was created: to get rid of banksters. But still people do not want to understand that and continue "trading" BTC, instead of just using it like money.  
[As I explain it here]( banksters will not let Bitcoin to win. We have to fight and use BTC as money otherwise the whole game is over.

Blah blah blah, nothing will change.  
The whole US legal system is putrid. USnazi is a tyranny.  
When US people will wake up and change the fucking system? They wait 300 years for another revolution?  
When you will understand that the whole "drama" of CB-IRS is a well planned operation from long time ago.  
One simple question: Why IRS goes ONLY to CB and not also to all exchanges from US?  
The answer is simple: [banksters created/funded/controlled Coinbase from the beginning]( then they attract as many they can users (losers), track them, learn their way to use BTC, habits, etc, make connections between wallets/persons, create a huge database of these connections and then call the new outsourced customer service (aka IRS) to clean the mess and make so called "inspection", but in fact they already have that information about users.  
Just few aspects to remember:  
    
  
  
That means CB is always "sharing" the users info with "3rd parties"...

You don't need to be tech savy to store safe your wallets. You need just not to be so stupid to store your bitcoins in a custodial wallet. But yeah, people usually prefer to be stupid than safe.  
Feel safe when those custodial wallets will close your access to your account. That will not help you in any way if the service provider is "regulated" or not. Bitcoin was designed EXACTLY against these "regulated" vultures that work for the gov not for you, the customer.

[Please watch this video together with your father.](  
I am not discouraging your to buy BTC. Is a good thing but your approach ("to invest in BTC") is bad thinking.  
You are young and you are the future like Bitcoin too. Start learning more about Bitcoin, start doing something with Bitcoin, work for bitcoins. If those 10k are money that you don't depend on them today, yes buy 10BTC and forget about them few years. But remember: **if you see that the price is dropping, DO NOT SELL THEM!** That is the biggest error you can do.  
The idea o buying BTC to sell them later is WRONG! The idea is to buy them to have them later, to buy stuff with them or live with them (like me, I live on BTC from 2015).  
But my advice remain: buy the, secure them in a Trezor and "forget" about them for few years. Meanwhile start learning more and work for bitcoins. The future of those BTC you bought depends only on you.

What you refuse to understand? The future is **DECENTRALIZATION**,  for a P2P decentralized currency we need to use also P2P decentralized exchanges. Otherwise we go back to centralization where govs and banksters fuckers will squeeze us.  
For the moment we have only this Bitsquare, but I am really sure that soon will be more exchanges like this.  
Putting your info and money in a centralized point is not an option anymore.  
A P2P decentralized exchange will never be subject of market manipulation, like we see many times before.  
Can you be 100% sure that the volume in a standard "regulated" exchange is REAL? You never think about that can be bots, fake orders, by the exchanges themselves, to attract more users (more fees) and manipulate the price market? Just think about it.  
In a P2P exchange is really hard to achieve that.  
Govs love that people are using "regulated" exchanges, where they can push their politics and manipulations. Just few days ago PBOC did it. Those exchanges are exactly what they want: point of control and tracking.  
Now you will come to say, ok but also on Bitsquare, somebody from  feds can put an order to catch your bank account. Ok they can do it, but in that way, first they need to buy the BTC, then how many orders they have to put (for real) to be able to catch some bank accounts? Is a hard process that will not give so much result like a "regulated" exchange that is giving in real time all the accounts IDs/accounts, traffic etc (eg. Coinbase).

What you will do in that case. Yeah you will come up with the BS "this will never happen in my country". I have news for you: that is going to happen everywhere soon. Nothing si more safe then keep your money with you. And a Trezor with some kb in it is enough to carry millions.

Let's be clear: Bitcoin is not a tax avoiding scheme or fiscal heaven.  
Bitcoin is to ELIMINATE  the forced taxation (aka slavery)!  
So until Bitcoin will be largely adopted and start kicking out politicians, we have to play their slavery game. But that doesn't mean we will pay all the fucking taxes that fund the wars.  
But also we don't have to give to govs too much information about how we will fuck them. In special reddit is not the place to do that. This reddit is watched 24/7 by govs agents! Let them do their job in finding nothing or bang their heads to the wall.

There are many types of paranoia :)  
I will tell you my "paranoia":  
- I have more than 50BTC in 2-3 wallets  
- created with Tails OS/Electrum (one time boot, offline)  
- Saved the seed on a paper  
- Sent some small amount of BTC to the wallet/checked on blockchain the balance if the wallet is OK  
- boot again with Tails OS/Electrum, restore the seed, check the balance  
- continue to sent the large amount of BTC to your wallet.  
If all OK, save that seed in:  
- encrypted file. Never online password manager, or at least an offline password manager  
- just the paper with QR code or seed. You can hide the seed in a nice text letter and save it somewhere safe, with digital scan copies. Those digital files can be stored on different places (encrypted USBs, NAS, Storj.io, buried in your backyard)  
- hidden in plain sight, steganography encryption can do a great job  
- I have a nice picture with hidden seed inside, that is published on a website like a regular picture (with backups on many other websites). The same picture can be my screensaver also :) Not even my wife knows that the picture have 10BTC inside.

STOP promoting Bitpay and Coinbase! They are the biggest enemies of Bitcoin (disguised in Bitcoin companies)!  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Me as many others here like early adopters, that we start by mining with CPU/GPU/USB we will love to restart our parked mining rigs.  
I will not say more than this. you know the rest.... life goes on normally or even better.  
That's why Bitcoin is decentralized, to be able to adapt in cases like these. But I really don't think any gov will shut down any mining facility in China or anywhere in the world. If they pay their electricity contracts the govs are happy.

Nothing online is safe. And that wallet in particular doesn't offer 100% control of your keys.  
Any online wallet is doomed to have a central access that any time can be blocked, seized, not available, hacked etc.  
Use your own BTC wallet, that offers you more flexibility in saving your keys, seeds, access.  
Any online wallet is a bank. Simple like that. Doesn't make sense to have secured your wallet in a bank that can close the access to your wallet any time.  
That is not security, that is giving away your money.

Is not about "hiding" how much you receive, is about to lose track of those who donate.  
If you want a nice easy way - use the Pro version  
If you want to do it yourself, shapeshift them.  
The thing is that you have to calculate the costs: how much you will pay for the Pro version and how much can be the shapeshifting.  
Me personally I am fan of both options. I am not an affiliate or creator of the plugin. I just use it and I like it because it's simple and works as it says.
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:15:32
not only the IP is important, but also the other factors: reuse of address, link your real ID with an address.  
Bitcoin is fully transparent, but privacy is a matter of the user and he's the only one that can do it in the right way.  
If Bitcoin protocol will have privacy features built in but the user is linking all his addresses to a real name (aka using a wallet like Conbase) then all privacy features are for nothing.

The bitcoins already bought from Coinbase I suggest to shapeshift them.  
Shapeshifting = exchange them into altcoins and then back to bitcoins, to new created BTC addresses, spread the amount. Watch the altcoins market and when you see the advantage price, execute. I saw a pattern: when BTC is rising, altcoins going down, when BTC is going down, altcoins going up (not too much, but still).

Is not about paying a "premium". Is about exiting from the fucking fiat with any cost.  
I closed all my bank accounts in 2015 and live only with BTC, but not because is cheaper, but because I am done with the fucking banksters! Even if I would became broke (I doubt it, I have lots of BTC) I will continue NOT to use in any way the fucking worthless goat shit fiat!  
I don't care if the price will fuck me in one month, I will recover in the next one or I will just use from my BTC stash bought/mined in 2012-2014. I care to use ONLY BTC because I know that in that way I am part of this big fucking Bitcoin Revolution. When my grandchildren will ask me how was about that fiat disappear, I would be proud to tell them that their grandpa was one of the first pioneers and fighters against the evil banksters and fiat. **That is the future we are building now** not dodging taxes, cheap fees or getting rich schemes. **We build the future of our next generations** and only by dumping the fiat we can survive.

As I said many times before: Circle was never a "bitcoin company", it was a banksters tool (Goldman Sachs) like Coinbase and others. Let's be clear guys: the banksters are creating traps fro you, to fool you, to study your moves, to track you etc when you are using BTC through a centralized way (their funded "exchanges").  
Stop using their tools: fiat and centralized exchanges and you will see how their house of cards will collapse rapidly.  
But yet people ignore the warnings and continue to use the wrong services and even believe in them that made a good thing for Bitcoin! [But yeah like George Carlin said...](
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:15:17
Because I don't know anything about the other ones.  
Guys please, this is NOT a ad promoting list for bitcoin companies, don't start here a "war" why you put that and not the other one.  
**This is a list I built it myself during the last years (I am here from 2012). I was reading all others posts, bad or good about places where to buy/sell BTC, merchants, services, everything related to BTC and I save them in my personal list of favs.  
Once somebody was asking about a service I just post what others recommend.  
Of course during these years I was aware to remove those that are not good.  
Please, if you have used a bitcoin service, post your own experience here, in a nice way, explaining how was your experience, bad and/o good aspects of that service.  
We appreciate all these good stuff when a user is testing a new service.  
Like u/benperrin117 is doing with his all BTC Sessions videos.  
Please understand (DISCLAIMER), I am not paid or work for any of those companies from that list. Many of them are already included in the link on right panel -----&gt; "How to buy Bitcoin". I am posting that list so new people can have a start that was already filtered, but each of of you should make your own decision.

All the BTC I mined I never sell them. I use some to buy stuff but I never wanted to sell them for fiat.  
Yes until 2015 I used bank accounts to buy BTC, but I always shapeshifted them.  
I am not saying that now everybody should dump tomorrow their bank accounts. **This process is NOT EASY**. For me took 2 years to prepare me and take the decision to go full BTC. But that was back in 2013-2014. Nowadays things are much easier. Each one should evaluate his options and take it easy, but never despair or stop focusing on the final goal.  
I do not want to encourage people here to do like me. But I want to give them hope and an example, that it is possible if they want.

They can "regulate" the way people will aquire BTC but not the usage. That can never be stopped. Yes in some parts of the world we will see an increased volume in smuggling BTC and they will make it worst.

There is no "best" wallet. There are only 2 categories: those who respect the [Golden rule of Bitcoin]( and those who don't. Each wallet have his own features, functionalities that each user can find it useful for him. I use many wallets, each one for a specific reason/usage.

I am living ONLY with BTC from 2015 and many merchants in my area are happy to take my BTC. It's all about how you convince them to take BTC, don't just wait an complain. It's all about you how to find a way to pay with BTC. Be smart, be inventive.

Stability start by people using BTC as money and not getting crazy with "trading" and ask on reddit "how can I get rich trading BTC".  
If we start slowly, one by one, using BTC as money there will be stability.  
If we think about BTC to be just as stocks, shares and bonds, will fail, even like store of value.  
Today the world need real money not controlled by the banksters not another scam gold paper/digital, with prices rigged by the same banksters...

With the 12 words passphrase saved you can open any other HD wallet and use those words to restore your wallet from a lost phone.

Mycelium is great too.  
WP+WC is free, hosting is not, or use own server hosting.  
I used bitcoinway with no problems for couple of years. Those who say that is not good are the ones offering you a "solution" that you will have to pay a fee... Bitcoinway is not charging any fee or at least you buy the pro version with one time payment.  
From coinsimple web:  
"CoinSimple is currently on its beta testing stage and offers its services for free. After the beta stage is over CoinSimple will operate on the subscription model. We will charge our merchants between $30-$300/month based on volume and features and there will always be a free version of the product."

This is not a real help. This is like chemotherapy to a cancer patient. To fight cancer you start with eating healthy.  
So this Bitcoin "cancer" of fees have to be "eradicated" with other measures, from the core, not with patches for temporary solution.  
Allowing the miners to decide which fee is right for their pocket is giving them huge powers, bigger than banksters have.  
These miners powers makes Bitcoin to NOT be anymore permissionless.  
STOP this massive **propaganda** for higher fees, **DO NOT FEED THE FUCKING GREEDY MINERS!**  
Miners demand higher fees meanwhile they are mining empty blocks! You are a fool paying them!  
Bitcoin is for everybody not just for some speculators. **Did you ask what can by in India a 100k satoshi fee?**

Decentralization is the key to everything.  
Concentrating all the buys on few exchanges is not good, for BTC and also for the users.  
Spreading the volume across many exchanges will make more difficult to manipulate the market price.  
What we see today is a huge manipulation of the market, by the banksters, pushing govs from behind.  
**This is a banksters manipulation to bring down the faith in Bitcoin**  
China and other countries was pushing cheap/free fiat credits to the people, for long time. People start hearing about BTC and make the deal: took the credit and buy BTC. But now the banksters watching the price, let it to reach another high times level they will just start a huge campaign against big exchanges. So small fishes entered in panic mode and start selling BTC. Others follow into the fall trap because they can't HODL too much. So the big sharks now come and get all, banksters retreat, gov will not do too much to exchanges (actually they can't do too much), price will stabilize to 600-700 and life goes on.  
Who wins? Banksters and big sharks. Who lose? PEOPLE, normal people that ignored the warnings and start trading their savings, thinking that they will get rich quick, contrary to advice that buy and use/hodl.  
Why this is possible? Because we have mass concentration in few exchanges. If we would use more P2P exchanges, like bitsquare.io or bitcoin.de for example, this will never happen. The volume is only limited and is only for people's needs, is not feeding their greed. Small loses will be. That's normal.  
**Remember: all big exchanges ARE MANIPULATED**.   
If people really want to earn something, then buy BTC, use it as money, then buy back +10% always. Never sell for profit, sell if you really need fiat. Dumping the use of fiat, will crush the banksters and will make Bitcoin stronger. They can't stop this, but they can slow down the adoption by crushing the price. Until they will come up with their fucking fedcoin... and then the world as we know it is done. Forever doomed.  
Mark my words! We have to fight this by using Bitcoin!

Why the hell people want to go back to fiat worthless EUR?!  
Guys! Wake the fuck up! Make "how to" guides about how to pay with BTC, how to get BTC, how to live on BTC not how to go back to fucking fiat!  
You mention the so called ["bitcoin debit cards"]( that are the biggest trap ever created by the banksters!  
Your Bitcoin wallet is YOUR future not going back to fiat. Find ways to use only BTC and make those ways to work.  
This campaign on "how to go back to fiat" is a total crap trap of the banksters to fool you again to use their worthless goat shit fiat lie!  
Buy BTC and spend them ONLY in BTC, never sell them for fiat to buy stuff. You spend them, buy again +10% more...

Any "investing" site is actually a scam. All of them are selling the promise that someday Bitcoin will worth thousands of fiat money.  
Try to take out the idea of "investing" in Bitcoin, it's a trap. Bitcoin is NOT bonds, shares, derivatives shit or something like this.  
Bitcoin is MONEY, simple like that. Start using it like money and dump the fiat. This is the best "investment" in your future. Invest in knowledge not in dreams.  
If you really want to help Bitcoin with your investment, then choose a Bitcoin company that you like and invest in their shares, tokens etc. help them go ahead with their Bitcoin innovation.

The correct way is NBOT to convert at all your BTC into worthless fucking fiat, just pay with BTC and FUCK all the rest!  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy. Wirex in this case is acting as an intermediary, exactly what we want to get rid off!  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

The problem is not with those wallet apps, but with your phone itself.  
A simple case: you get a virus or you just make an update on your phone and is not booting anymore. Your wallets could be fine not compromised but you still can't use them anymore.  
So having an alternative access by desktop/hw wallets is always good to have.  
Also consider the case when your phone is stolen/lost/crashed. Until you could have another phone to restore your wallets could take time. So a desktop/hw wallet is again convenient to have.

[Something like Andreas mentioned some time ago](  
Look into this:   
Personally I don't mind to carry with me 1-2 USB encrypted sticks containing some of my wallets. I usually have those with my regular stuff.  
But I do care if somebody else will have control of MY MONEY. I don't want to be fooled again by "another" banksters. NEVER EVER will let them with my money. NOBODY.  
I will NEVER trust any browser extension and IN SPECIAL from Chrome (Google).  
Bitcoin is decentralized for a reason, not to go back and put it into a central cage (banks/central servers) with a single point of failure/attack.  
How will serve your very well secured wallet on a third part server that suddenly will not give the access to your wallet? Useless. Maybe your wallet is safe but if you can't get to it, is for nothing.

Maybe they don't want to publish their shops on the map because are afraid of their gov.  
I found many shops that are NOT on coinmap.org but in reality they accept BTC. They simply don't want to bring attention... for now.  
Once, few months ago, I entered into a small shop and before buying something I asked if they accept BTC. There was no sign, no nothing visible for that. The cashier said "wait a min" and then the supervisor or owner came up with his tablet and a QR code. I was not even taking the product and wanted to charge me BTC :), but yeah I was very surprised for the excitement on the face of the owner that I asked that. Later he told me that for the moment he doesn't make it so public because he already had some controls from a local gov. Only his friends and people he knows are paying there with BTC. And he said that he was skeptical when I asked, but when he saw my BTC T-shirt with "May The Coin Be With You" and the B sign, we came up with the tablet.  
So guys, dig deep, there are many but seems that now we are paying with "smuggling" money because we have govs that are "taking care" of us and protect us to NOT be free...

Taxes never was designed to help the poor and welfare, but to fund wars and corruption. I disobey to fund those with my money.  
Just few examples here:  
- lost [9 trillions from FED]( (also our taxes)  
- lost another 6.5 trillions in [military funding](  
- lost track of [Irak war billions](  
- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [all taxes goes to military complex]( - how many roads, hospitals, schools etc can be built with these trillions?    
- pay taxes to [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](  
[- pay taxes so the gov can tax me rain water and ponds on my property?](  
- pay taxes to build railroads [that later GM dismantle them to push their agenda of heavy use of cars](  
This list is even larger than you can imagine.

2. Buttcoiners. [Simply give them this answer](  
3. Simply sheeple trying to wake up but too lazy to read something about Bitcoin before asking stupid questions. We have here every Monday the moronic day post but not even then they dare to ask. For these the best always answer is **read the fucking right panel before asking ----&gt;**  
4. Normal intelligent people, that first they read, investigate, watch videos, educate themselves more or less that when something is wrong or they don't understand or they don't have enough information to process or have a conclusion, they come here and ask nicely and in intelligent way. For those I have great respect and I always try to give them the best answer I have or send them to the right place to ask more or investigate for themselves.

Bitcoin "legality" issue is a total nonsense. Bitcoin as money and as payment protocol is a nightmare for all legislators. They will fail and fail and fail again trying to put Bitcoin in a legal frame.  
Yes what they can do is to put pressure on the friction points (where BTC meet fiat).

That merchant will accept when will see that your money are BTC. So start talking with your local stores and convince them to take your BTC.  
I did that a couple of years ago and now I live on BTC from 2015 and I closed all my bank accounts. It is possible if you really want to get rid of banksters...  
By using a plastic card, you are not even giving the option to the grocery to look at your BTC.

Totally agree. But to have a useful payment system we need that to work as was designed. Instead what we have today:  
- high fees, even more than the payment  
- miners that are mining empty blocks and get the reward for that  
- wallets that doesn't work well or not give a real explanation to new users (I had these days many people calling me about their dust balance and couldn't send txs. They have no idea what is that)  
- merchants not educated about how to accept BTC  
- merchants that doesn't know anything about BTC  
- people that still want to use plastic cards with their BTC, the so called [bitcoin debit cards](  
- miners that do not want segwit but push for high fees  
When all these will be fixed in some way, yes we can have the best damn payment system and perfect money. And if we are not hurry up, the banksters will come up with their fedcoin, will fool all the rest of the world again, to use their fake money.

As I say it many times here: the adoption depends of each one of us. Do not wait until your stupid gov or some kind of big companies will say "from now on we accept BTC". That will never happen. The adoption start with each one of us, talk to each other in your local community, about what problems people have and try to fix them with BTC. Make discussion groups with your friends and neighbors, talk, find solutions, convince local merchants to accept BTC, not just going to their shop and ask about BTC payment, but talk with the owners and see their problems and give them solutions. Each one have a "door" where they can fit BTC.

Economics. Let's start by a small explanation. And please somebody save this for later...  
If you HODL some "stuff", those in time became more valuable. Because you create scarcity on the market. But many people do not understand very well this HODL.  
The means of BTC HODL is not to hold it until his value in worthless fiat grow, [but to HODL it when his purchasing power grow]( It is not the same. Selling your BTC for worthless fiat is the biggest mistake you will do in your entire life! In few years you will kick yourself in your balls because of that decision of today of selling your BTC.  
Let's be clear, it is NOT about the value in fiat in a near future, it is about the purchasing value of that BTC.  
It is a NONSENSE to sell your BTC for a big pile of worthless goat shit fiat when you can just buy stuff with those BTC and in time more and more stuff for the same amount of BTC.  
Now, let's see what does it means USE of BTC.  
Using every day BTC to buy stuff, you create more demand for this currency. More merchants will want to use it, then more people want to have it. More employers want to have it to pay his employees.  
So in this way you just start rolling over a small stone that became a big fucking giant stone.  
By using BTC as regular money, you create demand for these money, because many people will see that BTC is great as MONEY!  
This usage also will bring more "stability" and slow down the volatility, because if people use it more like money, there is no too much space for speculation on the markets.  
Yes the exchanges will continue to exist, are necessary, because we will start exchanging more and more altcoins/cryptos, because each person will find useful a specific crypto for specific usage. But Bitcoin will be the Master Coin.  
Then fiat, slowly will cease to exist.  
But what is important in all this? Bitcoin needs to be kept in the actual form of decentralization. We should not put the guard down in front of the banksters, they will try hard to bring their fedcoin (total control). And many people will fall (again) into this trap.  
**But that's why I strongly recommend: USE your Bitcoin as MONEY, every day. If you still don't have a place where to spend it, make that place, convince your local merchants, convince your local community, [convince your local administration to accept Bitcoin](  
**The Bitcoin Revolution and real freedom for humanity starts by using Bitcoin at local level, not at high level and "trading"!**

Is a point of failure. Is exactly the same like a bank safe box. But what happen when the bank will not give you anymore the access to your vault? That vault is useless. And really stupid to give your BTC to a Bitcoin bank.  
Many will say now, ok but you can use 2 of those keys from the vault into another multisig wallet. So then the question is: why in the first place you create that vault? You could create it anyway in your own multisig wallet and hide the keys. Done.  
Now Coinbase will know your address and will give up that info to the gov. 100% sure. They did it so many times, will not make an exception for you now.  
Bitcoin = Be your won bank = act accordingly = be smart, not idiot

Bitwage is just fine, don't be so greedy. For that good service you have to take in consideration many factors.  
But you could ask your employer to pay you in BTC, directly to your wallet.  
Market price (aka speculation) is not the same as P2P exchange (aka Bisq/LBTC), so Bitwage have to take a margin to cover their expenses/expected loses in the price fluctuation.  
I used Bitwage from 2015, but now many of income is directly in BTC so I use Bitwage just when a client really doesn't have BTC. I do not accept anymore fiat for long time ago, so Bitwage is great for this, no matter what rate they apply, the most important thing is that you get BTC not worthless goat shit fiat.

Always use a wallet that is giving you control of the keys. Coinbase is a bank, not a wallet.  
Use good wallets like Mycelium, Electrum, Multibit, Jaxx, Copay, Airbitz, Schildbach, that offers you full control of your money and keys.  
[Coinbase was created/funded by the banksters]( not to help you get into Bitcoin but to track you and later to control you. They present/promote themselves like a "bitcoin advocate" but in fact are just banksters. Watch out!  
Get out of there ASAP or you will end up like others:

First time I started in 2012, when a friend was mining BTC and he told me about. I bought from him my first 50BTC @ $15 or something like that.  
I never stop buying from that day until end of 2014. At any price, any time I had 20-50-100 cash available for that.  
From 2015 I didn't have to buy anymore, I start earning them, working for bitcoins.  
Now I have a really nice stash of BTC, cheap.  
The trick is to buy at any price no matter is and never think about that. Just HODL them or if you use them to buy something, buy back +10% more. Always think about that will be more expensive in few more months/years to buy than today. Never look at the falls, up/downs etc, that is just a distraction on short term. Always look at the charts for years not hours...   
Another way is to use these services to receive your wage converted from fiat to BTC. So no more hassle to buy anymore.  
 - you can even setup your % how you like to be in fiat and/or BTC    
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills - EU, maybe CA, US, MEX

By saying this you take out the whole point of Bitcoin (extract from Satoshi papers): A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

I live ONLY with BTC from 2015 and I closed all my bank accounts. It is possible if you really want it.  
Those so called ["bitcoin debit cards"]( are just a trap`from the banksters to keep people in line using their fake money fiat, until they will come up with their fedcoin, then boom, mass campaign for the sheeple or force them to use their shitcoin. Those cards are well designed to fool you to NOT use your BTC to buy stuff. Think again.  
And these scums companies are just squeezing more the user and make banksters game.  
Today there are tons of places where to spend your BTC directly.  
Start in your local community to talk with the people, make groups and explain about Bitcoin and how can fix their problems, start by being paid in BTC,   
I pay my rent, I pay my groceries, I pay car gas, I pay in local bars my beer, I pay my bills with BTC and all these are possible only because I start talking with people around me that I know them. I live in a small community in EU. We have to start locally and go globally. Bitcoin will never go from global to local. It can't, banksters will never let it and they will do everything they can to slow it down, including by those fucking cards!  
Only like that we can make Bitcoin to release use from the deep shit we are now because of the fucking banskters...

Please stop poring with these stupid useless brainwashing questions.  
This flood of questioning about taxes on BTC are a well organized manipulation technique to "prepare" the weak minds. The answer is: we don't care!  
[Please contact your local tax office. We are not doing their job, we pay them enough to do their job, to steal from us](  
This is r/bitcoin not r/taxes ... move your shit elsewhere.  
As Henry David Thoreau said more than 150 years ago, “If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.” [(source)](

Wake the fuck up and use only your BTC wallet, convince as many local merchants to accept BTC. Convince your local community and start from low level the Bitcoin Revolution.  
The giant clay monster (banksters) can be defeated only if we put fire and water under his feet, so will fall down useless and then we can crush his head with a stone. Throwing sticks to him will not be useful.

**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

The problem is not with people selling BTC for fiat, on those heavily manipulated exchanges.  
The problem is with the merchants:  
- those who still don't want to accept BTC or don't have enough good info about BTC  
- those who sell/dump their BTC immediately after they receive it from customers  
Merchants have to be educated/well informed to keep BTC and using them as money, paying their employees and suppliers with BTC. In this way we just close the circle and we don't need anymore to use fiat / be the heard manipulated by the wall street boys and banksters.

So now HSBC start laundering their dirty money with BTC...
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:28:59
Ok let me explain a bit more, as I received also more details.  
The user had 0.00231BTC in main wallet BC.i then imported another wallet with 1.xxx BTC. Then he wanted to send 0.00238BTC to a friend, like initiation in BTC.  
No message, no warning that the amount is way more than what he had in the main wallet. That's why he imported the other wallet, thinking that he can merge the BTC and send in total 2€ (0.00238BTC).  
In the tx screen there wasn't any option to select from which address to send or change the fee or do something. Just that error.  
OK for us, old bitcoiners maybe everything is simple and have an explanation, but for newbie, sending to another newbie, is a total nightmare. Even for me it was quite hard to explain to him what happen, because obviously you enter into technical details that not all will understand.  
My cry is to devs, to fix this in some way or give some more logical, human explanations to the regular user, to be able to send a damn 2€ to a friend.  
Do you know what just happen? The guy in the end says that he will send those 2€ by SEPA because it's free and can do it instant.  
We just lost 2 new bitcoiners! Why ? Because they can't use their BTC like was promised, as money, cheap, fast, easy.
@_date: 2017-01-03 23:00:49
Bitcoin = Be your own bank = act accordingly = you can have as many as you like "accounts". But in Bitcoinlandia you don't have accounts, you have BTC addresses. Millions if you like. And NOBODY will know how many addresses you have. [And stop bitching for taxes/capital gains and shit.]( here. We are not tax advisor or gov customer service.
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:36:49
Most of my travels (few) are in EU. You have to start with people around you, in your local community. Create groups to discuss and find bitcoin solution for people's problems. People will not get into BTC just because you tell to do so or just to be a fancy new money. No people wants solutions for their problems. Start working on that.

Always shapeshift those donations.  
I live on BTC from 2015 so I had many incomes to only one address. But always I shapeshift those.  
Shapeshifting = BTC -&gt; altcoins -&gt;BTC (to new created addresses split it into 3-4 chunks).  
You can use for shapeshifting:

Do you really think here is r/IRS? Why do you think we will do their stupid job?  
[Here is the best answer for you](  
Taxes never was designed to help the poor and welfare, but to fund wars and corruption. I disobey to fund those with my money.  
Just few examples here:  
- lost [9 trillions from FED]( (also our taxes)  
- lost another 6.5 trillions in [military funding](  
- lost track of [Irak war billions](  
- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [all taxes goes to military complex]( - how many roads, hospitals, schools etc can be built with these trillions?    
- pay taxes to [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](  
- pay taxes so [Pentagon can just spend $128 billions on submarines](  
[- pay taxes so the gov can tax me rain water and ponds on my property?](  
- pay taxes to build railroads [that later GM dismantle them to push their agenda of heavy use of cars](  
This list is even larger than you can imagine.  
And people still pay taxes like nothing happen, thinking that is for "common good"...  
Enough is enough, **fuck this shit**, with my btc will never fund a war or corrupt politician.  
[What is taxation?](  
[We forget something important](

No prob. Read, learn, ask, use :)  
The only I don't like at BCI wallet is that with this new version you can export anymore your private keys.  
That's why I use it but with self generated addresses which I keep the private keys. The default generated address of BCI I never use it.  
Anyway you have to keep in mind:  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank = act accordingly  
- mobile wallets, keep just change, no more than 10-15% of total BTC you own. Just for a beer or small shopping, exactly like a leather wallet with fiat.  
- desktop wallets, keep like 30-40% of total you have, for larger buys, bills, wages, etc, like a usual bank account, with many BTC addresses, managing them how you like.  
- hardware/paper/steganography wallet, keep the rest of your stash, the biggest part, the amount that you want to hold it for long time and do not touch it. You can put more and more into those wallets, without need to open them, you can check the balances anytime in any blockexplorer.  
The % you can decide whatever you like, that is just an example. Also spread the amounts in different wallets and BTC addresses, never keep all in one.
@_date: 2017-01-15 17:10:14

Another way that banksters fight for their lives/survival and keep people chained on them.  
Wake up people, withj Bitcoin we don't need any intermediary to receive your salary, wherever you are.  
Any bank that want a piece of your money in fact is violating the golden rule of Bitcoin:   
DO NOT LET THEM FOOL YOU AGAIN! Is the same move like was with gold: give me your gold bars to keep them "safe" in my vaults and I will give you a piece of paper shit that you can exchange it with your fellow stupid for goods and services, meanwhile I can sell again and again your gold for more and more shit papers...  
**[Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people]( Don't let this power to fall back in the hands of banksters, let's take Satoshi's vision far more away from these bastards banksters!**  
So this is not a "good news" for Bitcoin but a huge warning: people, do not give up your btc keys to any "bitcoin bank", it's a trap!  
You have been warned...  
Do not trust anymore than your own wallet.

I don't need your "approval" or "belief" for my living. I live like I want and I can. As far as I pay only with BTC from my wallet, I don't care if the merchant is selling/converting those btc in fiat. Is not my business. I am happy that I don't use anymore any bank account and fiat.  
The fact that you don't want to get rid totally of fiat and banks shows how deep is this mentality of fiat in people minds.  
I hope someday you will realize that I am right.

no, is because people are still stupid and ignore the consequences that will come later if they don't care about their privacy.  
If you check USD and EUR markets you will see who is caring about their privacy more:  
  
  
Today everybody wants quick money and they don't care how they obtain those BTC. I suggest them to be more careful. Will take time until people will discover the "utility" of bitsquare or when other "regulated" exchanges will close their accounts.

Sorry, I would love to buy a trezor with BTC, but we have greedy miners that are not allowing me to use my BTC to buy stuff for living, to receive my salary, to buy Black Friday offers etc.  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.

**Cyprus, Greece, India, Venezuela, Argentina etc happen for a reason**. The same reason why will happen also in your town and everywhere else. Keep repeating to yourself that will not happen but you will lie yourself. And when will happen, you will not be able to use none of them (fiat and btc) because for the fiat you and others will be with the pants down and for btc because nobody want to just start using it, so you will not have time to react.  
Start by convincing those few merchants you have around and be prepared.

In 5 years fiat will be only in museums... The so called "volatility" will be just few satoshis up/down because people will trade altcoins more.  
Today's volatility is because the baksters are trying a dump (thinking that only like that will kill BTC, but they fail over and over) and speculators to pump to make quick money. Both are the losers in the end, because Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck about both. Bitcoin will be the people's money in 5 years and will bring a lot of innovation and freedom with it.

**Don't promote higher fees! Don't feed the greedy miners!**  
We have greedy miners not "spam attack" that are not allowing me to use my BTC to pay my bills, to buy stuff for living, to receive my salary, to pay black friday offers.  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.  
The miners are doing the same operation for min fee or high fee, so why should I feed their greed?!

I live on BTC, so I don't need to buy anymore, I earn them. So in my case is 100% BTC.  
But I will tell you my previous "strategy".  
Back in 2012 I start mining but still buying also. I bought every month, no matter the price was. If I had 50-100-200€ available, I bought. And HODL. Those times wasn't so many places where to shop.  
Starting with 2013-2014 mining was dying so I start buying more, but less available fiat for that. So I start spending less on stupid things and keep the money until end of week and buy again at no matter the price was.  
**NEVER SOLD ANY SATOSHI**  
But starting with 2014 I found out that I can spend my BTC in many places so I start using them to buy things. But then buy back +10% more of what I spent.  
In 2015 I said fuck this shit of buying, let's try to earn the BTC and live only with BTC.  
March 2015 I closed all my bank accounts, throw away in the fire all the plastic cards and organize my BTC wallets.  
First I used bitwage.com and cashila.com to receive my regular wages from fiat to BTC.  
Then I convinced my employers to pay me using BTC. That was the best move ever!  
Now I don't need anymore to buy or exchange fiat to BTC, BTC is just coming to my wallets. And I spend only in BTC, not even those so called "bitcoin debit cards" (that are shit fiat cards). There is NO bank account in my name anymore! FUCK THE BANKS!

Don't be so naive... Any bank that is involved with Bitcoin is not there to help you to get BTC. Is there to track users and in a certain moment will push the button.  
Just look to Coinbase (another banksters tool).  
Stay away from any friction point with banks and govs, you will regret it later if you ignore this warning.  
Try to earn BTC or obtain them through p2p sources, not easy traceable. Don't make their job easy...

Yes they are German but let's leave that apart, not all germans are correct, like not all chinese are correct.  
I am always watching all bitcoin services that I use and I am very critical with all those who doesn't respect their terms.  
But being the first time this is happening I would say to take it easy and analyze what really happen.  
Sometimes these services are run by few people and answering to emails, in special during the Christmas time is not instant. I suggest to try contacting them by phone too and find out what happen.  
I am very curious about the answer and I think all here want to hear the follow up. So please share with us.

What happen in India will never affect too much Bitcoin adoption. We all want that but will never happen. But please stop using this news in speculators interest, because is just a hype used to raise the price of BTC.  
Why? Nobody ask about few simple things:  
- how many of those poor people in lines have a phone that can use a BTC wallet  
- how many of those poor people have an internet connection, able to use BTC  
- how many of those poor people CAN READ, to be able to use BTC  
- how many of those poor people can understand BTC, because BTC need a certain level of knowledge and education  
- and many more "issues" with indian people.  
Many will start saying that the Bitcoin adoption is driven by raising price. Maybe but only speculators thing like that.  
A person in need doesn't care about price, care about if Bitcoin can fix his problem. Then later will make his calculations to see if also can obtain a bit more money from the price move.  
Bitcoin need adoption but NOT driven by the price.  
Promote Bitcoin to those in need of something like Bitcoin, to break the chains of slavery from banksters fiat, from oppressive govs (in special US, the most oppressive gov with his slaves), to break the limits of innovations, to break the controlled markets, to facilitate free trade...

With patience and reasonable explanations about what is BTC and how it works. You have to give to each the reason to use BTC that they need it not just BS propaganda.  
Landlord - wants quick payments in cash, in person. I give him the reason of getting money quick, instant, P2P. Now he starts paying some of his employees for cleaning in his apartments with BTC...  
Grocery - Pakistani owner have his family in Pakistan, so he have to send all the time money to them, I show him how to share a BTC wallet with them and how to get BTC payments in his shop. Now is the happiest guy!  
Tell to each person what they want to hear from Bitcoin and they will get it. Start knowing the people from your local community, talk with them and find together a better way to thrive using BTC.  
**Do NOT offer BTC to those that doesn't need it!** You will make enemies from them. Wait until you find their weakness in fiat and then strike.  
Bitcoin in this moment is making small steps and that is the way should be, but each of this step should be very strong and not lose against fiat. One by one people will discover the power of Bitcoin to be the real true P2P money!

Many people are lost in this hysteria of making quick profit today. But Bitcoin is far more than just this (like stocks, shares, derivatives BS). Bitcoin is the future of money. The idea to have decentralized P2P money and use them as MONEY with giving a fuck about gov money is the whole point.  
Concentrate in having as much as you can BTC and use them as money, day to day. Today it is possible to live on BTC, I do it from 2015 and I closed all my bank accounts.  
Never wanted to be super rich in worthless fiat, but now I am rich in Bitcoin. Buying and never selling from 2012, at any fucking price, gave me quite a good stash of BTC.  
With what will help you to be rich in worthless goat shit fiat someday when the BTC price will be 10k$? With nothing, Those $$ will be goat shit.  
People should understand that this price of BTC is the price to get into the train NOT the price to make profit in fiat. If you sell you are lost. Use your BTC as Money.

I am really sorry but I can't say the exact location where I live. Is a small town in EU, good local community, quiet place, not too much tourism. We like not to be "disturbed" and in special by media (see what happen with the poor guy Dorian Nakamoto). We are OK like we are, happy.  
rent - directly to landlord (I convinced him to take BTC)  
groceries - local general store run by a pakistani (I convinced him to take BTC)  
beers, coffee, snacks - local bar, now there are 2 accepting BTC (my landlord convinced one owner)  
gas - the gas station started in 2016 to accept BTC too (I convinced the owner, now he's thinking to add like coupons to sell BTC or a BTC ATM in his shop)  
bills - I already posted so many times this list:  
  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills - EU, maybe CA, US, MEX  
 - EU  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills - CA  
 - pay bills, get wages - AUS  
 - pay bills AUS  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit - PH  
 - pay bills Thailand - TH  
 - AUS  
 - international   
Yes this list is not a perfect way to use your BTC, but at least you don't need anymore a bank account. You can close all of them. **I even paid taxes with cashila!**
other shopping - online, are plenty of places or services that you pay in BTC and they pay the shopping. Also if you buy with bank transfer you can use services like cashila to pay the costs with your BTC. Works directly from your Mycelium wallet, instant. To all those online merchants I recommend them to accept BTC and I always insist, any time I buy again. Some they start accepting, some still not, depends on their structure. There are good owners/representative that already know about BTC, but due to their closed systems is hard to adapt. We have to give them help, more information, solutions. The want to do it but the whole idea is too new for them and they have zero help. Some of them told me that they even don't know how to accept BTC on their site, I spoke with their IT and even them have no clue.  
This is where BTC companies and devs have to help merchants, make more tools, easy to use, promotions etc. Education is the key. Me personally I do what I can, but I am not a developer, I am an IT but not enough to change their systems. **We need to have more companies that dedicate to this: make solutions for merchants** T%his is a huge market that should be take seriously.  
Instead we have BTC companies that are pushing the so called ["bitcoin debit cards"]( that in fact are just keeping the merchants in the same position and will never be willing to take BTC. This is the biggest mistake we are making! Instead of going forward with merchant solutions we are going back to fiat with these "cards".  
As I said many times here: if you want to start living on BTC, start talking with your local community, convince them. Start from low level and go slowly to spread the word. Don't worry soon the suppliers for merchants will accept BTC too so the wheel start rolling over.  
Demand, convince your employer to pay you in BTC. This will force companies, first to start buying and storing BTC (instead of keeoing money in a bank) and then slowly to accept BTC for their products/services. This is a big step and advantage.  
**Do not wait until your gov/employer will say: ok from now on I will pay you in BTC". That will never happen!** You as individual are the only one that can change the shit we are living now. Banks, govs, big companies will never want to change to BTC because is against their goals (to control you as individual). Is time for us, as individuals, to start controlling our govs and our future. Is time for real democracy not the lies we are living today!

Great! I have a friend that few days ago he told me that he want to start "trading". He have no idea about "trading" and Bitcoin. I just initiate him in Nov '16 by buying some BTC and I told him, just to hold or use to them to buy stuff if he want. Ok all nice until he wanted to jump into "trading" BTC like a "pro".  
I told him that is a wrong game, that even playing dice or roulette with BTC is more profitable or at least the loses are not so bad and the win/lose is not manipulated.  
He ignore my advice and now, today is exactly like that image, believe me, he's calling me like crazy and crying what to do. STUPID NEWBIE ignoring the warnings and not HODL.

I am doing my part of strong defender of Bitcoin: I use it every fucking day and never used the damn worthless goat shit fiat! Never.  
I live on BTC from 2015 and I am pushing to BTC all people around me (that's why I can live on BTC).  
Bitcoin will never die if it is used like everyday money not a store of value. If people keep it like store of value (until we crush the banksters), will give the way to bankster to manipulate it on the market, like they do with gold and all other commodities.  
But if we will use it every day and we dump the fiat, there is END GAME FOR BANKSTERS.

I don't know WTF is RBF, CPFP, XRTP, or whatever fucking name. I need Bitcoin to be P2P money work normally so I can pay for stuff, bills, beers or whatever I want with no restriction from miners.  
When I get to use BTC I read first this:  
[Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
So I want Bitcoin to be what I read there not RBF, CPFP, XRTP, BRTS,  or whatever shit invented to make harder to use BTC.

@_date: 2016-11-17 17:30:41
I would never give advice for "where to sell" BTC, but "where I can use BTC to buy stuff":  
 - anything you want  
 - Open Bazaar search engine  
 - buy from any online shop with BTC  
 - buy with BTC and get discounts from Amazon  
 - general marketplace  
 - electronics shop for BTC  
 - groceries  
 - order food for BTC  
 - clothes for BTC  
 - tshirts with BTC   
 - pet food with BTC  
 - wines for BTC  
 - vary stuff for BTC  
 - coffee for BTC  
 - clothes with BTC  
 - cigarretes with BTC  
 - tech with BTC  
 - VoIP calls with BTC  
 - call in browser with BTC  
 - buy VoIP credit with BTC  
 - recharge your phone credit  
 - travel with BTC  
 - fly with BTC  
  
 - fly with BTC, see more countries on the bottom of their page  
  
  
 - listen music with BTC directly from creators  
Directory apps:

I don't hate Coinbase like company, I hate the banksters that are [behind Coinbase](  
And I don't shill for anybody and I expressed my position here:   
Coinbase doesn't have "competitors" because is a banksters tool. If you refer to bitsquare that always recommend, FYI that one is a **P2P decentralized** exchange not a banksters backed exchange and there is no company behind, is decentralized like Bitcoin and that's why I always recommend it. When will be launched another P2P decentralized exchange I will recommend it also, more better. For the moment is the only one and I hope that will be more.  
So your theory is FALSE.

not yet... any coinbase user sooner or later will end up in being seized, closed account, tracked, traded with gov etc...  
Coinbase was created by the banksters for the banksters to follow their game: slow down the BTC adoption until they will come up with their fedcoin.  
People are so blind, not looking to all those other places where to buy their BTC, they just stick with the evil, but still they know to complain...  
And this is the community fault because everybody here was "promoting and recommending" Coinbase like hell, without critical thinking.  
When somebody like me dare to say something against Coinbase is a crazy fuck and hater, not a person that just want to wake up the other to see the truth.

The biggest "danger" now is that the banksters will start a huge war against Bitcoin, by manipulations not by regulations. Media still have huge impact on people that do not read or try to find more information about Bitcoin and they are taken by the media manipulation. All media is in hands of banksters. This is a powerful and dangerous weapon for weak minds.  
My expectations are that banksters will try to slow down the Bitcoin use/adoption in a normal way (like I do) and they push losers into this "trading" game, many will lose their money, but some (backed by banksters with fake money) they will win. So in that moment many losers will say that Bitcoin is a scam etc and will push these words far more into population.  
This is a good plan for banksters, meanwhile they will prepare their own fedcoin, with more control, more restrictions, total slavery.  
[Please watch this Andreas talk, in one moment he explain this]( very well.  
If we let banksters to slow down BTC adoption we lose and we are losing everything: money, freedom, future and maybe lives. WW is a "price correction" in a fiat world. In Bitcoinlandia there is no possible to have wars, because nobody will want to fund them with their money or those who want will be very few and no endless funding.  
Bitcoin is a huge opportunity for the humanity to make a big step in evolution. If we go back to fiat or let them fool us (again) with fedcoin, we are going to a very dark age of total control and slavery, human depopulation replaced by robots. **When they will control your money they will control your life**. That's why they hate Bitcoin, because **Bitcoin is controlling them** and let the people free.  
Like Andreas said: **Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banks and give it to the people.** It is our duty now, the people, to continue his work and crush the banksters. How?! By just suing BTC and NOT fiat. No wars, no protest, no street occupation, peaceful protest by just closing your bank account. They can't do anything against this. But we need to be united.
@_date: 2016-12-20 10:00:27
Remember the golden rule of Bitcoin: you don't control the bitcoin keys, is not your bitcoins, you control the keys, it is your bitcoins.  
The simple, clean, fast, best way to have a website with bitcoin payment is Wordpress + Woocommerce + Bitcoinway.com plugin + YOUR Electrum wallet.  
Or just make an OpenBazaar shop and on your regular website put the link to OB shop for Bitcoin payments.

[These are the so called "bitcoin debit cards"](
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:54:22
WTF is this promoting VISA fucking fiat card on r/Bitcoin.  
Go to r/visa or r/fiat and promote the fucking cards!  
What is wrong with these people?! Instead of promoting Bitcoin your promote VISA and fiat?  
You say "*Benefits of our card.*" but nothing like **Benefits of paying with Bitcoin?**  
Wake up people! **Use your damn own BTC wallet, not any fiat shit card!**  
Do not let them fool you, all these cards are banskters tricks to keep in line of using their worthless fiat. Only by using their fiat (in any form) they can keep you slave. Break the chains and USE ONLY BTC!  
Today we don't need anymore these plastic cards full of shit. We have many places and marketplaces where you can shop directly with your BTC, secure, no snooping, no watching, with respect to your financial privacy. These cards are a direct violation to your financial privacy right!  
I am telling you now the benefits of using BTC and teh **risks** of fiat cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity or money - check  
- nobody will know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (can't spend more than you have) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):**  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity and money - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check

What is wrong with giving some help to other people about bitcoin services that normally other bitcoiners are using?  
What is wrong with adding these links to the "right panel" of this sub? Is that because the links in the right panel are outdated or misguided sometimes? I am sure you can find somebody that want to update those links. Why you consider my list of links to be "too much clutter"? Because I am NOT promoting only those companies that some other like it? I give them options to choose.  
All those links are real, legit, verified, used by many other users. If one of these will have any single problem against any user, I will remove it, because is not fair to be there. But all those links are crucial for any new user to know them. If that list will be contained in the right panel I will be glad NOT to post it over and over, that means that this sub is doing his works like should do: **inform**. But like you see every day there is a new comer asking for help that he couldn't find yet or is lost.

But she doesn't like this anymore, she said is not fun and waiting too long for the reward is not practical for her.

Where is the word "free" in my phrase?  
We have greedy miners that are not allowing me to use my BTC to pay my bills, to buy stuff for living, to receive my salary.  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.

Yes.  
But still, I will be against any fiat card. Are evil just because are using fiat and that is more than enough to be against them.  
And I hate more when I see that those cards are coming from companies that are supposed to bring Bitcoin to the people and not fiat cards.  
Let's be clear: those cards are fiat cards in pure sense of using fiat. Have nothing to do with Bitcoin. Selling those cards like "saviors of BTC" is a BIG FUCKING LIE!
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:28:35
Let's be clear: there is no such thing of "tax evaders" that uses BTC. There are free people and slave people.  
As I said trillion time here: [Coinbase was created by the banksters]( to **control** the people that uses BTC. Until now they were like the "best place where to buy BTC" just to attract fools. I warned so many times do not use Coinbase because will be later consequences and now they come.  
What you see now with this poema and crap, is just a masquerade to fool people more, giving the illusion of "democracy and rule of law", but is just the beginning of a big attack against Bitcoin.  
The "tax evasion" reason is just the beginning. Prepare for worst. You better dump all the fiat use exclusively only BTC. They can't stop Bitcoin but they can fool your mind.  
Remember my words.

Yes I use all of them. Each one has an use and I don't like to depend only on 1 wallet. I have for example Mycelium wallet imported in Electrum, some vanity address on BCI, that also I have them into an Electrum wallet on desktop. Multibit, Electrum, Jaxx also on Desktop with several addresses.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank = act accordingly. If you stopp only with one wallet app, you are stuck.  
On mobile wallets I don't keep too many BTC, max 1BTC/wallet. Like 50% of all my BTC stash I have in desktop wallets, 10% on mobile and 40% on hardware/paper/image encrypted.

Sadly seems that Bitcoin was hijacked from being money into a commodity, a "store of value" like some will say. With these increasing fees every few months and mempools stuffed with "unconfirmed" txs, Bitcoin will be used less and less like money until those who believe that the "store of value" is what is keeping alive Bitcoin, will find out that actually will not have value anymore because people are not using it like money.  
This is very sad, but is true and we have to fix this until is not too late. Banksters are just laughing at us and waiting to hit hard...

Nope. That should be 0 unconfirmed txs or at least only those with 0 (zero) fees.  
**THIS IS NIGHTMARE!**  
And this will happen again and again, because always we will have greedy miners that are not stopped by devs.  
Is not about big or small blocks, is just about greed.  
I start thinking that this is by design, that some will make huge money quick, now, and then they will just dump it and fucked up the whole Bitcoin.  
Many will say that we can go for another altcoins, but that is WRONG! All altcoins are linked to BTC, if BTC goes to bottom all goes to bottom. Who wins?! The fucking banksters! They will come up with their shit fedcoin and we are DOOMED!
@_date: 2016-12-03 12:04:50

All those cards are SHIT FIAT cards. point and clear. I will never go back to fiat.  
Those cards are another banksters trick to fool people to stay in line with fiat usage. Don't let them fool you with terms like "temporary solution", "bridges" etc are just manipulation techniques to not let people and merchants adopt Bitcoin in mass.  
All those companies that offer these cards to their bitcoin users are NOT making any good to Bitcoin, but in fact are pushing people back to use fiat.  
Companies and merchants have to go forward and find solutions (that already exist but are not promoted) for Bitcoin payments, wallet to wallet not through a shity fiat card.  
**Use your damn BTC wallet to make payments!** Start talking with your neighbours, with your local community, near local merchants and convince them to use BTC as payment method. This is the way to go forward not by using those shit cards.  
From Jan 2015 until now I lived ONLY with my BTC wallet, so it is possible, but if you want it. Don't let them fool you with those shit cards!

I live in EU. Yes my landlord accept BTC for my rent and he spend those BTC to the same grocery where I buy also with BTC. It's all about how you talk and explain with your neighbors, friends, community. I think people forget how is to talk to each other, next to you. Today I see people talking only through messaging apps even if they are next to each others.  
We have to change this and go back to traditional ways to know each other and talk. Only that way we really know what each of us need and we can help each other.  
Try to go and talk with your local community about Bitcoin, make groups, dinner parties, or in a bar, be open to each other and discuss your problems and how Bitcoin can solve them.  
I did that long time ago and now we are a nice community that uses Bitcoin in their life. **It is possible if you really want it.**  
Do not expect that your gov or some kind of big companies will announce that from today Bitcoin will be accepted as money. That will never happen and that will NOT be the adoption. Adoption start with each one of us.

you can store as much as you like. depends how much you know to protect yourself.  
Bitcoin = Be you own bank = act accordingly  
Personally I live 100% on BTC from 2015 and I store my BTC in these %:  
- mobile wallets (not only one but many): 10%, just change to be spent on street  
- desktop wallets (not only one): 30%, just enough to cover my monthly expenses  
- hw wallets (2-3): 40%, just to hodl, safe, not used at a daily/weekly basis  
- paper/picture/stenography wallets: 10% - emergencies  
All these wallets are backed up and stored encrypted in many different usb/remote storages/copies, accessible all the time and with 100% control only by me.  
Just an example: I use  (in many different ways) to hide in specific phrases, the 12 words passphrase of one of my wallets. I post that phrase into a normal text on my webpage or any other website or text that can be retrieved anytime, in plain sight. I told to my wife that when I will be about to die I will tell her where is that phrase located. She will just have to use that text into  and ... bingo you have the 12 words passphrase to my wallet. In plain sight.  
Let's say a war is starting... I have to flee quickly to another place, just have to access that phrase and I have back my wallet anywhere in the world.

Like Bitcoin_Forever, or something like that, with "Bitcoin". I saw even some that tried to copy my nicks adding a 2 or something after the nick, but they failed pathetic in their attempt to create a ghost of me  :) I know this is a well known tactic of gov agents to deceive people, is full of them here. Seems that I made a lot of noise and they don't like it :) Fuck them! I don't care.  
From 2012 until now I used several nicks just to fool gov agents, because not always I use the same "tone". That is by design to not let them find me/identify me easily.  
When a nick starts making too much noise, I park it and start over, in another way, another approach. But always with a goal: Making Bitcoin to win! To fuck the banksters!

A friend recommend me to another friend and then many "grandmas" and normal people wanted to know more about BTC.  
So I start a normal consultancy group, now I am thinking to extend the services in a nice webpage where people can ask and pay later when they get BTC. [No fiat accepted here](  
I would love to help all grandmas in this world to get their first BTC in their wallet and convert their pension into BTC like my mom is doing for years and also [Andreas mom is doing](

Use  to hide those 12 words passphrase into a more secret passphrase... :)  
Play with this and you will see that is a helpful tool.  
I have a nice phrase that hide one of my wallets, posted on a website text that nobody think is a wallet in plain sight. I can recover that wallet wherever I am, without knowing the 12 words.

Let's not forget ["who" is behind Circle](  
[Circle is proactively monitor his users](  
One by one all of these so called "regulated" exchanges will show up their true face: banksters hand.  
**Everything is for a reason**...  
All these "exchanges" wasn't created by the banksters to have a huge database of those who buy and use BTC, for later "use", track etc. As you know Coinbase and Circle had from the beginning huge marketing support, to take as much is possible "clients", that in the end they realized that are trapped in this.  
People should understand one thing: banksters will do everything possible to put down Bitcoin and that include services like BTC exchanges that are accumulating user data. The next step is a cashless society, then all guns on BTC users (that they already have their data). Will start a huge campaign against all BTC users, so stay put!  
Get out from all "regulated" exchanges, use as much you can p2p exchanges, ATMs, in person trades or damn it work for bitcoins and forget of buying BTC! Start living of BTC and forget about their worthless shit fiat! We already have mined almost 16 million BTC, enough to start a new economy **FIATLESS**, only with BTC!
@_date: 2016-11-30 23:05:51
This will happen all over the world soon.  
I said all the time that the "regular" exchanges are the friction point where the govs will push the button when they will decide that Bitcoin did a lot of "destruction".  
One solution is to use P2P exchanges like bitsquare and I hope there will be more like this.  
The other solution and the best: work for bitcoins, talk with your actual employer to pay you in bitcoins. In this you push companies/merchants to accept BTC, because also for the employer will be harder and harder to buy BTC. so in the end many companies will start accepting BTC.  
People, we already have 17 millions of BTC in circulation, more than enough to start a new free economy!  
Stop using those exchanges like your personal wallet/bank and trade to speculate!  
Use your damn BTC wallet and demand to be paid in BTC and FUCK THE FIAT AND THE BANKSTERS! They can't stop the Bitcoin Revolution!
@_date: 2016-11-01 23:30:11
Any plastic card is linked to a bank account in YOUR name, no matter you do to load that card with FIAT. What you don't understand with that?

@_date: 2016-11-25 14:27:58
No I don't want to fix BTC network ONLY for me, I want Bitcoin to work for everybody else. It's a difference.
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:12:55
You still don't understand that your bitcoin never go anywhere, are just sitting quietly on the blockchain, forever.  
What is changing ownership are the keys to those bitcoins.  
To handle those keys is necessary to encrypt them with a passphrase. So actually that passphrase is the "key" to the keys of ownership... is not "restoring" any balance or bring back any bitcoin in your "wallet".  
Think like you have a secret code for a big safe, where are stored any kind of coins. Each person/entity have his own code to open that giant safe and be able to move the coins around (only inside of that safe) to other own boxes or others boxes. But the coins will never move from that giant safe.

Again another talk about how to incriminate Bitcoin in being the currency of the bad guys...

**Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank = Act accordingly**  
You control the private keys - it is your bitcoins. You don't control the private keys - is NOT your bitcoins.  
Bitcoin bank = you never will be in control of that wallet  
Vault = offline bitcoin bank = a kind of fooling you that your money are safe, but you can't access them, so are not your money anymore.  
Personal wallet = a wallet that gives you FULL CONTROL of the keys of your bitcoins.  
A wallet is actually a ring keys that keep the access to your bitcoins. Bitcoin ALWAYS will stay quietly on the blockchain, they are not into your "wallet". Your wallet is just giving you the access to your bitcoins. So actually the Bitcoin Blockchain is the big fucking "vault" that keeps everybody's bitcoins.  
I already told you  and you have all info about those wallets that gives you full control of your keys.

That's the beauty of Bitcoin: you don't need permission or intermediary to receive bitcoins (money) on a website.  
Your own BTC address/QR code posted on a website is enough to receive money.  
If you want something more elegant use the Electrum wallet instructions to receive BTC from your website:   
Also  have a nice and easy way to accept btc on a website based on WP+Woo, linked to your Electrum wallet.  
Bitcoin is permission-less, border-less, open source, not age restriction or any other restriction.

Are OK those 3. Jaxx also you can use same wallet on desktop, it's a nice pairing.  
Also Electrum have the same utility mobile/desktop and is a very good wallet.  
For mobile I can add:  
- Mycelium - plugins for Glidera, Cashila, local trader, ledger HW  
- Airbitz - merchants directory, glidera, vouchers buy in  
- Schildbach - one of the first mobile wallets, simple design, works great  
All of these gives you full control of your keys.  
Personally I use all of them.  
There is not any "best wallet". Each wallet have particular features that each user can find them useful for his use.

Bitcoin hash power will never get fall. As I said many here will be more than happy to start home mining with personal rigs and pools.  
Decentralization is the key to everything, including mining. What will happen if tomorrow the chinese gov will shut down all mining facilities? Yes will be days of chaos but quickly everybody that still have a mining rig at home will start and the hashing power will be restored. And I am 100% sure that these small miners will accept ANY fee...
@_date: 2016-11-13 11:54:48
I really see it in other way this way for incentive: giving away BTC is a form of saying "hey, take here something that I don't want it or is worthless for me/I obtain it free".  
Hotelgo24.com should start accepting BTC for booking a hotel and not giving away BTC.  
I see this just a BS campaign.  
We need merchants to accept BTC not giving away like garbage...

How much is a good beer? And still you don't dare to buy like 10 beers at once?!  
Why not buy 1 BTC at once and then spend it when you need?  
BTC is the digital gold, in time, will never devalue but gain value. Using it to buy stuff enrich every user.  
Looking to buy £4 is like looking to buy the cheapest beer, but with the quality of the strongest beer...

We have greedy miners that act like banksters... that's all.  
And this is a direct violation of [Satoshi papers]( where is stipulated at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"   
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: miners limiting the amount of fee.

Always give up privacy for convenience... You will see that these "building bridges" are in fact a BIG fucking tool to manipulate you and slow down the REAL Bitcoin adoption.  
Bitcoin adoption start with us, as individuals, not with big companies accepting BTC. BY NOT using fiat or use it less and less is a direct disobedience against fiat slavery. If you really want to be a free person you need to make this step.  
Banksters will do everything possible to keep people in line to use their shit fiat, including these SHIT cards. These cards are in fact A BIG DISTRACTION!

Nope. Ether is NOT a P2P electronic cash.  
I live on BTC from 2015 and I didn't choose to do dump all the fiat, just to ump over and over to each cryto ever exist, just because one is not working as it was designed.  
I was fascinated by BTC in 2012 when I read Satoshi's papers and I thought: that's it, this is the future of humanity, an electronic P2P cash system, nothing else.  
If will exist an crypto backed by a certain amount of BTC, maybe I will use in the same way like I use BTC for living, but until then the rest are just garbage or used for other purposes but NOT a P2P cash.

I have a wallet suggestion.  
Make a merchant directory in wallet where:  
- merchants can publish their shop, offers, instant-offers, discounts etc. They pay to the wallet provider for those ads.  
- users use that directory to find near place where to spend their coins or if the user agree, the merchants can push ads to the near placed users with offers. If the user accept the offer, will get a discount from the merchant and/or a small incentive to see that ad.  
- wallet provider gets a slice of the revenues and can offer better versions/services.  
Think about this like in future.

The keys are encrypted on local device, are not leaving you.  
This should be a reminder for all wallet users: once you create your wallet, export the keys and store them in a safe place (offline password manager). Do not put any funds in that wallet if you can't export your keys!  
Once you export the keys YOU are the responsible for security of those keys. It's your problem if you get hacked, scammed, keylogged etc. Do not complain here or other forums that you get hacked and you didn't kept safe your keys, is not Bitcoin fault or wallet provider fault, it's YOURS and only yours.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank = **act accordingly**

Bitsquare was just released this year and is an independent decentralized exchange not like Coinbase/Circle with huge army of paid shills that every day post here.  
Bitsquare is NOT a "trading" platform for speculators, is the safest platform to help people to get some BTC, not being tracked, questioned, seized by banksters and govs.

When you take a loan from a bank you go with an armored truck to the bank to take the cash or you just open an account?  
Is the same with Bitcoin and more than that, Bitcoin = Be your own bank = act accordingly.

No! I am really pissed off these days waiting for my normal txs to get through, but Bitcoin will not be fixed only with block increase. In few months we will be in the same shit again.  
This fee market is INSANE and is ruining Bitcoin making people to get sick about it and they will end in NOT using Bitcoin at his real value.  
If Bitcoin will be used only like store of value and with only few txs will end up in not being used anymore.  
People don't need another sore of value, we have the gold that is doing great job for that. People need decentralized P2P money, exactly how was "promoted" to be Bitcoin.  
[Satoshi papers]( right at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Today we see greedy miners that act exactly like financial institutions, selecting which tx can get through or not.  
I agree to pay a min fee to the miner for his efforts, but I will not agree to give them power to decide who can have a tx or not, based on their greed.  
I understand that now we have limited capacity of blocks, but this should not make some users better than others, just because they have more satoshis or not to pay the fees.  
The acceptance of txs should be equal in rights for everybody, no matter the fee they pay, but in the order of broadcast time. Everybody will agree and wait in peace until his tx will get through because they will know that the network is collapsed because of too many txs.  
Forcing me now to pay a higher fee just to be in front of other that doesn't the chance to have more satoshis is not right! And exactly for this Bitcoin will fail! I am sorry to say that, I am BTC_forever but seems that Bitcoin was hijacked by greed.

Really? Coinbase? And you still use Coinbase?   
Is time for you to reevaluate what you use. There are tons of wallets and exchanges out there, Coinbase should be your last last option...  Please don't make me to post again the endless list with those who lost their money, accounts, privacy, liberty because they use Coinbase, I already posted so many times that I am already tired.  
When I heard first time about Coinbase, back few years ago, I didn't download their wallet immediatelly but I start digging first to find more info about who is behind them and I found this:

Coinbase is the trojan horse introduced by banksters in Bitcoinlandia, what you don't understand that?

marketcap is just an illusion about usage of those cryptos. Doesn't make sense to compare cryptos to a fiat endless fake money. To evaluate the total coins on the market based on the latest price on exchanges doesn't make any sense for saying which is most used or better to use.  
Ah if you make a graph of all cryptos exchanged for/from gold, then yes maybe there is a start to evaluate them.  
Marketcap definitely IS NOT the parameter that will say which crypto you should use...

**1000% Jaxx.**  
I remember you the golden rule of Bitcoin:   
But also there are so many other good wallets out there, which gives you 100% control of the keys, like a Trezor.  
Even easier: a passphrase of 12 words, hidden in a nice phrase using passphrase.io, and that phrase hidden into a text on your own website, in plain sight, will be a much better way to store some BTC than Coinbase.  
**Coinbase, not even for my enemies I will recommend it.**  
Another way, this: 
@_date: 2016-12-31 18:03:33
Are you blind? Can't read?   
Coinbase IS NOT "fighting", is just faking the fight. All "drama" with theIRS was by design a fakery. Gov doesn't care about some dudes to pay taxes, they just created Coinbase to be their bitch in grabbing data from users, what they do, how they do, links with other wallets etc the whole mapping. If you step back a bit and try to see the whole big picture you will see where is going all this. The devs from Coinbase are poor guys that were fooled to work for the gov, they don't even know about this whole game.  
The Masters are behind of all this and pulling the strings...

Yes the IRS-Coinbase "drama" hide something else, but not a confiscation.  
Let's be clear: **Bitcoin can't be confiscated, seized without YOUR consent.**  
But the govs now are trying to find a way to tax bitcoiners, gov always is looking for taxes, because only in this way they can pay for their corrupt crooks backers and keep you in slavery.  
That's why is **strongly recommended** to stop using "regulated exchanges" and keep your BTC in your personal wallets. Fight for your financial privacy that is a right exactly like freedom of speech!

Many people do not understand the low volume on bitsquare, but is quite simple: NOBODY or few people (that really need to) want to sell their BTC for the worthless goat shit fiat.  
Let's be clear, a P2P exchange is what real people have to sell, one to another, is NOT a manipulated speculator exchange that can create orders without any verification/coverage, just to push or pull the price and fool the small fishes to put their money thinking that they are "traders"...  
A P2P exchange is exactly what a free market will do: demand and offer for the need of buying/selling, nothing more, no speculation no nothing.

**Bitsquare is to just buy/sell BTC P2P**, people should understand this. Bitsquare is a form of escape from fiat not a form of making money from trading. That's why is having a limitation amount, so scammers and "traders" will be pushed out. This is for REAL bitcoiners not for speculators!

Coinbase is part of this masquerade, [it was planted from the beginning by the banksters]( The goal wasn't to tax bitcoiners, but to OBTAIN information about bitcoiners, their info, their habits, their parties, links etc. So from this they can build other "services" to track down bitcoiners.  
I said this many times here, to stay away from Coinbase because it's a trap. But nobody wants to listen my warnings. Intead everybody jumped to use their services, saying that they have nothing to hide... bla bla bla. But in fact is not the case to hide something. Is to NOT give them that information in the first place.   
Coinbase fooled people with their "nice" services and huge campaigns, brainwashing machines etc so people fall into that trap.  
Now... not only those Coinbase users will pay the consequences, but everybody else too. This will have huge implications.

Today there are many ways to live on BTC and you can do it in your own way. Don't look at what many trolls say it here against you, they hate you because they can't or don't want to live only on BTC.

Just patience, we have greedy miners that are not allowing to use your BTC to pay my bills, to buy stuff for living, to receive my salary. Maybe later a good miner will decide to accept the low/normal fees txs and your tx will get through, that depends on how much greed they have.  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.

Jaxx is for all platforms and you always can export and store your private keys elsewhere.  
I think you can't make the difference between:  
- control 100% your fucking keys  
and  
- NOT having control 100% of your fucking keys.  
Coinbase will do this all the time:  
- will never let you to export the wallet keys  
- will stop you to access your wallet any time, without notice  
- will close your account/wallet without getting any money back  
- will seize your money if they consider that you use them in illegal activities or just because is not in their policy  
- will give to your gov all your account movements, balances etc  
- will act like a fucking bank

I have 5 txs waiting in mempool, to pay some bills with deadline, now I have to pay penalties because the fucking greedy miners didn't approved my txs. So who is going to pay those penalties?  
This is not a system that is working how should work. This is insane. And this is only miners fault. Is not about big or small blocks, is just a fucking nightmare that devs are fighting each others and together with miners. Miners see only quick profits and they don't care about the future of Bitcoin and our future.

Yeah I know, CNN is the real "fake news" :) and maybe sumBTC is one of them trying to discredit me. I don't care. I am just happy that for the moment I have freedom of speech to say what I think here and financial privacy using my BTC wallet. That is all that matter. When both of these are gone, we can say sayonara baby to humanity...  
That's why we have to defend Bitcoin with all the "guns, powers and determination", is our only hope.  
We are like Princess Leia, sending the hidden message to ObiWan Kenobi: "Help me Bitcoin, you are my only hope..." :)

But seems that the devs are not interested in making Bitcoin "great again"... and start downvoting this idea ;)

Yes it is. Very few people really understand what is the real goal of Bitcoin... I hope I am one of them :) we are still at the beginning of the beginning of something extraordinary that happen in the whole human history: real freedom.  
Why? Because when an individual can control his money, then he can control his freedom.

Meanwhile AntPool is mining empty blocks, take the reward and reject the txs with min fee, accepting only those with high fee or astronomic fee. See their history please.

 - P2P decentralized exchange, **strongly recommended**  
  
 - ATM list  
 - US &amp; Canada, integrated into Mycelium and Airbitz wallets  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards

 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 - buy in AUS with cash, ATM  
  
  
@_date: 2016-12-11 22:27:54
Everything that is linked to a bank account (those cards can't work without that) is tracked. Why do you think they started now the war on cash? To be able to track you everywhere. The excuse of saying that is to track money laundering and terrorists is just a lie to give you the false idea of giving you more security, but in fact is to keep you in slavery, modern slavery, [to obey, pay taxes, be in debt forever](  
 - anything you want

**This is a total BS**. All coins are bitcoins and have the same value.  
With fiat cash if I wipe my ass and then I put the bill again "in circulation" nobody cares that is transporting my DNA and yet is used as money.  
People don't fall into another trap manipulation!

Groceries - from the corner shop I have in my community, a pakistani guy that is happy to take my BTC and use them with his family in Pakistan (they share a wallet). I convinced him to take BTC long time ago when I hear him struggling to send some money to his family.  
Gas - local station, again I convince the owner to accept my BTC months ago.  
Rent - I convinced my landlord to accept my BTC when I start being paid in BTC. Now he pays some of his employees for cleaning with BTC and he pays also in a bar in our community his beers.  
Other shoppings - online. As I said before  
  
  
  
can find almost anything you like.  
To receive wages/payments/pay bills from/to those who still don't have BTC I use:  
 - wages/payments  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit  
 - recharge your phone credit  
  
  
  
 - buy/sell BTC, pay bills 
Is just about changing your mentality first. Then stay focus on NOT using any bank account/fiat in your name.  
Is not easy, but it is possible, you need just some determination - **FUCK THE BANKSTERS!**

nope, bitwage is the ramp for those who want to get paid in BTC but their employers still can't pay in BTC directly.  
Everybody is free to "shapeshift"· their income. I am doing it **all the time**, I do not leave any BTC income without being known/traced back to me. Good luck finding the real destination BTC address after the income was shifted 2-3 times into altcoins and back to new BTC addresses and obfuscated txs.

Another BS story with misleading title. **there is no way to *seize* bitcoins from somebody, other than FORCE him to giveup the private keys**.  
STOP scaring noobs with "bitcoins are seized by gov", this is a BIG FUCKING LIE, bitcoins are just fine on the blockchain and can never be "seized" like cash. Also the keys can't be seized without owner approval.  
If you are dumb enough to keep your private keys without encryption or give up the keys to the gov you deserve it but that will not be a "seizing" action, can be named whatever you want but not seizing.

I strongly recommend to use aliases for each "bitcoin site" so you will know which one was leaked. Using a single email address for all these kind of sites, you will end up being spammed like hell and maybe hacked.

Nobody will steal it from that wallet if you keep safe your backup and stay away from malware.  
I use that wallet from 2012 (mobile and desktop) and I never get robbed.  
But is true that you still don't have full control of your keys in that wallet. You should keep large amount of BTC in a wallet that gives you the option to export your keys and you can import those into another wallet in case you can't access this one.

Just don't use Bitpay in any way and is a much better option to support Bitcoin.  
Bitpay is the fucking enemy of Bitcoin, even if you circumvent or not, you just support them by making a payment to their wallets.  
Most important is that merchants get well educated in this matter. Merchants have to dump this shit immediately and use directly their BTC wallet, no more intermediaries. BTC Pay is the right choice.    
Everything starts with [Satoshi's papers]( **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

Use a P2P decentralized exchange like Bitsquare.io  
Coinbase, Circle and some more will track all your activity buy/sells and will give up that date to your gov.

That is the proof of what I am saying here for years: all exchanges are manipulating the volume and prices. Behind 90% of all exchanges are the banksters with huge amount of fake money. This is a game and they will crush the price to the level that is convenient for them.  
As I always said: stop the fucking trading and use EXCLUSIVELY Bitcoin. Dump the fucking worthless fiat. 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC but [you will always buy more and more things with 1 BTC](

Guys, I just found [the real DPR]( and is not Ross!  
As I always said, SR case was from the beginning a setup of FBI/NSA, they attract Ross inside, using him like a patsy, but they had full control all the time of the entire operation.  
The goal of this was to discredit the Bitcoin community and use this case like an example for those who use Bitcoin. More than half of "sellers" on SR were FBI agents, with the purpose of tracking all others.  
FBI can do this, they have the resources and they continue to do it later with many sites, like this for example:   
They will not let Ross free because they know that if the trial will be fair Ross will come up with proofs that he was a patsy. That's why they give him life in prison so he can never say the truth.  
I know I will get downvoted for this because I know that we are full of agents here, but I don't care, many others will see this and start thinking...

If you already have those BTC in a more or less anonymous way obtained I suggest to keep them in [your personal wallet]( and never exchanged to fiat.  
There are so many places where to spend them that you really don't need to convert them to fiat.  
Those "bitcoin debit cards" are fucking fiat cards! That means: [you are taxed, tracked, seized, robbed etc.](

Actually I have a small fortune (in BTC) accumulated... 
My first 1 BTC I earn it in few days playing a faucet in 2012. That was my first contact with Bitcoin. Then I start reading more about and start mining with CPU/GPU/USB until 2014. Meantime also buying more BTC at any price, except when was $800-1200. That was too high for me and couldn't buy too much.  
In 2014 I bought at any price, whenever I had some spare fiat money.   
I never sold any satoshi. If I use some btc to buy stuff I bought back +10%.  
So imagine that was accumulating some.

Paypal will never use Bitcoin just because they know that will have to violate the definition of Bitcoin: [Satoshi's papers]( - **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
If people do not understand this simple definition, then they will never understand WTF is Bitcoin and WHY was created in the first place: **to eliminate all these bloodsuckers intermediaries!**

That link explain very simple: you export the private keys from an old bitcoin-qt wallet file, thne you can import them into other wallet like Electrum, Mycelium, Jaxx etc.  
[Coinbase is not a wallet, is a fucking bank.](  
Don't sell your BTC, USE them to buy anything you like or just HODL them.  
There are tons of places where you can spend your BTC. Bitcoin ARE MONEY!  
If you really don't know where to spend them, I can give a full list of places.

If I would have deep pockets with BTC... NO. I will buy anything with BTC just to sustain the Bitcoin economy.  
Actually I'm doing that, I live on BTC from 2015... No more fiat accepted, closed all the bank accounts.  
The prices for that are prices, because are the balance between demand and offer. If wouldn't be people with enough BTC to pay for those overpriced products, the merchants will have to lower their prices. This is the way the free market work.

As I said many times here but no one seems to get my point: Silk Road was a masterpiece plan from the beginning to be a honeypot and a playground for FBI/NSA. They used Ross like a patsy letting him to believe he is in control of SR, but in fact they control it all the time.  
In the same time they used SR to be a weapon against people that want to use Bitcoin and they created a huge campaign against Bitcoin. They didn't have so much success, Bitcoin is still thriving.  
But this should be a lesson for all bitcoiners and stay put against all these kind of plots/traps/fake "darknets". Do not underestimate the power and the will of banksters to destroy Bitcoin. Now they saw that they can't destroy it and will try to control it by controlling the friction points. This is most dangerous than ever.  
But we can still fight: dump the fiat and use exclusively BTC, we have more than 17 millions in circulation, is quite enough to start a new economy without fiat.

But quite lame your proposal. You better start talking nice with people in your community, around you.  
I live on BTC for more than a year, but I never think to do that stupidity, like you said. I start convincing my clients to pay for my work in BTC. That means I "forced" them a bit to obtain BTC in order to pay me. In the beginning they pay me through bitwage and cashila, but now they pay me directly wallet to wallet. That means they start accepting BTC or they buy BTC for themselves.  
I convinced my landlord to accept my BTC for the rent. Now he's paying others for cleaning services in BTC...  
I convinced a local grocery to accept BTC, now he start sharing his wallet with his family from another country and other clients start paying with BTC...  
Make things working around you, make the BTC to be desired not to be forced. Asking people to buy BTC on the street looks like you value more fiat than BTC, when should be at reverse.

Don't try to protect the liars and the banksters with this BS article.  
Is well known that Circle, Coinbase, Getgemz etc are banksters "incubators".  
Circle - Goldman Sachs  
Coinbase - BBVA  
Getgemz - Citibank  
They (the banksters) designed, funded, run from behind all these "bitcoin services" just to get more information about bitcoin users, study them, control them, to prepare later their own "coin" app.  
I am sorry for all good those developers that work for those companies, many of them don't have any idea about what is going on.  
You will see later what will happen, that I am right. Banksters will try to counter-attack Bitcoin with their own coins/apps. And Bitcoin should be prepared, the war just started...

My first buy was at $30, from a friend. For me even if is going lower than $30, I don't care, for me Bitcoin is P2P decentralized money. That is all that matter.  
From 2012 until today I bought, I mined, I played faucets (when was decent drops), I work for BTC, never sold, so now I have enough to live in peace, enough for my retirement. From 2015 I live only with BTC and I closed all my bank accounts.

Nope. I stopped tipping long time ago and also I rejected all tips. Nowadays tipping/giving away bitcoins/satoshis is a crazy habit, you are throwing away real valuable money.  
If you really want to donate some satoshis or bitcoins you go for places to donate for a cause or because somebody put some effort in doing something. But tipping on reddit, today, is not a good thing.  
watchmybit.com, otika.tv, streamium.io and many others are doing great job with pay-per-view or view-per-tip ways to monetize content.  
Tipping is dead for long time. Like faucets. That was at the beginning to make people use cryptos. Now is time for serious things.

Nowadays people are giving up too easy their fundamental rights for convenience and "easiness", but later all of them are crying...  
Giving up your right of financial privacy for the easiness of "dumping" BTC on an exchange will make you to cry later.  
People look too much at BTC like a commodity to get rich quick, but they miss the whole point of BTC: Bitcoin wasn't created for these speculations, but to empower people with their own P2P money.  
**Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now people, instead of continuing his vision and plan, they start "trading" BTC like a goat and going back and forth into fiat money, staying in the same shit**...  
Instead of "dumping" 500BTC in an exchange why not you dump few millions of worthless goat shit fiat and start using BTC for a living, like it was designed to be.  
I live on BTC for more than a year, I closed all my bank accounts and I am just fine. Bitcoin revolution start by dumping fiat and not using it anymore.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:40:25
First of all you should start learning more about Bitcoin and start by doing small transactions like testing. You can test with some satoshis, knowing how to make transactions, fees, amounts, securing your wallet, backup etc. And then is time to use it with large amounts. Otherwise you can lose ALL your money for a stupidity or not paying attention.  
A transaction sent to wrong address is IREVERSIBLE. You will never get back those money.  
So start learning, watch lots of videos about wallets (there are tons on Y_T). Once you are ready, also pay attention to details.  
One more thing to always remember:   
Here you have a page explaining about each wallet 
@_date: 2016-11-30 11:34:48

If Bitpay really wants to have more BTC adopters, will make the merchants to want to use BTC payment not pushing back to the obsolete, fake, violating rights, stealing money that is a fiat card.  
**This is outrageous from a Bitcoin company to offer to his clients fiat products!** The banksters are just laughing at us now...

@_date: 2017-01-14 20:02:02
Yeah yeah, blah blah, [obey and pay your taxes slave bitch]( shit cheap propaganda... for his masters.  
I closed my last year with ZERO gains. [Come and get it if you can! You get shit!](  
This post is total brainwash manipulation oreder by The Masters, to put into people mind the ["duty to pay your taxes and respect the laws".](  
US people are just zombies that obey the masters laws, [they forget who were 300 years ago]( they don't even think about saying something against the unjust laws.  
Like Coinbase, instead of fighting for their customers rights, they just do masters game, hiding behind the "respecting the laws" "pay your taxes" and shit. They are threaten by the gov? Ok close the fucking business and be strong and defend your customers. Others with strong spine and balls they did that. Fuck this shit!  
With this, Coinbase just prove that is a piece of shit, masters tool, [they will not bite the hand that feed them.](  
The whole this "drama" is just dust in the wind, is not about taxation or tax evading controls. Is about **control of the losers** that uses Coinbase. This was the plan from the beginning when the banksters created Coinbase.  
Why IRS didn't go for all US based exchanges at once, in a single day? Because they don't care. They already have the info, not they just want a show, a media show, with Coinbase as lead actor.

@_date: 2016-11-15 21:04:14
Nope, you are not wrong. We already know that all the "regulated" exchanges have behind the banksters and/or gov agencies. And now that they see Bitcoin taking a lot of attention, they also start bugging users.  
Like Coinbase also [Circle was funded by banksters]( and as we know it, banksters will not make any "investment" if they will not control that "investment".  
Right now Bitcoin became a real alternative to their fake money so they will start pushing all the "friction points" like exchanges.  
That's why we need to stop using at a regular basis these friction points and start using P2P decentralized exchanges or simply stop buying BTC and earn them directly.  
The war just started. Banksters and govs will start banning all cash, then force or fool people to use their "fedcoins" and make a nightmare for those who use Bitcoin. Manipulation will huge this time. They will not ban Bitcoin, they don't want to attract more attention than is already, but will make Bitcoin to be the currency of the "bad guys" and incriminate all those who use it by these sneaky and cowardly techniques.

In US (they still don't wake up), but in EU it starts to be heavily used. Liquidity comes from users not from the exchange. If the liquidity comes from the exchange then is manipulated, fake volume to make you to put your money in it.  
Bitsquare IT IS NOT for speculation purposes, "trading" and shit. Bitsquare is a safe P2P place where people can EXCHANGE (sell/buy) their BTC/alts/fiat. There is no central authority that manage the volumes, liquidity, price. Only the users.

- lost another 6.5 trillions in [military funding](  
- lost track of [Irak war billions](  
- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [all taxes goes to military complex]( - how many roads, hospitals, schools etc can be built with these trillions?    
- pay taxes to [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](

With all your money in BTC you are just fully protected against any intent to be robbed, seized, blocked etc. You will need just 12 words, in your memory, USB, paper or whatever other way.

Is preferred NOT to have anything on those bitcoin banks. They are anyway crooks banksters and not trusted at all. I don't care about any legal recourse if I have my own wallets. At reverse, can be more legal recourse if you keep coins in those bankwallets, they track your moves, they will know anything about you and will use that info against you anytime.  
BTW, "verified" with Coinbase/Circle = you are 100% tracked and your financial privacy is violated.

The whole point of Bitcoin that most of the people are missing (and is stated very clear in Satoshi's papers) is that Bitcoin is"*A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.*" No more no less.  
It is the fundamental change of money in the whole human history.  
What you were trying to say in post is that Bitcoin is more a "speculative" item and IT IS NOT.  
Bitcoin will change the world as we know it, including the way we speculate with things. Mark my words, in few years you will see that happening.  
In 2015 when I decided to go full living on BTC and closed all my bank accounts, it was because I saw in Bitcoin the true change of human history: breaking the chains of slavery from the banksters. That is a fundamental change for our evolution.  
The price that BTC is traded on exchanges is just a distraction and sometimes a manipulation of the banksters. They know that they can't stop Bitcoin as a network protocol so they start diminishing the trust of people in Bitcoin as money. So they will start playing on the speculkative markets with the... price. They have unlimited amounts of fake money (fiat) at disposal so they will pump/dump the price whenever they want. You will see a huge drop in price in Jan-Feb 2017. They did once, they will do it again.  
Personally I really don't care about the price. I mined, I bought a nice decent amount of BTC, now I earn it with my work so my personal goal is to never touch again fiat. So far from 2015 until now I am doing better and better...  
People should stop focusing in speculation and start focusing in how to use BTC every day as money. Not the exchange price of BTC is important, but the purchasing power of Bitcoin. Then the fiat state will fall like a house of cards... it's already falling but people still don't want to see it.

The war on Bitcoin just started guys. Why you don't want to understand that the banksters now will start doing this with ALL "regulated" exchanges?

These exchanges have only one purpose: collect user data.

As I said quadrillion times here: STOP USING THOSE FUCKING CARDS. Those are fiat cards and ALWAYS will be fiat cards with fiat regulations/fees/features/logging/tracking etc.  
Those cards are created by the banksters to fool you NOT to use your BTC wallet and keep you in line continuing to use fiat money.  
I live on NTC for more than a year and I NEVER USE A FIAT CARD. It is possible if you start making happening in your community. Start local, around you.  
For more we still use fiat money for more we stay in the deep shit we are today.  
USE YOUR BTC WALLET AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!
Here are some tools very useful to live on BTC:  
 - almost anything you need you can buy online with BTC and other altcoins  
 if you find a shop that doesn't accept BTC, just use this tool to send them the link, they will pay for you in fiat and you pay them in BTC  
 - tons of stuff you can buy from Open Bazaar  
 - mobile version of Open Bazaar  
  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit  
 - recharge your phone credit  
  
  
  
 - buy/sell BTC, pay bills   
We have enough BTC in circulation, we can make this happen, you just need some determination: **FUCK THE BANKSTERS!**
@_date: 2016-11-14 10:08:01
**That card is a fiat card**. Not only that your financial privacy is violated with any use of that card, but will be more violated because is linked to a BTC address too, from where you fund that card.  
**Use your own BTC wallet**, don let the banksters to force you to use again fiat. Resist to financial surveillance!  
Now you can use your own BTC wallet to buy anything you like.  
No need for these fucking plastic cards!  
BTW Wirex is the defunct e-coin, remember e-coin :)?  
fiat = slavery, surveillance  
Bitcoin = freedom

Just patience, we have greedy miners that are not allowing to use your BTC to pay my bills, to buy stuff for living, to receive my salary. Maybe later a good miner will decide to accept the low/normal fees txs and your tx will get through, that depends on how much greed they have.  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.

In a wallet you can have millions of btc addresses, is not really necessary to create a new wallet for each transaction. But is recommended to use a new btc address every time you receive new coins.  
Electrum wallet (dektop/mobile) gives you more control over your addresses. You can do transactions one to many, many to one, many to many.  
To clarify: a BTC address is not a wallet.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank = act accordingly

Nope, any other altcoin is linked to the success of Bitcoin. All altcoins are just complimentary to Bitcooin, are NOT a replacement.  
If BTC is going down/out, all altcoins are going down/out and the fedcoin will take over. We have to understand this danger.   
Altcoins are good but not to replace BTC.

- check the design and text on their website, it's easy to find the scam in the message  
- check their responsiveness to contact or support

Of course is, SR and Coinbase are similar in manipulation techniques, because both have behind the same masters
  
I always said, from the beginning of the case: SR was an inside operation of FBI/CIA/NSA and pushed by the banksters, created, maintained, manipulated and using Ross like a patsy...
They have the resources, knowledge and the will to do that.
The goal was to demolish the trust in BTC and use SR like an example.
Just an example of how they operate:   
As I always said: Coinbase is a banksters "operation".

You don't belive that? Means you are living on another planet. Ignore my advice and you will pay the consequences later.  
I live only with BTC from 2015 and I closed all my bank accounts. I am prepared for anything worst that will happen. I know that this sounds crazy, but this is the truth. The shit we are living today cannot be fixed only with promises and lies. Can be fixed with a global war (real war) or a huge economic shift (Bitcoin). Next year 2017 will be decisive for this.

No I am not leaving BTC and more important NOT for fucking fiat. Never fiat again!  
I use LTC because I mined a lot back few years ago and now I can spend them for shopping where are accepted.  
I will use any altcoins that I can use them safe like P2P money.  
I don't mind to have BTC like reserve currency that I can exchange it quick for altcoins with that I can buy regular stuff. But today that is not possible. Still BTC is largely accepted.  
I used BTC from 2015 until today like P2P MONEY and works perfect for me for live totally on BTC. But seems that today BTC is hijacked for other interests.

[Satoshi papers]( right at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now this is not working like that. Now the "financial institution" are the miners.  
Also in the same papers is mentioned:  
"Permissionless: No arbitrary gatekeepers should ever prevent anybody from being part of the network (user, node, miner, etc)."  
Right now this is violated by miners, I am not allowed to use my money because of their greed.

I live on BTC from 2015 and I am just fine, free and happy.  
My only problem now is that some miners are not letting me to use my money in the permissionless way that was designed to be. So is not permissionless anymore.  
I really don't care if the blocks are 1-2-10-1000 MB or if the network is using segwit, rbf, ln, prt, srt, vrt or whatever other protocol or solution. If is secure, pseudonymous, borderless, permisionless, open-source and let me control my money and nobody can take my money, then for me Bitcoin is a success of the entire humanity.

I don't want to use other BS altcoins to do my usual txs. Bitcoin was from the beginning, just P2P money, but was hijacked by "smart guys" and convert it into something else, that is not money anymore. And for that the rest of the world don't want to jump into Bitcoin train, because is not attracted anymore. And soon the whole Bitcoin will fail just because of stupidity and miners greed.

Also you should really take in consideration to look into these:

WTF is this promoting VISA fucking fiat card on r/Bitcoin.  
Go to r/visa or r/fiat and promote the fucking cards!  
What is wrong with these people?! Instead of promoting Bitcoin your promote VISA and fiat?  
Wake up people! **Use your damn own BTC wallet, not any fiat shit card!**  
Do not let them fool you, all these cards are banskters tricks to keep in line of using their worthless fiat. Only by using their fiat (in any form) they can keep you slave. Break the chains and USE ONLY BTC!  
Today we don't need anymore these plastic cards full of shit. We have many places and marketplaces where you can shop directly with your BTC, secure, no snooping, no watching, with respect to your financial privacy. These cards are a direct violation to your financial privacy right!  
I am telling you now the benefits of using BTC and teh **risks** of fiat cards.  
**Payments with BTC wallet:**  
- secure, nobody can stole your identity or money - check  
- nobody will know your identity (payment processor, merchant, 3rd parties) - check  
- nobody can buy your identity and purchasing habits from payment processor (VISA, MC etc) - check  
- gov and banks can't seize your money - check  
- you don't have an age limit to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't need to give your identity to a bank or merchant to use a BTC wallet - check  
- you don't pay any fees to use the payment system (bank account, CC, payment network etc), just the transaction fee - check  
- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (can't spend more than you have) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):**  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity and money - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check

Not yet, but this will be the second wave of Bitcoin. Now we are focused on crushing the banksters. When they are out of the game, then the political mafia will not have support anymore from the banksters, so we will go after them too.  
Not sure if Bitcoin blockchain can do well that (voting), but I am sure we can create a special blockchain for that. Is about the identidity of each individual (voter) how to be linked to an unique address.  
Then this will used in the third wave, when Blockchain will be used to vote for projects not politicians, because the politicians will be long gone, not needed anymore. We will keep just few clerks so the administrative apparatus can serve the people.  
Politicians are a plague of society and in special now in a digital era, are useless for the society.  
Everybody is talking about the danger that robots will take place people's jobs. I will say **in a digital era, a blockchain era, politicians are in danger, in extinction, because now people can vote for themselves directly for projects they need for their society not for politicians!**
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:30:31
nope are NOT. Are created to fool you to think you use BTC but in fact no, are to keep you using fiat.  
Those cards are a huge wall against adoption because in that way merchants will NEVER accept your BTC, so there is NO adoption.  
I strongly suggest you to think again and use that card only in extremely urgency and try to pay ONLY with your BTC wallet.  
For example here you can buy groceries with BTC directly and that is full adoption of BTC:   
From 2015 I buy almost every day with BTC (wallet to wallet) from a grocery store on my street and that is adoption, not paying with a fucking fiat card.

Yes, when I genereated that wallet and I saw that contain the word "satoshi" I was amazed about the luck so I decided to make that wallet a big repository in front of everybody.

Why should I run my 5 nodes when for years AntPool is mining empty blocks for rewards and I get nothing to run the nodes?! Miners and nodes are both part of the network. If the fucking greedy miner doesn't accept my low/normal fee why should I continue using my resources to run a node for nothing?  
When the network will not allow miners to mine empty blocks or at least to not give them any reward for that and/or nodes will get incentive, then maybe I will start them again.  
I could run more than 5 nodes for years, I have resources, but why should I do it if others are fucking with us?

Bitcoin is demanded so much now because is in the hype period of the running price and many weak mind people are attracted to buy BTC like an "investment"/get rich scheme. But once they will see that BTC is not used so much as money, they will start losing their "investment" and realized that Bitcoin **is strong as money** not as investment.  
If we do not find a way to pass this bottleneck of fees, our train will fail dramatically and the banksters are just waiting that at the corner with their fucking fedcoin.  
**high fees = Bitcoin is not permissionless anymore**

You see many people think that is all about avoiding taxes, but IS NOT. Financial privacy IS NOT avoiding taxes!  
[Privacy is a human right. Secrecy is a privilege of power](  
The whole point of Bitcoin is to keep safe your financial privacy not to avoid taxes or buy drugs or guns. Financial privacy is your right, the same right like freedom of speech.  
There are many alternatives out there and one of the best is bitsquare.io, a P2P decentralized exchange. People don't even think about the power of a decentralized P"P exchange and always look only for convenience and lower price.  
But what price we pay for our freedoms, for our rights?  
I would love to see in each country an exchange like bitsquare but for the moment we have only one and is working great.  
Other altearnatives? ATMs, vouchers, in person trades or any other still free exchanges. Here is a list of 40+ places. Don't tell me that you never heard of anything than Coinbase and Circle. Bitcoin can be acquired in many ways.  
Me, for example, from 2015 until now I never had to buy anymore Bitcoin. I EARN IT! I am paid in BTC for my work. I live on BTC.  
Your employer still can't pay you in BTC directly? No problem, you can use these services to get in a fast an cheap way your wage converted in BTC directly with no hassle:  
  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit  
 - pay bills Thailand
  
  
  
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:02:48
That's a distraction :) Is better to make the agents think that I am crazy dude, so others can really have that information I share.  
60-70% of users on reddit are paid agents to monitor, deceive or manipulate posts. I know they are watching me but I don't care. [Read carefully this and you will understand]( Nothing here is 100% safe.  
I don't expect that all people will believe everything I would say here, but at least some of them will wake up and go and investigate for themselves, I am giving them just a clue, enough to start thinking for themselves and stop doing blindly what others said.

Soon they will learn that the greedy miners act like the banksters: censoring their txs and pushing for higher fees.  
If they read [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"   
And will say, hey this is great, but actually is not working like that anymore, because some "smart guys" hijacked the Bitcoin network to use in their own interest - more fees.
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:48:14
Thanks for you long reply, I really appreciate when somebody bother to answer me in a nice matter and try to have a reasonable opinion.  
I saw that LaBitconf when was first time on YT. I always watch all videos and conferences about Bitcoin.  
I understand your explanation but that doesn't make Bitcoin to work, right now. Believe me I am with all for Bitcoin, my heart, my mind, my hope, I closed all my bank accounts, no fiat anymore, all BTC, but when I see that is not working like it was designed to be, really disappoint me, not because I was fool to believe, but because people don't see it like the only way to go to the other side of the tunnel.  
I really want that Bitcoin will go through all these problems but seeing that the majority of bitcoiners are focused ONLY on making quick money and using BTC like a get-rich scheme, makes me throw up, I consider this the biggest mistake of humanity and instead we should focus on making Bitcoin the best invention of humanity, the real P2P money that humanity tries to have from the beginning, when we trade with shells but we haven't until now the digital option.

I live on BTC from 2015 and I use almost every day BTC. No more fiat... So you are wrong.  
Bitcoin will not be adopted ONLY because the economies, banks, stocks are plummeting... Bitcoin is just another option for those who have the eyes/mind open and get out from fiat slavery...  
Stop considering Bitcoin to be an exclusive speculation item and start considering your only way to freedom.  
You want adoption?! Start living on BTC, convince many merchants to accept your BTC, convince your employer to pay you in BTC, sell stuff (products and services) ONLY for BTC. Then you will have adoption. Not Trump, not segwit, not Pirate Party, not traders (aka speculators) will make Bitcoin to be adopted, but YOU and any other individual that start using BTC every day and dump the fiat.

I setup one of my wallets that is hidden in plain sight: in a nice picture on the wall, that hide a code for a wallet passphrase. That picture I have it also stored on a website and in several personal NAS.  
Nobody knows that the picture store 15BTC, not even my wife.

The question is what you want to do:  
- you want just to buy some BTC?  
- you want to start trading?  
For both, there are many ways to do it, here is a list, but is **NOT** including Coinbase (for several reasons):  
 - P2P decentralized exchange, **strongly recommended**  
  
 - ATM list  
 - US &amp; Canada, integrated into Mycelium and Airbitz wallets  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
  
  
 - instant buy with cards and vouchers  
 - instant buy with cards and vouchers  
 - buy instant with debit, cash, flexepinin CA  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
  
 - no registration  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU

There are many reasons why you should do through a mining pool:  
- moving a large amount of BTC through an established exchange, will  make huge moves into prices (artificially)  
- exchanges usually have limits per transaction  
- ignoring your financial privacy will have huge consequences later, is like ignoring your right for freedom of speech, that is one of the reasons I will not recommend you to use an "established" exchange  
- mining pools, always have that large amount ready to be sold and the transaction remain between 2 parties  
- there are many voices that this transaction should be on public exchanges so will be "visible" into the total fiatleak but in my opinion is that **your money are your money** and nobody have to see what you are doing with your money.  
- you should use an escrow service for security like   
- yes you can contact them directly by sending an email  
- I don't have any recommendation because I never have to buy a large amount of BTC, personally I earn them, I work for bitcoins so no need for me to buy. But many of them have bank accounts in US for sure.

- lost [9 trillions from FED]( (also our taxes)  
- lost another 6.5 trillions in [military funding](  
- lost track of [Irak war billions](  
- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [all taxes goes to military complex]( - how many roads, hospitals, schools etc can be built with these trillions?    
- pay taxes to [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](  
[- pay taxes so the gov can tax me rain water and ponds on my property?](  
- pay taxes to build railroads [that later GM dismantle them to push their agenda of heavy use of cars](

You can build your own:  
Technical Details:  
Using client-side JavaScript, your passphrase is run through the memory-intensive scrypt key derivation function (N=218, r=8, p=1, dkLen=32) to generate a secret key.  
Your secret key is used to encrypt your notepad with AES256 encryption. The ciphertext (encrypted notepad) is sent along with a SHA256 hash of your secret key to the server for storage.  
When you retrieve your notepad, your SHA256 hash is sent to the server, and the ciphertext is returned. The ciphertext is decrypted using your secret key, revealing your notepad.  
Passphrase.io was inspired by the concept of the Bitcoin briainwallet, which allows you to store money in your brain by memorizing a passphrase.

1. If you can't mine, you don't have BTC to "trade". You will need to buy them, work and be paid in BTC, sell something for BTC.  
So let's get started with the beginning.  
First you really need to read, watch, listen more about Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-12-31 11:15:47
When people will understand that only by using a P2P decentralized exchange the user is in full control of his money and orders? And nobody will manipulate the market?  
A P2P decentralized exchanges is exactly like the Byzantine Generals dilemma.  
But yet people prefer to fooled with these so called "regulated exchanges" that 90% are controlled and manipulated by the banksters.  
Think again...  
I know I know, I will get lots of downvotes for this (there is a lot of pressure from those exchanges here), I don't care, but at least my words go to those who want to listen.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:07:21
No, this is stupid.  
If somebody will buy all the bitcoins and not using them, the rest of people will not want it anymore and that somebody will stick with his bitcoins converted in loses.  
Bitcoin doesn't need to go to any Moon, Bitcoin needs to be used as was designed: **P2P decentralized money**, otherwise will cease to exist!  
Bitcoin wasn't created to make some bunch of people rich from speculations (there are many other methods for that). Bitcoin was created to help people **to get rid of all those banksters fuckers that ruined this world!**
@_date: 2016-12-20 09:33:05

If you are dumb enough to show the world that you owns a lot of BTC, yes you are a target. If you stay calm and just be a normal person, nobody will notice that you have hidden in your HW/paper/steganography wallets a fortune.  
Bad guys will go as usual where they know there is a stash: banks, exchanges, people with large public wallets etc.  
Even if a stupid drunk attacker will put a gun on your head,  is working on a solution for hidden wallets. So you will give them shit and remain with your stash and your life.
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:22:25

Both. I watched closely what is happening in Bitcoinlandia from 2012 and who is acting in this space, why, how.  
Many people here don't pay attention to the details, of what is going on and they are taken by the hype of BTC price, media crazy, ad shills etc. But they lose one big aspect: banksters will never let Bitcoin to get the masses or at least with a price or an exit for them. Banksters know that they can't control Bitcoin protocol, but they know how to control people's minds, habits, manipulate them to keep them in line.  
Just think for a min, if you are a bankster and you have all the power in this world, you will let so easy that Bitcoin will win? You will just sit there and launch some trash media campaigns against Bitcoin or you will do something for real to stop it, because you have that power (infinite fiat money supply, laws, govs, media etc).   
But yet [Bitcoin is the Honey Badger]( (this is from 3 years ago!) and nothing will stop it!

I would love to have a pool that deal only with low fees, but I am not a miner anymore.  
Somebody in the miners community that still love Bitcoin (not only money) should do that if they really want Bitcoin to go forward, otherwise... in 1 year we can say adios to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-14 10:03:24
The fact that you tried only 2 of the worst places doesn't mean the whole process of buying BTC is a hassle.

Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:

The best wallet is that one that gives you full control of your keys.  
  
In other words: stay away from "bitcoin banks" like Coinbase and other exchanges. **Never** use an exchange wallet to be your personal wallet.  
There are many good wallets out there, I recommend you to test some of them and see which suits better for your habits, needs, likes etc. There is no best wallet, each one have specific features and uses.  
Here is a good comparison of wallets:  
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:14:44
I always consider meaningless to report BTC value to worthless goat shit fiat. MEANS NOTHING.  
When adoption/use of BTC is more than 50% of all other payment systems, that means fiat is history so... is useless to think about marketcap BS.
@_date: 2016-11-27 17:25:03
I never said that the fees should be zero. But promoting high fees is not correct also.  
[Satoshi papers]( right at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now this is not working like that. Now the "financial institution" are the miners.  
Also in the same papers is mentioned:  
"Permissionless: No arbitrary gatekeepers should ever prevent anybody from being part of the network (user, node, miner, etc)."  
If the big miners are not happy with their gains from fees I invite them to shut down their facilities and go home. There will be so many others happy to start their personal rigs (gpu, usb, small asics) at home and maintain the mining with low fees. Nobody ask the big miners to buy and build so big facilities that have huge costs of mining. Their only greed for more money was pushing them to do that.

anyone, is just code, paste it into a text widget.  
Or just paste your BTC address + QR code image. You don't need a fancy pantsy popup to get some satoshis...

Sorry, I would love to buy some food with BTC (I usually do, because I live on BTC), but we have greedy miners that are not allowing me to use my BTC to buy stuff for living, to receive my salary, to buy Black Friday offers etc.  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.  
Please add a Bitcoin accepted here sign on the bottom of your page, so all people can see that you accept BTC.

Yes, I live on BTC for more than a year now. The "BTC volatility" can be a problem, but not so big like venezuelan bolivar, or argentinian peso. The "volatility" we are talking is about 5-10% in a month? This is nothing.  
Yes can be concerning if you live day by day with what you earn.  
Luckily I am an early adopters and miners and my "reserves" help me to live on BTC, without using any kind of fiat. Yes I closed my bank accounts long time ago, I don't want to  hear anymore about fiat, but this is not easy. Is just determination to fight against banksters and this will be the future for my kids that I am paving the way now, later they will harvest the results.  
Each person should find his way how to live only on BTC, each person lives in a different place, where not all people around accept BTC. But this is a bout how is your determination to convince other people to use BTC.  
The Bitcoin Revolution starts from the bottom not from the top...

This is an old discussion and there are solutions. Maybe I don't know so deep how Bitcoin works, but that doesn't mean we should do NOTHING or just accuse me that I should not say anything because I don't know about BTC. That will not make the problem to go away...  
**It IS a problem and should be fixed.**

@_date: 2016-12-28 11:14:16
Put more keywords for your products. I tried some specific keywords on  and  and I couldn't find your shop.  
When you create a shop/product, think how what other people that doesn't know anything about you or what you sell, will put in the search bar. So those keys set for your products.

There is no such of term in Bitcoinlandia "safer bitcoin website".  
We use to say: **Don't trust, verify** that applies also for bitcoin websites.  
You want to buy BTC? Then remember this: [If you control your bitcoin keys, it is your bitcoins. If you don't control your keys, it is NOT your bitcoins.](  
Wallets that comply this function and also to buy in are Airbitz, Mycelium, Blockchain.info (BCI), Jaxx, Exodus.  
But also I strongly recommend you to buy from an exchange like Bitsquare.io, a P2P decentralized exchange that offer you full control of your money and identity.

Satoshi was smart: give us the solution and withdraw (supposedly). Now is our duty about how we continue to use/control this legacy/invention and not let it to slip into wrong hands, because if that happen, there is no other way back or escape way, we are doomed to be forever slaves/robots/useless/controlled sheeple.  
It's now or never!
@_date: 2016-11-01 20:33:47
Nope. I said goodbye to all fiat. That card is not an insurance policy, is death will testament. You use/accept it = you continue to be pegged to fiat. You reject it, you have a chance to get out of slavery.  
Fiat = slavery  
Bitcoin = freedom  
There is no other way. For more we continue this for more we are in deep shit. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!  
The banksters want exactly this "transition" to have more time find a way to fool people again with their tricks.  
Don't you see the whole debate and fight with small/big blocks, scaling, segwit, LN etc is just to divide and conquer, to win more time to find a solution to weak the minds and push for a "fedcoin" to be the "only one solution".  
The whole world is manipulated by the well known: PROBLEM - REACTION - SOLUTION path... They create the problem, wait for people's reaction, come with the "solution".

Bitcoin IS money. [Wikipedia explain it to you here.](  
"Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form.[citation needed] The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money."

- no chargebacks or double spends or skimming your card - check  
- no debt slavery (spending more than you have) - check  
**Payments with VISA/plastic cards (there is no such thing of Bitcoin debit cards):**  
- insecure, everybody can stole your identity - check  
- everybody knows your identity (payment processor, bank, merchant, 3rd parties, gov etc) - check  
- any marketing company or gov can buy/obtain your purchasing habits (bulk or individual) from the payment processor (VISA) - check  
- gov and banks can seize your money - check  
- gov, banks and 3rd parties can trace your movements, shopping habits, places you move/buy, almost anything about you - check  
- you have an age limit to use freely a bank account and/or plastic card - check  
- you have to prove to the merchant your identity (using a PIN or showing ID) - check  
- you pay many fees (CC annual fee, bank account annual fee, merchant fee, network fee, all these are hidden but you are paying them anyway) - check  
- chargebacks, double spends, skimming - check  
- debt slavery for life (you always fall into getting credits to fund those cards and you never go out from this debt) - check

What are you waiting for? That the landlord, gas station, grocery invite you to pay with BTC. That will NEVER happen if you don't help them to do it.  
I did it in 2015 and now all those around me accept my BTC.  
Every time you use fiat, you are part of funding wars, corruption, lies, slavery. Because this is fiat. Let's change this by using BTC only.

**Always** you will pay until 10% markup for your privacy when is about to buy BTC. You want cheap BTC? Work for bitcoins, be paid in BTC or using bitwage.com or cashila.com.  
Try an B-ATM next time. You will find ones that request your foto/ID, or some don't. Those that doesn't request your identity will have at least 6-10% markup, [like this ones]( But that is the price for your financial privacy. Later you will appreciate it more than now.

- Coinomi - 7/10, too many cryptos and many are trash and is only for 1 platform

Use P2P decentralized exchanges, ATM, localbitcoins, Mycelium local trader, sell products and services on OpenBazaar or... work for bitcoins. Soon we will have 16 million BTC in circulation (mined), enough to start a real economy.  
Stop using fiat in any way (cash, plastic cards, bank accounts) and even close your bank accounts (I did that in 2015).

Multibit HD can use many other seeds from different wallets. I tested with Mycelium and Electrum and works.  
But yes, you will have to check first which BIP they support.  
But from now on you will see wallet implementations for dual use desktop/mobile more often.  
Jaxx, Electrum, BCI, Copay and others already have this feature (to pair desktop/mobile the same wallet) and is quite handy to have them in dual mode.  
Here is a nice comparison of wallets:

 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
 - sorry for your problem with them but they still are a good exchange  
  
  
 - instant buy with cards and vouchers  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards

So people stop dreaming, fiat will be gone if BTC pass $2000. Nobody will sell anymore his BTC for that worthless goat shit, so is really meaningless to think that you will be rich in something that worth NOTHING.

Why should I run my 5 nodes when for years AntPool is mining empty blocks for rewards and I get nothing to run the nodes?! Miners and nodes are both part of the network. If the fucking greedy miner doesn't accept my low/normal fee why should I continue using my resources to run a node for nothing?  
When the network will not allow miners to mine empty blocks or at least to not give them any reward for that and/or nodes will get incentive, then maybe I will start them again.  
I could run more than 5 nodes for years, I have resources, but why should I do it if others are fucking with us?

Great article by Jeffrey Tucker!  
"*At first glance, bitcoin would seem to be an exception. You can’t use a bitcoin for anything other than money. It can’t be worn as jewelry. You can’t make a machine out of it. You can’t eat it or even decorate with it. Its value is only realized as a unit that facilitates indirect exchange. And yet, bitcoin already is money. It's used every day. You can see the exchanges in real time. It's not a myth. It's the real deal.*"

 - Fore example this one also have a 9% markup, but you don't need any registration, just go to an ATM put the cash and you receive instant BTC.  
 - Is at reverse, send BTC and get the cash from almost any ATM in EU  
I recommend you also to look into  and  you can receive your wage in fiat (like usual) but you get it converted into BTC at a better rate than buying from localbitcoins or the hassle of using exchanges.  
Then also from your Mycelium wallet, you can use the Cashila plugin to pay your bills directly with your BTC.  
Also these are used to pay bills with BTC:  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit  
  
  
  
 - buy/sell BTC, pay bills

The best safe for your BTC is your own wallet.  
NONE of other services can guarantee 100% that your money are safe. Why? Because of this:    
Your own BTC wallet is the most legit, safe, fast, trusted place to keep your BTC keys. To remember: Your bitcoins ALWAYS stays on the blockchain, nobody take them, but what you have in your wallet are the keys of the ownership of those bitcoins. So if you lose the control of your keys, you lose the control of your bitcoins.  
**You have been warned, don't come back here and complain that you didn't know**

@_date: 2016-11-27 15:14:49
Holly crap now I have a post created about me. Guys I am just a bitcoiner that wants Bitcoin to thirve, no need to much "honor" :) Geeze now I am an "extremist", tomorrow I will be labeled like terrorist just because I want Bitcoin to win. What's next? CNN announce that BTC_Forever is an extreme dangerous individual that want to destroy the world...  
So if I want to use Bitcoin like money (like was designed to be) now I am an "extremist"....  
**Bitcoin is P2P money - Bitcoin is P2P money - Bitcoin is P2P money!**  How many times we have to remember that Satoshi created Bitcoin to be P2P money?! Bitcoin if is NOT used like money will lose faith in time and people will not use it anymore so all those speculators will lose again.  
Bitcoin need to be used like P2P money in order to thrive!  
That's why banksters are so scared about Bitcoin because Bitcoin will destroy them!  
And now you revealed your true face - **BANKSTER!**  
**EDIT: I want to announce in this way my personal position to be clear for all:**  
- I am not taking any side in the blocksize "debate" (see my history, never get into this "false debate")  
- I really don't care the size of the blocks, I want only that Bitcoin works like was designed: pure P2P money, permisonsless  
- I really don't care what more protocols are/will be implemented (segwith, rbf, grt, pert, vrt whatever initials will be) as Bitcoin works it was designed: P2P money, permisionless, secure, pseudonymous, borderless etc.  
- I want that Bitcoin will replace the actual banking system with a P2P banking system, money to be controlled by people not by central banks, govs etc  
- I want that Bitcoin or whatever other crypto to replace at least 90% of the actual gov apparatus with a kind of DAO or direct democracy (people vote for projects not for corrupt individuals). We don't need so many corrupt individual to not "represent" us in political instituttions. Is USELESS.  
**This is NOT anarchy, is limited gov. I see the use of a minimal gov, with clerks and functionaries that can help people to obtain information and help from society, not to DECIDE my life.**  
- I want Bitcoin to thrive because will STOP all wars! Wars can't be funded with BTC, wars are funded only with fiat, because fiat is having those particular features that allow to fund wars, corruption etc. That's way govs and banksters HATE Bitcoin, just because is open and everybody can see what they will spend from our **voluntary** taxation. Forced taxation is funding wars, let's be clear. 90% of all taxes goes to wars, military complex, corruption etc.  
- I want Bitcoin to thrive because **Bitcoin = Innovation**. Just look to the last 8 years, how many amazing innovation around Bitcoin are popping up all around the world. You have to be real blind not to see these.  
- I am not part of ANY political party, group or association, I don't represent any company, I am just a freelancer, a free individual.  
- I am not supporting any company that is against the basic rules of Bitcoin. But I will support and recommend all those companies that are helping Bitcoin to thrive (but watch out, any simple error from this path and I will not recommend it anymore). I am vigilant.

**We can't buy anymore stuff from OB because we have  greedy miners that are not allowing us to do so**  
I remember to everybody to read [Satoshi papers]( where is stipulated at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: miners limiting the amount of fee.
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:33:30
Ah no worry, are just some greedy miners that are violating a basic rule of Bitcoin:  
"Permissionless: No arbitrary gatekeepers should ever prevent anybody from being part of the network (user, node, miner, etc)."  
And also don't want you to use Bitcoin like was designed:  
[Satoshi papers]( right at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Miners are violating right now one of those prohibited changes in Bitcoin protocol:

You get used to use fake money. Bitcoin is not fake. You can't spend what you don't have. Businesses will adapt.  
When you get from visa the money for something that didn't arrived, means you use fake money, Visa is advancing you a IOU, not money. Visa is taking also an IOU from the buyer, again fake money. So all are using fake money.

**Bitcoin IS MONEY**. Do you need more explanations? -----&gt;read the getting started right panel
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:41:08
Yeah we have a wonderful network: I donated $1 and I paid almost the same amount in fees to greedy miners. Cheap money!
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:27:02
Nice collection.  
But none of those videos explain that you can't use your money because there are some greedy miners that are "disrupting" the Bitcoin network by filtering the txs and acting like gatekeepers like the banksters. Bitcoin network IS NOT permisionless anymore!  
Min 1:45 - 1st misleading: "Bitcoin is completely decentralized, it doesn't rely on banks, on govs and anybody". But just rely on greedy miners that are filtering your txs.  
Min 2:00 - 2nd misleading: "Bitcoin is digital money, exactly like €, $ etc". But was hijacked by some greedy miners that converted into a commodity, to be speculated like store of value. We have gold for that, we don't need another commodity, we need money to be used in an unrestricted way.  
Min 2:30 - 3rd misleading: "One person send 100 million dollars, **in 1 sec, for zero fee**!". WTF I just heard?!  
And the I can continue like that with the whole video...  
Maybe I should start taking his book "The Internet of Money" and take one by one his paragraphs and give an answer based on todays facts that are contradictory with all what he says.  
I am sorry Andreas u/andreasma, I was your best fan, but seems that now, all you said is a big lie and misleading people. I am very disappointed about the whole Bitcoin community, devs, and greedy miners. I put all my hope into Bitcoin but seems that was hijacked into something else..  
Satoshi papers right at the beginning: "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution".  
I am really pissed off because Bitcoin was hijacked and betrayed my hope in it. This is outrageous.
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:38:01
It's fake. Think again.  
Did you tried to go to a bank and request a credit of 100k or more but to be delivered in cash, in the moment?  
None of banks will give those money, because they don't have them. Will just give a paper where will be mentioned: you are credited with x money in your account.  
THOSE MONEY DOESN'T EXIST! So are fake. Worst then monopoly money.  
A bank can print/create money out of thin air and nothing will happen. But if you will do that you go to jail...  
Here is a funny way to understand how fiat works 
@_date: 2016-11-10 21:56:54
12voip.com accept BTC
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:41:45
@_date: 2016-12-12 19:22:53
Mark my words and I know I will get downvoted like hell for this, but I don't care. Please somebody save this post for later.  
Banksters know how to manipulate the BTC price. When BTC reach $1000, pushed by them, they will crush it again. They know that if BTC goes more than $1000/BTC nothing will stop it to go to 2000-3000 and that is their death sentence.  
This price race is by design, but don't be scared, Bitcoin will never die, if you use it everyday like money and skip the fiat. Only that way we can crush them.

Bitsquare is not owned/controlled by nobody, decentralized like Bitcoin. You are ALWAYS in control of your funds.  
Bitstamp have "insiders" from Goldman Sachs. Is a "regulated" exchange, means act like a trading bank. You are NOT in control of your funds.  
Conclusion is yours.
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:09:37
It's simple: I work for bitcoins, I am paid in bitcoins and I pay all my spends in bitcoins (rent, bills, groceries, gas etc). There are many shops, merchants that accept BTC and most of my spends are online. Many services like cashila.com that pays your bills and you pay in BTC.  
Everything start by being paid in BTC.

That shirt is now a big fucking lie (according to some): Bitcoin is not anymore "Internet Money", is just a commodity to be speculated, a "store of value" but without value. Bitcoin will never have value if is NOT used like money.  
Today we cannot use BTC like Magic Internet Money because was hijacked by greedy miners!

No thanks, I have my own BTC wallets, no need another intermediary that will track my movements (even if they say they will not track).  
Bitcoin was created exactly for this: to NOT have any intermediary between parties of a trade.
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:57:41
I think you don't understand correctly but Bitcoin as payment method **IS** the business solution. A payment with Bitcoin doesn't need ANY intermediary, is wallet to wallet.  
Now that you want to convert it into fiat directly is another story, but I strongly recommend you DO NOT convert it anymore in fiat.  
Nowaday you can use Bitcoin to buy many things you need and even bills, wages etc. so why not keep them and pay with BTC what you need or just hold them.    
  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills

Did you really didn't saw any of the warnings here or over the internet about Coinbase?  
Ok you end up in the famous list:  
  
Coinbase is the last place on Earth from where you should buy your BTC and not even talking about NOT using that wallet like a personal wallet. Coinabse is a BANK run by banksters!

Oh yeah, a "little competition" to give up more info about you, after they have ALL your info.  
**Why should I tell you more about me?** To give up that info to "3rd parties"?  
This is the way how companies are sneaking into your life.  
Using 3rd party apps like Wirex and their cards is just giving more info about you and there is 1000% chance that this will end in violation of your financial privacy, EXACTLY like happen with Coinbase...  
**You have been warned!**  
Wake up people, do not give up your personal info to whatever company, that for sure will give that info to your gov/banksters. Use ONLY your personal BTC wallet, no 3rd party wallets, no plastic cards. Only like that you keep your financial privacy safe! If you don't care about your financial privacy means you give up your other rights too, like freedom of speech.
@_date: 2016-11-17 15:53:59
Your bitcoin are already money with value, you don't need to look at the BTC/fiat price.  
Keeping your bitcoins in Coinbase = guaranteed you lose those bitcoins or you are tracked for what you are using them.

Did you tell them also that we have greedy miners that are not allowing them to use their BTC to buy stuff for living, to receive salary, to pay bills, because they will have to pay a higher fee for living and using their P2P money?  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.

Nope, banks was created/invented first of all to keep your gold coins in their vaults and paid a rent for that. Then they get smart and print more IOUs and give you "loans" with fake/fictitious money, but with empty vaults. You gold was gone and you never had the chance to get back your real money!  
Banks are the most evil in this moment and Bitcoin is here to fix that.

I have 5 servers sharing extra space with Storj. So far works quite good, I have contracts and peers connected so that means people are using it. Each end of month I receive the payment for sharing and is not bad at all. It covers my tx fees for other BTC payments :)  
Of course is a great service, is encrypted, decentralized, I think is the same idea like Piped Piper concept from serie "Sillicon Valley".  
For thos who want to share is recommended to keep your sharing client open 24/7 so a regular PC will not give you so much.  
Will be nice to have a Storj client for NAS (Qnap or Synology), where the market is larger than regular PC/Servers.  
I am not a fan of keeping personal data on public clouds, but this Storj seems to be the perfect solution for encrypted data on cloud. The user have total control of his data and is not stored in a central data storage like other clouds.  
The future is DECENTRALIZED and ENCRYPTED.

I think this is a situation exactly like the one in Greece: people are trapped, they can't use their fiat money, so they can't buy BTC and get out from this shit.

What if we create a daily or weekly pinned topic, based on an actual important event, subject, issue etc. for Bitcoin itself and how is affecting it?  
We see many times news repeated over and over here and the comments split into pieces.  
Example: India - cashless society. You see every hour posted again and again from different sources the same news. Is boring. Make a sticky post with only once news and inside post all the links and comments based on that subject.

"*the people interested in BTC are just hoping to cash out at a high price. LIKE STOCKS.*"  
This is a stupid conception. These people are morons. Is like buying stocks from a company that doesn't exist and also that company do NOTHING and you are expecting to have profits.  
Stocks for companies that not doing anything have a name: SCAMS.  
But Bitcoin is NOT a company, is just MONEY and people forget this: Satoshi created Bitcoin to be a free P2P money, not stocks.  
Bitcoin, in order to have more and more value **need to be used as MONEY, for P2P trades for good and services**, otherwise will fail dramatically.  
But you know what? All this hype to be a store of value, stocks or whatever, is a false idea pushed into people minds, exactly by banksters (the masters of market manipulations) like masters of puppets.  
Bitcoin will win against the banksters ONLY by using it like MONEY!  
We have to go back to history and see why gold was used like money? Not because was firstly store of value, but because was hard to counterfeit, lack of existence, easy to carry and exchange all over the world. Then later when was used more and more created his value.

I have a serious question too: why the fuck you used Coinbase after so many warnings NOT to do it?
@_date: 2016-12-31 10:48:36
I used Brave (testing purposes) and this is my feedback (if there is somebody from theme here to hear):  
- I always check for updates and do them  
- the background image makes the browser to load very slow, remove it or give me option to take it out  
- the last visited pages stays in a small icons tray, saving the logins and user data. I couldn't find how to remove that. That is not part of user security! I don't want to save any of my previous session in the browser. That means that my browser history stays forever on disk and that is NOT security  
- I played with the switch for Brave or 3rd party ads to be shown and there is no difference. So come up the question, from where I get paid to see ads?  
- so far is a fair browser, not best not bad, just regular. But yes, we have to give them time to make it better and send reasonable feedbacks

my btc security is my concern. I use any type of wallet that gives me full control of my keys. Never use a web wallet.  
From when I started with btc in 2012 never get robbed/hacked. Only ignorant people get hacked/robbed. Bitcoin wallets offer enough security and if you are careful with handle them all is safe.  
Bitcoin = be your own bank = act accordingly. I use mobile, desktop, hardware and stenographic wallets (passphrase.io is very handy with that)

The whole "drama" of IRS-Coinbase match is a masquerade. You will see it later...  
[Coinbase was created by the banksters]( ESPECIALLY for this, it was like a little experiement, to see how gov can TAX bitcoiners. So they fooled lot of people to get into Coinbase and then... BAM!  
Even if Coinbase people doesn't know about this plan (I doubt it) the fact that a big bank is behind them should be a huuuuge alarm signal. But people are too brainwashed and ignore the warnings, they are excited about quick profits and easiest to buy BTC but they never think about consequences. And when I always warn about this, they ignore me or consider me a troll, a crazy fuck or whatever. But I just wanted to warn them to help them.  
Remember this: Coinbase is not the only one tool created/managed by banksters. Banksters will do everything possible to slow down or even stop the adoption of BTC by using deceiving techniques, manipulations, shills, nice marketing campaigns, EVERYTHING that they can do, they have UNLIMITED money by endless printing/creating so they don't care how much they have to pay for these "services".

bitwage.com or cashila.com are great tools for receiving fiat and be converted in BTC for your services/work.  
Bitwage I think also now have a tool for invoicing, not sure but worth to check.  
Cashila.com is a bridge, you put on your invoice to be paid to cashila bank account, with a reference to your user account, then you receive the money in your cashila account and you can withdraw them in BTC straight to your personal BTC wallet.  
For those who pay me directly in BTC I use to make invoices, expressed in fiat value, but I insert a footnote with a QR code and an BTC address to be paid. Nothing about banks or other BS.  
Not sure if this is what you was looking for.  
Another one that come to my mind close to what you ask can be:

- banks will create their own "[fedcoin]( with total control, no financial privacy

You are wrong. The whole point of Bitcoin adoption is that people can have places and ways to spend their BTC. Once that is done, grandmas will do the rest don't worry. My mom (almost 70) is using BTC wallet because she saw that need to learn that in order to save her pension.  
I start spending only in BTC because mainly I start getting paid in BTC from 2015. So I had to convince everyone around me to accept my BTC. And believe me none of those says that using BTC wallet is harder than a fucking visa card.  
Bitcoin is not about convenience, is about to get rid of banksters, to be free, is about a form of expression, a protest, a run away from a corrupt and evil system. When you start to realize that, then you see the true power of Bitcoin. You fool yourself with those cards thinking that is a transition way. When you have a gangrene on your leg you are not taking pills thinking to live another day, you just cut the leg where is still alive, to be able to live more.  
And this is Bitcoin, is a drastic way but is the correct way if you want to live free.

I think I already explained to you before my opinion on Exodus. I was very excited to use it when I saw it. Consider my criticism a good will for you so you can make it better, I have nothing against your wallet.  
But from the beginning:  
- I intent to download it from different IPs/proxies, only one in the end let me to download it without errors, and took long time, because it's big 180MB.  
- for a wallet, I think is too big 180MB (if you can explain a bit why is so big)  
- after installing is even more ~350MB  
- is loading slowly, yes with that size you don't expect to be fast  
- is looking nice the interface, promising and it gives a sensation of an exchange account  
- tried to make a backup of my keys: confusing process and in the end ask to pay a fee for that backup. So WTF, I don't even have some satoshis there and is asking to pay a fee?  
So right now is parked somewhere on my HDD, not used. Sorry man but you need to have a different approach.  
In my opinion, like a heavy user of BTC (I live on BTC from 2015) and I use many wallets, a wallet should be:  
- simple to use, not too much fancy BS interfaces, animations etc, like an email window  
- easy to carry wherever you are, on a USB, portable, self executable, multiplatform. I used to have a 2 GB USB encrypted, containing 2 wallet apps (Electrum+Multibit), copies of different wallet files and a password manager. Enough to carry with me wherever I am and open my wallets when I travel.  
- easy management of BTC addresses  
- easy backup of keys (passphrase and/or private keys)  
- PIN /password encryption to open the wallet (not only for transactions)  
- fees control by manual input not just high/normal/small  
- multiplatform, mobil/desktop, this combination is very useful.
- shapeshifting - jaxx did it in some way that is amazing, practically you don't need anymore an exchange to do that. Shapeshifting will be more and more used from now on, when many merchants will adopt other cryptos so each one will find a way to pay with other cryptos than BTC. But you need to do that in a simple, fast way.  
- merchant list: I see that this part wasn't used at the maximum potential. Only Airbitz and BCI have it integrated for the moment. But is a huge potential for all 3 parts (wallet provider, user, merchants). All 3 can win from this tool if is done correctly. I suggest to many wallet providers to start thinking about this.  
Example: I am wallet user, I have some BTC to spend and I am looking for some merchants close to me that can offer me nice discounts or promotions if I buy with BTC, in that day or moment. So the merchant will have an agreement with the wallet provider to push the ad to the closest user. The user accept the ad and get some satoshis bonus. The merchant pays the ad to the wallet provider that splits the commission with the user. In this way all 3 wins something: merchant - a new customer, wallet provider - commission from ads to sustain his wallet, user - new place to buy stuff wit BTC at a discount and a small incentive for accepting that ad. Look at searchtrade.com or brave.com or supload.com. This is a new way to make business - incentives and all parts win.  
In this way also the adoption of Bitcoin will be faster, users will be encouraged to spend their BTC from wallets not just HODL, that will make stronger Bitcoin.  
I hope I gave you enough information to take in consideration and to make a great wallet with Exodus.

Don't be fooled by the "nice surface"... everything is for a reason.  
All friction points, those "regulated" exchanges are designed to be an incrimination point. When the time will be right they will use all the information against you. Now they let people to buy BTC in a "regulated" way so they can use it against them later, when the fucking fedcoin will be ready. First they need to get rid of fiat cash (what they are doing now), next will be to promote their fedcoin to be the ONLY one "regulated" and accepted like money, thne they will start pointing to all BTC users (thet they already have their infos) to be the "bad guys" that don't want to pay their taxes, that they are only criminals and pedophiles using underground currency... etc

Nowadays we are giving up too easy our privacy and security for convenience.  
My personal advice? Start working for bitcoins and forget about buying BTC.  
Or just use services like these to receive your wages into BTC:  
  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - pay bills - EU  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills - EU, maybe CA, US, MEX  
 - EU  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills - CA  
 - pay bills, get wages - AUS  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit - PH  
 - pay bills Thailand - TH  
 - AUS  
 - international

Exactly, but you see seems that the greed corrupt everybody. Anybody new that hear about BTC wants to "trade" and get rich quick. That's the most stupid thing can happen.  
Satoshi gave us an impressive power and we are just trashing it like a  rusty can... If we miss this huge opportunity, humanity is doomed.

Let's see who will be the first in "recommending" Coinbase... 3,2,1... /s  
There is no "best place" to buy BTC. There are places that are violating your financial privacy and places that don't.  
No9w if you came to say that you don't care about your financial privacy I would say that why you care to have free speech, so go back to fiat, because fiat is violating every moment your financial privacy and your freedom of speech.  
So anyway I would recommend you some options, places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange, **strongly recommended**, this will never violate your rights  
  
 - ATM list  
 - US &amp; Canada, integrated into Mycelium and Airbitz wallets  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
  
  
 - instant buy with cards and vouchers  
 - instant buy with cards and vouchers  
 - buy instant with debit, cash, flexepinin CA  
  
 - no registration  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Another useful tools:  
 - receive your wage in btc, no more need to buy or use an exchange  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills

Bitcoin is our only hope NOT to be in that control grid.  
All you see today happening (Greece, Cyprus, Venezuela, Argentina, India) is a master plan to get you into their ultimate plan: total control nightmare.  
Who controls the money supply, controls the world...  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now is time for the people to continue his work, to continue to use ONLY Bitcoin, like P2P money and continue to control his own money.

Because this is taxation: a bill paid in advance with your money, without your approval.

I don't launder. I just use them in a secure, safe, anonymous way.  
Any service that "promote" laundering in fact is a trap.  
Do it yourself, there are many ways to shapeshift your bitcoins.  
Easy, quick way: shapeshift BTC -&gt; ALTS -&gt; new BTC addresses. This is recommended when you receive BTC linked to your real name. If you just receive them in an anonymous way, no need to do that.

Hey morons! Bitcoin is MONEY is not shares, bonds, commodities, or something to "invest in".  
You buy BTC to have your future secure not to "invest"/sell later. Bitcoin is to save your REAL money not your wealth.  
In few years banksters will seize/control all your money or not even let you withdraw your money from a bank account. So putting your fiat money into BTC is securing your future that you can still have access to your money.  
NOBODY with brains that buy today BTC will NOT sell their BTC tomorrow, they keep them to be sure they will HAVE their money tomorrow.  
Bitcoin is NOT an investment, Bitcoin are future money.

It's a trap. Don't you know that Bitstamp is backed by Goldman Sachs? Also an exchange doesn't have future too long. All this drama now for buying BTC in exchanges will end, because we will see fiat being obsolete, people will earn BTC not buying all the time.  
Will survive those exchanges like Bitsquare, P2P decentralized and you will see many wallets adopting a way of shapeshifting cryptos. That is the future where you should invest. Or if you are already in bnktothefuture go for Airbitz wallet or any other projects that have a long future.

Look, I am using BTC from 2012, when I start mining with GPUs and some USBs rigs. I bought BTC all the time, from 2012, no matter the price was, just hold or use them to buy stuff (then buy back with a 10% more).  
But from  2015 I start earning BTC, being paid for my work in bitcoins. So I start also living on BTC only. I closed my bank accounts.  
All of this because I see in Bitcoin, the true way to be free and get rid of the banksters, corruption, slavery, wars, manipulated markets, lies etc. Bitcoin can wipe out all of these evils from entire world.  
That's why I started to help a lot of people around me and here. I am active on this subs from 2012, with different nicks (I change them many times and I park away the old ones) and I always try to wake up people. I never "promote" anything in my personal interest, I have no company affiliation (I am just a simple freelancer), I don't like to suggest any service or company if I don't truly believe that the company truly deserve to be mentioned here.   
All my intentions here are sincere and open, just to help people to understand the real value of Bitcoin and can do for each.

Education is the key to success. Leaving your customers in dark not educated about a new payment solution, you just continue the agony of fiat.  
I suggest the following scenario and make it clear for the customer to see and understand it:   
Let's say you have item price $10  
Make the price in fiat to be displayed $10+2% (or whatever is your visa charge %)  
Make the price in BTC to be $10  
Make some flyers with some simple indications on how to setup a BTC wallet and some places from where to buy BTC. Or just put a BTC ATM in your shop and let them buy some BTC. Or just sell them some BTC directly.  
Educate them, only like that you will make them your clients. Later they will thank you for that.

Yes AML/KYC are just a disguise to fool people to strip their rights and apply forced taxation.  
This is modern slavery... but Bitcoin is coming to fix that, after centuries of slavery, finally the people can be free.  
**Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters (the masters) and give it to the people (the slaves).**  
Now is time that the people would continue his work: use Bitcoin only dump the fiat. The banksters/gov have power ONLY when you use their worthless goat shit fiat. They can do shit about stopping Bitcoin. Just fearmongering and manipulations. Wake up people, the only way to win this fight is just using Bitcoin. Hodlers, start moving your coins, start using them, start working for bitcoins, start spending only in bitcoins, thei is the true way to be free.  
I think humanity have for the first time in the entire history the opportunity to break free from the slavery. Humanity was slave for centuries in many different ways, organized by banksters, kings, emperors etc. But now is time for us ... the era of dinosaurs is over!

Yes. Blockchains will help a lot to have:  
- direct vote for projects, NOT politicians/fucking parties  
- follow up of gov/administrators expenses (open blockchains will not let them to use the money for a voted project in other scopes or corruption)  
- people WILL PAY for common goods/projects if they will know that those money goes to what they really need. And will pay the fair price  
- Taxation in this environment will not be necessary or as we know it. Today's taxation is a a tribute for the masters not a help to the community.  
Bitcoin and Blockchains will fix this big fucking error we are living today.

I build up a nice Bitcoin community around me. And that was a lot of talks and work, for years.  
I am in Bitcoinlandia from 2012 when hit me like a hammer. From then I always tried to explain it to people that really need it. Never to squareheads that they don't need it.  
That's why I could make a huge decision in 2015: closed all my bank accounts and live only with BTC. My employer starts paying me in BTC, my landlord start accepting my BTC for the rent, the local grocery start accepting my BTC, the bars in my community start accepting my BTC, the gas station accept my BTC... all these will never happen if I wouldn't talk with them, first in particular and later in groups, to listen their problems and find a way of how to solve them.  
We had several group meetings in the corner bar where we talk and talk about Bitcoin and come up with questions and answers on how to use it every day.  
Now we are a happy community that uses Bitcoin daily.  
People should start from low level, local communities and not expecting that the central gov or big companies will make the announcement that from now on we accept Bitcoin. That will never happen.  
Each one of us is a piece of the puzzle, we have to start with us, with our community.

Yes my wife has some, but not all. In Bitcoin is better not to trust... anybody.  
In case I am about to die I will give her the keys to find my wallets. I prepared a nice text with instructions, coded using passphrase.io (with several steps), like a nice treasure hunting. So when I am about to die, will just say 3 words and she knows what to do. If she is not capable to do that, I am sorry for her...  
Don't get me wrong, I have a wonderful wife and we have a nice relation, we are open each other and she knows that I have hidden wallets.  
Believe me when she saw that she can spend easily my BTC was like a vulture, so I said... stop game until here. From now on each one with his wallet.

I can't use anymore Bitwala!  
We have greedy miners that are not allowing me to use my BTC to pay my bills, to buy stuff for living, to receive my salary.  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:55:51

And Coinbase is the tool that banksters create exactly for that.  
- they start advertising all over the places  
- is the first "recommended" exchange by many agents and dumb users, like there is no other hundred ways to buy BTC  
- make all those users to depend of Coinbase and keep them using all the time Coinbase as a exchange and a wallet, to have maximum tracks of their BTC moves and make all the connections  
- start making "problems" to users: blocks, seized accounts, delayed txs, reports to gov etc  
- create anger and rejection from users and those will push this anger and rejection to all Bitcoinlandia, because in many people minds Coinbase is the ONLY one place in contact with Bitcoin  
- And the cherry on top - [IRS is now the "customer service dept" for Coinbase](  
When people warn here about NOT using Coinbase they were shilled with downvotes and even threats, making them to look stupid in the eyes of new comers. This is a well know "procedure" of all these "big companies" that are "promoting" here on reddit. Don't be fooled, question everything (including my opinion) but at least don't jump into something at first sight when you see it here.

For an encrypted flash drive I personally use Electrum. Is light, few megs, and works perfect.  
Exodus I see it hard to carry and use. I would not say that is bad. Only that is not perfect for that.  
For a wallet with exchange integrated I suggest 2:  
- Jaxx, is portable also and have integrated Shapeshift and is multicurrency. I really like it. Also the parity with mobile.  
- Bitsquare.io - you can install it on a Rasp Pi, you have full control of the wallet keys and your data, it is a P2P decentralized exchange and you have support for many currencies. It's like a portable bank/exchange that you have full control and privacy.

Bitcoins are not "stored" on your phone. Bitcoins ALWAYS stays on the blockchain, never leave their nice cozy seat. What you have in your phone wallet are the KEYS to access your bitcoins. Nothing more.  
That seed (12 words passphrase) is the encryption of your wallet file (your bitcoin keys). In case you lost your phone, you can recover it anytime with those 12 words.  
Also I recommend you to use a PIN to your Mycelium wallet.  
Definitely you need to read more about Bitcoin. Before doing more things with your bitcoins I suggest to take your time and read, lots of reads. There is plenty of sources on internet. Start with here, the right panel ------&gt; where it says Security guide for bitcoin

What's the point of running full nodes and get nothing, when we have miners like Antpool that mine empty blocks for years and gets rewards.  
I have resources to run at least 10 full nodes, but the 5 I had running for years, I stopped them (no more 8333 port open).  
When I will see that miners are amended for mining empty blocks or at least they will not get any reward for doing nothing then I will restart my nodes.  
Or at least give to full nodes incentives like for miners to mine empty blocks. All those rewards for empty blocks give them to full nodes aleatory, random choose or by the time the node was online.

Look I am a big supporter of Bitcoin and eradicate (forced) taxation. But, society have to continue and that can be achieved only with community contributions, voluntarily, free-will not forced.  
I am sure in the future we will have this kind of scenario: people will give money (cryptos) to build projects for common good (not wars and BS corruption), but those contributions can be traced by any citizen that contribute. Only then we will have a real government in people's service.

Adoption? I am a real proof of adoption: I live only with BTC from 2015 and I closed all my bank accounts. People that really want to do that, will do it. Widespread adoption start with us, as individuals not with govs and banks and big companies.  
Start using BTC in your local community and then one by one will spread it.

bitwage.com and cashila.com. Also I saw that pey.de is into this.  
I am receiving my salary in BTC from 2015, first through bitwage and cashila, now in 2016 was directly BTC wallet to wallet.  
But if the company doesn't accept yet BTC so doesn't have yet BTC reserves, bitwage and cashil are the best 2 options. No hassle with exchanges, quick, clean, all happy.

No, Bitcoin IS NOT to cheat taxes.. Bitcoin is to eliminate all kind of forcibly taxes...  
For centuries, the elite keep you paying taxes in exchange for some "liberties" but in fact is too keep you busy to pay your taxes... that they used to fund wars, corruption, lies etc

[I member]( back in 2013 telling my friends and family what is Bitcoin and should consider it their future. And their answer: "you are a crazy fuck, blah blah blah".  
In 2014-2015 when they see that I am still into Bitcoin and more and more people get attention to it, I said: ["Nah, is still not for you"](  
Today in 2016, all of them are buying like crazy and ask me more details about Bitcoin every day.  
Patience and education is the key to adoption.
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:45:11
The answer is:  
[I get their monopoly money]( and I bought lots of BTC and if they ask me why I do that [I slap them in their face]( then I travel to another country [without saying a word at the airport]( about my money, [keeping my bitcoins in a cold storage]( so nobody can seize or stole them, so [not even Negan can take my stash](  
Oh I forgot, [in the airport toilet I found a nice toilet paper]( ...  
So this is the story my darling, because you know... [liberty is a rapid growth plant]( and the banksters were busy with their endless printing worthless fiat money, but us, the bitcoiners, we were busy with building a new society, a free society.

They can't ban something that they can't control.  
But they can say "it is prohibited to use", but is just a say, with no value or action. Those words remain words and NOTHING can stop Bitcoin to be used.  
Is like saying "from now on we ban breathing"... Ok so? People will continue breathing.
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:22:03
I still have 1 BTC in a BTC vanity address imported into BCI from 2013. I used BCI from 2012 and I never get robbed, hacked etc. Because I am taking care what am I doing. I take security seriously.  
Maybe there are many that get hacked with BCI, but I consider that 90% laziness and ignorance to details.  
I have exported the keys (from when that was possible), I always tested those keys, I have backups and I test them.
For me BCi wallet is another wallet that is OK and I use it very often. I can't say now how is to buy BTC with it because I don't need to buy BTC anymore, I earn them.

@_date: 2016-11-10 18:04:57
Bitcoin is not a "hobby", Bitcoin is the path to freedom. The price is just an illusion of wealth, a distraction from a much bigger picture.  
If you look at Bitcoin as a item of speculation, you are losing from start.  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Now is time and our duty to continue his vision of how we are going to use/manage his work to be real P2P money.  
The first step, yes, is to buy BTC, but we have to be careful because the banksters are not dumb and they try every day to slow down the adoption of BTC. That's why [they create and funded Coinbase]( to make it the worst place to use BTC and also to impose draconian rules and regulations, to make people to stay away from buying BTC. There will be no Coinbase user that will not be tracked, closed account, seized money, questioned and in the end his name will end up in a gov/banksters database with BTC users.  
We have to NOT give up on our rights and in special the right on financial privacy. Coinbase, behind the rules and regulations that is "supposed" to respect will do much more than those KYC/AML stupid rules, will sell all your info to "others" and will use it aganst you when you never think about it.  
People should start using Bitcoin just as MONEY and dump the fiat. Is a hard and slow process but will be if people will try to take out from their minds the fiat money, that is fake money, lies, corruption, slavery.  
**Fiat = slavery**  
**Bitcoin = FREEDOM**  
Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange, **strongly recommended**  
  
  
 - US &amp; Canada, integrated into Mycelium and Airbitz wallets  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
  
 - trade and exchange with bank accounts, cards  
  
  
  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU  
  
  
  
 - buy with cards in India  
 - nice app to buy in India   
  
  
  
  
  
 - buy in AUS with cash, ATM  
  
  
And the list goes on and on...

True. I could add: every satoshi you spend buying things from merchants that accept BTC directly, you make this world better faster.  
Dump fiat, use Bitcoin. Is the best way you could secure your future.

@_date: 2016-12-30 12:26:56
Jaxx.io, the desktop/mobile pairing is great, with integrated shapeshift. Small, portable too.  
Electrum also is great for desktop/mobile pairing and security.  
I live on BTC for long time and these 2 are my favorites for desktop. I use many types of wallets, each one for a specific reason, feature, use. There is no "best" wallet. Each one is quite unique and serve a purpose.  
[But always keep in mind the golden rule of Bitcoin](

Look, I don't want to open a some kind of pizzagate here. You can do your own research, there is plenty of info out there. I just give you some clues to follow. If I start pouring here the info, many will start saying that is a conspiracy and are "fake news". I know them. I don't care. Each one of us should do own investigation and research. In this way each one will have own opinion, conclusion and when somebody else will say the same like you, you have the confirmation that your research/conclusion was right. Taking all the conclusions/opinions/researches just served is not the correct way and you will end up in manipulations.  
What am I saying are based on my own research. Maybe I am wrong, maybe not, but worth listening and investigate further.  
I hope you understand my position. Reddit is NOT the place where to publish proofs, you will be dismissed, banned, threaten, tracked etc if you do that. But is a place where you can say openly your opinion.

**Bitsquare is to just buy/sell BTC P2P**, people should understand this. Bitsquare is a form of escape from fiat not a form of making money from trading. That's why is having a limitation amount, so scammers and "traders" will be pushed out. This is for REAL bitcoiners not for speculators!

Did you realize that after 8 years we are still only less than 1 million users and we are struggling with mempools and Bitcoin can't get through to be what was designed to be?  
Did you realize that the banksters are doing everything possible that Bitcoin will not get through, including by manipulating the mempools and fee market?  
What makes Bitcoin attractive against fiat and fiat payment channels and where the banksters can "act"?  
- Low fees - they have enough fake money to pay others or both sides (low/high fees) to manipulate and make them fight each others  
- fast - filling huge mempools makes Bitcoin to be slow until is about to be like banks
- fungibility - they can't do anything  
- open source - they can't do anything  
- permissionless - they can pay miners (with fake money) to make a selection of those who are not paying an established fee  
- borderless - not too much they can do  
- faith - yes, they can manipulate lots of minds, with media campaigns, R3, TV, IRS/Coinbase, terrorists, Silk roads etc, just to deceive new comers into believe thet BTC is only for criminals, yes this is working because 6 billions from those 7,5 you are talking are totally brainwashed. The already convinced bitcoiners (the real ones, not the speculators) will never let down Bitcoin.  
So think about, if you were a banksters and hate Bitcoin because is ruining your life, what you will do? We should NOT underestimate banksters...

What happen when a "bitcoin-bank" like web/online wallets will close/seize your wallet account? You are simply in the same situation like today with fiat banks: lose your money.  
Any decent wallet (mobile/desktop/hardware) will offer you the functionality to export/save your private keys to your bitcoins. The wallet app is just an interface that gives you access, trough those private keys, to your bitcoins.  
If you take those private keys/passphrase and import/use in another wallet, you will be able to access your bitcoins anytime.  
This is the golden rule of Bitcoin and every person that use Bitcoin should take seriously in consideration: 
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:56:06

It's your choice to use their services, but we should not accept your choice as advice when we know [what Coinbase do]( and you just ignore.  
Next time try to use ONLY your BTC wallet when you buy something and you will see that is a much better experience.

I suggest to try many wallets, of course those who gives you the option to control your keys 100% and see which one fits better for your habits. There is no "best wallet", just the wallet that is for you. Each of us use wallets for different many things and we have different habits and tastes, but is good that we have a list from where to choose the one we like.

Bitcoin always stays on the blockchain and you can access them only with your wallet keys.  
Those cards are FIAT cards and have nothing to do with Bitcoin network. Are a BIG fucking lie!  
You give away your REAL money (Bitcoin) for fake money (fiat) loaded onto those fucking cards.

Sorry...  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay/any other intermrdiary page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries). There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**

Sometimes yes, but worth every effort when you know that with every day you didn't use fiat you put another nail in banksters coffin.  
I have some "reserves" of BTC from 2012-2013 when I mined a lot with CPU/GPU/USB, that help me not to go crazy.  
I also shapeshift my incomes: BTC-&gt;alts-&gt;BTC (new created addresses, spread the amount). I don't want that my employer or any other fuck, knows where my money goes :)  
If you are well organized and know the market, you can have some small profits from these exchanges BTC-alts-BTC.  
Buying stuff with BTC is every day more easier:   
 - anything you want  
 - Open Bazaar search engine  
 - buy from any online shop with BTC  
 - buy with BTC and get discounts from Amazon  
 - buy with BTC from Ali

I will give a small list of reasons for NOT paying taxes:   
- lost [9 trillions from FED]( (also our taxes)  
- lost another 6.5 trillions in [military funding](  
- lost track of [Irak war billions](  
- lost track another [trillions on 9/11](  
- [all taxes goes to military complex]( - how many roads, hospitals, schools etc can be built with these trillions?    
- pay taxes to [fund these military police that kill civilians instead of protecting them](  
[- pay taxes so the gov can tax me rain water and ponds on my property?](  
- pay taxes to build railroads [that later GM dismantle them to push their agenda of heavy use of cars](  
This list is even larger than you can imagine.  
And people still pay taxes like nothing happen, thinking that is for common good...

Yes, that is the question: what kind of gov will be good?  
I foresee a future of a direct voting with a very limited government. But that gov will have more a role of administrating the common things, not a decision maker gov. We should not vote for a gov, but for common good projects. That gov to be just an administrative role, with good educated people that knows how to manage and administer projects, and those people hired based on their education and experience not voted by the large mass of sheeple.  
What we can have also, some speakers. Those who will promote and explain to large population the projects that need to be done. But also those ones can be elected by direct vote.  
Let's finish with this madness of politicians elected by fraudulent/corrupt/lobbying "democratic" voting. It's useless and not representative. Also why we should put somebody in place **to decide** for me. Let me choose what is good for me, like individual, or not. 99% of cases the elected class is not doing what people want.   
This for example is a good option:

You want to give them a present in BTC ? - use a voucher or a paper wallet/QR code printed on that invoice or separately.  
You want to receive their fiat in BTC and you don't want to convert it into fiat again? No problem, bitwage and cashila do that for you.

They are too dumb for BTC man... I will tell you my story from an airport.  
I was traveling with no cash or other money on me, just for 2 days a small luggage and not even a laptop. Just 3-4 USB sticks (encrypted).  
So at the control the guy asked me, a bit bored for his job: do you have any cash, money to declare, you know now we have some limits... bla bla bla.  
I said: Oh yes I always travel with all my millions (in my head making the conversion of some 70BTC on those USB). Is that a problem to travel with MY money?  
The guy immediately change his face color in red, thinking that he will have a promotion that day. And he said: do you have another bag? I already checked this one and is nothing there.  
I said: yeah but you can't find my money because are invisible and I can recreate them anywhere I want, exactly like the central banks printing their money, I can create also my money.  
He gets nervous in that moment thinking that I am joking but I was very serious and calm. He grab me out of the line for another inspection with another 2 guys.  
After few minutes, finding nothing, they said: are you joking or you want to lose your plane?  
Then I answered: guys you are living in another dimension. Today's money, the real money are in my head, on internet, everywhere, you can't stop me.  
Having nothing against me they release my passport and stuff and let me go. So I go to the entrance gate for the plane.  
But, before passing the gate, one of them, came after me and in low voice asking me: hey can you explain me what is going on? And I said: get out of this job and buy some cryptos (I didn't mention Bitcoin), this is all I can give you. I will not give you the whole information about my money, do your homework or get another job.  
Then I left... with the guy looking at me like a stupid.  
Hope you enjoy the story :)

Best, easy, quick, safe way to accept BTC on your ecommerce site is:  
**WP + Woocommerce + Bitcoinway.com + Electrum wallet**  
No intermediaries, BTC goes straight to your Electrum wallet and if you choose the Pro version you can generate a new address for each sell.

Same. For example in 2015 I used cashila.com to receive payments for my invoices, from fiat transfer into BTC. I gave them the bank account of cashila with my reference (a code), they transfer the fiat to that bank account (SEPA) and I receive them into my cashila account and then withdraw them into my BTC wallet.

It's always the same scenario. Some of you when somebody is warning about the dangers and stuff, you just say it's OK until you get stunned and then you start posting here and crying.   
Wake the fuck up and consider all these warnings very serious. Or just don't come back here and cry. I really don't care if you lose your money because all of these scammers. But when I see lots of people here coming back and crying I am really pissed off because they don't want to listen when their were warned. They are just dumb and do every time the same mistake and go always in deep shit place to scam them.

Just patience, we have greedy miners that are not allowing to use your BTC to pay my bills, to buy stuff for living, to receive my salary. Maybe later a good miner will decide to accept the low/normal fees txs and your tx will get through, that depends on how much greed they have.  
Now the greedy miners are the new banksters and are violating the first rule of Bitcoin, mentioned in [Satoshi papers]( at the beginning: "**A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution**"  
Right now there is an interference like a financial institution that is not allowing me to send my electronic cash to other party: the miners limiting the amount of fee.

Did you watched the video? What do you want more clear than that:  
"If you control the bitcoin keys, it is your bitcoins. If you don't control the keys, is NOT your bitcoins."  
Exactly how is it with money when you put them into a bank account: cease to be in your posession even if it says that is in "your account", but that account the bank have FULL control of it, NOT you.  
There are tons of wallets out there that gives you the option to control 100% your bitcoin keys.

I understand you, ok. What I don't understand is why you continue to say that "bitcoin banks" are trustworthy, when they are not at all. The average Joe is regularly a moron that will never understand the lesson.  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid the vultures and bloodsuckers and offer to the average joe the solution to be his own bank. If Joe don't understand that he deserve to be a moron with his money in the hands of banksters.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank = act accordingly  
Where is fitting the phrase *"banks are trustworthy"* into: if you control your bitcoin keys, it is your bitcoins. If you don't control the keys, is not your bitcoins ? It is NOT. If the average Joe doesn't understand that simple rule, he deserves to be a moron.

Why do you think are more than one Bitcoin payment method? In fact it is ONLY one: wallet to wallet, P2P, decentralized method.  
I think you should read again the [Bitcoin papers]( - Bitcoin can't be banned, stopped, seized, controlled by govs. Bitcoin is MATH, is P2P money, you can't stop people using it. Will be like saying that gov will ban breathing air.  
You should watch [this entire talk]( and maybe you will understand a FACT: Bitcoin can't be stopped and will never be stopped.

Companies and me we always bill in EUR not in BTC. Taxes are in EUR not in BTC.  
Short story: taxes are not complicated. You complicate your life thinking that are complicated or your accountant is stupid. All your accounting is in EUR and nothing to do with BTC. BTC is mentioned only as a form of payment not the currency used for prices.

Your bitcoins are just fine on the blockchain, nobody took them or move them and will never leave blockchain.  
It is your problem for securing and managing the keys to your bitcoins, no matter which wallet you use.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank = **act accordingly**  
So open your eyes and don't drink or play pokemon when you deal with your bitcoins.  
If you transferred bitcoins to a wrong BTC address (not yours) IT IS YOUR FAULT not Copay.  
Backup phrase is when you recover your wallet in a new phone or desktop app. So first you will need to delete or uninstall the app. Once you install it again you will have the option to create new wallet or recover from a backup phrase.  
But first you should check if you sent it to the correct BTC address.

I didn't include bitmarket because I have no personal or friends experience, so would not include if a service is not well known/confirmed or is scam/bad experience from somebody else.  
I suggest also to your client NOT to withdraw fiat from those BTC, but using them directly to buy stuff or pay invoices.  
I live in EU too and I live only with BTC from 2015, I closed all my bank accounts and never touched again the fiat.  
Here is a list of paying bills services with BTC in EU:  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - recharge your phone credit  
  
  
  
 - buy/sell BTC, pay bills  
Then a list of places where to spend directly his BTC:  
 - anything you want  
 - Open Bazaar search engine  
 - buy from any online shop with BTC  
 - buy with BTC and get discounts from Amazon  
 - electronics shop for BTC  
 - groceries  
 - order food for BTC  
 - clothes for BTC  
 - pet food with BTC  
 - wines for BTC  
 - vary stuff for BTC  
 - coffee for BTC  
 - clothes with BTC  
 - cigarretes with BTC  
 - tech with BTC  
 - VoIP calls with BTC  
 - buy VoIP credit with BTC  
  
  
The list can go on and on..  
This is the way we have to continue Satoshi's plan for a P2P currency that is Bitcoin. Using BTC just to avoid some stupid fees is not enough, we have to use it like REAL P2P money and fuck the banksters!

No, everything bad in this society starts with forced taxation. Bitcoin is not here to avoid taxes, is here to avoid robbery from your gov. Bitcoin is here to fix that by creating a new type of economy and society, the society of freedom and voluntary tax.  
**What we have now is a wrong system that needs to go!**  
Of course we need funds for common projects for society but those projects can be financed also in other ways than forced taxation that 99% goes to wrong projects or hands, wars, corruption, terrorism etc.

Don't let them fool you with those cards. Those cards are FIAT cards, so you are going back to the shit.  
If you want to be free, stay on BTC, never go back to fiat.  
I will explain you with an analogy:  
Let's say you have a gold mine but you don't have a mint machine to make the coins from gold. You can go to shops to buy stuff but they don't have a way to measure your gold or split it in parts.  
I have the machine and I will pay to you in fiat paper money for all the gold you mine. Those paper money I print them with my own machine, whenever I want, how much I want, no limit, with almost no cost. And I pay for your gold with those worthless fake money.  
Merchants are accepting those money because the gov said to them to do that.  
So you are giving up your gold to me for worthless shit fiat, instead of making yourself some coins and buy stuff directly with your gold.  
The same way or worst is functioning those plastic cards - A BIG FUCKING LIE!  
Banksters are doing EVERYTHING possible to keep people to use their worthless hit fiat, including this way to fool you with those cards.  
Use only BTC and convince also merchants to accept BTC, this is the way we should follow if we really believe in Bitcoin and want to get out to freedom.  
FIAT = slavery  
Bitcoin = FREEDOM

Before you will start screaming that if you don't pay taxes they will gonna put you in jail, I will remember you something else:  and consider that using only BTC is your protest for need to change the law!

Start with this:  then continue with all those videos from the list.  
Then if you really want to put your money at work, take a look into  - real Bitcoin projects/companies that need investment, to make Bitcoin greater than it it.  
The real investment in Bitcoin is TO USE IT AS MONEY not as "an investment". I hope you will read more and learn WHAT REALLY IS BITCOIN.

If you look into my history posting here, I think I posted few times my "guide". Actually all my posts are full of clues how to do it (if you look closer).  
I can't give exactly, step by step guide, because not every place on this planet is the same, with same people or rules. Each one of you have to find his way to do it.  
What I can say is that I live in EU, in a small community, open minded people. We start low, we go forward. Many people think that Bitcoin should start at high level (companies) to reach the low level (people). They are WRONG! The way we should do it is slowly at local level, low level, educate people, friends, family, neighbors until many will demand to merchants, companies, local govs to use Bitcoin.  
It's not easy, is quite hard to do it, but what will make people to do this step is **determination** to end this fucking nightmare created and maintained by the banksters!

Yes, sometimes can affect me but hey, I started in 2012 with faucets, mining, buying all the way until 2014. Those early days was quite good time for mining, so I get almost free BTC. 2013-2014 I bought like crazy at any price, so my stash grow visibly. That's why now I don't feel so much the "pain of volatility".   
Also today's "volatility of -+10$/day? This is nothing. My first buy was at $27 so until $780 is a long way in the rollercoaster. It's fun.  
I have enough BTC to live free, without any bank and fiat. And even if BTC will be again $20 I really don't care.

This is actually the "model" of all those on Localbitcoins, they speculate, buying from cheap exchanges and sell there for more.  
Also you pay that "premium" because you are not verified when you buy BTC. Always the anonymity have a price.

Just fear mongering. Spain IS NOT BANNING CASH, just limiting to 2500€ per transaction in cash from 3000€.   
Anyway, Spain is not so "wake up" in terms of Bitcoin and you will not see now anyone there hoarding BTC just because TDV warn them. They are still "busy" with their internal political game that goes nowhere.  
Spain is the last country in BTC adoption and/or knowledge about BTC, in EU. And this is because Spain is limited in education of his population about BTC. Kept in dark and vote :)  
Many of Spaniards don't (want/know) speak English so real news about BTC will not reach them, also the few news in Spanish about BTC are insignificant and don't penetrate too much into population.   
Just look into coinmap.org and see, there are just very very few merchants comparing with other EU countries. And Coinmap is just the surface of Bitcoinlandia.

SR was perfect operation of a 3 letters agency. From the beginning until the end. They plan it in that way so they could use Ross as a patsy, to be the frontman of the entire thing. Then they frame him and put in jail for life so he can't speak the truth out.  
They use SR as an example, to hit hard into Bitcoin, so people see it as a "bad thing". Their plan worked in some way, but still many people do not fall into the narrative.  
Agencies do this quite often, create a honeypot trap, fools get into and then they just collect user data.  
Ross will never be free again, because he will tell the truth, loud and clear. They will keep him for life in prison (the best scenario or just kill him in jail). The truth about SR is really uncomfortable if is revealed. There are many implications.

Yes, when will happen, in US will be in short time and people will not have time to adapt. There will be chaos. I see US people like in a lethargy state, brainwashed by all those plastic cards and depending on them. People should wake the fuck up and prepare for the worst, start using BTC regularly, even if it is few times, but at least they know to adapt quickly when SHTF.  
Here in EU we have a bit another mentality and people start waking up more often. 2017-2018 there will be huge change and people will not know what to do.

[I member]( that I made my first 1 BTC in 2012 playing a faucet :), those times it was really crazy with those faucets throwing away huge amounts of BTC. When I saw that I thought that you should be crazy not to take them. Then I start mining with CPU/GPU, then in 2013 when was the first wave in price (March or something like that) I start buying from localbitcoins.  
When was the 2nd big wave in price (1200) I didn't buy, that was too expensive for me that time. But I continued mining and get some good rewards. I still have those mined BTC. I never sell.

Always split your hodlings into 3 parts, but never in a custodial:  
1. Hardware/steganography/steel wallets: Big amount, funds that you barely need to access, you are only depositing  
2. Desktop wallets: medium amount, buffer zone from HODL to quick spend (Electrum, Core)  
3. Mobile/Lightning wallets: small amounts enough for quick spend  
Always keep in mind: control your keys, never use custodial, no matter how much "convenient" or "insurance" they promise you. Bitcoin is not fiat, Bitcoin is property and you should act accordingly.

Working for bitcoins today is not so difficult. You have 2 options:  
- employer pays you through bitwage.com or cashila.com, in fiat and you receive BTC to your wallet  
- employer pays you in BTC directly, wallet to wallet  
Rent? I convinced my landlord more than a year ago to accept my BTC. Now he's very happy.   
Restaurants? Today more and more are accepting BTC.  
Check directory apps or convince a local bar restaurant to take your BTC. I did that too and now I pay for my beers in BTC at a local bar:  
  
  
  
Groceries? I convinced a local shop on my street to take my BTC. The owner, a pakistani, is more than happy with that, sharing his BTC wallet with his family in Pakistan. Just last week I talked with him and he was giving me a lot of discounts and free products, just because I told him about Bitcoin more than a year ago. Not just that now his family is living OK with BTC, but he saves a lot from sending money to them and also he doubled his money just for exchanging his earnings here in BTC. Now my landlord is buying with BTC in his grocery, also another employee of my landlord (cleaning guy that he pays in BTC from my rent).  
In this way we start a small local Bitcoin community here.  
Lots of places online to make your regular shopping.  
 - anything you want  
 - Open Bazaar search engine  
 - buy from any online shop with BTC  
 - buy with BTC and get discounts from Amazon  
 - buy with BTC from Ali  
Paying bills? No problem at all!

Right, so from the beginning you just violate the definition of Bitcoin.  
[Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**   
Seems that you need to learn more about Bitcoin.  
The best way to do your website would be:  
1. using [BTCPay server]( - all in one solution  
2. Using [C-LN Charge plugin]( + [NoMiddleMan plugin]( (if you want also onchain payments)  
3. Using [LND Woocommerce plugin]( + [NoMiddleMan plugin]( (if you want also onchain payments)  
Easy ways to have your own BTC+LN node:  
1.   
2.   
3.   
4.   
5. .... many more or build your own node box

Depends how you used that wallet.  
In the blockchain the transaction show the location of the node that process your tx, not your originating IP. Even then if somebody want to track your address, have to contact that node and ask for a detailed log (if they keep it and if they want to give it). Even then the IP from where you did the tx can be hard to trace and if you use a vpn or tor, that will be quite impossible.

Bitcoin is already changing the world as we know it.  
And yes, govs will have less and less influence/decision. I hope this will not go to fascism but to a real P2P society.  
Bitcoin was designed to run a P2P society/economy, but now is our duty to continue this work and build the society and economy around Bitcoin. Satoshi just gave us the great instrument, now is time to think how we are going to use it.  
Going back to fiat is NOT an option!  
And "Bitcoin --&gt; idiocracy" - I don't think so. Will be much Bitcoin --&gt; better world, peace ... [and justice for all](   
Right now Fiat --&gt; Idiocracy - the system of endless debt goes to idiocracy.  
In a "Bitcoin ruled system" people will get used NOT to spend more than what they DON'T have. Yes will be lending but people will not make endless loans and pass the debt over and over for years and generations. And this will be the biggest change and challenge that Bitcoin will do in our society: changing mentalities.  
And we will have some chaos soon, people are not used to change their mentality over the night, this will take time, years. Also banksters will fight to keep the actual mentality of sheeple. I hope in the end more and more people will wake up and change the actual mentality, so the chaos will slow down.

Use bitsquare.io - a P2P decentralized exchange and nobody will have to "verify" you or delay your transactions. You are always in control of your money.   
From now on, that will happen with all "centralized" and "regulated" exchanges, they are pushed by govs to track/register BTC users with their real names and maybe they are building a big fucking database user of Bitcoin. Better stay away from these.  
Also you can buy BTC from a B-ATM, localbitcoins.com, or in person using Mycelium wallet local trader option.  
For US/Canada also is available the buy option on Airbitz wallet using Glidera exchange, but not sure if they ask or not for ID...

Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank = act accordingly  
Use a mobile wallet for change, not much than spending for few things  
Use a desktop wallet at home in your safe computer and keep medium amounts for more online spending  
Use a hardware wallet for larger, savings, long time keeping, for larger amounts, that you don't need to move them all the time, just for depositing. You can move time to time to a desktop wallet for convenience but medium amounts.  
Always keep a copy in a password manager app (not in cloud) all the info about your backups for wallets: passkeys, qr codes, private keys etc. Keep that password manager safe and encrypted, not on your regular pc, put it on a usb.

- bitcoin (with b small cap) when you refer to currency, money, amount  
- Blockchain, not block chain, also better specify The Blockchain, when you refer to Bitcoin Blockchain. There are many other blockchains out there but they have nothing to do with The Bitcoin Blockchain.

- These cracks are when the BTC price goes up fast.  
- The dips are when the banksters are trying to patch the cracks with some cement (aka flooding the market with new created fake fiat money). So the water it stop, for a while, until in another part of the dam, new cracks appear.

I did the way around: insisting to be paid in BTC. After a year of discussions, talks, debates, my employer finally started to pay me through cashila.com, as a first step, then after few months when he started to buy for the company some BTC, paid me directly to my BTC wallet.  
Today, after more than a year, there are more employees that are paid in BTC. Because the wheel start rolling over and the employer is convinced now that Bitcoin is the future.  
Asking around cashiers will not do too much. Make the owner of that shop to pay that cashier in BTC and then you get much larger adoption/use of BTC.  
I convinced my landlord to accept the rent in BTC and after few months now he pays some of his employees for cleaning in BTC...  
Start local, between local people, with small exchanges, buy/sells  using BTC. Educate your neighbors, friends, family, when somebody try to pay you in fiat, do not accept it and instead say that you accept BTC with a discount.  
Or sell something and if they want to pay in fiat/CC/bank say that they have to pay an extra "banksters tax" or pay with BTC at a normal price.  
This makes more people start asking more about Bitcoin and then you come and explain.

This will happen with all these "bitcoin banks". Why people will never learn the lesson? Once you use an user/password, there is nor more YOUR money, is THEIR money and they will do whatever they want with those money. YOU are the product, you are giving them all the information.  
Stop fucking using these fucking "bitcoin banks" for fuck sake!  
This is not the only one and the last one. Same happened with Circle, with Conbase, with Bitpay, with Wirex, with Uphold, WB21 and so on and on... and will happen with many more from now. And that is only because of you. If you do not use them they will die!  
WTF is so hard to understand: buy your BTC from an ATM, decentralized exchange, voucher or just earn it, put it on your own BTC wallet that you control it 100% and use it from there or HODL it if you like.  
Using a centralized, "regulated", bitcoin bank, controlled exchange, you will don only harm to yourself. This is what banksters/gov want: **to control you!**  
Forget "trading" shit and so, that's just market/media hype. Get your BTC and stay out of that shit. Be happy.

I never use a "mixer service" because from the beginning is a scam.  
But I use shapeshift.io to "*shapeshift*" my BTC.  
I have a stable monthly income in BTC so I need to lose track of those coins.  
Simple process: I receive the payment in 1 address, that address I split it in 4-5 pieces sending to shapeshift 4-5 txs to exchange them into some altcoins (the one that gives you also some small profit).  
Next day (never in the same day) from those 4-5 altcoins addresses exchange them back to other new created BTC addresses with a large portion of time between transactions.  
I usually even have 4 different wallets, depending on which I need BTC (mobile, desktop, hardware, HODL).  
In this way I never lose any coin and always have spread coins and lose track. Nobody can trace back to my real identity the original coins.  
If you want to make some more profit from this shapeshifting, you can use bitsquare.io.  
Other shapeshifting webs:

- be able to restore a segwit passphrase with derivation 49, as in the desktop version

3. Send to yourself or even to other wallets you have, in 2-3-4 different txs/addresses.  
or  
Instead of Wasabi, you can use Bisq also to exchange your BTC into Monero or other altcoin and then back to BTC to new created addresses.

**Education is the key!**  
You better give them as a gift a book about Bitcoin. Andreas or Saifadean's books are really good gifts. And you could just add to that gift a Trezor or Ledger or any HW wallet, empty. Let them discover the beauty of Bitcoin through education.

Is not wasting time for Conbase/aka banksters/gov tool. Conbase is used to track/monitor BTC users.  
Conbase was created/funded by the banksters EXACTLY with this purpose: register/monitor/track every user and keep/share that record for later use.  
If you really want to buy directly into YOUR wallet then you should use a P2P decentralized exchange or use a shapeshifting technique for your BTC until you get into your OWN BTC wallet.

BTCPay, BTCPay BTCPay - is the only way right now.  
As a long time BTC user I will always reject any BTC payment that is done through a 3rd party intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
@_date: 2016-09-17 12:21:10
You can't "lose" your bitcoins with Mycelium. Is just that is not good to carry with you large amount of bitcoins.  
A scenario can be this: a crook will push you on a side walk and force you with a gun to say the password/pin of your wallet. If you have all your stash there you lose everything. If you have a¡only change, you will not risk your life for some satoshis. No worth it.   
Instead, you can keep on a HW wallet the majority of your stash, hidden, backed up etc and when you need more in your mobile wallets you just have to move some change from your HW to mobile.  
It's exactly like in fiat world, did you carry with you all your savings in your leather wallet? No, you just keep some small bills.

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](

[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Nope. You can send normally from a non-segwit to a segwit and vice-versa.

Bitcoin usability do not stand in not having aliases. 2 BTC users really doesn't fucking care about what type of address they exchange in the tx if that exchange is easy to do.  
Doesn't matter if it is 3xjhs694... or JohnAlias, the exchange is done in the same way.  
Many will prefer to stay behind many random BTC addresses than aliases that can be traced later.

And weren't? I think you really underestimate the banksters "weapons" and tactics against Bitcoin.  
[Here is a warning for you, maybe you didn't paid attention at the time, but is always available](  


Oh so now you reveal your true "identity"... nice try.  


They will never be because they will never implement segwit. LN without segwit is NOT working.  
Their catch up phrase with segwit2x it was just a distraction from their true desired fork: censored blockchain.

If I would buy BTC I would prefer to pay a higher fee than being registered/monitored/scammed/robbed/seized.

What you do with you channel it is your own business. But you can't force other players to do that.  
What you propose is like let's make a protocol that will not allow users to buy drugs with BTC. We will go back to square 0 with that. We use BTC to give freedom to the people to do whatever they want.

Works just fine too. Sentinel and MoonPOS apps are "read only" wallets. That means they do not have any control over spending your BTC. Just receive.  


In MoonPOS app you just have to type the amount in USD and will show to the client a QR code to scan that already contain the conversion. Your employee doesn't have to do any math or bother about how much have to charge in BTC.  
I think there are more read only wallet apps out there. test some and use the ones you like.

Where I live BTC is used every fucking day as money. With no need of legislation or politicians to push it.  
Bitcoin DOESN'T NEED any legislation to be used. You just use it.  
A politician that is "pro-bitcoin" will never do anything for Bitcoin because he knows that is nothing to do for Bitcoin.

You know who is because the person that gave you that address showed you a QR code to scan it, lazy idiot.
Bitcoin was designed exactly for that, to avoid to reveal a true identity of a user. if that disappear, then Bitcoin is useless.  
Stop crying about you can't use it in a friendly way. Start learning and then teach others.  
How many people are sending an email today and really know where is located that domain server and who controls it, what software is using etc? Maybe 0,001% of the entire planet population can tell you that. The rest just doesn't care, because they don't have to.  
My mom (70yrs) is using BTC as it is for years and she never complained like a child like you that is hard to use it.  
Freedom come with a sacrifice. Our generation is the generation of sacrifice. Teach your kids about Bitcoin and they will be better users and developers of the Bitcoin's future.  
**STOP FUCKING CRYING AND USE IT AS IT IS!**  
When I see people posting complaints about inability to see WHO the fuck is the owner of a BTC address I consider it as a bankster agent or a fucking moron. Bitcoin it is like it is just to HIDE that true identity of a BTC address user. **LIVE WITH THAT SUCKERS, OR DIE!**

2016-2017 was spammed like hell by all Bitcoin enemies. There were 90% of txs with only small amounts and big fees. Plus the Antpool mining empty blocks like hell.

If is only a webshop, just implement [BTCPay solution](  
If is only a shop:  
1. Use this tool **offline**, on a clean computer   
2. Generate a wallet seed BIP39 with derivation path 49 (for segwit). Done, you have your first "segwit paper wallet".  
3. Write down/save in an encrypted file all the information needed.  
4a. Download/Install Samourai wallet (mobile) and use the generated seed to open that wallet. Done, now you have a segwit wallet on your mobile, same as the paper wallet.  
4b. Download/Install Electrum desktop wallet in your computer.  
5. Use the same seed to open your wallet into Electrum. Use the option for BIP39 and derivation path 49 **(this is very important)**. Done, now you have your segwit wallet on paper, mobile, desktop. Accessible anytime.  
6. Download/install Sentinel **read only** wallet (mobile) and import xpub from your wallet seed (see point 1, when you save all the wallet details). Use that read only wallet in your shop, only to receive payments.
Optional, if you are more concerned and want to have more privacy in your txs, use Samourai wallet (also Electrum wallet) to connect to your own node. Install Bitcoin Core wallet/node/client on a computer, be sure you have downloaded and updated the blockchain database and then connect your Samourai wallet to your own node. All your wallet txs will go only through  your own node.
Optional: you can download/install Bitcoin Lightning wallet (mobile) and open a channel for lightning payments. Due to your low price items, it will be much better.

Tell him my life story.  
In 2012 I bought BTC  just with beer money.  
I never stopped buying with all my beer money (I stopped drinking too much beer and lose weight too).  
Then I start buying with 10-20-30% of all my income.  
I mined BTC, I earned BTC, but I NEVER sell. I use BTC to pay for what I need, directly. But never goes back to fiat.  
In 2014-2015 I get a bank loan and bought BTC too. Paid back in 1 year. All BTC never sold.  
Today I have enough BTC for me and my daughter's future to live in peace and free from banksters slavery.  
Freedom is priceless. Bitcoin is the fight against banksters, is the fight for your freedom.  
Don't sell your future for today's past.

1. The sheep represent the sheeple that never buy BTC. They're just sheeple hanging out there.  
2. The car driver is a "day trader" that buys ATH and panic sell at bottom. That's why he jumped with the car on the stairs (aka red candles)...  
3. The midget is a noob. He didn't eat 1 year to buy BTC (actually 0.01BTC) at ATH, then he put himself into that shit thing to hold on tight and not be able to go to his PC and sell all his BTC (0.01BTC). For him this is HODLing :) Now he's trapped into that shit thing (I don't know the name) because he forgot to read more about BTC and now is too late. He's the perfect example of all those noobs coming here for "making money" but they totally ignore to read before they use.

But if you **never** link a BTC address with your name, you have nothing to worry, they will read just a bunch of numbers and letters, moving around, that will say nothing about you, the X man.  
If we will let the gov&amp;banksters to fool the people and let them to "control" the blockchain, then yes we should be very very very concerned about it.

"*Does moving my coins after buying them help with security and privacy?*"  
Yes, is a must if you care about your financial privacy.  
Anytime you buy from an exchange that was asking you to prove your identity, you should shapeshift those coins.  
Shapeshift = exchange them into altcoins and then back to BTC but to new created addresses, spreading also the amounts (if you buy large amounts).  
If you buy from a P2P exchange, in person, cash, ATM, there is not really necessary to shapeshift them.  
You really care about your privacy, use bitsquare.io a full P2P decentralized exchange. I know is not so convenient like Airbitz/Glidera but sometimes we have to put in balance privacy with convenience. Depends what you choose.  
You can try also Mycelium wallet local trade.  
Question: Are you from US/Canada? Because Glidera works only for those countries.
@_date: 2016-09-20 18:38:00
Man, take it easy. We are all watching torrents and mainly because we DON'T want to see the annoying/intrusive ads when those movies are broadcast.  
But there are so many content creators out there that the actual music/movies/content industry is sucking them from all their right for earnings from THEIR content.  
Now, Popchest and Watchmybit (and many others) come up with a system that we all can afford and content creators can earn directly from the consumers.  
Don't worry, for sure will be a lot of trash content, but that will be eliminated by good content, community comments, system of votes, free time of watching previews so you will not have to waste your money for content that YOU don't want to pay.  
If you live in a place where is quite difficult to see new movies/series, right now you have to download the torrents but if you will have the option to pay DIRECTLY to the creator for watching live/offline his latest movie/song/serie etc of course you will pay for that through a platfom like Popchest, watchmybit, streamium, bittunes and many others.  
The content creators will fight for their prices and offer good quality of content, otherwise they will get pushed out, but they know that they are paid DIRECTLY by consumers.  
Right now the media industry is pushing/promoting **only what they want you to see, not what you would like to see**. THEY are making the selection for you, when should be the way around.

Did you ever bother to read just the statement of this sub that is on the right panel?  
"Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.
If you are new to Bitcoin, check out We Use Coins and Bitcoin.org. You can also explore the Bitcoin Wiki"

I am paying almost every day for my groceries with BTC. I never waited more than few seconds until the tx appear on the merchant's wallet. It's less than the time of paying with a credit card (swipe, PIN, call, confirmation, print receipt etc). NONE of the merchants told me to wait for 6 confirmations until I could get my products. And will never make a double spend for my groceries. I would prefer to avoid paying taxes than rob a merchant that accept my BTC! Robbing merchants is really lame and you are robbing yourself.

Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

You can have many wallets as you like. For coffee, for paying bills, for small savings, for big savings. For each of these you can have a dedicated wallet and type of wallet: mobile, desktop, hardware, paper, brain, picture embedded etc.  
Fuck the taxes, nobody will know where you save your money if you care how you use your bitcoins. If you never link your identity with your bitcoins, nobody can find out how much or where you have your stash.

BS graph. Why? All those examples are meaningless.  
If you really want to show who, what, how buy with BTC, use the most common categories of goods bought with BTC:  food, sex, drugs, electronics, drinks, services.  
You put in this example EXACTLY the most NOT common products that are bought with BTC.  
Who the fuck is going to space travel every month or year even?! And pay with BTC. That's insane.  
How many people are buying with BTC Tesla cars?  
Who so insane to buy $200 glasses with BTC? What those that cost 20-50 bucks are not doing the same purpose?  
We are not talking about the "exclusive" insanity of buying an iphone or macbook for that insane amount of money when a regular phone or laptop can do the same purpose...  
OK I have to admit that with the Coke you nail it.

bitsquare.io  - P2P decentralized exchange, you are always in control of your money.  
Or start being paid in BTC. If your employer still doesn't have BTC to pay you directly in BTC, use bitwage.com or cashila.com to receive your wage and convert it into BTC with no hassle.  
We all have to remember 2 golden rules of Bitcoin:  
- Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank = act accordingly  
- You control your keys, you own the bitcoins. You don't control your keys, you don't own the bitcoins.  
Bitcoin is ownership, a hard property, not like fiat that is an IOU worthless note, a promise that you will get back the value of that note. Stop treating your bitcoins like fiat. "Keeping" them in a bank, exchange you also give your ownership to those bitcoins. Are not YOUR bitcoins anymore! And what you receive for leaving them into a bank, exchange, custodial account: an IOU, a promise that you will get them back. Means a big fucking lie!
@_date: 2016-09-17 13:35:41
$10-$50 you say is fluctuation? That is nothing for long term. I don't care about BTC price. Most of my BTC stash that I still HODL is from 2011-2012 when I was mining. Now what I earn I spend them in few days (buying all I need until the next payment and pay all the bills) and remain with some for HODLing. So no time to wait for a fluctuation.  
Soon all this madness with BTC exchanges will end because fiat will be obsolete or only gov and police will use it... so who gives a shit about fiat?

Let them try. Maybe they can kill BTC. But they ignore a very important fact: people can't **unlearn** about Bitcoin, once they know it. They can't take out the idea of decentralized P2P money, that is the seed and will bring back over and over more and more P2P money.  
Satoshi opened the Pandora's Box of knowledge and from now on more and more other solutions will rise. They will kill one, in the next second 5-10 more will rise.  
Banksters have no chance to fight and win this battle!  
During 10 years we saw many articles like this and even worse, talking about "killing Bitcoin". And we will see many more from now on ([as Andreas warn us many times]( From now on the game will be really interesting, banksters entering in the last phase: desperation.

Maybe, but they will never respect the golden rule of Bitcoin:   
And those that offer also the keys, will discover that only a very tiny amount of people will "trust" them. There is no point in sharing your BTC wallet with a bank if you have control of the keys. Only if you want them to "watch" all your transactions and "share" this information with your gov...  
So let them try, will be hilarious to see how they will fail. They will became obsolete like faxes, only police stations will use their services...

Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](

[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

Bitcoin doesn't need any reconnaissance or approval. Gov approval or outlaw is absolutely zero regarding Bitcoin.  
What govs can do (and they are doing quite well) is manipulating sheeple's mind and slowing down the acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin. But on the other side this "slowing down" is also good for Bitcoin. Will have more time to perfect, to create more good apps, wallets, use cases.

There is no such thing of spamming transactions. If the tx pays the correct fee is 100% legit and acceptable.
@_date: 2016-09-19 15:19:17
Shapeshifting is not a term against Coinbase, is about not being tracked 100%.  
Bitcoin is anonymous **if you never link your identity with a BTC address**. That doesn't imply automatically that you will use BTC for illegal stuff. No, is about your financial privacy.  
Example:  
You receive a BTC payment (salary/exchange) that is pegged to your real name. If the seller/giver have all your data, you never trust it that will not release/give that data to another "party". Or just that the giver/seller can trace all your uses of that BTC address.  
So using a "shapeshifting" can lose track of those BTC you received. You can exchange them, using many small amounts to exchange it into other altcoins, then back to BTC but to new created addresses. Never same amount, spread it into pieces. I know that sounds a lot of trouble but worth it if you care about your financial privacy. Later nobody knows what govs will do with all those databases of BTC known users.  
If you are well organized you can even use this shapeshifting into trading altcoins with a small profit.  
I am paid in BTC monthly for more than a year, now. And I shapeshift my incomes all the time. I don't want that my employer track my spends. He knows that I shapeshift his payments, I already explained him and understands it. But also my BTC address remains in his records so I don't want that the gov check that too. Now they will see just an endless lost track of those coins and they will have ZERO prove that the spends are linked to my name.  
EDIT:  
Instant exchanges/shapeshifting

Anything about Bitcoin. And most important is that Bitcoin is not a game, is very serious issue for all humanity. To hava e better comparison, is like how the caveman discover to make&amp;control the fire, now the evolved caveman discovered how to create&amp;control the money, from the people, to the people, for the people.  
At 16 years I think is a great timing for you, to start learning about Bitcoin. This will be your future.

- and watch &amp; learn from these videos:   
Then come back with more interesting questions about Bitcoin.

That's because many people don't make difference between The Bitcoin Blockchain and other BS blockchains. The media brainwashed them so hard that actually works. This is the banksters goal to move your attention from real Bitcoin stuff meanwhile bombarding media with BS articles &amp; info about worthless "blockchains".

Continuing to use fiat, you support directly the lies of your gov and banksters, that fund wars and corruption!

I wonder why many people are watching others addresses, how much they have, how much they use, transact, but they NEVER care about THEIR own addresses, to have BTC in them, to use them.  
So you found an address with lots of txs, SO WHAT?!  
Take care of YOUR addresses not others. Be sure you have so many transactions and BTC in it.
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:17:28
Nope. Bitcoin doesn't fit into  that. Bitcoin will change totally the way we are doing and thinking about money, loans, savings etc.  
In a fiat world, continuous/endless inflation, people are used/pushed to take loans and be in debt forever.  
In a Bitcoin world, continuous deflation, people will start saving/hoarding, for later use, they will be their own borrowers, they loan from themselves in the future when is necessary.  
I don't say that will not be institutions/people that will borrow BTC to others but will be limited (not like today craziness). Think that people can't spend more than they have (like today), so borrowing BTC that they don't have will be quite impossible, or at least they will have to fool again idiots to believe in fractional reserve shit.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:18:25
Or you can just use Electrum wallet and open the tab coins or addresses. It's the same.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:20:32


Because later the banks get bailout by us... they never pay the loss or go to jail. Or just print more money.  
If you lose your fiat wallet with a bunch of fiat bills, why don't you just print more bills for yourself? It would be the same as the bank "returning" your money.

Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin. And will never forget.

@_date: 2018-11-16 15:43:38


That is not supposed to be a BTC acceptance.  
Bitcoin was created exactly to avoid any intermediary.  
If you really want to accept BTC, do it by wallet to wallet and keep them or pay your employees with BTC.  
But converting them instantly into shit fiat is the dumbest move ever.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:06:22
Customers that want to use BTC to pay are using it exactly because they want to use a P2P currency not a P2B2P. We already have that and is named VISA/MC.  
Paying with BTC is not just another "payment option" is a breakthrough boundaries of financial freedom. A merchant that is selling immediately those BTC for fiat is just enslaving himself back into fiat system.

If you wouldn't be so concentrated to the buying price, it's already what was designed to be. So stop speculating and be more concentrated in use it as money.

OK I can agree with a cost of installation, training personnel etc. If I would a noob merchant I would pay for that.  
But I will never accept that all my BTC txs would be monitored by a 3rd party app/provider.  
Make an open source app, so everybody can see it and charge for services.  
But telling me to "register" with all my details in order to be able to use your closed source app, and giving me that app "for free"... that is a huge alarm signal that something is behind.

I know my opinion will be downvoted to hell by gov agents. But I have to repeat it here so people start asking questions and not taking the gov's version as they presented.  
Silk Road was an operation created from the beginning by gov agencies, with the goal of crashing Bitcoin image and people that are using it.  
They (gov agencies) were the first DPR, then they bring in other "admins" and Ross, deceiving them into their "project", but in fact they controlled everything from behind.  
In the end they used Ross as a patsy to take all the load and be an example for all the rest and for the world, using his case to show to the world that Bitcoin is bad and all those using it they will end up like him.  
Luckily the world wasn't so dumb to believe that shit plan, but unfortunately Ross became a martyr.

That's a total nonsense. There will be no such thing. A country that impose a "legal tender" means force his citizens to USE that currency that they will control it.  
Bitcoin doesn't need ANY gov to declare it "legal tender". Bitcoin IS a perfect tender for all those people (no matter from which country are) that embrace the freedom.  
People that are waking up will slowly stop using fiat money as a forced "legal tender" and start using BTC as freedom tender.

I do the same. If I see a merchant redirecting my BTC payment to a 3rd party intermediaryy as Bitpay, I cancel the payment and NEVER use that merchant again.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:

I'm not pretending anything. Should I? Nobody closed any account, I just don't use it like the main one. Somethi9ng wrong with that?  
In the past few years I used many nicks, what is wrong with "parking" old accounts? If I don't use them in the same time to manipulate votes or comments, there is nothing wrong with that. Show me where is mentioned that is forbidden to have different nicks for each subreddit that you use in a separate way.  
Tell me the nick I had back in 2011, 2013, 2014 because I was here all the time. But you don't remember/know because I changed all the time the nicks. Why? Because I like that.  
Check this one for example and tell me that is not the same "person":  
u/ Posternut - posting only on Bitcoin  
u/ Harpua1983- posting only on BTC  
So? Nothing wrong.

When you see a company that announce "their blockchain" but not using Bitcoin or any other open decentralized blockchain, that is a signal the company just want more media attention and more money. That's it, is nothing about innovation.  
Also it is a sign that they are losing terrain in front of all those companies that are really adopting Bitcoin and open blockchains.  
Mark my words: in few years Amazon will implode itself. Why? Because once the Bitcoin + LN apps will settle a base foundation, there will popup so many **decentralized little Amazons**, using BTC + LN, that Amazon itself cannot handle.

Best way to buy BTC is to use a P2P exchange like bitsquare.io  
But also you can use bitwage.com or cashila.com to receive your salary (or part of) monthly into BTC. Payer pays like usual in fiat and you receive BTC. No limits, no closing account, no asking for what you need BTC. Don't forget to move your BTC into your wallet and "shapeshift" them.

Why always have to be a reason? Is just Bitcoin, if you still don't get it, maybe is not for you.  
Bitcoin is still in the early phase, only people with lot of nerve can handle this rollercoaster and this is because they will never look at Bitcoin as a "get rich quick" scheme.  
Banksters, in order to "introduce" their shity "stablecoins" will have to disrupt the Bitcoin price market... so all come together now?

You still don't get what really is Bitcoin... Bitcoin doesn't need any support from any mediator. If you pay the correct fee, your tx is on the blockchain where it can be checked by **the both sides**.  
If the merchant doesn't have the correct system in place **is the responsible for that delay**.   
That's why Bitcoin is not going forward: because of elements like you, squareheads.

I don't care if they follow or not the law.  
I care about people that are going blind and use their "services" without knowing the real "goals" of this banksters tool that is Coinbase.  
A service that is regulated/respected by fincen rules doesn't mean is the only one that you should use it or is the best one. But contrary, should raise more questions when is about using Bitcoin.  
The question that matter: which is the goal of your gov? To leave to live free, respecting your rights and privacy, including the financial privacy or trying to know all about you using all the "tools", including Coinbase services?  
Andreas have a great question:   
Coinbase wasn't created to help people to get Bitcoin, **it was created by the banksters to track ALL the people that want some bitcoins**.  
If you really want that your future financial privacy to be respected, never use a "regulated" exchange, but a P2P decentralized exchange, that doesn't keep any trace of your buy/sell, btc addresses. You can say today that "you have nothing to hide, you are not using Bitcoin for drugs" but tomorrow you will regret it...

Bitcoin doesn't need any of those fancy shit design paper from an antiquated banking system. Copying the old system doesn't make Bitcoin better.  
Bitcoin with just few lines of code is enough to be something very special and disruptive. Doesn't need any fancy "independence paper". We, as BTC users, we sign every day **transactions** and with that, every tx is a signature for our independence from the actual banking system.  
Every BTC tx is a drop of blood from the banksters body and that is all that matter, until they are dry out of blood.

yes. Also using many different types of wallets.  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets. There is no "best wallet". There are only wallets that respect that rule or not, with some more or less features for users commodity.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

That is just another trick to make you pay your taxes (aka being a modern slave). This is even more evil way, is trying to make you feel good that you pay your taxes with BTC.  
Cheering up that Ohio state offer you to pay your taxes with BTC is not good, but a sign of concern: they want your money!
Here is an interesting story to reflect about:  
In one of his meetings, Stalin (Soviet dictator, 1878-1953) requested that a hen be brought to him. He grabbed her strong with one hand and with the other began to pluck her.
The hen, desperate for pain, tried to escape, but could not.
So he managed to remove all the feathers. Stalin told his assistants and secretaries: "Now watch what is going to happen"
He put the hen on the ground, moved away from her a little and grabbed a handful of wheat in his hand while his collaborators watched in amazement as the hen, scared, sore and bleeding, ran after the tyrant dictator while he was throwing fists wheat and was spinning around the room.
The hen chased him everywhere. Then, Stalin looked at his assistants and secretaries who were totally surprised, and told them:
"It's that easy to govern the stupid, do you see how the chicken chases me in spite of the pain I've caused?" So are most of the people, they still vote for their rulers and politicians despite the pain they cause them simple fact of receiving a cheap gift, a stupid promise or some food for a day or two.

Will not be easier to just log your keys/actions and send the passwords, address to everything you have? That will have a much higher rate to obtain something with the same effort for putting the stupid malware on your pc.  
Remember one thing: all scams are based on stupidity of victims and PROBABILITY to have much higher rate of infection.

Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:

No it won't cut the middle men.  
Banks offering savings accounts in bitcoin - NO fucking way! That will violate [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
Retailers using a bank with bitcoin - what a fucking nonsense is that. Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid that shit. Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

If we want that our society to evolve to something that humanity didn't have it for thousands of years, we have to make Bitcoin to work and continue the Satoshi's work. Only like that humanity can evolve in something greater and NOT going to a new "Idiocracy" ruled by fiat and banksters.

Banksters are printing more fake money and they pump it into the BTC market. It's simple: when there is more offer to sell and more fiat money to buy, the price goes down.

You don't have to apologies, this is a great idea.  
I did something like that but without any software.  
I took a picture with a camera of a nice panorama, where I put some objects and clues, in a specific order that I only know. All those objects and clues are the 12 words of a wallet passphrase that I keep it for my daughter and I continue to deposit to it when I have some spare coins.  
The picture is posted online or I keep it on USB together with other nice pics, or on a website with other pictures, in plain sight, but nobody will notice that the picture is containing a wallet with quite nice prize!  
[Something like Andreas A. posted here](  
My daughter already knows how to open a wallet from those 12 words but she still don't know that I create one with a picture. When the time will come I will tell her which picture is and the clues. She already saw the picture but nobody notice anything :)  
Advice: Don't put a picture like that on your wall in a frame! That will be too obvious. Mix it with other like any usual picture with you and family or pets.

bitcoinway.com the best WP plugin for accepting BTC. Linked directly to your Electrum wallet, free/Pro version. Easy to use.  
Downsize/scams/robbery can occur when you use another intermediary that is the custodial for your BTC until you move them to your wallet. That's why I use &amp; like bitcoinway, is a direct tx between the customer and your wallet.  
The only thing is that you will use always same BTC address, but that can be solved later with shapeshifting process, if you like.

OK at least show me in a short video your Conbase wallet , displaying a bc1 address **as a sender**.  
Or displaying a receiving address bc1, where did you send a tx (doesn't matter from what address) and can be verifiable on the blockchain.  
Conbase, as far I have info (because I don't use  that shit), is using a specific algorithm that **can allow their users to send** to bc1 but not receiving to bc1. This is not segwit implementation, is just fooling around. Maybe they use an intermediary wallet before you receive into your wallet, but you will never know that, because nothing is transparent with Conbase...

Move the BTC into your personal wallet, then exchange them into altcoins using shapeshift.io and back in BTC to your personal wallet but this time into new created BTC addresses (better wait some hours or 1 day).

You forget to add who really is Bitpay:  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:  
You should add another column that say it clearly: this company/provider is **watching** all your txs and index them into a giant database. That apply for almost 99% of all those "payment processors"...

Yes, I could say that Electrum respect 100% [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
But, as a personal experience for about 6 years using BTC, my advice is to NOT depend on only one wallet app. You could easily use your seed/passphrase on many wallet apps as you wish. We are at the beginning of a long road and apps come and go.  
Securing your bitcoins it's YOUR own duty.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[Conbase closed Gab account](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly 
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

But you still asking for a fiat card?! wtf?  
STOP name it "bitcoin debit card". There is no such a thing. All those shit cards are VISA/Mastercard, full of shit fiat NOT BTC.  
Using these cards we are just going back to fiat, that we tried to avoid in the first place using BTC. These cards are just another banksters tool to fool you people, to use again their shit goat fiat money, to keep you in their slavery.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary ([as these shit cards]( between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.

A HW wallet is to keep safe a large amount of BTC not to carry with you around to pay a burger. I could just have a simple mobile wallet with some change for that. I would never cry for losing a phone with 0.1BTC on it, just because it would be encrypted and with wallet backups offline and/or other devices/apps/wallets.

I think is advancing too fast, but not came to early. It came exactly in the time was needed. Who sees the necessity of Bitcoin will take advantage and learn, buy, use it. Thing is that there are so many innovations in this space that a normal noob not-so-techy person can't keep up with all so could be a feeling of overwhelming and "too complicated for me".  
I have friends that are even pay me in BTC, just to give them a resume of all important info that matter for them each week/month.

Few years ago, when I start being paid only in BTC for my work I decided to start a meetup in my area, talking about BTC and helping others to understand why is necessary. I invited, neighbors, friends, local merchants.  
By just talking and hearing each other's problems and how we can find solutions using BTC, we reached now a good level of BTC acceptance in the area.  
Using BTC is just normal now, not seeing are freaks &amp; nerds money. Is seen as the future of money.

There are also read only wallet apps for ios. Search for them.  
A read only wallet means that you do not put your private keys into that app, just the public ones. Follow the wallet instructions and you will see that is simple.  
Once you receive the BTC, it will show up on both wallet apps, the employee one (read only) and yours. From there you could move it anywhere you want.  
 is for both android and ios.

If you DON'T CARE about your financial privacy you can use Coinbase or any other exchange that is asking you to full identity and shit. Tip: use you grandma ID :)

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly 
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

You should use   BTC ATMs,  even  is much metter than all those shit ways you already tried.  
You have to keep in mind one thing: the time for waiting to receive your BTC in your wallet is directly proportional with the centralization of the exchange you use.  
Now, also the price you will pay is direct proportional with the decentralization level of the exchange you use. More decentralized = bigger price, because you know... in a decentralized world nobody gives a fuck about your identity.

I was hoping not to see Coinbase as the first "recommended" place to buy BTC. So you ruined all with that. Recommending newbies to go to Coinbase is like pushing them into a pit of crocodiles...  
I don't have to say (again) why not to use/recommend Coinbase, there is a long history of their bad actions here on reddit.  
Here are some other places that you should include in your list:  
You missed also to say that Mycelium and AirBitz wallets have integrated exchange by Glidera (for US&amp; Canada)  
** - P2P decentralized exchange**  
 - P2P exchange  
 - pay easy with debit/credit cards and many other methods  
 - buy BTC or exchange BTC for cash to any ATM in EU  
  
 - nice mobile app to buy/sell BTC with cards  
  
 - buy BTC with no account required, with cash to ATMs in EU  
  
  
  
 - buy with cards in India  
 - nice app to buy in India  
 - buy with cards in India
  
  
  
  
And the list goes on and on...

 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills

Good choice! A hardware wallet is a hardware wallet. But each model/brand have his own features/specifications/use. You have to find the one that fits better for your habits or needs.  
This one for example works great with Mycelium mobile wallet, when is about to spend. Just plug it and link and then spend.

I did my part for global adoption and I suggest to all to do as much as they can:  
1. start a meetup in my local area, with friends, neighbors, local merchants  
2. we discuss in a friendly manner and total noob level about Bitcoin, money, economy, how we end up in this (fractional reserve and shit)  
3. weekly meetups with solutions for each case of participants that want to use BTC. Each case in some way is different, because people are different.  
4. help those merchants with easy/good solutions to accept BTC. Help them/assist them in the first days in the payment process, so they will learn better and fast. Support is very important.  
5. start demanding to be paid in BTC or use Bitwage.com to receive your salary in BTC  
6. Use as much as you can BTC to pay for all your shopping, no matter the price it is, you are not in this for get quick rich, you are here for [exiting from Banking Cartel slavery](  
7. Final point: close your bank accounts and use only BTC (I did that in 2015)

I live on BTC for more than a year. I am paid in BTC, I spend in BTC, I HODL some BTC. I closed my bank account in Mar 2015 and from then I never touch any fiat anymore.  
I am done with fiat! FUCK THE BANKSTERS!  
I started too with bitwage and cashila in 2015, but after a while, the employer get convinced about Bitcoin and started to pay my salary directly to my BTC wallet.  
I still use cashila.com to pay my bills, I pay my rent directly in BTC to my landlord, but the rest of my shopping is in BTC directly. I'm also not using any plastic card even if is loaded/funded using BTC. I consider all of those a direct violation of my financial privacy. All plastic cards have a flaw/feature that is not respecting my financial privacy: are using fiat. Fiat is pegged to a bank account, that is pegged to my name and is tracked by the gov. My money IS My money. With fiat you can say that, with Bitcoin yes.

Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Conbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

I live only using BTC for many years, don't tell me that shops do not accept BTC. I pay all my expenses in only BTC. But yeah lazy people prefer to use fiat cards instead of Bitcoin.  
The fight against banksters tyranny start with changing our bad habits (aka using fiat). Stop using fiat as money and the banksters lose their power to put you in debt slavery.  
Satoshi took that power of creating/controlling money from the banksters and give it to the people. Yet there are people now that are easily giving up that power back to banksters (aka using the so called "bitcoin debit cards"). THIS IS THE BIGGEST STUPIDITY.

Paying with BTC is exactly as paying with fiat cash. There is no way to trace back to each individual and even then is a total nonsense to tax using cash.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:18:46
Sure. In short version, I don't want to reveal where actually I live, but somewhere in EU, small community.  
Back in 2015 I start being paid only in BTC for my work. It was a bit hard to convince but in the end everybody is happy now.  
At the beginning the salary was paid through cashila.com. Easy peasy, the employer pays in EUR through a SEPA transfer with my reference, to cashila bank account. Nothing in my name. Once I received the EUR in my cashila account I withdraw/exchange them directly to my BTC wallet, let's say Mycelium.  
That Mycelium wallet also is linked to my cashila account and I can pay bills directly from my BTC wallet. I receive BTC, I pay in BTC, never I am in contact with EUR or they pass through a bank account in my name.  
Being paid in BTC the disadvantage is that is 1 payment to 1 address, big amount. So I have to "shapeshift" that income. I use shapeshift.io once I receive the payment. Spreading the big amount in many small amounts in 4-5 different addresses, passing through an altcoin. So BTC to altcoin, wait 1-2 days, then exchange them back to BTC in new created many addresses. Lost track of my original "income". These addresses are also spread into many categories (bills, change in mobile wallets, HODL in dedicated HW wallets).  
Starting with Mar 2015 I was paying my rent to my landlord in BTC, directly to his wallet. Later I convinced the grocery store owner to accept BTC, then a bar and so on. Many people/stores in my community accept/use BTC now. We decide not to make this public, you know, stupid media etc. We live in peace and want to be like that.  
Once I started to find a way to pay bills with my BTC, then I realized that I don't need anymore the bank account. So I close them. I don't have debts so FUCK THEM! I still have to finish a payment for my car but that I find a another way to pay with BTC. I use a friend. He pays my monthly bills and I give him BTC in exchange. Person to person. He is happy too that don't have to use his bank account to buy BTC.  
The grocery owner is a pakistani that also share his shop wallet with his family that is in Pakistan. He is more than happy now. Me and my landlord we are his best client in BTC.  
The gas station in town didn't wait too long to accept my BTC. In the beginning was a personal treaty between me and the cashier, now the owner is more than happy to accept directly BTC.  
The landlord also have more apartments that he rent them and also employees that some are taking BTC.  
Slowly the wheel of Bitcoin start rolling over.  
My biggest problem was to convince my employer to pay me in BTC. That cost me almost a year.  
Do not think that there are no places to spend your bitcoins out there. Is a matter of patience and dedication to find them. I buy also a lot online and spendabit.co is one of my favorite. Now I start also on OpenBazaar but still are few that deliver in my area.  
I declare my incomes based on my service invoices and for that I am paying taxes in EUR, that still paid with BTC through cashila!  
I have to mention:  
- I started in 2011-2012 to mine and those BTC I still have them, on HODL, for my daughter's future.  
- 2013-2015 I bought BTC every time I had spare cash, no matter the price was, no matter the amount of cash I had.  
Bitcoin now for me is:  
- Money  
- Freedom  
- a form of my contribution to human history in changing this world in a better place. Eliminating the fiat is the best thing that can happen to this world for the last thousands of years.  
- a form of protest against banksters, FUCK THE BANKSTERS!  
Let's not forget one important thing:

Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    


No, THEY are creating more volatility by forcing the merchants to dump immediately their BTC instead of using them to pay their employees and suppliers in BTC. Merchants should understand that we will not get rid of these bloodsuckers if they continue to dump BTC for fiat. We need to close the circle and slowly and steady, stop using the damn shit fiat!

If you want that your account to be suspended, tracked, seized, watched for what you use it, your details to be on a gov list of bitcoin user (for later use), yes use Coinbase or Circle. Both are banksters companies, created just to track bitcoin users, not to help them.  
There are tons of exchanges out there and yet, their paid agents are "recommending" all the time when somebody new is coming here.

You can do it even easier if you use bitsquare.io and if you want to have all transactions in one interface.  
Bitsquare is giving you a full personal wallet that you are in control.  
All happen in bitsquare app.  
Buy BTC with fiat. Then those BTC shapeshift them into altcoins and back to BTC in the same bitsquare exchange, using different BTC addresses, spreading the original amount.  
The 12 words passphrase from your bitsquare wallet you can use it also with MultibitHD to restore your wallet and manage it from there (payments, funding etc). So if you are using that wallet for buy and stuff, not exchanges, you can use it from MultibitHD.  
Me personally I prefer to use shapeshift.io and spreading the original amounts into 4-5 different BTC addresses and type of wallets too. Let's say I receive initially 3 BTC, I shapeshift them into 3 different types of wallets with 5-6 BTC addresses. I usually have wallets on mobile, desktop, hardware. Mobile for change, small amounts, desktop for medium amounts, hardware for large amounts, HODLing.  
Every time I receive BTC linked to my real name/identity I shapeshift them. If the income transaction doesn't have any of my info, I just move the coins to another BTC address/wallet.  
I use dedicated BTC addresses for income with name and income without name, I have even 2-3 vanity address containing my name or part of my identity in it. But those are used in a different way.  
Never spend directly from an income address.  
Bitcoin = Be Your Own Bank = **act accordingly**

Seems that the banksters/gov really want to destabilize Bitcoin community and lower the price. The question is why? Why they are so afraid of Bitcoin?  
They always said is a ponzi, fake, worthless etc so they could just leave us alone, (in their opinion) we will die anyway, so why bother so much? Including the fact that they are using our money from taxes against us by paying those trolls.  
[Normal people should ask THIS question](  
If you have some time (is quite long but worth every minute), [here is a video lecture of something amazing: the explanation of how taxes are formed and who really benefit of them]( A lecture that you will never see in schools (also this aspect is covered in the lecture). Amazing stuff!

Finally some real good news for adoption. Good work!
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:39:14
OK, I will tell you what I did for many friends/merchants near me. The system works flawlessly for them. I don't know if this is the best solution for you, but could be a start.  
1. Save this page offline   
2. Generate your own segwit wallet keys/seed using derivation path BIP49 if you like  
3. **Save all that information ON PAPER and keep that paper in a safe place!** - see [Bitcoin resources]( for how to secure your seed.  
4. You can use that wallet seed in many different wallet apps: Electrum, Samourai, etc.(see again Bitcoin resources for more wallet apps). Electrum for example is good for you, when is time to manage your in/outs addresses, coin control, financial management etc  
5. You could use Sentinel read only wallet or Moon POS, installed on a tablet or simple mobile, for your employees. They just have to show to the client the QR code, with the amount of BTC that have to pay. They will not have control in any way to SPEND from that wallet app. ONLY you on the other side with Electrum (fdesktop) or Samourai (mobile) can watch and spend those BTC.  
6. You do not have to change your actual POS system, use the read only wallet app just as you use a credit card machine. That's it. If you really want to integrate BTC into your POS system, then you should look for Odoo systems and many other more. I don't have the links at hand right now, but there are more.
EDIT: I found one  that have integrated BTC payment. Or this one   
Point 1 could be also a hardware wallet. But I suggest to use first a software wallet for all income and from there move your savings into a HW wallet. It will be easier and clearer for you.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Look, in 2012 I start buying BTC with beer money (20-50-100€/week), because BTC was cheap back then. 1BTC/week with beer money, yes wasn't a critical loss. Actually they were already a loss if I would bought some beers. They became piss in few hours.  
But, buying those BTC every fucking week, I never thought that it will be just for fun. From the beginning I had the certainty that I do that for my future and for my daughter's future. I consider it more like this: 1BTC is a lottery ticket that will take place in near future (5-10-15 years) and that ticket is the winner.  
Meanwhile, just deep deeper into the rabbit hole and learn more about Bitcoin. You will be amazed what will reserve for your future.  
The speculation price part is just dust in the eyes of sheeple.  
BTW, I NEVER sell for fiat any BTC. I use them as money and HODL for later.

We know about Coinbase and we are warning all the time about that here, but still people ignore the warnings... their loss. Every user of Coinbase sooner or later they will break their neck, is just a matter of time.  
If you look into the history of this sub you will see that is like a cry wall of all those Coinbase users that get slammed by their practices.  
People, please, don't come here to cry, just stop using Coinbase, that is the best thing you can do if you care about your financial privacy.  
There are so many ways to get bitcoins in a safe decent manner, that is not necessary all this hassle and crying.

Merchants should start USING those BTC to pay employees and suppliers. Otherwise, it's useless to accept BTC.  
After years of trying to convince a client of mine to pay me in BTC, finally he accept to buy some and keep them as store of value and pay me. Now he pays some of his employees in BTC only and will extend that to more next year, when his BTC reserve will grow.  


So why bother to accept BTC then? Stick with the fucking fiat.  
Let's be clear and many here will scream that are "traders", but Bitcoin is just a P2P money. That's it. Not a "get rich" scheme, not "investment".

WRONG. Bitcoinway.com is way older than any plugin on the market and is a direct payment solution without any intermediary. Later come up BTCPay.  
If you really want to accept BTC for his real power, do your research, ask and do it in the right way. Not just jump on the first BS link that you see on banners advertising.

People should stop paying with BTC if the payment is redirected to an intermediary like Bitpay/Conbase.  
Bitcoin was designed EXACTLY to avoid any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**   
Merchants! Be aware, configure your BTC payment platform accordingly, NOT through any intermediary. We do not want to go back to VISA/paypal style platforms.  
If I see merchant that redirect my payment to Bitpay/Conbase I will cancel the payment. Better just pay in cash with fiat than using BTC through an intermediary.

Did you watched also this one?  About the FUQ - Frecquently Unanswered Questions by Australian government. A guys goes way far into these rabbit hole. Quite interesting.  
Bitcoin I think come into this, by helping you to have a different "identity" by using BTC payments.  
Let's take Andreas example with the self-driving taxi. Is a perfect example of real identity using Bitcoin. What if starting from this example, a person can setup an autonomous corporate name that act in his name and interests, using exclusively Bitcoin?  
The point from both videos is that right now every person in this world is used like a tax paying machine. Once you get a name you are actually a direct slave.  
What if never will be registered in that name that you get, any business, work, job, income that can be taxed? What if you can create a parallel identity of you that will never pay taxes (aka being a slave)?  
And maybe Bitcoin can have an important role in this.

I have a friend working in a small grocery store (that accept BTC) that is doing a "reverse" job: he's asking customers if they are willing to pay with BTC. If their answer is that "I don't have BTC" he replies like "you should have BTC, is still not too late". Some are interested into knowing more about BTC some are just smiling but the word is out there and that is damn helping spreading the "vibe".

Shopify... that means you are forced to use Bitpay, Conbase or other 3rd party intermediary, accepted by Shopify.  
If I see a merchant that redirect my BTC payment to a Conbase/Bitpay page, I will cancel immediately the payment and NEVER use that merchant again, until they fix the problem (get rid of intermediaries).There are already many solution to implement in a webshop, to accept BTC without any intermediary.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Because average person is not looking to be a real free person but is following an "induced" desire for being rich or get rich quick. I, personally, didn't look to be rich, by using BTC, even if I am an early adopter. I look to BTC to be the total freedom that a humanity need it so badly today. With real freedom, then the wealth come later.  
Realistic is to be able to change your "forced" mentality and yes, average person, today, is not capable to that. Being free starts by changing mentality and start thinking freely from induced daily manipulations of the actual system that want/need you to be just another piece of the slavery not a free mind.  
When average people will be able to change the mentality/vision, will be able to see what is on the other side of the door that banksters are keeping closed and do whatever it takes to stay shut.

If I would have to buy large amounts of BTC I would find a way to contact some miners directly and buy from them. There are plenty of escrow services out there to be sure I would not get robbed/scammed.  
But for buying some change or periodically small/medium amount I would use always a decentralized P2P exchange. Or even bitwage.com or cashila.com (with later a shapeshifting coins).  
I don't trust any other centralized exchange. I am sure that 99% of them are manipulating the volume/price just to attract more "players" inside.  
A decentralized P2P exchange not only will provide security for your identity but also certainty about the real volume/price traded there.

First of all there is no such thing of "bitcoin debit cards". Those card are just another fiat cards. Those cards are NOT operating transactions in BTC, but in fiat.  
People are fooled again, by banksters to use the fiat and this time, selling their BTC for worthless goat shit fiat, that banksters are printing whenever they want.  
Some of the cards are making the exchange BTC/fiat in the moment of the payment with the card, some are needed to be "loaded" with fiat before, so will be a another step of selling the BTC for fiat and then loaded to the card. But in both ways is "rich man trick" to fool the user to give up his BTC for the goat shit.  
**This is another way to keep in line people to use the fucking fiat and NOT the BTC directly P2P like was designed!**  
Wake up people don't let them fool you again! They do this because they need more time to prepare their "fedcoin" to fool you again and again...

A year ago I had a 80% paid in fiat/intermediaries and 20% in BTC directly. Today I have 40% intermediaries and 60% directly in BTC (wallet to wallet) That says a lot where is going.  
Next year my goal is to have 90-10% and then 100% only BTC, but that don't depend only on me.  
I really don't care what is doing with his BTC I paid to somebody. Is not my fucking business.

If this theory was true, in these 8 years, why we don't have any "revealing" operation of somebody that was "de-anonymized" because he used same address? If this theory is true (until now wasn't demonstrated) the whole Bitcoin can go away, will be useless... But still Bitcoin continue to work fine.  
If you are stupid enough to let addresses to be linked to you then yes, you are in danger and put other in danger.  
But if I really want to make public one of my vanity address it is my risk and my responsibility to make those received coins to lose tracks. That doesn't mean the world is gonna end.

Better start from low level: local shops, vars, groceries, small services. In parallel demand to be paid in BTC.  
BigCommerce is not so attracted to introduce BTC payments because they don''t care so much, only when they will see that there are a lot of BTC on the market to be spend.   
I live on BTC and I started from low level... I pay groceries, rent, gas, beers in BTC directly. And I am paid in BTC.

I live entirely on BTC for more than a year. Closed all my bank accounts. No need of them anymore.  
Yes I am lucky and this is not easy, today.  
I am paid in BTC, I pay rent, I pay groceries, I pay gas, I pay beers in a bar all in my local community. I see every day more people interested in using BTC.  
I have also a Xapo card but I use it only few times for parkings. I don't like to go back to fiat linked to my name, in any form. Paying bills with cashila and bitwala is great, I even paid shopping with them (ask the seller to give me the bank details to make the transfer using cashila).
The sad thing is that more of them are thinking more about to get rich quickly with BTC and are not looking to the other advantages of using it.  
Also we have wonderful ways to buy directly with BTC online:

Damn it! Better use a P2P decentralized exchange as   
The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of stakes.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly (don't watch too much porn with the same pc you are dealing with btc, or don't play those stupid mobile games on the same mobile you have a btc wallet)  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

Did you tried on  to check the external IP and port to see if is working?  
Also check if that computer where you installed the node is not blocking the port 8333 in his internal firewall.  
Maybe is not the ISP that is blocking the port but the PC's firewall.  
Is not recommended to leave the entire PC's IP in DMZ if you don't have a firewall activated.  
Also you can check if your ISP is really blocking your ports here  and is not your internal firewall. Use the ShieldsUp tool check.

All my incomes are in BTC. So I use shapeshift.io or bitsquare.io to shapeshift my BTC.  
BTC -&gt; altcoins -&gt; BTC new addresses
@_date: 2016-10-16 18:09:50
They are doing this from the beginning at large scale. Is the¡r only way to slow down the BTC adoption.
@_date: 2016-10-29 21:37:59
Not sure if my real way to "lose track" of my btc can give you the answer you are looking for, but here is my way.  
I live on BTC, so I have every month an income in BTC. I don't want that the payer knows all my transactions, starting from that tx.  
So I take the full amount I received let's say 4 BTC from the single address and I split it into 4 txs into a "shapeshifting" using bitsquare.io and/or shapeshift.io, or jaxx wallet with shapeshift option (I don't like/trust too much those other mixing services for my personal reasons).  
So now I have 4 BTC split into 1+1+1+1 altcoins, then I shift them back into BTC in other new 4-10 new created BTC addresses, even different wallets.  
Yes, this method need to be organized and meticulous, sometimes you can lose some parts due to fees, exchanges etc but also if you calculate the timing of your move you can earn some more due to those "plays" with altcoins.  
Let's be fair: altcoins are a good "thing" to trade/speculate and make some money. Otherwise are not good for anything else...

Yes, it can be a luxury if you just wait and wait for your gov to say "from now on you have to live on BTC"...   
I was taking my "luxury" right back to be my own bank and nothing can stop me to do that.

a good wallet is the one that suit and serve your needs the best. Also to filter them use only those that gives you full control of your private keys. Starting from this point you have many options of wallets: mobile, desktop, hardware.  
Just to name some: Mycelium, Airbitz, Schildbach, Jaxx, BCI, Samurai, Electrum, Multibit, Trezor, Ledger, Case, KeepKey and so on the list is every day longer. None of them are bad, but also none of them are the best compared one to another. It's up to each user to decide.  
A good review of hardware wallets here   
Here are some other places where you can start buying BTC with no fear/frustration:  
 - P2P decentralized exchange, **strongly recommended**

1. Download and setup for you (the owner/manager) the Samourai wallet. Save the passphrase.  
2. Download and setup for your employees, on a separate mobile/tablet the Sentinel watch only wallet, using the XPUB from your Samourai wallet. You will have a wallet that ONLY receives BTC, no way to spend from.  
3. Optional for more control and convenience you can use the same passphrase into Electrum to import your wallet. More addresses control, coin control, desktop version.  
Bitcoin doesn't need any intermediary in order to be used/accept BTC in a local store. You keep your actual system, generate the same tickets, only that you take payments using BTC. When your employees request the payment, input the amount in fiat and the wallet automatically generates the QR code for the client, at the actual exchange rate.  
From your side/wallet, you can manage and watch all the payments received, move the money where you want, shapeshift them if you like more privacy, pay the employees.

I don't pay too much attention to fees (still), I always use minimum and sometimes I recover them from the exchange, I wait 1-2 days to see if I can sell the altcoins for a margin profit to cover the fees. But If I am in a hurry I don't pay attention. Normally I wait at least 12-24h to change back to BTC the altcoins.  
Yes, if I use bitsquare.io I am looking first if there are offers available for that altcoin. No preference for any altcoin, just the one that is on the move. I am not interested in keeping altcoins for more than few days.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:18:17
The question you should ask yourself is: **why the fuck you should pay a tax for owning your money (Bitcoin)**?

Both are useless and you should not use any of them.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Yes. This is not moving your txs or funds to another wallet, is just exporting the keys to access the same wallet, but from Electrum.  
Core/QT BTC client is a full node client, use it only if you really need it in that way. Electrum is an SPV wallet, that doesn't download all the blockchain and easy way to use your BTC.

Just another way to go back to fiat payments...  
Why we see all the time promoting VISA on r/bitcoin?!!!  
When we will see promoting machines, ways, pos, payments ONLY with Bitcoin or other cryptos?!  
When people will wake up and realize that selling your BTC to fund these fiat cards **IS NOT THE WAY SHOULD BE**? This is just another banksters trick to keep you in line using their fucking worthless fiat. Banksters are still alive because YOU are still using their money. Fiat is not and never will be YOUR money (like Bitcoin), is THEIR money that force you to use it.  
When you will understand this, then you really understand why Bitcoin exist...

Nice try IRS...  
*Would you sell or stop using your bitcoins if they were to be regulated?* - Bitcoin will never be "regulated", it's decentralized. You have to make Bitcoin centralized in order to be able to regulate it. If you can do that NOBODY will use it anymore.  
After this question nothing have sense. total crap intent to obtain more info for your lovely gov/banksters.

Conbase is almost the same thing as Bitpay.  
What people do not want to understand and ignore is the 1st phrase of [Satoshi's papers]( that state clearly: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
Using Bitpay, Conbase or any intermediary to process your BTC payment, through THEIR systems, is a direct violation of what Bitcoin stands for.  
People using intermediaries for their money, will regret it badly later.

Why should be "regularized" something that can't be controlled by central governments? It's a nonsense and hard to put in practice. Yes maybe they can "regulate" the friction points (exchanges) but not Bitcoin itself...  
I think you are missing the whole point of Bitcoin: it is free to use, nobody can stop you to use it, nobody can seize it from you (without your consent), is borderless, permissionless, open source, decentralized, limited supply.  
A great quote about this:

You are wrong, banksters was the first ones to realize the potential of Bitcoin to disrupt their system based on lies. Even before many people start to understand that and use BTC.

@_date: 2016-10-15 18:16:29
Why are you so surprised that somebody can live only with BTC. Is a matter of changing mentality first, then the rest come smooth.  
If you have the desire to NOT use anymore fiat and only BTC, you can do it also.  
No matter what job you have, demand to be paid in BTC. Yes can be easier if you are a freelancer, you can move freely in these waters.  
You can start in first stage to demand to be paid in an account of services like cashila.com or bitwage.com (there are many others out there). So the payer can pay in fiat, like normal until now, but in a bank account of cashila or bitwage that is linked to your user name (you get a referral code each time you demand money). Once you have the money in your user account, you can receive them in BTC in your personal wallet.  
Next step is to really "push" your employer to pay you in BTC. You wage continue to be expressed in fiat but the payment is done in BTC at actual rate. This is the best way to be paid in BTC, no intermediary, nobody can stop your money.  
Your employer is not necessary to mine BTC, is enough that his company is accepting BTC or buy BTC on the market. My employer, once he start paying me directly in BTC, start thinking how to get some BTC so the company starts accepting BTC. So you see? The wheel start rolling ove, because YOU was the one that push it in the right direction to roll...  
Yes I pay rent in BTC directly to the landlord. Just went to him, explain what is about BTC and next month he said OK pay me in BTC the rent. That's it. Ok now if you have a moron landlord, this will not gonna work :) All depend on you.  
For your information: I don't live in USnazi.... I live somewhere in EU.  
Remember: the "living on BTC" all depends on your mind and desire to do that. Nothing can stop you to do that.  
Spending the rest? No problem, many places now to spend my monthly expenses:  
 - get salary, payments    
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - buy BTC, receive wages, pay bills  
 - pay bills in US  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
 - pay bills  
  
 - pay bills, receive wages, recharge phones credit  
 - recharge your phone credit  
  
  
  
 - buy/sell BTC, pay bills  
Instant exchanges/shapeshifting  
  
  
  
**Buying stuff:**  
  
  
  
And many other places where, if they really don't want BTC, I request to pay by bank transfer and I use cashila with Mycelium wallet plugin. Takes 20-30 seconds and the payment is done directly from my BTC wallet.

I am buying my groceries too with BTC for many years. But just in the last months the merchant start a LN wallet. But I would not use LN if the amount of shopping cart is more than 50€. It doesn't make sense for me and for the merchant.  
I use mostly LN for buying small things less than 10-20€.  
As I said, if you are concerned about your privacy on the onchain txs, use Wasabi wallet.  
I am paid in BTC from 2015 and I always "cleaned" my BTC income so the payers will never trace my expenses with the original amount. But this year I start using Wasabi wallet that is great for that. Send the income to Wasabi, then split it into 4-5 txs in new created addresses and from there spending as usual. There is no way for somebody to trace back to me any other expenses.

For many reasons:  
- not well informed about Bitcoin and ways to use it  
- greed to take as much as they can more customers, no matter how, so they go for intermediaries that integrate a variety of payment processors and they just have one goal: convert them into fiat  
- **they don't care about Bitcoin** and its future

BTCPay! Or any other solution that will be, not using any type of intermediary.  
I can host my own BTCPay server on a simple machine with backups on cloud.  
Soon we will have many other options. But I will never use an intermediary for my BTC payments. NEVER.  
BTW, I am working in IT and part of my job is to implement BTC payment solution for merchants. I never use any intermediary for that.  
This is the wrong mentality of many people that want to implement BTC as a payment: they always look to the existing systems with fiat and try to adapt them to BTC. It will never work well or have really bad security and privacy issues. People should look forward and adapt their activities to Bitcoin environment and going forward applying more and more privacy and security layers.  
I see what you are doing like this: we tried hard to have encryption keys, PGP etc, but we give to our lovely gov a master key to decrypt them all. Fuck no, why we encrypt them in the first place... ?

Those cards are more or less like credit/debit cards, aka shit cards. You are paying in advance the issuer.  
Wake up guys, BTC brings you full control of your own money, don't be fooled by some shit discounts. The big guys are just taking your money in advance and they really don't care if you will use or not that card, because for them it's already a sale once you bought that card.  
I wonder if Target will be happy like you if they have to give you the products in advance until you will pay them with a .... card. Think a bit like that, **who is** the product in this case?

1. Merchants could easily start paying their expenses in BTC. They can start with employees. But they don't do that because **they don't care about Bitcoin going forward.** And this is a big problem because most of them see Bitcoin as a new fucking Paypal. Bitcoin wasn't created to be a new Paypal.  
2. Accounting still can be done in regular fiat denomination. If every receipt will just have a note like "paid in BTC", but the value stays in fiat. The holdings of BTC could be registered separately if they are appreciated or deprecated in value in time. And that is another history.

I don't see the utility of sending from multiple channels.  
I open channels foe each spending type I want. Use them, then fill them back when is needed. I can open channels with every merchant I do usually txs or if I want more privacy, just create my own channels.  
Using LN for other usage that BTC chain already is doing great, doesn't make sense.

Nope. By simple fact that all txs are monitored by their system. Chainanalisys companies and gov will be more than happy that AtomicPay and other intermediaries will do the job for them. They will just come and grab that database of all txs monitored, link with the users IDs, match it with their own data gathered from other sources and ... viola, they have a very simple way to trace every BTC user that was enough stupid to give away his data to 3rd parties.

@_date: 2018-12-21 13:10:15
No man. It quite simple.  
In order to be able to **receive** you need to spend some. Think about like a jar full with water. That is your new channel. You put funds in there, spend them, that's why you create the channel first, to be able to  pay with LN. Once you make some space, you will be able to receive, but in the channel limit (the amount you send when you open it).  
If you do not have where to spend those BTC, simple using ZigZag exchange, make a tx to one of your normal BTC addresses in a wallet. So practically you send your BTc from your LN channel into your BTC wallet, emptying your channel, ready to receive funds.  
Consider your LN wallet a separate limited pocket. You take from your chest money a bunch of satoshis, put them into youir LN pocket, to spend on the street. You can fill more satoshis in that pocket because literally do not fit. so you can take some coins and put them back into your chest but by using an intermediary. Then boom your pocket is empty.

Stability is when Bitcoin will replace all fiat currencies and all those altcoins will became based on a Bitcoin Standard.  
Do you know how many years passed until USD became the world currency? For sure you don't.

Thing is that I had to receive some funds more than my channel could get (I didn't spend too much from that channel). So it was at let's say 30% of capacity (spent 70%).  
So in order to be able to receive 80% of the initial open channel, I had to empty it using the ZigZag exchnage, sending to myself to a regular BTC address. Then I was able to receive again the full amount of the channel.  
Not sure what do you mean by "maximum capped size" ?  
technically I didn't see any restriction in the amount of opening a channel. It's all about how much the other party of opening a channel is ready/determined to put inside the channel.

My daughter (17) has a stego-wallet too.  
I put on a digital frame, 12 pictures with our family holiday travels.  
Each picture contain 1 seed word of her personal wallet for HODL.  
The sequence of passing pictures on the digital frame is the sequence of the seed words to recover the wallet.  
She knows how to decrypt and recover that wallet and we've tested many times the procedure and check the funds.  
I am increasing the funds on that wallet every month. Never in the same address.  
The seed also is backed up into one of her text, online, hidden into a nice story travel. Only she knows the words location and sequence in that text.  
BTW, she's preparing her math workshop about Bitcoin and will be presented at the end of the course in front of the entire school. The math teacher also was very interested with that work about Bitcoin.

This is the rule of the "bitcoin game": any company/wallet/service that fuck with bitcoin users will be "punished" immediately. We had many examples here, not necessary to mention them. That's why we are vigilant and always warn new people here about all these past "incidents".

As we said many times here before: If you see a merchant using Bitpay, do not use it and recommend them to use BTCPay instead.  
Bitpay is the enemy of Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is not responsible for intermediaries fault. Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid these intermediaries.  
We should do an "information campaign", sending emails to all merchants that are using Bitpay/Conbase and all other intermediaries for BTC payment. Explaining the role of Bitcoin and how to accept BTC without any intermediary as it should be.

A general advice:  
1. Always use aliases of your email address, each time you would register/subscribe to a web/service/whatever. Let's say you register on cats.net, create an alias like cats-net In this way you will always know WHO leaked/sold your info and you could easily just delete that alias and never receive a spam from them.  
2. Never ever use same password anywhere you register/login.  
If you respect these simple two rules, the chances to be hacked, infected, spammed are lower almost to zero.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:05:31
You didn't specify that you want it to use as a privacy control. That is OK.  
Correct answer I think is the amount of opening channel you have open. So no actually up limit. If you open a LN channel of 1000 BTC I wonder who will be ready to accept your "challenge".

**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users).

[Just yesterday]( was posted here a great article about that. And this guide actually was posted every week or month with updates.  
Definitely this guide is a MUST READ and take in consideration for any merchant that want to get into Bitcoin world and exit from the banking cartel.  


If you refer as a "portal" being an intermediary... that means YOU are not using/accepting Bitcoin as it should be.  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
Are you looking for something easier? Any BTC wallet can accept BTC, without permission, any intermediary, just create one and start receiving. You want a simple POS? Example here:

You are, charging a fee for a financial service, so you are by default a financial institution.  


That doesn't mean you are not monitoring those txs. You already have the xpub of the user so all the txs can be monitored. That info + user info is a gold for many chain analysis services + govs + banksters. You will never give any guarantee that the info will not be leaked or given up to 3rd parties, because you can give that guarantee.  
so after all of these points, you still violate the Bitcoin definition.

There is no proof that Conbase implemented segwit.  
There were already a debate about that few weeks ago.  
Conbase can send to segwit addresses due to their internal scripts or whatever they do, but they do not use segwit addresses for Conbase user wallets.  
What you see sending from your Conbase wallet actually is from another wallet (Conbase managed internally). From your actual Conbase wallet you cannot see which address will actually send BTC from that wallet.  
When you select "receive" will never show up a segwit address that belongs to your Conbase wallet (if you can name it YOURS).  
Conbase is a fucking bank and should be avoided as much is possible.

No identity theft risk; no payment information is ever stored.  
Your payment completes immediately  
But Bitpay is doing EXACTLY what is saying is not doing!  Bitpay it stores your identity, it register all your information, it is not completing immediately the payment.  
Newegg, get that shit out! Immediately!  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-12-29 23:32:33
I understand that exchanges uses separate wallets/addresses for traders deposits, but OP it wasn't specified that is about the trading part of Conbase.  
What really matters is segwit implementation for users wallets not main exchanges, because the most numerous txs are at user txs level not deposit/withdrawal from exchanges.

Instead of using that bank, be your own bank with [BTCPay](  
[BTCPay Q&amp;A](  
Better create your own webshop with Wordpress+Woocommerce+BTCPay then a shit shop with Shopify + Conbase.  
I will never buy from a merchant that uses an intermediary for BTC payments!  
You choose to use Bitcoin exactly to not use any intermediary, but yet you want to embrace another intermediary (Conbase).
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...

You see? That's why we do not have real BTC adoption. because people think like you, in the wrong way.  
There is NO "practical case" for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not practical, is the nightmare of the banksters. And that is the main reason we use it!  
1. We use BTC as P2P money, because banks fail to be the trusted ones  
2. We use BTC as fight against banksters, because banksters steal everything from us and put us in debt slavery  
3. We use BTC as a fight against gov surveillance, we need to get back our freedoms and in this moment only BTC can be a guarantee for that.  
4. We use BTC as a form of saving money for our future generations, instead of taking debts forever. The actual form of spending money is WRONG.  
5. We don't use BTC because of his increasing price expressed in fiat money. We use it for his future purchasing power in the future.  
6. We don't use BTC for his lower fees comparing with banking system. Sometimes can be even higher. That's a total bullshit people using it to strip some banking fees. We use it because in this way the banksters can't use it in their favor. Once you leave your money in a bank, the banksters use them to make more fake money, lending to poor people and put them more in debt, by giving them only IOUs fake money, promises in exchange of taking their lives.  
7. We use BTC to strip govs and military complex from direct funding of their commercial wars all over the world.  
.....  
The list goes on and on with many reasons WHY we use BTC.

Bitwage - fully operational, receive salaries in fiat, converted into BTC, split % fiat/BTC, link to Xapo cards, premium acc with own IBAN  
These types of "new banks" will pop up everywhere, but each users should raise some questions:  
1. Are you willing to give all your financial history using these "new banks" with BTC?  
2. Are you moving your BTC from these banks and "wash" them to clean all the tracing possibilities?  
3. When your employer will start paying you in BTC are you willing to still use these banks?

Should be something like 1-2 clicks to setup the predifined outputs and then automatically send the change to those addresses.  
let's say I can setup my own agenda into the wallet, where I can import from an xpub a bunch of addresses. Then the wallet can take from my wallet agenda the list and use it as destinations for change (not into the same wallet change addresses).

Look, I am a true believer of Bitcoin and I support it 100%.  
But I do not see a world using only ONE currency as money.  
In a not a distant future, I see BTC more as a currency reserve, but locally people will deal more with "localcoins" or "your-grocery-store-coin".

Silk Road was a very well organized operation, managed and created from the beginning by gov agencies.  
Then they recruit some "admins" including Ross and make them think they are charge 100%.  
The whole operation was to put Bitcoin in a bad image and create a boogieman, a bad example and a patsy that will be in jail for life.  
**Ross was framed from the beginning!** That's why he never had a fair trial and will rot in jail for life. They are afraid that he will speak the truth.  
Everybody should watch the transcript of the whole story [Railroaded]( and think again about all the aspects.  
Don't let them fool you (again), gov is trying all the time to present Bitcoin as the "bad boy". And they will use Silk Road case all the time.  
BTW, she's a federal bitch cunt trying to wash her hands and sneak into crypto companies with a deceiving speech. She's in the board of directors of Conbase (you wonder why) and also working with Horrorwitz conman. A federal prosecutor will never stop being a wolf.  
**Watch out with these wolfs in sheep skin!** I don't trust in any way this bitch! She's a fucking snake! Stop cheering up when a federal prosecutor is making a speech for Blockchain not Bitcoin, they are just trying to deceive you. It's all a facade...

There are three main teams building Lightning Network nodes currently
Anybody can build his own node. If you try to write about LN at least do it right not misleading people.

Before asking that, you should just try LN. Then you will have your own answer.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:03:59
Mostly will agree with what he's saying.  
But:  


I myself, I didn't made that mess, because I didn't jojned into Bitcoin community for being "filthy rich". I joined because I  [Exit from the Banksters cartel slavery]( **FOREVER!**  
Press, TV, politicians, CEOs, "traders" made that mess. **They should fucking clean it!**  
So fuck off Michael Casey, never accuse a real bitcoiner that is "making a mess" in the financial world. We didn't start this "mess", we will just create a fucking chaos soon!
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:13:57
Please stop shill for that shit!  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.

For mostly merchants is hard to understand that Bitcoin is decentralized money and not another Paypal. When they will understand the real power of Bitcoin, then they will regret using those intermediaries and will move to real decentralized solutions.  
[Like Jameson Loop said here]( you can't say that you are using a decentralized solution on top of Bitcoin if your sidechain is centralized...

Hey Ledger is time for you to use [BTCPay to accept BTC]( for your products!  
It's a shame using Bitpay!  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

I do not use those shirt cards. Are against what Bitcoin stands: no fucking intermediary. I will never go back to fiat.  
Those cards a shame for people using them, going back to fiat is not the solution for going forward with BTC. Those cards are just another banksters trick to fool you to keep using their shit fiat!

Ok now show me that you are able to receive to that address and send from the same one. That means you really have full control of that address. The 3Q... could be easily also a multisig address.  
As I said, Conbase can receive to segwit address but not your real BTC Conbase wallet. What you show me is a BTc address to deposit into Conbase, but not actually into YOUR wallet.  
Conbase segwit implementation is just a lie. Conbase play you all.

Ah no I wasn't saying that people will invest/buying to speculate them. People will just buy them for convenience. Let's say they know will need to buy plane tickets in the next 2 months, so they will go to Bisq or any other instant p2p decentralized exchange, but with btc some planecoins, and use them to buy plane tickets. Or even don't need to go to an exchange, their btc wallet already do the conversion.  
Yes at a first look this looks silly, but you never know what discount, offer, features offer you an airplane company if you buy with theirs coins...

LN also is **DEFAULT** for me. After I pass through Wasabi wallet my income, the next move is to split the original amount in 2-3-4 categories/addresses/wallets:  
- a % goes to LN wallets/channels for usual expenses  
- a % goes to a HW/steganography wallet for HODL  
- a % stays in Wasabi  
- a % goes to Electrum/Core desktop wallet for bigger expenses  
- a % goes to mobile wallets  
I usually use many wallets, sometimes same wallet but the seed imported into different apps that supports BIP39.  
Using only ONE wallet that is really idiotic and in special when is a web wallet (extremely not recommended) or a Conbase, Bitpay shit like that. People are really dumb in this matter and they expose themselves to real dangers.  
**Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly** is not just a say, is also a do, if you don't do it, then remain just a say.

Any node.  
Rule to be respected:  
1. Opening a channel is NOT enough to be able to receive. You need to spend first some/make space on your channel.  
2. You need at least 6 confirmations from mainchain to your new LN channel to be able to have functional your channel  
3. You need at least 3 confirmations on your new channel to be able to spend and 6 (on mainnet) to receive

@_date: 2018-12-04 11:46:20
That conversion is NOT for real bitcoin users. That means the whole point of using BTCPay to take BTC is useless. Why not just stick with already existing solutions for taking fiat directly and leave those who really want to spend their BTC in a direct manner.  
Merchants that uses BTCPay are not obligated to use ONLY BTC! They can still take fiat as usual.

BlueWallet with storage encryption activated and plausible deniability also activated, makes one of the best solution, until now, to secure a mobile wallet.  
Also Samourai wallet has the option to hide the wallet and re-activate it only with a specific code dialed on your keypad.  
Is the same as you described. Paying for an extra chip on your mobile I think no worth, better just keep an external HW and connect it only when is really necessary. Phones can be easily lost/robbed/damaged.

If those exchanges have problems for withdrawing funds, then is a big proof they are fucking liars! So they steal users funds and use them in some kind of scam fractional reserve. Again it's another sign that your btc should NOT be on that exchange!  
That's why is strongly recommended to use only p2p decentralized exchanges, where you are in full control of the funds and exchanges cannot do anything against or manipulate the price with your btc.  
Just put this case: you deposit 1000BTC in a centralized exchange. You do not trade with them or just put a long order and wait. The exchange is saying that your btc are in trade order but in fact they use them to trade in their own interest, with HFT or some kind of algorithm. You are just waiting for your order to happen but meanwhile they are are making shitloads of trades. When you see that you lose, they are just having lags and "technical problems" (how convenient, right?). But in fact they again just manipulate you.

How many times we have to warn people here about the **bad players**? Same happen with Conbase, now Bitpay...  
Wake the fuck up people!  
- Users that have to pay to a Bitpay invoice/merchant: stop/cancel that payment and inform the merchant to switch to a better solution (BTCPay) that follow Bitcoin's main goal - P2P decentralized currency.  
- Merchants, remove that shit Bitpay payment gateway shit and implement a clean, full self-controlled, decentralized, censorship-resistant, open source solution as BTCPay.
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.

Linking any btc address with a real phone/identity is A REAL DANGER for your privacy!  
I really do not understand these people, crying that BTC doesn't have privacy/anonymity but they look to de-anonymize themselves by linking their ID/phone to their wallets.  
STOP doing that! It's really dangerous for you!

You mean US people... they are simply sheeple following other sheeple for using conbase and other shit like that. US people is not meant to think by themselves, they just follow, they are like a bird in a cage, afraid to fly (aka freedom), they simply forget what is freedom.  
You also have to take in consideration that Bisq is NOT for trading/speculating. Is just for people in really need to sell/buy. That's why you will not see many US people there, they all want only lambos now...  
Also the fact that no one is selling means they are HODLing too. This is a good thing for BTC, that means they do not need fiat. People selling on Bisq, they really need fiat. When people stop selling means no one need anymore the worthless goat shit fiat!

It simple: prepare from now with having in your house, a BTC node, a LN node with at least 1-2 open channels, an ASIC miner.  
If at least 50% of all today's BTC users will have that, Bitcoin will never die.  
And don't start yelling that is hard to maintain at home those 3. Now we see appearing a lot of solutions, easy to use, plug &amp; play. Soon will be an explosion of these new devices with all in one.

Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](

[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.

I consider more this post as a spam promoting Conbase than a desperate one about finding the best place to buy BTC. He just want to speculate, so no worth trying to explain him why is better to try to understand what really is BTC and why we use it, instead of speculation.

Using a centralized exchange will imply automatically that you will need to "shapeshift" or "clean" tracks of your income BTC.   
Bitstamp and Coinmama are ok, but still are centralized.  
I would highly recommend decentralized P2P exchanges like Bisq. Why?  
- you are always in control of your money  
- your real identity is not given up to 3rd parties  
- escrow system protect you from scams  
- p2p trades protect you from price/volume manipulation by the exchange itself or other whales  
and so on.

I am using it. It is my duty to use such a wallet because all my income is only in BTC. To protect my own financial privacy and others connected with me (including my payeers) it is imperative to use Wasabi wallet.  
Any btc user that is buying BTC from a centralized/monitored exchange have to pass his BTC through Wasabi wallet, if they care about their financial privacy. This is not about hiding your identity just to buy from darkweb, it is about to protect your privacy rights!

I understand your feeling. But who's fault about this situation?  
Is not that the fault of all those "predators" that want to convert Bitcoin in another "controlled" PayPal and try to move the attention of the masses, that Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid all those "predators" ?  
In the first years, yes it a was a real joy here for any merchant that accept it and today is not viewed as so "cool". This also is because we are bombarded with posts about TAs, bulls, bears, charts shit like that and almost everybody is cheering up ONLY about BTC price.  
People forget WHY the fuck was created Bitcoin! That we should: keep alive that flame and tell to all that Bitcoin is P2P decentralized money not a BS scheme for getting rich quick with shitload of fake money in their pockets.

Sorry for you, but before using a bitcoin services/wallet/app/company you should always look into their history, here on this sub, bitcointalk or many other sources. Any suspicion have to be at least a bit more investigated, not just blindly jump into use it. This is a general aspect with all apps that are poping up now. Do not trust, verify!  
We are in a wild new jungle now, is the beginning of something beautiful, but we should not lay down our vigilance, many are just scammers waiting for their victims and also an important aspect: govs and banksters are creating many apps just to try to monitor/fool/track/fuck bitcoin users.

The best help I can give you is a friendly warning:  
**Warning** - To all Conbase users, please, do not come back here to complain about Conbase, You were warned so many times to NOT use Conbase but you ignored. We are not here to clean their shit, please post your Conbase issues on r/FuckCoinbase or r/Coinbase.  
Coinbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Coinbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.  
  
**[--&gt;Here is a list of exchanges&lt;--](  
[And here is a list of wallets](  
Remember [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin]( so choose wisely your wallet, this is the only one important thing that make difference between wallets.  
Bitcoin = Be your own bank, so act accordingly  
Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc  
Desktop wallets = for managing medium amount of btc  
Paper/steel/hardware wallets = large amount of btc, that you just hodl and do not move for long time.  
Steganography wallets = insanity, paranoia about security :)  
Online/custodial wallets = black hole of your money, use on your own risk. Those are against [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](

No, that means many merchants are dropping the intrusive payment processors and use a direct way to accept BTC without being a monitoring product of Chainalysis/intermediaries.  
Sorry but OpenNode is just another crypto Paypal, not different in any way from all those intermediaries that Bitcoin was designed exactly to avoid them.  
OpenNode is using a custodial wallet for YOUR money, so you will have to trust them if they will release a withdrawal to your own wallet.  
You will never have any guarantee that OpenNode will play fair and will never give your financial data to any "3rd party".  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.

Start local. start with local meetups with friends, neighbors, local merchants, talk to them, not push to them BTC, but just inform them. Never push the idea of getting rich quick with BTC, but offer it as an alternative to the corrupt system.  
If you have a local merchants day, where producers are gathering and sell their products, encourage them to accept BTC. Start always with small ones, that are struggling with banks. Slowly others will get in too.  
I remember, few years ago, it was a small market day and fresh producers came from all over the places around. I convinced a guy to take my BTC for his fresh tomatoes. From then he always put that sign with "Accept Bitcoin here".  
Then after 2 years, I meet him in a bar and he recognize me. He told me that is very grateful that he listen to me. Accepting BTC he open a new market for him and with those BTC he improved his installations. He said: a bank will never do that to me, you did!  
I convinced the owner of a local small grocery near my house to take my BTC. It's a nice pakistani guy that in those times his family was still in Pakistan. He start taking my BTC and from others and in 2 years he could bring his family with him. He is also grateful to my advice to take BTC and now I have always a discount for my shopping in his grocery.  
I convinced the landlord to take my BTC for the rent. Now he pays one of his employees with BTC.  
Do small things and those small things will start working, slowly, will close the circle.

I see this tweet as an opportunity to gain more users for an intermediary payment service (aka another paypal). A marketing campaign paid by Tim Darper capital injection.  
Seems that the tweet was "a response" to Roger's video about LN, but I don't see anywhere in that video a direct offer to OpenNode to take Bcash. So why bother OpenNode to come up with this? Just to make more attention?  
I will not let any marketing campaign to fool me.

@_date: 2018-12-03 01:06:52
So what? Nobody will stop those addresses to be used or the coins to be used.  
Let's say you receive 1 BTC from one of those addresses. Make a new tx sending to 1000 new addresses splitting the original amount using Wasabi wallet. Then let them try to follow up that tx that also will get soon into a mixing tx.  
**Nothing to worry about a damn shit propaganda of "blacklisted" addresses** Is just to scare out the shit noobs.  
 
A REAL blacklist is when you can't move your coins from an address because the miners will not mine/allow it. But in that case Bitcoin cease to exist (aka see the fork intent of S2X).  
[Here is a great explanation WHY we don't care!](
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:02:51
Is good for everybody movements like this.  
Actually I did my "proof of keys" event in 2015 when I start being paid in BTC and closed my bank accounts.  
From then, I have ZERO BTC on exchanges, only on my own wallets.

There are many ways to secure/store/hide your keys. You just have to be a bit more inventive.  
Even with this tool you can play more,  (also mobile app).  
Just an example: put a 12 word seed into a passphrase. Then you can just send that passphrase to anybody in the world, without knowing that is carrying a seed wallet. Or he/she may know, but nobody else :) This is a way of transacting with BTC without creating any tx on the blockchain.

Bitcoin is in bed with some kind of anarchy. It cannot work with well established "democracies" nor communist regimes.  
People always have the wrong idea that anarchy = chaos/destruction/violence/terrorists but in fact anarchy is more = almost zero govern. Anarchy is governance ruled by each participant in the society. And this fit exactly with what Bitcoin is.  
Only MSM and govs wants you to present anarchy as a violent society, but in fact they are afraid of anarchy that will take their well warm seats. Consider anarchy as a direct vote democracy. People decide for themselves what will do with their money.

Yes, what you described is a "standard" today of app developers. I do not agree also with this practice. But I do not complain about.  
Testing a new wallet with few satoshis, will not affect you so much on "losing money". It helps YOU firstly to have an idea about all wallet products out there. Being well educated in this matter makes you more prepared, vigilant to not lose money.  
Nobody says to blindly trust BlueWallet devs with all your money. I tested almost all wallets on mobile, first for me, not for devs. Learning is the first step in being educated about Bitcoin and how not to lose money. From 2012, when I started, until now, not even 1 satoshi lost.

If do not intend to throw you few money into trading shit techniques, I would suggest this:  
1. Open an acc on Bitwage.com  
2. Make all the setup for that acc, regarding your activity work (freelancer, employee, contractor)  
3. Take the payment details from Bitwage acc and give it to your employer/payer to pay your work in his regular currency  
4. You receive the payment and next business day you get your BTC straight to your own BTC wallet. No tradings, no prices, no orders, no dips no highs, just Bitcoin. If you still need some fiat you could split your income in % of BTC/fiat as you please.  
This is the best way, easy and affordable way to **be paid in BTC**.  
Next step is going to buy by yourself more BTC in a more private way using  But that is more advanced way.  
First you need to get some BTC, learn more how to use it and then we will tell you more "secrets".

@_date: 2018-12-03 12:20:28
My opinion:  
- [Pro] is a good start, to make BTC users to start spending their BTC  
- [Contra] is (still) a centralized intermediary, that is taking all those BTC  
- [Contra] the merchant is NOT encouraged to take BTC, in this way he will never have the will to adopt BTC  
- [Contra] BTC is not pushed back into economy to be used as fluent P2P money, it stays in the hands of intermediary, that maybe will sell it for fiat on centralized exchanges and will create even more volatility  
- [Contra] Point of failure - I have to trust this intermediary to fulfill my order. If they fail to finish my order, I can lose my BTC and also not receiving the product. If the merchant will take BTC but can't deliver the product then is a matter of commercial contract violation and it's more easier to resolve it.  
I am still for pushing, educating, helping the merchants to take directly our BTC. It is all parties best interest!

So what? Nobody will stop those addresses to be used or the coins to be used.  
Let's say you receive 1 BTC from one of those addresses. Make a new tx sending to 1000 new addresses splitting the original amount. Then let them try to follow up that tx that also will get soon into a mixing tx.  
**Nothing to worry about a damn shit propaganda of "blacklisted" addresses** Is just to scare out the shit noobs.  
A REAL blacklist is when you can't move your coins from an address because the miners will not mine/allow it. But in that case Bitcoin cease to exist.

We are still in early phase of adoption.  
Just asking random people on streets about Bitcoin will never give you the right answer. People are influenced by others easily when they do not know the right answer. Aka many are just sheeple. There are tons of studies regarding this aspect.  
First, people have to wake up and start to understand more about money, who controls the money supply, why, how etc. If they do not understand this important step, they will never understand WHY Bitcoin exist and will have a wrong opinion about Bitcoin as a concept.  
Second, people need to be educated, or at least well, fairly, objective informed about Bitcoin, without entering in technical details.  
Third, people have to see in Bitcoin, each one for himself, his own "exit" strategy, applying it where he needs more, respecting the rules of Bitcoin.  
Fourth, (like u/sleevedheart said [here]( very well) "when you will have on your keyboard the sign of $/€ with B, then you have adoption".

Wrong, you are wrong informed. Here  and many others that decided to NOT use any intermediary for BTC payments.  
As you, many merchants also are wrong informed about how to take BTC, because they were "invaded" by all these new paypals offers and they do not investigate more other options.  
When you see merchant using an intermediary, it is your duty as a bitcoiner to inform them that they are doing wrong. Duty, because is about your privacy and merchant privacy and all the rest.

Bitcoins was created exactly to avoid all these intermediaries like paypal. Now people want to go back to these intermediaries for Bitcoin. It's stupid and useless. We try to make Bitcoin even more secure and private with LN and people still want to use an intermediary. Why use BTC then? People are lost, they can't think for themselves.

1st rule: use a wallet that respect [The Golden Rule of Bitcoin](  
2nd rule: always "clean" your BTC  income that come from a centralized/regulated entity. Using Wasabi wallet is the best option today.  
Wallets to be considered:  
Mobile: BTC LN, Eclair, Electrum, BlueWallet, Samourai, Mycelium, Schildbach, Coinomi and some others.  
Desktop: Electrum, Core, Wasabi, Armory and some more others.  
HW: Trezor, Ledger, Archos, IcyWallet (for blind people), KeepKey etc  
[Here you have a better comparison](
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:21:18
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:10:50
First you need to ask yourself this: why do you want BTC on your website?  
If the answer is just for having more money/is trending/to exchange BTC for USD/fiat money/I don't care what is BTC, then you better just stick with fiat and VISA/Paypal, Bitcoin is not for you.  
If the answer is Bitcoin is the future/I believe in Bitcoin's values/offer to my web visitors a private way to trade with me/I will use BTC to buy things I need and/or pay employees/use BTC as money/HODL BTC earned from my web, then Bitcoin using [BTCPay solution]( and also a [NODL solution]( for total control of your money and transactions, will be the best way to do it.  
There are also intermediaries for doing that job for you, but then you are back to square one: use Bitcoin with Paypal like intermediaries is just against all Bitcoin stands for. [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**   
Remember: those intermediaries will close your account as easy as the VISA/Paypal/banks will close your accounts. There is no difference. Having your own "bank" literally will offer you total independence and control of your money and customers.

Please do that experiment and show us the results where you extract the private keys from that wallet. Enlighten us! Stop living in a "hacker movie"-
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:33:46
1. Use Wasabi wallet  
2. Never keep your BTC on a custodial/exchange wallet  
3. If you buy from a "regulated" centralized exchange, always "clean" your BTC by mixing/shapeshift them, to not be anymore linked to YOUR real ID. Wasabi wallet is great for this.  
4. Do not pay with BTC to a merchant that uses a 3rd party payment processor that require you to signup/leave your real name.  
5. Use Lightning Network, it will keep your real ID/BTC addresses even more private.  
6. Never post any of your BTC addresses in public and use those addresses to link your ID. Before using the BTC from those addresses, "clean" them (see point 3).  
7. If you are ever paid in BTC for your work/have a regulr income in BTC, **always** "clean" that income. Split the income into 4-5 txs, spread to mixers (see point 1).  
8. NEVER do like idiots do: use your car license plate as BITCOIN. Be discreet, play the "poor guy". You have nothing to lose.
It's up to each user how to interpret and execute "Be your own bank", by controlling your own privacy.

No, that means many merchants are dropping the intrusive payment processors and use a direct way to accept BTC without being a monitoring product of Chainalysis/intermediaries.  
Sorry but OpenNode is just another crypto Paypal, not different in any way from all those intermediaries that Bitcoin was designed exactly to avoid them.  
OpenNode is using a custodial wallet for YOUR money, so you will have to trust them if they will release a withdrawal to your own wallet.  
You will never have any guarantee that OpenNode will play fair and will never give your financial data to any "3rd party".

Whaaat? You get it wrong the term "paper wallets". A paper is just a paper, where you write a secret. Keeping on a paper just ONE address private key is really stoooopid.  
A wallet contains many addresses, that's why the easiest way to save a wallet on a paper is to write down the seed (better split it in many papers).  
To fund the addresses from that wallet is not necessary to open in full mode that wallet, a read only mode is enough, or just type the BTC address or scan the QR code (there are many QR code generators out there) to receive funds.

I think this project is more a like they created the wallet app for themselves and if all features come up with success they offer it open source to the public.  
Use it if you like or ignore it. It's free anyway, the devs never request any money or data from you.  
For a new wallet  would wait and see. Is good for testing, but for fuck sake, why people have to jump and put all their money into just one wallet app? I regularly use 4-5 different wallet apps and never put all BTC in one.

This could be a start for watching movies and pay for them, directly to the creator, with BTC, using LN. In the past we had waychmybit.com that was quite good, but they stopped the project.
