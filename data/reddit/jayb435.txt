Pfff, I know where you probably heard that, but I think I'd do well to inform you that Women obsess over a ton of things, but one of he biggest things is building pressure and releasing it. Case in point, compliment followed by insult, works every time. Subtle sexual  jokes, kissing/sexual actions. It's a pattern man. That or you're talking about lesbos, which, see, I get a lot of dudes who have that problem. Solution? Shock therapy. That or I tell them to fuck  off, and if they don't I have a dual purpose for the therapy gear! More bang for your buck. Or zap.

Technically speaking I can't buy coins as a minor, but I want to put some in an account anyways so I need to work for cryptos. No regular old buying... sucks ass. Panhandling seems like hard shit dude, I suck  at lying or scamming  of any sort.

Real answer is getting DNM stuff
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:49:02
Damn that's stupid but I'm not sure why any 18+ company would be using crypto. You dont exactly want to appeal to an anonymous payment method if you want to confirm age of clients.

Bank of america and the USPS really show how unsurvivably inadequate the US government is
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:09:32
I see the point, I guess.

Really? Thats surprising.

Obviously fucking satoshi nakomoto is a white name; y'all are just crazy. Hes japanese if you want to think hes japanese. If enough people think that he becomes Japanese. Thats the point in anonymity.

Cool but what I'm saying is that we need to stop all the "get this coin to 10w9o29p02029whzank/3 trillionabilliononillion" spam. It's annoying

Whatever buddy
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:49:38
Seriously though what the fuck is this and how does it work?  
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:58:56
Well, I say that because it's dependent on multiple factors related to trust, like mining. If we stopped mining completely, bitcoin would be stuck at a certain amount of coins permanently which would be survivable for a while, but eventually people would get fucked by transaction fees and people selling bitcoin out for real cash.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:55:04
really? I don't know how the inner aspects of moving btc actually work, because there's regular ledger shit and I assume they'd be able to finish the block. I guess not.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:25:33
I mean, I would consider investing around 1/6 of my money into bitcoin; given that 20 bucks of btc around 8 years ago is now 80 million dollars. That's a huge fucking rise.
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:03:05
100 thousand dollars to a million dollars isn't "Getting Rich?" A hundred to a thousand isn't "getting rich for a little twerp kid and probably as one?" Plus, he could have sold at 18 k. I'd say going from potentially 100k to 1.8 mil is getting rich. I'd say going from being a retard like you to being slightly smarter; if at all possible with your low comprehension of reality; is getting rich. In fact, infinitely richer: you started with 0 IQ and you have 1 IQ now. Good fucking job.

Are you sure you aren't just regretting not selling at 18k?

What a genius. I love earning a negative amount of bitcoins.

But this was just his first high... wait till he peaks ;). If he survives the fall, that is.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:41:37
How does it make the creator money? Do they start a ICO off of it? Mine their own coin while it's still easy? Sale of tokens to investors? Donations? Is it pick and choose on these options? Regardless this actually sounds really useful. Thanks, I'm probably going to make something off of it.

So.. you're admitting you're filled with a dangerous combination of embarrassment, guilt, self-doubt, and envy? '
That's embarrassing. Maybe it'll offset your saltiness balance.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:22:21
Common misconception. Bitcoin price is based on public trust, not individual investments.
