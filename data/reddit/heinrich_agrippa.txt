Oh, come now. I was only trying to illustrate that with not only the massive spike in BTC value, followed shortly thereafter by an unprecedented spike in LTC value and previously down-on-their luck alts like FTC, TRC, NMC, PPC and XPM suddenly, inexplicably and unpredictably becoming several times as valuable at different moments. Coupled with massive volatility, it really does feel like “just pick something and see what happens” style trading is sometimes the most viable thing to do.
I guess I should have anticipated the negative reaction given the attitudes I’ve seen towards trading here. There’s a difference between a BTC enthusiast and a BTC zealot. I see a lot of the latter. Personally, I get a little turned off by rhetoric which increasingly is starting to look like this:
“Bitcoin is intrinsically superior to fiat. Thou shalt only buy and hold BTC. To use BTC as a means to acquire more fiat is a corruption of the True purpose of BTC and is heresy! Only the greedy and shortsighted sell BTC back for fiat; for only those of pure faith shall reap the rewards of eternal wealth at the coming of the kingdom of BTC. And lo, those who clung to their idolatry of fiat shall be cast down unto poverty for all time! Beware the alts, for they are the false shepherds which seek to lead you astray. Those of little faith who diversify their portfolios and so consort with alts are no better than worshipers of fiat. They too shall be denied entry unto the Kindgom of BTC and cast down unto the purgatory of perpetual middle class. Hear well these words, for only by complete faith in BTC shall ye be granted eternal wealth in the kingdom of BTC.”
