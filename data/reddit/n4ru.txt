SegWit increases capacity on-chain by increasing blocksizes because it allows SW to take up 4x the space of normal tx while only counting as 1x the space. It's really no different than increasing block size directly except for savings a tiny amount of space by separating the witness data.

As lovely as this idea is, it's impossible to execute on any widespread hardware due to spoofing. If this is launched, there's no chance that it won't immediately become worthless due to bots picking up every single deposit. 
The only significant way to prevent spoofing is to set a cap on how fast someone can jump from location to location, but this is easily voided by spamming new accounts. 
A question doesn't solve these issues because it would still be worthwhile to manually sit there and answer them while botting the rest.

That's the same as holding your money in cash or any free bank. The entire point of BTC is to avoid counterparty risk, and if said bank goes under, you lose your money anyway.

What the fuck are you on about? $95 for millions is fine, but the average person isn't going to transfer millions, and they're not going to have a linearly scaled down fee when they do it. It's cheaper to transfer more, but the base fee is too high. The fee isn't "static", it's based on the byte count of the tx, which is higher if you have more UTXO. Do you even know how Bitcoin works?

@_date: 2017-09-02 21:19:03


Wouldn't matter, that's the point of using an airgapped offline wallet. I'd wipe the machine after. That's why the only vulnerable spot is the tx being signed that one time.


Right, there's no way to do this with ZERO trust (even with a Ledger you are trusting the ledger software), but trusting a tool that only verifies and doesn't actually send is better than trusting wallet software that does both (less incentive for the standalone verifier to lie if it isn't the one getting the coins).

@_date: 2017-09-02 20:51:05


Why not? If the offline wallet that holds the private key generates a fake transaction and claims to have signed the input I gave it, it would be malicious.
Lets say the BCH wallet is "evil", is offline, and it has my private key. I give it an unsigned tx to send my BCH to an exchange. Can't the evil wallet now generate an entirely new tx sending my REAL BTC elsewhere, and tell me it's my signed tx sending my BCH to an exchange? Also, can't I verify it is or isn't doing that, the same way the actual blockchain does so when it processes tx? It seems like trusting a tx verifier requires the least trust. That should be possible, otherwise there would be no way for the blockchain itself to verify sent tx.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:56:33
I know it's about BCH, but at least here there's some technical discussion between shilling. There it's nothing but.
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:53:50


I don't expect r/btc to know how to do it.
You're right that even offline theoretically I'm trusting the wallet code to not generate a BTC tx instead. I suppose I don't have another choice other than moving the BTC using an offline wallet first in which case I end up changing the key anyway.
However, I think as long as I send a tx transaction to another wallet I control (not an exchange), I can be fairly safe since the BCH code would at least be airgapped (I can do the raw broadcast without the BCH wallet) and at worst I send the BTC to another address I own. Though I suppose I'm still trusting the wallet to not sign a new tx sending it elsewhere. Ugh.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:13:33


Why would this matter? For the sake of my paranoid argument, a malicious wallet masquerading as a BCH wallet could easily have the code written to do either chain, that's the point.


I'd be giving a tx generated by an online wallet and sign it with the offline wallet that has my BCH/BTC private key, which is where the above issue comes in.


You can verify a tx without broadcasting it AFAIK, I'm just wondering if a tool exists for BCH to do so. I'm not talking about confirmations or anything like that. I'm talking about simply reading the transaction data without actually sending it out.


This is my last resort. I'd rather write my own transaction verifier (which is looking to be more and more likely what I'll have to do) than to have to move my existing cold storage to a new wallet.

As someone who was overwhelmingly in support for the NYA, and was sad when it was dissolved and S2X failed, why do you say "not necessarily S2X"? I thought it was not only a good compromise but a great step forward. I think that once we hit the eventual on-chain scaling wall (because Moore's Law is dead and adoption will surpass the feasibility of just using large drive space/bandwidth), we will require LN/SW to scale. Thus I personally think that to see Visa scale adoption we need a combination of large block sizes, a second layer solution, SW, and things like Schnorr sigs.

I ended up generating my own addresses, using blockchain.info's address balance API, then checking that for payments.

I have a close friend who works directly at Etsy. I spoke to him about it and he told me that the idea has already come up but was rejected due to the volatility of bitcoin and it was assumed it wouldn't be used enough to make the implementation worthwhile. I mentioned bitpay but that was apparently rejected as well.

How do you deposit cash into IAFCU accounts?

We did ask. We were customers  and  that day that paid in BTC. Someone else from this subreddit drove down from NY to pay with Bitcoin as well earlier in the day.

Is it known if BTCGuild is in the latter situation where it prioritizes fees? If not, then I guess the attack is basically irrelevant without almost everyone else on the network doing so.

He withdrew cash from Mt. Gox into Dwolla. It was no longer BTC at that point.
^(My loan to him was returned pretty quickly with 25% interest, if that's what you're referring to with your Nigeria reference...)

If an address is generated by a computer or other source, and then imported into a blockchain wallet, is it still vulnerable?

The answer is a clear yes, considering the question asked is if BTC guild could potentially do it. They have a realistically high chance to plan it out and attack the network if they wanted to.

In reference to the pedo links - The data was NOT in anyway related to the values of any transactions. The data was placed into the block itself by the miner, which you've made clear you simply don't understand.
**For those interested in seeing the links in the blockchain itself:** In .bitcoin/blocks do strings -20 blk00053.dat | less 
In fact, the genesis block itself was mined with the following text embedded in it: *"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"*
There is also a well known miner/pool that constantly injects bible phrases into the blockchain. Here's a sample of text: 
No transaction values, no wasting money.

The money was in Dwolla being sent towards Mt. Gox. At that point I believe his personal bank is no longer involved. He plans to sue eventually once he has the money to but can't afford it immediately.

My figure was calculating the chance that you find one block in 10 minutes (or the chance of a block right after you already got one). The chances of you finding 2 blocks back to back in a 48 hour period would be ~0.000002%, far less.
Buy a lottery ticket.
If you are telling the truth, you're in the minority. Pool mining is still more profitable.

It seems there was a misunderstanding on my part. He was sending money BACK to Gox from Dwolla, not the other way around.

Tx without fees take much much longer to process and confirm through the network.
If one were to send a Tx, and then double spend their coin with a high fee (say, 0.1BTC), it would guarantee that the first Tx would not confirm, and the second one would.
If you send 1 BTC to SatoshiDice or SatoshiCircle and win, you simply wait much longer for the payout.
However, if you lose, you can, in theory, do the above to prevent the payment to them from ever confirming compared to the Tx with a fee.

Absolutely nothing except hash calculation (if we're assuming most of the power is from ASICs, which it will be very soon)...
