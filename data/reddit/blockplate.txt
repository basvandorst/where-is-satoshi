Metal isn’t always the answer. Paper can be just as effective and as long as you’re able to sleep at night, you’re just fine. That being said, we wrote up a [guide on storing backups on paper]( We hope that helps!

Thanks for the kind words!
Back when we came up with the center punch method a couple years ago, there was only Cryptosteel and metal stamps. 
It took us *awhile* to come up with something that took the simplicity and durability of stamping a metal plate but being non-intimidating and easy to do like a Cryptosteel.
We’re right there with you in the terms of being expensive. We also didn’t think engraved metal plates would cost so much. Possibly because we were dead set on [laser etching instead of laser marking]( and manufacturing in the US. We wanted to keep quality high and for you to be able to physically feel the longevity. But it led us to being priced too low.
When we first offered Blockplates, we lost money on each one. To give you an idea, it costs us $20.55 each plate alone (so $41.10 for the standard two-packs we offer). We were losing a couple bucks on each one (not including the labor, packaging, and development costs which made it even worse).
To survive, we made the decision to raise prices but at the same time re-design how we manufactured them to provide more value such as [adding a surface finish and a deeper engraving depth](
These improvements did increase our costs but at the same time we increased our pricing so we weren’t losing money on each plate.
Our goal is still to provide a somewhat affordable product but still being able to grow as business and develop new products.
Anyway thanks for reading my long winded story about how we started out. As a thanks, feel free to PM me for a 10% off code to help a bit with costs.

Hey, thanks for the tip!
Still fully functional, but falls short of full price quality due to minor aesthetic flaws.
And we apologize for the confusion. We were referring to Thanksgiving dinner seconds not your personal sexual preferences. That’s none of our business. :)

Tamper evident bags are **still included free** with seconds orders.

[We ready.](
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:49:48
We actually have **never** offered seconds. (They are discounted off standard prices, $69 for 2.0, $59 for 1.0)
We decided to this year and only for this weekend. 
So it’s a first for us.
Maybe it’ll come back. Maybe not.
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:32:37
Great question. Glad you asked!
Deeper engraving and a better surface finish on the 2.0.

@_date: 2019-11-02 06:01:36
Heeyyyy, that’s us. Thanks for the mention!Here for any questions.
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:48:15
Thanks for giving us a chance to meet your expectations! We’ll get out your order ASAP.
They would hang out in storage. Sometimes one of us would grab one to use personally.
Lopp did do us a solid. He ordered one incognito so we had no idea.
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:32:26
We’ll play. *Seconds Sale*.
All Blockplates aren't perfect and some didn't make the cut. That doesn't mean they don't deserve love!
Seconds are discounted from first prices (**25% OFF**) and are only available through **Monday (or until supplies last)**
Edit: oh yeah, **FREE US Shipping** and **$9.95 flat rate international shipping**
@_date: 2019-11-05 23:10:09
Oh, you’re also a Redditor.
Congratulations on the auction. I’m glad it turned out well!
Let me know if you want to collaborate in the future. This was fun.
@_date: 2019-11-28 14:01:57
Yeah I hope so too 
@_date: 2019-10-22 14:42:34
Hey...that’s my question...
The easiest way would by the first (or last) seed word (e.g. the “Milk” wallet) and keeping that information elsewhere. But, is that realistically done?

No room for a hole ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
But, we can always make it longer.

Oh hey there :). Thanks for the mention. 
By the way, we are working on a SLIP39 version of the Blockplate.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:14:52
Well, in terms of seed protection, I was implying [this](
But in all seriousness, there are a multitude of ways and it’s too much for one comment.
I’ll refer to excellent write up on seeds and seed security:
I don’t outright recommend metal seed storage because everyone is different in terms of what works for them. I recommend you choose whichever let’s you sleep at night because your mental well being is most important.

Remember to also use seed protection to prevent unauthorized or unintentional access.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:13:37
Thanks! We didn’t even know he ordered one to test. He’s so sneaky.
Great question! They come in two packs. Being our first product, we wanted to minimize size and be as modular as possible. We found it also gets a bit difficult to match up the spaces with the letters the more words you add.
But, we are working on the next variant which *may* do just that as we believe we have a solution to that issue.
You mind reader you.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:15:36
Congratulations on the launch Alex :)
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:40:57
I believe because we’d win. Again :)

A little more on this: 
It is not only the high heat and pressure during the lamination process that damages the structural integrity of the paper. The materials used in lamination may contribute to its deterioration as well.
The plastic used in lamination has historically been cellulose acetate, which is inherently unstable becoming acidic over time and results in deterioration. Modern lamination materials utilize adhesives, which can be themselves acidic, creating a compromising environment for the paper.
In addition, I recommend you use acid free paper and pencil to write your seed and store it in an enclosed non-acidic environment. 
We wrote a [detailed guide]( on preserving a seed stored paper for the long run.
If you absolutely must laminate because you cannot abstain from the sensation of trapping something between two pieces of plastic under heat and pressure, make another non-laminated copy. Redundancy also promotes longevity.
@_date: 2019-04-29 19:27:51
You rang?
It originally and still does come in a standard [double pack]( We did this to allow seed splitting/separation for additional security purposes.
But we, recently introduced offering single packs since [some wallets have been limiting to 12 word seeds]( given they are ~~just as safe~~ still OK.
When we were first designing and testing the layout, we found that the more words you have on a single side, the more difficult it is to match up the grid square with the letter. Thus, we limited each side to have 6 words.
Edit: clarification

The other payment options are after customer and shipping information has been filled out. Unfortunately, no shipping outside the US at the moment with our current pre-sale. We’d like to work out the logistics to prevent lost orders and long shipping times with international orders.

Hi, Jeff from Blockplate here. We also accept various credit cards  (Visa, MasterCard, Amex) and Bitcoin/Litecoin. One center punch is included free with each order (rather than each x2 plate pack). We’re actually absorbing the costs of the punches given that it’s not very common to own a center punch. Although, if you do order more than two packs and need more than one center punch (such as giving it to a friend), feel free to contact us.

We finally got some time to lurk reddit today (decided to take some no-internet family time yesterday) and stumbled upon this.
Thank you so much for giving us a shout out. We're flattered :D
This is a great guide and **definitely** wiki worthy. In-depth information and the formatting is phenomenal.
We'll keep an eye on this thread if there are any questions!
Edit: Oh one more thing, we believe it is the [Blockplate 2.0]( that Lopp actually tested
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:01:16
Great question.
**Short answer:**
-	deeper, darker engraving
-	higher quality surface finish 
-	thus, higher resistance to abusive conditions
Here is a [comparison picture](
**Longer answer:**
2.0 is laser engraved (previously etched).
Etching removes a minimal amount of material (less than 0.001 in or 0.0254 mm, about the thickness of a human hair). You’re able to feel the depth with your finger nail.
Engraving is deeper. It withstands abrasion significantly more because many more surface layers have to be removed in order to get to the end of the engraving depth. You’re able to feel it with any part of your body.
There is an improved surface finish as well. This means polishing the surface to remove any defects or blemishes. Again, improves resistance to corrosion and abrasion.
We mainly focused to improve its durability and longevity, but it turns out that makes it more aesthetically pleasing as well.

Thanks for posting this We’ll be hanging out here for awhile if you guys have any questions. We’d love to to answer them.
