KFC Canada has had a decent social game for a while.

Yep, time to go bargain hunting!

Taking out a mortgage to buy at ATH is stupid. If he bought on the dip to under 12k he’d be a genius.
*edit: seems subtle sarcasm is lost on you all*

Yup, this was my concern as well.
I mean - I would genuinely hope someone would not piggy-back off such an obviously good and generous person to dupe a community for their own personal gain - but then again, this is the internet.
I try to believe the best in people but I'd wait for confirmation on Twitter before anything.

I'm going to assume you're just ignorant on crypto in general.
[This]( may give you a better overview of what is going on. It's a TED Talk, so it's aimed at the uninformed.
As with all things in life - it's alright to be skeptical, but it's also important to be open.

a lot of people have no idea what they're doing and will run for the hills screaming end of days
seasoned btc hodlers will barely notice, and with wall street attention now i feel the buying is going to get even crazier once it db's
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:41
The more you buy, the cheaper they get!
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:47:59
i must’ve dropped this
@_date: 2019-07-21 05:41:44
ROLL TIDE
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:07:45
truthfully, this drop has me much more excited than the past couple weeks run up - it’s going to be a crypto sale for boxing day!
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:49:36
I don’t think taking out a mortgage to buy at any point would be a genius move. It’s reckless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:47:40
I was guessing correction to 12-13 when this run passed 15, but now I'm thinking it may bottom almost to 10 due to all the shaky hands.

The key difference however is this time there are many competitors that can do what BTC does, but better.
It very well could stay the digitalgoldstandard because of how the entire market formed - but if it doesn't, it'll be pretty easy to spot the reasons why.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:22
Because alt values are tied to satoshi.

Or better yet, buy another $1000 now and say you bought $2000 @ a reasonable $16,500.

This is good for Dentacoin.

You have a $400 bill for the dentist.
Go online, buy $400 worth of bitcoin.
Pay dentist $320.
You've now increased your bitcoin by $80 and helped the ecosystem.

Doesn’t look like anything to me.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:13:50

Bake ‘em away, toys!

Yep. Good ear.

And all I could think about the past few weeks was [this scene](

Literally just made the same face.
