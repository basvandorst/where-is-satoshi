Who wants to take a job that is going to be replaced by a robot in a few years anyway.

Banking went from, "Keep your money safe with us and watch it grow." to "Fuck you, pay me, or you can't function financially."
This is why Bitcoin will be 5k soon and probably go higher in the years to come.

Good luck enforcing any of this bullshit.  The people of New York will be the only ones to suffer, when we get blocked from any site related to cryptocurrencies as a result of this proposed regulation.  Fuck you Cuomo, and fuck you NYDFS.

I had my recurring buy fail as well on August 1st.  I notified support through the chat service and was told to email them so they could escalate my case.  Still no word yet.

I knew this was going to happen.  It still scares the shit out of me.

Unfortunately, such a system would be illegal.  This is why it doesn't already exist.  The federal government shuts companies like this down.

There is a very good reason they reduced the instant buy to 1.  Everyone and there whole extended family is clamoring to buy bitcoin in the US right now.  Coinbase is the only safe way to get it instantly.  They are trying to encourage stability by limiting this feature, and it is working.  The value is climbing right now, but at a nice steady pace.  I feel if 50btc instabuys were still going on btc would be over $2k right now.  Great for those speculating, bad for businesses that want to accept this currency.

The reason this all happened was his divorce.  He actually saved you all.  Cryptsy was "hacked" so his wife couldn't get anything out of the company.  Then when his divorce was over, he made a deal with the "hacker" to get the coin back.

"Brackett said the idea of paying a ransom to a software hacker didn't appeal to the sheriff's office, but that Burgess Computer covered the equivalent of 300 euros in bitcoin currency ($318) ransom to a European bank account."
So, apparently you have to send your bitcoin to the hackers European bank account.  wtf lol.
