Yeah, I'l let someone with more experience answer that as there's also the issue of currency rates. No idea, It's a minefield and I don't think many of my Tax advisors in my country have enough experience yet to deal with it properly.
Hopefully in a year or two, most will have enough experience to advise properly.

This is exactly why I can't be bothered to trade the Alts, Like for like transactions are taxable so evry time you took profit on say Ripple and used that Ripple profit to buy Verge etc., you need to calculate the tax on the fiat value of that success and put it to one side for the taxman. It's completely horrible I know and it seems unfair to everyone that we take all the risk and stress and the taxman gets so much from us whilst not accepting any of the risk. Speaking of  which, you can offset any losing trades against the tax as well so make sure you calculate your losses as well.

5k on Oct 12th / 10k on Nov 29th, Double your money in 48 days. Let that sink in.

They can challenge again but anyone who witness the BCH pump will now be very cautious after seeing it dump so much after. Realistically if I wanted to get into BCH now, I would expoect maybe half the pump and gain another smaller dump. Who wants to risk it?  
I anticipate 6500 by the end of the day and back over 7k by the end of the week.

GDAXX is a bloody nuisance to register with, even if you Have a Coinbase account setup already, They insist on another form of ID and/Or webcam access. I ahve been trying for days to open mine.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:46:23
looking promising, although i expect after this bounce the decline may resume on Monday
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:57:19
Trying the 4100 now!! yay

You need to put things into perspective, BC is 450% up YoY, Just hold and stop looking at graphs.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:20:49
what do you mean you can't buy 1 full BC from coinbase? You certainly can. Or do you mean yourself personally are not in a position to buy one full one.?

When it becomes easier to trade in Crypto is when this will explode.
At the moment it's far too complicated to open an account, then make a wallet and understand keys etc, Hash, soft wallets, hard/hot wallets, blockchains. I mention them to most people and their eyes just glaze over. Until it's as easy to use as something like PayPal their won't be mass adoption. But... If you believe those days will eventually come,like me,then hold on to your coins

sod em, open a coinbase account instead
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:37:35
No, You have to load up your account first with funds and then once they are on your account you can buy the BC 
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:50:30
Back up again now
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:45:05
GDAX exchange is down, That app must be linked to it? Coinbase had no price updatefor over 2 hours.
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:59:29
Looks like [Coingecko]( is keeping up.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:07:54
But everyone knows that and will buy ahead so by that time the increase will be mostly factored in, In fact, what you may see is a decline as traders take profit. Buy the rumor sell the news type of thing

API issues, being worked on. currently at 3,732
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:32:20
from selling all week. Traders don't like to leave open positions in the market over the weekend so they close out last thing Friday. That means If i have had open short positions all week,m which appears that most traders have, then i will have to  close them by last thing friday , hence the bounce. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:54:44
Friday afternoon will be a bounce back as Traders take profits. Common practice . 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:52:38
we're coming!!
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:52:55
It's a Friday, Expect dips until late afternoon and then a bounce as traders take their weeks profits. I reckon you will see a decent bounce back this afternoon.

Probably over investing  
Not taking spread and fees into consideration when calculating P/L,   
Panicking when the market becomes volatile.

Forgot to mention that although already Bank verified with Coinbase you will need to add yet another form of CAMERA identity before GDax will let you open an account. Apparently having already provided a Passport isn't enough.

well, It has to go through 6-8k before it gets to 10k. They may as well have asked who thinks it will be above 6k.

I reality, if BTC had climbed to 5 cent he would have sold it all and done well. It's extremely unlikely there any holders left from those days, any sensible person would have taken profit when they were 1000X  its' unfathomable that they wouldn't.
