YOU ARE WRONG. The State doesn't GET the money, they hold it in a searchable fund so beneficiaries can search for it. For example, your aunt or uncle dies and lives in NY, you can search the database for unknown assets. Any legit beneficiary can claim it. This is consumer protection, else how would a rrelative know about an unknown deposit box or coinbase account

We always say buyer beware but at some point you need some safeguards. Come on, for bitcoin to become mainstream there has to be some consumer safety. Else it will stay as a niche item.

The revelations get murkier from there. For the first time, the public learned that Butterfly Labs runs its own Bitcoin mining pool for “testing” purposes—and the company uses this test pool to make money. “[BFL] earns mining income from their burn testing of machines as well as service fees charged to Eclipse customers,” documents state. This revelation represents some of the worst fears held by skeptics of BFL—that the company is using its own hardware to profit privately before sending miners to people who actually paid for them.

Gox should go into the business textbooks as a case study on how to screw up a potentially billion dollar company. They had nearly 70% market share - a HUGE jump on coinbase, bitstamp, and pretty much everyone. In fact, none of these competitors would have even gotten traction if it weren't for the constant screwups at Gox. This guy should have hired a real team and could have taken Gox into another Paypal as far as market cap. Instead, he ran it from a potentially billion dollar company into near insolvency.

The Constitution actually prohibits the Federal government from printing paper currency. Something about how paper money causes inflation and robs the people of their wealth (kind of nutty huh?). The Treasury cannot create paper money (*it can print the paper but its not technically money yet). It only has the power to "coin money". Which is why for the longest time, the Treasury minted silver &amp; gold dollars.
  
To get around that inconvenience, the Fed was created, and is *NOT* a government entity and does *NOT* issue DOLLARS. It issues IOUs/Notes for dollars, which are traded "as if" they are actual dollars.
  
To illustrate this, if Warren Buffet gave you a check for $20, and you went to the store and said I don't have any cash on me but I'll endorse you this $20 check from Warren Buffet, you've now bought something with an IOU. Now the Fed notes are backed by the full faith &amp; credit of the US Govt so they're worth "as much" as a dollar, whatever an actual dollar may be.
  
If you're thoroughly confused, don't worry, that was the point of the whole system. Just remember that the paper money in your wallet are not dollars, it's a promise to pay dollars (of which doesn't exist), but that money doesn't actually exist except in the form of worthless (metal content) coins.

if you ever moved and they sent you a refund check for a cancelled insurance policy for example, and you never received it or say got it and lost it and never cashed it, and they weren't able to track your new location, then the insurance company has to turn it over to the state. Same with many other financial businesses - unearned revenue like cancelled premiums, federal and state tax refunds cannot be kept by the company/govt as income. Each state maintains an abandoned property database that you can search 
After a very long time, then the state claims the money. Same thing is someone dies without any heirs, it goes to the state to hold, and eventually claim.
This is a good thing, for say if someone dies and the family is unaware of it, then it goes into the state database.  The family would see it on the database and be able to claim it.

Cash based businesses are audited the highest. Cash tip employees too. Restaurants, bars, service employees (like barbers etc).
    
The point is, this is is nothing new. This law has been on the books pre-9/11 (since 1970). The way she deposited it threw up flags. If she deposited amounts just under $10k to avoid the reporting, technically she broke the law.
  
The main problem is that the $10k was originally enacted in 1970 and not adjusted to inflation. $10,000 in 1970 would be $61,000 in today's dollars.  So while in 1970 you would have to deposit over $61,000 worth of today's currency in cash - that would be a highly suspicious activity done on a regular basis - in today's society selling a 5 year old used car in cash would trigger the same reporting requirement. And a restaurant would do so on a regular basis - say a monday deposit after a busy weekend.

yes bitcoin is great but it's currently NOT a USD replacement.

You know, the good and bad of a big company accepting bitcoin for transaction processing. 
Good: awareness and credibility for bitcoin
  
Bad: in the short term it actually drives market prices down. people sitting on a pile of coins buys a Dell, Dell dumps it for dollars, supply increases and prices fall. Most people are not going to go to coinbase to buy coins, wait a week for the coins, then use it to buy a dell. The coins are coming from stashes
  
However, in the long run, as more companies accept bitcoins then it may increase prices, as small merchants and individuals who accept bitcoins have more options to spend it than use gyft or other cashing out, so may hold money in btc rather than convert immediately to dollars.

Yes and no. The Treasury issues Bonds. The Bonds pay interest. The Fed buys the bonds and use the bonds as collateral to issue notes (dollars) who gives the Notes back to the Treasury. Now the Treasury has dollars. It's a bit ridiculous, Treasury gives to Fed who gives back a little less to the Treasury.
  
So when the US inflates, for example, $1, it only receives say .97 of that dollar in Notes, and the Fed keeps the interest. The Fed is *NOT owned by the public, but is owned by its stockholders, which are major banks. So when we inflate our currency, we not only devalue our currency, we pay interest to the Fed who is supposed to give the money back to the Treasury, however, no individual or agency has the power to audit the Fed.

What's strange is that the 750k 'stolen' werent stolen like a traditional hack. Gox GAVE them to people issuing fraudulent tickets with tampered txids. But how could a company give away bitcoins into insolvency without noticing a 750k deficit?
This shows that Gox at heart, was a small business. It was still the same business that was trading magic the gathering cards - even though financially it grew to a billion dollar powerhouse - the transactional systems, accounting systems  - never grew. Whereas a Coinbase, for example, started by venture capitalists, started with a financial company in mind - knowing that just 1 breach can kill a company. Unlike with digital USD - funds can be traced down and frozen by regulators - bitcoins cannot.

i knew it wouldn't last, but thats how coinbase crushed gox and any other competitor, even localbitcoins. INSTANT coins! Remember having to wait 2-3 weeks and standing in line at the bank sending a wire to Gox? Then gox say a month later they never got it? No more...
now they're (coinbase) hitting your account THE VERY NEXT DAY (they never did that before) but you have to wait 4 business days for your money. Now YOU are giving THEM 3 day interest-free loans.

You buy coins on gox. gox tell you that YOU have 1 bitcoin in your account on THEIR site. You haven't seen the private key. How do you KNOW that they have assigned a physical bitcoin to you, or if your 'bitcoin' is just an I-owe-you posted against their bitcoin pool. You don't know whats behind their bitcoin safety deposit box. Same as a bank. You only KNOW they have it when you demand it (so the teller goes and grabs some cash out the register) and gox grabs a bitcoin from their pool. Obviously they dont practice fractional reserve but what if people start carrying balances on gox wallets, and some guy named Ben B who works at gox says i have a great idea, only about 10% of the bitcoin holders actually demand their bitcoins at any given time, lets only keep in our pool 10% of the actual bitcoins we need, and lend the rest out with interest. Now a fractional reserve system is born.

you can choose to buy an asic now and have low to modest roi or chance of no roi (depending on diff and btc price). it definitely wont roi in a month or two. but you will be mining. who knows, if these 28mm chips are delayed 6 mo to a year then difficulty may level off and you may make a decent profit over the year. or btc price may spike and your ROI will go up. If btc has more of these 30% spikes in value and difficulty levels off it could be quite profitable.
or you can choose to buy a pre-order for months or years in the future. we saw how well that worked out for avalon and BFL customers. about 10% of very early orders (like day1) got their miners and made a killing, about half will get a low to modest return after a year waiting (prob would have made more buying GPUS and running them for a year), and slightly less than half will end up losing money due to hardware being delivered after difficulty too high.
Who knows if anyone will deliver on time? Avalon was the darling of asics with their first 2 batches delivered on time, but quickly turned sour with batch 3 and the asic chips being heavily delayed. Cointerra looks promising but they're new to the bitcoin scene with no prior asic products

The point I was trying to make is for the "selfish mining" attack to work, the selfish miner has to disclose who they are, and the community can sanction that group, either officially or unofficially. 
Very few pools and groups control 20%, that group's reputation would be destroyed. 
I didn't mention this, but if it were a pool, a peaceful alternative would be for responsible bitcoiners to jump ship to another pool. That pool would quickly lose hash and the attack would be very costly and less efficient.
And for a group that owns 20% of their own hardware, why would they risk millions of dollars of earnings each month as they will most likely be retaliated against. Selfish Mining is a very offensive and deliberate attack, not a silent anonymous attack as is most common.
All these stories running around saying "The Bitcoin network can be hacked with as little as 25% hash" is nonsense and only works in a static environment with fixed variables and non-emotional players.

Bitcoins have utility by being able to transfer it, but the value of that utility is only worth what everyone thinks it is.
To prove the point, Worldcoin has the same features of Bitcoins - irreversibility, security, etc is much faster than Bitcoins yet is worth a fraction of a cent. Even accounting for the larger number of worldcoins, the market cap isn't nearly as much as Bitcoins.
Its all relative to mob psychology. If enough people "think" that Bitcoin is worth $100 then its worth $100. Or $20. Or $260. It becomes reality. And the guy who thinks its only worth $50 will accept that its $100 and probably sell and the guy who thinks its worth $200 will think its cheap and probably buy more, and it stays at $100 (or moves accordingly)

Yes thats right security is lagging behind technology. Some of the best benefits of bitcoins (ease of transfer internationally, like-cash transfers) are being twisted and becoming its greatest weaknesses. The Nigerian scam accounts for the 3rd largest GDP in Nigeria and thats conning people into WILLINGLY transferring money through the banking system. Bitcoin trumps this by allowing hackers to steal your money even if your computer is offline, wallet secured, etc. Just a simple keylogger from a stray click is all thats needed to rob you blind... for Bitcoin to go mainstream it has to be idiotproof! if you truly want Bitcoin to go mainstream and accepted everywhere it has to be near idiotproof security wise.

Google defines sale as:
1. the exchange of a commodity for money; the action of selling something.
Preorder: order (an item of merchandise) before it is available, with the understanding that it will be shipped later.
There has been no sale. Only a pre-order or pre-sale. Which implies the sale occurs when the item is shipped. There has been no exchange of goods, so the "all sales are final" doesn't apply. A pre-order is a contract for an exchange of goods for money. You paid the money, they have not fulfilled their end of the exchange. Until they do, they are in default. The FTC rule applies completely.

the problem is as a buyer it costs nothing extra for credit cards (seller pays the fees) and you get cashback or points, AND you get chargeback protection up to 180 days. The downside is ALL ON THE SELLER. So how can you convince a buyer its BETTER for him to use a bitcoin to buy a $2000 laptop versus using a Visa, getting 3% cashback, chargeback protection, price protection (in some cases), extended warranties for free, etc.
@_date: 2013-07-10 19:44:24
oh there will be incentives, its the transaction fees. the theory is that it asics will be so cheap per hash, and the network so large, that a small percentage of a big pie will be profitable. look at how many billions that VISA makes off 1.5% fees (the average cost of a physical swipe charge)
the problem exists though that due to efficiencies of scale that only a handful of companies will dominate the transaction fee market, hence, becoming a mostly centralized system.

the problem is the payment was sent as though you were a seller so paypal 95% of the time sides with the buyer. call it consumer protection. especially if nothing ships. the only time i've EVER won a case with paypal is blatent fraud (i.e. stolen accounts, cards, etc) or shipping to the confirmed address then it was charge back without returning the item.

Paypal knows its a disaster and they could be enablers of a public relations disaster. They don't want to be known as the payment processor that lost a bunch of people money. Just to put things in perspective, Paypal's market value is equal to the value of ALL bitcoins produced, 26 times over.
On another note, BFL is trying to mitigate losses (they are probably getting Gox'd with cashflow) so they are bumping chargebacks to the front of the queue so they can "save" that money.
Sucks to have paid in bitcoin on day 1 and have a 2-3 month later order jump you because they paid in Paypal... because bitcoin is better than Paypal right? I've always said its better to get PAID in bitcoin but its always better to PAY in paypal/credit card until we get escrows/reversals set up. Bitcoin has a 3rd party reversal system in the spec where an independent 3rd party can reverse the payment if something isn't delivered. I think this needs to be implemented for ecommerce else ecommerce will fail like in this instance. YOU CANT ALWAYS TRUST THE SELLER!

bitcoin has been acknowledged by the devs as an EXPERIMENT, albeit a successful one. you should not put your life savings in BTC. there are numerous critical flaws that could take down or crush the value BTC: a successful 51% attack, one miner or pool getting 30% hash rate (you have a small chance of succeeding in a 51% attack with 30% hash), govt meddling. or even a massive selloff by hoarders/early adopters (the top 1% could crash the value of btc).
you can pay your taxes in fiat, you can pay your mortgage in fiat. even though dollars deflate your mortgage payment doesnt deflate, its denominated in fixed deflating dollars.

Notice they used civil forfeiture to seize the bitcoins. Proof of guilt of any parties is not required for seizure. There was a good article on reddit about the increasing use/abuse of civil forfeiture i.e. essentially they are sueing the bitcoins themselves and are not afforded the usual due process since bitcoins dont have rights. 
So what that means is anyone who had ANY bitcoins deposited on SR, whether or not you had ever conducted a transaction or broken any laws, have your bitcoins forfeited because it 'could' have been used for illicit purposes.
Also they most certainly have full and exclusive access to the bitcoins... they even mention having authorization to query each wallet for the balance and drain each wallet to a wallet file they control.

call back, just be polite and after you go around the first circle insist on escalating it to a supervisor. its likely she cant do anything without authorization. once you get a SUP explain the situation and he will tell you they will open a case and it will auto close immediately. you will then have to call back and get a SUP again and appeal.
banks can be difficult. some only let you charge back electronic deposits within 30 days, and only if "not authorized". they're mainly worried about fraud, not about civil complaints. BFL didn't commit criminal fraud because they shipped at least 1 product and seem to have the intention of actually shipping something eventually. so its a civil case.
always, always, always fund with a credit card for pre-orders and other high risk items. even if you have a paypal balance, paypal wont let you choose a credit card. start a withdrawal then u can immediately go back adn choose pay by credit card.

Slow inflation is a good thing as long as wages and/or population go up. I'd rather pay off my mortgage in deflating dollars than inflating bitcoins. 
Could you imagine if you had gotten a mortgage denominated in bitcoins in January 2013?
High deflation can be bad. Land is inheritantly deflationary. Look at feudal England, where the wealthy had all the land and hoard it. Early land owners had all the advantage and commoners could not get ahead. If slow inflation keeps up with population growth, purchasing power actually stays neutral. 10 people have 10 dollars. 1 extra dollar is printed (inflation) but one person is born, 11 people have 11 dollars. Each person still has a dollar even though the money supply has expanded. This week we see bitcoins rallying now because population of buyers have grown but supply hasn't grown fast enough.

the point of the piece was not to rely on the math and say "the math is unbreakable, its 100% secure".
bitcoin is not math. the implementation is in code and ALL CODE HAS VULNERABILITIES (except maybe Hello World).
We saw that in the android bug, and in other online wallets. Not-so-random number generators. We see it every day in phishing attacks. We see it in brainwallet heists. We see it in keyloggers.
The point of the article was not to sit with your head in the sand saying "the math is secure".
If the NSA has a hand in a flawed RNG, or other bit of code thats incorporated into software, thats a vulnerability.
There also was an article saying that the NSA has had its hand in Microsoft CryptoAPI (can we doubt that?) and even OpenSSL. If any clients or bitcoin software, or bitcoin websites rely on any compromised API then its compromised. 
So just be aware and look for the choke points in the software...

when it goes public we'll see another huge spike. the only reason it hit $260 was because of intense media coverage and newbies mob buying to get into bitcoin.
also dont forget you cant invest in bitcoin with your IRA (or its very impractical). when its an etf it will be a piece of cake using your IRA money. And there's a LOT of money in IRAs.
Bitcoin suffers from a huge lack of liquidity, as much as some people are against the ETF it will provide a lot of liquidity. If someone wants to sell a million worth of bitcoins the price drops $20 whereas if someone sells a million worth of Apple it drops maybe a couple cents. You will not find a stock on the NYSE or Nasdaq worth $100 with a Billion dollar market cap that takes as takes as hard of a jump or dive as bitcoin when a big sale is made.

Credit cards are layers of hacks upon hacks but whats crazy is it works. We don't see all the behind-the-scenes stuff. You can charge your card, merchant can get approval, and seconds later show up on your online account. The amount of volume transacted through credit cards are staggering.
Bitcoin still needs a lot of work to scale. It needs improvements or layers upon layers of services to bring the same level of service. I can't imagine going to a store and waiting 40 minutes to buy a product. Bitstamp and others have bridge that gap slightly but thats just an example

ebay is about 3-4% for big laptops, paypal another 3%. ebay is marketing, has nothing to do with bitcoin commerce. for example, you can sell on ebay and ask to be paid in bitcoins.
the point is, on the internet its 'buyer beware'. you dont go around sending BTC to any site that pops up. we've been lucky so far because most btc transactions are within forums where people have reputations. but there are so many scammers and scam sites that i wouldn't go to a new site and have trust in a seller. there needs to be a trust system built into btc to convince buyers to use a non-recourse system. maybe ecommerce isnt btc's strong suit right now. now if you want to send money securely anywhere in the world, thats a strong suit.
You HAVE to have dispute resolution. Bitmit is a good example of it with the escrow system.

what they should do is have a "registered" address that you can only send instant payments to. they have everything on you so can require your SSN or other personal info to change the registered address, and a seasoning period of say 12 hours.
Just like in paypal you cant go in and change or add a bank account without matching some other private info, so a paypal hacker is limited in what they can do (essentially they can send to another paypal account which is still in paypal's system).
any other payment addresses other than you 'registered address' requires a seasoning period and an email/text confirming it, that way the owner has a chance of stopping it.
it would require the hacker to compromise BOTH the coinbase account AND the wallet password itself which is more difficult.

for bitcoin to become mainstream there HAS to be a way to idiot proof it. look at online credit cards. in the late 90's when "online shopping" came out, people were paranoid to order online by credit card. you dont know how many "i am NOT giving you my credit card number on a website" phone calls I used to get. the industry adapted, adding cvv2 numbers and essentially guaranteeing all customers 'no risk' chargebacks if their card is stolen. and on the back end beefed up anti fraud tremendously. now nobody is scared to use credit cards online. and fraud happens often online, but its usually shut down by the companies back ends quickly. whereas in the old days they could run up thousands of dollars on your card.
as much as bitcoiners hate middle men there has to be more service companies to handle these issues. after all, if its necessary to learn cryptography and computer security and other things JUST to participate in bitcoins, then it will always be a niche geeky market.
If you want grandma, grandpa, and the mainstream market who can't seem to keep dozens of spyware, trojans, and such off their computers, and whos computers crash regularly ... to pick up bitcoin mainstream, the system has to be pretty much idiot proof and fraud proof. credit card isn't cash but its based on cash. perhaps a credit system based off bitcoin for online transactions, one that can be recalled if fraud occurs. and thats settled in bitcoins on a monthly basis. 
just my .02.

unlike banks who can turn to the fed to print money, coinbase cannot sell coins they dont have. they obviously run some sort of slush account where they hold coins from sellers and use that to fund coins to buyers. and of course they match buy/sell orders in real time if there is sufficient volume.
what you dont want happening is them selling coins they dont own (virtual coins). then you essentially have what amounts to a fractional reserve system.
probably when the buy orders vastly outnumber the sell orders (and they run out of coins in their reserve account) they have to limit orders, as they may end up selling millions of coins to buyers as the market is going up and would be liable to purchase them at a higher price. by not committing on the price they are saying yes we'll sell you a coin at whatever we buy them at in a couple days.

paypal is a layer built upon CASH (us dollar). bitcoin is at the currency layer, there is a desperate need in the future for similar layers of services that protect the consumer.
if you had mailed BFL CASH you'd be in the same boat as sending BTC.
the only barrier to this is cash requires an intermediary to be sent electronically whereas BTC has this feature built in and does not require a paypal-like service to function online

READ ABOUT CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE. The FBI sued the bitcoins directly not the owners of the bitcoins. Civil asset forfeiture has nearly no burden of proof requirement.
from the article:
In general, you needn’t be found guilty to have your assets claimed by law enforcement; in some states, suspicion on a par with “probable cause” is sufficient. Nor must you be charged with a crime, or even be accused of one. Unlike criminal forfeiture, which requires that a person be convicted of an offense before his or her property is confiscated, civil forfeiture amounts to a lawsuit filed directly against a possession, regardless of its owner’s guilt or innocence.
One result is the rise of improbable case names such as United States v. One Pearl Necklace and United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins. (Jennifer Boatright and Ron Henderson’s forfeiture was slugged State of Texas v. $6,037.) “The protections our Constitution usually affords are out the window,” Louis Rulli, a clinical law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a leading forfeiture expert, observes. A piece of property does not share the rights of a person. There’s no right to an attorney and, in most states, no presumption of innocence. Owners who wish to contest often find that the cost of hiring a lawyer far exceeds the value of their seized goods. Washington, D.C., charges up to twenty-five hundred dollars simply for the right to challenge a police seizure in court, which can take months or even years to resolve.

BTC has a market cap of ~ 2 Billion, hardly enough to pay just the FINES on the tax evasion... If you have a couple hundred million or couple billion to stash, you could not hide it in BTC because the supply of coins would dry up and price would spike.

good luck. even private property isn't private property. governments call it eminent domain. and in many places, private property is taxed (cars, houses) - see if you really own it when you don't pay your taxes.
if you're paying a fee to anyone to keep or use your item, you're renting it not owning it.

depends on what you selected when you filed the claim. it asks you why you are filing it. certain categories are not eligible. select item not received next time.
Chargebacks arent against their TOS. I've been told by Paypal agents to initiate a chargeback in cases where it was &gt;45 days because they couldn't do anything on their end.  They are prohibited from retaliating against you for CC chargebacks (not like the old days) because VISA/MC cracked down on them a few years ago in order to keep accepting VISA/MC.
CC allows up to 180 days - you should always use CC in highly questionable transactions.
As for the 30 day rule read it yourself
They need to provide an updated shipping date and ask for your implied consent. Dell used to annoy me because they kept sending these reminder emails to log in and accept a delay when they were backordered. If the shipping date is missed they need to have affirmative consent of each new delay. BFL has not complied with the 30 day rule. It says silence is not consent - in the case of silence they must issue you a full refund.

If the fed ever did get 600k btc and liquidated it, it would send btc prices back to $30. anyone ever think of the fact that he took 600k btc out of circulation while creating a large demand is largely responsible for the rise to $130+

The MATH is SECURE. But as we saw with the android flaw, blockchain and other flaws, the software implementation is where vulnerabilities may lie. They won't break the math, they'll break the code. That's how most hacking is done anyways, going after software vulnerabilities - stack overflows, SQL injections, etc. Rarely do hackers gain access by brute forcing a very good password.
The NSA article specifically says that OpenSSL and Microsoft CryptAPI is very likely to have a NSA backdoor.
I think Windows Bitcoin-qt uses CryptAPI random number generator and the linux version uses OpenSSL.
So... does that leave us with an Android-style backdoor for the NSA? You tell me I'm just offering the idea...
The moral of the story is don't hide behind "the math is unbreakable, bitcoin is completely secure". As long as bitcoin exists in code and is not just a theoretical idea, we need to be vigilant for the flaws that already exist right now.

what if Satoshi wasn't really a genius at crypto at all, but he was a genius at physics - in the year 2040 there are no more BTCs created so he invented a time machine and decided to take one of those ancient asic usbs that are worth zero in the future,take it back into the past, 'invent' BTC (by of course copying archived original source code) so he can mine with his USB asic. And leave it running until the year 2040 where he will cash out all those incredible wallets!
That's obviously the most plausible...

for a real merchant service you need a processor essentially a middleman like visa/mc that takes the very small risk that a transaction won't be mined but guarantees it anyways. also figure that its not always 10 minutes could you imagine trying to buy something and your transaction gets stuck in limbo for 10 hours?
its one thing 2 people face-to-face but to operate a business you need transactions within seconds and the best way is to go off-chain or on-chain with 0 confirms and a company guaranteeing it.
bitpay and coinbase essentially do that to a point

don't feel bad if you have to inspect the money. really, i once met supposedly 1 buyer at a grocery store coffee shop and 3 guys rolled up with color-copy money trying to buy my $1200 macbook pro. it sort of looked real but it didnt FEEL real. too glossy not fabric enough. so i looked at it closer then i was like here hold this, grabbed the macbook, and said "i think your money is fake" and hi-tailed it out of there while my hand was in my pocket gripping a cold steel spartan. i really don't know what would have happened if it were not a public place or if i hadnt really hi-tailed it out of there.
likewise on the cash buyers side make sure you see the bitcoins in his phone/laptop wallet before handing over the cash

they want people to sell it and confirm agreement to their no refunds policy, so the new buyer cannot claim a refund when "2 more week" turns into 2014.
and the more people sell their spot to an unsuspecting buyer the fewer will be flaming BFL and fighting for chargebacks.
good move for them but it shows they have no plans on filling all their orders in the short term (else why sell your spot in line if it will be ready in "2 more weeks")
---- Also the 'new' buyer's only recourse is to charge back their payment to the 'first' buyer, or if they paid in cash or btc theres no recourse. the original buyer will be out of the loop and have no legal action or reason to fight with BFL.

They don't have the method of dealing with "item significantly not as described" cases for bitcoins. They are probably trying to figure out the best way to verify either side as a third party.
You need to be careful selling loaded coins as any buyer could take the coins and file an item not as described case saying there were no bitcoins on it and would win.
If you sold it as unloaded and put in the description and title no bitcoins included just the physical coin then it wouldnt get banned

Fantastic... so every one of my transactions done yesterday AFTERNOON hit my bank THIS MORNING but they are still pending until FRIDAY.
Great job coinbase. Now instead of having a 1-2 day float I have to prepay for my coins 3 days before I receive them.
Its definitely not just a security thing, its a cash flow thing. They're gaining positive cash flow by getting loans from its members. If it were a security thing they would allow 1-2 day purchases not 4 day purchases.

learn how US cash smells. it actually kind of stinks due to the ink. and the way it feels. 
they also dont stick together like fake money
if you want to bother with a jewelers loupe you can get a 20x and read the microprinting. theres tons of microprinting and pretty much no off-the-shelf or even high end office printer can print decent microprinting. if you have sharp eyes once you learn where to look you can even pick off some microprinting with bare eyes.
the pens arent reliable. if it fails its definitely fake but you can get a false positive - it just detects starch.

thats exactly what happened last week when the price on bitstamp crashed from $125 to $115 and sat there for about 5 minutes and coinbase tracked it perfectly, then it shot back up to $125.
