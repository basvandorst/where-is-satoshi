Hmm, what if you have players with different chipstack sizes? I would say the escrow for each player should be the sum of the chipstacks of all other players.

@_date: 2016-04-04 07:42:59
Actually now that I think about it, I think you can get away with each person escrowing only their own chipstack size; the escrow pool is collected together so if there's a dispute you can always use that entire pool to distribute according to the correct outcome.
Edit: aah, that's only if in the event of a dispute you can figure out what the result would have been. If you can't do that, then sure, I think you would need the higher deposit size in order to make not showing up always unprofitable.

You _do_ realize that a large portion of the smart contracts used by centralized or decentralized dark markets are just multisig escrows, and so all the bitcoin dark markets "impose" that computation on your computer too, right? Also, if you don't want to run code you don't like, use a light client; sharding will make it even easier as you can selectively participate or not participate in entire shards.

Merklized abstract syntax trees. Essentially, if the condition for spending a bitcoin UTXO comes in the form of a complex formula (eg. A OR B AND C OR D), then the formula is stored in a Merkle tree format and when you spend the UTXO you only need to provide the branches of the tree that you're proving (eg. if you're spending because B and C are true, then you would only provide that branch of the script, and the network never needs to see the A or D branches).

It's also damn hard to come up with an algorithm that's centralization resistant. I led the effort to develop Ethash personally and even I will not certify that it will be ASIC-resistant long term with more than 50% probability, if the market cap of ether reaches that of bitcoin and we abandon plans to switch to PoS. Though given that ether is smaller and we are keeping with PoW only for ~1.5 years, I think it's effectively serving its purpose at keeping the mining ecosystem reasonably decentralized and GPU-dominated for the time being.

Right, so we scaled that plan down because we could not figure out how to do the economics around coordinating gas price decreases; instead, we have a few precompiled functions for ecrecover, sha256, etc, defined in the protocol; that's what that python file shows.

I've tried Bitcoin many times in in-person retail contexts, and my impression is quite different. If you have a bad internet connection, it's entirely possible to spend minutes trying to get a transaction over, and quite often I've had problems where a transaction would take half an hour (if not longer) to confirm because it immediately followed another transaction which somehow ended up being non-standard. QR code scanning also often takes 10x longer than swiping or tapping a credit card. Online it works quite well though.

Actually, in this particular case, the _current_ protocol (1 MB limit) is actually a _soft fork_ from the new protocol (20 MB limit), so if we adopted the 20 MB limit miners definitely could (and in fact, automatically would by default simply by not downloading the 20 MB software package) soft-fork it right back to 1 MB and we would be stuck with it. If miners want to decrease the block size limit, they can, and they can force the cap on others; the only way around this problem I think involves cryptographic exotica like timelock puzzles.

If you recall I actually started in 2011-2013 with substantially different premises to what I have now; my ideas that, eg. proof of stake is superior, a diverse ecosystem of many cryptocurrencies+blockchains is the way forward, fixed-supply currencies will not achieve mainstream retail adoption, etc did not arise out of a vacuum. They arose in part out of years of experience and thinking, and in part out of eventually extending my intellectual horizons beyond Mises and Rothbard (ie. "listening to what people say and writing articles based on my own progression through the thinking"). And Tim similarly did not start out as a critic in the same way he is now.

What specific distortion are you positing?

The paper also includes the claim that any malfeasance is cryptographically provable. In that case, you could have a security deposit that would be taken away upon proof of malfeasance, so that part is in fact sorted provided that their claims are correct. That said, I haven't yet fully wrapped my head around how this scheme deals with data unavailability attacks, as those tend to be harder to prove since until the data is published they are indistinguishable from a really really bad networking delay.

This is actually false. The relevant trick is a variant on sidechains (not my idea, I think it was Adam Back or Greg Maxwell): have a special address that corresponds to an additional "extra UTXO database", such that sending to "TRUE OR F" adds a UTXO to the database with condition F, and then make a protocol change that a transaction can spend outputs from this database (and thereby bring them back into the "main database") only if they have not yet been spent. Transactions could happen inside of the extra database and from the point of view of nodes following the old protocol would not be seen at all, but would need to be merkle-hashed into the coinbase output in some fashion. This strictly reduces the set of possible valid transactions, so it's "only" a soft-fork, but it allows for people to send transactions to each other inside this extra database of arbitrary size.
Now, I happen to think that this soft fork vs hard fork wrangling is missing the point; the risk of a change is proportional to complexity much more than it is to which of those two categories it fits into and so in a sane world I would say just up the limit (though we certainly should have a more elegant formula than 20 MB; I prefer "1000-block exponential moving average * 2"), but this is a way of doing it softly if you really care that much about that.

That's presumably left as a coin-specific parameter. Crowdsale, sharedrop (ie. copy other coins' distributions) and managed N-per-person are all good IMO.


As much as I advocate replacing "wasteful mining" with "decentralized easy-breezy verifying" personally, that is NOT what is going to solve scalability. What will solve scalability is a system that works without requiring any node to process all transactions. Democoin tries to achieve that by random-sampling validators, so every transaction needs to be processed by only perhaps 100 randomly selected nodes. It's not nearly as advanced as some of the other designs that have been developed inside the cryptocurrency community, but IMO it has taken a lot of steps in the right direction.

So, cryptocurrency has two parts to it:

2. The technology (politically decentralized replicated state machine)
Pretty much none of the seasoned economists have endorsed (1). As far as (2) goes, you need a combination of economic and technical talent to judge that, but if you're promoting that position exclusively then you're in the "bitcoin meh, blockchain cool" camp in any case.

It's obvious that theoretically Bitcoin can be as scalable as Paypal or Mastercard; in the limit, full nodes process thousands of transactions per second, maintain terabytes of data, but are so expensive to run that only Coinbase, Bitpay and blockchain.info bother to do it and we basically have a copy of Paypal with a bit more cryptography involved.

The problem with assassination markets is basically that assassinations on people who "actually deserve them" are a public good, since modern evil generally operates by harming very many people very slightly (eg. by lobbying for burdensome regulations on a multitude of small competitors, polluting the environment, etc) in order to benefit a concentrated special interest, but assassinations on the good guys who stand up to such evil are a private good - if you raise your head the concentrated interest can just off you.
Political bribery markets are similar, but less extreme: instead of assassinating people, you are paying for a government to either look the other way on lighter negative externalities or inflict negative externalities themselves by stacking up regulations. So I expect the economics to be roughly the same.

That was a good argument back in 2009 or 2011, back when new currencies actually could benefit from obscurity for a few months to give their creators a chance to stock up, but that's not how things work now. Protoshares actually thought the same way you did, hoping to mine their own coin. But they saw the entire community quickly jump on in the first 24 hours, overwhelming their difficulty adjustment algorithm and leaving them with nothing. Now they're releasing Angel shares. We don't need 30000 btc; we can make a great platform with 1000 btc even at current prices. But the fact is that there is a large chance people will want to buy in at a much greater scale, and I would rather see those funds go to help support the ecosystem and the cryptocurrency research group than just turn into waste heat through mining or get donated to extremely wealthy early BTC holders through deflation (ie. proof of burn).

I'd recommend you take a look into altcoins and cryptocurrency 2.0 tech specifically. Many of us here are interested in trying to use the consensus technology, and the concept of cryptocurrencies in general, in a much wider scope than just one single currency with 21 million units. The idea of creating a decentralized protocol and monetizing it via an internal token system provides for a revenue mechanism that is potentially very powerful, since the profit comes from a sort of emergent value out of nowhere as the value of the assets goes up and does not rely on any specific individuals paying you with money or by giving up their data privacy. It's perfect for many classes of public goods. Decentralized name registration lets us get rid of crappy certificate authorities, and decentralized contract systems allow you to create provably trustworthy applications that run in the cloud without requiring any explicit maintennance effort.
The example I like to give is gambling; it works nicely because it's a "pure" financial service and is thus very well poised to take advantage of the efficiency gains involved. In 2006, a gambling site required a lot of server infrastructrure, a website, a merchant account, etc to set up and required a lot of custom coding, and the market was bad for consumers because it was very easy for operators to cheat. In 2012, we have SatoshiDice, which uses Bitcoin and thus removes all the complexity from payments, and uses the blockchain as a database,  although it does still keep the requirement to maintain a website as a frontend and a serve to send transactions. It benefits consumers via its incredibly low rake and provably fair gambling, an algorithm by which customers can be mathematically assured that SatoshiDice is not cheating because the secret keys to the random number generator are published at the end of each day. Now, in 2014, we'll have contracts to do gambling on the blockchain. No upkeep requirement at all, and now the system can't cheat even if it was willing to take the money and run on a certain day; the bets are automatically processed, enforced and paid out by the blockchain. 
You can also do a lot of experimentation with currencies themselves; Auroracoin and the like are my favorites so far, and I think we'll see more coins organized around specific communities. On the [Ethereum forums]( I was recently involved in a discussion on how to implement Keynesian NGDP targeting in a cryptocurrency. That's the beauty of these platforms: they're fully generic architectures that can be used to implement anything. It's not an ideology, so much as every ideology. This is what I think we should be excited about, not the question of whether Bitcoin will jump down by 10x, up by 10x or up by 1000x.
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:32:41
Except that the quantity of units of a currency has no connection to the quantity if mining resources competing for it. It's entirely possible for a thousand forks of bitcoin to flourish; the only difference is that they would be less secure. PoS works in exactly the same way; the security of a PoS coin is proportional to the level of economic input into it. The idea that the wasted energy of PoW somehow magically flows into a coin and gives it a guaranteed status is in pretty much all cases economically invalid.
@_date: 2014-09-27 23:26:46
Well, actually, that's not fully correct either. It's true against external threats, but in the face of internal threats (ie. GHash) the measure of strength is not hashpower, but level of decentralization. Bitcoin fares pretty poorly in that regard, as do most alts, but not all; eg. some of the proof of stake ones hold out pretty decently.
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:31:05
So, Counterparty sucks because it is too powerful?
I was involved in the colored coins project for a few months before I moved to my position that MSC/XCP-style systems are strictly superior to CC in basically every possible way (and moved to Ethereum full-time, but I will say that Ethereum is _not_ superior to CC in every possible way because it is not directly based on Bitcoin so doesn't have as nice interoperability properties, though with cross-chain SPV proofs you can get halfway there (and the independent blockchain approach has other benefits, like faster block times, no risk of LukeJr censoring you and the eventual goal of proof of stake; you weigh the costs and benefits)). But I spent enough time in colored coins to understand the dynamics involved here.
Colored coins supports a protocol called p2ptrade, which allows two users to exchange colored coin asset A for colored coin asset B via a trust-free atomic swap. The problem is, while this is awesome for OTC trading, this _cannot_ be extended into a complete decentralized exchange because orders are not enforceable, so you need a mechanism to filter out spam attacks.
However, for people working on colored coins this is not a disadvantage; in fact, is it a key advantage of colored coins for one simple reason: you can monetize it! Pretty much all colored coins businesses, including one that I personally was presenting to VCs back in November before I moved away from the space, have as their primary revenue model taking transaction fees from every trade happening through their centralized (albeit trust-free) exchange. Counterparty, on the other hand, removes the need for such services in most cases (the only remaining use case is basically HFT) because there's a zero-fee (except bitcoin fees) decentralized exchange already baked right into the protocol.
Now to answer some concerns:


Same reason you pay $8.95 to buy a domain name; it's not an evil conspiracy, it's spam protection. If the price was $0.000895, squatters would have bought up all the domains and sold them back to you for the market price, which we might assume is something close to $8.95, except the difference would be pocketed by the squatters instead of a relatively decent public-goods-providing institution such as ICANN.


Eventually, wallets will abstract away all of the different platform tokens, and will give you the ability to save in whatever you think is the best investment (eg. some BTC, some kind of weird [SchellingUSD]( Overstock shares), and buy platform tokens as needed in real time. You'll just see "cost of registering an asset: $3.68. Accept / Reject?" and the wallet will do the conversions for you Ripple-style.


Yay! Let's require innovators wanting to build a basic stock exchange to come up with a fundamentally new two-way cross-chain two-way-pegging protocol, _and_ walk around asking permission from all major mining pools to adopt it!


Problem: for a decentralized exchange to work, orders must be enforceable, which means that _the protocol_ needs to have the ability to move currency units around without users' permission. This is basically the reason why Ethereum can't work off of Bitcoin (at least directly; one can do certain things with the aforementioned one-way cross-chain SPV proofs), and applies equally well to Counterparty.


Umm, you do realize that's a primary reason why BTC has gotten anywhere at all and why people like Roger Ver have spent timeless months evangelizing for Bitcoin and getting merchants to be the first guinea pigs to accept it far before its time? If Bitcoin did not have the incentivization aspect baked in, it may well have met the same fate as Diaspora.
In fact, I would argue that everyone saying "Bitcoin for everything is the way to go!" is suffering from the exact same "moral hazard" in the opposite direction.


Maybe. If so, I have no problem with it. People need money. Question is, is the approach that you are using to get money one that imposes otherwise unnecessary costs on the network, or not? I would argue that creating an asset is FAR less intrusive than charging monopolistic fees.


As politifact would say, Mostly False. Colored coins does work okay with SPV if you are dealing with a color which is relatively unused (eg. a few thousand transactions total since genesis), but for larger colors there is an exponential blowup problem where "proving" the color of each UTXO would require proving the color of its parents, then parents of all those parents, etc, all the way back to the genesis, at which point you've ended up processing a substantial portion of all UTXO that were ever connected with your color. So, SPV support works in some cases, but not nearly close enough to 100% of them for people to be able to rely on it. So in practice I would consider XCP and CC roughly equivalent in this regard.
Colored coins was an awesome idea, and I applaud everyone who worked on it from 2010-2013, but my personal opinion is that XCP-style meta-consensus systems are the next generation from here, at least as far as Bitcoin-based protocols are concerned.

Yes, that's exactly the definition of category 4 as I described.


Simplified payment verification. There is no equivalent of a "light client" for something like MSC or XCP; you need to literally process every single transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain one by one in order to securely determine any information about the current balance sheet.

The issue is that while UTXO bloat and transactions are correllated, they're not the same. For transactions-as-transactions, they're basically the same. Here, however, we're talking about using transactions as a data store. In that case, there's a choice between storing the data in such a way that it can then be removed from the UTXO, and storing the data in such a way that it can't be. There needs to be a clear mechanism for incentivizing the second choice.

Yes. I will personally almost certainly be a customer multiple times if this were to happen.

So the first point to keep in mind is that the two-way pegging requires either scripts to have state beyond binary spent/unspent, or scripts to be able to limit what kinds of outputs they spend to (which is basically a way to replicate the concept of state but moving the UTXO around), both features currently unavailable in Bitcoin.
The way the opcode basically would work is:
1. To claim 1 BTC from one of these lockbox scripts, an owner of sidecoins would need to destroy 1 sidecoin, and the destruction transaction would need to reference a specific UTXO in Bitcoin (otherwise, the same destroyed sidecoin could be used to claim BTC over and over again).
2. Then, the sidecoin owner would need to wait 100 blocks, and create an SPV proof consisting of (1) a Merkle tree proof that the sidecoin destruction happened, and (2) 100 blocks going back from that proof.
3. The sidecoin owner can submit the proof to the script, and the script will wait 24 hours before releasing the BTC.
4. Now, during that time, anyone else can submit an even longer SPV proof, and claim the BTC themselves. In this way, through a contest we prevent people from claiming BTC by destroying sidecoins on any chain other than the main chain.
(4) is critical; without (4) a mining pool can claim BTC by quietly mining 100 blocks off the main chain, and then using that to steal all the sidecoins. However, (4) is where contracts having state comes in.
Personally, I was looking forward to seeing them come up with a nice generalized way to add expressiveness to Bitcoin's scripting language that makes the sidechain verification script possible; so I'm actually a bit disappointed that OP\_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY is all they have. Having a single opcode to handle an _entire_ standardized process of verifying a sidechain has several disadvantages:
1. It prevents innovative Merkle tree structures (eg. the Patricia tree Ethereum relies on)
2. It hampers innovative blockchain structures (eg. Aviv Zohar's Ghost++ block-DAG models)
3. It hampers innovation in mining algorithms, eg. ASIC-resistant, IO-bound, proof of stake, useful PoW, etc.
4. It makes it difficult to make further improvements to the sidechain proof verification process itself
I would have preferred either of:
1. Something like Peter Todd's OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY plus an opcode that allows scripts to restrict who their outputs go to (note that this, plus some Y-combinator-like recursive magic, could probably be used to implement generalized scripting, except with the properties that (i) long-term scripts would not have a single position on the blockchain that they could be reliably accessed and (ii) scripts could not talk to each other), or
2. Create a generalized merged mining infrastructure, and have an opcode that uses that to grab the most recent block on any sidechain.

I'd argue sidechains will compete with each other too. I think a lot of people are blind to the economic realities of sidechains - namely, that if they are going to be actually developed, they are not going to be done at high quality out of altruism, they'll need a revenue model. In fact, the one empirical data point that we have as a non-Blockstream sidechain, Truthcoin, is funding themselves by having two currencies, sidechaining one and crowdselling the other. And when you have entities that are incentivized by seeing their own blockchain succeed, you have competition, and you have clashing incentives. So I could easily see a big sidechain paying miners to whack its competitors.

Actually, no it wouldn't. The protocol is decided by the protocol definition, not majority hashpower.

It's the same with 1000 BTC reward blocks. The only thing that hashpower decides is the order of transactions.

Theoretically, if you know that a party is expected to give more accurate information on an event than a random coin weighted by a prior known probability distribution, then it should always be possible to find a mechanism for determining the truth of that event involving that party that outperforms any mechanism that doesn't involve that party. It's just a matter of applying Bayesian math to determine how much to weight everyone (though if you limit yourself to M-of-N mechanisms where everyone has to have either 0 or 1 keys then your main point is correct).
Now, if parties select themselves, then in some circumstances you might want to refuse them, fearing that they might be exploiting your inaccurate knowledge of their level of trustworthiness. Otherwise though, from basic information theory more info should always outperform less.

It's interesting that originally ETH was actually conceived first as [an extension to Mastercoin]( then a separate metacoin on top of Primecoin (not Bitcoin, so as not to bloat the blockchain). However, as soon as coders better than myself joined the project, we made the decision to delay the release to make the protocol an independent blockchain, because I felt that metacoins were inherently a bad idea [due to light client incompatibility]( (yes, both those links are old Ethereum whitepapers from one year ago). And then we figured out how to knock the block time down to 12 seconds; aside from that it's interesting to see how the exact same year-old debate still applies. All I'll say is that it's definitely good for the sector to have all models exist in all implementations (metacoin, sidechain, independent coin, contract inside ethereum, contracts inside an ethereum-like metacoin), so we can see how the scalability plays out.
Also, you guys do have a new currency; you're just using XCP assets to fill that role :)

So, there is one other problem with merged mining - it doesn't _actually_ solve the every-node-processes-every-transactions problem. To see why, suppose two cases:
1. Chain A has 1000 tx/sec
2. Chains A-J each have 100 tx/sec
In case 1, miners of chain A will need to process 1000 tx/sec. In case 2, merge miners will need to keep track of all chains in order to merge-mine securely, so every merge miner will need to process 100 tx/sec from A, 100 tx/sec from B etc for a total of 1000 tx/sec.
The key to solving scalability is figuring how to allow a much larger number of users to _implicitly_ protect a blockchain without being _explicitly_ involved in processing every transaction. The two approaches that I know of to make that work are statistical protection (ie. jury selection for voting on block validity) and reactive protocols (ie. turning up the level of attention on specific substates when an attack is detected). Merge-mining _with only mining pools actually running full nodes_ is sort of a third approach, but I'm not comfortable with it  because it creates a much higher level of explicit centralization than I'd like.

Why is the 32GB SD card part of the second delta? It's something you need to have in order to be able to random-access UTXO to satisfy the mining algorithm. The only thing I see still being in the delta is a slightly more powerful CPU to validate ECDSA and a bit of extra network utilization, which IMO is pretty low. $100 to $50 may not do much, but $100 to $10 is a bit better.

There are two levels of hard-to-verify here. You can have an algorithm that is very hard to verify (eg. sha256^10000000) so pretty much no client can do it, but there are also lots of algorithms that are sufficiently easy to verify for clients to do it, but still too hard for a blockchain to verify them. Scrypt sits in this middle category, as does the current Ethereum mining algo. One possible path for improvement would be for the mining algo to involve doing some computation and submitting a hashtree computational stacktrace, padded with moderately difficult SHA3 for antispam, and use challenge-response protocols to allow light clients to verify individual steps.

One point that I think has not been raised enough is that the question of whether to use an M-of-N voting system or a blockchain for smart contracts actually parallels the question of whether to use a voting system or a blockchain for currency. If an M-of-N system is good enough for determining whether or not a contract was fulfilled, why isn't it good enough for determining the order of transactions? Why don't we get rid of this stupid electricity-wasting mining algorithm, and just have a voting algorithm of a few dozen servers decide what the balance sheet is?
As is turns out, there actually is such a system; it's called Ripple. So if this approach is the better way to do things, why not go all the way and use Ripple instead of Bitcoin? I really would like to see some more discussion of the pros and cons of M-of-N versus an economic-power-weighted blockchain approach.

Copying over a post I made in another thread because it seems relevant:


Transactions as proof of work. In order to send a transaction, you need to add a nonce that satisfies a work condition (could be 2^32, could be proportional to value, actually doesn't matter too much). Every transaction must reference the previous transaction. The chain of transactions with the highest total PoW is taken as truth. Blocks don't exist. There's a PoW-based consensus architecture with no currency whatsoever, using the desire to have one's transactions included in the chain as the participation incentive directly.
Now, on top of this we can layer a variation on the GHOST++ protocol from Aviv Zohar, which basically consists of allowing transactions (in his original algo blocks) to reference multiple parents, so the transaction chain becomes a directed acyclic graph. Transactions would be processed in some canonical order. That solves the problem that otherwise the whole thing would fall apart at more than about 1 tx per 2 seconds, since you can have transactions collate other transactions after the fact.
Now, we require transactions to report not only the previous transaction, but also the previous transaction that matched a higher difficulty threshold (eg. 16x, or 256x). This can be interpreted in one of two ways:
1. We're adding a skiplist into the blockchain to make it more light-client friendly
2. Every transaction has a certain chance of just randomly becoming the equivalent of a block
Now, we have properties basically equivalent to Bitcoin in many ways, except there is no block reward and no intrinsic/privileged currency. You can also make the PoW non-outsourceable (eg. have the PoW condition be on the s value of the signature, not on the hash, so you need the private key to do the PoW), and that to some extent forces a higher degree of decentralization as you basically force an economy where ASICs get added into every computer once it goes mainstream.

So you can look at that on two levels:
1. How good are PoW-based blockchains at providing decentralization?
2. Is decentralization a worthy goal in the first place?
Bitcoin has no serious non-blockchain-based competitors, so I think the answer to (1) is almost universally that it's the best approach possible. Opponents of Bitcoin generally attack it from the angle of (2), so it's the virtues of decentralization itself that require the greater amount of justification. And in that context, the high level of electricity usage is decidedly a con, although one can argue about how large a problem it actually is.

You can mine the chain in secret with less than 50% too. You just have a less than 100% chance of success. At 49%, for example, if you attempt a 51% attack and mine in secret you have a 78.7% chance of successfully overturning a 6-confirmation spend, and at 45% it's a 30% chance (meaning that you just need to try 3.33 times).

But you need the second PUF, or some other construction produced at the same time as the first PUF, to verify that the outputs of the first PUF are valid (unless you use a Merkle signing scheme, but then you might as well just use a flash drive).
Edit: you may be able to come up with something really clever involving [Merkle puzzles]( and [Feistel networks]( but you would only get quadratic attack complexity and the whole process would be really stupid. If you really care about physical unclonability, just use a [Merkle/Lamport signing scheme]( on a tamper-secured ROM with some random data. You would need to get a new device after every million queries or so, but whatever.

Heh. It's actually still a pretty major barrier in practice. I helped run the Bitcoin Magazine website for 2 years, and we quite frequently had outages that we needed to have some techie attend to. In the case of Ethereum, making sure our ether sale website was DDoS proof took thousands of dollars and months. Decentralization would probably have substantially mitigated both of those problems.


Hmm, I'm starting to see a common trend here. The primary argument that they raise for basing things on Bitcoin is to leverage its security. If Bitcoin proponents are correct in their estimation of the security of proof of work in the long term, then I can see this argument being correct. My view, on the other hand, is that (1) Bitcoin is running on borrowed time and PoW is going to get rather flimsy come 2032 or so, and (2) proof of stake provides better security against outsiders and lower fears and politics on the inside (eg. no GHash; in fact, I have a conjecture that our latest version of [Slasher Ghost]( encourages people to put their stake into decentralized stakepools if at all possible, as the objective is to minimize risk of a takeover attack, so it actually incentivizes the market to produce more decentralization over time). So perhaps that's going to be the arena in which this all plays out over time; Bitshares certainly thinks so.

Hey Peter,
I would like to sincerely thank you for your input; it was in large part thanks to your comments (and Sergio's analysis of Dagger) that we made the decision to have the PoW/PoS contest instead of going with an in-house invention of our own, and that I specifically added "agility" as one of our core principles. I am perfectly aware that I personally am missing entire classes of experience and specific domain knowledge that we will need to make Ethereum a worthy crypto 2.0 that actually fixes the problems that Bitcoin introduces; however, we are perfectly capable of finding people to fill in the gaps - that's what the fundraiser is for.
I think things are going to get much more interesting once we're done with the fundraiser preparation and development starts in earnest. I have been holding off on making changes to the language so far, because we have had no evidence to see whether or not changes are even necessary. We have a C++ client 90%+ done now, however, which allows us to embrace a very agile development methodology where we can use real world empirical tests to see where optimizations are possible or necessary and adjust the protocol specification as needed. I am confident that we'll have a much stronger platform when the fundraiser ends in two months.
I think that we should cooperate more, especially since as you say we are lucky enough to be in the same city.

Great step forward, but insufficient IMO. Now instead of trusting okcoin, we have to trust either okcoin or Stefan Thomas. I personally know Stefan Thomas and he's a nice guy and competent developer, but if you as a member of the public do not know me, Stefan Thomas or okcoin, then all you know is that a chinese exchange picked someone to audit them, and the auditor gave a green light. Whoop de doo; I'm sure Enron could have come up with someone like that as well. We need the proof-of-solvency mechanism to be public so that anyone can audit their portion, sort of like how [Peatio does]( and the auditing mechanism that customers are pointed to should be a standard public tool and not something provided by the exchange itself. It sounds from the article that okcoin is already taking a step in that direction, which is awesome, but it should be more accessible and appropriately compartmentalized.

BitUSD is dangerous IMO; the economics of the market peg mechanism are such that it works right up until the point at which it doesn't and everyone loses confidence in the system at the same time. Not black-swan friendly enough for my tastes. You also can't rely on current empirical evidence as proof that it works, because the market assumes that there exists a Fed (namely, BitShares Inc) to stabilize it if things go awry in either direction. And even for my own proposed/preferred stable currency schemes, I would not recommend them for mainstream use until they've seen at least a year of real-world use including a major market event.

True, you are right. But the fact that they spend the bulk of their time emphasizing "we're the trustworthy guys" rather than "there are ways to make everyone more trustworthy" is what makes me uneasy. In crypto it's only partially true that you must trust someone, and people defending bitcoin in front of regulators should make a very substantial effort to promote this point.

Some of the suggestions are good (I personally have advocated multiple times for someone to build a make-your-own-mining-pool utility similar to the tool that VPS providers use), but other parts feels a bit too moralistic and missing-the-point to me. Miners do not verify blocks locally for a reason: not having the hardware to do it costs $0, having the hardware to do it costs $100, therefore they do not do it. Altruism is something that you can rely on 1% of the population having, but it is definitely not something that you can rely on everyone having.
Additionally, there is a bit of a misconception behind the role of stupidity, short-sightedness and greed behind the choices of miners to stay with GHash. The fact is, what we are seeing is a standard tragedy-of-the-commons problem: there are N miners, each one gets 100% of the benefit of being lazy, but each one only pays an insignificant fraction of the cost. The fact is, if an individual miner with 500 GH/s chooses to "do the right thing", that has an absolutely negligible impact on centralization as a whole. Thus, "defecting" and using GHash is in a miner's long-term enlightened self-interest as well as in the short-term interest of laziness. If it was a concern about irrationality, then education could quite well fix it; in reality, however, it's a broken protocol, and individual miners are behaving perfectly rationally.

RushWallet is more secure than InstaWallet in two specific ways:
1. Funds are stored client side, not server-side.
2. The private key is stored in the URL after the hashtag. By HTTP standards, that part of the URL is not sent to the server when you make a request; it remains purely client-side, so the server never sees what any of the private keys are.
The basic mechanism has been used successfully in Satoshi Circle and other sites, so it's not at all a new invention.

Transactions as proof of work. In order to send a transaction, you need to add a nonce that satisfies a work condition (could be 2^32, could be proportional to value, actually doesn't matter too much). Every transaction must reference the previous transaction. The chain of transactions with the highest total PoW is taken as truth. Blocks don't exist. There's a PoW-based consensus architecture with no currency whatsoever, using the desire to have one's transactions included in the chain as the participation incentive directly.
Now, on top of this we can layer a variation on the GHOST++ protocol from Aviv Zohar, which basically consists of allowing transactions (in his original algo blocks) to reference multiple parents, so the transaction chain becomes a directed acyclic graph. Transactions would be processed in some canonical order. That solves the problem that otherwise the whole thing would fall apart at more than about 1 tx per 2 seconds, since you can have transactions collate other transactions after the fact.
Now, we require transactions to report not only the previous transaction, but also the previous transaction that matched a higher difficulty threshold (eg. 16x, or 256x). This can be interpreted in one of two ways:
1. We're adding a skiplist into the blockchain to make it more light-client friendly
2. Every transaction has a certain chance of just randomly becoming the equivalent of a block
Now, we have properties basically equivalent to Bitcoin in many ways, except there is no block reward and no intrinsic/privileged currency. You can also make the PoW non-outsourceable (eg. have the PoW condition be on the s value of the signature, not on the hash, so you need the private key to do the PoW), and that to some extent forces a higher degree of decentralization as you basically force an economy where ASICs get added into every computer once it goes mainstream.

As I understand it you can do addition and multiplication in SMPC using elementary SSS (addition is fully parallelizable and boring due to linearity, multiplication requires one not-too-difficult commutativity trick), and that's enough to give you the building blocks for an arbitrary circuit.

Well, if you put p2pool in a monopoly, then that collapses into the equivalent of Bitcoin mining itself but with a 10-second block time, which is problematic for other reasons (see [my arguments here]( What I advocate is more something like ten p2pools competing with each other. Maybe a binary tree of hierarchical p2pools on top of p2pools might be even better... hmm, that's actually pretty close to tree chains.

That's a technical problem, not a currency problem. The hard part of moving software and hardware onto Ethereum is figuring out how to implement Patricia trees and VM execution, not switching the currency ticker. The analogy to TCP/IP is completely off IMO; we're talking about whether or not to use the same currency, not whether or not to speak the same language. I think it's quite misleading to talk about those like they anything close to the same thing.
Also, merge-mining and currency-pegging are completely different and separable things, and it's important not to conflate them; you can have a merge-mined but not pegged currency (Namecoin), a pegged but not merge-mined currency (an ETH contract) or a pegged and merge-mined currency. I prefer not to merge-mine Ethereum because (1) I think ASICs make Bitcoin less secure, (2) because I do not want to be beholden to a few massive mining pools and (3) out of neutrality considerations.
Having 21 million units generated by cranking out useless SHA256 computations mostly in the scope of 2009-2013 as the end-all of cryptocurrency sounds like a very bad idea from an economic standpoint. The most interesting part of digital assets is how they provide for [innovative new incentive mechanisms]( and allow for different ecosystems to exist independently of each other, and you're basically advocating throwing that away. Having all cryptosystems use one currency makes about as much sense as the Japanese central bank suddenly saying that its currency is now going to be backed by the US dollar.

Suppose that (1), as I described above, does not apply, and you've set up an online voting system on top of Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever other platform. Then, in order to effectively censor the voting system, you need one of two strategies. First, all of the miners on the main platform (ie. 100%) support the censorship, and refuse to include transactions making certain votes into the blockchain. This requires 100% collusion. Second, the miners on the main platform can agree to double-spend every block that includes a particular transaction. This will work, with 50% collusion, but at a high cost; namely, you're severely disrupting the activity of an entire financial system (or even generic computation system), doubling confirmation times, all for the sake of one voting system. The inability of 50% collusion on a large-scale cryptocurrency network is already a core security assumption; if 50% start colluding, then we're all screwed anyway, and so miners are very strongly incentivized not to let such a situation happen. And if (1) applies and you're using a separate network, then of course 50% of voters can 51% attack the other 49%; that much I'm not disputing at all.
And we haven't even begun to talk about stealth addresses and commitment protocols, which would make any kind of information-targeted censorship impossible outright.

There is a fee per computational step, and if your contract can't pay the fee it stops. So yes, those limits do exist.
Also, Ethereum scripts can interact with the blockchain in very meaningful ways, that's their other advantage. To give a stupid but illustrative example, you can have a script that automatically pays money to the miner of a block if the parent block hash plus the nonce plus the balance of your ether address is less than 2^253.

Is that true though? Colored coins share bitcoin's platform network effects, but they are still separate currencies, so they don't really share the currency network effects. It sounds to be like your goal is indeed easy convertibility with BTC, in which case I would recommend colored coins or XCP, since jumping from a sidechain to BTC is substantially less efficient and will in many cases require a third-party cross-chain exchange operation since the default 1:1 peg conversion process is quite inefficient for small values.

I think even deflationists would agree that deflation that is so large that it lowers wages (at a faster rate than population growth) is unhealthy. A one-world fixed supply currency, in theory, would increase in value at exactly the same rate as GDP, and so assuming no structural changes and no changes in population people's wages within any given cohort would stay exactly the same (and each individual's wages would go up over time as they gain more experience).

You're oscillating back and forth between two positions: that you have a certain morality, including the claim that it is immoral to let people starve, and that your sole moral compass is the claim that the feelings of the local majority essentially determine morality. Which is it? You have to pick one. Either laws are just because they are set by society, in which case you have to answer for every single majoritarian atrocity that ever took place, or you have to justify laws on their individual merits.
It sounds like you prefer the latter approach; I do too. I personally don't see those laws as being reasonable; I see them as being part and parcel of the same culture of fear that has led the government to ban toothpaste from airplanes, chase whistleblowers, illegally spy on millions of Americans and enact an increasingly militaristic proto-police-state in an attempt to protect us from "threats" that add a smaller number of deaths per year than a leap year day's worth of cancer and heart disease. I don't see the government as an enlightened salon of philosopher kings; I see it as a very complex system of interacting human beings with different interests and incentives (ie. a market) which is just as susceptible to failure as the private market is. Regulatory agencies are dominated by people who understand the regulations well and are thus naturally inclined to think compliance is easy, with little room for empathy for the outside view which is often very different. It's exactly like upper middle class children telling homeless people to "just get a job". And that's only one of the more innocent examples of that particular system going wrong.

The problem with your ideology is that you, in pretty much the exact same fashion as your counterpart Murray Rothbard, try to completely whitewash away the distinction between the normative and the positive. The concept of "rights" is isomorphic to the concept of "should"; "I have the right to X" is synonymous with "others should not use force to deprive me of X". Your idea of rights is one that tries to fully subsume them into the realm of the positive; you argue that natural rights don't really exist in the physical world and the only way to define a right is that "I have a right to X" is equivalent to "society agrees to protect my claim to X". But all that does is it sidesteps the fundamental question: what should other people do? You are quietly slipping in the claim that people should obey the majority without ever defending it or even admitting that you are introducing it. You have "you should obey the masses" as a fundamental primitive; others have "you should respect people's natural rights". I see no reason why the former position is in any way less arbitrary or superior.

So, the spending of Bitcoin miners is guaranteed to be less than $400 per BTC * 3600 BTC per day = $1.44 million per day, or $400 million per year. Hence, electricity, cooling, renting data centers is all going to cost less than this amount, and it's an amount that's utterly trivial for any government or large corporation. $70 million is the approximate marginal cost of producing ASICs equal in amount to what we have now, and including shipping costs that might go up to $75 million or so. So, for an attack lasting a day, the net capital requirements are &lt;$76.44 million.
As for the "difficulty of centralizing electricity", that's missing the point to a large degree. What matters is NOT geographic centralization, what matters is political centralization. If the ASICs are spread out across 100 data centers and you control them all, that's still centralized. And there exist plenty of companies with the kind of geographically distributed data center infrastructure that we're talking about, and you can just use existing power lines.

@_date: 2014-05-23 23:52:35
So once we advance from "it's immoral for coin creators to earn a living" to "the issuance model should be widely accessible and distributed", there are some interesting arguments both ways. I agree with you that large pre-ownership is undesirable, for exactly the reasons that we just saw, and also out of public-choice-theory considerations (eg. I saw above that Jed wanted to give away most of the currency supply, but then when the team became more corporate that got pushed to the wayside even though it was not the original plan). Small pre-ownership is fine, especially if there is a coherent plan for distribution.
Pre-sales, on the other hand, David Johnston convinced me back in December are actually more moral than pure mining distribution, because they open up token issuance to multiple constituencies (one pool for people with money, one pool for people with hardware). Theoretically, a pre-owned endowment slice can help distribute things even further, if it is put into bounties for developers to improve the code, so you can also participate in the issuance with your talent if you do not have money or hardware, but if the endowment is the majority of the coin ownership it gets very unbalanced.
"Mining lets anyone get in", however, is an argument that I think deserves refutation. It certainly was true in 2010. Now, however, Bitcoin mining companies in China are very capable of pulling together hundreds of machines to mine even CPU coins, not to even mention the threat of ASICs. In the long term, I could see Intel and AMD simply mining everything in house. Individual users with laptops and desktops could get something, but the established mining community is likely getting &gt;50% of every coin.
I think the most important thing is to have a clear distribution plan in the first place. Ripple and Auroracoin were both heavily pre-owned, but Auroracoin was well-received because there was a clear plan for what would be done: 31 coins would be given to every Icelandic citizen. That's as far in the direction of "coin of the people" as you can get. If the Auroracoin team broke that promise, AC would either very clearly and quickly lose favor or be forked by a team that implemented it correctly. Ripple, on the other hand, never had a clear plan in the first place, except "we'll figure out how to give them away to a whole bunch of people, and by the way we'll accept funding from profit-seeking Silicon Valley venture capitalists", and so fell down in the face of public choice theory.

It is definitely possible to implement Bitcoin side chains inside of Ethereum contracts. Our general philosophy is to relegate all "currency experimentation" on the Ethereum platform, whether that's basic income coin, a SchellingCoin-based USD-tracking coin or BTC-pegged coin to contracts, and keep ether as ether; we feel this is the best simple approach to keep the system stable and minimize complexity risk and black swan risk. Having a Bitcoin side-chain inside an Ethereum contract can potentially be quite powerful; it allows you to very easily do decentralized exchange between bitcoin and ether (as well as other Ethereum assets) via the ETH -&gt; contract BTC sidechain -&gt; BTC pathway.

Here's what I think about this. The fact is, the Bitcoin Foundation is currently a heavily US-based organization, and even if Li Xiaolai became the new Vice Chairman it would still have over 50% (if not 80%) US representation. However, this may not be a bad thing. Canada has its own Bitcoin organization, Israel does, Germany does, etc, and yet the US seems to be strangely missing its own national legal entity. I think that the Bitcoin Foundation would be better off transitioning into a US Bitcoin Foundation, and stop even trying to be international, because the US really does need its own entity to do lobbying in Washington and the like. Then, we can have a global organization created, in such a way as to be decentralized, globally distributed and minimalistic from the start; the Global Bitcoin Alliance seems like a good blueprint at this point. That organization should then have the US be no more than 25%, and include involvement from Canada, Europe, Argentina, Israel and China.

Actually, MSC continues to have a very valuable proposition even in the face of sidechains and Ethereum: semi-decentralized exchange between BTC and fiat. Currently, the pathway for fiat to BTC conversion is something like:
banking system USD -&gt; bitstamp USD -&gt; bitstamp BTC -&gt; BTC
The second and third steps are problematic, because you need to trust Bitstamp, and as we know with MtGox exchanges really can't always be trusted. With colored coins, MSC or XCP, it becomes:
banking system USD -&gt; on-blockchain bitstamp USD -&gt; BTC
Where the last step is done with trust-free atomic swaps. This cuts down the trust by half - I would even say it cuts the trust down by 95%, since the vast majority of exchange thefts have been on the BTC side. This is something that sidechains and Ethereum have more difficulty doing, because you would need to replace the trust-free atomic swap with a trust-free cross-chain swap, which is harder.

"Premined" generally means "pre-genesis allocation". So sounds quite premined to me. Note that I am not opposed to premining (or altcoins for that matter), so this is not criticism; it's just better to use terminology in a way that matches the community's denotations and connotations for words.


So, most people define "altcoin" as "cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin". In that sense, unless one reddit note is 1-for-1 convertible with BTC, it is  an independent currency, and it sounds like it will be a cryptocurrency, hence it's an altcoin (unless it's not meant to be exchanged, and is meant only to be held as a claim on profits of something, in which case it's a _share_).
Your statement that you will use "colored coins or sidechains" strikes me as odd. Colored coins and sidechains are completely different technologies with different purposes. The purpose of colored coins is to allow you to use the Bitcoin blockchain for an application without using the Bitcoin currency. The purpose of sidechains is to allow you to use the Bitcoin currency but not the Bitcoin blockchain. Hence, the fact that both of these are viable options to you proves that (i) you do not need to be on Bitcoin the currency, and (ii) you do not need to be on Bitcoin the blockchain. I can't imagine an argument for why having _either_ the Bitcoin currency or the Bitcoin blockchain would be indispensable if neither of the two are indispensable in their own right, so it seems to be that a completely independent chain would also be a legitimate route. So can you enlighten me a bit further, what is the logic behind choosing your precise disjunction, and not settling on either colored coins/MSC/XCP, sidechains or admitting that anything is on the table?

Addresses in Bitcoin are made up of the base58 encoding of the hash160 of the public key together with checksum data and a "version byte". In normal addresses, the version byte is zero.
For an example, first let's get a hash160 by using "bob.\^.monkey.\^.123" as a brainwallet.
    &gt; pybtctool bin_sha256 "bob.^.monkey.^.123" | pybtctool -b privtopub | pybtctool -b hash160
    6180d4fc7738523fd08ada02cf608a6d403c6d46
Now, here's how you generate a Bitcoin address from that:
    &gt; pybtctool hex_to_b58check 6180d4fc7738523fd08ada02cf608a6d403c6d46 0
    19tYt1bXYuRawPwGnigFeMDWfAFpZ5aJDw
hex_to_b58check is a pretty involved algorithm; see [the code]( for how it works. But here's the fun part: if we just change the version byte to 48, we get:
    &gt; pybtctool hex_to_b58check 6180d4fc7738523fd08ada02cf608a6d403c6d46 48
    LU7W9DuMdZfeCCdRxrfYvNHGsNd6aTFgpz
A litecoin address! And:
    &gt; pybtctool hex_to_b58check 6180d4fc7738523fd08ada02cf608a6d403c6d46 30
    DE2eRGYArKKsUQ7sXJfpC7P7YHz7p9FV3m
Much currency. Very address. ~~(As a fun challenge, I sent 490 doge into that address. See if you can claim it)~~ edit: I accidentally misformed the address the first time I did this. The 490 doge are now in a black shibehole and I sent another 490 to the person who pointed this out.
As a protocol convention, all P2SH addresses (a technical classification that multisigs fall into) have a version byte of 5. Although this makes for a completely invalid address because P2SHs are not formed by taking the hash160 of a public key, let's see what happens if we:
    &gt; pybtctool hex_to_b58check 6180d4fc7738523fd08ada02cf608a6d403c6d46 5 
    3AaZoZ5y6ojy2ZdhupLr4yaSogYY5u4Lkq
The reason why it's always a 3 is because both addresses and hex are base systems, so the leading digits usually correspond in some way. For example, if you take any base 2 number of the form 111\*\*\*\*\*, you'll notice that the corresponding decimal is always of the form 2\*\*.

I agree with your position but have a different strategy. The two important components to having a secure brainwallet are:
1. Use a good KDF. Hash a thousand or a hundred thousand times, or use pbkdf2 or bcrypt. This adds 10-17 bits of security.  
2. Prepend your username to the password. This adds another 10-17 bits of security (because the attacker has to target every individual specifically and cannot simultaneously blanket sweep the namespace) at no extra memorization cost  
With (1) and (2) and standard "good password" techniques (eg. mixed case letters, numbers, symbols) you are basically fine. No need to use any crazy tricks that might lead to you forgetting your brainwallet. How fine? Well, take the number of times you hear about a brainwallet getting hacked, and divide it by a million (10 + 10 bits of security = 2^20 = 1048576, to take the lower bound; the higher bound is a factor of 17 billion). Chances are, that number is somewhere between 0 and 0.0001. There you go, that's your new chance of getting hacked. People really underestimate just how much just a tiny 20-34 bits can mean in an exponential context.
But I would still use multisig for anything extremely substantial, at least once CryptoCorp's wallets come out.
Edit: a possible third strategy is to generate and memorize a random password using an [error correcting code]( this is pretty complex, good software for it is not really written, and I'm not sure if it's easier to memorize 40 bits with 100% accuracy or 80 bits with 75% accuracy, but it's an interesting approach to think about.

 **UPDATE: our account seems to have been reinstated, see 
Google just removed KK's account for unspecified ToS violations. Steve sent an email asking for the details of what we did wrong, and so far have been stonewalled.
Our first priority is making sure people can get their private keys. If you are using KK, follow the instructions below, and tell all your KK-using friends to do the same:
(1) If you made a backup, then you should have your brainwallet seed in the backup file, which you can import into blockchain.info or simply pass through sha256 to get your private key out.
(2) Try closing Chrome/Chromium, shutting off internet/wifi access, and then opening Chromium. KK should become accessible, and inside of KK you can click Wallet Options -&gt; Export Brainwallet to get your brainwallet.
(3) If you did not make a backup, and (2) fails, things are a bit more complicated. Go to the following dir on Linux:
    ~/.config/chromium/Default/Local Extension Settings/
Or the following on Windows:
    ~/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/Local Extension Settings/
In that directory, type in `grep -r '"address"'`in the command line. This should give you the exact name of the file containing your wallet data, where you will be able to find a roughly 50-char string which is your brainwallet, which you can then import or convert into a privkey as described above.

Well, price stability is one example of something that you can't do (either the hard-peg bitusd/schellingcoin route, or a softer "let's try to figure out some estimate of purchasing power" route) without launching a new floating asset. Figuring out how to make at least moderately less volatile cryptotokens is still the one area that I think we haven't seen all that much research on; primarily because you need to come up with more complex monetary policies than just "hey guys here's an exponential decaying towards XXX million", and (1) it's not clear what stable real-world variables you can lean on to make smart adjustments, and of course (2) much of the culture here is opposed to anything other than hard-deflationism, though I do find many crypto-2.0 people increasingly open-minded in this latter regard.

Correct. Although $320 * 10x leverage * xxxxx BTC medium-term market depth is a lot of profit to make by shorting from knocking the price to zero. Your point is very correct in that there would be a small number of profit opportunities, but on the other hand the "short circuiting" effect also serves to make the first 1-3 profit opportunities bigger by enough to make up the difference.

I actually think it specifically was the fact that a government as major as Russia was taking the drastic step of banning Bitcoin completely.

Basically, I think that most currencies which simultaneously have (1) proof of work and (2) a finite capped supply are living on borrowed time. They have advertised themselves as being simultaneously good stores of value due to never expanding past a certain point and being secure transfer media, but the problem is that the security as a transfer medium depends on the supply expansion. For now, it appears that things are high because the subsidies are all basically in full gear. However, over the next two decades the subsidies are going to taper off drastically - by 2032, Bitcoin's PoW reward is going to be ~0.78 BTC per block, 32x less than it is now, and fees have so far been consistently at ~0.1-0.5 BTC per block over bitcoin's history so we can assume they'll stay there for a total mining reward of ~1 BTC per block. It has been estimated that currently Bitcoin costs $70 million of hardware to 51% attack; under 2032 conditions it would only cost $2 million. If BTC goes up another 1000x (ie. $5 trillion market cap, roughly same as gold), that becomes $2 billion. At that point, we have a global systemically important financial instrument which costs an amount to attack which is well within North Korea's military budget - and given North Korea's existing willingness to counterfeit US dollars we can guess exactly what they're going to do.
My view on Bitcoin is that I see it as a good replacement for gold, but not much more - for transactional use continually better and better protocols will keep replacing it. And that's fine; a technology can be great without taking over the world.
@_date: 2014-06-20 14:26:00


Agreed fully. I am not trying to be fair; fair is giving one vote to everyone, and that's not really practical here. The closest thing we can do is one vote per currency unit (ie. PoS), which is suboptimal but reasonable because currency units are the most neutral thing we have. But PoS has its own technical challenges.

The post I was replying to was quoting a post suggesting the following:


The only way to simultaneously reserve a fraction of coins and have all coins backed by BTC is to have a fractional reserve. This is basic math; if people put in 1000 BTC of coins, and you generate 250 coins for yourselves, then there are now 1250 coins backed by 1000 BTC at a 1:1 ratio, a fractional reserve.

So, a "side chain" basically means "a chain containing a currency 2-way pegged to BTC. If the side chains-specific Opcode's ever make it into Bitcoin, someone will make a subcurrency inside Ethereum that is 2-way-pegged to BTC, and so Ethereum will in some sense "become a side chain". But that point is trivial; the larger point is that the way side chain are being marketed is "we don't need more independent currencies", and in the case of price stability that is clearly false. In multi-currency networks, I could easily see there being at least three coins: a "stable coin", an "investment coin", and a few sidechains of other coins.

The guys behind it are university academics, the sort of people who are somewhat averse to risking their reputations, dealing with organizational complexities, launching a token sale, risking regulatory surprises, and all the other things involved in properly launching a crypto project especially something of that scale. They do not want to actually take the work to launch Zerocash as a proper coin (at least that's my impression from talking to Eli ben Sasson). In their current positions, they can simply work on making SCIP more awesome, and let others do the hard legwork.

There are plenty of businesses that are highly fragmented; all retail in general is like that, as are most categories of personal services. Large players exist, but they are not anything close to monopolies and small players also exist. It's specifically a matter of barriers to entry and the ratio of NRE cost to marginal cost. I am not certain on whether fragmentation of coins or consolidation of coins is better; both have benefits. The limit of fragmentation, one-coin-per-person, actually has some very interesting features, although I'm not quite sure how it will work.

I would say to that:
1. We're perfectly fine on the legal front; we have expert lawyers in Switzerland and the US who have already figured out the parameters within which we will be able to operate legally.
2. I don't see any reason why we can't have BTC as the scarce digital gold, and other assets as digital oil, etc. Yes, I know, it's an analogy and therefore imperfect, but it does express the principle that there is room for "bitcoin" as the scarce asset and everything else as a network-specific asset that's used for various kinds of incentivization.
3. You think efforts to create alternative assets are going to fail; I think they are quite likely to succeed. That's a legitimate disagreement on what is and is not going to succeed; if you are speculating on either one of the two then you are taking the risk that you turn out to be wrong and lose some or all of your investment. That's basic finance. There's no moral/immoral dimension to any of that, any more than it was immoral for Better Place to get $1 billion from investors in order to try to develop an ecosystem of electric cars that turned out to flop and waste a lot of money.

True, that's miner revenue, and miner costs are lower. Still, though, that does nothing to change the fact that the relevant variable is the amount that tx senders actually pay, which is quite low.

This doesn't resolve issues around bloat at all; the only purpose of sidechains is to allow separate blockchains to exist but using BTC as the underlying currency unit instead of our own currency. So now we have the full quadrant of choices:
1. Use the Bitcoin blockchain and Bitcoin currency (Bitcoin)
2. Use the Bitcoin blockchain and other currencies (Mastercoin, Counterparty)
3. Use a separate blockchain and the Bitcoin currency (this)
4. Use a separate blockchain and a separate currency (Ethereum)
We'll just have to see how all four models play out.
Important note: all crypto-2.0's, except for Counterparty, have an issuance component to pay for development. The technique described here specifically precludes such a tactic, unless you do a fractional reserve system which likely would end up causing far too much instability. That, and the desire to have better currency supply policies (eg. linear issuance instead of deflationary), are likely to be the main forces supporting (2) and (4). The main factors in favor of (1) and (3) will likely be a guaranteed support base from existing Bitcoin holders. The main reason to do (4) instead of (2) is efficiency, and the main reasons to do (2) instead of (4) are ease of development (at least until Ethereum comes along with our make-your-own-currency-in-ten-lines programming language :) ) and superior ability to interoperate with Bitcoin proper. It seems like all camps have a reason to exist.

You really do have to separate _Truthcoin_ from _Paul Sztorc's marketing_. The underlying project really is quite good; the core idea is one that I independently invented myself (albeit in a very different version) a year later (see  ), and the SVD mechanism IMO works quite well at optimizing the strength of the consensus for the "many binary votes" use case they are targeting. There are also many other people beyond just Paul involved (see also: [Joey Krug's post below]( and my personal semi-inside view of the project is that they are one of the very few crypto 2.0's out there that have a sufficiently high concentration of actual math/econ people rather than just marketing and run-of-the-mill developers.
I also truly applaud their marketing brilliance in having two coins and making one a BTC sidechain and selling the other; they get the benefits of being on the "everyone should build on Bitcoin" bandwagon _and_ having an actual proper monetization strategy at the same time :)

Good points, though I would offer a couple of counterpoints:
1. I would trust a smaller service with my privacy over a larger one simply because it's less likely the small service has been noticed and secretly or coercively coopted by some intelligence agency. For "don't want my boss to find out" levels of privacy, realistically both are 99.9%+ fine. "More established services are more reliable" is a good principle often, but in the cyber world where security by obscurity is realistically often your best defense things sometimes get flipped.

I would say that this statement is like saying "blue is not less than three". It does not follow from "a gun is not evil" that "a gun is non-evil" or "a gun is neutral". Rather, the entire sentence, by default, is a type mismatch error. However, in mathematics, when a function or predicate is not defined for a particular domain, it is considered reasonable to extend the definition to the domain as long as it remains consistent; this is why we have expressions like pi^e when it is clearly impossible to multiply pi by itself e times. Similarly, here I would argue that in standard English "a gun is evil" doesn't really mean "a gun is literally a psychopathic Hitler figure"; rather, it's a specialized usage which is implicitly understood to expand to "creating or supporting guns is evil". I think this is what everyone understands by that statement, and is the only interpretation that has any relevance to human activity.

I am **extremely** suspicious of this claim. The LRA problem is far too fundamental to be taken away by some clever trick.
Here's the LRA attack btw:
1. Attacker goes to all of the participants in the genesis sale, and offers them $5 in exchange for their private keys. Note that every participant can take their funds and move them to a new account, so there is no security risk from participating.
2. With &gt;50% of funds under his own control, attacker simulates a history that is indistinguishable from a legitimate history, and is in fact higher-scoring because the attacker's nodes are online 100% of the time. If tx volume is used as a heuristic, the attacker can simulate tx volume, so TaPoS/economic clusterins is NOT a solution.
The disincentive to participate is equal to p * v, where p is the probability of the attack succeeding and v is the value of one's coins. If p = 0, then the disincentive is zero so the attack wins; hence the stable equilibrium probability of success will be somewhere above zero; hence an attack is eventually guaranteed to succeed.


If you do not have slasher, then you have zero disincentive against double-signing, so you have no security. NXT's model (txfees only to remove the double-singing incentive since alt forks have no transactions on them) works to reduce the NaS incentive to zero, but the problem is that if your system relies on incentives being exactly zero then your system is vulnerable to epsilon-sized bribes. You need to have the incentives be less than zero by a **large** margin; the whole point of PoS being more secure is in fact the fact that it's possible to punish people so the margin can be greater than the reward, unlike PoW.

I'm actually not making that claim right now :)
Okay, moral philosophy time. When an interaction between multiple parties results in what one or more of the involved parties feels is an adverse consequence, there is a concept of "blame" or "moral responsibility" which can be assigned to those actions. It is the role of a moral philosophy to decide in what way blame is to be assigned.
To take a common quasi-controversial example that elicits strong moral sensibilities (to help provide an idea where I'm coming from), suppose that a woman is walking outside wearing revealing clothing and gets sexually assaulted. There exists a moral philosophy, which we will call A, which states that the woman "had it coming" and so she deserves the bulk of the blame, and the attacker deserves little blame because he took what was available / followed his natural instinct / whatever (I admit I don't understand A too well). The **prescriptive claim** of A is that the woman should not wear revealing clothing. There is an alternative moral philosophy, B, which states that the woman has the right to wear such clothing and it is the attacker that has the bulk of the blame for, well, committing an act of grave intrusion on another person's body. The prescriptive claim of B is that attackers should not attack. Other examples of this dichotomy include "don't pollute" vs "wear a mask", "don't regulate" vs "just go to another country", etc.
A good consequentialist perspective on this dichotomy is  ; if you're interested in this topic I recommend you read this article carefully, with particular emphasis on the sections that talk about whether or not pollution is "efficient".
In both cases, there is the reality, which is that some women wear revealing clothing and some men cannot control themselves. However, as human beings, we wish to change reality for the better, and our moral philosophies tell us which side of the transaction we should direct our own actions toward changing. Do we support "don't make yourself a target" ad campaigns or do we support "don't attack people" ad campaigns? Do we push for merchants to add warning labels or do we urge consumers to educate themselves? My claim is that standard libertarianism as a philosophy places blame on MtGox much more so than creditors (who, I remind, are depositors and not investors). If the creditors were investors, then under standard libertarianism they deserve everything they get under whatever terms they agreed to (plus common law to resolve anything that was left ambiguous or unspecified). Brutalism, on the other hand, as a moral philosophy always places all blame on the victim (although brutalists do sometimes basically imply that attacks are immoral if the attack is motivated by anti-brutalist morality).
TLDR: we need to work with what we have, but moral ideals also have a purpose.

2. Broadcast your real tx normally, wait for zero-conf acceptance.
3. Eligius has a 5% chance to mine your tx into the next block because it sees it first, and because it's non-standard Eligius will mine it but refuse to relay it.


Neither of those apply for a newly-created account, as I described.

You know what, for transparency purposes I'll put down my entire reply to Coindesk. Particularly see the last paragraph:


I would argue that it's a rather large inconvenience, for several reasons:
(1) People are used to currency being stable and predictable in value, and tend to be risk-averse. They do not want to put their funds into a currency when its value could completely disappear by next year. This is probably the main argument against Bitcoin that I see repeated time and time again in the media. I quote the latest anti-Bitcoin troll Ken Hess (  ):




-0.00786 BTC
-0.007965 BTC
-0.00828 BTC






And he is only one of many dozens that I've seen making this point.
(2) Tax considerations. If you have a stablecoin that maintains its value perfectly with respect to some local fiat, then you don't need to deal with the accounting issues around capital gains. With bitcoin, you very much do.  
(3) It discourages businesses from holding on to BTC, making it much more difficult for network effect scenarios to emerge where a company receives some of its revenue in BTC, holding on to it, and then using it to pay employees. Businesses want exactly zero exposure, making BTC act in many cases purely as a payment processor for the USD.  
As a side point, I think that the cryptocurrency community needs to be very clear that there is a difference between _Bitcoin_ and _cryptocurrency_, and it is perfectly reasonable to be critical of the specific features of Bitcoin but very excited about cryptocurrency as a category; many journalists outside the space don't seem to understand this point.


Nope. It's going to be speculative forever IMO. The closest parallel to BTC in terms of characteristics is gold, and gold has been about 4x more volatile than fiat currencies with respect to each other (in the past 10 years, the ratio of max to min gold/USD is about 4.6, whereas between any two mainstream fiat currencies it's pretty much always under 1.7). Now, can it be a unit of exchange? Sure, it already is (although I see its long term role as basically being a speculative crisis insurance asset, replacing gold, as it actually is superior to gold in many ways and doesn't have any clear downsides; even its wasteful PoW algorithm is substantially less wasteful than gold mining, as gold mining in addition to having a wasteful private cost of digging metal out of the ground also has strong negative environmental externalities). But for an asset to be truly stable and non-speculative it needs to have a variable supply that adjusts to market conditions. 


Both approaches have their advantage. I would argue that the endogenous stabilization approach is more appropriate for a foundational cryptocurrency like bitcoin because it doesn't introduce implicit dependencies on specific institutions (eg. targeting USD parity would essentially give the Federal Reserve control over Bitcoin); the exogenous approach may be more appropriate for separate chains that want to launch their own low-cost stable asset because they need an internal token whose value does not jump around too much.


It depends a lot on how the new units produced by the monetary policy are distributed. I don't think it would change things too much; centralization is mostly a separate problem from volatility, although reduced volatility may reduce centralization among exchanges because even smaller exchanges would be able to have lower bid/ask spreads if the price jumps around less wildly.


So, we know that price = supply / demand (roughly; it's true for currencies at least). Demand is unpredictable. Hence, you can either stabilize supply and have an unpredictable price, or stabilize price and have an unpredictable supply. My view is that no one cares about supply (how many people even know how many USD there are in circulation?) but people do care about price, so stabilizing price is more important, and that requires having the supply be adjustable based on price via some metric.


Unfortunately, we can't use another token to regulate Bitcoin's price. In order to stabilize the price of Bitcoin, we need to regulate the supply of _Bitcoin_, as per the formula above. Using another token will not do the trick. 


**My view, as I've stated above, is that Bitcoin is fine the way it is as an asset that will hopefully replace current economic functions of gold. I think Bitcoin will perform best if it is left to be conservative and do its thing well, and allow other networks to take on the functions of trying to be stable currencies, super-efficient scalable payment networks, etc. Trying to be innovative would also make Bitcoin more fragile, potentially compromising its role as gold 2.0** (although lately I have started looking into some possibilities for how the Bitcoin value pool can be leveraged to do a sort of shared decentralized proof of stake for other networks, there are some interesting possibilities there; see  )

No, security (by which I assume you mean network hashpower) does not drive (3). A side-chain is still an independent blockchain, and 51% attacks on that chain can still reverse payments on that chain. And security is a debatable matter; I think that even with the hashpower handicap you can be a lot more secure than Bitcoin if you can come up with a PoW or PoS scheme that solves the centralization issues.

The XCP fee pays for the costs incurred specifically by Counterparty users processing your transaction. These costs are not incurred by BTC users; BTC users just see UTXO and validate them, they don't even realize there's a DEX going on. Because the total social cost of a transaction among XCP users is proportional to the number of XCP users, and the value of XCP is also roughly proportional to the number of XCP users, having the fee be fixed in XCP actually makes decent economic sense.

One point where I will disagree strongly: Bitcoin mining is NOT fine, and trying to make it better is NOT a waste of time or reinventing the wheel. I visited one factory in Shenzhen that is currently producing something close to a quarter of all new ASICs being added to the network, and just yesterday we saw a single mining pool get up to 47% of network hashpower. The latter problem we can fix by requiring every miner to have a copy of the full blockchain, removing most of the benefit of centralized mining pools over p2pool, and the former problem, while much harder, must nevertheless be attempted. Sure, the industry may naturally decentralized itself over time as the market grows, but I really don't want to just sit back and hope for the best on this one. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:58:42


You might have misunderstood me a bit; I was offering a philosophical opinion, saying that the _definition_ of Bitcoin is the longest chain that follows the Bitcoin protocol, not so much a cryptographic one. Bitcoin light clients, as currently designed, might actually switch to your 1000 BTC fork, so perhaps from a descriptivist perspective you could say the Bitcoin protocol follows the majority specifically with regard to the block reward. However, this isn't really something to build a philosophy on; there is a not-too-difficult change to the Merkle tree protocol proposed by Peter Todd for Bitcoin (with a version proposed by myself for generalized state-transition systems) that completely removes that particular bug.
So it all goes down to what your definition of fiat is. You might call the protocol definition a decree; I personally call the protocol definition a consensus. Through colored coins and meta-protocols, it's actually possible to change the definition of a bitcoin without changing the source code of a single miner; a common example is to agree that any bitcoins that can be traced back at all to the Silk Road seizure are invalid. The relationship between consensus and mining is actually a very complicated issue.

I would argue the capped currency supply kind of does; unlike almost every other commodity in the world, it means that someone can seize some quantity of BTC and then be in control of 1% of the money supply forever. Land is the exception, but then that's why we had land reform movements every few centuries in history and now we have property taxes. OTOH, if Bitcoin went with a linear growth model then perhaps it would be the Bitcoin mining process that would get captured by even-more-centralized ASICs and we would just have an infinite-duration welfare program for AMD and Intel. So it's a hard problem both ways.

  * Immediately announce a donation/grant of $50k to P2Pool (note: ethereum.org may with some probability end up doing something like that ourselves)
  * Immediately announce that you are accepting grant applications for people creating an easy-to-use, turnkey solution for making your own mining pool, sort of like the platform that you see every VPS provider using. This system should obviously support Multi-PPS
  * At least acknowledge that there may be a need to make hardforking changes to the mining code, and write up a report on the options and on the realistic pathways for implementing them
I would love to see more discussion on constructive proposals.

Create a mining algorithm which forces miners to grab random UTXO from the blockchain based on each nonce, so it's not possible to mine with anything less than 100% (ok fine, 90%+) local storage. This removes the incentive to grab block headers from a centralized mining pool instead of keeping everything local with a p2pool, and also slightly weakens ASICs.
A more advanced solution might use something similar to Permacoin's proof-of-storage algo to make mining pools impossible entirely, though that does have some inconveniences.

Actually, I've been cautiously pro-PoS for about a year now, even before I was trying to make it work for ethereum. I think that burning hundreds of billions of dollars a year on useless computation is morally unconscionable, and if choosing decentralized systems as a basis for large subsets of social institutions means that we'll have to waste that much resources hashing away trillion of nonces then I would honestly feel dirty promoting such a strategy to people outside the crypto-bubble that care about the environment and economic efficiency and all that; I would instead attach myself to federated/voting-pool-based models like OpenTransactions (which, don't get me wrong, still have many use cases even if blockchains exist; I think OT is awesome). I also am very concerned about ASIC mining and pool centralization, and think that people here seriously misunderestimate just how trust-based the Bitcoin network actually is.

The reason why I make the comparison to militaries is very specific: there is a reason why military spending (in the world, not the US) is at the level it is now, and if it was 10x lower than some other party would be able to overpower the entire world combined. Hence, if PoW security spending is less than $100 billion, then a hostile power would be able to double-spend the blockchain.

Not if Google coin existed, which had an instant confirmation time, a stable value due to exchangeability with USD, and a transaction fee of $0.00. That's my worst fear for this industry right now; the fact that at current levels of tech if regulators wisen up and allow Google coin to exist we'll be dead in a month.


True, but how high is that point? The government of North Korea earns a large chunk of its income by counterfeiting USD, so the blockchain needs to be secure against an attacker of at least that size, and in my opinion substantially more. Given how important the blockchain would be, it would be a prime target for cyber-warfare, suggesting that the equilibrium cost for defending it may well be as large as current military budgets.

I used to spout this line myself, but I'm not fully convinced anymore. Gold, with its $7 trillion market cap, is going up and down 5x a decade; maybe Keynesians are right and sticky-price effects dominate, which would mean that that would stop happening if gold became the primary currency of trade and unit of account, but maybe that's not what would happen and instead it would keep bobbing up and down. It's also a very all-or-nothing proposition, which makes me quite uncomfortable personally as we would be asking society to jump into a complete unknown deep end with no precedent (empirical circumstances are so far different from the 18th and 19th centuries today that I do not consider that valid precedent). If government fiat currencies do collapse, I think the future is actually more likely to involve basically stockpiling hyperliquid product coupons.

That's unavoidable IMO. Roger Ver likely owns at least 1% of all BTC and the Winklevosses own 1%. People who already have lots of money will accumulate huge percentages regardless of whether we do premining, a fundraiser or regular mining.
Let me clarify, I am not trying to claim that "I have less than 0.000001%". I am purely making the claim that our issuance model is a middle ground between conventional premining and Satoshi-pure mining _in a qualitative sense_; that's the extent of my statement.

True. But the extra cost of verifying blocks is much less than the extra cost of verifying AND storing blocks, so the delta of altruism required is much lower. Additionally, I doubt that pools will be willing to rsync over megabytes of mining data; it's much cheaper to get it from the network (empirical evidence: Blizzard's World of Warcraft uses a P2P network to transfer over client patches), in which case validation will be necessary in any case.

I explain quite clearly in my whitepaper why Bitcoin, despite its strengths as a form of money, is actually quite terrible as a base layer protocol:
Mastercoin is the best you can do, but in its current implementation it has no scalability - the only way you can get any security at all is by downloading the entire blockchain and processing every single transaction. Mastercoin on top of Ethereum would solve all of those difficulties pretty much instantly because it stores the state of each contract in a block so ether-Mastercoin users would only need to fetch specifically their own balance from the ether-Mastercoin contract.

Granted, namereg can be a separate layer. Although, even then some kind of fee on creating an asset is necessary for anti-DDoS purposes. Now, the fee could be charged in BTC, but charging in XCP is nicer because XCP can rise and fall independently of BTC and charging in XCP ensures that your fee rises and falls with the value of XCP, a statistic proportional to the number of XCP users ie. the number of users that will have to process transactions connected to your asset, so the fee adjusts in a roughly incentive-compatible way. This is basically echoing [Jeff Garzik's recent argument against Ethereum]( except that inside of XCP/Bitcoin it's harder to adopt any of my proposed solutions involving charging a dynamic fee based on market data or stats provided by other contracts.


Monetization is usually inelegant. However, I stand by my general overarching claims (far beyond this discussion) that:
1. Creating a new currency as a monetization mechanism is far less harmful and inelegant than charging an explicit fee and trying to defend it via either network effects, proprietary software or licensing
2. The fact that you can create a new token as a monetization mechanism has a substantial chance to be a revolution in how we reward people who build things, and unlock opportunities and make things monetizable that were previously unmonetizable achieving an effect hopefully on the same scale that internet advertising did in the 2000s.
Note that my claim (2) directly contradicts the "Bitcoin will be the only one and rule them all" viewpoint (or at least the "it is morally good that Bitcoin be the only one and rule them all" subtext that is often present) that many people here support; I accept that disagreement.


So, you can do two things:
1. Two-step exchange: exchange color A for BTC for color B. Color-to-BTC can be made enforceable with high probability (ie. 100% - the probability you have of ) via ANYONECANPAY.
2. Quasi-decentralized exchange via multisig.
Both are less nice than "send a tx to make an order, send a tx to fill an order" imo.


So, I am personally wedded to the floating token strategy, and I gave reasons above to justify my stance - you have to realize there was a reason why I went with that strategy back in Jan in place of the metacoin approach, and the only difference now is the possibility of sidechains, which I don't want to use even aside from monetizability considerations because (1) I'm becoming increasingly bearish on proof of work, and (2) I would end up being at the whims of the Bitcoin mining pool oligarchy. I understand that you and others will disagree.


So, colored coins and side chains are two different things and ought not to be conflated. Side chains is interesting tech and will hopefully work well for applications that don't have enough liquidity to maintain their own highly liquid coin; for colored coins I made the arguments I made above.

Ethereum can support both models. Ethereum contracts are so powerful that you can actually embed inside of Ethereum a script which validates proofs of transactions in other currencies.

The problem is that this assumes that the world is incentive-compatible. Often it is, but it's sometimes not. There are plenty of opportunities to benefit oneself and simultaneously cause great harm to others - and yes, that includes the ability to long-term benefit oneself and cause harm to others, so the problems don't go away once you become sufficiently enlightened. Similarly, there are opportunities to harm oneself and massively benefit others, and the mechanism of trade cannot effectively arbitrage this difference because too many parties are involved (ie. public goods). Mining pool centralization might or might not, but in my opinion does, contain some of these issues.

3. Getting rid of buffet restaurants ("why does it matter if the second plate is taken by the same person or his friend, it's still the same food")
4. Removing the concept of having higher prices for next-day air tickets and first/business class (2x is fine because the seats take up more space, but not 10x). Wealthy business travellers would get to pay 50-80% less but you would have to pay something like 1.2x-1.5x more to compensate.

Sidechains are NOT a scalability solution. As far as security and scalability goes, the properties of sidechains are equivalent to the properties of altcoins; if you have 1000 sidechains then each one is 0.1% as secure, unless you merge-mine, but then altcoins can merge-mine too and so far they prefer not to, because of reasons that have been discussed at length and involve [stuff like this]( - and if those issues get resolved then merged mined altcoins will be just as scalable as sidechains are. Sidechains are a _functionality_ solution. Treechains, on the other hand, are a scalability solution, but not so much a functionality solution.

You can't simply discount the Pascal's Wager argument just like that; you need a proper refutation of it. The simplest refutation is as follows: for every hypothetical god G who gives you a more favorable afterlife if you worship him, there exists a hypothetical god G' who does the exact opposite. Since we have close to zero evidence about the properties of the actually existing god/s, there's no reason to privilege G over G' so they cancel each other out.

Completely false. The probability that a fork will succeed against an attacker with X percent hashpower after k confirmations is (X / (1 - X)) ^ k. There is no term for block time in there. You could argue that with a shorter blocktime an attack is cheaper so an attacker has more chances, eg. with 6s block times an attacker has 100x more chances, but that effect is linear, whereas the effect of adding more confirmations is exponential - assuming 30% hashpower, waiting for 12 confirmations instead of 6 reduces the probability of a fork succeeding by a factor of 161, so you get the same security in 72 seconds that Bitcoin gives you in 3600.

Your argument is mashing two things together:
1. Guns do not have morality.
2. Guns are neutral.
Those two are absolutely NOT the same thing. If Jesus is +10, Hitler is -10, then a gun is NaN, not 0. The process of producing or promoting guns is then +2 or -2 or whatever depending on what you believe. I'm arguing that the morality of a gun is both nonexistent and irrelevant (even if a gun was conscious and either nice or sadistic on the inside, no one would care), so when people talk about the morality of "guns" as a concept then they are actually referring to the morality of producing or promoting guns in basically all contexts.
To take this back to the original topic, Bitcoin, Amir's argument is that it is not a politically neutral technology, and that I agree with. The act of producing or promoting Bitcoin-related tools is one which benefits some ideologies over others, and one cannot be honest if one tries to sugarcoat this and claim that Bitcoin helps all ideologies including anarchocapitalists, the Venus project and the Zimbabwean government. Now, I personally oppose the Zimbabwean government and so I fully support use of dishonesty toward them as a means of tricking them into not fighting against Bitcoin until it's too heavily entrenched, but it is important to understand the distinction between such strategic decisions and actually believing that you are simultaneously making the world a better place for absolutely everyone.

The probability that two people will generate the exact same hash is 1 in 2^256, and the probability that you will generate a hash that corresponds to a private key that happens to correspond to the same Bitcoin address as someone else is 1 in 2^160. In short, even if every computer in the world were to try repeatedly generating hashes it would take a couple billion billion years.

That requires a large degree of (1) forethought, (2) startup capital. Possible I suppose, but unless you start the attack within a few months of launch it would probably take almost as much money as just 51%-attacking the currency "the normal way".


Sure. But in that case, those e-wallets run nodes that log on more more than once every 3 months, and if the attack involves coercing those e-wallets into moving onto bad checkpoints then note that you can force e-wallets to move onto a bad checkpoint in a PoW currency as well.


If they are just accessing their savings, then it's actually not so bad to be on a different fork. You send a transaction which moves funds to another address in the exact same way. The only parties who are actually harmed by being on the wrong chain are (1) merchants, and (2) users that need to exchange tokens between different chains, and in case (2) you can come up with heuristic fixes by having the chains checkpoint each other.


And except that the relevant data is 32 bytes long instead of a few hundred kilobytes to megabytes. And if government is powerful enough to stop people from sharing _32 bytes_ then it's probably powerful enough to launch 51% attacks against any kind of PoW or PoS.

There are basically only three kinds of economic tools that can be used to manage and reallocate risk in a trust-requiring scenario between low-reputation parties:
1. Sacrifices (party A consumes resources, never gets anything back)
2. Deposits (party A transfers resources to party B, gets them back at the end, but party B can steal in the interim)
3. Hostages (party A transfers resources to party B in such a way that party B can either eventually give control back to A, or destroy the resources without benefiting)
The nice thing with PoB, as you mention, is that unlike many protocols that use sacrifices and hostages in the real world, here the destruction of BTC does not translate into a destruction of economic value; the value simply gets redistributed proportionately among everyone else. Hence, the protocols are actually _efficient_ (ie. not wasteful). The only way the protocol could conceivably be made even more efficient if the resources were instead transferred to some mechanism that provides a public good (eg. charity).
So my recommendation would be for some kind of system where users would maintain a list of approved charities, and if a given user had a certain charity in common with very many other users, then the sacrifice funds would go to the charity instead. Might be somewhat complicated in practice though.

Except that you didn't provide a plausible mechanism by which kicking me in the nuts does improve my chance of an afterlife. In the case of Pascal's wager, there is such a plausible mechanism: there exists a deity which likes being worshipped. And in cryopreservation, there also is a mechanism: people in the future with superior technology wake you up. In order for that to be possible, the only requirements are that (1) biomedicine can conceivably be drastically improved from where it is today, (2) a very large part of the information encoded in a human brain survives the storage process. I think both of those are true.

And it's a hard problem, figuring out how Bitcoin capital gains should be taxed. Having cryptocurrency gains be tax-free isn't really an option, since that would turn DACs/DAOs/branded coins into the ultimate tax loophole (I make my own branded coin, 99% premine it and let people trade the other 1%, you employ me by purchasing units of the coin and provably destroying them so the value of my coin goes up; and for DACs it's even more obvious). OTOH, any other approach necessarily implies keeping track of every transaction. The "tax-free after 1 year" found in Germany and the idea of a small exemption are decent patches for now, but it becomes a very difficult problem in the long term.

The way truthcoin does it is by letting everyone with votecoins vote on what the truth is and rewarding everyone who goes along with the majority consensus. If you believe that everyone else will act honestly, then your incentive is to act honestly because you want to be close to the majority, and so the mechanism reinforces itself. It's a very similar game-theoretic-argument to why people continue building on the longest chain in proof of work instead of repeatedly coordinating on double-spends.

Right. That's what I do; I have a route on the server which forwards the transaction along. I do see the privacy issue, but I would argue it's a bit overrated - although you do learn the IP address of the sender, you're hiding the IP address of the sender from eligius or blockchain.info, so exactly one party learns the IP address of the sender either way.

I visited an ASIC factory in Shenzhen. They build the devices to become bricks every 3 months; some of the boards literally had some circuits misaligned 5-10 degrees. The ASICs outcompete each other so quickly that lifetime simply does not matter and it cuts the costs down. So making a trivial expansion to the design every 2 years is not a problem at all.

So we're agreeing that it's legal responsibility and not multisig key storage that matters. In that case, I have provided the details: the BTC are currently held by Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, of which I am a director, and the GmbH is owned by the Stiftung, of which I am the president and the other 6 directors I gave you in some other post. So if the corp commits malfeasance then your strategy for achieving redress is probably to sue the corp, and if that fails try to pierce the corporate veil and target the mentioned individuals (including myself).


It actually makes me sad to hear that. We are all trying sincerely to get this project going, and I've contributed to a lot of software and writing in the cryptocurrency space for free, even risking the legal issues that you know about too well because I really want to see decentralized technologies prosper.

It won't work for CPUs, I agree.

My personal strategy is that when I see a large drop I forget that I hold units of it and turn into day-trader mode, thinking how I can time a buy to eke out a chunk of profit from the volatility.
But in general, I don't think the markets are overreacting. The fact is, pricing BTC now is a VERY hard problem. What is the chance that Bitcoin will "truly succeed" and reach $100,000+? Is it 0.1%? 1%? 10%? 70%? Just because the range is so large, every event quite reasonably results in a significant price movement.

Actually, I would disagree there. Sure, the act of putting money in your mattress is by itself useless. However, when you are doing that what you are actually doing is producing some quantity of goods (when earning the money in the first place) and consuming a smaller quantity of goods. Hence, the quantity of goods floating around in limbo in the world goes up. Hence, due to supply and demand, prices go down, allowing other people to spend a little more. This includes people with all sorts of time preference profiles: some of the surplus will go to drug addicts for their next fix, some of it will go to normal people to spend on more things, and some of it will go to investors. Some of it will even go to the government. Hence, putting money under your mattress is, to a partial extent, an act of investing in all of society.
There are good reasons to oppose deflation; I think the main ones are that monetary supply expansion can be used to fund welfare and public goods (this is not particularly true in our FRB-based banking model, since all base-money is multiplied 10x, but would be true in Bitcoin land) and the fact that inevitable errors in the workings of the market (eg. political corruption, theft, inheritance) should be washed away rather than compound over time. Historically, the only other truly fixed-supply commodity, land, would get so concentrated every few hundred years that there would be a land reform movement to redistribute it, and even now we only "solved" the problem by implementing a micro-land-reform every year in the form of property taxes.
The sticky price argument is also interesting, though my current position is that (1) wages are really not that sticky since companies have a habit of routinely cutting bonuses and perks during recessions, and in fact the concept of benefits arguably at least partially emerged as a workaround to the "how to reduce compensation without making people feel bad" problem and (2) such circumstances are an artifact of a usually-inflationary world experiencing sudden deflationary shocks, and deflationary systems would have different cultural norms.
TLDR: it's much more complicated than the "this kind of -flation is good, the other kind is bad" that both sides try to spout.

The $44 per transaction refers to the quantity of resources that the network consumes on mining. Mining is a static sunk cost; at 2x the transaction volume it would go down to $22 per transaction. It's also not something that the transaction sender pays, since the sender pays only the fee of $0.06.

Peter Todd is the only person so far who has come up with anything close to a credible solution for blockchain scalability (well, a few others have some ideas and I have one or two half-baked proposals myself, but I can trace those back to tree chains for inspiration). Side chains is not a scalability solution (caveat: unless the side-chain is a tree chain); it's a solution for adding new features in an alt-chain but using the same monetary unit. As Peter describes they're only secure if the majority of the Bitcoin network agrees to mine each one, which means that miners need to process the majority of all transactions anyway. Tree chains on the other hand can theoretically offer arbitrary-factor scalability.

That's actually a useful feature. It lets people easily use rushwallet to access any brainwallet that they created outside the system.


Creating your own brainwallet _is the whole point_ of brainwallets. [Studies show]( that computer-generated passphrases like the so-called Electrum "brainwallets" are not a single bit more memorable than random hexadecimal gook. Sure, some people will make bad passwords; the best fix to that is probably standardizing (1) a username:password schema instead of just a password, and (2) a better brainwallet algorithm than sha256; this would make even relatively weak 8-10 char passphrases secure again. I do both on  and if other people want to either copy my approach or suggest and standardize a better one we would be happy to integrate it.
Also, I suppose as a moderate solution we could have something which says "WARNING, CUSTOM-GENERATED BRAINWALLET. RELOAD THE PAGE UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING".

Hi, here :)
Your argument is completely wrong. The Bitcoin mining ecosystem is driven by hard economic laws, and the law of primary importance in this case is that marginal cost and marginal revenue tend to approach each other over time. In a normal market, it's cost that's fixed, so costs to consumers decline over time (up to a point) even without new advances in technology. Bitcoin, however, is not a normal market; in fact it's the exact opposite. It's marginal revenue that's fixed; namely, to 25 BTC per 10 minutes. Hence, marginal cost always approaches that figure. As a poster below me said, if you double the efficiency of the mining process, the number of miners will just double and we'll be back where we started. We saw it happen with GPUs and ASICs already.


Gaak. There is a VERY big difference between the Bitcoin network and the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Bitcoin ecosystem is what we want to grow; the strength of the Bitcoin network is only useful insofar as we need security, and security is only useful up to a point. 2x security right now might raise the price of Bitcoin by 1-5%, but probably not much more. Furthermore, security is relative; if there are technological advances that make mining 100 times more efficient, those advances are available to attackers as well, so _the playing field has not been changed at all_ - it's simply the case that the entire game is shifted by two decimal places.

Yes, the protocol is still useful. Their consensus algorithm has superior scalability properties in the context of high-trust environments, and is at the very least better than SWIFT.

That's _your_ opinion, and to a somewhat lesser but still very large extent mine. It's not the opinion of normal people around the world. Normal people care about speed and efficiency, as well as power and functionality, trustlessness less so. Our goal should be to try to figure out how to make a high degree of trustlessness cheap, to the point that people simply adopt it as a default when building applications. "cheap" is the key operative word here; $650m per year at a $5b valuation plus $0.05 per tx is decidedly not cheap, especially once centralized fiat ledger tech modernizes s bit.

I don't think this will be a substantial roadblock for miners. Even at a 500gb blockchain, it just means that mining ASICs will need to come with a big hard drive and a CPU. Because they are professional and profit-driven, miners can afford to incur high loads that grandma can't. Last time I checked, decreasing full nodes were also a crisis, so this has a two-birds-with-one-stone effect. As for pools, I'm sure multi-PPS will improve things, but I'm not sure that having a reserve is the bottleneck and that fees are set based on the economic model; I think there's also a large component of convenience at play (namely, that CEX.io sells mining contracts that go straight into GHash).

False on two counts, actually. First, litecoin, dogecoin, bitshares and NXT seem to be supporting their blockchains on non-bitcoin currencies just fine.
Second, it turns out that you can maintain a secure blockchain with no currency at all, using transactions-as-proof-of-work. See: 
The interesting thing is that once the inflationary period of Bitcoin runs out, the security of TaPoW as I describe in that link and the security of txfees+mining will actually be exactly the same.

Sounds like you consider refunds a prerequisite for a token sale being sufficiently safe for yourself to participate. That's fine. We have no evidence that our purchasers and the crypto 2.0 community at large considers what we are doing unreasonable, so we're sticking to our current strategy; if the community starts demanding refunds then we will consider changing our stance.
The standards for how crowdsales should be done have not really been set in stone since it's such a new industry; if you think things should be done differently then I would recommend that you write up your own proposal for how sales should be done and publish it. If it gets widespread public support, then projects will begin to follow it.

Agreed. I was assuming the event we were talking about is the probability of the first hash below 2^80 though. The maximum likelihood point for that is 2^80 total work, I agree, but that doesn't mean much; there's still only like a 0.02 chance that it will be exactly within 36 hours. It's like rolling 10000 dice and finding that the average is 3.5001; sure, it's what you expect, but it's also unlikely that you get _that_ close.

Technically false, for two reasons:
1. 1 CPU = 0.00001 votes, [one of these]( is one vote. And the number of voters that make a quorum is pretty small...
2. It's users that decide what's ultimately valid, not miners. If everyone downloaded a patch saying that SHA256 would cease to be the mining algorithm after block 350000 and from then on it would instead be SHA3, then once block 350000 comes along, the chain that everyone will recognize will be the chain produced by the SHA3 miners, regardless of how powerful the SHA256 miners are.
So crypto protocols are indeed ultimately controlled by social forces, and those social forces can indeed take forms that have greater or lesser de-facto centralization (for high de-facto centralization, see bitshares with dan larimer's posts making the price jump up and down by 15%, for lower centralization see current bitcoin (for now) ).

Since it is important to not just criticize but be constructive, here's my idea of what a moderately decent compromise proposal might look like:
1. Regulations ONLY affect Bitcoin holding companies and exchanges. Everyone else (eg. wallet providers, currency issuers, etc) remain unregulated.
2. Bitcoin exchanges need to get personal information for the  party initiating the transaction, and only above $10k. For values between $100 and $10k, cellphone verification is sufficient, and $100 or less requires no KYC/AML at all except reasonable measures to ensure that one is not being sybil-attacked. For volumes below $1m per month, they only need to register with a simple form, no crazy fingerprints-to-FBI and full-background-check BS. Above $1m, a second tier of licensing is added.
3. Bitcoin holding companies do not need to do any KYC/AML at all; they should only be affected by consumer-protection rules.
4. Multisig companies (defined as holding companies where the business itself does not have the unilateral ability to withdraw customers' funds and the customer has the eventual ability to access their funds without that specific company's cooperation) are explicitly exempt from regulation.
5. Keep earnings in whatever currency you want. Only if a tier of licensing requires a security deposit should the specific quantity of funds allocated for that deposit be held in USD.
6. If you make reasonable efforts to block New York, then you are free and clear, even if you get a few accidental customers slipping through with a VPN.

There are arguments in favor of TTPs, and sometimes the hazards of TTPs outweigh their benefits and sometimes they do not, and the dividing line between the two categories rests entirely on case-specific empirical considerations?




Umm... Bitcoin and crypto 2.0 technology allows us to replace certain functions of the state in certain specific areas. It does nothing to implement a decentralized mechanism for providing welfare, fighting climate change, ensuring personal security, etc, etc. Now, you can definitely try to build platforms using crypto to [solve]( [such]( [problems]( but **such platforms have not been built yet**, and it's still not certain exactly what algorithms said platforms will run on if they are possible at all. So if you care about this issue, please join one of those projects now. Until they're built, the statement "we couldn't find a safer way yet" is in many cases correct.


Empirically, most tax evaders are not caught by tracking the financial system. They are caught because people are detected living a lifestyle that is inconsistent with their reported income. With heightened government surveillance in the real world, this is only going to go further in the government's favor.


Property taxes, carbon taxes, road tolls, revenue from national parks, sovereign wealth funds, tariffs, taxes on specific physical goods? I'm willing to bet you can get government revenue well above 15% GDP without any taxation on income, sales and wealth whatsoever.

The proof is embedded in the blockchain, but not the UTXO set, so nodes can exist that keep the proof stored in a hard drive for archival purposes but only keep the UTXOs in easily accessible form. So, it is a scalability problem to some extent. One of the reasons I actually think sidechain tech would work really well with ethereum; you can simply maintain a light client for chain A inside of a contract on chain B and vice versa, and each header only appears once in the other chain, so it's really efficient.

So everyone loves talking about "network effects", but the level of rigor around discussion of the concept is unfortunately pretty low all around, which in part motivated my post [here]( There are really two major separate categories of network effects applicable to blockchain tech: currency network effects (applicable to BTC the currency) and platform network effects (applicable to BTC the platform), and each one is completely independent of the other (eg. sidechains have currency network effects but there is no reason to expect them to have platform network effects). Which network effect do you care about here? Are you looking for quick exchangeability with BTC? If so, why not just use BTC?

I don't think that's an absolute law so much as an empirical observation; to take a very blatant counterexample, romantic pair bonding has remained very decentralized and does not have any kind of power law distribution where the top 100 people have 20000 spouses each. My intuition is that the best we can do is target the same level of centralization that money itself has; a well-designed PoS scheme should do that. PoW has the potential to introduce superlinearity due to specialized development costs, which is basically what good PoW should maximally avoid.

Sure, some low-level technology might work that way, but the closer you get to implementations the weaker that argument gets. Cures for cancer are purely positive technologies; their only purpose is to help people live longer and happier lives. Bioweapons are pure evil, because even if used against an enemy army there is no way to stop their impact from very rapidly spreading. Industrial technology implicitly promotes centralization, communications technology implicitly promotes decentralization. Castles promote powerful city-states, guns promote the exact opposite. Every technology ends up having a net impact on society by definition, and every impact on society necessarily makes some people happy and others unhappy. So Amir is completely right on this one IMO.

Yes, and I have:
  
  
  
Unfortunately all of my solutions rely on PoS, which the Bitcoin community seems to dislike; oh well.


The problem is that I feel Bitcoin 1.0 may well never be mainstream. Sure, it's ahead of centralized systems _for now_, but the fact is that its gain over existing systems, especially the systems that will exist in 10 years, is too marginal for it to go very far, except in niche use cases like donating to wikileaks and buying from silk road. Basically, I see 2.0 as being the only thing that can possibly bring 1.0 mainstream acceptance.


I actually have proposed three solutions:
1. Widespread adoption of DPOS-like approaches to in-protocol governance that pay for continued development, allowing every coin to itself become its own 2.0
2. Implicit extra-protocol DPOS is also a viable option. For example, it is established that the Ethereum social contract is that the quantity of ether should not exceed 60102216 * (1.198 + 0.26 * n) where n is the number of years past the genesis block. Once we go PoS, the intrinsic inflation will fall way below that. Hence, once/if ethereum.org goes bankrupt, anyone will be free to release their own "Ethereum 3.0" which allocates the difference to themselves, once again allowing individual cryptocurrencies to survive for a much longer term. Bitcoin is stuck with its fixed-supply dogma, which is good for digital gold, but unfortunately locks away this solution (as well as solution 1).
3. This idea that I [mentioned in a recent blog post](

See, as mentioned above, that's my problem. I don't like the idea that people have to maintain servers; I see a primary benefit of decentralization being that people can be lazy and don't have to worry about maintennance one the initialization step is done.


Problem: they're all built on Bitcoin, and so all _Bitcoin_ full nodes have to be aware of the UTXOs for every single color ever alongside the uncolored ones. So it doesn't scale. The only thing that scales is multi-chain architecture, which I will be the first to concede Ethereum 1.0 does not provide.

To be fair, Satoshi centrally planned the Bitcoin issuance schedule too. And if your reason to dislike central planning is the Hayekian "they don't have enough information" concern, then you might want to note that Satoshi had _even less information_ than central planners, since planners decide the money supply for 2025 in 2025 whereas he decided the Bitcoin supply for 2025 in 2008. Now if your dislike of central planning is "people in power have bad incentives", then I'll grant the point more, although from there you can then make the point that [more flexible money supplies]( might be superior provided that the monetary policy mechanism is decentralized.

3. Double-spend the exchanges, profit!
4. Watch coin go down, profit more!
So it would be quite beneficial to the economy of North Korea or ISIS.

I don't believe the regression theorem is invalid, I never said that. Bitcoin cleverly satisfies the regression theorem: its original pre-money use is as a prediction market on its future value as a currency.


I would say no. We've been biased toward one currency so far largely because of convenience, but hyper-efficient communications infrastructure and smart wallets solve that problem. The only problem with having 1000 cryptocurrencies today is that each one of them would have weaker consensus; if all currencies could somehow get on a shared consensus infrastructure that would make everything substantially more robust imo. I see the primary benefit of a multicurrency ecosystem being that different currencies can be used to incentivize particular protocol-specific behaviors, and that having protocols be on their own currencies also provides greater stability as the value can rise and fall rather than a fixed-exchange-rate system which might lead to fractional-reserve situations in some cases.

The word "money laundering" is used in two ways. In general, the crime of money laundering specifically refers to knowingly aiding and abetting criminals by helping them transfer their funds undetectably. However, anti-money-laundering laws in practice are often basically anti-financial-privacy laws. Cody is taking this perversion and playing on it, using the secondary meaning of "money laundering" and trying to turn it into a good thing. It's exactly equivalent to the "Pirate Party".


This is complicated, since I only partially agree with him and have to distinguish between promoting my own viewpoints and depending his, and I may have erred somewhat in that regard. His views are that the establishment is pro-(i) but anti-(ii) (where (i) is efficiency and (ii) is privacy as above), and wants to create a Bitcoin that meets those needs. He is pro-(i) and pro-(ii). Now, when he says "go in a different development direction", what he wants is to _transfer resources_ from (+i, -ii) to (+i, +ii) and thereby on net promote (ii). The question of whether to do this is entirely different from the other question, which is whether or not the (+i, -ii) actions of the Bitcoin establishment are a good thing by themselves. One could argue that the Bitcoin establishment is evil because it is trying to _neuter_ what could be a powerful force for liberty and provide something which is _no better_ than the fiat system today, in which case (+i, -ii) is neutral, or one could argue that the BE is evil because it is trying to pervert a force for liberty into the ultimate surveillance machine which is even more terrible, in which case (+i, -ii) is bad. I don't know which of those two he is closer to. He is very ideological, and it's often hard to ask such people to choose between two evils. 


I think the general counterargument is "they can get any of us, but they can't get all of us". This is the best that a decentralized movement can do against a government, and I hope they succeed in getting that far. Of course, just because the slogan exists does not mean that it applies to every software package. Guess we'll have to wait and see.

Just to clarify, the correct algo would be:
Let `UTXO[b,i]` be the ith UTXO in block b modulo the number of UTXO in block b (eg. if block 720 has 20 UTXO, then UTXO[720,73] = UTXO[720,93] = the 13th UTXO in block 720)
    def try_nonce(block_number, block_header, nonce):
        h = sha256(block_header)
        n = []
        for i in range(20):
            n.append(bin_to_int(sha256(h + nonce + str(i))))
        o = []
        for i in range(20):
            bn = (n[i] / 2**128) % block_number
            o.append(UTXO[bn, n[i]])
        return sha256(str(o)) &lt; 2**256 / diff
Trying a nonce thus requires picking 20 random UTXO per nonce, making server fetching prohibitively expensive, whereas verifying a nonce requires only 20 total fetches of Merkle branches making it quite viable.
Edit: we can chain the requests, ie. `n[i] = sha256(o[i-1])`, to prevent parallelization

The probability that a particular bitcoin address will have no matching privkey is (1 - 1 / 2^160 )^2^256, or 1/e^(2^96), so the probability that there exists even one bitcoin address with that property is around 1/e^(2^89); in short, unless SHA256 or RIPEMD160 are flawed, it's pretty much guaranteed that no such key-free address exists.

The big change that started to happen around 2000 is that software started moving to the web, and software started to become collaborative - meaning that it wasn't just a private app that you download to your computer, it's something that you do with other people. This means that software developers now have a new weapon - network effects. Facebook's software is not particularly impressive; people come and stay for the network. That was what made open source practical - the code is a peripheral, it's the community that matters.
2. Most software today is still closed-source - in fact, it's even more closed source than it was in the 1980s. The "software" is just in the form of web applications, where half the app is on a server. At least if you have a copy of MS Windows, you can reverse engineer it, run it inside a VM, wireshark it to see if it's sending out any data, etc. You also know that your data is still private, and you can access it. With modern web apps, it's all on Facebook's servers, and you have no way to know what they're doing to your data.
There was no great moral victory in society, incentives just changed somewhat (I can go into more detail if you wish but I have a dark hunch that many so-called "moral victories" in society are really a result of economic parameters changing to make the world more incentive-compatible making certain classes of "moral" behavior more "affordable" from a private-incentive standpoint). So, I now wonder, is there going to be some new fundamental development in cryptoeconomics that makes all three of the funding methods above obsolete? If so, as long as it doesn't introduce plenty of new problems in its own right I would be happy to applaud it.

Basically, the optimal way to do it is to build in a reputation system, where people can trust whatever sources they want, and the ratings they see for products are based on who they trust (eg. if I have 60% trust for A, and A has a +20% rating for B, then I see a +12% rating for B). This system generalizes very nicely into a complete decentralized regulation engine; you can do standard the "only buy stuff from merchants that people I know trust" thing, or you can set up special users whose sole purpose is to assign ultra-negative ratings to certain classes of "bad things" and zero or positive to everything else. For example, one special user might exist that would assign -100% to drugs, guns and child porn, another user might exist to certify things organic, maybe in some utopian far future the FDA would maintain a special user assigning -100% to unlicensed medicines, etc.
Then, in the client you would have the user assign a 100% trust rating to the "downrate illegal stuff" user by default, which would ensure that anything that is illegal would get, depending on the interface, either moved to the last page or made invisible entirely. That's the backend; it gives you maximum modularity and simplicity by putting all anti-fraud, anti-bad-actor and recommendation functionality into a single system. It also lets anyone maintain their own filtering users, and forks are able to set their default trust lists to whatever filters they want. On the front end, you can probably look to how Android phones work with rooting; hide a "sudo" option deep into the interface requiring you to google to figure out how to do it, and then once you get into root mode you can change your trust ratings for the default users as you wish and get "the full experience™".

You speak as if human social relationships don't exist at all. If that incredibly unlikely event (the asteroid hurting us that badly and not just killing us all) does happen, then people will have histories and they will have a record of what the last block was before the incident. Once the time comes to restart the cryptocurrency, they will then come together and agree on one of the latest block hashes as a checkpoint. If you are a new user, who do you trust? Simple: you trust (1) your friends, (2) people who ran established prominent companies, nonprofits or governments before the incident, (3) whoever developed the client software you're running, etc. The information exists; the only benefit that PoW could provide is slightly more usability since there's no need to manually locate the checkpoint, and that hardly justifies hundreds of billions of dollars expenditure.

Sure, working only against the UTXO set is reasonable. The problem is, though, in order to determine what UTXO are eligible you need access to the full blockchain, so even verification with a light client would be impossible, unless you maintain Patricia trees of UTXO per block. I'm fine with that; I'm using that in my own project as you're aware; I was just proposing the most minimal and easy-to-implement modification (Patricia trees seem to be damn hard to code and debug in my experience, so I would rather not have them unless we agree that their benefit is worth the cost). Allowing lite verification that doesn't verify the utxo part is doable I suppose but you have to be careful; the "headers-only part" needs to be the majority of the work because otherwise a miner could pull off something like a 5% attack against lite nodes.
Edit: I suppose a challenge-response protocol (ie. "hey, any node, can you give me a UTXO that already spent this UTXO used for the PoW here") could also be used in place of Patricia trees, but you would need to be careful to make the selection algorithm not dependent on the full chain; something like "keep trying sub-nonces until an unspent TXO is found" would work.

So the equilibrium supply is the supply S where loss = gain. Gain = 0.26 * G where G is a constant (the genesis sale quantity). Assuming that the loss rate is k (say, 0.5%), then loss = k * S. Hence, gain = loss when 0.26 * G = k * S, so S = 0.26 * G / k, which is a constant (specifically, assuming G = 53 million and k = 0.5%, S ~= 2,756,000,000). Around the equilibrium, there probably will be factors that affect the entire economy and shift things in one direction or the other (eg. rapid adoption or loss of interest of contracts that permalock ether) so the supply may have multi-year-long periods of growth or decline. But that's a multi-century concern; at this point I would prefer to focus my time on making sure that Ethereum can survive until 2030.

Well, if you use triple-entry accounting, M can collude to double-spend. You retain the property that they can't steal balances arbitrarily.

If you engage in honest commerce, you are also making yourself dependent on others. So that's not really an argument either way.

No one can; see Peter Todd's arguments that unconfirmed transactions are worthless unless you trust the merchant. He was the one who actually convinced me of that; before one of my major misgivings against MSC/XCP indeed was the unconfirmed transaction support :)


1. Create a 2-of-2 multisig address M.
2. B creates an unsigned tx from A to M.
3. A signs the TX, and creates a tx from M to A with a locktime, which A sends to B.
4. B signs the TX, and gives to A.
5. A makes a TX that sends from M to (99% A, 1% B) with a slightly lower locktime, signs and sends to B, repeat.
This protocol by itself may or may not have flaws, I just came up with it, but I don't see a reason why something like it can't work in a metacoin context. The key realization is that what you're creating is a 2-of-2 account, and in order to make a send from that account you need to spend an output from that account as a signature, so the same old channel protocol should apply. And in any case people in the real world don't really micropay-channel each other in stocks all that often...


The last I've seen from Peter Todd on colored coins is [this]( which basically echoes my position exactly despite having a different connotation (namely, the assumption that most colors are going to be small). Having the creator of a color be actively online in order to reissue coins is also rather ugly, and I often use "you don't have to bother managing a server" as an argument for why people should move to decentralized tech (one of my "secrets", to use Peter Thiel's terminology, is that one of decentralization's key benefits for startups is precisely the fact that people are too lazy to manage servers if they can help it, even if that's technically the more efficient approach from a private-incentive standpoint).


XCP trading has lower latency (1 block) than any centralized exchange I've seen (3 blocks in, login, 1 block out, etc). The fact that you don't need to make and maintain an extra account I think is by itself enough of an improvement to make on-chain DEXes superior.
Also, quasi-decentralized colored coin exchanges also charge a fee for the atomic swap.

It would if this was the only incident, but in the wider context of the [MtGox vs Coinlab lawsuit]( Charlie Shrem's arrest, the MtGox collapse and the under-discussed [international chapter scandal]( it's actually a pretty reasonable sentiment IMO.


Has the Bitcoin Foundation done any actual "managing the blockchain"? [Last time I remember]( any such thing was even useful in the first place, the relevant governance activities simply happened by having major mining pool operators come together over IRC, do what needed to be done and then disband.

The problem is that PUFs are more like hash functions than signature schemes; there's no way to verify their outputs. From the point of view of the outside world, a PUF chip is indistinguishable from a flash drive containing a bunch of random numbers that picks and outputs a new random number each time it [receives a new distinct input]( and there is (I believe) no way to produce even two PUFs that have the same behavior.

I think you're confused about how much power these hashes actually give you. All that a hash does is let the small subset of nodes that are offline more than a year determine which of multiple forks to go to when they come back online. Note that in order for the ability to manipulate hashes to have any use at all, an alternate fork needs to exist. That itself requires the cooperation of a large portion of all stakeholders; all that NaS means is that those stakeholders don't have the incentive of losing their deposits if they sign; they still have other incentives, and the whole process would be very obvious and public so the fork can be blacklisted in clients even as it's being produced. Second, checkpoints will not be used by nodes that have been online in the past year. You could say "well a powerful government could force client developers to actually ignore the protocol and switch to a different checkpoint, but then that applies to PoW too. Without convincing people to switch protocols, the best a malicious hash provider can do us cause a small netsplit. 
As for scalability, it is possible to do light client PoS; the consensus algo just needs to have a highly discrete component. Will ask Vlad to formalize this soon or do it myself in a blog post.

The Bitcoin protocol is a protocol, it is not managed by any party and does not have intent. Transaction fees may indeed be a service, and should probably be taxed as such especially since the money is actually being transferred from the payer to the miner, but I agree with the lawyer that creating new bitcoins is much more analogous to creating gold, especially since it's being taxed like property now.


Now that is an interesting legal puzzle. A commodity with built-in legitimized rules for stealing it. Would mining be even legal then? Or do you consent by using the protocol? If so, is it taxed as creation, gift or transfer? Any lawyers want to take that one?

My personal preference is "fluidizing" the whole thing: remove the concept that every post has an "absolute score" entirely, and instead have the score for every post that you see be the sum of upvotes and downvotes weighted by your web of trust score for each voter. A set of simple interface options can then be layered on top:
* Unmoderated pure laissez faire: assign a trust score of 0 to everyone
* Pure community voting-based moderation: assign a trust score of 1 to everyone
* A reddit specific to technology: create a virtual user called "technology", have that user upvote any post if the poster of that post wants them to, and if you want to see the technology reddit then assign a trust score of 1 to technology
* A reddit specific to technology, plus moderation: find a set of trusted moderators, and assign them a trust score of 1 and a trust score of 0.5 to the "technology" user
* Decentralized moderation: assign a high trust score to close friends and people who you know share your preferences, and a low trust score to everyone else

As one of the "Bitcoin kids" referred to by the article (in case you don't remember, aside from being involved in "etherium", I wrote ~67% of the articles in the pictured Bitcoin magazine with the Guy Fawkes mask, which I guess in Bitcoin time also makes me a greybeard), I'll actually have to deemphasize this aspect somewhat. We've had cultural revolutions before, and there have been plenty of people working outside the system. There have also been plenty of instances of people being outside radicals at first, but then taking over and proving to be no better than their predecessors; cases like MtGox certainly show that as a group we're not much better. What matters is that crypto now has a perfect storm:
1. Political and economic circumstances helping to drive a cultural revolution (of which I suppose "Bitcoin kids" are a part)
2. A genuinely interesting new technology
3. A built-in monetization mechanism
Either of those would have failed on its own, and two out of three only make moderate impact. Just (1) was Occupy Wall Street. Just (2) is something like Tahoe-LAFS (which is awesome tech, but clearly has not caught on). (1) + (2) would be something like torrents on the good side and Diaspora on the bad side, and (2) + (3) would be most of Silicon Valley.
Cryptocurrency has the radical decentralist roots of cy(b|ph)erpunk culture, but the reason why it has succeeded so much where everything else has relatively failed is that there's money involved, which gives people license to pursue it as a full-time job, and not just an altruistic side-project. Strategies like token sales and namespace sales (something which has not been tried yet, but really should) are also a powerful addition, because you can now for the first time monetize decentralized technologies without having to relegate yourself to the (IMO vastly insufficient) tactic of "selling services". This alone means that something like Diaspora is 10x more likely to succeed now than it would 5 years ago. And the combination of personal wealth, community wealth (we all profit from BTC going up) and the all-important factor of ideology creates a combined set of incentives basically touching every part of Maslow's hierarchy, driving more people to participate.
The fact that this involves trust-free technologies is very important. If this was simply a matter of "stop trusting those corrupt and boring Beltway types, trust us wonderful people from Shenzhen and San Francisco", then the crypto revolution would be nice for 10 years but then eventually degrade into being the same old thing. The fact that this is a technology, and the point of the technology is to create a new foundation that allows individuals to be in control of their own digital and financial identities, is crucial in preventing that from happening. It's not "don't be evil", it's "can't be evil".

So, Nicolas Courtois is an alarmist. Read all of his articles with this in mind. This is an attack on specific classes of wallets in specific circumstances - namely, attacks where an entity with the master public key to an organization can sometimes exploit bad random number generators to determine the master private key. HD wallets aren't really being used in this way (giving untrusted parties master public keys to an account so they can track the addresses but not spend from it) yet so it's not too big a deal, but it is a problem if we do start using them that way. RFC6979 is a way of replacing the randomness in ECDSA with a pseudorandom number generator that uses the private key and the message hash as a source, and as long as SHA256 is secure it should not ever have any of these issues.

There's a difference between "spending subsidies" that involve encouraging spending on specific things, spending subsidies that are really redistributions toward people more likely to spend (which is what the $600 check was), and spending subsidies that are just blockchain-enforced incentives to send to some address. The second isn't really a "subsidy" in the economic sense, the first works because you can check if the transactions were actually made, but the third fails because people can simply trick the blockchain by sending to themselves. The problem is that cryptography is dumb, not that subsidies don't work economically.

For those who can't parse what that means, he's essentially suggesting what [we call]( a metacoin, like MSC, colored coins or XCP.

Not really. We've known about sidechains since April, and the paper provided basically no new information beyond "the project still exists" so no surprises there.


Yep, a dapp store is in the works.


We got 2 guys in Silicon Valley that are soon gonna be implementing a decentralized BTC -&gt; ETH asset exchange by having an ETH contract essentially serve as an SPV client for BTC inside of ETH.


1. We realized that for dapps to work properly we needed to add a blockchain feature for logging events (basically, a proof of publication opcode). We also needed to reform the JUMP mechanics a little to make our VM JIT-compile-friendly so that we can get massive speedups. Both of these required some rearchitecting come PoC7 time.
2. Setting up the hubs in Berlin and Amsterdam took longer than we expected, as did hiring people. Both problems are past us now, and our teams are quite decently sized.
3. We wanted to add proof of stake and an ALARM opcode into 1.0, but we decided to leave both for 1.1 so that 1.0 can come out faster so that is no longer a substantial delaying factor.

I AGREE!!!
So, actually from your comment I can quite reasonably I was misquoted, at least _in spirit_ - I absolutely never had in mind when writing any of that the idea that the Bitcoin supply algorithm should be changed, and yet everyone is interpreting it that way. I only advocate for a new currency to be built via the stabilized model, and for Bitcoin to stay as it is.
Also, did I even mention Ethereum in there? Ethereum is a general-purpose platform for building cool decentralized stuff, we don't even touch flexible monetary policy at platform level; everything I wrote is actually an even greater advertisement for Bitshares X with their market pegging scheme and all that.

So the combination attacks found by Courtois often work even if you use every address exactly once. That was his point.
As for the larger remark, I would argue the risk is greater on sigs than on privkeys. Privkeys are generated only once (in an HD wallet at least) and sigs thousands of times. Since bad RNGs are often only probabilistically bad, this is a major difference.

No, I do not. If I did, I would advocate centralized control by wise philosopher kings. Such a system would continue failing until some set of WPKs came along which are actually wise, at which point it would hopefully succeed as a metastable equilibrium because the WPKs would be able to find other wise people to continue replacing them; that's the best you can do in such a circumstance. I hold the idea that human nature is usually good (formally, the quantity of altruistic people is above zero, substantial, and much greater than the quantity of anti-altruistic people), but centralized power (1) corrupts, and (2) attracts the already corrupt, so decentralization is a better solution where possible. Where impossible, second-bests include dynamism (ie. people rise and fall fast, eg. the tech startup scene) and quasi-decentralization via formal democracy.

Several points on that:
1. Amir is not distinguishing between left-libertarians (eg. Proudhon) and right-libertarians (eg. Cody Wilson). Many people refer to right-libertarians as "libertarians" and left-libertarians as "anarchists", but Amir is making the legitimate terminological choice not to phrase the distinction in this way.
2. Wanting to keep something anonymous and uncensored is a libertarian position, even if many people who support that libertarian position also support other positions that are conservative, liberal, authoritarian, progressive, primitivist, etc. There is nothing wrong with holding certain libertarian positions even if your dominant ideology is something else, just like with the reverse - it shows that you are willing to think for yourself.
3. The evidence that Amir provides does show that a large portion of the claimed ostracism is specifically against "libertarians", as opposed to privacy advocates in general.

We will hold BTC primarily because (1) we think it's more likely to go up than down, (2) it's easier to pay employees in BTC, and (3) if it does go down hard then that's a partial indicator that the crypto space as a whole has become less appealing so our project is less useful anyhow.
I've expressed a few times that I'm bearish on the prospect of Bitcoin seriously upgrading its technology unless some quantum computing-level emergency happens; that applies to Ethereum contracts, CryptoNote ring signatures, Zerocash anonymity, tree chains, proof of stake algorithms and any other big area of innovation. That's probably a good thing; BTC is digital gold, not a generalized do-everything crypto-monopolist (even Ethereum is not trying to be a do-everything crypto-monopolist), and it should be conservative because it's holding billions of dollars of capital and people would get quite angry if it tried to implement any of those features and the network ended up crashing as a result.

There was no politics involved here; that never came into my thinking. I just dislike unjustified complacency. Yes, I have a consistent stance of believing that "cryptocurrency 2.0" is the future and not "cryptocurrency 1.0", and am public about this and stand up and speak out about my associated controversial stances (namely, (1) premines and presales are awesome and actually increase fairness, though should be implemented carefully, (2) we need better algorithms, (3) hardline deflationism is suboptimal for a currency, (4) we need better issuance models, (5) free-market economics works great if and only if implemented correctly, so you can't just leave everything alone and assume that you'll get the optimal result). However, beyond that I have been very careful about using speaking time that I have been given for free to promote the industry (decentralized applications, zero infrastructure, hard problems of cryptocurrency) and not my own project to a large extent, even to the point that people literally tell me "why didn't you talk more about Ethereum?".

To be fair, even Bitcoin meetups are quite diverse compared to Bitcoin conferences. I think it's the lack of an affordable ticket option that's the big problem. If conferences would locate themselves close to major university campuses, make a $20 expo-only option, and market themselves to students, I think the demographics would get much more interesting. Bitcoin expo is doing a very good job of 2 out of 3, but its marketing to students is lacking - but that's something that I think we all need to work on.
Also, I would not focus on race so much as on the type of person. Although neither is at all desirable, I would rather be part of a conference with a specific white-male-only policy (or whatever other similar restriction) and genuine diversity everywhere else than a theoretically non-discriminatory event but with an astronomically high price that de facto ended up consisting of a bunch of middle-eastern, Asian and south American millionaire VCs and investors.

No. The best solution is to merge mine small overlapping subsets, so each node only needs to know about a few blockchains but they still all secure each other in the long term. Another approach is to have each miner be a full client on one chain and a light client on the other 63, using a challenge-response protocol (this idea is most formally described in [BP2]( for Ethereum and was independently invented under the name ["proof of treachery"]( in Bitcoin) to police the other chains. As for extremely rapid chains, you would probably only merge-mine every thousand blocks.

Here's one of the more interesting ideas I've seen lately for how a price-stabilized currency could actually be implemented: 
But it requires a decentralized estimator of the price in order to work, and those are hard. If you don't like schellingcoin, my endogenous bounded diff-based price estimator can work moderately well at detecting big jumps:


    if D[i] / D[i-1] &gt; 2:    
        P[i] = P[i-1] * D[i] / D[i-1] / 2    
    elif D[i] / D[i-1] &lt; 1:    
        P[i] = P[i-1] * D[i] * D[i-1]   
    else:    
        P[i] = P[i-1]

I would argue:
1. Many people are concerned that centralized stock markets are rigged in favor of well-connected HFT firms. Decentralized markets alleviate this threat, so people might prefer to trade on markets that are decentralized.
2. " not everyone in a network needs to verify that a trade I was involved in went through" &lt;- this argument applies exactly as much to stocks and money, as do most of the other arguments you raise in that paragraph. Both are digital assets, so both require network consensus in order to maintain ownership.
3. Once the technology becomes more advanced, you'll have companies that operate on the blockchain directly. In that case, it simply makes the most sense for the ownership unit to be blockchain-based as well.
I see money protocols and stock protocols to be very similar, and therefore have roughly the same needs. Ordinary people tend to make larger, and slower, trades, and for these cases the blockchain is just fine, but in some cases you want micropayments, privacy or speed, and then a channel-based or centralized solution might be the most useful.

What's the relevance to cryptocurrency here?
@_date: 2014-11-02 11:08:30


So, let's run through this more carefully. Suppose that the Chinese government wants to attack the Bitcoin network. They could conceivably have one of several motives:
1. They don't like cryptocurrency because of { terrorism, belief in economic theories arguing that the existence of unregulated financial tools will lead to extreme financial instability, desire to remove deflationary alternatives to fiat, desire to keep their banks in power, desire to support their own state-backed crypto }
2. They want to profit from shorting it
3. They are fine with cryptocurrency, but want control so that they can censor transactions
(2) seems silly, particularly so since any government-scale attempt to profit by shorting-then-attacking (or conversely longing-then-promoting) anything will collapse in on itself due to insider trading. In fact, insider trading will warn us ahead of time that "something big and bad is going to happen soon" regardless of CNgov's motives. Thus, ruling out (2), we are left with two motives that are basically both hostile to Bitcoin proper.
Now, CNgov wants to attack. They have the addresses and identities of 50%+ of the Bitcoin network. They have two options:
1. Seize the hardware
2. Just send them a secret court order NSA-style to install a given software package
(1) I agree will provide early warning; (2) will not do so directly, but as mentioned above attempts to keep it secret will probably collapse in on themselves due to insider trading (particularly, note that Chinese BTC exchanges often let you invest in them, and a sudden hostile stance on BTC would be much worse for those exchanges than for Bitcoin proper, and the insider trading should hurt them even more; all this will be a relatively easily detectable signal).
So, status: (1) CNgov has control of 60% of mining hardware, (2) the world is aware that "something bad is gonna happen in China". Now, CNgov starts their attack. Suppose the current block number is 323515. The software states "add an extra validity rule that a block is valid iff (i) block.number &lt;= 323515, OR (ii) the block contains 0 transactions that have not been signed by CNgov". Thus, the CNgov-controlled miners will create a chain of empty blocks, and this chain will inevitably eventually defeat any competing chain that contains non-empty blocks.
So, Bitcoin community sees this, decides to fork. In order to render the CNgov ASIC control meaningless, they would need to switch to something other than SHA256. Now, in a single-chain environment that's not too bad; just a few software installs for everyone, although merchants everywhere would experience days of disruption. However, the consensus seems to be that multiple interacting chains is the future, even if we have disagreements over whether the architecture will be centralized at the inter-chain level (ie. Bitcoin is the center of everything) or decentralized (ie. all chains in a roughly power-law-distributed fashion linking to each other with no chain particularly more central than any other).
Hence, suppose that Bitcoin needs to switch from SHA256 to SHA3 (or hashimoto, or slasher, or hell why not DPOS). Then, sidechains that verify transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain will also need to hard-fork to substitute the Bitcoin validator inside of them with a new Bitcoin validator that supports the new algo, and the effect could propagate recursively.
Now, if the sidechain validators were designed in such a way that a large consensus of users could modify their code _inside_ the protocol, then that could be a way out, and will at least prevent a situation where Bitcoin gets forked, and then Ethereum decides to fork because people decide the BTC sidechain currency inside of Ethereum is too valuable to let die, and then everyone building internet-of-things tech into their fridges on top of Ethereum has to do a recall, but it will still be a very large effort that could take weeks to properly resolve itself.
And then if (1) my hunch that ASIC resistance is possible is incorrect (~50% chance imo) and (2) my hunch that if ASIC resistance is impossible then we'll soon see the development of smart compilers that let you create an ASIC for any algo within 2 weeks, and it will all be centralized in China, is correct, then China could just do it again and again. So it's really all just a question of how large the incentive is.

That's the part that futarchy solves. If you treat politicians' income as shares in a prediction market of the future success of their policies, then politicians will be able to gain income today by selling them on the market.

All monetization schemes fragment. Look at Facebook. Everyone wants to have a network effect, and then lock in. Currency-based monetization, however, doesn't really fragment all that much relative to others, and I think most of the effect can be abstracted away entirely - many users will not even realize that there are all these different cryptotokens behind the platforms they are using.
Also, as far as fragmentation goes, I think the relevant criterion in terms of fragmentation is looking at how easy it is to interface between different platforms. Can you have decentralized apps on chain A that can directly talk to decentralized apps on chain B in a cryptographically secure, trust-free way? Having different currencies on A and B actually doesn't change this equation all that much. Being on different blockchains does, but it's mandatory for scalability reasons (even future versions of Ethereum will eventually move to a connected-multi-chain paradigm).


Developers have to get paid. Hence, in the absence of floating tokens, we have either:
1. Volunteer efforts. Shown to be usually insufficient, see Diaspora.
2. Fees automatically sent to developers (I heard a rumor that BlockStream is pursuing this approach). As mentioned above, I think that charging monopolistic fees is more harmful to users than the floating token approach.
To some it all up, I think the primary question we should be trying to answer is, how do we bring the ugliness / monetization ratio as low as possible? My belief as a pragmatist who cares about users and understands the realities of development is that making new tokens is the least-bad approach for many applications.

Checkpoint providers are a far less capital-intensive industry than software developers, and unlike software developers you can easily do a majority vote among checkpoint providers. And I really don't see a realistic scenario that involves checkpoint providers all maliciously colluding on an incorrect hash, and even if that is possible you still have to go around bribing all the old holders of the coin to give you their private keys.
I would stick to the following claim pretty strongly: given any argument that can possibly be levied against checkpoint providers in PoS, that same argument can be applied to software developers in either system, and its consequences would be three times worse.

[Assassination markets]( are the obvious example. With the way assassination markets are designed (as prediction markets on a person's death, so the assassin can "predict" his victim's death perfectly and win), the system can potentially be decentralized to a very large extent. Although some people, including the creator of the idea Jim Bell, see assassination markets as a liberating tool, allowing people to target harmful politicians for assassination, I think the idea is very problematic - in the case of a politician who oppresses millions of poor people, but each one only slightly, paying for his death will likely not succeed due to a [public goods problem]( whereas if you dare offend one powerful concentrated interest the situation gets bleak very fast.
The one ingredient of assassination markets that cannot be done entirely "in the cloud" is providing the information of who died when; this still requires a centralized agency. For this reason I think we'll see governments passing a law against running a cryptographically signed data feed of people's deaths; this will remove the use case of blockchain-based self-executing wills without major caveats but oh well. Even today if any such group starts up it will likely get shut down and its owners charged under some "aiding and abetting" clause. Anonymous organizations running such feeds will have too much incentive to steal people's money by defrauding the market (put money down on a bunch of people dying on a certain day, let others put their money down, and then release a false feed that that everyone died on that day and take everyone's money), so in practice I don't think we'll see a single reliable market stay standing, just like the "[Tor wallet]( industry.

In the above code it basically is a race. I suspect professional dropbox storers would have a direct connection to some large mining pools in exchange for a fee.
I suppose you can make it an on-blockchain subscriber system, where nodes can "sign up" to store specific files and then need to show that they can fetch any branch with 90%+ uptime every few hours to keep getting rewarded or else they get thrown off the list for that file. That would also work nicely since you can transition into downloading the files directly from those nodes that have shown a track record of high uptime and use some payment protocol with them.

SCIP proof aren't quite like that. They're not just outputs, they're proofs that you actually carried out the complete computation, including the private key, the nonce, and the standard process for calculating a function from them in order to get the output. So they are also implicitly ZK proofs of knowledge that you actually have the key.

The strangers may be unregulated in the formal sense, but they're definitely not "unidentifiable". You can have whatever opinion you want on whether or not it's actually viable, but reputation systems are probably the one thing that people trying to replace government regulators talk about _the most_. The other comment that advocates of such systems make is that in a reputation system I can set up an entity whose sole purpose is to check driver's licenses and assign a trust score of 100% to drivers who have them and -100% to those who don't, and you can assign 100% trust to me and viola you have your license filtering back.

@_date: 2014-11-14 07:26:35




That sounds like something in the general class of schemes that involve "minimal PoW by default, maximal PoW when an alarm is triggered". Your cartel-based version makes me a bit uncomfortable because of (1) slippery-slope risks that the political apparatus will coopt the cartel and make it serve an unwanted enforcement function, (2) the fact that you're creating a monopolist, and the monopolist has an incentive to charge monopoly rent, potentially bringing transaction fees all the way back up to 2.9%. The monopoly rent is bounded as you say, which is a good thing, but it would be a constant policing challenge and may bring back many of the flaws of the current (as in, centralized) system.
However, a similar algorithm that's more formalized into a protocol could maybe work.
For example, suppose that we make the economic assumption that willingness to mine has very high elasticity (false in an ASIC mining situation, true with CPU mining, another reason why I harp on about ASIC-resistant PoW a lot), ie. a 2x increase in the mining reward will bring in 10x more miners _in the short term_ (in the long term, 10x more miners will of course push up the difficulty, and so most of the new miners will be again pushed out, and we'll be left with something like 1.8x as many miners getting 2x the reward, but we assume attacks will not last longer than the difficulty). Then, we make a blockchain with a PoW scheme with the following rules:
1. 90% of the coin is pre-mined/pre-sold/allocated to holders of a few previous coins/whatever
2. The remaining 10% is mined according to Bitcoin's reward schedule.
3. When you make a block, you are allowed to "include" a block that's not from the main chain as an "uncle". When you do this, the score of your block stays the same, but you get 90% of the uncle's reward (the uncle gets nothing). Essentially, this like like (ethereum's version of) GHOST, but backwards
4. We do not automatically assume that the longest fork wins; rather, we use _exponential subjective scoring_ at b=0.6 to punish the score of a fork (basically, this means that if, from a node's point of view, a fork of a chain gets created from N blocks behind the latest block, then everything in that fork from that point on gets penalized by a factor of 0.6^N )
So what do we have? (1) and (2) ensure that the mining reward is 10x lower by default, so there will be 10x less mining waste. However, when an attacker launches a fork, even if the attacker's fork gets longer in the short term, miners on the main chain can start including the attacker's blocks, making their mining reward 1.9x higher temporarily. The attacker can obviously do the same, so it's an even match, but the reward on both sides is temporarily boosted 1.9x, so ~10x as many miners find it economically attractive to join in. The subjective scoring rule heavily penalizes the attacking fork, so the miners have the incentive to join in on the original fork and not the attacking fork.
(Note that we can get rid of the ESS if we are willing to accept a multi-hour-long confirmation time to give sideline miners enough time to turn their machines online in response to the attack)
You can probably think a little harder to figure out some clever way to make things even better.
Resource-based economy is interesting, but I find it a bit non-rigorous in the sense that it doesn't seem to specify exactly what mechanism distributes the resources; as Hayek points out, that's actually the crux of the problem and why "efficient" centralized allocation mechanisms usually end up failing.

So, there's a tradeoff between anonymity and reputation no matter what you do. If you maintain a persistent reputation, that by definitions means that you are linking your transactions together in some way. Advances cryptography might be able to mitigate that to some extent via zero-knowledge proofs (prove that you simultaneously have private key A, and private keys B1 ... Bn which have some reputation attached, and sign further messages with that particular counterparty with key A) but it's a tough problem.

So, here's another way to look at the issue. In order for a blockchain voting system to be secure, it has to have the no-double-voting property. Hence, given votes V1 and V2 from the same party there must be either (1) a public algorithm for detecting that, or (2) an algorithm for summing votes which magically ignores doubles. (1) and (2) are equivalent, since you can check if aggregate(others + V1) == aggregate(others + V1 + V2). Then, all you need to prove that you voted V is a SCIP proof that you can construct V2 such that V and V2 trigger a double-voting condition.

Correct. To expand on this, each block also contains the state tree (our equivalent of the "UTXO set"), so that's where the state information gets passed on from block to block.


We will end up having some kind of RAM regardless of what we do. However, you should keep in mind that the computations to fill up more than about a megabyte of RAM will take thousands of dollars in fees, so economics puts a softcap on how large memory usage can get.

Read the source code I gave above. If you are getting mining data from one trusted source, then every call to `UTXO[b,i]` is necessarily a network call with something like 200ms latency, which is much slower than a 20μs (or whatever it is) database access

There is also another problem: when a miner is checking whether a transaction is valid, it needs to have the entire set of UTXOs to make sure it's not a double spend. If it doesn't, then you have to rely on challenge-response games ("hey, network and/or list of semi-trusted peers, does anyone see a transaction spending 0db768ac2...? Going once.... going twice... okay, looks legit to me!"), which are necessary in a lot of scalability protocols but nevertheless introduce fragility and so should be approached very carefully.

There are two sets of users that are processing your transaction:

It is hypothetically possible to have a society (this is an abstract argument, I'm making no comments on our present real world) where it is true, and people correctly believe, that inflationary currencies are good for society. In such a situation, deflationary currencies would be subject to social scorn, negative PR, and unwillingness on the part of many merchants to accept them. Hence, the inflationary currency will simply end up being more useful and have a more stable value due to its larger size.
So if one agrees with the premise that inflationary currencies are indeed a good thing, then there are non-delusional reasons why individuals will want to adopt them. If that premise is false, then yes it would have to be Keynesian disinfo.

I agree. I'm just pointing out that there's no way in which XCP has less secure unconfirmed transactions, because all unconfirmed transactions are roughly equally insecure.


You can spend funds in account A without making a tx containing a signed output belonging to A as one of its inputs? If you are correct, then I'll accept that as a flaw in the current XCP protocol, but that sounds unlikely to me; when I researched MSC at least the protocol specifically looked to the address of input 0 of a transaction to determine the sender.


1 fee vs 2, fine I'll grant that, though I eventually expect there to be market makers placing orders that concern themselves with large quantities of funds so the $0.05 fee will be insignificant for them compared to the percentage fees they would otherwise be paying, and users would end up usually paying only one fee to accept orders.

Those are a subset of security and consumer protection, and we're already talking about those issues separately.


The bug you linked is a pretty new class of attack; up until now most attacks have focused on actually stealing private keys, and 2FA+multisig is a near-perfect solution to that problem. The solution to this problem is a secure application environment, combined with the 2FA method actually providing information about the transaction. An on-blockchain name-registration scheme will also help. KryptoKit, for example, is not vulnerable at all to the Chrome extension because chrome extensions have separate localstorage.


Personal experience. I've only ever once been or seen anyone be in a position to benefit from a chargeback in real life, and even there it turned out to be unnecessary. Also, there's plenty of economic theory and empirical evidence showing that reputations matter a lot, especially in the context of mainstream businesses.

Ethereum supports side chains out-of-the-box. Anyone can create an asset on Ethereum with an arbitrary issuance policy, and we'll probably help write some of the software libraries to make that easier on the Ethereum side. So you can create an asset that's 2-way-pegged to bitcoin, dogecoin, nxt (though maybe not bitshares, since DPOS as it stands might be a bit too "subjective" to prove itself to other blockchains), whatever you want. Ethereum can basically become a sidechain to every centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency under the sun. There are also mechanisms that you can use to abstract away the process of paying for dapps and transaction fees, so it looks to you as if you're paying for them directly in whatever asset you prefer.


Indeed. But be sure to inversely apply the [planning fallacy]( to get a more realistic answer on all sides.

The answer is that it's a 1-of-n trust model: as long as at least one person exists who is smart enough to point out flaws, that person, upon finding a flaw, can construct an efficient proof (eg. "hey guys, what's with this 'if the signing pubkey is 04bc7124... then don't bother checking the unspent outputs' code in the transaction engine?") that something is wrong, which even moderately smart people will be able to check and verify. And at that point the set of people smart enough to understand the issue is large enough that it sort of just works.

So, suppose there exist ledgers A, B  and C, which are the only ledgers and collude to block WikiLeaks. They also happen to be the ledgers used by Coinbase, BCI and BitPay. Miners are a highly decentralized market; everyone either does it on their desktop because we switched to a good ASIC-resistant proof of work or my backup theory is correct and it's optimal to put the machines in people's homes for heating purposes
Now, a company comes along and opens ledger D, which does not block WikiLeaks. First off, if ledger D tries to charge for access, then it is at an immediate disadvantage to ledgers A, B and C, which are free because their fixed costs are paid for by a big company. Let's say that this does not happen because D is backed by some unrelated business (eg. Circle suddenly becomes to become libertarian for some reason and create their own node that does not participate in censorship).
Now, suppose that most miners switch to D as per your theory. Eventually, these miners include a block which contains a Wikileaks transaction, and ledgers A, B and C block that block, so the chain state in D is different from the chain state common across A, B and C. There is now a fork. However, what matters is not miners but users. Coinbase, Bitpay and BCI control the majority of the users, and the rest of the users want to be on a chain that is compatible with them. Hence, all the users stay on A, B and C. Additionally, the miners on D get no bitcoins that anyone else recognizes. In fact, anticipating this, miners would never even switch to D in the first place.
Also note that this failure mode applies even if anyone can have a ledger; all that matters is that Coinbase, Bitpay and BCI have a majority of users.

There is an extreme fallacy being made here - namely, that marginal cost == total cost. How is this relevant to PoS? So, there are two ways that you can expend resources to benefit more from PoS. The first, as Paul describes, is that stakeholders can try producing lots and lots of different blocks to find blocks that are favorable to themselves. In a well-designed PoS algo, this is outright information-theoretically impossible, since determining which kind of block would select you as a future voter relies on future information. In less well-designed, but still decent, algos, you can increase your probability with exponential effort. Hence, we can make a table as follows:
      VOTING PROB | TOTAL COST | MARGINAL COST
      ----------------------------------------
      0           | 0          | 0
      20          | 1          | 1
      21          | 2          | 1
      22          | 4          | 2
      23          | 8          | 4
      ...         | ...        | ...
      30          | 1024       | 512
      31          | 2048       | 1024
Now, suppose that one unit of voting probability is worth 500 units of value to you. Then, you have the incentive to crank up your voting probability to 30. So what are the results? You've done 1024 work, and you've gained 15000 value. Even though marginal cost == marginal revenue, total cost == total revenue * 0.07. And with well-designed algos marginal cost flips straight from zero to infinite, so the total cost is actually near-zero.
Now, the other kind of "work" that you can do in PoS is sacrifice more of your stake into the long-term deposit voting pool, sacrificing liquidity. However, here we have two points:
1. Marginal cost vs total cost just as above; most people would suffer almost zero from parking 70% of their coins, but would see a break-even point at ~80-90%, so total cost / total revenue &lt; 0.1, just as above.
2. Locking up capital increases the value of the remaining coins which are distributed among all users, so the liquidity is actually from a social viewpoint redistributed and not sacrificed. This is a public good, so standard economic analysis that other people will pay you for giving them that liquidity so you will add even more stake until MR actually == MC does not apply. Note that the effect here, using a public good as a sort of trapdoor to break the equivalence between marginal social return and marginal individual cost, is a very important trick in cryptoeconomics.
Finally, note that proof of stake is not meant to be as secure as the reward; it's meant to be as secure as the slasher security deposit, which can be much higher than the reward. So that's also another way that (good) PoS does an end run around this particular concern.


Solved by weak subjectivity (sounds like I really need to write a blog post properly explaining what weak subjectivity is at some point...)


Umm... token sale? Proof of burn? Snapshot? 


Mining has exactly the same deficiencies, except on a longer time scale: past 2040, there will be no more mining distribution, and so mining disproportionately favors people who were alive before then. The only solution to this problem is to make mining permanently issue N coins per year; in fact rather ironically this was the planned distribution model for Ethereum back when we were convinced we would be PoW forever, and yet I seem to have utterly failed in my mission to convince this community that such permanent linear distribution is a more fair and correct model.


Sure. It actually is also my stance that one-time token sales are a highly imperfect model, and I would much prefer a coin that issues out units of itself to pay for ongoing development a la [futarchycoin]( or DPOS.
My own fundamental theory about PoS is this: PoS in principle is likely to be superior because it has a much higher sub-choice dimensionality. PoW is PoW; you can do ASIC-resistant algos, you can do useful algos, you can go GHOST, but the fundamental workings don't really change (the only really serious modification to PoW I've seen is one that I've invented myself (and maybe others before me, not sure), namely [TaPoW]( With PoS, however, you're basing your consensus mechanism on something which is inside the protocol and hence controlled by the protocol, giving you a much larger set of options to choose from, including security deposits, randomly selecting voters for each block from a much larger set, arbitrary punishment mechanisms, blockmaker-driven PoS versus Pebble-style leader-free PoS versus TaPoS, etc. There are two versions of PoW, and billions of versions of PoS. So you need to have a very strong argument in favor of PoW in order to show that the right algo out of a billion and two is one of the two PoW ones.

So interestingly enough, that's not strictly true. If a sidechain becomes too unpopular, then it will become insecure, and attackers could repeatedly double-spend it to drain its reserve in the parent chain. So if you are interested in a chain to hold your BTC on long-term and forget about them, then sidechains don't actually give you the indifference property in the black-swan case.

Nah, he's kinda correct. A sidechain is a chain that contains a currency two-way-pegged to some other currency from another network (typically BTC).

It actually complies with the regression theorem perfectly. All that the theorem states is that currency has to have had value for some other reason before it became a currency.

Also, the creditors in question here never signed any forms and were not under the understanding that they were making a risky investment, they deposited money into an exchange which implicitly claimed to be secure and not a fractional reserve (that's "implicitly claim" in the same way that a restaurant implicitly claims that its food is food and not poison); big difference.

That's true for bitcoin proper, but the security actually does become quite a bit weaker when sidechains get involved. If chain B is a sidechain of chain A, **from the point of view of chain A**, all the coins "in" chain B are seen as "owned" by a script on chain A which can be viewed as "controlled" by the fork of chain B with greatest hashpower. Chain A **does not** evaluate the "full" rules of chain B; it only evaluates the "longest proof of work" rules. So if you can 51% attack chain B, you can in fact either (i) give yourself coins out of nowhere on chain B, and import them into chain A until chain B's "bank account" on chain A is completely drained, de-facto "stealing" everyone else's coins on chain B, or (ii) take out your own coins from chain B honestly, then double spend chain B to get your coins back on chain B, and repeat (with the same eventual result of stealing all the chain B coins). This is why blockstream is so concerned with getting mining pools signed up to merge-mine sidechains.

Right, so short-haul refusals are probably a result of a suboptimal price structure which makes short hauls uneconomical and long hauls economical. I suspect the issue is that for simplicity taxi companies want to stick to a "X + Y per kilometer" model, but the problem is that if a taxi is in a city, the cost of taking on a ride is ~x + d, where x is a static transaction cost and d is distance, since once a cab is done a ride it can immediately start looking for other rides, but in an airport for short-haul rides it's ~x + 2d, since the taxi needs to drive back to the airport with no passengers. For long-haul rides you're in the city center and so can get other rides not from the airport quickly, so there is no drive-back requirement and the cost is ~x + d again, whereas for short-haul rides the airport is a nearby point with a much higher concentration of passengers than anywhere else so you pretty much have to go back there. Hence, any price structure must necessarily either be overpricing long-hauls or underpricing short-hauls, so drivers go for underpricing short-hauls and then refusing them. At least that's my immediate 5-minute take as an armchair economist. Smartphone apps can resolve the issue by providing a built-in calculator that allows much more complex price structures that take this into account to be viable, as consumers can immediately see the final cost of going from point A to point B even if the underlying formula is incredibly complex.
Poor treatment of passengers - well, once you have a passenger in your car, there is no market incentive to be more nice to them, so quite expected. So review/rating systems can help solve that particular issue. However I do disagree with Uber's approach of kicking drivers off if they fall below 4.5, as there is plenty of market room for cheaper rides that compromise on quality in exchange for lower prices; so there maybe is market room for decentralized-Uber to take this niche (I suspect the main challenge will be that people think in terms of brands, and so there are reputational externalities on the platform if a passenger accepts a $4.70 ride across the city that ends upgoing horribly wrong; the solution will probably involve marketing the service as a form of _generic public infrastructure_, like the internet, and not as a brand).


So, let's explore this. Initially, there is supply S and price P for taxis, with an occupancy rate O. Then, deregulation comes in, and prices jump up to P' &gt; P due to blah blah blah imperfect information, local micro-monopoly effects, etc. Now, drivers are only willing to stay on the roads if they earn at least $x per day, ie. if P * O &gt; $x. Seeing P go up, we have P' * O &gt;&gt; $x, so more drivers are willing to get on the roads. Hence, S goes up, pushing O down and pushing P a bit down until we have P' * O' = $x again. Basically, P going up pushes O down, pushing the equilibrium point even further up in terms of P. So the second argument isn't really a separate argument by itself, it's simply a weird spare-capacity effect that exacerbates the increase in P caused by the original imperfect-information problem, so solving the first problem would solve the second.

I would have granted this to you one year ago, but now things have actually [moved forward]( quite [a lot](


There are ways to do this with Bitcoin, that I talk about in the linked article. Also, I find that if you stay within the lines of mainstream commerce, the chance you'll ever use a chargeback with credit cards or cry about the lack of a chargeback with standard Bitcoin transactions is quite low. If you're going off the beaten path and transacting with other people directly, then there are plenty of specialized marketplaces for that in the Bitcoin space, even going into industries that Paypal would not even let you participate in at all.
Personally, I think the only real downsides left for BTC are (i) volatility and (ii) lack of mainstream adoption. (i) is hard I admit; the solution seems to involve either financial derivatives/hedging or, in the long term, bank or government-issued cryptocurrencies, and (ii) will just have to solve itself over time.

Blockchain-based elections cannot provide a secret ballot property (basically, if a vote has been published, you can prove that you voted at the very least by providing a SCIP proof that you are capable of producing a vote exactly byte-for-byte equal to the vote on the chain). More complicated constructions like secret sharing DAOs may work though.

Correct. But the whole magic of ESS is that for that to lead to a fork in the long term, the two chains will have to stay within 1.67^N x of each other forever. So, okay, if you have 10-50% of mining power you can spend millions of dollars to permanently knock a few stupid nodes out of whack. Whoopdedoo. 


There are others; Peter Todd considers centralization a huge problem for one, to the point that he even sold 50% of his coins over it. Also quite a few altcoin developers.
I used to think that everything is fine and the problems would magically resolve themselves as well. I think many people, including previously myself, just naturally fall into that mindset because they see Bitcoin as the only alternative to the "centralized system" and have a sort of [arguments-as-soldiers]( desire to defend it, whereas the correct mindset to have is "what would you do if you were starting from scratch?".

I would argue there are very substantial differences in (1) where they compromise, and (2) in their prescriptions toward non-governmental entities (eg. "we don't need welfare because without regulation/crowding-out effects charity would be good enough" vs "we don't need welfare because charity-like things are counterproductive and make people weak" are both positions held by some libertarians, but they have very different implications to whether or not people should participate in charity). And in a world of limited government, prescriptions toward non-governmental entities are everything.

From an economic standpoint, this isn't really a bad thing; it increases the value of everyone else's coins. This is an instance of the [seen vs unseen]( fallacy - it feels warm and fuzzy that individuals' coins go to their relatives, but if no one does it then everyone's coins "go to" everyone's relatives anyway due to deflation. So the limbo-forever approach may be more socially beneficial because is has lower bureaucracy (although that assumes fully trustworthy businesses; otherwise it does create some systemic risks as you have centers that are in control of a very large quantity of funds that they have the opportunity to pilfer without anyone finding out). A third alternative is for exchanges to set their own "if you don't use your account for 5 years the funds go to us" policy, the long-term effect of which is to reduce fees, perhaps even to zero because exchanges will know that they may be able to survive entirely by monetizing people's carelessness.

A given privkey has a chance of 1 / 2^160 of corresponding to a particular address, hence a 1 - 1 / 2^160 chance of _not_ corresponding to that address. There are 2^256 privkeys. Hence, the chance that all privkeys do not correspond to a given address A is (1 - 1 / 2^160)^2^256 . Since (1 - 1/n)^n ~= 1/e for high n, that simplifies to ((1 - 1 / 2^160 )^2^160 )^2^96 = 1/e^2^96 . Now, there exist 2^160 addresses, so the probability that there exists an address that corresponds to no private key is 2^160 / e^2^96, or ~e^2^7 / e^2^96, so 1 / e^(2^96 - 2^7) .
Hmm, okay, so 1/e^2^89 was a mistake; it's even smaller.

Let us suppose as a prior that you are a random person who has just heard of bubble X. In general, in this model we assume that bubbles grow by 2x per "period", bringing in 2x new people and doubling the price, until they pop at some point and the price drops to zero. Suppose that in total there are N people who ever will participate in bubble X. We can, without loss of generality, sort them into buckets, with everyone in positions N/2....N being the ones that will participate in the last period, positions N/4....N/2 being the ones that will participate in the second last period, etc. Since it is already known that you are one of the N, your current set of information about yourself is that you are somewhere in this list; and the probability that you are in N/2.....N is 50%. Hence, there is a 50% chance that the phase you are in is the last one - and this is _despite_ a potential 40-phase-long track record of repeated doublings up until that point. Now, if each phase raises the price and attention by 6x, if you redo the math you'll note that there is a 83% chance that you are in the last phase.
So in fact, believing that the current phase is the last **is the correct default position to take**, and that applies to any rapidly growing thing that you just found out about.

That's how we see it, true. But once you go out into the "mainstream" political world, then the idea of being able to send money completely anonymously at all is definitely, at least by more traditional people, seen as absolute madness. So he's right on the mark there.


Fully agree. but taking a charitable interpretation of the arguments being made by the anti-Coinbase/Circle side, they might be expressing the fear that such companies will pressure the core Bitcoin developers (or just plain outcompete them) to add anti-privacy features into the clients, or worse the core protocol. I don't think this is too likely to happen though.


I'm with Cody here. In his view, Bitcoin's promises are (i) hyper-efficient money, and (ii) truly private money. The "Bitcoin establishment", in his view, will give us (i) but not (ii), which I actually agree with. Dark Wallet, on the other hand, will provide the first major, usable tool that allows us to actually achieve (ii). His position is right on the mark from a "positive freedom" standpoint.


Agreed in this case. OTOH, there are actual serious threads, like Coinvalidation. There's probably a line to be drawn here somewhere.


Also, from my own experience, it's a rather unwarranted statement that Silicon Valley/Coinbase/the core developers are evil. I remember when I visited Coinbase back in November one of the employees actually proudly told me that donated some money to the DW funding campaign. Greg Maxwell (on Reddit) from the dev team has come up with some good ideas to support privacy including his original work on CoinJoin which Amir and Cody are ultimately working off of.

Contracts have to pay computation fees regardless of whether they fully execute. If a contract doesn't have the reserve to pay to fully execute its script, then it simply does as much as it can before going to zero and then stops, like a car out of gas on the highway. If you then try to activate the contract again, it stops pretty much immediately because it has no ether left.

_Actually_, the bitcoin network has more sha256ing power than the top 500 supercomputers combined. By that metric, a block of wood has vastly more computational power than any computer made by humans; it's only a minor detail that that power is only useful for the one specific purpose of determining what position each of the molecules is going to be at the next instant in time. I would say SHA256 asics are philosophically closer to the wood than the general purpose devices.
It's a heck of a lot of hashing, but I don't think it's really accurate to call it a super-powerful computational engine of any sort.

Here I agree with you on the existence of the effect, but I disagree on the underlying moral theory. It's not Bitcoin maximalism that is the primary cause, it's the ideology that uninnovative copycat coins are bad. As evidence I will submit the public response to Stellar, which is an uninnovative copycat of Ripple, and which got pretty roundly criticized around these parts (and around the non-maximalist parts of the community as well).


I'd disagree there. Let S = store-of-value usage, T = transactional usage and N = non-financial usage of cryptocurrency technology. I care about maximizing S + T + N. The market cap, however, is more like 100S + T + 0.01N (since market cap is proportional to cash holdings demand at any particular time, desire to hold cash for a really long time (ie. SoV demand) has a wildly disproportionate influence, and non-financial usage only pays transaction fees). So it is entirely possible to imagine two futures A and B, where in A the market cap is $30 billion, in B it's $900 million, and yet we would both prefer B to A because A is all S whereas B has much more T and N.


This I will grant, although with the proviso that it provides increased security against external entities but not internal entities. We're still vulnerable to a collusion of three mining pools or 5-10 ASIC companies and will be nearly equally so at $4 billion or $400 billion.


Likely, especially in the long term.


But this I would disagree with; if we are replacing central banks with something I favor the scheme described in Hayek's Denationalization of Money.


Don't you mean _too inflationary_ here?


Hmm, I would have expected a greater influx of VC revenue as VCs would have realized that they could be the ones to get on top of the market cap pile.
In general, I view cryptocurrencies as being kind of like corporations. Sure, they do often replace each other fairly quickly, and that's a good thing. But after the market settles down, there are always companies that manage to last many decades or even centuries. So I'm not worried that there won't be any long-term blockchain at all if Bitcoin loses its throne. This is particularly true if blockchains incorporate DPOS-like mechanisms (perhaps even at an extra-protocol level) to finance their own ongoing development.

There was a whitepaper detailing counter-arguments to the "decentralized prediction markets lead to assassinations" idea. The main ones are:
1. If the voters are marginally moral, they will collude to vote 0 on all death-related bets, making the system useless for those applications.
2. Public assassination markets are actually one of the less convenient ways to pay to kill people, because it gives away the information publicly that someone is being targeted, and so they can take extra precautions*
3. People can also collude with law enforcement to fake their own deaths and split the profits. 
I personally find (1) the most convincing.
**Note:** a stronger version of argument 2 says that assassination markets also reveal exactly when a person is going to be killed, providing even more info. However, this is false; the best way to set up an assassination market is as a bounty where people can make claims of the form "I expect Barack Obama to die within 24 hours of a number hashing to `1aca343fd3bfb596...` being published on the blockchain", giving Barack as little as ten minutes of warning.

So I would posit a different valuation equilibrium: I expect the value of every cryptocurrency to be roughly proportional to the amount of original research and development that goes into it. This equilibrium will be enforced by (1) disproportionately large media attention toward innovative projects, (2) moral pressure on network-effect-providing businesses, (3) self-reinforcing expectations, which cryptocurrencies are based on by definition. This circumvents the standard infinite-number-of-currencies argument against Hayekian currency competition because each new successful currency now requires "proof of work" to create (the work being original R&amp;D) hence production of a new currency (that does not get ignored) is no longer zero-cost. Also while you seem to be worried about Bitcoin crashing to zero I'm actually more worried about the exact opposite outcome: Bitcoin going to $5m. Concern is basically [this]( though a bit less dramatic. The only other major example we have of a fixed-supply zero-risk asset existing as a fundamentally important building block of the economy is land, and history is replete with evidence that land tends to concentrate over time with the result that we ended up with "land reform" movements popping up every few centuries reshuffling everything again. Today we solved the problem only with property taxes. Meanwhile, if we go the multi-currency route, every currency will still go up; there's plenty of room. BTC specifically will just simply go up 500x instead of 10000x.

I am very aware of how colored coins work and what their properties are. Two months ago, I was sitting in the meeting room at Andreessen Horowitz presenting a pitch for a colored coins exchange company alongside several other developers myself, and we would have gotten funding had the team not split up and had I not gone on to build Ethereum instead. The point of this is to say that we didn't just go "hey, let's make a new coin!"; rather, I had been working on projects doing things supposedly "the right way" on top of the good old Bitcoin protocol for 2 months, and it was from those months of thought and experience that it became obvious to me that doing it that way just doesn't cut it.
To answer your points:


In order to be actually secure under this setup, light clients would need to backward scan through a large subset of all transactions of a particular color that ever happened. Once there are millions of transactions of one color, that doesn't sound particularly "light" to me; in fact, if you were to make the "colored coin" an altchain instead, it would be exactly equivalent to a full node.


That's exactly what we're doing with Ethereum! We're expanding the scripting language so that, as one of the applications, you can now easily do colored coins inside of a contract. Now, why aren't we lobbying gmaxwell and Gavin to put our innovations into Bitcoin itself? Because the devs are, for very good reason, incredibly conservative. Bitcoin is an 8 billion dollar train shooting forward at 400 miles per hour, and trying to make substantial changes to the engine on the run is a path that is very likely to lead to disaster. In fact, with the transaction malleability situation, the devs are moving to make the language more restrictive, not less. And it's not going to change. This kind of innovation is best done on its own chain, so that we don't risk billions of dollars of other people's money.


The problem, once again, is that it can't work. While the p2ptrade protocol can do atomic swaps, in order to have a proper exchange you need to have an orderbook - and an enforceable orderbook for the system not to collapse due to spam. Because Bitcoin script is not (and IMO due to the aforementioned developer conservatism never will be) color aware, you can't make a half-signed transaction that says "anyone can get these five green coins in exchange for one blue coin".
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:49:50


Opposition to **parasitism** without innovation would be my one-word change in emphasis. If these were non-financial networks there would be no moral opposition to forks, just "meh, this one has more network effect".


Possible, though not necessary. Gold has high S, low T. Alternatively, as Robert Sams argues, S may even actually crowd out T because S invites more volatility.


I would agree right up to 2013, but less so now. I think that the public knows about cryptocurrency, and what they are waiting for is not so much imagination and interest but rather a useful application, so the marginal value of more front-page headlines is not too high.


Largely agree as I mentioned


Hmm, I actually get a quite different sense, particularly from the sheer number of VCs saying things of the form "it's the blockchain technology, not the currency, that matters" and nobody serious really contradicting them.


I'd argue that it's the success and utility of blockchain technology that will cause the availability of easily accessible distributed currencies, more so than the other way around.
@_date: 2015-01-17 14:12:23
No. I predict a valuation equilibrium similar to the way speculation on art paintings works. Everything naturally fetches a price that is proportional to its salience, because everyone expects that to happen. Cryptocurrencies that add no original value will end up having zero market cap, and so the process of creating new units of cryptocurrency that do have value will require "proof of work" (in this case, substantial original research), so there will not be an infinite supply. The current valuations on coinmarketcap seem to have borne out my theory pretty decently so far.

Correct. If you are trying to peg to an asset that grows by k percent a year, and nothing grows k percent a year in your economy, then you have to have a situation where either there is a negative interest rate to make up the difference or the whole situation is a Ponzi scheme. Bad pegging schemes are schemes that collapse into case (ii), good pegging schemes are schemes that collapse into case (i); this was the foundation of my design of schellingdollar and my criticism of seignorage shares. The three examples from  all seem to be an example of this Ponzi failure mode.
So the question with a monetary policy is, does it perform currency expansion in a way that is irreversible? There are two ways to accomplish this goal. One is to make the central bank actually hold the asset it is pegging to (eg. 0.833 EUR in the CHF case); if this is done, then as long as the central bank is trusted the peg is infallible. However, we crypto people don't like central anything, and it's not possible for a DAO to hold USD or commodities directly. Central banks don't like this approach because it denies them flexibility (they _want_ to be able to break pegs if it suits their other objectives) and because it denies them seignorage revenue. The second approach (actually a superset of the first, but go with me for a second) is to make the currency completely debt-based, ie. all positive balances are matched by negative balances. The result would be that if the economy goes down and some parties cannot pay off their debts, whoever happened to be their creditor would lose money (collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps can be used to manage this risk). The problem comes when the set of debtors is too centralized, as then default of a single debtor breaks the whole system (or poses large systemic risk of doing so, as in the case of an oligopoly of banks all following similar policies).
The idea behind a schellingdollar scheme is to allow anyone to participate on either side of the bargain, either as a holder of stablecoin or as a debtor (using volcoin as collateral), reducing the black swan risk of having a single central bank be the primary debtor. What is particularly interesting is that any volcoin holder can participate in "backing" the currency via arbitrage: instead of holding $X worth of volcoin, hold { $2X worth of volcoin, -X stablecoin } inside the system and X of the underlying asset outside the system. This gives them nice profit opportunities in case of market crashes, as they will have risk-free (relative to their prior position as just volcoin holders) gains via negative interest rates sapping away their negative stablecoin, so the result is that the entire market is effectively hard at work at the task of finding the lowest-possible-risk form of backing for the asset. This removes the potential for seignorage revenue and the cryptoeconomic algorithm is designed not to be mutable for political reasons; this is the fundamental tradeoff that stability gets you.
The only risk left is basically a black swan hole: it works fine because the math says it works fine given continuity assumptions, but it breaks if everything breaks all at once too quickly, or if there exists no real-world asset profile that can maintain anything close to the peg with a low risk. But then just about every non-boring financial construct has that property, including derivative markets under a hypothetical fixed-supply currency :)

So you're actually not the first person that I saw this partially-pegged sidechain proposal from. It seems like an interesting compromise halfway house solution, and I like halfway house compromises in principle as long as they're not ugly. However, unfortunately I see a few reasons why it's not that effective:
1. One of the key touted benefits to sidechains for users is that they share Bitcoin's currency network effects by using the same currency. However, a partially pegged sidechain does not have this advantage; it is rather a floating-rate asset, and so has the same problems as a full-on altcoin.
2. It still has the complexities and risks of an external dependency (namely, bitcoin). For example, if one of my reasons for using ethereum is that it is (eventually) using PoS and I think PoS is good and PoW doomed to failure, then I will be scared that eventually BTC will get attacked and the sidechain economically screwed up as well.
3. It's extra complexity generally.
Hence, partially pegged side-chains seem to have maybe 50% of the benefits of side-chains to users but 100% of the downsides, so unfortunately won't work. Now the one idea I do like is doing a "sharedrop" distribution where 50% of the tokens in a new currency go to holdings of previous currencies that could be said to have been the source of the portion of that ideas in the new currency's blockchain protocol that aren't innovative. This also reduces dilution risk, but without any additional infrastructural complexity at all. ETH obviously skipped this step, but in the long term this would be solved retroactively because any currency that was thinking of sharedropping to ETH can simply redirect 50% of that sharedrop to ETH's ideological progenitors (namely, BTC, MSC, XRP) instead.

This sentence reveals a lot about maximalists to me. You're literally saying that you don't want altcoins to even have **the means** to compete against Bitcoin. You prefer a world where no other project ecosystem even has a fighting chance. Meanwhile I have never said anywhere that sidechains _should not_ be made or that Bitcoin should be inhibited. I've only criticized **maximalism**, precisely because it is an ideology that says that certain other things **should not** be done. Sidechains in general are potentially very useful tech.

Mining power means nothing. If the users agree on a hard fork to mining on SHA3, then it doesn't matter if all the SHA256 miners cry really loudly and refuse to switch and only three users start mining the SHA3; the blocks mined by the SHA256 miners will be considered invalid and therefore ignored by the network and that's that.

It is dangerous for certain things to be controlled automatically without human input; for example, many people strongly oppose zero-tolerance policies in schools and mandatory sentencing minimums in the court system because they remove the opportunity for human judges to take into account the special considerations of each case and reduce penalties for those who obviously do not deserve the statutory minimums.
My answer to this problem is that all of the "decentralized autonomous society" initiatives, whether on our platform or any other, have one major common property, a sort of constitution that can't be broken: your score within the system cannot go below zero. If you get a disease and don't have enough money to pay your debts, maybe the blockchain can take away all of your digital assets (and some physical assets if you have smart property) if you had agreed to use those assets as collateral for your loan, but the blockchain CANNOT send debt collectors to go after you, off you with military helicopters or send you to prison. Theoretically, someone can create a gateway that offers those services, but then that would be a physical business which can, and should, be regulated or shut down as appropriate. On the blockchain, if your situation gets too grim, you always have the option of deleting your account and starting a new one from scratch. I think this digitally enforced "right to a fresh start" may end up being one of the most important human rights of this and the next century.

It's similar to bitcoin in that there's a market-based (but regulated via a floating hard block limit) mechanism for setting the ETH/gas rate (gas basically == one computational step), and so if you try to make an economic model for what the real-value price of 1 unit of gas will be the price of ether will be nowhere in the equation. If the market-equilibrium USD/gas rate is $0.0001/gas, then if ETH is at $0.30 it will be 0.00333 ETH/gas, and if ETH is at $187 it will be 0.000000534 ETH/gas.

The largest problem is that the whole point of sidechains is to build protocols that are more powerful than bitcoin itself, and which potentially have arbitrarily complicated rules.

Agree, the market is nothing close to perfect. But it can be fairly okay. The situation I am reporting isn't some hypothetical fantasy, it's my interpretation of the altcoin scene of today, where, by and large, the value of the top coins actually is proportional to how much they innovate. There is a bias in favor of old coins (PPC and LTC) (which interestingly enough actually supports my thesis that you won't have BTC or any other coin dropping 80% overnight just because some newer one comes along), but aside from that the valuations are all completely reasonable. Ripple is worth 50x more than stellar, the top 10 coins except LTC are all substantially innovative and the lower coins much less so, etc.


And that's perfectly fine. I'm all about "it's the technology that matters, not the currency". The technology is just as useful at 10x less valuation. I don't care about "a cryptocurrency" displacing fiat, I care about the development of cryptoeconomic infrastructure. If there was a zero-counterparty-risk way to simulate dollars, I would say give up bitcoin and use that.


The history there is that Tenebrix was the innovative one with using Scrypt as a mining algorithm (which according to the standards of the day actually counted as a major achievement; this was before every coin was coming out with its own mining algo), but the culture was heavily anti-premine. Tenebrix was premined, Litecoin was not, and so Litecoin won. Today's culture, largely thanks to the efforts of myself, David Johnston and a few others, is much more pro-premine, and so in this world the equivalent of Tenebrix itself is much more likely to succeed.


Was it? I do not recall there ever being a point where Litecoin exceeded 10% of BTC. Ripple is the one that got much closer, actually exceeding bitcoin's market cap at one point (technically, including the latent units, it's at 60% of BTC now).


The problem is not the one-time accrual, it's more of a fragility-theoretic justification. It's that there exists the ability to lay claim to a specific percentage of society's wealth, and that percentage stays fixed, and grows, by default, with no risk. That's not how things should work; the way things should work is that your percentage of wealth should decrease over time unless you actively invest into business projects.


Well, that's only true if we go with the non-fixed-supply model...

Proof of bandwidth, in the sense that I believe most people think about it, is a fundamentally rather unstable idea. It's hard to come up with a system that is _not_ vulnerable to the simple attack of creating 30000 VPSes on a single server, connecting them all to the network, and having them all "send" 1 terabyte of data to each other in a millisecond.
There are some really clever designs, like that from Torcoin, that try to get around this problem by (i) requiring a bond or other proof of economic status to add a server, and (ii) randomly select the servers that nodes must interact with via a hash, preventing a small cluster of nodes from choosing to interact only with itself. However, it's best to try to avoid having this mechanism as a dependency as much as possible unless your project absolutely requires it (and usually it doesn't; bandwidth is a private good, not a public good, and so public-good-funding mechanisms like currency issuance should not be used to subsidize it - it should be A pays B for B's bandwidth to A)

Nope, my government agency wouldn't inspect at all. I would just conduct sting operations, and create an IRS-style reward scheme where you get 30% of the proceeds of any fine if you rat someone out to the government and provide enough evidence.


Doesn't work. The whole point of crime-and-punishment theory is that if you set F * p &gt; r (that's fine * probability of getting caught &gt; revenue), then the expected utility of committing the crime is negative and no amount of insurance can get around that. An efficient insurance market definitely will push the enforcement costs somewhat higher, as you can't rely on risk aversion to make "perceived F" higher than "actual F", but only so much; at some point even without risk aversion it stops being worth it.


True, but I don't think that even the loss of 2x efficiency gains from hyper-efficient uncensored sharing economy platforms is going to do it. I could see it being the tipping point, but only in an already favorable political climate (one where "sclerotic billionaires who are afraid of competition" is a more salient image than "reckless neoliberals tearing down the fabric of society").

One reason why miners might not want to spam their own blocks is because it takes longer for them to propagate (a disincentive that [some people have seriously argued]( is by itself sufficient to regulate block size in the face of no block size limits at all; I do not buy this argument though, as I feel that the resulting equilibrium is far too permissive without high block rewards; a back-of-the-napkin approximation suggests an equilibrium stale rate of ~50%). Another is that the process of filling up a block itself takes computational effort.
I have a mathematical analysis that, if you assume all miners are equally powerful, the latter disincentive itself is actually sufficient to ensure a close-to-optimal block size (one-sentence argument: if there are N miners, then you spend X energy to process one transaction with a 1/N chance of making the block so your private cost per transaction successfully included is X * N, and the social cost is X * N because N miners all spend X resource processing the transaction if it does get in, so private cost and social cost line up); however, since some miners are more powerful than others and there are also other full nodes to worry about, the 1.20x (now 1.50x) limit creates an artificial cap that ensures that those miners that aren't sufficiently affected by those incentives can't break the system.
Also, you are assuming that miners benefit from larger block sizes; it is not at all clear that this is true, in fact I would argue that the optimal block size for miners is much smaller than the socially optimal block size (think of miners in their capacity of voting on the gas limit as shareholders voting on the pricing of a monopolist, then [Econ 102 tells you]( why this is so), so **if miners _are_ spamming in order to manipulate the gas limit up then that implies that the current gas limit is _below_ miners' optimum and so even further below the social optimum, hence miners spamming the gas limit up is actually a good thing.**

I do think that many people overestimate just how censorship-resistant a lot of these services are, particularly once they start expanding beyond crypto-land and touch the real world. If I was a government official and I wanted to crack down on Airbnb and Uber (and their equivalent decentralized competitors), I would just repeatedly do sting operations and raise the fines (up to and including confiscation of the underlying property) until people cooperated. If I wanted to enforce drug laws, I would focus on the postal system, not the financial layer.
For information storage, sure, it's not too hard; I could see copyright becoming completely unenforceable in a decade of two at least for static media like music, books and movies (for software, meanwhile, it'll become superfluous; centralized cloud applications _are_ essentially perfect DRM). But if the plan is to liberate system-D in meatspace, crypto/techno-anarchists would do well to think about those harder problems; I personally would advise them to understand that simple censorship resistance is not going to be good enough and they also need mindshare, and the only way to get that is to build services that don't just push regulators out but actually replace and ideally improve upon their genuinely useful functions. Essentially, think constructively.

But the decentralization adds extra security because you need to try to coordinate a collusion, and an attempt at such coordination would itself make it easy to whistleblow and thereby stop the attack before it happens; additionally, it's more likely that one company will have some weird quirk that drives them to ignore reputational and legal risks than that an entire industry will.

I actually made a mistake in that post; we have only ~530 bitcoin. 
It fluctuates up and down because we get some of our revenues from devcon and donations in bitcoin, and some of our expenses are in bitcoin.
Also, if you check [our address]( we have not sold substantial amounts of ether in ~6 months; most of the increase in our fiat reserve in the last six months have been from selling ~90% of our ETC.

"Signatures not affecting transaction ID" != "Segregated witness". You can remove the sig from the txid before hashing, but that's just a custom hash algorithm, not really "segregating" anything.

This was something that we strongly encouraged exchanges to do FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION; if you didn't, then you would run the risk of losing money in the event of a blockchain fork. Kraken correctly saw that this risk doesn't apply for highly trusted and verified customers, as they can be trusted to re-send deposits in the event of a fork if needed, and allowed such customers to deposit more quickly. I'm surprised that no exchange opened trading before thawing honestly.
For that matter, Ethereum employees were NOT aware that Kraken had this feature, there was no collusion involved and none of us benefited.

Do the simulations show that 20mb blocks will actually be able to propagate through the network in 30s? That implies 5mbps upload bandwidth assuming a single hop, which seems a bit much. What data did you use to come to that conclusion? Does it align with the existing regressions done on block size vs propagation time?
@_date: 2015-08-30 14:44:51


I know that this is true, but it would be really nice to see some numbers. Do you have any info on this? The current stale rates seem indicative of very low propagation times but actual data on inter-miner connectivity would be great to have.

I for one continue to strongly stand by my advice (though I think multisig is even better, and people who aren't comfortable memorizing brainwallets should use more regular solutions in any case), and people who continue to actually advocate trying to memorize randomly generated Electrum passphrases should be whacked over the head with my broken laptop that contains $3k worth of overwritten and unrecoverable storjcoin. The facts are that:
1. These random passphrases are not at all more memorable than random gook, as the study linked in my article above shows.
2. From my personal knowledge and experience, I am convinced that **loss is a much much more frequent problem than theft**.
My own money is stored in brainwallets whose passwords roughly follow the advice above; they're a combination of a username and some formatted words, phrases and song lyrics. Yes, obviously the passwords have suboptimal entropy; but that's why they're much longer than 80 bits! And no, I definitely don't just use a single source of data; using multiple heterogeneous sources is obviously absolutely necessary.
That said, after writing that article I realized that there is another, even more interesting, scheme that allows you to protect against loss even more: combine erasure coding with storing bits on the blockchain. That is, let's say you have a brainwallet containing personally chosen chunks k1, k2, k3, k4, k5 (say, with 27 bits per chunk). Use an erasure code to expand that to k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6, k7, where k6 and k7 will necessarily be pseudorandom. DO NOT MEMORIZE k6 and k7; instead, stick them on the blockchain in a way that you know that you will be able to find them again. Then, if you need to get your brainwallet back, you can combine **any three** of k1, k2, k3, k4, k5 with the k6 and k7 on the blockchain to recover the original seed. You still have 80 bits of security, but it's now stored in a 3-of-5 fashion that's more robust to you losing parts of it.
The reason why you need the blockchain, and can't just erasure code k1, k2, k3 to get k4 and k5 is that if you do that, k4 and k5 will be pseudorandom, which makes them harder to memorize; the whole point of good password schemes is that they have low entropy when stored in your mind, shaped by decades of personal memories and experience that you can use as a compression algorithm, but high entropy from the point of view of everyone else, and random data give you zero such advantage.

If you guys want "Ethereum to become a Bitcoin sidechain" as quickly as possible, here's the recipe:
1. Find 10 semi-trustworthy people, ideally with decent standing in the crypto community.
2. Create a multisig between them.
3. Create a subcurrency inside ethereum, following the [standardized contract API]( for currency contracts.
4. Use [btcrelay]( (basically, a contract that implements a bitcoin light client inside of ethereum) to automatically issue units of that currency to anyone who sends BTC to the multisig address
5. Users can cash out sidecoin by sending it to the btcrelay contract (min cashout amount 100 BTC to avoid wasting the participants' time). The cashout process creates a LOG entry on Ethereum that light clients can easily verify to see who needs to receive a payout. When a payout is sent, you can use btcrelay to confirm to the ethereum contract that it was sent; by doing that you can actually have the contract itself keep track of whether or not the multisig group is processing payouts on time.
And tada, you now have a federated side-coin that has the "network effect" of Bitcoin and Ethereum at the same time _and_ can immediately be used in Augur (or any other currency-agnostic Ethereum contract). I would actually love for someone to do this.
@_date: 2015-08-09 11:15:06
I would be willing to believe that given strong evidence, but I will hold off on my judgement until I see an actual study. But my first instinct is that what you're doing there is creating a human-memorable 1000 bits of entropy that happens to contain 80 bits of the desired data (plus realistically another 500 bits of extra gook), and it would take you less time (and also give adequate security) to memorize 500 bits that you created yourself. In that example, I'm not convinced that I wouldn't accidentally misremember "chicken" or "jenga" as being part of the list...
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:25:21
BTW if people actually want my opinion, I'll provide the courtesy of aggregating it:
  
  
  
From my personal experience with the ethereum testnet, which matches closely with the statistical analyses I've seen on Bitcoin block propagation (I am heavily relying on [Decker and Wattenhofer 2013]( here), bitcoin can definitely survive blocks of up to ~10MB right now, but will start to encounter serious centralization risks (on top of the existing miner centralization issues) going beyond that. If Gavin's IBLT proposal ends up working well, I could see that increasing by another factor of perhaps up to 3-5 but not more; we'll have to rely on Moore's law from there.
In the long run, I am of course a proponent of [random sampling schemes]( which I think can create ultra-scalable blockchains in a far more generalizeable way than other known mechanisms; that said, the design I provided there works with proof of stake much better than proof of work, and I understand that the general opinion here is substantially more pro-PoW than my own, so I would point this group to Dominic Williams's "puzzle towers" work which can essentially simulate the behavior of moderately strong security deposits in a fundamentally PoW-backed system.
@_date: 2015-07-23 20:11:36

@_date: 2015-07-24 08:47:05
That depends; what if creating a highly profitable fee market is necessary for subsidizing long-term network security (which is a public good)? I would argue that if that's the case it would be more optimally paid for by demurrage or inflation as wealth inside the system is a better indicator of ability-to-pay than transaction frequency, but I think the "21 million" figure is quite sacred in this community so that won't fly and so we may have to settle for artificially restricted supply as a "second best".
There are:
1. The fee that it's individually rational for someone to pay
2. The socially optimal fee
3. The fee that miners would choose if they could vote on it (assuming no inter-voter bribery and no Downs/Caplanian rational ignorance/irrationality critiques, this is equivalent to the monopoly price)
4. The fee level that Greg Maxwell, Gavin Andresen et al would implicitly choose if they set the limit as developers with the strongest schelling point.
The real question is whether (1), (3) or (4) is closer to (2); I know that the standard "enlightened libertarian" line is that (1) and (2) may be different but they're closer than the alternatives, but in this case I'm not convinced, especially if lightning network-type tech becomes widely adopted.

There's an individual/collective incentive mismatch here. Even if Greece as a whole doesn't benefit from a store of value, individuals certainly benefit from making themselves invulnerable to politically sourced bail-in risk - assuming bitcoin's other risks don't dominate.
@_date: 2015-07-05 08:24:16
There is always an _issuance rule_ (this is a similar rebuttal to that made against libertarians who argue that the concept of "wealth distribution" is illegitimate because there is no centralized "distributor"; there is always a _distributing process_ which includes the actions of many people and one can very legitimately have normative preferences over it); whether that issuance rule is updated by a central bank or a decentralized algorithm is in itself irrelevant to monetary policy theory, except to the extent that decentralized algorithms provide greater predictability and credible-commitment capabilities under rational expectation models.

Store of value. Sell it two years later when (the theory goes) your euros are down 30% from a haircut or down 40% from force-conversion into drachmas and your politically invulnerable cryptotokens are scot-free.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:43:37


Two reasons:
1. You can only fix prices in BTC-denominated terms from within the protocol, and BTC is volatile, so you'll have a harder time targeting the fee to something close to the optimum.
2. If the purpose of price interventions is to ensure enough revenue for miners to pay for network security, then the revenue for mandatory fees must go to miners (as opposed to being burned). But then, miners may start evading the minimum, essentially saying "I'll pay you 0.0099 btc to give me a tx with a 0.01 btc fee", and if that tactic gets widespread the minimum becomes pointless. To avoid that you want to have an actual restriction on block size.
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:36:20

This is a good counterpoint; capital controls evasion with cryptocurrencies only really works well when you can do _some_ things with your money but not all things, eg. transfer it internally only, but in this case everyone's euros were outright frozen almost entirely, so you couldn't buy bitcoin with them. That said, there are two caveats:
1. Starting up a foreign bank account requires more work than a cryptocurrency account.
2. If you're the sort of person who fears a crisis in the US, the US has close to global reach so actually being _out of the banking system_ is what you need.

1. "Ethereum" is not some kind of super-coordinated cabal. Even if you believe that (i) the Ethereum Foundation is a super-coordinated cabal, and (ii) the Ethereum Foundation monopolizes Ethereum protocol R&amp;D, it's hard to deny that Parity is a totally independent team.
2. Given that Ethereum follows an explicit strategy of encouraging decentralized development through implementation diversity, we clearly believe that implementation diversity is a good thing for blockchains. If our purpose was to "steal" market cap from Bitcoin, we would not be helping Bitcoin by increasing its implementation diversity.

5000 blocks * 5.27 ether per block (including uncle rewards) ~= 9.7m ETH mined per year


Yes, a pre-determined fixed issuance rate is **totally** like the Federal Reserve being able to inflate the monetary base on a whim and having an explicit stated policy targeting ~2% depreciation of the token per year (that said, if you like a fed model better, as it does have its genuine advantages regarding price stability, you can implement a decentralized version of it on top of ethereum as a DAO).

I am happy that there is such a large group of institutions that is willing to put so much effort into researching blockchain technology.

(And yes, I realize that R3 will be using private chains and not public; private chain uses of ethereum still support the ethereum developer community and are imo fully compatible with an interoperable multi-chain vision)
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:39:22
Ok, let me spell out the argument again.
1. Ethereum is not a super-coordinated cabal. "Parity != Ethereum foundation" follows from this.
2. If we **were** a super-coordinated cabal, and had the intention to "steal market cap from Bitcoin", helping Bitcoin with implementation diversity is not the sort of thing that we would do, because our goal would be to steal from Bitcoin, not help it. Therefore, the fact that Parity **did** release this client means that either (i) Ethereum is not a super-coordinated cabal, or (ii) Ethereum's goal is not to "steal market cap from Bitcoin" (my personal view is that both are not the case).
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:40:45
Parity != ethereum. I personally knew nothing about this until today.
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:56:39
Sure, I'm using David Friedman's broader interpretation of the concept where he extends it to, for example, develop an explanation for the concept of property rights; I'll admit that. Feel free to replace "cannot communicate" with "hard to negotiate"; regarding payoffs, I don't think it matters that much whether or not payoffs are equal, particularly note that the archetypal "Grand Central Station" example is decidedly not of that category as each individual's highest payoff would be for the meeting to take place at their house. I agree that schelling point concerns are more a nice-to-have and should not override technical readiness; so if there is a moderately good reason to have a fork substantially earlier or later than 420k then that should obviously be done.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:40:45
No. Ethereum continues to be a much more powerful and expressive platform and there are very many things that can be done with ethereum that simply cannot be done with bitcoin. Turing-complete was the wrong thing to emphasize when describing it, but the fact that ethereum remains fundamentally capable of doing much more still remains.

Well how many of the 30 usages [of the term here]( have strictly **no** communication? Same with [this lesswrong article]( I'm a linguistic descriptivist, so pointing me to 1000 "official definitions" will not sway me, I'm more concerned with using words that people will understand because they fall roughly in line with general usage.


Ok, this sounds like the sort of fallacy that gets rebutted the first day of econ 101. Transportation costs are real, and time and effort is a cost just as real as dollars. It's easier to meet people at GCT than it is to meet people on the top floor of the Empire State Building, or the southernmost tip of Battery Park. So Wikipedia's "definitional evidence" is wrong. Now of course, schelling point concerns are a major argument privileging GCT on top of ease of transportation, but the point is that even that game is not "pure" in that payoffs are otherwise equal.


If the post you were replying to said something like "well, normal projects launch within 3 months of being announced and the standard deviation is 1 month so I think we should launch now otherwise at &gt;3std above mean our project will be very abnormally slow", then your sentence would be completely acceptable.

One simple practical issue is that the bitcoin blockchain _currently_ doesn't keep track of stales, though that should not be too hard to add in via a softfork that forces them into the coinbase in some way. Another disadvantage is that it does not take a stance on the decentralization vs tx load issue, and basically allows any equilibrium on that particular tradeoff frontier to form, including a "centralization black hole" of one miner. But then, every other scheme that doesn't try to fix prices via either voting or developer choice has that flaw as well (and often much worse) and so far I haven't come up with any other mechanism that isn't likely to absurdly under or over-target unless we hit the razor-thin edge of a correct compromise.

The reason why I said "Turing completeness is a red herring" is that Turing incompleteness is actually not that big a limitation on expressiveness. Specifically, there exists a class of languages called "decidable languages" that are almost as powerful as Turing-complete languages with the only exception being that they cannot support variable-length loops - that is, the length of every loop has to be known ahead of time.
Because there are genuine security benefits to programming in a decidable language in many cases, one of my side projects is a high-level language called [Viper]( which is a decidable language that compiles down to ethereum EVM code; the result is that for any contract written in Viper you can compute a precise upper bound on the amount of gas that any given function of that contract will consume. However, you can still use Viper to implement very complex things; for example, our current implementation of the planned validator management and incentivization logic for our proof-of-stake Casper algorithm is [written in Viper](
The reason why we did not make the entire EVM decidable is simply the fact that, for various reasons, making it decidable is harder than _not_ making it decidable and would have made the protocol _more_ complex; see details [in the white paper]( A Turing-complete language is base layer: you can build any paradigm you want on top.

This thread gives me an idea - what if companies like dailybitcoins.com use Google or Reddit or Bitcointalk accounts for their free bitcoin giveaways rather than just IP addresses and captchas? It would greatly reduce fraud, potentially allowing the sites to give out much more. And one could even create such a site to serve a dual purpose. Imagine if I wanted to help the [subreddit on Mesoamerica]( get more attention. Then I could create a faucet that gives a differential amount based on the number of upvotes you get inside of that subreddit, encouraging people to post good comments there.
Then again, it could also itself be pretty susceptible to fraud; I guess someone would have to try to see how well it can turn out.

Force is not a precondition for a tragedy of the commons. The commons here is the ability to make money by mining on the Bitcoin network. Every transaction added to the blockchain adds a storage cost to the mining process, thus polluting the commons. The more polluted the commons is, the less profitable it is to mine for all. Of course miners have the choice of stopping mining entirely, but that's like saying that the tragedy of the commons with regards to environmental issues doesn't exist because you can just move to the Sahara desert. 
And, by the way, the block size limit is not some kind of violently imposed central bank mandate. Miners are free to ignore it as they wish already. It turns out that it's a convenient mutually beneficial Nash equilibrium for all miners to support it now that it exists, and so they do.

Well, Silk Road has a central escrow service already, so within that particular context that point is moot.
As for the Bitcoin world in general, I disagree. As long as the escrow's stake in the reputation is greater than the value of what you're selling, you would go for the service with lower fees and better service, not the larger one. So the market could easily stabilize into a few dozen or hundred medium-sized providers. Secondly, there are various multisignature transaction based options that will be able to remove the trust in the escrow or even allow third-party-free escrow entirely (basically, if there's no mutual agreement the bitcoins are lost forever) in the future.

I disagree. The only reason it went so high in July 2011 was because of a sudden spike in media attention that didn't last. If you look at the [Google Trends volume]( you'll find that it has been moving up and down closely with the Bitcoin price, even rising by pretty much the same proportion from March to June as the price and falling the same until November. And in this new rally the trends volume is not rising with the price. To me, that's a reason to be very cautious.

Game-theoretically, it would make perfect sense for miners to play along with such a strategy. However, is that the way Bitcoin miners actually work now? Does a fee made by a transaction with an unconfirmed parent incentivize miners to include the transaction along with its (possibly feeless and even non-standard/bloated) parent?

Actually, blockchain.info doesn't hold onto your bitcoins. Creating, encrypting and decrypting your wallet is done client-side, so they never see your password or your private keys. It's essentially equivalent to a client-side application with a built-in secure backup feature, except the application runs in your browser.
Also, as a desktop client I recommend Electrum. It doesn't bother with a blockchain at all; instead, it stores all your private data locally, but hooks up to a server to get transactions. The server, like the client, is open source and there are at least a dozen to choose from, so the concept is still reasonably decentralized. I agree that pushing Bitcoin-Qt as the default solution is a bad idea at this point.

There were no "suspicious" motives involved here. I would have gladly thrown in MPEX had I remembered that it has BTC options available. That's it. I just overlooked you. I'm sorry. (And by the way it's fixed now)
And personally, I would like to add a little constructive criticism. Even though MPEX itself may not be minor, its BTC option arm certainly is. Just look at yourselves. You have a number of cryptic, disparate options with names like "O.BTCUSD.C070T" (What exactly is the leverage on that thing? Is it even a call or a put?), two to five trades _per month_ and spreads in the 30% range. And for the 99% of the population that is not willing to cough up the 30 BTC registration fee and have to deal with GPG and run python scripts every time they want to make a trade, you might as well not exist at all. What you have is not what most people want. What most people want is a convenient, Bitcoinica-style interface where they can deposit their money, log in, and see convenient little buttons clearly labelled "Buy" and "Sell" so that they know exactly what they need to do if they want to modify their exposure in a given direction. If you do not do that, you'll be forever delegated to the wealthy fringe. That's a fringe that lets you claim record volumes, true, but it is not a fringe that makes you notable to the average person - and that's a fact that you've just seen experimentally proven with myself.

As my BM article [here]( points out, the largest of their three machines will have more hash power than all but three pools, and roughly matches the weakest of those (Slush). That's right - a single computer will be as powerful as Slush. And given that even with 21000 GH/s network hash power the SC Single can pay for itself in two weeks, I don't think we'll see the influx of these machines reach any kind of equilibrium until we're approaching a third of a petahash.

This is a really bad argument even if it's supporting something close to the right cause.
Imagine a parallel universe where the distribution of gold in the earth (and therefore the resultant supply curve) was such that a 1% rise in gold prices increased the gold supply by only a third as high a percentage as it does in our universe (ie. the supply curve is much closer to Bitcoin's vertical ideal). Everything else is the same. In such a universe, this same argument, if it were true, would apply and the supply of gold mined would be just as optimal. Therefore, we're left with a situation where in the two parallel universes the supposedly "optimal" supply of gold is different, even though all the social and economic factors that actually determine how good a given supply of gold is remain exactly the same.

Also some more practical alternatives: 
* send 0.01xxxxxx where each xx = the alphabet index of the letter you're trying to send, 00 being space. So hello would be 0.01080512 0.01121200. Advantage: much more compact, but nerds can still probably figure it out if they don't know what protocol you're using beforehand. Disadvantage: limited to letters and space.
* send 0.01xxxxxx where each xx = the ascii code of the letter mod 100. So hello would be 0.01040108 0.01081132. Advantage: even more compact, as it can support all 96 ASCII characters that people care about (ie. not line feeds et al). Disadvantage: protocol not self-evident.
* Send 0.0tt0xxxx, where xxxx = one of the above two, and tt = the index of the message being sent. So hello would be, using the first protocol, 0.00100805 0.00201212 0.00301500. Advantage: transactions can be sent all at once. Disadvantage: less efficient.

And you quoted my main reason why. The entire Bitcoin economy is still a startup, and startups can and do frequently grow at even over 1000% per year. Many people have said that the Bitcoin economy measures time in months where the real world uses years, and it's true. Things do move fast here. BitPay only had a trading volume of $10,000 a month eight months ago. But the flip side is, things break often, and the entire Bitcoin economy could still potentially collapse before the investment even doubles.

The unit we should be looking at is watt consumption per dollar - is the number of watts that each dollar of hardware is consuming going up or down? The amount you pay for electricity is proportional to how much you consume, so it's a good proxy for the cost ratios.
Now, look [here]( You can see the electricity consumption of FPGAs and GPUs. The FPGAs are just about all in the 5-50 watt range, and cost is around $400-$600. The GPUs, however, are all between 50-200 watts. Their prices seem to all be less than $200. And I only see ASIC continuing this trend.
The fact that the cost structure will shift more and more to capital over time is basically derived from the concept of specialization itself - the word pretty much means making an initial expenditure for the sake of greater efficiency at a particular task.

If his economic activities stay largely within the Bitcoin economy then on average most of the long-term rise and fall of the Bitcoin price will affect the real value of his portfolio as well. So the long-term change in the Bitcoin price itself does not hamper or increase his chances of earning his BTC rewards that much.
I don't think you quite understand my argument about risk. The risk that drives interest rates isn't from the point of view of the borrower, it's from the point of view of the lender. For example, US government debt yields are low because the investors, rightly or wrongly, believe that there is a very low chance that the government will default. On the other hand, credit card interest rates are very high because lots of people do, whether explicitly or implicitly by trying to sit it out, default on their credit card debt.
Now, consider how things look from the point of view of a lender in the Bitcoin economy.
1. Keeping your bitcoins to yourself is almost perfectly safe if you don't make stupid mistakes. Traditional fiat money does not have this attribute; if people tried to hide $100,000 under their mattresses we would hear lots of stories about houses getting burned down or robbers sneaking in and people losing their entire life savings. This increases the relative risk of investing one's BTC compared to investing fiat.
2. Counterparty risk in the Bitcoin economy is very high. There have been lots of thefts and scams in the Bitcoin economy in the past year, you're often dealing with pseudonymous people, the only institutional check against fraud is a difficult-to-use web of trust, and if your money is stolen you often have no way of getting it back. This also increases the relative risk of investing one's BTC compared to investing fiat.
3. Currency risk is very high. Regardless of what happens to the investment itself, the shifts in the value of the underlying currency are massive by fiat currency standards, and can easily overwhelm the effect of a given investment.
This explains the demand side of the equation, or why people are not willing to invest at lower rates (there are exceptions like SatoshiDice, of course, but only very well-trusted entrepreneurs are able to get them).
To explain the supply side of the equation, it suffices to repeat the argument that I made above: Bitcoin is a bunch of startups, and startups grow by factors of much more than 2.8 per year all the time.

Can they? Sure, they can do what they want in the short term, but if any of them actually tried to take your money and keep it with no intention of ever giving it back, I'm pretty sure government involvement will be on your side if you choose to seek it just like everywhere else.
@_date: 2012-12-04 00:59:28
Because wallets are actually an active area of Bitcoin development, and innovative things are still being done with them. For example, the kind of wallet that Electrum uses is called a deterministic wallet - all private keys (and therefore by extension all public keys and addresses) are generated from a single seed, and so if you write the seed down, if you ever lose your wallet you can immediately recover it simply by entering the seed into Electrum's wallet recovery mode. Thanks to the finer properties of elliptic curve mathematics, this format also allows for you to create something called a watching-only wallet, from which the program of the addresses that the original wallet can create, but none of the private keys. Bitcoin-Qt's wallets, on the other hand, are just collections of randomly generated privkey/address pairs. Once we see multisignature wallets coming into play we might need to redesign wallets yet again.
Having the various Bitcoin clients standardize on a single wallet data format is kind of like having browsers standardize on a single cache directory format - embarking on such a project would probably slow things down more than anything else.

To be fair, BitInstant, Coinabul, various exchanges and even Bitcoin Magazine ourselves self-advertise on here at times. I think in some cases it is warranted - if you're advertising products that are truly interesting and that lots of people want, then people would be really interested in hearing about them, and so spreading the word on a Bitcoin enthusiast forum is a win-win. For example, if you want to "dip your feet into owning some" bitcoins, then BitInstant posting an ad for a service that lets you do so more easily would be very appropriate for you. On the other hand, if you do it excessively and/or frivolously then I agree, it's stupid.

Per character, there are either two or four possible representations - two if it's not a letter (eg. 3 and %33) and four if it is (eg. e, E, %65, %45). The use of percent escapes is legal in every character in " but not in " But in " we can still use uppercase and lowercase at will. Thus, we have:

Blockchain's mixer is already quite good, and the fact that so many people use it itself makes it better because that increases the anonymity set. You'd be hard pressed to make something better.
However, there is one way a new entrant can beat out Blockchain: greater privacy. Right now, although Blockchain's mixer protects your privacy from the outside world, Blockchain itself knows which address sent how much to what, so with Blockchain's help (or if Blockchain gets hacked) someone trying to follow your trail can easily break your anonymity.
The way to fix this is to use a protocol called [blind signatures]( to create a sort of centralized Bitcoin-backed cryptocurrency, which has the property that no one, not even the issuer, can trace transactions. If you want to find out more about the math that allows this, the Wikipedia article shows the basic steps (shameless plug: my article in issue 4 of Bitcoin Magazine explains this stuff too). Someone wanting to mix coins would use them buy your Bitcoin deposit tokens in a "blinded" way and then sell those tokens back in exchange for bitcoins sent to a different address a few hours later, and no one will be able to link the two transactions together. If you don't want people trusting you and your "cryptocurrency" as a bank, I would recommend setting the service up so that you issue a new currency every day, such that every currency expires and becomes worthless after a week if not redeemed before then.

In order for that to work, you would have to somehow get 95%+ of the population to suddenly agree on a single database of stolen coins - if you don't, everyone who signs up for your system will simply be inconveniencing themselves as those who hold stolen coins can keep trying to use them until someone accepts. And if you do succeed, you've basically created a centralized authority over Bitcoin, and we're almost right back where we were with the banking system and Paypal.

If sellers (perhaps funded by Silk Road itself) start operating a program by which they seek out the addresses of Bitcoin community members and randomly ship off 10% of their wares to them, that might actually work - many Bitcoiners have heard of Silk Road, so even if police investigate a drug recipient and find that they had researched/logged on to Silk Road before deniability would still exist. The problem is, of course, that quite a few actually innocent people would get burned before law enforcement realizes what is going on.

Are "actual currencies" able to ever be converted to anything? Not since we went off the gold standard in 1971. And even then gold's use as a currency pushed its value many times above anything that could be justified by any ultimate uses. 


Your question is actually a much more important one than you think - a significant number of Bitcoin-based stock markets, gambling sites and the like are based on the legal theory that bitcoins are not real money. Currently, most definitions of money refer to some kind of convertibility to government-recognized currency, so Bitcoin may be in the clear, but it's a grey area and it can change at any moment.

Let's say there are two people in separate solitary confinement, and the prison guards get disgruntled because they think they're not being paid enough and so they decide to play a game. They give both people the same list of eight numbers, and tell them that if they pick the same number the guards will release them both that very night. The eight numbers are:
23 45 81 100 117 122 145 154
Which number would the prisoners pick?
The chance that the prisoners will be able to escape is actually a lot higher than 12.5%, and the reason is that they are much more likely to pick a specific one of those numbers than any of the others: 100. This is because 100 is a round number and there's an established social convention that round numbers are somehow more "important" than non-round numbers, and each prisoner knows that the other is likely thinking the same thing that they are.
The same logic that these prisoners use can be applied to people in a market trying to figure out which currency is valuable. Our society has an established convention that being "the first" is important - look at how much attention we pay to the gold medallist in an Olympic game, the first man to climb a given mountain or get into space, or the world's tallest tower, compared to how much attention we give to their counterparts who come in fourth or twelfth. Everyone knows that this convention exists, and everyone knows that everyone else is aware of it, and so we all settle down on Bitcoin being the most valuable because it, and only it, is the first cryptocurrency ever to be created.

Fast syncing doesn't really care about the gas limit; it just header-syncs to a recent block and downloads the state from there. So it should work fairly equally quickly regardless of how inefficient block processing is, as long as block processing is possible at all.

Actually, I think you have things exactly backwards. In reality (this is discussed in detail in David Graeber's Debt: The First 5000 Years), barter was actually historically quite rare, and when money arose it was usually because it was imposed by kings as a form of taxation.
Praxeologically, however, he was exactly correct. However, the problem with praxeology is that although the theorems it produces are mathematically sound you really have to be careful when you're translating abstract praxeological concepts to their equivalents in reality. The statement "money naturally arises out of an easily transportable/divisible/etc good with a pre-existing value" is of course true, but it says nothing about what that pre-existing value is. It's just sort of assumed that it's some agricultural or industrial function. However, that pre-existing value can be anything. In the case of monetary systems imposed by kings, the value of gold becomes its ability to appease the coercive demands of a tyrant. In the case of Bitcoin, its original value is, ironically enough, a pyramid scheme - the earliest users all bought in because they expected it to grow much bigger later on. Unlike other pyramid schemes, however, Bitcoin's value is, if the project succeeds, will stabilize once it gets to the top. The pyramid scheme function falls away, but the currency function stays. That's why Bitcoin satisfies the regression theorem just fine despite having no agricultural or industrial value behind it all.

Satoshi disabling nearly all opcodes and then enabling them one by one is not micromanaging? IMO it is, and it's a rather good kind of micromanaging too. Also, add to that the ongoing micromanagement around new opcodes (CLTV, etc).


It can but not well. In the long term the opcode economics need to be changed because (i) eventually the state will get too big to entirely cache into RAM, (ii) we want to have multiple layers of defense so that even poorly written clients can keep up with the blockchain fine, (iii) we eventually want to raise the gas limit further, and to do so we need assurance that there aren't any opcodes that take much longer than others.

Arbitrage _is the way_ markets become perfect.

No one has the right to claim or deny what "the" purpose of Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is a versatile technology, with a variety of different features that lend themselves well to a number of different use cases. Some use it to be anonymous, others use it to avoid fees or because it's more convenient, still others use it as an ideological act of economic separatism. All of these things are purposes to which Bitcoin has been put to use, and none are any more "correct" than the other.

Actually, it was not at all about Bitcoin maximalism. It's more about this weird ideology that I can't fully comprehend that sees "complete trustlessness" as this kind of ideal Platonic form that must be maintained at all costs, and that some people think Bitcoin actually has attained (hint: it has not, and neither have Ethereum, Ripple or Stellar).
For me, I have the strong moral intuition that proof of work wasting $300 million per year is utterly tragic, and so yes I am willing to undertake horrible mental gymnastics in order to create a protocol that works and provides near-equivalent security at much lower cost. I am honestly struggling to understand why so few others here find this important. Then, when I come up with a scheme (or rather, come up with a formalism that includes my scheme and a few other people's schemes) that does provide cryptoeconomic security guarantees at perhaps 50x lower cost, people jump out at weak subjectivity and make the argument that society somehow cannot gather enough social consensus outside the system in order to agree on the value of a block hash from 12 months ago.
There are a few other things, like Chicago vs Austrian economics (you might notice I did not put a supply hard cap on ether, and have been pushing stablecoins for months now), but my far-mode sociological analysis suggests that all of these issues seem to cut to some kind of deep divide between personal worldviews.

The core parts of the government that I mentioned (constitution, bicameral system, etc) are in practice quite static and not adapted all that often; that's specifically why I brought them up. In the US they've stayed the same for over 200 years. **Culture** is dynamic; institutions are not. Now, if you can create an institution around which you can grow a dynamic culture, then that may well be the best solution - and that actually is the way that I am trying to solve the data availability problem: create maximally simple institutions that create incentives for a culture to exist that adapts to make sure the issue continues to not be a problem.
There are plenty of other examples I could go into in software and cryptography. Particularly:
* Hash algorithms - things like SHA256, SHA3, etc, don't have anything close to a clean-and-simple underlying model. They're all about "here's a list of known problems, like exploiting linearity, let's come up with a scheme that does not look like it will run into them, and stack it on top of itself 80 times just to be sure".
* Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus algorithms (as in, Byzantine-paxos-like stuff)
* Symmetric and asymmetric encryption protocols; eg. [this thing](
* Zero knowledge proofs
All of these end up being moderately complex precisely because the basic design almost works but has some flaws A, B and C, you can come up with clever patches to fix A, B and C, and then you're done. True, sometimes your patches themselves have problems D, E, F and G, and so on, but sometimes _the buck actually stops_.

The problem is that the process of validating a transaction and making sure that it has not yet been spent would then require a challenge-response protocol ("can anyone show me a transaction that has spent this output? No? Going once, going twice, okay I accept"), and that leads to certain kinds of nasty scenarios (see "Example 7.0.8 (Double-spending gotcha attack)" in the scalability paper). I'm not convinced that "push responsibility out to the edges" is an acceptable solution essentially for the kinds of reasons that I describe in the "data availability" chapter; game-theoretically forcing public revelation and storing everything in a DHT seems like the most sensible approach.

If you were talking about mining as it was in 2010, I would quite agree with you; indeed, back then I was one of those disliking PoS because it felt oligarchic. With mining in 2015, on the other hand, I am not convinced that the devil we know is much less than a devil; with PoS, if you're 10x richer you get 10x more revenue, but with PoW if you're 10x richer you may get 15-20x more revenue due to economies of scale. Back in May 2014 I walked through a factory in Shenzhen that was producing 25% of all new bitcoin ASICs at the time on the third floor - and on the first floor it was producing 25% of all new litecoin ASICs.

Umm, I've heard many arguments in favor of UTXOs over balances, some moderately legitimate (eg. privacy is probably the most compelling), but I have not been able to formulate an argument for why it's less scalable. Ripple uses the system, and its state is as I recall still only a few gigabytes even as its (discardable) history has climbed to roughly 1T, precisely because it only needs to store one state object per user instead of one state object per UTXO; it's actually several times _more_ scalable.

It's _succinct ZK proofs_ that are the real magic; they have the ability to make a proof of a statement that takes a very long time to compute by yourself but where the proof can be evaluated very quickly. It's not sufficient to solve blockchain scalability by itself, because of the data availability problems that I spend 10 pages talking about in the scalability paper, but it is a very powerful ingredient.

I kinda disagree. If you look at the real world, the systems that need stability the most (the best example is political systems) often end up using complicated multi-heuristic schemes to try to guard against various failure modes ad-hoc, including democracy, constitutions, multicameral legislatures, courts, etc. Airplanes and space equipment ends up being complex to some extent precisely because each individual added bell and whistle adds an extra dimension of safety. So the fact that my designs end up with one sub-mechanism being designed to handle each problem and do it well is actually rather encouraging at least to me.


Sure, but "blockchain" is at this point such a wide concept that I don't think there's a single one design. I am trying to maximally approach the ideal of "magic decentralized computer that you can throw anything on" purely because it's an abstraction that makes life very easy for developers, and developer ease of use is IMO extremely important. Pretty much all progress in computer science is about creating more and more powerful abstractions.
As for the other issues, I've become convinced that most of the debates are really disguised questions of political values (eg. I'll predict that "PoW is better than PoS" is strongly correllated with "gold is a a good store of value because it has objective value and is not purely an illusion of social consensus"), and the others are a matter of how much you value different kinds of decentralization (eg. I do truly think that the ASIC revolution has, as [Tim Swanson put it]( made Bitcoin qualitatively less secure than it was two years ago).

I have been talking to some of the companies that are involved in the "make a centralized fork of Ethereum" business. The general responses are:
1. The company making the software will not be running any of the nodes. Their clients will.
2. In some cases, the blockchain is still decentralized, but between a collection of, say, 15 companies, so it has no political-single-point-of-failure but is also not open-access.
3. The consensus nodes of these blockchains will in many cases not allow arbitrary actors onboard, mitigating the risk of funding anyone on a blacklist. 
4. Many of these blockchains won't even be doing anything with money.

1. Bitcoin is NOT "trustless". Aside from living a life of pure autarky on an island, nothing is. It's trusting a small group of people of unknown size who happen to be currently anonymous. It's also trusting the Chinese government not to send a warrant to every mine in their country and force them to mount a 51% attack.
2. Bitcoin mines are also run to a large extent by "douche-canoes whose only motivation is wealth". And if they're not douche-canoes now, by the time the industry fully professionalizes...
I think people here should think of decentralization and trust as much more of a scalar than a boolean, and also realize that non-explicit centralization is not necessarily better than explicit centralization.
As for privacy, it is a very nice-to-have, but some people need it much much more than others; I don't particularly need it and the Ethereum foundation doesn't particularly need it, so reusing addresses is fine. For those who do need it, Bitcoin privacy is not enough - see how the recent DEA agents got caught. You need zerocash.
I'm also not convinced that Bitcoin is actually all that much of an improvement over balance-based systems even with no address reuse; by computing closures you can often figure out a person's "account" anyway, and Mike Hearn's [merge avoidance]( basically amounts to "have your software pretend that you have multiple accounts", which balance-based systems can do too.

See page 2:


node can challenge invalid blocks, reverting the harmful transactions and transferring the malfeasant validators’ security deposit to the challengers as a reward unless the challenge is answered by a confirmation of validity from a much greater number of validators.
That's basically the entire core of it. But I suppose I should make it more prominent...
@_date: 2015-04-24 08:48:32
1. I'm not concerned about RAFT. The concerns in cryptocurrency consensus generally map fairly poorly to traditional BFT research; most of the problems are inherently economic in nature, not compsci-theoretic. I specifically have concerns about the economic aspect (namely, DPOS). It may well work just fine, but it's much more economically untested and has significant concerns (eg. I recall an informal study showed that you only need ~8% of the BTS stake to 51% attack it since so few people vote).
2. It being hashed into the bitcoin blockchain doesn't really do much; see page 2 of [my scalability paper]( for details.
3. Your consensus algo is not all that complex; you're fine there.

New coins come in two forms:
* The genesis state already contains the coins of everyone who bought during the presale
* There is a protocol rule that the miner of a block gets 5.9 ETH for free after executing all transactions.


Yeah, that's not true. The parent was referring to replay attacks: suppose I have balance 100 and send you 10. Then, you take that transaction and republish it to the blockchain 10 times to get all my money. This is solved by having every account store a "nonce", which increments every time a transaction is made. For a transaction to be valid, its nonce must equal the account nonce.
If you want to make this work and still have accounts get deleted if they are no longer used, then the solution is to have accounts that have a zero balance get deleted after some period of time, and have transactions have a time limit in order to prevent the problem where if an account is deleted then reused again then the nonce resets to zero so old transactions are valid again.

@_date: 2015-04-12 17:39:45


Hence why a transaction's validity window must be smaller than the account deletion time (eg. transactions would be valid at most 1 day after they are created, zero-value accounts can be deleted after a day).
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:16:07
I actually deliberately designed this particular algorithm to be PoW-friendly, even though as you know I strongly prefer tendermint-style PoS (I'm assuming by "fails to understand distributed consensus" you are referring to that particular disagreement, since that's been my experience so far...). I should probably do a better job clarifying that the intent is to make an addon that can be applied to almost any consensus algorithm (eg. replace "90 of 135 validators" with "90 of the last 135 miners") to "turn it into" a scalable one.
@_date: 2015-04-12 15:35:56


So that doesn't really solve scalability since there would still need to exist some nodes that store the entire history of the last N years, and at that point those nodes don't really need the merkle proof to do validation; you could just send them the transaction and _they_ would be capable of computing the proof.
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:24:18
It's more complex, but the benefit is potential quite significant savings in storage space, maybe 3-10x.
Actually what led me to start really hating UTXOs is managing the wallet for the Ethereum crowdsale: we got over 9000 UTXOs, and so we could not spend them without manually writing a script to spend ~15 at a time because you need to reference each UTXO and provide a signature, and 15 gets you almost to the 10k limit. And then we had to repeat that collation step multiple times... All of those annoyances go away in an account system.
@_date: 2015-04-15 05:53:06










I don't think you're quite up to date on how modern PoS schemes work. Generally, coins that participate in the staking process need to be locked into a long-term security deposit, allowing those coins to be destroyed in the event of malfeasance. So if the government agency accumulates 500k coins and does an attack (which will fail; I would estimate that if bitcoin goes PoS at least 2-4m coins will participate - I would actually advocate using PID controllers or some other such mechanism to deliberately target 25% participation), then those 500k coins will automatically be destroyed by the protocol. Unlike ASICs, which are anonymous and where you can get around any kind of network/IP blocks by just moving to a different ISP, coins in stake are locked away for a long long time (think 3-12 months).
@_date: 2015-04-13 17:16:42
There's a difference between _transactions_ and _messages_ in ethereum. Transactions always come from the outside, messages are generated by contracts. There is no ability to generate a long-term transaction; a contract can only generate a long-term message. But the effect of the two is the same. Messages are generated inside the system so there is no need to bother with nonces or cryptography for them.
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:47:57


That problem exists just as easily in a non-scalable system; see the whole mining pool centralization hubbub. But generally, if you wait until you see 2/3 confirmations before validating yourself, then you will end up validating later and thus run the risk of not getting your signature included in time. Pooling behavior is a bit more of an issue, but still manageable; I think the only way to prevent pooling behavior is to (1) make the validation effort cheap enough, which scalability helps with, and (2) have severe punishments for validating something incorrect (in my models, the security deposit that would be lost is perhaps 10000x the reward so that condition is met). The fact that punishment for malfeasance is very high actually makes collusion substantially harder.

How does anti-replay protection not scale? It's a single object in each account. If you're concerned about dead accounts with nonces floating around, then you can solve that by giving transactions timeouts and flushing accounts periodically.

The only risk is that an older transaction with nonce 0 can be replayed once the account receives the funds. That is why the scheme needs to be coupled with a transaction timestamp, so the older transaction would be invalid dud to time expiry.

The idea that computers can include built-in proof of work modules in order to interact with network protocols that require PoW for anti-DDoS purposes is theoretically sound. But, (i) that's a far cry from a "unique device ID", and (ii) in order for that to work well you precisely _don't_ want to combine that PoW with bitcoin mining; otherwise more efficient asic farms will be able to produce many of these PoWs at zero marginal cost because they're simultaneously getting even more bitcoin revenue out of them whereas your smaller and less efficient ASIC will have higher marginal cost.
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:33:36


So that's the fundamental difference. My model doesn't require cross-substate movements to be registered in the main chain to any greater extent than intra-substate movements.
@_date: 2015-04-13 04:53:48
"Need" and "desire" are not fundamentally different; they are just different points on a diminishing marginal returns curve. So I don't think we disagree much on that issue. You want privacy, you maintain 5 accounts or 5 UTXO sets, and use zerocash to jump between them.
@_date: 2015-04-12 09:33:58
Checkpointing doesn't actually provide security; this is a common misconception. A 51% attacker on the sub-chain can just start maintaining a secret fork and checkpoint the hashes of the secret fork and the main chain, and only later reveal the secret fork. Doing so does provide early warning of a double spend, but it still does nothing to solve consensus loss.
The one-sentence core of the idea described in the paper is to choose a _random sample_ of 135 nodes (weighted by whatever you want; I like PoS) and require them to validate every block.
@_date: 2015-04-12 09:14:17
I provided some comments deep in the paper. My current view is that it is something that could be turned into something good, but the thinking on data availability seems a bit incomplete. Data availability is basically the primary reason why scalability is hard, and more thinking and formalization is required to determine how to either make sure that data is available or have the system survive despite unavailability (tree chains, being a boring old currency and not a Turing-complete arbitrary-state machine with no restrictions on what the state could represent, has the advantage that you can actually set the system up to have mathematical bounds on the damage that could be caused by some particular piece of data disappearing). My chapter on data availability discusses a lot of the potential pitfalls that tree chains will need to deal with (search "sudden millionaire attack" and "crying wolf attack").
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:54:10
Ah, I had meant the comment to just be there for internal help, not as any kind of public statement; sorry about that. The complexity even referred to the description more so than the actual algo; it might be good to add to the protocol spec something like "you could use any traditional BFT algo here, but we'll use RAFT because we like its properties X, Y, Z"
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:44:21


If the relayed nodes are non-lazy, then everything is fine. The bottom level is not a consensus, it's validity checking which is ultimately enforced by a distinct mechanism; it doesn't matter too much even if everyone points at the same source, since as soon as the source lies everyone who signed off on the block will get caught and their deposits will be destroyed.
And, as before, I'll point out that this failure mode is not unique to scalable systems; even plain old bitcoin has led to heavy mining pool centralization.

@_date: 2015-04-12 16:49:04


Possibly. And if that happens then fine. Once invalid blocks start appearing that make it through the probabilistic validation because validators are lazy, then it becomes profitable to challenge them, and then the validators that aren't careful start seriously losing money. I get the law-and-economics point that the equilibrium level of "crime" is nonzero regardless of how high punishment goes even if it ends up being very small, but I think that a very small number of altruistic challengers should be sufficient to bridge the gap between 0.01% and zero.
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:12:24
Right, so the other key property of my design is that _there is no single node in the network that needs to process all transactions or even store the entire state_. Individual collation objects containing transactions are only allowed to operate over a few substates, and Merkle proofs are used to ensure that they get validated. The top-level consensus only deals with the headers of collation objects, not with transactions; hence O(N^2) scalability (every node needs to process O(N) collation objects on the header chain and O(N) transactions in each substate that it cares about). Potentially thousands of collations can be processed in parallel, with each one having its own distinct validator sample.

I don't really see the point of scalability as being mobile phones; we have SPV for that, and SPV even works well with proof of stake. It's more about (i) preventing the network from being centralized into data centers, and (ii) cutting tx costs from ~$0.03 to ~$0.0003, so that it can _actually_ be used for exciting stuff like micropayments, IoT, identity, reputation, etc. The ten-year roadmap for decentralized technology that I'm seeing is essentially for DHTs, blockchains, etc to converge into some kind of super-structure that combines the benefits of all of them and offers the ability to get whatever tradeoff between cost and other security properties that you want.

I think it depends entirely on the use cases; if we're replacing Paypal he may be right, but if we're talking about blockchain for identity, reputation, IoT, micropayments, etc, then it's a different ballgame...
Also note that Gavin's projections don't take into account a couple of things:
1. It's not about who _can_ run a node, it's about who _is willing to_ run a node. If running a node takes substantial resources, then that will be a pressure toward the use of centralized intermediaries like mining pools and block explorer sites, and the number of nodes in the network will keep declining.
2. Adversaries. An adversary can add ~900kb to the state per block, at a cost of $0.03 per tx * 100 txs ~= $3. So adding 10 gigabytes, preventing most nodes from storing the state in RAM and thus slowing throughput down substantially, costs only $30k.

Technically, you do not actually control your currency while you are a bonded validator, since your currency is locked up for 12 months. Think of it as purchasing a virtual mining rig that pays you your original money back after a year. So, single responsibility principle not violated.

Then the network sees two competing finalized blocks, and nodes get confused. Developers wake up, community agrees that the second finalized block was obviously an attack, and creates a patch to blacklist it. In the original branch, attackers lose $50 million (ie. about the same as the cost of doing a permanent 51% attack in PoW by buying up a lot of ASICs, which would also be resolved by hard-forking the PoW).

Well, I'm not sure. The "KYC 50 people and have them run the chain" approach is definitely the way blockchains could end up working; however, doing this in practice seems to involve a coordination problem that requires a large amount of human legwork to solve, and on top of that you have legal risks disincentivizing people from running a node that might end up being used for decentralized drug markets (whereas PoW/PoS participating is semi-anonymous) and a belief that PoW/PoS systems are more "neutral" or "fair" and as a result can more easily form a schelling point. I am leaving an open mind on this issue at this point; perhaps different industries will take different approaches.

The **whole point** of cryptography is that it is literally the only field in modern civilization where offense/defense costs are massively tilted in favor _of the defender_. Making and verifying an ECC sig takes 0.02s in python and 0.0005s in C++, and yet breaking it takes trillions of years; everywhere else in the world, the story is the exact opposite. Mining is this peculiar innovation that tries to bring the security ratio of cryptography right back to 1:1, and what's more, it even manages to make the defender's side of the story into a tragedy of the commons.
Fundamentally, I strongly dispute that the "cost" of breaking into five well-maintained key storage servers is a single bit lower than the cost of breaking into five large mining centers.
@_date: 2015-11-24 11:21:12
The best way I have found to do it is random sampling: assume that you have N cryptographic identities of some kind, and for a block to be valid require them to be signed by 2/3 of a random ~50-100 identities. This way you still get a statistical guarantee roughly equal to the original guarantee: you can't break it (with 1 - ϵ probability for very small ϵ) unless an attacker has &gt;50% hashpower. The identities in my models tend to be proof of stake slots, but this is completely translateable to a proof of work context using techniques such as Dominic Williams's "puzzle towers", or a simpler expedient like making the identities be the 10000 previous coinbase addresses.

When the company earns a profit, it would destroy shares, and when it takes a loss it would immediately cover it by printing more.
Knowing this, we have the following economic model: suppose that I had portion k of all shares (eg. k = 0.05 for 5%), and suppose that I follow the strategy of maintaining that percentage. When the total quantity of shares go down, I sell shares on the market and take a profit, and when the total quantity goes up I buy more. Hence, suppose the company earns $x in profit, and its market cap is $M. Then, the new market cap is $M - x, and so 5% of the new cap becomes (M - x) * 0.05. I currently have M * 0.05, so I will be able to claim x * 0.05 profit by selling shares (and if the company loses $x then I will have to buy x * 0.05 and thus take a loss). Hence, my expected future profits are equal to k times the expected future profits of the company, and so the company's shares are worth the discounted sum of expected future profits as usual.

Umm, you do realize that private blockchains don't use mining at all, and pretty much all of them are already using some kind of traditional byzantine-fault-tolerant M-of-N consensus? These networks are secure as long as you don't have the situation of more than 33% (if you allow assumptions of synchrony more than 50%) of nodes failing or acting maliciously at the same time.
Edit: this was mentioned tangentially in the thread as "proof of stake"; however, I don't think it's correct to use "proof of stake" as a way of referring to these algorithms, as the weight of each individual in the consensus has no necessary relationship whatsoever to how much "stake" they have in any kind of digital token.

So one simple argument to make is that, because participants in these permissioned systems can be identified, you can actually be sure that the system is **more** decentralized than a PoW or PoS system. Choose 50 people, KYC them, make sure they are employed by completely different entities, and you've got something that's substantially more decentralized than just about every PoW or PoS system that exists in reality.
Another good argument is that because you don't care about cryptoeconomic incentive constraints and can deal with centralization concerns directly, you can make private blockchains both higher-performance and much lower-latency (think finality in 1-2s instead of de-facto 3 min or 1h as is the case for public systems).

Hmm, this part seems implausibly optimistic. Creating a valid Bitcoin block currently takes ~2^70 operations, which with Grover's algorithm can be cut down to ~2^35. Hence, a quantum bitcoin mining ASIC would need to be ~2^35 ~= 34 billion times slower than a classical bitcoin mining ASIC in order not to be faster. Of course, today's computers are 34 billion times faster than those of the 1960s, so with very immature QC compared to very mature classical computing it may well be true, but the probability is imo not nearly close enough to 100% to discount the possibility (I personally would put it at under 50% chance that the first QC that has enough qubits to do Grover's on bitcoin mining will be slower at the job than classical, though that's only a fairly low-information guess).
Also, another technical tidbit:


You can use hash ladder schemes to knock lamport-style signatures to ~1056 bytes with 256-bit security and ~420 bytes with 160-bit security: 
Otherwise looks good. May also be worth explicitly linking to lattice-based cryptography.

I actually think the author is exactly wrong. As in, 180 degrees off base. First of all, blockchain downloading times, really? That's a fairly short-term technical problem; over at Ethereum we have fast syncing to get the chain in under an hour through light client proofs on many computers, and there's some development going on now to knock it down even further (holy grail is 5 seconds with a full light client).
Second, my thesis is that blockchains are successful **precisely because** relying on the so-called "distributed structure" of federated servers is a complete and total failure. No, in practice your homemade website is NOT on the same level as the installation of any large corporation, because (1) your server doesn't have the capacity to handle too many users, (2) you don't have the time or skills to make sure it stays online and keeps running smoothly, (3) if the server is at home, then it's dependent on an even flakier internet connection and if it's on a VPS that's arguably a point of centralization anyway (and you're paying $9/month for it). Requiring ordinary users to maintain a box with 99.9%+ uptime is absolutely unreasonable. Second, as we've very clearly seen with diaspora and other experiments, there is a large centralization pressure for people to join through centralized hubs, and most people end up using even fewer hubs than Bitcoin (or Ethereum) have mining pools. Once that happens, in a real ecosystem (ie. not one by decentralization idealists) there will arise an incentive for these hubs to "embrace and extend" via proprietary features, and then we're back at square one. I would argue that blockchains for web applications are interesting specifically for the reason that they are a decentralized architecture that manages to remedy the uptime concerns while introducing much less centralization that traditional server-based models do.

Theoretically, there can quite reasonably exist a corporation that has ownership over no assets, which uses only its own shares as a currency, and which earns profits purely from the combination of the unique status of its employees and a hard coordination problem (eg. a software consultancy would be in this position). In that case, a corporation would theoretically be completely sovereign in a very real sense: even if a court could order transfer of shares to some other entity or to itself, it would be very easy for shareholders to comply, but then simply coordinate on moving to a new company that copies over the old share allocation before the transfer. A "moderate" version of this strategy, where the company only owns assets less than $X (and has a "forking cost" $Y), would have its governmental losses be bounded above by $X + $Y (which is still pretty "sovereign"; plenty of countries have their gold stored in US vaults and so they're susceptible to US jurisdiction but by a bounded amount).
The even more interesting challenge will be working out the difference between (i) such a corporation in the real world, (ii) such a corporation in the virtual world, where things are currently typically not taxed, and (iii) just a club of people that happens to use a point system for keeping track of who the best contributors are.

Miners are bribeable too. In fact, I have argued that if a bribe is successful, you can even set up the bribe in such a way that it will be cost-free, and it will be the miners that don't accept the bribe that will be punished by the very mechanism that normally incentivizes and secures the blockchain. If you argue "oh, miners have incentives, they got ASIC hardware at stake", then I can point out that we can make the servers groups that also have a strong incentive - eg. rich Bitcoin holders, Coinbase, BCI, etc.


Eh, maybe. My "33 out of 50 servers" suggestion was basically a distillation of DPOS, which Bitshares uses fairly effectively. Now, I do think that slasher PoS with security deposits has even nicer economic properties, hence my preference for it.

You can probably come up with a Chaumian blinding scheme with some central bank that learns no information from the transactions it processes, and that can't run away with any funds because it's bonded by security deposits.

There's a trick that I've been calling "auditable computation", where you can keep a contract off-chain, and allow a third party to submit just the result of the computation alongside a security deposit in exchange for a small fee, and if a bad result submission comes along you can publish the actual code to the blockchain, where it gets checked against a hash and then run on-chain, and if it turns out the submitter gave a bad answer then the submitter loses their security deposit. So your contracts are private 99.9999% of the time, and when they do get compromised you get a nice fat payout out of the security deposit of whoever provided a bad answer. There's also a "sample-and-fallback" approach which is even more robust, and which could actually be applied to blockchains themselves (minus the privacy component) in order to solve scalability.
That's the basic idea.

So, it depends on what you mean by "blockchain". If your definition includes proof of work, then I'm anti-PoW anyway :) But without that requirement, the definition can become almost vacuous: an Apple computer with Time Machine installed is a blockchain, since it stores a history of updates and intermediate states. So is Git. If you require a decentralized updating protocol of some kind, then that is a cost, but not a large one, and the cost will have to be paid anyway if you require architectural fault tolerance. You could even have a centrally issued but globally broadcasted blockchain, providing no security against the operator double-spending but definitely providing proof if they did; this might work well for some intra-corporate use cases. Hence why I prefer not to talk about blockchains at all, except when explaining ethereum for the first time, and instead call them databases or "consensus ledgers" and go straight to fundamentals.
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:41:01
Which is a very reasonable stance to have, even if we (and probably he) disagree.

IMO, the extra security guarantees provided by such devices over just keeping a private key on your computer are quite limited. The problem is that even though the keys are stored on the wallet, and even though the signing process is done on the wallet, you never actually see the transaction that is being signed. Hence, if an attacker successfully takes over your desktop, they can wait until the next time you need to send some BTC, swap the transaction for one that sends ALL of your BTC to them, and let you key in your password and approve, not realizing that the device is sending away everything you have. The one feature that the Trezor has that Ledger does not is a screen so you can see the address and amount. This is still not perfect, as the attacker can swap the address, but at least your losses are bounded to the amount that you were expecting to send.
I see from the article that:


Which is great. However, I think that people massively underappreciate the importance of this feature; without it, you really don't have all that much.

Interest: $229 billion  
Defense department: $596 billion  
Healthcare: $831 billion (yep, the US has [more government health care spending]( per capita than Canada!)  
Social security: $845 billion  


So, this is true, but I have a somewhat less conspiratorial take on it. The US government's debt should really be thought of more as shares. If the government had a debt denominated in EUR or CNY, then it actually would be debt, but then (i) it could all be paid back, and (ii) the government's position would be substantially more precarious. But in reality, the government can print out more USD (issue shares) whenever it wants, and it can absorb USD (share buybacks) whenever it wants, and the whole point is for the quantity of shares to be greater than zero, because the shares getting to exactly zero would imply that the government has earned an infinite profit. So the fact that there are currently 18 billion shares outstanding is not all that interesting; it's a bit dangerous that it's expanding so fast, but not really fully comparable to a family that has credit card debt equal to four times its annual income.

Nubits basically are just a packaged version of a usd/nushares CFD contract that continually rebalances itself so it never expires and it can be traded like a fungible coin. Once you think about it that way the whole idea starts to make much more sense.
Given that the default behavior will be that users want to store bets in USD rather than BTC, making a stablecoin the default seems like a very reasonable way to go. But my stronger recommendation to the Augur team is to be currency-agnostic and allow bets to be performed in any currency that follows the ethereum sub-currency interface. So if you want nubits, you get nubits, if you want tether, you get tether, if you want a BTC sidechain coin, you get the sidechain coin, etc, and any coin can become the base currency for a market later on.

Well, the very interesting part about the relationship between this and Keynesianism is that when you switch from an economy dependent on people working for one specific entity for a large amount of time to a highly fluid and continuous model of micro-labor, the concept of "wage stickiness" disappears entirely, "unemployment" becomes much harder to reason about because nobody is really unemployed - although you may have people that have lots of downtime during some periods, the concept of being "hired" and "fired" disappears as a large event, and a whole bunch of other theorized inefficiencies disappear.
Of course, this won't apply to the entire economy; the whole reason why the 15h/week work movement failed way back then is that it's simply not possible to be productive at all in many jobs unless you heavily dedicate yourself to them, and in many cases that will still apply - in some situations even more than before. But not everywhere.
The one thing that does concern me is that there are psychological factors why people prefer institutional environments: it gives them stability, it gives them a constant social environment, and particularly importantly it gives them a guaranteed sense of progress. I think decentralized economic systems if they are to succeed long-term will need to provide effective substitutes for these needs. Reputation systems may be a large part of the solution here. We may also want to come up with wrappers for economic activities that feel institution-y to just the right extent to achieve those goals, but without actually having the downsides of existing corporations; concepts from tech culture like meetups, hackerspaces, conferences, etc, are likely going to be important.

Do you have empirical evidence that mining is less wasteful than the banking system if you adjust for Bitcoin's current volume of users?
The fundamental difference between the two is that banking clerk waste is _administrative_ waste; it's the kind of waste that goes down as tech gets better. Mining, on the other hand, is a competitive game, like military spending; in order to survive you need to constantly outspend every conceivable attacker. So as technology improves, we cannot expect that mining will become less wasteful.
(Note that the activity of _mining_ is distinct from the activity of _processing transactions_; actually processing and verifying transactions is at most perhaps 0.1% of a miner's computational effort, and the rest is participating in the competitive hash solving game)
The fact is that Bitcoin would be $300M/year cheaper if we just all agreed on 50 individuals in random locations around the world to maintain trusted servers, and required 33 of them to produce every new block and sign it. So you have to really justify what benefits the current approach (where I would wager much fewer than 33 individuals control a majority of mining power, and a large fraction of them are in a single country) has over such a scheme.
@_date: 2016-07-11 23:37:11


I appreciate your hard work here but this one is a bit off the mark; see 
The better point to make imo is that redistributive spending like welfare programs are over half of the [federal budget]( and so even if everything else is wasted on average the loss would be closer to 17% than 50% (17% and not 25% because US government spending is [a third of GDP]( not half). But then on top of that you'd have to pay for roads, education, etc yourself and we have data on how much that costs in countries that implement various policy prescriptions, so even in a "best case" pro-libertarian scenario government taxation disappearing in itself would only make the average person ~10% richer. That said, the harms from regulation are of course unbounded and are probably very high in some cases and negative in others.

Hardware costs greatly dominate electricity costs in the current mining market. Hardware costs are fixed one-time costs, so though there definitely are many miners who are now not mining because of the halving, this preference is expressed in the fact that they created less hardware in the first place, months before the actual halving event. Once the decision to create a miner is made, it only makes sense to shut it down if the BTC price falls so much that mining cannot even cover electricity costs.

They could just use a Ripple-style subjective-consensus ledger if they want; that allows them to create a ledger that's secure according to many people's standards at very low cost.
Realistically, if I was them, and I had a more mainstreamy outlook on things, the main concern that I would have with using mainline ethereum 1.0 instead of a Ripple-style fork are the tx costs - in the modern day and age, people are used to state-changing updates being _free_; even $0.05 is unacceptable.

Ok, let me make this clear. Suppose that portion P of costs is electricity and other running costs, and portion 1-P is fixed costs. Suppose that a given miner, pre-halving, has profit margin D-1 (ie. revenue / costs = D). Then that miner's running costs are P, and their running revenues are D, so the miner would shut down only if mining revenues (ie. block reward * price) drop below P / D of their former value (as this would bring running revenues to below D * P / D = P, ie. below running costs).
Now, look at the halving. The empirical fact is that few miners shut down. This logically implies that for nearly all miners, P / D &lt; 0.5. There are two hypotheses for why this may be the case. One hypothesis, and the one that I asserted in the first place, is that P is low, ie. fixed costs dominate. The other is that D is high, ie. profit margins are high. Furthermore, note that miners don't just have a binary shut down / stay online choice; they could _reduce_ capacity. This further implies that P / D &lt; 0.5 even for the marginal ASIC of most miners.
Suppose that we are in your universe and that P is high, so D has to be high. This means that, before the halving, a miner would substantially increase their profits by having 1000 miners instead of 999. However, if this is true, then it is overwhelmingly likely (in fact, hard to believe otherwise) that they would increase their profits further by having 1001 miners instead of 1000. But they did not do this; the miners have the number of ASICs that we observe that they have, and not more. So unless there is some crazy second-order discontinuity that makes 999 ASICs good, 1000 ASICs substantially better, but 1001 ASICs suddenly substantially worse, D being substantially above 1*, even on the margin, seems to me quite unlikely. Hence, I am quite confident that the hashrate drop is low because for most miners P is low.
\* Note that D-1 is the profit margin, and D is the revenue / costs ratio, so if a mining company has a 10% profit margin, D would be 1.1.

Many of us high-level crypto people often end up on the advisory board of just about everything. It's usually a matter of:
**Guy 1 in XCorp board of directors**: Hey, we should try to get Dr Y! He is highly respected, and will help us look more legitimate.  
**Guy 2 in XCorp board of directors**: Yeah, sure. Jake, wanna set up a meeting?
**Jake**: yeah, sure.  
**Dr Y**: Hey guys, what can I do for you?  
**Guy 1**: Hey Dr Y. We really respect your work and think you are awesome. This is what our project is about. Look, we are disrupting Z, so we're awesome too. Do you want to be on the advisory board?
**Dr Y**: ...
**Guy 2**: No commitment at all, we might ask you a question or two per month.  
**Dr Y**: Yeah, sure. You guys sound cool at first glance, and I do think disrupting Z is a good cause. And saying no would be more annoying because they'll try to persuade me and the whole situation will feel uncomfortable. So sign me up.
**Bitcoin media websites**: Dr Y joins XCorp advisory board!  
Of course, we should all be more careful, and I do try not to "advise" anything that I don't think is at least somewhat interesting. But in general, advisors don't mean much.

In RSA that's true, but in ECC the math for doing signing (ECDSA) and the math for doing encryption (ECIES) are actually different.
Also as Natanael mentioned below, if quantum computers come along and we switch to Lamport, we'll be using signing algorithm that actually can't be turned into pubkey encryption algorithms even in theory.

Putting this into wireless routers and cell phone hotspots would be pointless. Cell phone hotspots are extremely battery-draining, and most people barely know how to use or configure a router. The correct approach is to make this an application that can be downloaded onto a computer or laptop, and acts as a kind of forwarding proxy. This also allows a much higher concentration of potential proxies in dense areas since you're targeting people and not routers.
But I have already publicly stated multiple times that I personally fully support any credible efforts to implement this; I would likely be a very happy customer.

That doesn't work too nicely. Suppose two cases:
1. You have 100 shares of "Jeb Bush will win the 2016 election" in a prediction market which will pay $1 on success and $0 on failure, and each share is now worth $0.20 (20% chance). So you have $20 worth of shares.
2. BTC is worth $200 (just to be clean). You have 100 shares, which will pay 0.005 BTC on success and 0 on failure, and each share is now worth 0.001 BTC. So you have $20 worth of shares. You also have a separate CFD which gives you $1 USD gain per $10 loss in the BTC price (to have this property and for the CFD to be BTC-denominated, the CFD would technically have to be on the _inverse_ USD/BTC rate, but bear with me)
Now, suppose that BTC decreases to $100 in case (2). Your shares are now worth $10, but your CFD gave you $10, so you are still at $20. All good. Now, suppose that Jeb Bush actually wins. Your shares pay out $50, so you get $60 total, NOT the $100 you were expecting.
So you actually can't use a CFD (or any other separate prediction market) to mirror the functionality of a market that's pegged to USD. The fundamental mathematical logic is that using two separate markets constitutes addition, whereas a USD-denominated market, if reasoned about in terms of BTC, is multiplicative over Jeb Bush winning and the USD/BTC rate, and addition simply cannot simulate multiplication.

This was the original statement:


This is the original post that you chose to start defending. When mughat replied with "what you are saying is that you can not have a busniess without a government. That is just a very stupid statement.", you replied "I'm sorry dude, but you're technically wrong. You can't legally operate a business without filing with the government and paying taxes."
Mughat is entirely correct - you can definitely have _a_ business without government, laying aside concerns about how effective the business would be or whether it would have the incentive to stay honest. You did not say he was "legally" wrong, you said he was "technically" wrong - where technically is defined by Google as "According to the facts or exact meaning of something; strictly", and then made the followup that you can't legally operate a business without filing the various forms as an argument supporting the idea that he is technically wrong. You did not _specify_ that you were talking about the legal definition, you specified that you were talking about the _technical_ definition, which is a very different beast, and then used the legal definition to back up your argument about the technical definition. All of the definitions of "business" that I see simply say "organization selling stuff to people" - they have nothing to do with the law.
So I think we're talking about completely different things here.

True, I imagine crackers eventually would need to upgrade to a more complex language model. Perhaps they might have specific probabilities for "\1\2\3..\1\2\3", and then if the model detects that it is at something like "xyz...xy" it could update the probability that the next letter will be a z to something higher. I imagine logistic regression-based classifiers might be involved, although they may be too slow for the application unless they're trying to crack one of the "slow hashes".
The above is all speculation; I'll leave it to the real world to figure out if this strategy is any good (I might run some tests myself too when I have spare time)

If the tax did not apply to people who did not vote for said politicians, I think people here would be quite happy. The issue is that it does - it's an exercise in collective punishment. That's the moral issue that people are unhappy about. It's not an injustice against an abstract concept of "Cypriots", it's about specific individuals - some of which were undoubtedly quite vehemently against everything that happened in the last 15 years. You can argue that injustice against a few people is justified as collateral damage to help the greater number, or that they had a responsibility to vote with their feet, or that property rights are illegitimate in the first place, but then actually make that argument - saying that a collective should get what it deserves is what justifies racism and large-scale war atrocities.

Unfortunately not true. We were at $31.91 for a few days back in June. But it was only up there back then for a few days (in fact, the five-day average of our market capitalization is now [higher than it ever was]( and the fact that the prices went up to $31, as opposed to $20 or $50, was likely more a result of sleep schedules and MtGox delays more than anything else.

If you look at the positions people take when money is at stake, the fact is that the majority of the community thinks Bitcoin is quite likely to fail and collapse to near-zero in the future. Of course, things aren't so clear-cut since the relationship between money and utility is highly sublinear (eg. losing $30,000 does a lot more bad to the average person than gaining $31,000 does good, so most people would not take a coin flip between those two options), but it does show that BTC continuing to go up is not even close to a certainty.

Okay. Say you have a 33% hashrate, and you start double-spending 6 blocks behind. We can write this state as S[0]=(-6). Your job is to get to (0), as if you get to the same length you'll have miners hopping on your chain and you've basically won from there. Then, the state is modified by the rules:
(33% chance) `S[i+1] = S[i] + 1`    
(67% chance) `S[i+1] = S[i] - 1`    
This is basically a biased random walk. We can flip things around and write `P[6]` (the probability of success starting at -6) `= 1/3*P[5] + 2/3*P[7]`, or more generally `P[i+1] = 1/3*P[i] + 2/3*P[i+2]`, rewriting to get `2P[i+2] - 3P[i+1] + P[i] = 0`, with `P[0] = 1` and `P[∞]-&gt;0`. You can show that that's only the case with `P[1] = 1/2`, and you get the sequence `P[n] = (1/2)^n`. Note that the time between blocks does not factor in anywhere in this equation - it's only a concern because you can make 4x more attempts with LTC due to the faster block rate. Thus, at the 33.33% level you get the required 4x security adjustment by adding two confirmations, so you actually need 20 minutes with LTC.
Proof with more spooky math:
Given `P[0] = 1`, `P[1] = a`, the generating function for the probabilities becomes `(ax+1)/(x^2-3x+2)`. Using partial fraction decomposition, we get `(2a+1)/(x-2) - (a+1)/(x-1)`. Since the right side expands into `(a+1) + x(a+1) + x^2(a+1) + x^3(a+1)...`, but we want the limit to approach zero, we must have `a+1=0`. Plugging in to the right side we get `-1/(x-2)`, which expands to `1 + 0.5x + 0.25x^2 + 0.125x^3+...`, as we want.

Thanks for being reasonable about this. I understand that there are good arguments to make these kinds of active efforts to reduce the number of transactions, and you've just made them quite eloquently. The reasons why I don't like this solution are:
1. There is not necessarily a clear correspondence between txout size and utility. Colored coins implementations, for example, can't pass around single satoshis anymore. In the field of environmental regulation, there is the idea that the best way to handle public nuisance issues like pollution is not outright banning certain classes of activity, but rather levying a per-unit "[Pigovian tax]( on the specific thing that is undesirable (eg. grams of CO2, water usage). The equivalent of this in the world of Bitcoin is transaction fees, and was what we were using already. From there, this seems like a step backwards.
2. I don't have that much of a problem with bloating the blockchain or the UTXO set. A major fear I keep seeing (eg. from people criticizing SatoshiDice) is that bloating the UTXO set will make it impossible for grandma on her 2004 Windows XP desktop to use BitcoinQt, but the reality is that grandma should be on Blockchain or Electrum (or even a bloom filter client) already. As for miners, BFL and Avalon can easily add an extra 5 TB of disk storage, 100 GB of RAM and ten times more CPU power to their miners without increasing the cost all that much - their machines cost two to ten thousand dollars already, and it's their job to keep up with the challenges of the Bitcoin network. I don't advocate recklessness here; people should certainly not be able to send billions of single-satoshi transactions flying all over the place. But what some people are pushing towards seems to be the other extreme.


This doesn't make this all that much harder. Now, attackers can just keep passing 5430 satoshis back and forth between themselves. If you have 1 BTC, that's 18000 transactions per block, and assuming you get into one block per hour 432000 per day - a 7x increase over the current situation. This is another strong argument to emphasize fee-based mechanisms over everything else.

Nassim Taleb's whole point in his books is that we just can't know the chance that many events in the real world will take place, so as a result we are forced to resort to various kinds of heuristics. Deliberately targeting potential "black swan" events is one type of heuristic that he advocates. In general, that is certainly not an excuse to blindly invest in every random startup out there; however, given Bitcoin's extreme uniqueness compared to pretty much every other payments "startup" out there, Bitcoin is in quite a strong position.
I'm not disagreeing with any point you're making, I'm just pointing out that there is a substantial amount of prior art on methodologies for figuring out what to do in exactly these kinds of situations.

Interesting talk by Dan Pallotta. He does have his [share of criticism]( although from skimming the article and the comments it does seem like it's heavily based on the "it's immoral to benefit from helping people" line and other emotional moralisms, which leads me to believe that he does actually have a good point (cf. [Paul Graham's heuristic]( that "any idea that's considered harmless in a significant percentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours, is a good candidate for something we're mistaken about").
But there are several economic arguments why I think his general idea is somewhat flawed:
1. From the donor's point of view, all charities are, to some extent, substitute goods. If you are a corporation, then standard profit-maximizing dogma tells you that, if there is an opportunity to spend $49 on advertising to generate $50 of profit, you should do it. In a charity, however, this is dangerously false. The reason is that when you convince someone to donate $50 to you, that is not an isolated transaction that both sides simply forget about; it also satisfies the donor's desire to be a nice person, making them less likely to donate to other charities in the near future. Thus, a $49 fundraiser that raises $50 actually causes a net harm to society. Just how much money does convincing someone to donate $50 to one charity drain from others? That's an empirical question, we don't know. But we do need to be careful.
2. Paying huge salaries - the norm of not paying millions of dollars in salaries to nonprofit executives is actually quite useful. The reason is this: it acts as a filter between people who want to serve the charity primarily because they care about the charity's goals, and people who are in it for financial gain. There's nothing immoral about the latter (I would classify it as morally neutral), but there is a legitimate reason to prefer the first category: [principal-agent problems]( If the goal of the charity is to do X, but the executive director's goal is X, then the two are in perfect harmony, and X will get done to the best of both parties' ability. If, however, the executive director's goal is Y (making money), then there may be circumstances where the director has a choice between alternatives, one of which provides X at the expense of Y and the other provides Y at the expense of X, and the director will go for the Y-maximizing option in the event that the details of the decision can be hidden from the rest of the organization (which is often; do you know _exactly_ why every contractor you ever hired did every single thing that they did). This does not even require malice; it might be a simple matter of choosing between a strategy which works better and a strategy which works slightly less well but looks better on the director's resume. Psychological biases may even trick you into thinking the Y-maximizing choice is also X-maximizing. 
So, yes, be more like a business, but in moderation.

For example (deliberately using simplistic interpretations of both positions to make the point):
Left: government should exercise control over people's businesses! Right: government should exercise control over people's personal lives! Left+right: government should control everything!
Left: amendments 1,3,4,5...9 are good! Right: amendments 2,10 are good! Left+right: all ten amendments are good!

OTR lets the medical center send signed messages that you can verify for yourself, but anyone can easily forge once the conversation is over. Basically the protocol would work like this:
1. A wants to have sex with B.
2. A submits to a medical exam with intermediary M.
3. M sees that A is clean, and initiates the OTR protocol with B in order to prove to B that M has decided that A is clean. Because of the way OTR works, at the end of the protocol both parties reveal their session keys.
4. B is happy, and the two go off and enjoy themselves, happily ever after etc.
5. M also happens to be a mundane plumbing company, and uses OTR for communications with those clients as well. M floods the internet with fake reports suggesting that various customers of both branches are alternately clean and dirty.
6. A's conservative parents, C and D, somehow catch hold of A's report, and confront A about it. A then produces an equally cryptographically convincing report that both C and D are dirty. C and D are bewildered, and resolve to leave A alone.

Well, the problem is that deposit holders in the modern banking system aren't actually depositors. In a full-reserve system, they would be, but in a fractional-reserve system there simply is not enough money to cover everyone's deposits so it is conceivable to imagine situations where not touching any deposits is impossible. So, shareholders and bondholders first, definitely, but if they alone can't cover the debts then some kind of more extreme measure is mathematically necessary. Taxpayers, depositors, or perhaps high-level bank employees; pick one, and you might even need two.

Most hash algorithms today use what's called the [Merkle-Damgard construction]( Essentially, there is an internal function F(X,Y) -&gt; Z, but with the restriction that X, Y and Z are all 256-bit strings. Thus, if you want to hash something that's longer than that, you need to first pad it out to an even multiple of 256, split it into a list of 256 bit chunks, and then run the algorithm:
    def evaluate_hash(chunks):
         state = C
         for chunk in chunks:  state = F(state,chunk)
         return state
Where C is a constant defined in the algorithm.
There is one problem with this algorithm, however: it's vulnerable to length-extension attacks. That is to say, if you know H(s), you can create a suffix z such that you know H(s+z), even if you don't know what s was. This is a problem in [message authentication codes]( which rely on hash algorithms, as, if you as an attacker gain access to a valid message with a valid MAC, you can use the length extension attack to generate a valid MAC for a longer message, even if you don't know the password that was used to create the MAC. However, if you take your hash function as SHA256^2, this vulnerability disappears, as the output does not expose the intermediate state - it only exposes the hash of the intermediate state. For this reason, SHA256^2 has gained some popularity as a more secure hash algorithm than SHA256. In Bitcoin, there is absolutely no place where you are hashing secret data, so theoretically none of this applies; however, many cryprographers have simply internalized using SHA256^2 as a habit to be more secure everywhere just in case, and Satoshi _may_ have been influenced by this.

Alternative semi-libertarian view that you might like:
Income taxes are not the only means of enforcing taxation. There are also sales taxes, property taxes, road tolls, higher electricity/water costs, etc. These taxes are still going to be just as enforceable in the face of Bitcoin (in fact, it is exactly thanks to Bitcoin that some of them will for the first time [be efficiently enforceable at all]( and the other feature that these taxes have is that they improve economic efficiency. Income taxes subsidize not having (much of) an income, whereas sales taxes promote non-consumption, road tolls promote use of alternative transportation, electricity costs promote environmental stewardship, etc. (And property taxes, if levied [only on land value]( don't affect economic incentives at all).
What about taxing the rich? On the one hand, the rich pay indirectly, as people consume less and so many industries receive lower profits. On the other hand, what is the one class of rich people that people don't like the most? The financial sector. Bitcoin removes the need for half the financial sector. With Bitcoin, we have a chance to go back to a full-reserve banking model (ie. people are storing bitcoins in the virtual equivalent of safety deposit boxes, not in banks accruing 0.05% interest), so the banks have much less of our money to play with.

I personally prefer to receive money as a Christmas gift. If I get anything else I always feel bad because I end up just throwing it out since there aren't really any material possessions that I need beyond a laptop and smartphone so the giver essentially wasted money. Even gift cards I end up regifting much of the time.
Unless you happened to discover a new product that you are 90% sure the recipient will really appreciate and simply doesn't know about yet, giving gifts feels like a form of paternalism - you're saying "I'll spend some resources on you, but I can decide better than you can the correct way to allocate those resources to make you happy".
I recognize that other people may have different preferences, so I don't force this strategy on other people by default, but I do publicly say what my beliefs are, and if you agree with me then we can stop trading possessions around and try actually [doing something fun together]( instead.

Quoting for emphasis; this is huge indeed. And it applies beyond just Bitcoin, it's a powerful statement about the internet in general. Before the internet, to a large extent you could argue that violence and coercion were defaults, and you need some kind of artificial force (whether governments, security companies or whatever else) to eliminate it. Now, however we have essentially inverted this fact of social interaction. When you're sitting behind the internet, people can send trollish posts to you, insult your mother or  convince your friends to abandon you, but no matter what anyone does _you can always turn your computer off_. That's it, one magic button, and you have total invincibility. Sure, if you start maintaining an active presence, people can also defame you to attack your reputation or hack your webserver, but even then with the magic buttons of `(')` and Alt+F4 you always have a guaranteed place to go back for safety. Voluntarism is the default.

A lot of people here see this as some sort of exploitation; I personally disagree. Consider the following example. One day, a Martian comes over to your house, and makes you an offer: you work for me for six months, doing hard physical labor, and at the end I'll give you an immortality pill. However, the Martian accidentally leaves his radio, and the next day you start listening to the Martian media. You learn that, on Mars, these immortality pills cost the equivalent of $19.95 and are considered by the local society to be a basic human (Martian?) right. Do you (a) scream about exploitation, or (b) rejoice harder than you ever have before in your life and accept the offer regardless because you're going to be immortal now? That's roughly how it feels when it's December and you've been shivering in the streets for three days straight now, and BNB is not even asking for any labor.
Another way of thinking about it. Everyone agrees that asking one of these people if they want to sweep your floor for $15 is not exploitation; it's giving them opportunity and the first step to getting them off the ground. It's "a job". Wearing one of these sweatshirts is also a job, but one that takes essentially zero effort to do (and you get paid with, well, a sweater). Oh, it's at the cost of their dignity, you say? Well, how about we do the truly respectful thing, and _ask them_ if they actually see it that way. Otherwise, you're the one projecting your privileged upper middle class values on a group of people with completely different priorities. As for the standard argument used against sweatshop owners - translated into this case, "well, they _could be_ giving them plain sweaters with nothing on them", no, they couldn't. You might as well say that the restaurant owners _could be_ making sandwiches for homeless people for free. People, BNB donors included, have different incentives (making money, promoting Bitcoin, etc) and anyone who creates a mechanism to leverage these existing incentives to promote the social good should be praised, even if it's not quite as good as some magical fairy world of "perfect efficiency" where everyone has total altruism for everyone else.

And it is not in a centralized provider's interest to do anything to offend their customers, ergo there is nothing wrong with centralization in the first place.
The reason why we like decentralization is precisely so that we _do not have to_ trust our predictions of people's motivations. Centralized parties can be motivated by a stable and predictable desire for long-term financial profit, but things could change fast. They might suddenly get the desire to maximize returns in the next month at the expense of everything after that to pay for a highly urgent medical treatment, they might get co-opted by government, they might have a gun pointed at their heads by robbers, or they might just decide to screw around with the world "for the lulz".

That paper states that ECC has 128-bit equivalent security. That's different from a key entropy of 128 bits or a key space of 128 bits. I looked at the [SEC specification (3.1.2)]( and there the key generation algorithm mentions nothing about a 2^128 bit key space - it specifically states "randomly or pseudorandomly select an integer d in the interval [1,n-1]" - that's a 256 bit key entropy right there. I think what you are talking about is [Pollard's rho algorithm]( which allows you to crack an order-n discrete logarithm problem in O(sqrt(n)) time, so a 2^256 keyspace does have security equivalent to a perfect "black box" cipher 128 bits strong.

We should really stop talking about collapse like it's a certainty. However, it is definitely a major possibility, and that's why I advocate Bitcoin as a form of diversification. It's not particularly connected to any other economy in the world.

 &gt; A very intriguing, and perhaps unintuitive property of the algorithm proposed is that with increasing bitcoin difficulty, or equally lower target, the search could become more efficient, at least in theory.
No, it won't. If you could, then you could emulate a 10^10 -difficulty solver by running a 10^20 -difficulty solver instead, and so every difficulty would take the same time to crack. I could see the attack's runtime scaling _sublinearly_ with difficulty, so maybe that's what he means, but even if that were the case then difficulty would just keep adjusting upward until mining once again became hard and mining would still work as planned.
I could see this potentially improving run time by some small factor, but in general the whole point of hash functions is that they have enough [confusion and diffusion]( to make any kind of serious boolean-algebraic simplification impossible.

And there is obviously plenty of divergence within each category (eg. some people in the pro-cooperation group support tax evasion, other people in the anti-cooperation group oppose it but believe that the effect would not be large enough to override the positive consequences of an uncensorable currency).

The "10 minute verification" thing is highly overstated. In reality, for nearly all purposes (read: you're not selling irreversible digital goods like game codes or litecoins) five seconds is confirmation time enough.

In order to send money from a given Bitcoin address, you need to have the private key associated with that address. A private key looks like this:
    c4bbcb1fbec99d65bf59d85c8cb62ee2db963f0fe106f483d9afa73bd4e39a8a
Coincidentally (or perhaps deliberately, we'll never know), the format of the private key is exactly the same as the format of the output of the SHA256 hash function, which can take any string of characters as an input. For example, the above private key is equal to `SHA256("correct horse battery staple")`.
Because of the convenience of these features, what some people are doing is making "brainwallets" by generating private keys from custom passwords, and then generating addresses from those private keys. The idea is that if you ever want to recover any BTC that gets sent to that address, you can just regenerate the private key by putting your password into SHA256 again. However, if your password is weak, this is insecure, especially because, unlike most other uses of passwords, SHA256 does not contain a second input for you to put some kind of "username". Thus, I can take a list of the 10,000 most common passwords, make private keys out of them all, and thus instantly clean out all brainwallets with badly-chosen passwords, no matter who created them. Even if your password is moderately good, there is still a decent chance your brainwallet will get swiped. The solution is to have a good password _and_ prepend a username to your password yourself, like this:
    vbuterin:cl3v3rp
Here's a site to experiment with brainwallets:
@_date: 2013-10-12 10:17:22
"baby" is the 75th most common four-letter word in English and "ray" is the 125th most common three-letter word. Hence, the brainwallet together contained log2(125) + log2(75) = 13.19 bits of entropy. I'm surprised it wasn't just caught with a brute force scanner.
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:34:49
Diversification is not just financial. The conservative concept of "family values", for example, is actually motivated by a form of diversification; if everyone has many friends and large extended families, then with very high probability each individual will always have at least one person to turn to in case times get tough. In this sense, many people in third world countries are actually more diversified and thus safe against financial cataclysm than us first-worlders.
@_date: 2013-08-28 07:13:38
The main difference is basically speed. Here's the code for a test I ran: 
(that's using  to do the heavy lifting)
Recovering 20 private keys from the seed and converting them to public keys: 11.48 seconds  
Recovering 20 private keys from the secret exponent and converting them to public keys: 4.20 seconds  
Recovering 20 public keys from the master public key: 4.31 seconds  
So in theory going the `f(k1 + k2)` route is pretty much exactly as fast as the `f(k1) + f(k2)` route, but in practice the way Electrum wallets are designed is that the process of getting keys from the seed is deliberately slowed down by a 100000-fold SHA256 operation, making it 3x slower. You can get around this by precomputing a parameter called the "secret exponent" but very few libraries/toolkits actually expose this feature.

When gold's intrinsic value is less than five percent of its current value, does that really matter?

The computational work must be done by (1) the party trying to spend the funds, and (2) each individual miner. So if you have a 5-100x bigger computer than the average individual solo miner you've already won. And if you are one of 100 people being targeted for blacklisting, if you have a computer at least 0.05-1x as powerful as the average individual solo miner you've won. In practice though, I think it would be very hard to convince miners to filter out even a million addresses from one key.

False. We can make pretty reasonable estimates of Silk Road's transaction volume at any time, and by purchasing on SR you are contributing to that estimate. Furthermore, among your local peer group your purchases from SR are very much _not_ private or anonymous; your friends all know that you're doing it. This is a bottom-up local strategy: rather than attacking national-level public opinion head-on, you're trying to normalize the activity within your peer group, and hoping that it spreads from there. But it serves all of the functions of civil disobedience nonetheless.

Thank you Gavin, I appreciate the tireless effort that you've been putting into Bitcoin for all of these past 4 years.
My concern is that this is a pretty significant change, and it strikes at some genuine disagreements about what we want the future of Bitcoin to be. We already see people talking about whether SD is legitimate or a "DDoS". Back in 2009 to 2011 it was pretty reasonable to just do these kinds of things since the community was a cohesive group, but now as we're increasingly spreading out it's important for us to adjust to the increased size but at the same time retain an open and democratic process. This isn't quite like a Linux distribution where the developer can just say "if you don't like it then don't upgrade, patch it over or fork" - the product being created is the entire network, not each individual's software, so the first two options don't really exist. Communication, including two-way communication where multiple alternatives are presented, is crucial.

False. The whole point of martingale is that you're guaranteed to win if you have unlimited funds. The mathematical contradiction resolves itself through the fact that you have infinite money and you're making finite bets, and so you're putting 0% of your money on the line and making a 0% profit. Zero times any house advantage is still zero.

Not really. The article talks about "Markov chains", which would capture that immediately if it ever got popular.
Basically, the construction involves making a frequency table of all N-letter combinations (say, N=3) in known passwords, and then you repeatedly randomly generate passwords based on the weights in the table.
eg. if you already generated "123he", and your frequency table contains {"hel" : 53, "her" : 9, "he1" : 28} (and nothing else starting with "he"), then with probability 53/90 you then go to "123hel", with probability 9/90 "123her", and with probability 28/90 "123he1". Repeating this algorithm lets you repeatedly generate passwords that look like something that a real user might realistically create, taking into account all of the tricks that people are using automatically. So if "............." became common, the frequency table might look like {"...": 1552, "..a": 9, "..b": 7 ...}, so the Markov chain would very often attempt passwords starting with lots of periods.

Indeed. SR was really several things in one:
1. An online wallet with a built-in mixer
2. A place for merchants to advertise their goods
3. An escrow service
4. A merchant and customer reputation database
5. A source of occasional centralized regulation (eg. the seller fee, the requirement that you cannot finalize early to merchants without enough reputation, the occasional deletions on the part of moderators)
(1) should be organized as a mixer only, not a wallet, sort of like  ; we already know that zero-confirmation transactions are usually not an issue, so it would be much easier to just let users pay directly from their own wallets, perhaps paying to a mixer address as an intermediate step. (3) can be integrated into (1).
(2) can be done by building a protocol on top of bitmessage, and (4) can be done by combining bitmessage + namecoin. For (5), you can allow users to add the public key of a specialized "moderator node", and include a few good moderators by default. And you can always mix and match, eg. by keeping (2) and (4) on BM/namecoin and handling (1), (3) and (5) as an all-in-one centralized service. There are lots of possibilities.

I do not disagree with that. In fact, one of the major reasons why I like Bitcoin is that it let's people store money in secure wallets without banks being involved at all. With fiat currency, you need to participate in the banking system in order to send money over long distances. With Bitcoin, banks would need to earn the public trust on their own merits. Banking would go back to the old model of separate spending accounts and investments.

The problem with the car analogy is that the problem with central banks isn't some tiny one-time flaw that doesn't really affect that many people - it's a repeated, fundamental failure to do their job. With that in mind, I think the most appropriate analogy would be someone coming to the conclusion that Big Agriculture and processed food companies have repeatedly and consistently delivered low-quality products that are terrible for your health and as a result rejecting the food industry entirely and growing all their food by themselves - something which many people actually quite reasonably do for that very reason with great success thanks to modern consumer hydroponics and vertical farming.

If you have actual criticism, I'm always happy to accept it. In fact, I prefer it. Back when I was in high school, teachers would often grade my assignments with ridiculously inflated marks (ie. 100%, 100%, 105%, etc) and after a while it got mind-numbing; I felt that I was in a bubble, being told I'm perfect and never seriously challenged to improve. When I first made it into the final national round of a [Canadian computer science competition]( reality struck. Here I was, for the first time in my life, surrounded by people talking about crazy super-advanced concepts like "dynamic programming" or "Dijkstra's algorithm" as though they were kindergarten tools when I had never even heard of any of those terms. Going from being the "superstar" of a tiny high school of forty to being barely average like that is a serious psychological shock, and a healthy one for anyone to experience. I need to be constantly reminded that I still have a very long way to go.

You are correct in that within the scope of a larger system of free exchange limited resources like water can be used in a way that benefits everyone, since you have to first create greater value in order to obtain it from someone who already has it. However, there are two objections I can think of:
1. Is the initial distribution of water/resources just? For example, you can justify all government activity by claiming that governments are simply the 195 rightful landlords to their respective chunks of the earth, and they have the right to do whatever they want with their property. This is obviously absurd, and the same logic can apply to large-scale "private" resource-holders as well. In fact, dense city-states like Singapore close off fewer natural resources than, say, BP and Exxon, so despite being technically governments they are actually closer to being truly voluntary free-market entities than these corporations. Although you can justify the consumption of resources on the part of every subsequent entity in the chain of ownership, since they bought and paid for it, justifying the original appropriator is considerably more problematic.
2. Some goods cannot be practically contained with effective property rights. For example, take the atmosphere. Evil Polluter Corp Inc may perhaps choose to install some highly-polluting coal power plants which generate them $10 million of profits, but which release CO2 and other pollutants into the atmosphere which costs everyone in the world $1 in medical expenses and reduced life satisfaction. If the damage were concentrated (eg. the CO2 could be chemically processed into solid garbage and then dumped into a landfill), then even if there were externalities it would be in the form of a few people taking a lot of damage, and so they can sue you for infringing on their right to enjoy their property. In the case of the environment, on the other hand, nobody (except maybe a few activists and ecoterrorists) has the incentive to go after you for a measly $1, and so any kind of tax or prohibition against pollution is difficult to enforce. Here, the quality of the air is the common good in question, and pollution is in fact negative-sum - the victims lose hundreds of times more than you gain. And yet it happens.

I would say not really. Encryption is a reversible process, which you can do one way or the other (or both) depending on which keys you have. ECDSA does use elliptic curve operations, but it doesn't do anything reversible - you can't, for example, get the message hash out of the key plus the signature with ECDSA, although you can with RSA signatures. So there is a slight difference, although if you go deep enough I admit it is just a semantic quibble .

Implicit false dichotomy. The third option, that I don't understand why people don't talk about, is for stock exchanges themselves to start experimenting with different rules to limit whatever we decide is undesirable market activity. For example, one proposal I heard is for exchanges to do order matching exactly once every ten seconds, limiting HFTers' ability to try and "swipe" orders. Why would exchanges do this? Because the theory is that unethical traders somehow steal from everyone else on the same market, so an exchange that prevents unethical trading would make ordinary users earn more profit, so the exchange would become more attractive.

That's from your point of view. From the merchant's point of view, those same chargebacks are potentially ruinous. And we see merchants offering discounts for BTC partially because of this already.

"Passing on the cost" isn't a conscious decision that merchants make; it's the result of supply-and-demand mechanics working behind the scenes. The way it works is this: suppose a merchant is selling a product that costs $30 for them to produce and ship per unit, and they are selling it for $32 - a profit of $2 per unit. At some point, they ask the question: do we want to expand production? Perhaps the capital investment is worth it, perhaps it is not, and the merchant acts on the result. Then, chargebacks are suddenly introduced - 1% of customers file a chargeback, costing the merchant a total of $50 in lost funds and bureaucracy. The profit has now dropped to $1.5 per unit. The question appears again: expand production or not? This time, however, the added profit from expanding production is lower, so the merchant is much more likely not to do so. Hence, supply decreases, and price goes up.
The new price will be somewhere between $32 and $32.5, and if we assume small-scale linearity we can see that it will probably be close to $32.5. The reason is that if the new price was, say, $32.1, then that would imply that a 6x increase in chargebacks would make profit negative (since the first 1% reduced profits by $0.4 per unit, by our linearity assumption the next 5% would reduce profits by another $2 per unit down to -$0.4) - an absurd condition for what is supposed to be a market equilibrium. In extremely high-fraud environments - namely, black markets, we can empirically see that consumers do end up footing much of the bill (although producers suffer too; Freakonomics has a nice chapter on how street gang positions are very poor jobs for everyone but the kingpins).
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:21:29
Right, you actually have a good point there. Many people try to make the argument that lower vs higher tax rates are morally neutral because private property rights are socially constructed anyway and 100% taxation is essentially a free society except without private property. But the argument is flawed since in libertarian-socialistan, unlike in social democracies, nobody attempts to prevent you from making a trade of two assets that do not rely on private property at all (eg. bitcoins for a digital music download) without giving a third party a cut. It's very interesting stuff from a philosophical standpoint.

Depends on what you're selling. If you're Coinabul, and you're making tiny profit margins reselling each individual bar of gold, then 10% is wildly excessive and is basically a charity. If you're selling digital goods, however, where your marginal profit is near 100%, then 10% is perfectly reasonable - in fact, given how Bitcoin is easier to use than credit cards (so it has a lower non-monetary "fee" tacked on to the price), you can make a solid economic argument that decreasing prices significantly is actually the right thing to do.

Indeed. The only time you want to deliberately slow things down is when there's a limited keyspace (eg. you're hashing constrained data like timestamps or people's names, or something constrained by human memory like passwords).

Minimum wage is pretty damn hard to enforce over the internet too.

The US military supports Tor in part because it helps weaken other militaries and governments that the US deems oppressive. Similarly, one bank may wish to support Bitcoin because it hurts other banks, or even other governments. I could even see a rogue government quietly promoting Bitcoin specifically as a tool for tax evasion as a form of hostile foreign policy - that particular government may get most of its revenue from offline industries or even natural resources, so it would not be harmed. Alternatively, it may promote Bitcoin as a matter of "if I can't control the world's reserve currency, nobody can". And occasionally, libertarians even manage to rise up to prominent positions in governments (and socialists to prominent positions in business). 
Treating all governments and banks as a unified evil oppressive class is just unenlightened Marxism - faux-Marxism, actually, as Marx himself recognized that the capitalist class was divided (although I'm not aware of him devising a strategy that actually takes advantage of this in any interesting way). Financial geopolitics is a VERY complex beast.

A **finite cyclic group** is a set of elements combined with an operator + taking two elements in the group as inputs and returning an element in the group as an output, and containing an element Z (Z is for "zero") such that:
1. For any X and Y, we have `X+Y = Y+X`
2. For any X, we have `Z+X = X` and `X+Z = X`
3. For any W, X, Y, we have `(W+X)+Y = W+(X+Y)`. From this we can define "multiplication" of a group element: `4*X = X+X+X+X = (X+(X+X))+X = (X+X)+(X+X) = (X+(X+(X+X)))` etc.
4. There exists a number n such that for all G, `n*G = Z`
An ideal finite cyclic group for cryptography would be a "black box"; given two elements X and Y, you can calculate `X+Y` (and maybe `X-Y`, which can be found as `X+(n-1)*Y` at any rate) but you can't do anything else. Importantly, you want the "**discrete logarithm problem**" over the group to be hard (ie. computationally infeasible)
The discrete logarithm problem is as follows: given two group elements, G and X, find k such that X = k*G. It's called a "logarithm" from the relationship with logarithms in arithmetic: `5^6 = 15625`, so `log_5 (15625) = 6`, and here `X = k*G`, so `k = log_G (X)`. If the discrete logarithm problem is hard, then you have a "one-way function": you can calculate `k*G` from k, but not the other way around. One-way anything is great for cryptography.
An elliptic curve is a type of finite cyclic group over which the discrete logarithm problem is hard. That's basically all you need to know about them to understand them on a basic level.
Now, what can we do with these curves? Here's an example protocol: suppose A and B want to talk to each other securely but have never shared an encryption key. How do they establish a secure channel? You do this:
1. A and B agree on an elliptic curve and one specific element of that curve, call it G (with `G != Z`)
2. A generates a random `k ϵ [1,n-1]` and finds `P = k*G`
3. B generates a random `m ϵ [1,n-1]` and finds `Q = m*G`
4. A sends P to B, and B sends Q to A.
5. A calculates `m*P = m*k*G`
6. B calculates `k*Q = k*m*G`
Tada, A and B now have a shared secret value that they can use as a key for encrypted messages. The attacker only sees G, P and Q. If he could calculate discrete logarithms, he could extract `log_G (P)` and `log_G (Q)` and calculate `log_G (P) * log_G (Q) * G` to get the secret key, but since he can't he has no way of doing so. Note that it is conceivably possible to have a finite cyclic group where discrete logarithms are hard but the specific problem of finding `ab*G` given `a*G` and `b*G` is easy; however, elliptic curves also satisfy the **computational Diffie Hellman security assumption**, which specifically states that this is indeed hard to do.

But people CAN'T quickly automate checking if all the doors are unlocked. Checking one person's door is a medium-to-high cost process. You need to go through a few billion hashes to run through bad passwords, and trillions of trillions more for the medium-quality ones.

The problem with the 97.6% address is that even though the potential winnings are so small but the house's rake, and transaction fee, is still the same. If you want to give yourself a 97.6% chance of winning, you have two ways of doing it:
1. Send 0.1 BTC (for example) to the 97.6% address. If you "win" (97.6% chance), you get back 0.1004 - 0.0005 = 0.9999 BTC, and if you lose (2.4% chance), you get nothing.
2. Send 0.011 BTC to the 85.4% address. If you win, great. If you lose, send another 0.089 BTC. Here, your situation is:
* (73.02% chance) 0.011 * 1.147 + 0.089 - 0.001 = 0.10161 - 0.001 = 0.10061 BTC
* (24.86% chance) 0.011 * 0 + 0.089 * 1.147 - 0.001 = 0.10208 - 0.001 = 0.10108 BTC
* (2.11% chance) you lose, 0 BTC
Notice how the structured bet is actually superior to the plain old 97.6% bet in every way, despite the double rake and the double transaction fee. This happens because SatoshiDice's fee structure is rather mathematically inelegant - ideally, you should be paying per unit entropy (ie. rake = -log2(probability of winning) ), not per bet, and because the game does not work that way it leaves open the door for these kinds of tricks.

I disagree. The fact of the matter is that Bitcoin got where it's at largely on the back of the idealism of its community. Yes, the "buy in now and it'll be worth 10000x in five years" aspect was also present, but if the ultimate appeal of Bitcoin was nothing more than becoming yet another paypal with a tiny incremental improvement in efficiency it would ultimately have gotten nowhere. The suggestion that you can construct a community on top of nothing more than a potential 3% savings for customers and merchants is ludicrous; it sounds like something out of an absurd interpretation of "homo economicus." Real excitement, dedication and community do not work that way. Sure, you can frame credit cards and Paypal's 3% as a terrible injustice and get some of that small fraction of the population that actually care about such issues, but it takes focusing on the big picture ideals - decentralization, freedom, privacy, unrestricted borderless commerce, and yes, practically speaking, even the ability to evade governments, to break through to the early adopters that will ultimately be driving and funding the road to the mainstream. That step will undoubtedly require a "legitimate" face of Bitcoin to appear at the same time, and I am glad that that we are seeing businesses like Bitcoin Central and Tradehill taking bold steps to getting us there. However, you cannot focus on one to the exclusion of another; the ideological and the practical are _both_ necessary drivers to get Bitcoin to reach its full potential.

Sorry to disagree with you here somewhat, Erik.


That's actually false. There's a long math-heavy explanation about this in Bitcoin Magazine (issue 13 I believe); essentially, if you try to actually calculate how secure N confirmations are against an attacker with X% mining power,  the chance of success can be calculated to be (X / (1-X))^N - the block interval shows up nowhere in the calculation. Hence, six 10-minute confirmations and six 1-minute confirmations provide essentially the same level of security.


One of the major use cases of Primecoin (1 minute block time) is actually that it lets you move money between exchanges for arbitrage very quickly, as exchanges wait for 6 confirmations for security. Also, many websites (eg. SatoshiDice) wait for 1 confirmation before acknowledging a payment, so Primecoin and Litecoin win out somewhat there.
Also, you correctly point out the black swan technical risk - if the Bitcoin blockchain forks because of some crazy bug in the bitcoind source code, or if one of many other unforeseen things happen, Litecoin may well be unaffected. It sounds extremely unlikely, but then again most people thought the 2008 financial crisis was extremely unlikely.
So all in all, I think altcoins are fine at the relative price level they have toward BTC.

Pure charity is as unnatural as pure "selfishness", whatever that word even means. The reality is that human beings are driven by a complex set of motives, and we need to create institutions that take those motives into account. To take another example, many charity people keep saying that it's much more efficient for people to get a job and donate the money than to volunteer in a charity directly because the average person does not have the expertise needed to use their time well. The problem is, people keep volunteering. Why? Because donating your money is a one-time act; you throw in $1000, and never see it again - you don't even see evidence that your specific dollars are doing anything (except for those charities that match individual donors with specific families). Volunteering, on the other hand, is an ongoing activity; the combination of engagement, working for a good cause, and interaction with other people with like-minded views makes it _fun_. Even charity volunteers are partially motivated by their own desire for entertainment, and charities simply have to take this into account. Same with BNB. They, and the donors which they rely on for funding, are motivated by the desire to support Bitcoin, oppose government, oppose war and help poor people all at the same time; this is the best strategy they have for supporting all of these objectives at once. And yet we criticize them for taking a half-step while not criticizing the 90%+ of the US population that is doing absolutely _nothing_ for any of these causes.

In my experience people in the real world are far less stale and boring than you seem to think; in fact the only group that really does fit that stereotype is people in authority. If you want to succeed as an incrementalist, then yes, you need to approach the people who are already in charge and choose your words carefully to make them happy. However, that is not the only path. Socialism, for example, spread through nothing but romanticizing its ideas to the public and lower class, and many leading socialists had nothing to say to the rich other than "lie down so we can eat you faster". And yet, as an ideology it succeeded massively.
I think Bitcoin's great success will be the way that it carefully struck a balance between both sides. On the one hand, we have people and businesses talking to regulators and trying to make the regulators happy. On the other, we have crypto-libertarians and "dread pirates" on Tor talking about how to make the regulators irrelevant. Similarly with banks and corporations. And yet we benefit from both. What we need is to find that subset of rhetoric which manages to positively target one without offending the other; for example, "freedom" sounds very nice to the idealists and simply neutral to the pragmatist as long as it is not overused. Same with "privacy", and even "anonymity" if you couch it with "legitimate" examples like people in oppressive regimes (_every_ politician believes that their regime is not the oppressive one, and so will automatically think that you're talking about those _other_ evil regimes and not them - that's the reason why this strategy works so well to the point that it even has the US military basically negating the privacy-eroding efforts of some of the other branches of government by supporting Tor). On the business side, "efficiency" works quite well. "international" and "borderless" are actually the best; to the corporate, they have the "yay, more profit for me!" connotation, while the idealist hears "screw you, arbitrary lines on a map drawn by three hundred year old wars!". Think of it as a 2D optimization problem - a clever balance between both sides in order to maximize both.

As I understand it, one of the features of the site is that it will have no hot wallet, so it won't be trying to constantly match the sum of all of its users' positions on MtGox. If this is no longer the case and you changed it, then I retract this point. If not, this necessarily means that, if players' trades do not magically happen to be in equilibrium with each other, some of players' positions are going to be against Bitfinex itself. This is a bucket shop. It also means that your profits are not guaranteed, and sudden up or downswings in the Bitcoin price can wipe out not only your profits but even some of your reserve capital.
Furthermore, the fact that you can just apologize and disappear in such a situation, as has happened many times here, gives you the incentive to maximize your risk of falling into insolvency, because the downfall for yourselves is limited by the zero floor while the windfall for yourselves if the price happens to go in the opposite direction is uncapped.

Basically, there is an operation + that takes two public keys, and this operation is nicely compatible with the standard arithmetic + on private keys. Specifically, letting f be the function that takes a private key and gives the associated public key:
    f(K1 + K2) = f(K1) + f(K2)
Now, let R be a function which takes an input and returns pseudo-random numbers (eg. SHA256). A deterministic wallet works as follows:
    privkey(seed,n) = seed + R(n)
    mpk = f(seed)
    pubkey(mpk,n) = mpk + f(R(n)) = f(seed) + f(R(n)) = f(seed + R(n)) = f(privkey(seed,n))
`seed` is the secret that the wallet is generated from, `mpk` is the "master public key" that gives the watch-only wallet, and `n` is the index of your address (eg. set `n=2` to get the second address from the deterministic wallet, `n=3`. There are a few extra steps, but this is the gist of it.

Actually, no, it's not easy to check. I'll copy my argument from above:


I feel like your problem is that you're thinking of security as a binary property - something is either secure or it's not. This is a bad way of thinking about the issue IMO; in reality, 99.99% harm reduction is often 99.99% as good as going all the way there. And 99.99% harm reduction is precisely what I'm offering. I can see why taking the purist position of "use ultrasecure computer generated passwords or nothing" feels like a noble thing to do, but in practice I think that it will just lead to people giving up and continuing to use utter crap for their passwords.

It removes the incentive to deposit money in bad banks, is the idea. Currently governments have too much incentive to bail out any bank that's at any risk of going bankrupt with taxpayer money, so the risk of dealing with a financial institution that's being irresponsible with their money is externalized onto all of society.

My parents and grandparents always called me Виталик, and when I moved to Canada with my parents in 2000 I simply mentally transliterated the name to English as Vitalik and started using it on my school assignments. On my Canadian passport I am still "Vitali" (and Виталий on my Russian), but by the time I started developing my professional identity both around Bitcoin and my various programming projects in high school (this was in 2011) it was simply too late; everyone already knew me as Vitalik, and I would raise fewer questions if I simply continued using it. I intend to change my passport name to Vitalik as soon as I can since the discrepancy is now becoming too much of a liability. Too bad I can't change my birth date too :( (legally it's January 31, but in all timezones that I spend my life in I was born on January 30)

False. The security coming from the number of blocks comes from the properties of the random walk distribution, where the probabilities depend exponentially on the number of steps, not the number of minutes. Assuming a pool tries to double spend Litecoin and Bitcoin with the same hashrate % every block, they will succeed 4x faster with Litecoin than Bitcoin, but shifting your acceptance threshold up from 6 confirmations to 7 is way more than enough to make up for that.

This is definitely an interesting area of research. The most challenging part is probably how to reward work that can't be explicitly measured or whose need can't even be anticipated. Bitcoin has its army of steely-eyed geeks, but the next corporation might not. And human involvement is necessary for survival; even something as simple as Bitcoin needed human intervention in 2010 to stop an attacker from creating 2^64 new currency units out of thin air. Sure, once APIs advance another 5 years, a Skynet corp will be able to use its profits to purchase new satellites. But will that corp be able to (1) adapt to changes in APIs, (2) locate new suppliers and evaluate their merits against existing ones, (3) decide whether or not it should expand to serve the Lunar and Martian markets yet? Those are the hard challenges here. Bitcoin can because it does very little in-house; after all, it's just a currency. But even now, after 4 years, no one has figured out how to make BTC reliably track any kind of real-world information other than timestamps, when a coin whose supply rate is dependent on the exchange rate with commodities would be so massively beneficial; so there is still a very long way to go.
However, now that we have crypto-money, one solution involves building on that. We can have a corporation that lets people invest into it in a decentralized way (eg. using secure multiparty computation to generate private keys, as multisig would be prohibitive at large scales), and then to gather real-world data it can simply ask all of its investors and take the weighted median. You also only reward those who are not too far from the consensus, so as to encourage people to give the right answers. Thus, you have a corp that knows the weather, who won the presidential election, and so on. Plugging in commodity prices is harder, as there is a strong incentive for shareholders to all get together and cheat there (eg. if BTC was pegged to the USD, miners would all claim that the bitcoin's value was shooting past $10000 so that the system would let them print more); however, once we have crypto-markets through Ripple and colored coins the only way to cheat would be to actually fix market prices, LIBOR-style.

1. Blockchain and Electrum are my favorites, Blockchain is the easiest to use since you don't need to download anything
2. Mining with nonspecialized computers (ie. FPGA/ASIC) will give you very little return these days. If your landlord is a person (as opposed to a corporation), it even gives so little return that it's not worth the risk that they'll subconsciously price in your high electricity usage anyway.
3. Depends on your country. USA - Coinbase is quite convenient (they have their own online client too, if you want to use it), BitInstant if you want to buy with cash. Canada - Cavirtex. Europe - I heard good things about BitStamp.

Private keys are numbers. They look like this:
    c4bbcb1fbec99d65bf59d85c8cb62ee2db963f0fe106f483d9afa73bd4e39a8a
Every private key is associated with an address (specifically, addresses are derived from private keys, but you can't derive the private key from an address). For example, deriving an address from the above key gives:
    1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T
To spend money that has been sent to one of your addresses, you need to plug the associated private key into a special mathematical function to generate the transaction. If you want to play around with private keys, addresses and transactions, there's a neat tool to do that [here](
Whenever you generate a new address, what you're actually doing is generating a new private key and then deriving an address from it. If you're using the Bitcoin-Qt client, the private key gets saved in your wallet.dat so that it can be extracted later when you need to actually spend your own money. If you lose your private keys (ie. you lose the wallet.dat), you no longer have the magic number that you need to generate transactions that spend from that address, and so your bitcoins are basically lost forever since nobody can spend them. And if someone else gets your private keys (ie. they grab hold of your wallet.dat and you didn't turn on the option to store it encrypted), they can spend your bitcoins themselves. So you should encrypt your wallet, but then copy it to a few different places (eg. phone, USB key, online backup) to minimize both the loss and theft risk.

That many Bitcoin developers have a dim view of SatoshiDice's loss notification mechanism is a pretty clear fact, and I provided jgarzik's statement that "bitcoin has never ever been a micro-transaction or micro-payment system" as some evidence (if 1 satoshi is not a microtransaction then by definition nothing is). This is a weak justification in itself , but if you add in the other developer discussions the attitude that Bitcoin should be used for payments and payments only is very real. And I did provide arguments from both sides; my overarching point was that _this is controversial_, not my own viewpoint.
As for many of the "factual inaccuracies" (to be precise, omissions) in my article pointed out here - that I did not mention that this is a changeable setting, or that it's only a change to transaction relay rules, or that it's intended to fight transaction spam, I actually did mention each and every one of those things in the article (the initial version I wrote 24 hours ago, that is; now I've made them clearer). Maybe not sufficiently clearly, but I feel like a lot of the reactions were from people who did not read past the title.
If you can clearly mention more accuracies, I'll change my mind about this, but at this point I'm not seeing them.
I genuinely appreciate the criticism, and have made a substantial number of clarifications and edits. I'll even consider staying out of controversial topics more in the future. At this point, I still agree with most of my words 24 hours ago though.

Normal accounts are secure because they have usernames and passwords, so you can only attack one user at a time. Default brainwallets don't have this property, which is why they are less secure.

On average, making an elliptic curve public key takes 255 point doublings and 128 point additions. A point addition takes five subtractions, three multiplications, a modular inverse and three modular reductions. A point doubling takes four multiplications, three subtractions, a modular inverse, two doublings (x -&gt; 2 * x), three modular reductions and a tripling (x -&gt; 3 * x). Each of those computations is with ~80-digit numbers. The most difficult are the inverses and modular reductions, which should take around 6400 steps each (multiplications take around 1000 with the fast fourier algorithm). Thus, you're looking at around 30000 one-digit operations for an addition and 35000 for a doubling. Thus, all in all you need 35000 * 255 + 30000 * 128 ~= 1 million steps to make an elliptic curve public key. And you would need to make exactly zero mistakes along the way.

Actually, there are some "libertarian" aspects of Bitcoin that you certainly can talk about in a presentation to government. For example:
1. Silk Road. Many people would like to "legalize and regulate" drugs; the fact is that SR actually does a pretty darn good job of making the drug market safer. Because everything is done over the internet, people can get drugs without risk of getting knifed in a bad drug deal, and SR has a reputation system, so SR dealers are _far_ less likely to give you drugs with poisonous impurities that dealers on the street, who have no incentives beyond extracting as much money from you as possible.
2. Gambling. Unlike the fiat currency online gambling industry, which is fraught with fraud, Bitcoin's online gambling industry is actually very reliable and well-regulated with ideas like "provably fair gambling", which make it impossible for the site to quietly "load the dice" in its favor. We're literally seeing textbook anarcho-capitalist concepts like certification agencies emerge here. See [ for more details. Consumer protection agencies like things that reduce fraud, so if you're talking to one this is a great point to bring up.
3. Violating other countries' laws. There are plenty of Western government officials who support people's ability to evade their governments in places like Iran and China; the fact that Tor is over 50% US military-funded is great evidence of this. Similarly, Bitcoin can be used to fund Wikileaks, Edward Snowden, Chinese dissidents, etc.
Not all government officials would appreciate these arguments, so use your discretion; however, there are plenty who do, and these are great defenses to pull up in addition to "it's also used for innocuous charity stuff and restaurants" if they bring up the points.

Not really. Now: AM has 40 TH/s, rest of world has 120 TH/s, AM gets 25% of income (to simplify the numbers)
Suppose AM goes up to 80 TH/s. Then, AM gets 80 / (80 + 120) = 80/200 = 40% of income. So not quite double but still significant growth.
Suppose AM goes up to 1000 TH/s right now. Then, AM gets 1000 / 1120 ~= 89% of income. So the theoretical cap is 99.999...%, not 51%.

I disagree with their perspective on the core bitcoin wallet. From a fragility perspective, having one implementation is a horrible idea - there should be at least five implementations, written separately, for the network to be truly stable and robust. With one implementation, errors are copied - except when they're not, so you are much more vulnerable to black swan consensus failure risk like what happened in March.
But that's not the point. Dark Wallet is not a miner, it is a wallet. Pretty much no wallets actually use bitcoind, and for very good reason - requiring the client to download and process a 12GB blockchain is a deal-breaker for many people. So I fail to see how any of the political wrangling around Bitcoin mining affects Dark Wallet's architectural decisions in any way.

Idiot (referring to Andy Greenberg). And I don't say that often. The primary way we have of regulating these kinds of sites is not marketing them, but if we can't do that then I guess we'll have to go to level two - not marketing people who do market them.
And if you're a libertarian but through some twisted and desperate logic you support this site, keep in mind that this is not abolishing government. It's _universalizing_ it.

One question I have that I haven't found an answer to: given that a and b are so neatly set at 0 and 7, why did the coordinates of the base point (Gx, Gy) have to be random? Why couldn't the standard have chosen to make the base point be, say, the point with even y at x=-3?

I used to feel that way too. But the more time I have spent around Bitcoin the more I have realized that trendlines do in fact have some merit. The fact that the price has so precisely bottomed out right along the two-year trend line, for example, is, mathematically speaking, highly improbable in a random walk. And then the fact that everyone else uses them makes them a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent.

Well, of course, with a bad password you're screwed no matter what you do. I'm not arguing against that. I'm arguing in favor of medium-to-high security passwords (ie. fairly secure but still memorable) combined with usernames.
I'm not going to waste time calculating entropy bits; we don't really have good sources there, and it feels like those numbers are based more on speculation than reality. The basis for my arguments is simple.
1. Account systems with usernames and passwords tend to be secure if people choose passwords responsibly.
2. Bitcoin brainwallets currently seem to be somewhat weaker than such systems, especially if taking into account the fact that Bitcoin users are more technically skilled.
3. Bitcoin brainwallets with prepended usernames are equivalent to username+password account systems in security
Therefore, prepending usernames is a good idea, and given people choosing decent passwords it's even good enough. That's my logic.

Indeed. One idea that I like is to think of unrestricted cryptography, including cryptocurrency, as a sort of 21-st century version of the Second Amendment. Guns in the 1780s made government oppression less likely by giving people the tools to resist militarily; now in the 2010s, with government owning tanks, full-body armor suits and nukes that particular function of the amendment is less potent, but PGP, Tor and Bitcoin are beginning to accomplish the same function by giving potential victims of government overreach the ability to prevent themselves from being detected in the first place.

Interesting argument. But I disagree with it. The rebuttal is the standard "the pie is not of a limited size" argument; there is not a fixed number of lifeboats out there. If we were all 2x wealthier, we would all stockpile more food and provisions as insurance, and we would all be better off in case of an emergency. There definitely are some commodities that are zero-sum (eg. land, money, social status) (technically those last two are redundant because money, especially zero-intrinsic-value cryptomoney, is really just a kind of social status, but that's another discussion), but in most cases the cost of survival increases very sublinearly with the general level of wealth in society. Right now, many people in first world countries can diversity with a few homes and resource stockpiles in a few different countries. A thousand years ago, that choice was available to only a few thousand kings and noblemen.
I would say the correct division is between "wealth as a means of getting physical resources" and "wealth as social status as an end in itself"; the latter is zero-sum, the former is not.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:38:53

I agree that it is about the seizure of the .com domain. However, I think you're not understanding why the seizure of the domain is relevant. It's not relevant because it is in itself an example of government overreach; by itself it probably would be, but given that the underlying product that the site's whole purpose was to represent has already been neutered, the actual consequences of the takedown will be trivial.
As I mentioned above, the ONLY reason why this thread even exists is that "the domain seizure is just an "official confirmation" that LR is in fact being taken down."

The value of labor is currently falling largely as a result of globalization, a temporary process which should eventually end once we have achieved close to full inter-country equality (as opposed to intra-country equality, which will never happen). Although this is bad for people in developed countries, for people in East Asia, India and increasingly Africa it is a godsend. As surprising as it is, world income inequality has been [consistently falling for the past 40 years]( Bitcoin, with its unfettered internationality, also accelerates this process, and does so in a more efficient way because you don't need to have middlemen anymore.


False in general. See: restaurants, grocery stores, nearly any other kind of shop on the street, farmers, web hosting providers, authors, etc. Of course, there are industries where monopolies do occur; the question is, what makes monopoly more likely and what makes competition more likely? The answer is usually twofold: economies of scale (large companies are sometimes more efficient) and barriers to entry (high startup costs). Bitcoin pushes high startup costs way down (notice how any 12 year old kid can now make a gambling site).


I don't think these are a problem in the modern world to be honest. Transportation is much cheaper today, and the internet makes it easy to find one's way in any new city, so "if you don't like it you can leave" applies with full force. Cities are essentially close to a competitive market (at least if you're not a landowner).

Suppose that users have a total of 10000 BTC and $50000 USD deposited in your service. In order to have zero exposure, you must have 10000 BTC and $50000 USD in reserve. Now, let's say that on one particular day one rich depositor decides to sell 6000 BTC (entirely possible thanks to the 10x leverage), and everyone else cancels each other out. Then, your users' net positions are 4000 BTC and $130000 USD. But your reserve is still 10000 BTC and $50000 USD. Since you do not have a hot wallet, you cannot automatically correct this imbalance at an exchange - you have to wait to manually do it, which you perhaps do once a day; I don't know exactly. But suppose that before you can rebalance your reserves the price of a bitcoin drops from $13.33 to $10 (worse has happened; see [Aug 17-19]( How much, in USD terms, do you owe users? 4000 * 10 + 130000 = $170000 USD. How much do you have? 10000 * 10 + 50000 = $150000 USD (perhaps slightly more due to earnings from the trades, but not $20k more). You are now insolvent, and therefore running a fractional reserve whether you like it or not.

Agreed. There exist opportunities to spend $10 to get $50 in profit, and every business should strive to find them. But there also do exist opportunities to spend $49 to get $50 in profit, and the idea that better opportunities do exist doesn't take away from the fact that you have a choice sitting in front of you of whether to spend $49 to get $50 or not. For a business, the answer is yes. For a charity, no. Results should be measured according to not just what is seen, [but also what is unseen]( If you get $50 for $49 at the cost of leeching off $10 elsewhere, that should be avoided.
As for the high-paid salaries, yes, I agree, not everyone is willing to go into the minimalist lifestyle that we might be happy with for the greater good, and that should not stop people from participating. $100k for someone qualified is definitely reasonable; $2 mil is not, even if that $2 mil CEO brings in another $3 mil of donations (also because of the aforementioned crowding-out effect). So I think we're in perfect agreement; it is indeed a matter of finding the right balance.

The only kind of attack I can see possible is malicious attackers making the application show their site as accepting Bitcoin. I don't do anything unsafe with public input; it's just wget | sed and string comparisons.

This is unfair IMO. I think people do not appreciate that Coinbase is operating in a very difficult industry - they are exchanging a reversible payment medium (bank wires) for an irreversible payment medium (BTC), and most companies that have even tried such a thing have collapsed in a heap of chargeback fraud. Coinbase is one of the few that is actually coming through and succeeding. Only a few months ago, they were not offering instant withdrawals at all, because they quite reasonably felt that giving instant BTC would open up too much opportunity to cheat the system. Now, they are experimenting with ways of letting people do that, and people are complaining that their partial solution is not a perfect one. Last time I checked, 30% is strictly greater than 0%, and no one complained back when the feature didn't exist.

Shouldn't the minimum transaction output size be significantly reduced at this point? It was 0.01 BTC back during the $10-$15 days, but now the same amount is worth over a dollar. I feel like we've let a lot of these settings slowly creep up to values much higher than intended over the past couple of months because of the rising price, and if either the price fell back to $10 or the settings were changed to compensate the problem would go back to being just as minor as it was in 2012.

That's a bit of a logical fallacy there; you're jumping from (A -&gt; B) to (B -&gt; A). You still haven't defended the claim that something being morally justified should be based on whether or not something is legally justified. Also, when you said "Morally justified? Perhaps, but he shouldn't be the one to make that call", you literally contradicted yourself, as "morally justified" and "should" are synonyms. Either the attempted murder is "perhaps morally justified" or it isn't; you can't say "maybe he should have done it but he certainly should have left the decision to someone else". 
 I'm not defending DPR's attempted murders (especially the January one really disappointed me personally); just pointing out the flaws in logic here. If you wish to promote obedience of the law as a moral norm that exists alongside (or even supersedes) other considerations in deciding the moral status of the actions in question, you need to provide arguments for that explicitly.

Do they? First of all, saying that they pay "the same" sales tax is misleading; the homeless man living on $1000 per year is paying $50-$250 at most, whereas the millionaire is paying millions. Even if you are talking about percentages, however, I would say that the homeless man spends much more of his effort outside the formal economy (eg. by squatting, relying on friends, collecting from untaxed food banks, using public libraries) than the billionaire, and so as a percentage of his _actual_ expenditure even his percentage is much lower. Finally, and this is an often overlooked point, it is always possible to make a method of tax collection more fair on the poor. It is simple: pay a portion of the tax revenue as a universal citizen's dividend. Since wealthy people do consume resources much more than the poor in absolute terms, you can use this mechanism to adjust the tax to be completely neutral on people around a certain consumption threshold.
The one practical qualm I do have is the question of just how much revenue these kinds of mechanisms will be able to raise; I personally would just like a city (preferably something like Blueseed or that new free city in the Caribbean) to implement them and find out.

But there is a de-central authority - "the people". There already has been one incident in which MtGox agreed to move their entire balance to a single address to prove that they were maintaining a full reserve. The moment the first fractional reserve institution in the Bitcoin community pops I can see it becoming an industry standard for banks to periodically prove that they have at least a certain percentage of deposits stored as a BTC reserve.
Of course, such a thing may never happen, and greed on one side and negligence on the other may win out instead, but the fact that the Bitcoin community has already managed to secure 80%+ cold storage policies from most exchanges after the past year's string of thefts gives me hope.

Correct. This is why I say that because brainwallets have no builtin concept of username you're intrinsically checking everyone's wallets at the same time. Your cracker can test p and it will catch the wallet if it exists no matter who made it. However, if you prepend usernames, then the dynamic changes. The cracker does not just need to check p it needs to check vbuterin:p Natanael_L:p gavinandresen:p and so forth for every username it can find. If the cracker has a vendetta against me in particular, then yes, it adds no security. Otherwise, it does increase the space of passwords that the cracker needs to check by a factor equal to the number of people that use this scheme.


My username: 20 bits (there are 1 million BTC users, and I don't know of any other with the same username)
12-character password: 36-72 bits depending on level of randomness
So that's 56-92 bits already. The low end of that is pretty tough to crack (although ASICs can do it); the high end goes above the 2^80 threshold that is considered acceptable for some cryptographic protocols.
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:45:54
Don't bother with the 12 words stuff; [studies show]( that Electrum-style passphrases are not actually easier to memorize per byte of entropy than your own passwords. Instead, make your own brainwallet.
    &gt; pybtctool sha256 "username:long_password_here"
    9d00a897b747963b04a1b2b4aa7ac18fd746b27de629ef82f990efe116479a22

1. Prepending your username is **mandatory**. The reason why brainwallets are hacked more often than normal accounts is that attackers are essentially working on cracking everyone's brain wallet in parallel. Prepending a username solves this.
2. **Don't** use a phrase in a book, even an obscure one. But do take a few lines from a song or a book and convert them into your favorite leetspeak/semi-english encoding (eg. bDtAfLf1So1b+cT-&gt;YfL1/2Ee), and use it as part of your passphrase.
3. Combine multiple significant numbers from different aspects of your personal life. Spouse + internal name of company project + favorite Bitcoin site works + a few random symbols works decently well.
I'm planning on soon coming up with a secure+memorable brainwallet algorithm; watch out for that.

Historically speaking, this is the part where things get somewhat eerie. If Gox breaks past $166, there will be no anchors between that and $266, so we can expect dramatically increased volatility in that range, similar to what happened once Bitcoin broke past $15.4 in 2012. The $200+ zone will be particularly unstable. If we get that high, I expect $250 to provide major resistance, and once we get past that we will have broken through the gates. $266 will put up a bit of a fight, and once we get past that expect rises and falls of 10-30%+ daily. The only point of resistance will be $1000.
Or, alternatively (and, as the market seems to think, more likely) we could just see $163 as our new peak and then descend back to the $120 to $150 range (on Gox) for a while.

How does, say, Tradehill's Prime exchange for institutional investors, interfere with the existence of Silk Road?
In my opinion, it doesn't - in fact, the legitimate businesses actually serve to provide cover for the more disruptive ones. If the Bitcoin economy was just onions, then buying bitcoins (which would only be possible with localbitcoins) could immediately get you flagged as suspicious by law enforcement. It could survive, but it would be much weaker. From the agorist point of view, it would be more effective to remain as unthreatening as possible while laying the groundwork for an even more effective resistance in the years to come than to just take the current set of onions and informal trade and cash out now.
You're talking about forgoing the mainstream for the resistance; but you also have the much more powerful option of trying to take the resistance mainstream.

I personally think that's not true. I have seen firsthand that Spain has just a strong a libertarian culture as the US does. Yes, the culture does have a different emphasis than the US (more anti-corporate, anti-money and more communitarian generally), but these people run businesses without licenses, self-organize to provide healthcare and education with the specific intent of avoiding state involvement, use every trick they can find to help people pay lower taxes, and do it all with ideological fervor. Calling them anything but libertarian would be an inverted no-true-scotsman fallacy. Italy and Greece have their fair share of similar movements as well.
However, your general point that anti-authoritarian movements are stronger in countries where "the system" works less well is very valid.

Not really. There is no 7 transactions per second limit; there is a 1 MB per block limit. Combining two transactions into one doesn't really save much space, all in all you would be gaining very little. The only reason to combine transactions is that if you can get several transactions together under 1kb you can save a few percent of a bitcent on fees, since fees are calculated rounding up to the nearest kilobyte per transaction.

So it's not so much Electrum vs Armory in terms of their "normal" use (as the two clients have exactly the same security properties in terms of wallets and password protection), but rather their usability for offline transactions. Okay. I'll accept that offline Armory is a superior client for doing such things. My main beef with Armory's usability only comes into play when the client has to connect to the internet and start using the blockchain. If Armory would release a version that connects to Electrum servers for networking instead of a local bitcoind (and uses the Electrum server for all blockchain queries), I would be happy and even recommend the client to average users. Now, though, having to have two running applications, 2GB of RAM (or however much it is now), and maintain a 6GB blockchain download just to send and receive transactions is a deal-breaker.

The problem is, the concept of assassination markets betrays a very poor understanding of public choice economics - ironically, the same branch of economics that ultimately backs up a large portion of criticism of government. The primary rule in public choice economics is this: concentrated interests win, diffuse interests lose. If there is a politician that implements regulation  which hurts millions of people by $50 to benefit one corporation by $1 million, no single individual has the incentive to donate to take them out - their own contribution will not significantly affect the final result. If, on the other hand, regulation  already exists but some politician wants to remove it, then the corporation would be very willing to spend anything up to $999999 on the kill, so they would very likely end up dead. So assassination markets would actually naturally tend towards the worst and most oligarchic possible policies imaginable, to a much greater extent than today.
