Blog outlines that the characteristics of ASICs initiates an incentivisation model for miners that is greater than GPUs. This model greatly rewards ASIC miners whilst propogating the security of the network. No justification of ASICs? or not written well enough? Both very different points.

We do export back to the grid, and have been doing so since March 2017 but we have actually hit our limit. Right now it is impossible for us to export any more back to the grid (infrastructure constraints). All the excess renewable energy that we have is being committed to the mining farm, completely off-grid.

I think you're right in regards to bitcoins 'role' in the market. The sooner a coin dethrones bitcoin, the sooner we will be able to fully appreciate the purpose of other projects (not many purposeful crypto projects btw). Also, we are seeing an increase in fiat + alternative cryptocurrency gateways into altcoins which alleviates the pressure/reliance on bitcoin.

Hi MDK,
I wrote the blog. I've been following the chart above (top 100 richest bitcoin addresses) for the past 3 months, and judging by the 'ins' and 'outs', it seems as if the majority of the top 100 (we're talking more than 80%+) have been increasing their holdings consistently whilst smaller wallets have been liquidating their positions. I'm not sure if you were expecting a spreadsheet or a specific article analyzing this data. I hope that answers part of your question.

I agree with what you're saying, hence why I left the article open to debate with no definitive theory. It's hard to be impartial about BTC's performance amidst a recession, because, I, like so many others, are so emotionally invested in the idea of Bitcoin being this 'safe-haven asset', but, putting that aside for a second. The inception of the next Bitcoin bull market coinciding with a recession could JUST be the perfect recipe that we've all been waiting for. Just.

I'm sorry good sir, is there anything else you would like me to abide by today? or is that it? Merry Xmas x

Okay. But in all seriousness, don't you want to know the laws that you have to abide by? Or you just planning on dodging your taxes through privacy coins and buying land in the Bahamas? If so, goodluck.
