What about the [mining]( on the main website? Just curious.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:13:11
No, I know how much I don't know about Bitcoin. That's why I came here in the first place.

Oh, god! Well, that settles it. No mining for me! XD
Anyways, it seems everyone here is telling me to just buy and sell—I will go with that then. Thanks!

I know what Bitcoin is and how it works. I just don't know what are the technicalities behind it. However, thanks for your sources! I will check them out.


Far enough, but what about this [link]( They offer long-term contracts for a reasonable price. I'm not trying to argue or say anything, I'm just curious.
Thanks for your time!

What part of "newbie" you don't understand? You know, I came here for a reason and some of you are not too friendly about it. What reason you may ask? Advice from people with experience.

There! Thank you! That is all I wanted to know!

Dude, chill! How many times I need to tell you that I'm a newbie? I'm still getting into this stuff and get the hang of things. You could've just told me that this not the official website.
Anyways, how about mining Bitcoin on my own? What is the cheapest possible way to do that?

But I apologized! I'm sorry, man!
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:47:49
Well if they mean that, then I'm sorry and I admit to my mistake. I appreciate all of the help you guys are sharing and I'm grateful for it!
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:21:48
It seems like that this will be the case. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:52:29
Gotcha, thanks for the heads up!
