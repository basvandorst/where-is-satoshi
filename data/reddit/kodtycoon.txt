thats because of what ever system they use. which as it states is apparently different to the system used by other institutions so while it may be an issue for SBI, it wouldnt be for other banks. and you do realize that it says that it replicated the number of transactions they normally do, between 2.5million accounts and it worked? they set up tests to replicate their own system, the transactions they do, and between the same amount of accounts they maintain, and it worked. so the 15 second thing obviously isnt an issue for them. read the last paragraph before the "Note:" paragraph. they even knocked off 5 out of 6 nodes and saw zero performance degrading.

private blockchains are not about value transfer, at least not in the sense that bitcoin is. they are about data management, record keeping, making sure an infrastructure witnesses zero down time (especially relevant in vital services whether that be hostpital systems, financial or emergency services and many others), huge reduction in associated costs of infrastructure and infrastructure maintenance. 
some less vital but still highly important aspects could be things like record keeping of department funding/transactions etc etc in large, multinational companies. there are numerous cases for private blockchains, just like there are numerous use cases for local area networks(private computer networks in organisations, colleges companies etc), though they service different but sometimes related use cases as wide area networks(internet).
they would also mean that needing to maintain back ups becomes a non issue if multiple nodes are running as each node would always be fully up to date. if the bitcoin can be maintained at 100% uptime since its birth there is no reason private chains cant replicate this track record. the transactions on the private chains could also be obfuscated or encrypted so that only the nodes of the chain, or a subset of the nodes of the chain can see some, all or selected transactions
the catch is that, the two go hand in hand. the internet would be drastically limited if there was no such thing as LAN's and vice versa. when the two are connected, the combined local and wide area networks are suddenly a lot more useful - if its not, why would this be the set up of pretty much every commercial and educational entity on the planet?
so while private blockchains will handle internal record keeping and data management, infrastructure cost reduction and increase in infrastructure reliability, public chains will handle the cross boarding, inter-organisational or similar trasactions. 
i dont think consumers will transact on the main blockchain, which ever that ends up being. it would be more like the likes of mastercard running a private blockchain that can handle thousands of transactions per second as their back bone infrastructure, and the private chain also supporting smart contracts that link private chains through a main public "real" chain. 
banks will also run private chains with links to other banks through the main chain totally eliminating all need for intermediaries that cause such huge delays and fees in international banking because if a banks private chain can initiate a trustless transaction to another bank via smart contract integration between public and private, transaction speeds from bank A to bank B is reduced to that of the conformation time of the main chain. 
in this scenario you would have say mastercard running a private chain, recording all their users transactions in a zero down time, cost effective and much more reliable environment with transactions between them and their bank partners(and between the banks) being initiated partly, or possibly mostly, by executing private chain smart contracts that initiate public chain transactions. 
crypto currencies wont disappear simply because of the proliferation of private chains, private chains will proliferate the use of public chains and multiply the number of use cases exponentially as more and more companies/indivuduals/organisations/governments join this cryptographic network. 
 disclosure: i am far from a visionary... its being done already and its already being put into action...

pay particular attention to when he talks about blocksize. maybe watch some of his other videos too if your new.
edit: to actually answer your question, when blocks get too big, it will mean less people can run nodes leading to further centralisation weakening the system. but further (and perhaps more serious) is that it will take longer for blocks to permeate the network as they get larger. this is a problem because if miner A mines a block and distributes it and miner B doesnt see this block before mining one itself, there are now two valid blocks  at height x, so one must be rolled back. the longer it takes for blocks to permiate the network, the more valid blocks can temporarily exist at the same time. one block needs to eventually 'win' while the others get rolled back. when a block is rolled back, the transactions in that block also get rolled back until they are confirmed again assuming they arent already in one of the other blocks. this is NOT a good thing by any means and would make the network far less reliable. thats just one of many issues that can arise, but one i think andreas doesnt actually touch on iirc.

I dont believe this is true. If the internet is anything to go by, which still hasnt reached full potential, its unlikely blockchain will do so. Perhaps its more accurate to say that blockchain will see a substantial percentage of global adoption. This is an area where no one could predict what 'full potential' will look like, so i dont see how its possible to predict when we will reach that point with any accuracy.

Agree for sure. That said, it still doesnt make it any easier to predict. We may get there faster due to the pace of everything but we still dont know how far we need to go. What i find most interesting is that we may eventually see a new  push to improve the internet itself just to keep up with the developments in crypto. With sufficient incentive, the internet could go through a new growth spurt if blockchain tech at any point reaches the limitation of the internet. Ie. Block propogation: improve code further or bandwidth? At some point the gains from code improvement may become so negligable that we are better off improving internet infrastructure. Right now that may sound outlandish, but with sufficient incentive it may not be such a crazy proposition. Googles search algorithm is a good example. Google spends shed tonnes of money and time to make miniscule improvements to the code because at such vast scale these small improvements matter a lot, even if they cost huge amounts. However as a side effect it has now become far more economical to invest in internet infrastructure as well.
  
 
This is one company. Probably of many are doing the same. I cannot wait to see what happens when blockchain reaches this point. I suspect blockchain tech will provide much greater incentive than any one individual may have to improve internet infrastructure.

Hello jeff.
If this is the case, how come bitcoin hasnt had any new features what so ever built into the protocol?
There are some very interesting features such as asset exchange, voting system, digital good store, multigateway, turing complete/automated transactions, autoDAC, subatomic/atomic cross-chain transactions, ebay like physical good store and the list goes on.
other coins have the ability to build entire social networks in a totally p2p decentralised manner on top of the blockchain with out the need of any third party control.
im not getting into a debate about what platform is best so i wont mention names but one platform is on the verge of becoming the first truly decentralised p2p cryptocoin exchange using an asset exchange. its undeniable that there is a vast amount of demand for such a thing.
so many features that have so many use cases and that are in demand but yet bitcoin does not change what so ever? 
if bitcoin can adopt the features of other coins, why have none of these in demand features not been developed?
turing complete is an great example. ethereum has gotten a huge amount of attention due to the new abilities it will bring to life but bitcoin does not even attempt or propose to integrate such features.
as i understand it, bitcoin requires a fork in order to integrate any new features, however there are numerous other platforms that do not require such action and can have powerful tools effectively bolted onto the protocol with out any changes to the core protocol. does this not give these other platforms a huge advantage?
bitcoin as it stands, can only function as a currency, in order to stay on top, it will need to adopt these new technologies and fast in order to keep a competitive edge in the long run.
if bitcoin can integrate new features into the protocol, why were these additional functions beyond currency not integrated years ago. the concepts of these functions have been around for a very long time and are only now being developed by new platforms while bitcoin seems to be "set in stone" as you say and its developers saying that bitcoin can adopt these features. should bitcoin, by rights, not have been the first to bring these functions to life if it is possible for bitcoin to integrate such functions?
why is there a 5 year delay in changing anything? the bitcoin developers are leaving the door wide open for a second generation to swoop in with all these functions built in seemlessly and overtake bitcoin. given it will take a long time to do so, but these new platforms will have gained serious ground by the time bitcoin integrates any of the functions mentioned and by then these new platforms will be a serious threat to bitcoins dominance.
i think it is time to start making changes to bitcoin if it is possible to integrate such functions because otherwise bitcoin will not be top dog for long. the longer it takes for bitcoin to integrate even one new feature beyond currency the more the idea that bitcoin cant change is "set in stone".
the idea that bitcoin is set in stone, has its roots in the fact that bitcoin, for the most part, has never changed. which is the developers own doing, if what you say is true of course. 
i and many others, await these changes eagerly and the longer we wait, the fewer people there will be left waiting.

use keepass to create and save your passphrase.. no one will crack it ever if you use full strength 150 chars... just before your save it input a random word into the phrase after chaaracter 3 or something so even if someone steals your usb they cant take anything.. save the database file on a usb and load the file from usb when opening it.. its a pain but for the moment its the safest way... new tech will come along to make it more user freindly.. or just pick 10 random words and string them together and stick your whole families year of birth into it one bday between each word... brain wallets also have massive massive advantages also though... things that apply to far more then simply storing your coins.. it will all come to light soon! things not possible with local wallet files...

Checm out 
It's a website that interfaces with the nxt client so you can access the asset exchange with out downloading any clients and never stores any passwords. Account login and transaction signing is done locally. 
It's not the official client but its virtually identical so it's a good way of having a peek with out downloads. Have a look around, test it if you like - il send you nxt if you want. You can also purchase nxt with btc through it if your not bothered using exchanges.
Bitcoin has serious competition on the way. It would be wise to start adapting to the fast changing crypto environment asap.

Paper on different attacks related to multibranching forging is published by Consensus Research 
TL/DR version and consequences: 
- multibranch forging gives measurable possibility to earn more fees. I guess Nxt should not ignore it in long-term as the profitable activity will be implemented by somebody sooner or later
- there's no long-range attack against a blockchain V. Buterin described, only short-range. The short-range attack doesn't allow double-spending but gives multibranching forger possibility to earn more fees in singlebranch environment by producing few blocks in a row. However producing few blocks in a row could be an issue too (e.g. evil forger may postpones orders submissions etc) but not critical at the moment.
- not explicitly stated in the paper but easily derived, a long delay between blocks not only annoying but also a security problem as it's the moment for short-range attack could happens
- we have formally defined nothing-at-stake attack(again, using Buterin's informal definition) and made initial simulations. We haven't included their results in paper as they are seems to be too raw, but I can reveal them here: N attack could happens only in short-range, e.g. for within 20 blocks for 10% stake, so with 30 confirmations we haven't observed the successful attack. Also please note the attack has pretty unpredictable nature for attacker, so he can hardly enforce it, even in theory(in practice it's even harder to get it done properly). The correlation with stake size is still the open question, but it's nearly impossible to attack a proof-of-stake currency with "1% stake even" as stated by Buterin
- the N simulation tool is published also   so feel free to make your own experiments
- had 2-hours long conversation with andruiman yesterday. Probably we have elegant(not Slasher  ;D) solution to make consensus algorithmically enforced(like proof-of-work has) but a lot of experiments needed

try it for yourself. 
the software is broken into 2 parts. NIS, and NCC. NIS(Nem Infrastructure sever) does all the heavy lifting, and NCC(Nem Community Client) handles all the user side of things. What this opens the doors for is quite remarkable. currently i am running NIS on a server, i have NCC running locally and i connect it to the NIS using the IP address of the server. this allows me to connect to the remote NIS and do transactions and "harvest"(also known as forging) with a cold storage account all while never sending my private key across the network. 
This also means i never, ever have to wait for the blockchain to download as once i start up NCC it instantly connects to my NIS and im ready to go. Its also 100% decentralized unlike electrum (the only client i can think of that works even a remotely similar way). with the likes of bitcoin, you have two choices: download the blockchain. or use a centralized service. every single cryptocurrency to date is the same, except Nem. 
the essence of splitting the software in such a way means that i can, if i please, connect to a known hacker/theif's NIS and do transactions and harvest using as big an account as i like with out a single fear that the coins ever be stolen - i know what your thinking: the malicious entity could feed you incorrect data right? for now, correct. but that is easily solvable. Hopefully in the future NCC will be able to connect to multiple NIS so that data can be cross referenced and checked against other NIS to ensure correct data is being fed to the user - multisig for data if you like. whats interesting, is this would allow for mobile apps to run using remote nis picked up in the same way you pick up free wifi signals today. only connecting to one would be a problem only because you could be fed incorrect data, but what if your mobile app/client connected to 3 at once and cross checked? you could walk down the street, pick up on a NIS and make transactions with out fear of theft. the ways in which just this one innovation alone can be used are staggering.
that is only one of the new innovations that nem brings. Proof of importance is a new consensus mechanism created by the nem devs that, if for instance zero transactions ever happened on the network, would work the same as PoS. but the big difference is that your "weight" changes based on how important you are to the network, so instead of your "weight" and hence how many blocks you can forge/harvest/mine being judge by "how much"(mining power/amount owned) you are judged by "how well"(you participate in the network) which as far as i know is a big first for crypto.
would merchants not be considered massively important? in the current system they are not recognised by the protocol for being so important but with nem, that is exactly what happens. a merchant who has done many transactions(in and out) to many other people that have done many transactions could have a weight higher than someone who has 10x more coins but rarely makes any transactions. the merchant is clearly more important to the network than the selfish hoarder and in nem they are recognised for that. hence "how well" is a gigantic improvement on "how much".
these are only a small sample of the innovations. there is much much more to come but im not sure how much i can say about unreleased features right now so il not continue.
the beta client has been out for months and months in order to test the crap out of the network(2.2m transactions were done in a few months) and currently we are just waiting on multisig to be released in the GUI and then we launch and i have no doubt in my mind everyone will know what nem is once we do.

theres a lot, but the most promising looking chart is this one.
the stripes down are periods of extreme stability. the red stripe, means the price declined during that period of stability, and the green, of course means the price rose. following each of these periods of extreme stability, is most of the time a massive move, most of the time, upwards. the only down trend that followed these periods, was one that came after a red stripe without any green stripe.
theres a load of other stuff too, but day after day its looking way more like today resembles the start of 2013, and in that year there was a 20x bublle, followed by a 50% correction, followed by another 10x bubble. a total of 100x increase in less than 12 months.
hopefully that explains the excitement that many users share at the moment. :)

specifically: "Before leaving this area, I wanted to touch quickly on blockchain.  Blockchain technology has been getting a lot of attention lately.  It is the technology behind bitcoin, the digital currency which many of you have undoubtedly heard of.  Blockchain is a database network where messages create a digital record of a transaction that cannot be changed once approved in the “chain.”  Anyone on the computer network can see the details of the transactions on a public ledger.  Separate and apart from its use with bitcoin, some have been recently advocating that blockchain technology could revolutionize other areas of finance.  It could be used to overhaul areas like securities clearing and settlements, payment processing by banks, and cumbersome loan transactions.[6]  It has the power potentially to increase quality and facilitate trust.
 While I am not advocating for the adoption or effectiveness of blockchain technology, it appears to offer potential.  One can imagine a world in which securities lending, repo, and margin financing are all traceable through blockchain’s transparent and open approach to tracking transactions.  That could revolutionize regulators’ approach to monitoring systemic risk in these areas, including the oversight of collateral reuse, to name just one potential use.
 However, creative uses of blockchain are still in their infancy, and a lot of questions will need to be answered, including on issues related to cybersecurity.  I do think regulators, academics, and market participants in the U.S. need to be constantly evaluating potentially disruptive ideas like blockchain.  Can it be used to enhance the quality of our markets and investor protection?  Or, is there a way it could be used to monopolize markets or undermine competition?  How should this technology be best deployed?  Should it be run via a public-private partnership, somewhat like the Internet?  **If the market begins to move toward blockchain technology, regulators need to be in a position to lead, harnessing its benefits and responding quickly to potential weaknesses**
 **The Commission and its fellow regulatory agencies have a unique opportunity right now to be forward thinking in regards to some of these new innovations and ensure they develop thoughtfully, with investor protection as a guiding principle.  If investors have trust in the integrity and quality of these new services and products, everything else will follow, and the potential benefits can be harnessed, for both investors and financial services providers.**"

its when people bet that the market will go down. in short, they borrow btc from lenders and pay interest in the loan. they then sell the btc in the hope the price will go down. if it does, they buy back cheaper, repay the btc and keep the profit. if it goes against them, they get margin called, which is where the exchange automatically closes their trade by buying back the btc to repay the lender. this is most always done in conjunction with leverage: they borrow multiple times what they actually have as collateral, which lowers their "margin": how far the market can go against them before they get their trade closed for them.
 its highly profitable if you know what your doing but insanely risky. you can lose everything if your not careful and its happened many times before, where someone might place a massive bet and the market go against them, and in some cases people have lost millions in one bad trade. it happened only recently where someone had a 20k+ btc short position, just prior to the massive up tick. they got margin called and lost the entire 20k+ btc. the largest iv seen was something like 45k btc lost in one trade. stay clear away from it unless you know EXACTLY what your doing and have money to burn.

jesus no im not. let me rephrase again.. at what point would a company normally go public? how much acquired market share/value is considered a good cash out point for companies? the same investing methodology can be applied to bitcoin even if its not a company. ie. "ill cash out once btc has x% marketshare of remittance. but bitcoin doesnt have just one use case, it doesnt have just one category of users. it has many. so "ill cash out x amount when bitcoin has been adopted by x% of global population, another x% when it reaches Y% adoption by global population" etc etc. see my point? just because its not a company and this subreddit has an acute allergy to any association with a company it doesnt mean it can be invested in in the same fashion or using the same methodology as a companies stocks.

I'm not thinking of bitcoin as a company. Im asking specifically about market share/valuation if it were to hypothetically go public. In other words, at what point in bitcoins market share acquisition would institutional investors/vcs "cash out" if we were to call the last few years the equivalent to series a/series b investment.

traditional asset classes have gone up for the most part for an entire generation.. if bitcoin acts as a safe haven asset, which it has sort of proven to do on a few occasions, and this trend of continuous growth in traditional asset classes reverses, it very well might go up for (what feels like) forever.

the question is, how much in assets does the bank hold, how fast must they sell them to cover their asses, and how will the sell off affect other institutions, and also, will other holders of the assets the bank has, try to front run the selling or panic sell on hearing the news? this is how dominoes fall.

I can't say say for certain, but mijin is certainly the closest to commercialization than any iv read up on. While most others have done very basic tests, these guys are about to start charging for the service and have been tested by a bank which succeeded in managing the banks accounts in a real world scenario. So it's looking good. They'll certainly beat the rest to the punch. They were also mentioned A LOT in a recent japanese government report on blockchain tech.

20 years before the internet had a native currency, the guys that built the internet added a 402 payment required error code purely because they knew it might be needed once one is developed. Its not inconceivable that satoshi, brilliant as he is/was, had the foresight to see that many more blockchains would come into existance.
Nevertheless, i could just be mistaking it for something some random person said back in 2013 or something in the height of the bitcoin maximalist days, or maybe someone else said he said it and thats where i got the idea that he said it. I could be wrong and he might not have said it.

A store of value is a store relative to anything else of value. Not in relation to one particular other thing. if banks and fiat didnt exist, bitcoin could still be a store of value against other crypto currencies, art work, sports cars, houses etc. as can any of these items be that for bitcoin. Which is also precisely why:


is completely incorrect.


Even if the basis for this statement was correct, the point your trying to make would also apply perfectly to bitcoin as well.


This as well as everything that follows is just completely unrelated to anything i said....
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:02:17
Not to dismiss what satoshi did or anything, but it's severely lacking in a lot of ways, yes. So much so that it may only ever act as a form of value store, while other utility packed chains dominate every other part of the industry which will in turn eventually lead it/them to being a more viable store of value. 
edit: queue the haters and down votes lol

@_date: 2016-05-01 10:18:16
well considering the government currently in power has become anti-US, it could well just be another coup. that said, things are in such disarray there, it could just be genuine revolt. tbh, its turkey im getting seriously concerned about now. with their bombing of kurdish positions in iraq and on turkish soil, things could escalate quickly. turkey being a member of nato, could drag the US and other nations into war. its literally written into the nato rule book that if one country is "attacked", all other nato members are also considered to have been attacked, justifying an all out invasion of what ever country they can provoke into some kind of attack or via false flags. how economies are performing will be the least of the worlds worries if tensions in the middle east keep rising.

2.0 blockchain technology IS a real thing..  you have the likes of bitcoin, litecoin and all their thousands of forks that can literally do nothing except send and receive transactions.. the nokia brick phones of the crypto world if you like..
then you have 2.0 cryptos which can do far far more.. such as nem, nxt and such.. these cryptos can do magnitudes more than just send and receive.. they could be considered the smart phones of the crypto world. with so much more functionality and the simplicity of use of these features, ie. not having to swap between other tokens(mastercoin, counterparty et al) and/or features not being cross-compatible among all clients(copay and other 3rd party products built for bitcoin) it puts them into a league of their own, hence crypto 2.0.
the saying "currency is just the first application of blockchain technology" is true.. but it doesnt apply to 1.0.. or at least if it does, its usually done in a bulky, non-elegant way through third part client based implementations which are not cross compatible and make usability a nightmare. the difference is, only 2.0 blockchain technology can support all the other functions other than currency in the native protocol(blockchain based features(nxt's AE) apposed to client based(copay's multisig).
so the notion of 2.0 is a very very real thing.. with massive implications for 1.0 protocols in the long run, ie. making them redundant technology.
i know all of the 2.0 cryptos and their various pros/cons, i just wanted to see what sort of information would be given to a noob who asks, and the result was quite reveling when compared to responses from this time last year.

"currency is only the first application of blockchain technology" - Bitcoin proponents around the world
2.0 is what people have been yapping on about for years and now it has come around, but people dont like it cos it isnt on the bitcoin blockchain resulting in articles like this..

I got a beer in there once that cost me 45 czk (~90c) and paid near 3 euro for transaction fee during peak spam season. Or something to that effect. I only got one...

i pass this regularly :D there is also over 100 places that apparently accept bitcoin, some of which only accept bitcoin.

compare the video posted above to this one: 
that is the most user friendly example of a bitcoin multisig wallet i could find. Notice the massive difference. that is the difference between client based(which as far as i can tell from the copay video is centralised) and blockchain based(which is decentralised). 
notice also, that a "secret" must be given to the co-signers so they can add themselves to the multisig address rather than making them co-signers via a blockchain transaction simply by selecting addresses in your contacts and sending a particular type of transaction to them to make them a co-signer. this means the same wallet must be used(Copay) by all co-signers. if one of those guys preferred say, electrum, he could not use his preferred client AND be a co-signer on a copay multisig account. this is bad because not only now will there be centralisation of mining, but now, centralization and monopolization of clients which would stifle competition and ultimately innovation among clients once one client has the monopoly(visa?).
blockchain based multisig is more secure, more decentralised, discourages monopolies, its faster, more user friendly and compatible across all variations of third party clients and making someone a co-signatory can be seen on the blockchain which cant be done when utilizing client side multisig because co-signers are made co-signers, and are requested to sign transactions, off chain.
hope that makes it a little clearer. :)

dump her and get her back when shes lower. the lower she is the more she will appreciate.

Because they are too busy buying coins that do NOT resemble Bitcoin

far from a random shit coin.
just released the first ever blockchain based fully decentralised multisig implementation. State of the art harveting(forging) technology which allows users to connect to a remote instance of the software and harvest using a cold storage account with out ever sending a private key or any sensitive data over the network, even the operator of the instance (of NIS) could be a known thief and the account you harvest on it with can not be compromised. combine this with multisig and you can lock down your coins in a cold storage multisig account and use that account to harvest on a thiefs NIS and your coins will be safe all while using them to harvest. and in the same way you can harvest safely on a thief's nis, you can also do transactions safely.
and that isnt even the half of it. Proof of importance means that supporters of the network are rewarded based on "how well" rather than "how much". by this i mean that instead of the amount of blocks you can mine or harvest being based on "how much" money you have in the system(pos) or "how much" mining power you have, the amount of blocks you have harvest(forge) depends on "how well" you participate in the network. a lack of participation(hoarding) results in reduced "weight" but if you transact with many others in the network your "weight" is increased. it largely depends on who you transact with too, or more so, how important they are in the network, much like a web of trust.
there are a whole host of other innovations that have either been built or are in development also.
