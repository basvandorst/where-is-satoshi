Thank you! ��

Thank you, I have contacted both my bank (all clear there, and of course no attempt at a transfer was ever even made, as suspected) and Action Fraud UK. It's a long shot but would be nice to at least help keep this from happening to others

Okay sorry for mincing words, what I mean is this anoynymous email address gave me a wallet to send to that was supposedly an escrow wallet that once both parties have deposited their respected funds they will be released. This is the wallet address they gave me: 16ukVRnwboFNM9TUTLe3N2zjA4J6aEtoj4
Is this enough info for you??? Sorry if I wasn't in the most eloquent state of mind considering I've been robbed of nearly £600 and I posted this pretty much upon finding out.
Honestly this is like a whole other world to me and I'm struggling to fathom all this so I really am sorry if I'm missing something obvious or not explaining things well enough.


I guess the takeaway is quite simply do not trust people who DM you on Reddit as nice and well-meaning as they may seem. Had this happened on any other platform I don't think I would have been nearly as trusting — Reddit in particular is a platform I  trusted as I've had multiple pleasant experiences with people in real life over the years (meeting up with people, etc). I got scammed because I came to Reddit looking for help on an issue and someone private messaged me "trying to help me" and I was more inclined to trust fellow Redditors. Don't trust anonymous email addresses. It sounds obvious but I found myself in a situation where I was desperate to not lose anymore value in my BTC and I just wanted to change it into currency that I actually use in my daily life in my country.

How's this???
Not really sure what else you want to see for proof but ask and I'll do my best. I'd say you're being weirdly skeptical but this whole thing has taught me not to trust anyone so I can't say I blame you lol
ETA: Also that's not email that's reddit....
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:33:37


















I guess my point in saying that was more that I wasn't intentionally trying to do things under the radar; I have nothing to hide and I tried the above board options first. The scammer even mentioned tax stuff but I figured it's coming into my bank account anyway, I'm already self-employed and have to declare my earnings so I can just keep doing that. I'm not trying to maximise earnings or minimise taxes, or invest or anything, all I want is to find a reliable way to convert the BTC I'm paid into currency I use in my day-to-day life.

What would the hoax be? I was trying to find a 
wallet that would let me withdraw in bitcoin, someone messaged me on here giving me the info for an exchange they supposedly used that creates an escrow wallet for you. I'm not sure what information you think is missing but I can elaborate if you have any specific questions...?
ETA; withdraw in GBP sorry
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:20:07
In hindsight I would have obviously at least tried a test amount first but I was getting nervous as the exchange rate was only getting worse so I was losing £££ as it was sitting there so I was kind of desperate to figure out how to change it ��
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:22:15
I will do, thanks. I've already accepted I'm not seeing that money again but I'd like to help others and try and prevent this kind of thing from happening. Thats why I posted here but I was understandably upset at losing hundreds of ££ so I may have been a bit convoluted, but this is the kind of advice I was looking for. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:58:35
I'll PM you if that's okay as it's on my main account
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:57:58
Yeah, I've already gotten that far luckily but thanks for confirming my suspicions as I am clearly prime scam material!
@_date: 2019-08-23 21:08:48
That's okay, I'm glad I could show it was legitimate because I also don't want this to happen to anyone else and while I'm shocked I fell for it I do think the tactics were very persuasive - I honestly didn't smell anything fishy at all until the weird flirting part and even then I just tjlught "OK that's weird but whatever..." and the penny didn't drop until today when I got the last email from them saying my bank had rejected the transfer.
I wish I had seen a warning somewhere on a subreddit to specifically NOT trust DMs. From my position I saw the DM as actually *more* trustworthy - in the past DMs I've gotten on "asking for advice" type posts have usually been to make you privy to a secret kind of thing and that's exactly how she/he/it framed it - that I was getting crap advice in the comments, she'd been through the same and wanted to help me out.
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:21:33
Yeah I'm hoping I can at least help someone else as when I searched for scam I didn't find anything. Maybe it could be put in a sidebar or something?
And yeah they sounded *super* normal. I don't think I'm the world's most gullible person but I'm also not usually this much of an idiot... I've always had good experiences with being helped by people on reddit before so I guess I was more trusting.
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:05:06
At the risk of asking you for advice and subsequently trusted you, how would you recommend I receive BTC and turn it into GBP?
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:11:56
Yes unfortunately. I have the messages with her on reddit as well but the account has been deleted. The account name was katesayshey.
If mods here or maybe on the beginner subreddit want I can create a gallery of the messages so people can be warned of what to look out for and hopefully not fall for the same thing I did
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:34:54
I'm really not sure what exactly you're looking for... If I sent it to an anonymous email there wouldn't be a paper trail, would there? That's kind of exactly how the scam is meant to work, no?
I honestly can't tell if you're pulling my leg or if I'm actually missing something here. As I said I know nothing about cryptocurrency
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:31:50
[UKBTCVendor which is the "service" she referred me to. I didn't check how old the account was (another lesson learned for next time)
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:53:21
I was paid and was simply looking for a way to withdraw to my bank in GBP and was struggling to find wallet recommendations (I was paid into Exodus but they don't convert to GBP which was all I wanted). I have no interest in trading or anything like that and never wanted to get into BTC to begin with but it was one of the only ways to get paid ��
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:05:46
It was an email that's since been deactivated. UKBTCVendor
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:14:15
They don't do UK/GBP, that's actually the first place I looked but it didn't seem viable. Now I'm finding out people either convert to Euro and then Coinbase or I'll just have to use epayments
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:23:12
Thanks for the reality check. :) As stated I am completely out of my depth with this stuff so it's honestly a bit hard to tell. I don't want to step on any toes
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:16:24
I tried this first and something wasn't viable. Thats how I got in this mess in the first place because the most recommended wallets weren't viable. I think they don't do GBP?
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:57:54
Yeah I can see there's a huge market potential there, I was trying to do everything above board but all the most popular options weren't viable for several reasons. I came on here for help and I've always had good experiences with reddit before so I was more trusting :(
ETA: I figured it was going to be coming into my bank account anyway and I'm already self employed so I have to declare and pay all income. This wasn't me trying to do anything under the table, I was just looking to get paid easily �� I'm really not concerned about privacy
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:38:06
Yes I did and it was a fake wallet and exchange... I am mostly trying to figure out how I can help other people from this happening to them. I will DM you screenshots
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:15:42
I am a woman FWIW so having a supposed mum come onto me was weird ("she" was complimenting me on pictures I'd posted on my main account). I really don't appreciate you jumping to conclusions on that front because even if this whole thing hadn't been a scam I would have rather the flirting never happened.
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:10:23
Lol no shit, and no the honeypotting came after, not before I said yes and if I'm honest it made me super uncomfortable and is when I should have known something was up although it would have been too late by then anyway. I was in no way swayed by that so don't put words in my mouth please
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:38:42
Does it matter? :(
