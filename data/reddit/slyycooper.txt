thank you for your in depth answer, I think I might just use the paper wallet as you say. so from what I gather this would basically consist of taking my private key off of coinbase, then writing down the private key, then deleting said file from my pc? 
also as a side question, what antivirus/malware do you use since I'd like to get some before getting into this so I can scan for keylog malware etc. as you said. preferably a free one would be nice although I understand if it's lower quality.

I heard that bitcoin ownership is basically only determined by knowing the code for a particular bitcoin, since I can only buy part of a bitcoin how would this work? It seems like if I only knew the coin code it could be mistaken for me owning the entire coin so how does it get around this? 
Also, how do I basically just download the 'file' for the bitcoin onto my pc and it's thus off my coinbase wallet or are there extra steps, also is it unwise to just keep it on my pc?

this is part of my pause I'd say, since it isn't centrally regulated I feel like it's really easy to get scammed, their servers to get hacked without compensation etc., not to mention I wouldn't like their servers to save my bank information since I obviously need to give them said information to make the initial purchase. 


any extra steps to this I should look for or just pretty standard? 
ty either way

ok ty, in terms of hardware wallet do you just mean my pc or is there a better method? also if I just download my bitcoin off coinbase, like is this getting it off their database or is there something more official to take it out of my coinbase wallet?
