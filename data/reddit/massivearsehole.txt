This is a good idea. Newcomers look at the btc price and think there's no way they can own it, it's way too high. 
It would need lightning network to operate very soon for it to be feasible though.

This is quality,

Yeah they'll call it a bubble and a crash and try and say told you so, you're all wankers. Then it'll go back to increasing at a normal rate and they'll be the wankers

Yep I'm done with it. Greedy bastards. This is supposed to be decentralised tech, they are just becoming like any other big organisation. Keep themselves rich and fuck everyone else. If bcash succeeds then the power and control will lie in the hands of a few people.

I haven't a clue what the fuck anybody is talking about in this thread. I'm pretty sure the only guaranteed way to make money is to work your bollocks off.
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:08:29
Probably the worst attempt in history ffs
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:44:37
So the original btc chain will be limited to 21 million? What about the others? What is their limit?

Seems like he has a serious chip on his shoulder with the United States and wants to become super wealthy/powerful to be in a position to disrupt the system.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:12:44
Yeah proper assholes that could ruin the whole thing
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:43:01
Sound so dodgy. Greedy people at the top, these assholes have made more money than they could possibly ever need why don't they just fuck off.

Bitcoin won't survive unless they can reduce electricity usage. It can't continue using more electricity than some countries do. Eth has got this sorted with proof of stake.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:02:00
Wouldn't it also leave newcomers not knowing which bitcoin to use and cause lots of confusion. Forks will damage bitcoin, hopefully only one will survive and become dominant. I can't see retailers taking payment in all bitcoin forks. There needs to be one.

$196,165.80 and a packet of haribo
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:49:45
Yeah thought so, just wondering what implications this will have on future price of bitcoin if endless coins are produced and on different chains.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:39:14
This is some low grade shit and proof he's a dodgy bloke
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:42:09
Bitcoin isn't being used for anything other than to make money at the moment. It's not actually being used for anything else. It's not a viable currency at the moment so mainstream adoption won't happen till it sorts  transaction times and fees out.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:45:56
I just hope this doesn't clog the network and it becomes so fecking useless and slow, it's already bad enough. Greed could be its downfall.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:53:02
I know which I'll be sticking with then.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:57:11
Well the original bitcoin value would be hugely diluted wouldn't it?
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:12:17
She's a twat anyway
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:29:32
ETFs can do one
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:53:46
That's not an argument
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:26:34
Before $10000 it will be heavily regulated or banned in some developed nations. This will curtail such volatility/growth
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:27:22
This is amazing! Power shift to the common man, well done.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:59:52
The current one
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:32:36
That's because it's the biggest issue bitcoin faces
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:25:22
Where I live you can't have vast amounts of money leaving government control without them taking their cut. There would be chaos, the healthcare is public funded and already fucked, public services would fail, welfare system would be fucked it will never happen here unless there is some form of taxation.
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:53:58
Neither is that
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:18:45
If exchanges are banned mainstream adoption will struggle
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:13:46
So currently 150 billion or so has gone missing from the world economy. That number is only going to increase, the governments won't allow that to continue without knowing where it is and how much you are making. Bitcoin would become an underground currency and never reach mainstream adoption because it would be made illegal to use. The common man would be too afraid to use, therefore another currency would prevail. In other words some sacrifices will have to be made for mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:04:48
The regulators are still far more powerful than cryptocurrencies though. Crypto is still a small fish in a big pond. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:07:24
What happens if they ban exchanges and you can't convert to fiat? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:05:06
How are those other countries going to trade bitcoin with nations that ban it and don't recognise it? I expect more open blockchain currencies will prevail that are used by banks, nations and the general public where taxation can happen. It's impossible to shield your money from the government and expect normal life to continue.
