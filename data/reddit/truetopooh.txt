I would assume no pending activity covers getting 6 confirms on outgoing coins or Bank Deposits  all processed. 
That is weird, sorry your having issues.

In the US, I would buy an Amazon, Target, or BestBuy card for example and use it online to buy the PSN card.
I know it is not direct Bitcoin to PSN, it is just an option to consider if you don't find a direct one in Canada.
I don't know what stores you have in Canada that can be bought off Gyft is the only reason I can't tell you the exact one to use.

You might be able to use Gyft to buy a gift card to a store and get it.
Well, you can for sure in the US no problem (other than fees) but not sure about Gyft and stores in Canada.

Gamers club makes it hands down the best place to buy disc games. 20% off and $10 back in rewards for preorders. Hard to top that anywhere.

If it crashed again isn't that a better  time to get a cheaper one? Or am I confused.

I haven't bought a lottery ticket since my first Bitcoin purchase. I would far rather buy $5-10 of Bitcoin then toss it away on a lottery ticket.
And I still get the thrill of gambling just watching the price. :)

The Starbucks app does the same thing. It is just a digital gift card with the same number every time. 
Since coinforcoffee.com went down I have been using Gyft to buy cards to refill the Starbucks app card.

When you click withdraw you can choose your linked CC or Bank Account.
The help section even mentions it under withdrawals.
" Withdrawing funds from your Circle account is simple and secure. All you need is a linked bank account or credit/debit card for a destination for your money"

My view is the less places with my CC info the better. We hear daily about companies hacked and CC info stolen.
Granted that is not a huge factor since netflix already has my CC info, but for new places I shop at I much prefer bitcoin over handing my CC info over.

They promised if you got an invite. It seems invites are over and it is now open. So no more $10. Those who got invites did get the $10. Really seems the luck of the draw who got invites, the amount of requests had to be massive.

I know it is still a third party app, however I have introduced a few friends with coinforcoffee.com (new site is  )
20% off starbucks was enough to get a couple of them using it. 
How fast and easy it works is pretty amazing. Even more so than Gyft at times.

I was wondering about that too. Seeing as when you balance transfer it is seen as a payment it is possible this would work the same way. 
I will know in a couple days. Tested it today. The only Bitcoin I have ever sold. Just a small amount to test though.

I have spent more at Starbucks in the past month after finding that site than in the entire year before.
Thank goodness for that 20% discount.

Unless I am totally losing it, there is no option to pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:54:04
It shows as a money transfer. You can pay down the balance but not make your monthly payment with it. So if you pay it to 0 you are fine but if you still have any balance you need to pay the minimum payment the old school way.

I have given a few people $5 and $10 amounts. I plan to do a  few more people once coinforcoffe.com is back up. 
When it is up it is a great example of how useful Bitcoin can be.

Check out Google wallet and the Google card. I know it is still carrying a card but it takes you down to one card that can access all your other cards. And if you lose it you only have one card to cancel and replace.
It also does rewards cards in the wallet. I no longer carry all my different reward cards, they are all In my phone.  
Google wallet really slimmed down my wallet. Now it is just ID, medical card, and Google wallet card.

Sounds like possibly your issue there.  Maybe it is different in Chile but especially when mail is coming from another country it would seem important.
The wrong postal code in the US would get your stuff sent back most of the time too.
This really sounds like an address issue and nothing directly to do with Bitcoin. You would have had the same problem paying with a CC.
I hope you get it fixed though. Not getting a package you are waiting on is one of the layers of hell.
@_date: 2014-09-19 03:48:50
Thank you, placed my first order today, and if it is as good as it looks it will not be my last =)
Edit: Checking out somewhere with Bitcoin still amazes me. So quick and easy with no fear of a website or store getting hacked and using my CC info.

I still spend but I buy them back right away and a bit extra each time.
As a post on here the other day pointed out. Every time I spend Bitcoin now my savings grows. I have now put more in savings aka Bitcoin that I hold than I ever had before saved via any other means.

Not quite that low of a price $59 vs $46, but one method you could use to get it. Buy it from Amazon via gyft.com 
Gyft delivery is almost instant, so just buy an Amazon card on Gyft then use that on Amazon. You could be downloading in 10 minutes.

I upgraded to a new phone and did not realize this. I almost lost several hundred $$ with Coinbase  thankfully I was able to send the BTC to another wallet before I got locked out by the 30 day timer. (Was locked out the next day)
Really sucked and Coinbase just told me to contact google.
I was not smart enough back then to take your advice about backing up those codes. I just figured they would be tied to my google account like everything else Google.

The blockchain.info app does that quite often

$150 to legally partake and grow. That is just mind boggling living in a state like Texas. 
And 15% off for Bitcoin. Dam I live in the wrong state.
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:20:26
Aye, in case I was not clear in my wording, that was what the last section of my comment stated.
Most likely it is that way, still humorous though.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:22:07
Well the 2.9% or some such shown on circle.
I just now paid $240 on a card and it came out to around $233 that actually went to the card after fees.
Now to see how long it takes to credit.
Less than one hour from cold storage to payment made from Circle. My guess is three days to credit on CC.
Bitcoin is so much better than the old system.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:15:03
If sell and payout to a Credit card, it shows up as a credit on the card. But it does not show up as a payment. So unless you pay off your full balance you will still need to pay the minimum payment the normal way.
That is how it worked the one time I tried it.
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:00:09
Sounds like smart income to me. 
People browsing a Bitcoin site are unlikely to bite. It is basically free money for the site. (Or do they only get paid for clicks?)
It is kinda hiliarious that banks pay Bitcoin sites to advertise the banks. 
I know most of it is set up through an ad company and the banks and Bitcoin sites do not deal directly for the ads, but there is some definite humor there.

Just curious, but where does the 2.1 come from? What makes that real money over 2.0?
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:47:14
Gyft.com sells gift cards for Bitcoin from lots of popular stores. You can use a CC but you get more points back from Bitcoin so 1% additional.
My favorite and most used method of bitcoin lately is
20% off Starbucks is no joke if you are a fan.
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:27:43
I use this every time we got to Starbucks. 20% off is nice and makes me feel  less crazy spending money there.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:20:54
This works but unless you pay off in full you still have to pay minimum payment the normal way. It shows as a credit on CC statement and not a payment.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:58:01
Ha-ha gyft will take as much as you want to give it. Amazon, Best Buy, and lots of big name stores through it.
And as someone else replied newegg.com will take all you want to spend too. :)
Bigger than that and I don't know. I have a hard time spending large amounts. I keep thinking how much more it will be worth later, so keep a small spending pool.
@_date: 2015-07-28 17:51:56
Interesting slide there.
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:37:23
I use it all the time. 20% off is the only reason I go. Works seamlessly in store just like a gift card on gyft or the Starbucks app.
The only catch is you don't get a pin to transfer balance to Starbuck app, but for 20% off I can live with that.
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:22:29
Starbucks accepts Starbucks gift cards not Bitcoin, and THEY do not sell cards for Bitcoin. Fold and Gyft accept bitcoin and give you a Starbucks (and other types) gift card.
Starbucks has no clue you are spending Bitcoin when you go in the store. It is just a gift card. The real hero here is

We verify customer service, timing, cleanliness, and such.

I contract for around 40 different companies. All of them are hired by businesses so I never work directly for the companies I shop. Mystery shoppers are independent contractors and pick and choose what jobs we do.
The survey itself was a banking survey for one of the companies I work for. While I am not comfortable naming the company the survey is for directly, I can link you to a few reputable companies I have done work for.
I found most companies I work for through

I use it often, but lately can only get reload to show for $5. If I am buying for more than one person it is easier just to use gyft instead. I much prefer your process and prices but the $5 limit lately really blows.
Currently it is not even offering any price to reload and I can not use it if I wanted too.
Other than those issues I love it. 20% off is awesome.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:05:49
Thank you so much, this will be coming right back at you via your app soon =)
As to the question. 
Personally I would be fine with $10.00 and up, 
The only time I ever by $5.00 is when the others are not there.
I always spend a bit more then $5 even when alone, So $10 is a good base to start at. (especially when you factor in it is only $8 worth of Bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-03-20 03:02:30

 This was standard at BlockBuster too, for late fees, unreturned movies, etc. Card expired no problem just add two years and charge. It worked most of the time.
