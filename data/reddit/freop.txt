Great point.  This is also how miners are going to be incented to continue processing after the last bitcoin are issued.  It's there and like it is for a reason.

Keep in mind that the ultra wealthy are incented to keep the price as low as possible for as long as possible.  Acquire as much as you can before switching opinions and then start pimping the the heck out of.

I dunno why ya'll getting excited about this.  He's likely never seeing any BTC and is converting directly to USD.

Detractors could have different motivations...
Some people want to protect the status quo because they're comfortable with it.
Some people actively sell a message even if they don't believe it.
Some people are afraid of things they don't understand so they completely dismiss it.
Some people are brilliant in only a specific area, but cannot translate that into different topics.
Some people like to play devil's advocate.
Some people are greedy and do not want others to partake.

I suppose this is possible, but how do you then reconcile the fact that the hashing power of the network is over 2,400,000 petaflops now?

It really depends how you're paying with Venmo.  If you're using a credit card, like I imagine most people are, you are being charged a fee.  
Also, Bitcoin can be a way of transferring property.  Show a (theoretical at this point) person Bitcoin versus Escrow for a deed and the value of Bitcoin becomes a lot more clear.
