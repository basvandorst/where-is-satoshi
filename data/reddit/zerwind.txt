if the banks and governments are worried about bitcoin or any digital currency they would simply make the concept illegal. I think the banks and governments see bitcoin as not being a big threat.

I'm curious about something. What mechanisms are in place if a government and/or bank system find they can't manipulate bitcoin and ban/block it. Can bitcoin still hold value if that happens. Also can bitcoin be used if the internet is unavailable?  I don't hate bitcoin just uneasy about the fact that if I loose internet access (price goes up to high or the bitcoin gets blocked) I would loose money.

This is my opinion and not something solid that can happen.
Can a central bank control / manipulate the value to gain profit? 
 If the answer is yes then bitcoin will last. If the answer is no than the protocol may not be allowed threw the countries that banks have influence over governments.
This would be my reason for not jumping on board. I believe in this world all bitcoin benefits is a threat to the precent money grab system. 
 
Again it's my opinion from what I read so far about both systems.

Not allowed would mean bank lobbiest  getting politicians to ban and  blocking the protocol. 
  We the people don't own or control the internet, We would have to make an alternative network for that.  I don't believe the present corporate internet will be as free-flowing in the near future as it is now.  
 this is my opinion that if bitcoin takes money out of the pockets id the rich and powerful they will stop it, I think many of these people don't understand bitcoin yet.   I'm not against bitcoin i just don't believe the internet will be the same topology 5 to 10 years from now.
