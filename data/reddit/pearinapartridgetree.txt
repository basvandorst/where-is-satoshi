Because 2500 eur of bitcoin transactions per month means an average of 25 eur per month per participating business, which is SO not worth the effort.
@_date: 2016-11-29 23:12:29
Yep, it's a lie like most bitcoin ads.
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:06:04


This is 110% pure delusion, just saying.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:37:02
None of the examples you posted were from the 1980s, which kind of was the point. And even if all your claims were true, they would still mean *absolutely nothing* wrt bitcoin being able to scale.
You're just lying about things that you think will benefit you financially or ideologically. it's understandable.
@_date: 2016-11-29 23:02:55
Redefining words, are you?
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:30:25


Heh, the opposite of bitcoin :D
But seriously, none of those articles claim that ethernet cannot scale, and none of them are from the 1980s. And then there are your claims about email and internet. Let's just agree that you were bending the truth, like bitcoiners are wont to do.
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:17:42
Strange, for some reason you forgot to mention those few smart/lucky people who managed to cash out at $1100.

Now you're really grasping at straws. Bitcoin is not the internet, it's a silly pyramid scheme.
Also nobody ever made those claims because all of those technologies do scale pretty nicely. Unlike Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-06 11:26:46
"Having had no issues with transactions up to now" is not what scaling means. Also, in reality bitcoin has constantly issues with transactions being silently dropped, not confirming in days, or when that one Russian guy decides to run another "stress test" on his home computer and paralyzes the network. Claiming otherwise is a plain lie.

Actually it's a good and factual one, you just don't like the conclusions.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:22:37
I bet he is *really* upset now. Yes. Devastated.
@_date: 2016-12-04 22:46:57
Have you considered it? You'd fit right in.
@_date: 2016-11-25 21:16:52
It's a heroic effort!

This is how libertarians really think.

He *is* doing something productive and worthwhile. He's protecting people against being scammed, or losing their money due to the incompetence of the ETF managers.

Here:  
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:59:28
Why don't you post a few properly sourced quotes from experts claiming that ethernet, email, or internet can never scale? You know, to demonstrate that you did not just make all that up.
I'm here to provide newbies with fair and fact-based introductions to bitcoin to counteract the propaganda and lies spread by bitcoiners.
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:31:20


We already did. We're using GSM because it superseded its predecessors like NMT and AMPS.
@_date: 2016-11-25 21:27:17
Once enough people decide to realize these theoretical gains and cash out, you'll find out how pyramid schemes and speculative bubbles end.
@_date: 2016-09-30 10:09:52
Wow, just like what happened with MtGox and Bitfinex! Sounds ominous!

How dare he suggest that our noble religion is as bad as their evil cult?
@_date: 2016-10-07 09:44:48


By buying internet tokens from the people above you in the pyramid? I had no idea the cypherpunk movement was a MLM scheme.

Surely you must agree there are epistemological statuses other than true and false, including "undecided"?
@_date: 2016-10-07 10:00:48
That Attorney General Paxful sounds like a statist.

Oh no, not *the people who read the white paper*!
@_date: 2016-10-18 17:08:55
You'd be stupid to trust any of them blindly, but that's beside the point. The fakes could have been inserted before the emails were given to wikileaks.
@_date: 2016-10-14 20:36:39
Why should you care what Satoshi said unless you consider him.... *an authority?*
@_date: 2016-10-18 09:43:36
Just a quick question, what makes you think all of those emails are real (as in actually written by her)?
@_date: 2016-10-09 12:02:29
Lol, you're an awful person
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:00:04


Tell me more about this ROI that Bitcoin offers, and especially where the money is coming from!
@_date: 2016-10-18 14:09:19
You misunderstood the question I think. I'm not asking why some of the emails might be real, I'm asking why you assume *all* of them, e.g. the warmongering ones, should be real. It'd be easy for the leaker to insert fake emails among the real ones.

What's the CEO's name and where is the company registered?
