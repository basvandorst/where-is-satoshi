We are currently at a 6% transaction fee over market price at our Canadian exchange partner Vault of Satoshi.

Our Robocoin at West Edmonton Mall has had zero downtime in over 7 months of operation. Sounds like we need to expand our network. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 03:51:57
We installed the third Robocoin on the planet. What do you want to know?
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:18:16
In order to satisfy our banking relationship, in the serious grey area that currently clouds Bitcoin, we have MSB policies in place. This is comparable to information that online exchanges request. And we are testing uncharted waters by providing Bitcoin with physical automated locations. It's the only way to provide legal Bitcoin to the world. Aside from local bitcoins and Bitcoin startups playing with fire, you always need to provide some form of identification for transfer of fiat to Bitcoin.

We did post already, it's been consistently trading bitcoins for over two months now. Glad to see an unsuspecting bitcoiner enthused by their discovery!

It's consistently been at a 6% fee. Initially we were utilizing VoS, which led to higher than average cost, but have recently switched to Bitstamp for the liquidity and competitive pricing.

We wish it was instantly possible to provide this service for free, but starting up one of the first 10 Bitcoin ATMs in the country comes with a cost. Our rates are comparable to the other Bitcoin ATMs and you can buy or sell BTC in 5 minutes from start to finish (selling does need 1 confirmation). It may not be the most cost efficient method for the serious bitcoiners, but it has allowed over 100 people in 5 days to try something that was previously not possible. If we want to bring Bitcoin to the masses, there unfortunately will be costs to do so at the moment.

It's unfortunate we're having to practice KYC and AML procedures, but unless you know of a bank that will let us operate without these conditions we're stuck. As we're active members of the Canadian Bitcoin ATM community, we hear about how many bank accounts have been shut down and yet we remain with hundreds of customers that haven't complained and a solid banking relationship. There's many ways to obtain bitcoin anonymously if that is your personal preference.

Thanks for the post! Robocoin will be announcing some interesting news tomorrow. Looking forward to the advancement of these kiosks to higher levels!
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:12:52
To break even at 1% this machine would have to do millions in transactions monthly. If it gets to that point we surely would be able to drop the rates. This is about being able to simplify the process of bringing Bitcoin to the masses and with over 100 transactions in 5 days, it is inspiring those that were previously unable to obtain BTC or prefer not to use existing online methods.

No sign up, we are a brokerage/clearing house with Bitcoin ATM locations in BC and AB. Just get in touch with one of us on the page and once the e-transfer is sent and you provide a wallet address the BTC gets transferred immediately. We have many clients across the country that conduct exchange through this method. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:19:24
Every transaction issue we've had has been resolved within 24 hours and the kiosk has never been out of service. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:28:58
Thanks for coming down and glad you found it to be such a simple process. We really believe everyone should be able to get a chance to try Bitcoin and develop their own opinion of this new innovative technology.

As long as it is under $3000 per day we do pretty much instant e-transfers with any Canadian bank account.

These issues do happen with the BTMs and we remedy the situation as soon as possible, when required. Assuredly, we have been in contact with BitAccess the moment this post was noticed. We have never set the machines to more than 6% and are optimistic to bring rates lower as volume increases. Cheers.
@_date: 2015-07-14 05:05:18
Can confirm. We have 9 of them in operation. None of them have ever stated that to users, we assure you.

Hey Bob, 
We really are diligent with trying to ensure this Robocoin remains in working order. The people that are courteous enough to inform us that Robocoin has yet again dropped the ball in the Bitcoin Industry, get a very quick response time from one of us to reboot the Kiosk. I am unsure why your texts and emails do not get through, as I hope someone can vouch on here, we truly do try and make the best of a horrible situation. That is also why we have 8 BitAccess BTMs, and are actively working on fixing this issue for our fortunate location in WEM. I promise there is a plan of action to fix the issues you and many others are unfortunately witnessing in this fledgling industry.

Well guys, luckily there's a new network being deployed across western Canada as we speak. Our rates are less than half of this, and be sure to pay attention for upcoming promotions.
We're always free to help new customers.
