No I don't. Good point. What's the easiest website to use then? Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:14:27

@_date: 2016-06-29 10:21:25
Thank you!!

The storing of the money? What's to prevent someone copy and pasting a Bitcoin? (Obviously it's not that simple) 
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:31:35
Buying, selling and storing them? 
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:37:37
Thank you! I'll have to read! What's the alt though?

@_date: 2016-06-29 10:35:24
But I don't get it! Ahah. Whereas I know how to get money out of the bank 
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:31:10
Also is coin jar an exchange and why shouldn't I store my coins their? I'm a complete noob. Thanks! I need help lol 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:05:21
Never invest more than you can afford to loose. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:33:14
Thank you for the response! 
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:01:52
I've been using coin jar? Thoughts on them? Also what's a Poli payment is that hard to do? Sorry I'm new to Bitcoin, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:06:50
I'm really confused.... is using a service like shape shift more expensive than using an exchange like Poloniex? Thanks! Really trying to learn! 
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:39:56
Why didn't you just dig a hole in your yard and put it in a box in there under a pot 
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:10:34
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:53:29
As someone looking to buy. New to all this. I would much more likely if I could buy it a whole number not 0.00001 lol. As I have barely any money anyway 
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:23:35
I wonder where they get their prices from? I've noticed it's always different to say the CryptoCurrency market website...
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:26:32
What is there reason for doing that?
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:33:17
It's certainly had a ripple effect, that's all that I'll say.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:01:55
They don't understand it conceptually. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:08:20
Also how would you compare shape shift to A exchange like Poloniex? Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:52:44
That's like intense 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:08:59
They're in Australia if they're looking at CoinJar I'm guessing. I'm in Australia, and wondering the exact same question... 
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:12:34
It's why I bought litecoun instead lol so I can say I own x amount of coins 
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:33:49
Thank you for the response. I understand it now 
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:03:09
I'm not nervous. I just made the statement to trigger discussion. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:34:37
Thank your for the response. Makes sense to me now 
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:31:27
Btw I'm sure you get sick of people asking stupid questions so thanks in advance, much appreciated 
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:49:56
Wait does yes mean yes it will crash? 
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:34:25
Is changelly better than shape shift? 
@_date: 2016-07-05 11:14:27
Okay thanks! 
@_date: 2016-07-05 10:58:09
Does it literally print out the Bitcoin? Or does it send it somewhere else? Thanks!
