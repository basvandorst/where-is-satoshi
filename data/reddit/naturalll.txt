As a person who actually uses/likes the technology I can tell you that the story line about it only being a store of value or a way to speculate is not true. That's only the case during times when fees go to unreasonable amounts and it doesn't happen that often. When transaction fees are normal it's very good for paying people.
The technology is improving and the forecast for the future is the solutions of current problems and hence mass adoption and huge price tag per coin.
I am 100% staying in crypto for life, that said it doesn't hurt to sell before a dip and rebuy low.

Sadly it's getting propped at 10k by USDT not actual USD. We full on pyramid now. :(

The most telling thing is how much energy he puts into promoting the bitfinx/tether theory. He is clearly trying to achieve a specific outcome by promoting it so heavily. He's also promoting the by far worst case scenario, while there are plenty of likely scenarios where the outcome for the tether/bitfinx are no where close to apocalyptic. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he's shorting BTC or doing something similar that profits him from the BTC price dropping.

This could have been Stripe's pivot imo.

Why would you guys up vote a closed source app from an unknown developer based on words? If he's lying someone can lose a ton of money.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:02:41
You're comparing market cap to the amount of tether in circulation. 2.5 billion fake dollars are being used to manipulate the crypto market.

There are a bunch of different  mobile devices, wallets and platforms out there with varying levels of security exposure. Fact is anyone installing your app just based on this thread is making a mistake even if you're being 100% honest.

Not really. It's easy enough to accept bitcoin for payments without a third party. Overlooking open sourced code for doing so, there are still a lot  of services that do what stripe just stopped doing.

The bank is what actually provides the 2.3 bn USD

one of the promises of crypto is that governments can only complain but can't stop it
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:00:24
I think we won't drop below 8k for sure, the current FUD isn't strong enough, lot's of good debunks if you look. I am going to try to pick up some cheap coin as soon at 8500 if it doesn't break any time soon.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:29:33
This guy is an idiot who's trying to panic the market more for cheap coins. There's a ton of people who use it as an investment. And there are plenty who use it to buy and sell shit, specially on the darknet. There's also obvious news stories related to the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:33:08
Some people actually see beyond the FUD I guess, most predicted a rebound at 8-8.2 but it might be happening a bit early
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:32:00
we fighting back boys
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:46:40
Feels good knowing that bitcoin is proped by billions of dollars from corrupt politicians in ex soviet countries and south america, no where to go but up... eventually

Reasons for this DIP: India &amp; Bitfinx/Tether
DeFUDing India: Initial reports misrepresented what minister of finance said about crypto, claiming it was illegal and would be eliminated. The news spread like a wild fire on twitter. Hours later people translated the actual speech and it turned out to be "eliminate usage of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in criminal use cases." Infact, Indian crypto users got tax notices two weeks ago indicating India's plan to tax and regulate the crypto space.
DeFUDing Tether: There is fear that tether has no usd to back it's 2.3 billion coins in circulation and there is evidence that suggests this may be the case. However there is no way to know anytime soon. All crypto currencies besides tether are essentially not backed by any assets and rely on customer demand to establish a price. Crypto price depends on several factors like useful functionality, popularity and future prospects. Tether is very useful because it allows users to easily transfer fiat (substitute) between exchanges without having to pay for wire transfers and wait several days. It's also very popular because of this. Even if there was no FIAT in the bank (their pre audit in september had nearly half a billion in 3 banks) the crypto market could still valuate tether as worth $1 USD sans fiat and it would be valid under their Terms of Service and not necessarily against the law. Even if some agency was to invalidate tether (would be very hard) it would still not affect the market much because it's less than 1% of the entire market share. Some other things that relieve the FUDs: subpoena against tether came in December following the reported tether hack (as you would expect) not this week as fake news bloomberg reported, Bitfinx/Tether rep actually offered another bloomberg reporter to look at all their accounts in multiple banks if they sign a non disclosure, however the reported declined but reported this fact. Additionally, respected whaleclub.io member claims he has seen proof of Tether's fiat filled bank accounts and invites any non believers to come talk to him in whale club team chat.
Based on the way we stayed at 10k for a long time despite weeks of fud and because of recent Soros revelations of bitcoin being used for government corruption nest eggs I am guessing that BTC will bounce back fairly well after the panic settles a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:51:35
Roger that, dispatching 16th century cavalry charges!
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:29:37
So there was like 2 weeks of serious FUD where we bounced back to 10k each time.
Now we just hit with India FUD and Bitfinex FUD is still around.
Clever traders will research and see that neither is that serious and there's a good chance of us bouncing back to 10 again.
This is not financial advice.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:46:51
Or maybe they realize it's just FUD and pick up our discounted bitcoinz
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:06:09
There's over 3k BTC on buy around 8k just on gdax
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:30:52
Are you talking about 20-10k or what's happening now? 20 to 10k was an adjustment. This 1.5k dip is related to false bad news about India and Tether/Bitfinx.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:01:53
If it's bouncing off of 8500 for hours now I don't think it's going too far.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:42:07
lol, I typed up a pretty good article dispelling the FUD wonder at which point I should post it.
