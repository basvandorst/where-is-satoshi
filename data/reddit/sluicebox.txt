I just checked it, it is showing that it was received at the address I sent it to, which was my address I copied from Coinbase. But it doesn't show up in Coinbase.

I searched my BTC CB address on blockchain.info and it's saying there aren't any transactions.

I contacted them last week and they haven't responded. I will try again. Thank you!

I'm not sure, I'm pretty new to this stuff honestly, some of the technical jargon goes right over my head. I assumed it would at least show "pending". Are you saying that it is fine if it doesn't show up as pending and may just kick back to my trezor Wednesday?

Not OP, but came here for help. I sent BTC from trezor to CB almost 2 weeks ago and the funds haven't shown up as pending in my CB account. They are nowhere. I lowered the gas to the point that it said it would take 2.5 days or not at all... I thought "not at all" meant it would bounce back. So far nothing... I contacted CB support and they haven't responded either. I'm beyond stressed!

It's not quite 2 weeks yet. It will be 2 weeks on Wednesday, so maybe there's hope? The most concerning thing is that it isn't showing up at all on Coinbase. Trezor shows the send but Coinbase isn't showing that it received it at all.

I did the same thing, my BTC is missing now for 2 weeks, it doesn't show up as pending or any record of it in my Coinbase account. The BTC is just gone and hasn't bounced back. Should I keep waiting?

Thank you for taking the time to help me! It doesn't say anything about confirmed or not, blockchain.info just says there was one transaction and it shows the address, which is correct, as far as I can tell. 
To back up, I copied the address from my app on my phone and emailed it to myself. I then copied it from my email to my trezor account as the address I wanted the BTC sent to. 
The address on the blockchain.info matches the email address I copied it from. 
The blockchain.info only shows me the address, hash 160, tools, no. of transactions (1), total received, final balance, and the original trezor address. 
Edit: I just found it, it has 701 confirmations...
Edit 2: now it says 702 confirmations...
Edit 3: appears to be counting up confirmations...

Trezor, I can try!

Nothing from the government is "free".

The fed isn't a governmental agency.

This has been my plan as well. Though I have toyed around with selling a certain percentage when it's high in hopes of buying more when it's low. Ultimately though I look at it as a long term investment that grows steadily over time.

I bought BTC on Coinbase on the 11th and it's still pending. Should I be concerned?
