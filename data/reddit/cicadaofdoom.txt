I say it like that because you word big miners as if all big miners are shared companies. 'big miners are owned by many shareholders.' you didnt say most, or some, or a few.. You just said big miners = owned by lots of people... Which, is *not* true.. Theres a single man who owns 10% of the pool. If a billionaire went to an aids ridden, malaria infested, poverty striken slum and gave everybody 0.01 btc(wow thats like 5$ man!), does that mean btc is better now? Does it make it more powerful because hes given away a fraction of a percent dispersed out between millions of people? No.

Just like im free to run for president... Costs alot of money. The mining world is no longer every body getting a little piece... Its a few big fish getting way bigger, at a rate that cannot be competed with, without millions of dollars. Mining is no longer a thing for every man and his graphics card.. Its for rich people to get richer.

I think you are right. I would rather leave my unauthorized use of cc to an occasion out of my comtrol haha. Im just gonna buy some with cash.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:12:27
I dont understand. If it is me who is the buyer of btc, and i buy with paypal trusting that they then send me the btc after recieving the money into thier paypal from my paypal, is there any risk at all to me?  Does paypal now side with sellers? I cant foresee any problem besides for him, if people do chargebacks.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:27:41
Im not selling, im buying

Thing is with hardware, you have to get it right the first time, especially when it comes to hardware that will be potentially mass adopted by people using said hardware to secure billions of dollars. If the mess anything up they lose every customer, current and future. I can see why its taking so long.

Can anyone tell me why manned kiosks are not a viable option? Similar to western union or a currency exchange kiosk?

Yeah, that was stupid. 'Hey... Ah, BMW? Yeah can you replace my tranmission please, its screwed but still under 100'000km, thats sweet right? ?. ''sure, tell us about when this happened, how were you driving?'' ... 'Well, I was doing some burn outs when I was like fuuuyck this, I should be drifting all day erry day, so I start blasting through the gears going 180k completely sideways while eating a tube of strait raw wasabi like RAAAWR man it was intense! Oh yeah so I was pulling in my drive and I noticed it was making a really wierd noise after that' ...

No they dont have to hold it, simply drip feed, like diamonds. Hold a large percent of a market, and artifially increase value of said market by keeping supply less than demand.

You release it slowly enough to get your initial investment then everythings profit. I didnt even mention how much you could manipulate the market with such a stake in it... Youd never run out.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:30:38
Thats good. People will find out very quickly if you do, and with your address being a big part of your business these guys know where to come and find you. I think as long as you operate legit, you should make decent money. Good luck.

Im sure if enough people believe.. Then we will get to mars! Umm no.. The company has 0% chance.. Given that they 1, dont have nearly the right team of people running this and 2, we couldnt get to the moon on crowd sourcing, let alone mars. So many things you are probably unaware of in relation to going to mars.. Without most of the world working together and massive(hundreds of billions or trillions) amounts of money/resources, we simply cant.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:51:17
To those who ask or disbelieve that this is profitable.. Well almost anything times a million is profitable as long as its positive income obviously. 1% of a dollar being a cent, and 1% of a million dollars being $10'000, means even at 1c a person, its some money.. Imagine some apps easily getting that a day. You get the idea. It's big money, especially if you own multilple apps and sell meta data ripped from the phone that you had to approve to in order to play that cool as game when installing. Add in advertising, and obviously some in-game purchases needed to get past a certain point... Yup.. Big money.

This site does infact put the address in the checkout of paypal. I thought the same thing as i was going through the checkout.

Could I not, worst case scenario, say to my bank that i didnt authorize the transaction, and get my money back?

It should be renamed from mars one to mars zero... Cause thats the percentage of them succeeding. If the richest countries in the world arent doing it, and in fact saying they wont due to cost... Do you really think a small company run by a dozen known scammers and fraudsters, that relys on random anon donations, is going to actually get to mars? Its a joke.

Even if that was true, nothing is stopping the elite from controlling a massive amount of btc either by already privately owning massive mining operations and refusing to sell shares of it, or by buying up a massive operation now that 'peasants' who arent billionaires cant match.
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:03:30
Yeah... That's a scam. The directors of the company have bad or dodgey pasts and as pointed out, their plan is ridiculous and wont happen. You've been scammed if you sent them money.

Coinbase is a pretty big hurdle when not american and for such a small amount
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:03:41
End every transfer of btc to yourself with a unique amount. Ie, you want to transfer 1 btc, you transfer 1.0005566, and then you know that all transactions ending in 5566 are yours.

So it sounds like the only one stressing about and talking about the drop is you. Chill out mate im sure your btc are fine.
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:38:47
Umm this has nothing to do with the price drop? I'm talking about the seemingly unavoidable monopolization of bitcoin among a few wealthy.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:43:13
I think, if you as a btc user have not been keeping your tracks covered extensively, you should definitely pay tax. However, if you have been pretty undercover, I would deny having any involvement in cryptos. It would also be a good time to stop bei g so bltant about your btc usage if you currently are so that when the next financial year starts you can atleast start avoiding btc gains tax then.

There are ways to buy bitcoins anonymously

Wow thanks! Time to learn about tips I guess haha.
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:55:04
Ok, lets use your analogy. There are 100 house properties. 50 have already been developed, 50 waiting to have houses built on them(mined). Currently, 40 houses are owned by the public, 10 by developers - people wanting more property. These 10 developers are rich, and they are the ones who for the most part developed the other 40 properties. The public eimply bought thier houses, they didnt build them, and that money went to developers who will build on the other 50.
The I, Mr. Burns come along, and, at a higher than current market rate bought all the developers building companies. I produced the future remaining 50 houses, and because the population is rising, I sell them.. But so slowly, because im artificially keeping the market worth twice itw value but only as long as i hold the houees.

I'll elaborate on staying anonymous - you can buy bitcoin with fiat by anonymously depositing via cash into a deposit slot at the bank. Most if not all banks have a self-service deposit facility, that doesnt require going to the teller or showing any ID. Theres one on the side of a shop at a mall near me, no problem wearing a hoody and sunglasses if your *that* paranoid. You can also buy gift cards aninymously and sell for btc.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:29:37
Yeah, and it also would correlate nicely with the Houser emails talking about the mtgox wallet switches.. Hmm. Mark is gonna get ripped a new bumhole me is thinking, people wont like this. Good thing i avoided gox haha

Just so you know, its not uncommon for drug dealers/criminals to rig packages with cameras inside streaming so they know at what point and by who that it gets opened. Id be careful about stealing mail if I was you, people will get upset.
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:02:27
The price matters because things are still priced in fiat then paid with the current rate of exhange btc is at.. Also, the price matters because people, alot of them do not mine! It's no longer a game for all. I can't just plug in a decent gaming rig anymore and get a bit of btc, I need special hardware that is a high risk on return, and cost alot of money. 
That is why the price going up and down is a big subject. Why you cannot see that is beyond me.
@_date: 2014-03-31 06:30:50
No you cant make that argument for all wealth. Bitcoins are not unlimited like fiat so they can *actually* be drip fed, aswell as the fact that one cannot buy a printing press that creates money, that you can buy for less than the amount that it will produce(but only if you can invest massive amounts initially). This is a major flaw.
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:25:46
Yeah.. But 0.01 is like, 6 bucks.. Pretty far from 200.
