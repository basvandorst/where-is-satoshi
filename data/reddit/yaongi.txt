This is misleading - most people use an address for each transaction. 78% of bitcoins are in addresses with no outgoing transactions, but that doesn't imply they're in savings accounts. Those could be transitional addresses - if you use an address for each transaction, then if there's money at that address (no matter how temporarily), by this definition it's a saving account.
The authors then look at a three month cut off. This gives 60% of 78% or about 47%. So 47% of bitcoins look to be in savings accounts, which doesn't sound so bad.
The main difference between bitcoin and other currencies is that other currencies have more investment opportunities. Aside from ponzi schemes and mining companies there aren't a lot of places to put bitcoin. If you save money in a bank, it (and a corresponding amount of money produced from thin air) is lent out. Safely lending out bitcoin is a bit tough at the moment.

If using ascii, it'd be cheaper to use decimal encoding, since the maximum value in each transaction would be 127  (128? not sure if zero btc transactions are legal) satoshis. 
Since this probably requires pre-communication anyway, encoding a-z and a couple of punctuation marks would allow each character to be sent with a maximum of 30 satoshis or so. But then with precommunication a compressed form that minimises cost (by actual amount sent vs transaction fees) could be agreed upon. 
Or they could just provide an email address, I guess. 
There have been cases in anonymous bidding where lower digits in the bids are used to communicate intentions to the other parties to lower competition - maybe this happened with auctioning of radio spectrum somewhere, can't remember.

You won't know if they know.
