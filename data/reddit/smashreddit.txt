It's pretty cut and dry as "unlawful" in any of those jurisdictions. BVI is the one that matters and it is absolutely "unlawful" there. If they are insolvent, then you don't get to start making your own debt structures. There is law that kicks in automatically. It is open and shut "unlawful" in the jurisdiction that the applicable company is incorporated. You don't need to be a lawyer, you'll see it as soon as you even scratch the surface of reading about it.  
  
Whether or not it's "illegal" or criminal is another story. It could be entirely a civil matter. But don't kid yourself that what they're doing is kosher.

Stop this shit, there is no reason to act like anyone deserved it for using an exchange. Especially not one that markets itself as legit. This has nothing to do functionally with bitcoin, but this short sighted attitude is definitely going to hold it back. I get that we want ZERO regulation, but without some sort of exchange regulation, you can't have exchanges, and without exchanges, you're going to have a hard time seeing the bitcoin prices you enjoy so much. People need to trust that the big name exchanges are legit and they need to be held accountable. Stop trying to blame the people who use them.

It's probably not practical if you only had a small amount on the site, but consulting a lawyer is probably the best option, honestly. If there are time sensitive things at play here, they could very well be stalling. The other alternative is to do nothing and trust that they have your best interests in mind. Like I said, everything might turn out roses, but I think people are being lulled by Zane.  
  
On some level, this a weird type of extortion on their part : "Yeah, we acted inappropriately, but if you try to hold us accountable, it will take you years to get your money, just take this hastily put together plan because it's the best way for you to get some money back quickly". Talk to a lawyer, maybe a free consultation. BitFinex in uncharted water at best and there are definitely some things that might play out different with regulatory agencies involved. It may take longer, but you could potentially get more out of it. End of the day, it's your decision, just go into it with your eyes open : you have no reason as of now to trust BitFinex.

Thanks for the advice guys, went with a new email and my real name. I'm sure my real name is compromised out there in the web somewhere anyways.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:40:03
That's exactly what I'm saying. Bitcoin has not been legally recognized as a currency, so the safety deposit box analogy might be more correct.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:57:38
Let's be real dude, we're both dealing with unknowns. I don't know how much more a lawyer could get out of it, but as of right now, no one who has money on the site knows for sure that they're going to get back anything.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:23:27
This doesn't confirm anything! Zane already said they were working with authorities, now he says they are working with FBI. They very well might be, but we have NO evidence that they are. We also have no evidence that a hack even took place. This is not a conspiracy theory people, everything BitFinex is saying may very well be true, but you can't just trust the word of an informal spokesperson and act like everything is fine! This is NOT transparency, please don't be lulled into thinking it is.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:19:35
How do we even know that they were hacked? Seriously, outside of what they've said through announcements and zane, what evidence have you seen that they were compromised?
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:53:44
Don't make bitcoin bigger than what it is. It is the protocol and implementation of a cryptocurrency. What happens around that is not necessarily bitcoin related.  
 
Let me ask you a couple of things to judge exactly where you stand on regulators :  
  
1. If you run an exchange and take customer's bitcoins, do you think a crime has been committed (in whatever applicable jurisdiction)? You have tricked the customer's into thinking they had control of their coins deposited with you, but then it was revealed that you had enough keys to take full control of the coins.  
2. If you gain unauthorized access to a system and take the system's customers' coins by using some vulnerability in the backend to take control of the keys, do you think a crime has been committed (in whatever applicable jurisdiction)?
3. If a person came to your house with a gun, pointed it at your head and had you write down your private keys and addresses, then left and took control of the coins in those addresses, do you think a crime would have been committed?
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:55:34
Ok, so look at it a different way. Do you think losing money like this is just a cost of doing business with bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:16:09
You say this, but I'm not sure there is a legal precedent to absolutely say that was the case in this situation. This is new ground. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:16:47
People need to start realizing that there is no evidence of a hack outside of what Bitfinex has said. There have been no statements from any authorities, there has been no explanation of how it happened. This is not to say that they're lying, but until this information comes out, people need to have their guard up.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:37:14
I'm asking if you think any of these situation are crimes? Crimes being that they could have implications outside of the bitcoin protocol?
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:32:35
lose here, means gambling loss. So this is the part I'm not sure of, the site I moved the money to was for gaming with bitcoins. It wasn't like you sent them bitcoins and they gave you a credit for the amount of $USD the BTC was worth at the time. And then lets say I lost them.  
  
Is the technical IRS interpretation here that as soon as I moved my BTC to the gambling site that I was exchanging them for a service? If so, the technical scenario is that if they were worth $200 at the time that I transferred them I had a capital gain of $100, but then I get no offset that the "service" involved me losing all $200 worth of "digital property"? The $200 lost would be gambling losses and could be used to offset any gambling wins, but not any capital gains. So in this scenario losing $200 cost me short_term_capital_gains_rate x $100?
  
Unfortunately, I think this is the technical interpretation and it makes me sick. I guess this has always been the case, but the recent Coinbase/IRS stuff has really brought it to light. My original plan was that anytime I went from BTC back into USD (or purchased an item/service that had a USD price associated with it) I would pay tax then. I don't think I ever really grasped that I was creating tax events all over the place even when no USD was involved.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:56:46
I admit that I have much to learn, but I can't tell if you're the one I should be learning it from because I can't even make out what point you're trying to make?  
  
The point I'm making is that if Coinbase gives the IRS records that show you as selling bitcoin at whatever the price happens to be when you move it into your wallet your immediately on the defensive as far as proof because depending on your transactions this could trigger an IRS audit that wouldn't have happened otherwise. It's not about whether you can get accounting together, it's about never being put in a situation where you would need to. I'm not sure what you're trying to say?
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:50:45
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think he's concerned about Coinbases internal tax report, he's concerned about what the reporting going to the IRS is going to look like.  
  
He's concerned that it looks like it's going to be reported as sales to the IRS, which switches the onus on him to have records that can then prove that it wasn't a sale, whereas if Coinbase was reporting only on actual sales made from the site, a person wouldn't feel this pressure to keep records of internal transactions and would have to only worry about transactions that were actual sales to fiat, or transactions for services, or transactions for goods. This is relatively easy compared to having to prove to the IRS that you still own bitcoin or to keep records of all transfers that happened after btc left Coinbase.  
  
If all of this goes down like it looks like it's going to go down, my perception is that a Coinbase customer is going to have a completely different Bitcoin experience than a non Coinbase customer. Feel free to correct any of this if it's inaccurate (this is my current understanding of the situation), but if Coinbase reports outgoing transactions as sales, a Coinbase user will have to keep records of everything that happens to that parcel of purchased bitcoin because the Coinbase user knows that as far the initial information the IRS has, the Coinbase user sold bitcoin at whatever price it was when he moved it to his wallet. So if he moves it from his software wallet to another software wallet to a site (where he doesn't spend it) to his hardware wallet, he needs to have records for every step of the way because the IRS thinks he sold it based on Coinbase records, so the Coinbase user is immediately on the tax defensive to prove he has not created a taxable event. I may not understand it completely, so please correct.  
  
I've really enjoyed using Coinbase, but this hassle will not be worth it. I think my plan right now is to take the hit, move everything off of Coinbase and GDAX, report all my moves off the site as taxable events, pay the tax for 2016, never use the Coinbase/GDAX services again and be done with.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:27:03
I'm either making my point wrong or you're not understanding me. 


Exactly. I'm saying that if Coinbase gives data to the IRS that shows all outgoing transactions as sales it will lead to more auditing, which means people will be required to gather information for the audit, which they wouldn't have had to do if Coinbase hadn't set them up to look auditable in the first place.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:33:20
I see what you're saying and after reading through this I think I triggered it by saying maintaining records as being the problem and you're saying the maintaining should be happening anyways, which I agree with, to an extent.    
  
Act like instead of 'maintaining records', I said 'potentially go through the hassle of an audit.' Even if you've got all your ducks in a row, do you want to get audited?
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:47:57
I didn't sell for gambling, I actually lost money, I'm not sure this is accurate based on my limited understanding of the IRS memo.  
  
The Steam games are the only thing that had a corresponding $USD price.
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:35:24
It isn't illegal to gamble online, it's illegal for payment processors to process payments to known gambling sites.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:37:22
No, bitcoin does not work by keeping auditable records of how your bitcoin moves internally outside the world of fiat. That's the complete opposite of zero trust. Buy bitcoin with usd = basis, sell bitcoin for usd (or good/service with usd price) = taxable (price - basis). That should be end of story here.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:04:47
I'm probably misusing the word tax event. Losing money can be a tax event as well, right?  
  
Maybe not now that I think about it. If I buy a "digital property" worth $100 and move that "digital property" to another site at the time when the "digital property" is worth $200 and then lose the "digital property" what happened from an IRS standpoint?  
  
thinking out loud here.
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:12:19
Do we know how far back we are going with the records? If there is any silver lining here, it's that there is a finite amount of time involved and future hassle can be avoided by transferring everything out of Coinbase and GDAX before the end of the year.  
  
Honestly, I think at this point, it's the only safe move to pull everything off the site until this gets sorted out. If you have anything in a Coinbase/GDAX account on Jan 1, 2017 you are risking another headache next year.
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:44:36
This is key and needs to be better communicated.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:41:53
I know it won't, that's why I said I would just eat the loss and act like their records were correct. That I 'sold' bitcoin for x price after buying it for y price and pay the capital gains tax on the difference and be done with it.
Edit : sorry, just realized I said this in another similar post, not this one. Closing account before Jan 1, 2017 was more about stopping the creation of any future records there rather than mitigating old records.
@_date: 2016-11-02 22:30:07
Post-only is most definitely checked. The order is not posting, that is the underlying problem. Let's say my balance is showing $350. That should be enough to place a limit order to buy .5 at $700, right? Well, not for me. I would need to have 350.07 to place the buy order at .5. The prefill all THINKS I have enough, but when I try to place the order I get the "Insufficient Funds" popup. I would have to adjust down to .4999 btc before I would be able to post the buy order. Once the order is placed, I can check and see that it is holding all $350.  
  
Thanks for responding. Did you read the issue before you responded?
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:38:46
Maybe I missed something then, from what the Coinbase representatives on reddit have said turning over the customer data will be done in a way that reports all outgoing transactions as sales?  
  
Honestly, I just assumed customer data = tax records. I didn't even think about the implications of them giving the IRS EVERYTHING. I don't even know what the implications are, but they strike me as not great.
@_date: 2016-11-02 22:39:40
As soon as I can personally confirm that it refunds the extra .0001*limit price (waiting on a buy order to fill), I will be sure to send an email with as much pertinent information as possible to help with the cosmetic bug. Otherwise I'm going to be sending a different email.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:08:07
Pretty sure you'd have to PROVE they didn't have correct information, which means maintaining records simply for the purpose of disproving Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:09:39
You missed a piece of news that is brewing that a judge (not sure what level of judge) has ruled that Coinbase has to turn over customer data to the IRS.  
  
Coinbase says they are going to fight it, but that's what this is about. A representative also said, that if they are forced to report to the IRS, they will report all outgoing transactions from the site as bitcoin sales.
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:46:55
It was hard to understand because they just clarified that position in this very thread. They ARE (most likely) going to be compelled to give the IRS customer data, up until this thread it APPEARED that it was going to follow the same precedent as the report. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 15:53:33
What is some evidence behind this?
@_date: 2016-09-21 16:15:54
Bitcoin is in this sweet spot where it is cheap enough that someone could manipulate it and expensive enough to make it worth it. I do think there is a lot of noise, but if there is money to be made, manipulation has to at least be considered. I don't think bitcoin manipulation is as hard to profit from as you're letting on, it doesn't take relatively very much to start a big price move in either direction, and unlike traditional assets like stocks, there is nothing to pin a fundamental value to.
@_date: 2016-09-08 22:01:31
I think something similar to this is what happened to Bitfinex. It could be coincidence, but they got "hacked" the day the market was dropping like 10%. We still haven't seen any evidence of a hack or an investigation of a hack. Owner didn't even send an email to customers until weeks after the incident. It all just seemed very fishy.
@_date: 2016-07-29 03:14:56
no, we're talking about bitcoin, which is considered digital cash. Comparing bitcoin to paypal in this particular scenario is comparing apples to oranges.
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:38:19
This doesn't sound good, so you have literally staked your financial well being on BTC rising past a certain point in the future. Beyond the scope of this post, I really think you should reconsider that. Keep in mind that if you are literally invested in it to the point that you need it to rise, that's going to cloud your judgement. You need to make sure all of this excitement you see on the horizon is actually there and not you trying to internally justify your decision.  
  
But that being said...I think it is going to rise over 700 eventually. But regardless, I wouldn't hodl more than you can afford to have go to zero.

@_date: 2016-07-28 18:26:42
I never thought about it like that, I don't think enough is done to make it obvious that a bitcoin is 1.00000000. It really might make it seem more accessible to people. If you didn't know that it could be broken up, which seems obvious to us but probably isn't to new people, you would think "well shit, I don't have $600 dollars to spend right now". I think in the future we are going to talk about things more in terms of mBtc, uBtc, and Satoshis. I'm going to remember to start explaining that aspect of bitcoin to my friends.
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:58:56
What is stupid about it? Cash and credit cards already have massive amounts of utilization. They are established. BTC is the new player. I don't think it's stupid at all to ask these questions.
@_date: 2016-07-29 03:18:10
It didn't move at the event, which could be a very simple sign that the halving was priced in pretty efficiently.

How much of the value of bitcoin comes from those current (active) markets and how much of it comes from the scarcity, secure asset (passive) side? There's no quantifiable answer, I'm just curious what people in general think is the more important side.
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:50:44
good one for sure.
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:52:07
I think you can already do this with P2P lenders, bitcoin would certainly be an alternative way to do it, but I'm not sure if this is something unique to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-28 20:15:00
Things like this make me realize there really is something called "privilege" even if the term is completely overused/misused. I didn't even take that into account. I've never fallen into that category and I just took it for granted that access to banking was a given. But even so, you could argue that there is a significant overhead to use bitcoin as your bank alternative. Internet, computer, etc. Also, given that people that are underbanked, which implies less assets for the most part, how significantly could this effect the underlying value? It would definitely be a force driving the price up, but how strongly would it drive it?
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:56:43
What exciting new developments of bitcoin and blockchain do you think are not factored in to the current price that would make it suddenly go to 3k before Jan2017? I'm probably coming off as a little cynical, but my question was more about what the utilizations of bitcoin are/will be and how much of those utilizations is the price based on. I'm assuming you're hodling btc, I am too, and I would love for it to shoot to 3k by the end of the year, but let's be real, it very well might not, it might never, but that doesn't mean it's a failure at all.  
  
Let's say we had a crystal ball that told us it would never rise above 700USD ever again, what would you use it for besides speculating on it growing? What exciting developments would you utilize with btc?
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:30:58
This falls more on the passive side then on the active side. They could just as easily tip you in cash. Having bitcoin expecting it to go up is not utilization, it's banking on the scarcity/passive side of bitcoin, which is fine, but I wouldn't consider this active.
@_date: 2016-07-28 19:02:06
but they are spending it
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:33:05
It is digital cash in that whoever possesses it, has it. If you lose your cash out of your wallet irl, it's gone, same with bitcoin. It is more traceable than cash. The types of transactions really don't figure in to it. You wouldn't use your digital cash directly at a brick and mortar convenience store and you can't use your real cash directly at an online store.
@_date: 2016-07-28 20:42:04
What were the conversion fees at both ends, if you don't mind me asking? Also, it seems that even in bitcoin the underbanked are going to be taken advantage of. Using the US as an example, it is much cheaper to use the exchanges where a bank is required than localbitcoin. How good is it going to be for serving the underbanked if they're immediately at a disadvantage for converting to/from bitcoin? I don't know how we could fix that here in the US given banking regulations. Just look at all the hoops Coinbase has to jump through and the end result is a completely un-anonymous, bank dependent entry into the blockchain for most new users.
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:29:35
Is there any chance that ETH will cut into this idea first? Even if it does, does it matter? I think even if ETH (or ETC) takes off, BTC will always be there. Almost like gold is still there, even though we have paypal/cc's/etc.
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:53:12
Good point, definitely an assumption I made. It's a way of getting digital convenience of bank amenities without having a bank.
@_date: 2016-07-28 16:59:02
Are the fee's really cheaper though? I'm not saying they're not (I don't have accurate data on the past, present, future predicitions of fees), but I just don't consider moving small amounts of bitcoin as a fee efficient thing.
I agree that the scarcity, immutability, and security are big on the value and ultimately why I don't think BTC is going to go anywhere. But I feel like it has to have some sort of utility over a regular currency to remain valuable (I have admittedly not fleshed this feeling out, maybe it doesn't, my gut reaction is that it does).

I explain it to people as digital gold. I think you may be dead on with the progression. Does it worry you at all that during the days of digital gold it could potentially get funneled up to a small group of whales? I go back and forth in thinking that it will be a problem. It would certainly drive the price up for those that are hodling now, but could be harmful in the long run.
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:31:02
I think you're just throwing the word "easily" out there. There are probably going to be increasing number of third party libraries that help abstract away the difficulty, but with BTC, anything you ask to help you (in this case libraries) have the tradeoff of giving up some portion of the security side of BTC. As time goes on, this will probably get better, but I don't think it's fair to say you just easily embed BTC into websites.
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:44:37
Why is there real world value extremely low in your eyes? I got into bitcoin originally for a very real utility reason and I continue to use it for utility and speculatively. Admittedly more speculatively now but only because I was impressed by the utility.  
  
I will admit that I think there are utility scenarios for bitcoin people push that don't make sense now and possibly not ever (the cup of coffee situation) but that doesn't mean there aren't other situations where it will be extremely useful and valuable.
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:32:39
why? just a hunch? if it does go to 3k, do you think it will be correctly priced there? (not correct in a strict market hypothesis definition type way where the price is ALWAYS correct because someone paid it, but correct in a sustainable way)
