Just for my own knowledge, if a mining pool got too big and had most of the hashrate could they censor transactions? Or is there something in place to combat this?

Sometimes companies go public to raise capital and expand faster (not saying that’s the case here) but for other companies that would never have been able to get that big that fast without doing an IPO

Original article probably said 2/3 - but now 1/3 of the wealthy people joined in and are no longer wealthy.

The market cap is different, much more money involved. That 15% drop now represents a lot more money. Lol a 15% drop now is more than the entire btc market cap back then.

I would think that the dollar has been around long enough that people might not need to google how to buy, store or use it as oppose to bitcoin which might be less accessible and more tech demanding. 
Regardless I like that people are still searching about bitcoin nonetheless - also glad it’s a global phenomenon.

This video actually scared me.  I don’t hold much btc just mostly alts.  But bought back in very little into btc to try day trading a little....now I’m scared that maybe I should just hold onto that little btc since I might miss out on those 10 big days lol.

Because the code is open source and people can see it.  If the government was on the blockchain and transparent, I think we would trust it more too - but we can’t even see our presidents tax returns or how half the money in government is spent.

Does burning it to a burn address just make the supply scarce artificially pumping the price but the market cap stays high since those coins still exist or can coinmarketcap take those coins out of the circulating supply and lower the overall market cap down?
