Cool dude. You're a Keynesian so please ignore my analysis as I said at the beginning. 
Also, please go fix California's water supply problem that resulted from the government fixing water price and not allowing it to rise with demand. 
Have a good one.

I would question the very idea that you need such an algorithm at all.
If you believe that some magic central algorithm or bank needs to stimulate you to buy porn (or any product for that matter) via printing money, then please move on.  You are a Keynesian and this post will do nothing but anger you.
The main argument for having monetary policy is to keep the currency "stable" relative to other currencies and goods.  For the purposes of this post, I will ignore stability in relation to other currencies as attempting to create an algorithm that keeps crypto currencies stable compared to fiat (which are controlled by central banks) defeats the entire point of crypto currencies as it pegs them to a fiat controlled benchmark.  
The forces of competition and supply and demand (a la the invisible hand) take care of all "needs" for monetary policy in general.  As with any good, when demand rises, its relative cost in relation to other goods rises.  When we deal with a finite supply of a currency in relation to this good, it becomes easy to measure how much demand has driven up the price because the only variable changing is demand for the product (IE more people want it).  
When demand rises, the price will rise and will inevitably cause some of those holding that good to sell in order to get other goods at the superior price.  Further, as the price of the good rises, those desiring to buy it further will diminish since it now costs more relative to other goods.  These two forces will cause the price to fall.  
**To give a concrete example:**
Envision that I have created a crypto currency with a finite amount of coins at 10 total.
Also envision that I have 10 apples in the entire world, and the coins and apples are the only goods in existence.  Assume apples never go bad and are never eaten (IE they are essentially another finite currency).
* Current Apple : Imaginary Coin exchange rate = 1
If people demand more imaginary coins for whatever reason, they will sell apples in mass. Because no one will exchange your 1 apple for 1 imaginary coin, you will be forced to sell 2 apples to get an imaginary coin.  This will drive up imaginary coin prices.
* New Apple :  Imaginary Coin Exchange Rate = 2 (Because you need 2 apples to receive 1 imaginary coin)
As the price of Imaginary coin continues to rise in terms of apples, you will see some people thinking it doesn't make sense to give up that many apples for 1 imaginary coin.  As a result, less people will sell apples.  Further, some of those that held only imaginary coins will see the new rates and begin purchasing more apples.  This will drive price back down.
* New Apple : Imaginary Coin Exchange Rate = 1 (Because less people wanted to sell apples for coins and some coin holders "cashed out")
This process will repeat itself infinitely and will inevitably cause the price of the good (in our case imaginary coin) will stabalize to some value that will only change because either people want it more or there is a larger supply of some other good in relation to it.
**Why hasn't bitcoin reached this stability yet?**
As with any decentralized mechanism, the point of equilibrium cannot be reached until it is a widely used and distributed good (IE not illiquid).  Bitcoin specifically will inevitably reach this point as it reaches critical mass in terms of total number of coins mined (the 21MM marker) and more people begin using it.  
**Conclusion** 
As mentioned at the beginning, the invisible hand will force the price of a finite currency to its equilibrium because all that can change it are demand for it and supply of other goods in relation to it.  There is no need for monetary policy, and most only think this because they have been brainwashed into thinking it.  
If you don't believe me that monetary policy is unnecessary, then consider for a moment that one of the main reasons that Keynesians advocate for monetary policy is to "stimulate" demand.  When was the last time you ever needed someone to tell you to buy food?

My main point was that a currency should have a fixed supply.  That allows its value to scale based off of supply/demand of products surrounding it.  It allows for a benchmark to be used when gauging one product's value vs another (which is the point of a currency, a medium of exchange for other products).
Historically, gold filled this role because it was all we had that was mostly finite (although not quite), and it was very easily divisible (melt it down).  Bitcoin does this even better because since it is electronic, it is infinitely divisible.
If you desire to increase the supply of bitcoin, you are stepping into the realm of Keynesian/Central Bank economics, and you won't agree with my analysis.  As such, I believe Bitcoin is superior than any other currency attempting to manipulate its quantity (and you are free to disagree!).
