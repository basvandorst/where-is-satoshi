If that's what drew your focus in my reply then that's too bad.  There's a bigger issue being discussed here than trying to imaginatively personify usernames based on the phrases they choose to use.

So when an entity becomes too large it gains so much power that it could corrupt the integrity of the system for its own gain?
That sounds quite familiar in the world of currency, not to mention it's in contradiction to the entire selling point of bitcoin.
...and the cracks begin to show.

I'm not sure what you mean especially since the word "cringe" itself has become as overused as "creepy" here.
Feel free to be more articulate and I'll happily respond or explain.

You missed the critical e-05 part of that number.

The QR can be for a wallet to which you don’t have the keys.  If someone were to transfer actual coins to an address in the QR, they would effectively be transferring into the hands of whoever created the coin and may have retained the private keys.
If you ask me, this is a thinly veiled scam waiting to happen at this point.  Sell a fancy coin to someone virtually inviting them to transfer their coins to that wallet treating it like a bank account before realizing it’s now gone forever.
Be careful.  Buy for commemorative or real physical value only.  Newbs: This means don’t ever transfer anything to any address shown on the coin.

See my comment next to yours.  It’s definitely scary that many might perceive this as a great place to store their coins without understanding crypto.  I predict a similar scam in less than 2 months.
