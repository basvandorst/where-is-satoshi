Web of Trust doesn't seem to like it either (though that's not necessarily an indictment)

"Our corporate tax rates are the highest in the developed world."
If that's the second sentence, I don't even want to think about how misleading the rest of the video is going to be.

I made a point to say "misleading," because it is technically true, though practically about an order of magnitude off.

So many things ... mostly formatting.
I'll just start with your bitcoin inflation data from the early 90s.
@_date: 2014-09-21 14:50:22
No, it's not. The inflation rate of BTC in the '90s isn't zero, it doesn't exist.

Going to war seems like more than a 1% issue....

NYT had a  pretty conseqential Trump leak recently

I guess people here forgot A Antonopolus was on his show about 3 times, each for 2 or 3 hours at a time.

There are plenty of incorrect things that educated adults can say

Maybe somewhere not in the US

If I buy a couch to a stranger for $100 and he uses that money to buy drugs that end up killing him, am I legally responsible?
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:38:35
Yes, and Princeton recently published a study that claimed the US is an oligarchy
@_date: 2019-09-15 19:56:58
And? I'm not responsible for what adults do with their money. If somebody wants to do drugs, they're going to. I have no interest in helping them score drugs but "have I ever engaged in a transaction that might have eventually gone to drugs or harm?" is a slippery slope. It's like a liquor salesman being charged with murder for somebody driving drunk and killing a pedestrian.

TPP or not, that's a demonstrably false statement. His positions on crony capitalism may be better than his GOP cousins, but he doesn't shun corporate funding.

That's what the flying space monkeys WANT YOU TO BELIEVE

While I think it would be great for them to poll higher and get into debates, etc., it's a bit of a buzzkill that he's been in debate(s) before and was basically forgettable.
