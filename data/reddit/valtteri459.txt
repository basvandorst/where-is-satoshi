maybe someone here can help him to figure out why they did not want it, anything you have said is no reason to be mean/negative to others :(

"nobody here" - prove that, maybe someone here knows where to ask, you dont know them all, if he gets approved, then bitcoin will be included. 
maybe someone knows where to ask how to get his items to overstock.

he just asked, is it wrong to ask?
he just wants to sell his products for bitcoins to increase bitcoin economy. you buttcoiners are quite mean people, i go back to enjoy the friendliness of .

yes, is not his marketing team, but if someone asks for help, why not help, why just be negative, why not tell where to ask, and yes, more merchants using a certain currency makes it more wanted and raises the value. etc... your sub needs more general positive and helpful attitude, no matter how serious it is, just like sometimes serious, always enjoyable, friendly and positive. always willing to help a user that asks...

then why dont you tell him where to ask, not just say "dont ask me"
