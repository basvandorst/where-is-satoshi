Is the camera good enough to scan and the display good enough to show QR codes?

Yes. This makes so much sense. Much easier than these non-American prefixes that everyone else in the world uses. 
Also decimals are hard. The bit should be one twelfth of a bitcoin and we can further divide bits into one eights if necessary.

Yes, not only could you have duplicate information in the three pieces like multi-sig addresses so you only need two pieces to have the full qr code, qr codes can also have error correction which allows up to 30% of the qr code to be missing but still be readable.

Wait what? I've been sending people my blockchain wallet login and password to make purchases. Is there another way I don't know about?

Strange, the address in your screenshot is wrong. It should be 16Rtg663CKgggrzfJAABonSB4Li7gsoEic
You're welcome.

FYI bitcoin-qt isn't the best wallet out there for most users. For instance on electrum to see your private key all you have to do is right click on public address, click private key, enter password.
