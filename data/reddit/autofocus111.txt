That is a fine piece of work indeed. I'm curious why you didn't create a version with black text on white background. Was it less visually appealing?

Kalispell Montana was once home to a pioneering semiconductor fabrication equipment supplier that grew quite famous in the industry. The company was named Semitool, and at one time their  tools could be found in pretty much every wafer fab.

Dude, It's long-short ETFs that track BTC futures that are USD-settled. In what world is any of this 'better' for BTC? It's a WS loop around SEC rules so Wall Street thugs can profit off BTC price movements. It has NOTHING to do with BTC directly, and does NOTHING to benefit BTC directly. 
"By being long Bitcoin Futures Contracts, the Fund seeks to benefit from daily increases in the price of the Bitcoin Futures Contracts," according to the SEC filing. "The Fund will not be benchmarked to the current price of bitcoin and will not invest directly in bitcoin. When the price of Bitcoin Futures Contracts held by the Fund declines, the Fund will lose value."

Thanks. Good to know there's a fix.

Canada is among lowest cost electricity producers in the world, and Quebec has the lowest electricity prices in North America. In addition Quebec generates this electricity via hydro dams.

Back in the early 90's when I was a cash-strapped engineering student I asked my old man repeatedly to lend me a thousand bucks to buy shares in MSFT. He refused. Thanks for nothing old man.

So why did CBOE XBT futures start trading on Sunday 6PM?

Unreal. "BTC" ETFs based on cash-settled "BTC" futures. It's amazing what WS will try to get around SEC rules.

Santander launched an international FX payments system running on blockchain. Now HSBC developed a blochain app to run commodities trades. Meanwhile BTC developers are working on LN. Is LN more important than apps to compete for transactions in the two single largest markets - FX and commodities - that the big banks are focused on?

I don't trust ETH. I only will ever hold BTC and/or LTC.

I expect that as LTC adoption gains traction and the ecosystem grows, we will see a larger and more diverse set of participants at future roundtable meetings.

Would be nice to see third party like Intel or AMD or NVDA put out a BTC chip I guess.

That's certainly a way of determining the current FMV.  But the author of that article attempts to model what FMV will be if BTC displaces fiat in transactions or gold as a store of value. I persoanlly found it to be a  useful and insightful perspective, although I'm sure  this type of analysis has been presented before. She posts investing articles on SeekingAlpha which I also find  well-though out and informative.
A reasonable estimate where BTC accounts for 5% of GDP in transactions in a decade puts BTC value  in the range of $25-50K. I can live with that.

Apparently retail investors will be able to trade these futures too
“Bakkt is really designed for the institutional trader. So this is a futures contract. That said, we expect this futures contract to trade through retail brokerages as well, so retail customers can trade this contract.”

I found the last part of this statement quite interesting. It suggests that private blockchains could have a role to play in the space.
