I'm sorry for your story. That's horrible, let's hope bitcoin can save more lives.
Today Andreas tweeted "believe women". Yeah, right.

I am gonna try anyway. Thanks for the tips. I hodl 70% of my coins, and trade the rest. I know suffering awaits me on this road, but there is no stop now.
See you in the other side of the hyperbitcoinization river, my friend. Let's hope we're all alive and well when it gets there.

The more I am in this space, the more I feel Andreas is just seeking attention. He is always late for important position taking in this space politics, and when it's is not crypto, he seems to throw his critical thinking out of the window.
Great speeches tho

You two do know that nothing that you showed here really count as a measure of how much to trust someone, right? It doesn't matter if his interests align with Bitcoin holders, if his ideas are wrong and technical knowledge lacking. For god's sake, the man speaks like a common politician. The amount of falacies he speaks in one discussion is worrying at best.

It seems Roger is an Early adopter, which gives him potentially gazillion dollars now.
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:52:02
The difference is irrelevant. Roger might have the highest of causes, and the best of interests, if his reasoning is wrong, he is wrong.

Reduced usage will be a problem only if the equilibrium is a low usage point. If it is in a high usage point, as it is today, then it's not a problem. 
You're right for being concerned about it. There's a possibility that more people will stop using bitcoin than will want to use it, and this should throw the equilibrium down, which would cause the situation you described. I think that's the good part about sidechains, they introduce alternative ways of using bitcoin, for people not willing to go directly to the blockchain, but also create fees for miners when they settle. Two birds, one stone. Let's see how these things interact together.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:53:33
If people don't use bitcoin, fees are gonna go down. These two forces should find an equilibrium.

You still have to pay fees. A payment channel is opened between two people, but as these channels are opened more and more by more people, a network of channels is born. Your wallet can navigate through this network of channels and pay someone that isn't directly connected to you, in that way you don't need to open a lighting channel with everyone you need to make a payment, but it can be costly due to fees along the way, so your wallet looks for the path of least fees. This means that as more and more people use lightning channel, the network increases and the fees go down due to more available paths.

It's not conditioning, it's people in general and their animal self. I will go as far as to say that this is their/our primary response, and critical thinking acts only on a small number thoughts. Don't expect fake news, shaming tactics, trolling, shitposting, character assassination, etc, go away any time soon. Quite sad, I have to add, but it's just too human.

If you really knew your maths, you would know that dynamical systems with many variables have a particular state where the minimal variation on the initial settings cause a massive exponential change in the time evolution of the system. Every small bit people do might count.

Multiple. And the channel is opened for a set period of time, during which money can be sent back and forth multiple times. It expands the idea of bitcoin more than it changes it.

There was research on it, and people still treat the "spam" explanation as conspiracy theory. Man, politics ruins everything.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:43:00
You don't need to open a new channel for a new payment. If you have an old channel open, you can use it to access the network and pay for the coffee navigating through other people's channels. If you needed to open one channel everytime you wanted to smoke a cigarette it certainly would be a dump technology. But remember, the name is "lightinig Network" not "lightning channel".

Litecoin is a grandson coin of Satoshi, isn't it?

Shame is sometimes stronger than reasonable arguments. Having a rational logical thinking is hard, time consuming and demands concentration and energy; many people can't even do it, specially if they lack the complete information about what they are thinking. That's why people use shame and jokes to change other people's minds. You can argue it is ugly and messy, even unsophisticated, but is effective.

It's not a good idea to use such simplistic dichotomies to explain complex events. But in this case, I agree with you.

Lightning creates near instantaneous payment channels that need to submit to the mainchain only once in the end. It takes away pressure from onchain scaling with the sidechain scaling, which will help bitcoin market value and reach. Also, many other forms of sidechains and payment channels are possible and will do the same or even more to help bitcoin scaling. Some sidechains already exist in a clumsy and centralized form, but the transaction malleability bug needs to be fixed in order for lightning and other sidechains to work efficiently. The name of the proposal to fix the transaction malleability bug is "segregated witness", a fix that is currently being blocked for weak and political reasons.

Nah, that's not the case. It's just that BU was always an irrelevant topic, and the moderators of this forum got it earlier.

Don't make jokes, because jokes be stupid or something. I don't know, but there are a lot of killjoys on the internet.

Bitcoin was supposed to work despite everyone being a selfish motherfucker. I have been reading a lot of people asking for politeness and conversation, compromises and for miners to think of users, for devs to think of miners, and other nonsensical stuff. If bitcoin needs this to go forward, it means it has failed.
From what I understand, miners have been becoming centralized for quite some time, and the age of ASICs is showing things are heading for the worst. If mining gets too centralized, it could make a few miners able to impose their will over bitcoin, i.e., their selfiness would make everyone else's life shitty. Not only that, bigger blocks could make nodes more centralized as well. 
My take is that Core is trying to fight it by making sidechains easier to implement, this way miners would get less powerful. There seems to be indeed a "war" going on Bitcoin, devs vs. miners, and my take is that miners (the current job, not the persons) have got to go. Miners are indeed the problem.

This stance is devoid of humanity. We humans mock that which we think is dumb. Construct you moral laws over behavior that isn't human, and all you see is immoral people around you. Making jokes and shaming that which we think and rationally show is bad is not an inconsistent stance.
