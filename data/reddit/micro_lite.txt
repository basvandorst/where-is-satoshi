If you borrow against it, and bitcoin goes to 0, you're stuck owing $22k. If you borrow $17k (or the approximate after-tax value) and lose it, you'll have to pull the whole $22k out anyway.
Even if bitcoin does well, you're going to have to slowly pay back the 22k out of your paychecks.
I'm not really sure how this is an advantage.

@_date: 2012-08-05 16:49:18
In order for there to be wide spread adoption, there will have to be a significant increase in the "market cap" of bitcoin (one of several issues right now).  At $100,000,000 right now, there is not sufficient liquidity for many significant players to be able to consider it.  As the USD value of BTC increases it will help alleviate this concern.

To me it really only seems like steps 3,5 and 7 are relevant.  Bitcoin is far from a "developed" economy like that of Second Life (step 4), and obviously the fundamental issue of regulation is irrelevant (1,2 and 6).  I think the analogy is off, but it is definitely an interesting case study.
We also have seen with the financial crisis that even with heavy regulation massive ponzi-schemes still occur.  It will be interesting to see what self-regulation will occur within the community... are entities going to step up and "certify" bitcoin banks security?  Will people realize some investments are too good to be true?

"What is a good motherboard (quality vs. price) that can fit four dual-slot graphics cards without risers or spacers or anything that can be bought easily online?"
If you run them without risers, you're going to overheat the card since there is not enough space between them for proper airflow.  
One of the best for large rigs:
"How would I go across powering the cards? I assume multiple PSUs are a must but I don't know what kind of watt rating to buy, how many, or how to set it up. Is there a way to power the cards directly without using the motherboard, and if so, what do I need to buy for it and how would I make it work?"
If you use multiple PSUs (which you will need) you can put a paperclip from the green wire in the motherboard connection (the ground) to one of the black cables and it will stay powered on.

There's 2 components to an option a "strike" price, and an expiration date.
There's 2 types of options: Call (buy) and Put (sell)
With a "Call" option, you have the "option" to buy 1 bitcoin at the strike price at the given date.  (Ex: the 1.0 September Call option).  When you buy the option, there is a person on the other end of the deal that is required to sell you 1 bitcoin at the agreed upon price at the agreed upon time.
A "Put" option is the opposite, you're agreeing to sell 1 bitcoin at a price/time to somone that is agreeing to buy it.

Why would they need dark pools to do that? They could just keep buying back and forth from one hand to another on the market without the dark pool.
Dark pools allow people to unload large volumes without creating dramatic volatility.  If you think its BTC-USD is volatile now, imagine orders of 100k+ being pushed through on the open market and the panic that would ensue.

"Outperform" is not saying 100x growth for BTC, its saying 100x more than the growth for gold, silver and the market.  If gold increases 1% over 2 years, BTC has to increase 100% to match it (or $11 -&gt; $22).  If gold doubles (100% increase), BTC must go up by 10,000% (to the $1,100 mark).

I took the shares contributed for each user from the latest block on BTC Guild, and graphed the percentiles.  The top 10% consists of people getting over 1.35 GHash/sec, and contribute 51% of the total work.

I really think its best in the long that BTC early adopters cash out sooner rather than later (in a measured, deliberate manner... not in a panic).  It is stronger in the hands of people that have put money down to buy it, or invested in systems to mine it later in the game.  They will be less prone to frantic moves because they have more more to lose.

Right before BTC Guild went down they banned a huge botnet network. Its clearly retaliatory, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were doing it largely out of spite.  It does seem that the Hash rate right now is about 1-1.5 TeraHash less than its been over the last week though so it looks like its having some effect.  I'm not sure however whether that's from banning the botnet, or taking major pools down.

I dont think that $3.2M will have any significant effect, since the average daily volume has averaged around $3M since the beginning of march.
However, it is very likely that a larger fund would be quietly adding bitcoin to their portfolio.  Since the fund in the article is so small, most likely they are advertising to raise awareness of their products.

Assuming that's true (which I disagree with).... the company is taking all the risk here.  If it goes up, the customers proceed with the transaction as normal.  If it goes down, then people reverse the transaction to buy at a lower price and the company is left holding the bag.

It's not a faster ROI if you're paying proportionally more. 1 GH at $100 has the same ROI as 10 GH at $1,000.

Pretty accurate. Since we're near the end of a difficulty period it won't be doubled but somewhere in the middle. It takes the average time to find a block over the 2016 block period to adjust for the next 2016 blocks.

I think within the next few years, there will be a solution to this that is significantly cheaper than CC fees. There is a lot more efficiency in processing bitcoin transactions than traditional banking, so even with some sort of "security fee" bitcoin will still be significantly cheaper to use.

The valuation right now is basically factoring in the probability of bitcoin achieving it's full potential. To be a usable currency it really needs to be &gt; $10,000.  The market is giving it ~1% chance of achieving that at current rates - mostly i'm guessing to technology concerns (being too hard to get and use for the average person) and legislative concerns.

Except that all of the problems you stated are for companies, while all of the benefits are for consumers. For every 1 BFL there's a significantly larger proportion of companies that are legitimate, pay significant fees, and get their accounts frozen for no reason.
You're paying fees for PayPal to serve as an escrow service. If that is the major concern there are ways to do that within bitcoin for significantly cheaper. For most established and legitimate companies this is not needed, and will reduce the transaction cost by 3%+ which can be significant in a low margin environment.

It's not insurance, it's a contract. Two parties, a buyer and a seller must agree on a future value of the contract.  Eventually the market will come to equilibrium at a "fair value" for what network difficulty will be X months into the future. If the contract underestimates difficulty the value of the contract will rise and if it underestimates difficulty it will lower.
@_date: 2013-09-14 15:15:07
The difficulty has been going up 50% per month, so in 90 days the expected wait time will be 360 days, not to mention the huge variability in solo mining that could easily double wait times.

The contracts will be priced at whatever the projected difficulty is in the future. The gain/loss is based on how far off that projection is from difficulty at expiration.

Not completely... the fees used to be denominated in BTC and did not fluctuate with the exchange rate. This was fine in 2012, but after the large increase this year was not viable. Basically take the current rate in BTC and multiply by 10x to see approximately what they were charging in BTC before this was fixed.
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:26:16
It's used because of the network effect... the same reason that other cryptocurrencies haven't caught on as much as bitcoin.  Having more users provides advantages that outweigh the increased capabilities of trading at other exchanges. Trading at the larger exchange has tighter spreads (the difference between buy and sell orders) as well as more depth (being able to buy and sell more at one time).
Also, mtgox has a variable fee schedule, that decreases the more you trade.... down to 0.25%.
I think your daily profit number is probably a lot higher than they're really making.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:54:53

Yea.. I'm really lost. A $40 bet would pay off $90 if bitcoin goes to 500 or $0 if it ends the year less than 500? Why would anyone do that if they could buy $40 worth of bitcoin and make over $200, not to mention that most likely if it doesn't reach $500 it will have a value &gt; 0.
On the other hand, the 9/1 bet that btc will be &lt;$100 is a good hedge for a btc speculator.

Yup, most likely its more efficient to mine on your own, although GPUs will become increasingly border-line.  The main advantage of these companies is the planned increase in hashing power as the difficulty increases.
It's really just another option to consider if you're trying to get into mining... I'm not sure how strongly I feel either way.

Successful businesses will dominate this type of metric as they attract customers. This study makes it appear that this is all individuals collecting an increasing amount of bitcoins with their "rich get richeer" - it doesn't show what's really happening for these addresses to acquire bitcoins. Obviously companies like BitPay and Coinbase that are growing significantly every day are going to attract more connections, even though they are really holding other people's money.

This is probably a technical move from traders - see 
@_date: 2013-08-01 17:05:09
In a simplified contract where 1 million in difficulty = 1BTC...
Say the going rate for a Sept future is 40 million, so buyers are willing to pay 40 btc for the contract, and sellers are willing to accept 40 btc for the contract.
When the contract expires in september the value of the contract is assessed based on the current difficulty level. If the difficulty is 45 million, the buyer receives 45 btc (a net gain of 5 btc), and the seller pays 45 btc.
An additional benefit to this is that it also provides a fair assessment of where projected difficulty will be, since people are putting their money on the line with these contracts.
Edit: to address your edit, it is the responsibility of the exchange to make sure that sellers of contracts have enough funding in their accounts to cover them until expiration. If the difficulty were to increase that dramatically, there is a real risk that whatever margin was reserved for the contract will not be enough to cover it. A sophisticated exchange will force sellers of the contracts to liquidate and balance out their account buy buying contracts on the open market.

The thing is that credit card companies are effectively forcing you to purchase insurance on all of your transactions by forcing fees on to merchants.

Unfortunately, it seems like many of bitcoins advantages are for companies, and not the consumers. IMO the onus is on these companies to pass on some of the cost savings to consumers.  It is not really fair that they have lower fees, and lower risk using bitcoin but still charge the same rates as paypal transactions.
As a rational consumer - and not a bitcoin evangelist - there is a very small incentive to use bitcoin... where I have to convert USD through exchanges, and can't charge-back if there is an issue with a product.  It will be challenging to achieve btc adoption from customers until we see companies share their advantages.

"User creates a split (2-of-2 multisig) wallet on the computer and server."

IIRC someone proposed a similar idea last year, where a company could issue stock using bitcoin's system:
You can track the origin of a single bitcoin, which would represent 100% of the company.  This could be divided and allocated to share-holders (or in this instance survey takers). Shareholders could then vote by signing the action with their private key, and the weight of the vote is proportional to the % of the original bitcoin they hold.
