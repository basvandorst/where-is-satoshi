I think you're misreading the European method of writing large numbers $100.000,00 = $100,000.00

Daily discussion threads here have a habit of not being created or left unstickied when the market takes a dump.

I don't get how this report - audit or not - confirms *anything*. The law firm put in enough disclaimers separating themselves from their own report:










@_date: 2018-06-10 17:37:52
longer the market keeps up like this, the earlier you had to have been in to see green. more and more people getting pushed out
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:13:21
can't both be true? currently "dead" with low transaction volume because the system was tested with high transaction volume at the beginning of the year and couldn't perform?

Proof of reserves? They have a disclaimer saying that they can't guarantee the accuracy of the information Tether gave them:


@_date: 2018-06-20 14:19:00
Headline: Tether Audit - 100% Backed
Article: By the way, this isn’t an audit. 
"The above confirmation of bank and	tether balances should not be construed	 as the	 results of an audit and were not conducted in	accordance	with Generally Accepted	Auditing Standards."

The market dropped over 60% in around three months. thats the very definition of a crash lol
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:57:55
Yeah I don’t get how people are seeing this as a good thing. One person was able to absolutely tank the price 75% all by themselves. This just shows that if you have enough cash, one person can completely manipulate the market for their own benefit. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:27:00
Honestly this place looks like a bunch of people that YouTubed economics 101 and 102 and now think they know all the ins and outs of financial markets and monetary policy. Not to mention how completely unrealistic a lot of expectations here are.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:55:25
That’s what people said when it dropped to 6k. “Don’t worry, massive 10k buy wall” only for the wall to evaporate as the price shot right through it. Rinse and repeat all the way down to the bottom. It obviously did rebound, but the $Xk buy walls were all fake. They call this spoofing when it comes to other investments and is highly illegal in those markets.

Lol? Taking out a loan to pay taxes so you don't have to sell some of your coins is functionally equivalent to taking a loan out to buy coins. It's the same thing as tuning a coin into fiat, paying your tax bill, then taking out a loan and buying that much in coins again (ignoring exchange fees). You're still banking on the fact that the coins you have will go up to cover the loan you just took out.

People still do. Compare bitcoin trends against a similar thing that people should already know about, say the dollar, and you'll see the search volume is more or less consistent.

Do you not get how percentages work? 2% fee replenishing on every purchase is the exact same as a 2% fee when you replenish monthly (or yearly or weekly). 2% is 2%

Hillary lost. Bernie lost. The GOP controls the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch. How on earth are the liberals behind a state conspiracy to take your bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:05:09
No, I'm familiar with that. But that doesn't answer my question. If the currency is so worthless that people are eating cucumbers for dinner, who is going to take that worthless currency and give them bitcoins? Say there is an entity that will take their currency and give them crypto, how is that going to solve their problems? They'll receive an equivalent amount of crypto for their currency, but since their currency is all but worthless, they won't get much. How does that help anything?
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:48:52
This is terrible design. Without the paper, how are people supposed to know what that machine does. All I see is "COINFLIP" printed all over with a tiny screen, and in tiny letters on the bottom right a description of what the machine actually does.
The printed paper taped to the front just makes it embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:19:51
lol that's their buisness. buy from you below market rate, sell to you above market rate, and charge a nice percentage fee on top of all that.

how are those people going to get bitcoin, though? who is going to take their worthless money and convert it to bitcoins for them (and at what rate)?
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:27:57
Or negative benefit, as you lose the spending/fraud protections that cards provide in addition to paying an extra 2% for your trouble.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:36:19
You can use first-in-first-out or first-in-last-out, I believe. The important thing to keep in mind is that whichever system you use, you need to be consistent with. You can't use FIFO on 4/9 to mark as a capital loss and then on 5/9 use FILO and again mark a loss.

where did this "nazi collaborator" nonsense come from? Soros was aged 9-14 during that time period and pretended to be Christian in order to avoid being killed

it's one of the reasons we don't have a national ID in the US if I remember correctly (and why we're stuck on the broken Social Security number system)
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:19:03
They absolutely do, but it’s not like they reduce the price if you buy with crypto or cash. You’re paying an extra 2% on top of the inflated price the merchant sets for the “convenience” of spending crypto.

Hardly any movement in the last six days? Maybe if you're ignoring the $1000 spike in less than a minute six days ago, the $300 spike in less than a minute five days ago, the $300 drop in less than a minute half a day later, the $300 spike in less than a minute three days ago followed by a $300 drop a few hours later, the $200 drop in less than a minute yesterday, the $200 spike in less than a minute this morning, and the $200 drop in less than a minute about an hour ago.
