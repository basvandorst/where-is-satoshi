Interviewee, unless he's roasting you.

Doesn't Capital One ban crypto related payments? Don't think they should be receiving recommendation here.

What happened to 2010/11?

Supporting what "works now" is like investing in a company based on this month's balance sheet, i.e. dumb.
Also, while Bitcoin may not work for the poor at present, it works just fine for the rich, and like it or not, the latter group is the one that matters.

How does one go about getting wives? I've looked at CMC and I cant see it listed anywhere.

You are missing the conditional clause "if you are a fucking dipshit" at the end of that sentence.

I'm surprised you don't think your own existence is a lie. Maybe it's a creation of a TLA? Got any proof solipsism of the present moment is false?

I don't really get why opposing UASF makes you renege on SW and support BU.

Damn, how can you have so few if you got in in 2011? And he *lost* money in 2013, wtf?

Dost thou livest with thine head in the sand (regarding archaic grammar)?

Indeed. The lack of perspective never ceases to amaze me. If it's not plane crashes, train wrecks or the Challenger shuttle, it's Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen that are used as an analogy to price.

lol snap. They got me as well, though my problem is more that they bloated up the transaction to over 1KB, so my fee's like 30-40 sats/byte.

Oddly, my Bitcoin hasn't produced this effect in women. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 17:58:18
Oh yeah, it's impossible for me to buy Bitcoin when I'm in some foreign country, and when I'm scared of trading over the counter, and when I've got no arms and legs etc...
@_date: 2016-12-16 11:45:58
lol, always the way.
@_date: 2016-12-11 23:27:56
I'm not seeing much of a plan B here. Enlighten me otherwise.

Gold isn't valuable because it's used in jewellery; jewellery is valuable because it uses gold.

This could be my new fav Youtube video. Great job, well done!

It was not dominant until the end - its weekly volume 25th Nov at the peak was 264K BTC. Stamp was 216K, BTC-e 209K and BTCC was 460K (and they were still charging trading fees then).
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:53:38
That raised my eyebrow too.

An invite only event isn't exactly a great foundation for a democratic future.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:57:41
lol, awesome :p
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:21:42
The author is probably referring to how blockchains can make voting more transparent, or maybe disintermediation, rather than distribution of the currency.
I'm merely highlighting an irony in the article - you can't laud more democratic, people-empowering futures while holding a Bilderberg-esque conference.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:38:44
Perfect. Going to have to save this one!
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:50:27
It wasn't just the last days you didn't handle well. Do you think it was a wise move to have accepted and concealed the bitcoin liability you inherited from Jed from day one?
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:46:39
Damn, the education system is really saving on paper. Back in my day we had whole sheets of A4 you know.
