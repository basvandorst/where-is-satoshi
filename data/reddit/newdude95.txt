Just a wild guess.
Im not 100% but I think I've read that number estimated somewhere.

Do I need to have my coin in the Coinbase portfolio or can i keep them on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:26:26
Yep, just get the errorpage.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:40:51

@_date: 2017-11-30 01:16:01

If you using Gdax, once entered your wanted price, hit you money up on the balance and it will buy for that amount.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:17:41
I do this. I keep 80% in a wallet and use the rest for daytrading on Gdax.
I've made some gains, also some losses. But I think it's fun thats why I do it.
Be careful and try to read the asking prices.

Fuck was just about to sell and wait to buy back during a dip :(

Try calling your bank.
Here in sweden I had to call my bank up and give them some more info of me, the country that the accepting company (coinbase) was in (IBAN number).
Why I was sending money to other countrys and how much this time and an estimate how how much per year.
Try calling the bank again.

Don't know..

Can you recommend another site to trade during the "forking thing"? (noob, less then a week in the game)
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:44:45
I knew there was no fee from gdax to coinbase, same company :p
Just assumed they would charge you for for doing a bank transfer like they do when you buy bitcoins directly from coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:24:14
You need to sign up for a site that allows "fiat" currency (USD/EUR etc) to be deposited. I use started using Coinbase. Then you can buy bitcoin with the money you have on your Coinbase account, either keep them there, send them to a wallet, phone or pc, hardware or paper. Or send them to a place you can trade/buy/sell. Im using Coinbases system GDAX.com. From there you can sell and buy both with coins or with fiat currency that you deposited.
I started less then a week ago, (been interested for years) and found some Youtube videos in my language, he used Coinbase and that made it easy for me to just follow and learn from there.
I use Blockchain as a wallet in my phone and keep some there and some on Coinbase and GDAX.com for daily trading.
If this is good sites or wallets i don't know. I've heard good about Electrum as a wallet too.
If am wrong someone please correct me :)

You have to pay a fee when transferring money to coinbase don't you?
Or when you do a fiat deposit from your bank account it's just a normal transfer that nobody charge extra for?
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:46:02
how would bitcoin value change? good or bad?
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:20:02
Im in Sweden using coinbase and gdax. Currency on coinbase shows in kronor (Swedish) but on gdax I trade with BTC/EUR. I can then transfer it back to coinbase and it shows in Swedish kronor again.
So yeah it should work for you.
