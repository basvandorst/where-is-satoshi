This is interesting...can you elaborate.
@_date: 2014-01-01 20:15:35
Yeah, that sounds like an architectural problem for not having a midway entry point where one gets scanned.

Where can one find recent publications like the one you mentioned that will eventually become disruptive technology? How did you came across that paper? Are you subscribed to anything?
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:13:58
Let me tell you how it went. I met this guy here on reddit, bought off .22BTC through paypall for a VPN server @ $500. Then I saw that it dipped to $770. Turned bear after seeing bttchina dipping as well. So I then sold .031BTC @ $818.71 for $24.98 and sold .10042 BTC for $80.73 @ $813.58.  I have .08939404 left and I am now a bull again. I can now say I sort of broke even. 
TL;DR: I don't think the crash bears were predicting will come anytime soon so yes it sucks.

Edit: I also believe &gt;a subreddit devoted to speculation about the future through discussions, images, videos, art, gifs, and tedtalks about technology, civilization, foresight, futurology, futurism, existential risk reduction, space colonization, A.I., the future of humanity, the Singularity, Transhumanism and accelerating change.

There aren't any small minded people here on or anyone imposing ideologies,  the side bar is just pointing out the ideologies that are definitely behind a non-government regulated Bitcoin


I'll be happy if a mod adds:

I'll give you some examples on why I say choose sides, and that the people that want to do good, I believe, are the people that want to extend automation so that we can focus on core issues, the passion of life, and advancement:
- Drone based delivery system with a p2p regulation standards
- Solar and wind mill p2p communities with a p2p regulation standards
- Self driving cars with a p2p regulation standards
- Seasteading and Charter Cities in a non environmental and human hard p2p way of functioning 
- Flying transformers and personal helicopters with a p2p regulation standards
- Personal submarines with p2p regulation standards
- Sharing of private possessions with p2p regulation standards
- Open hardware and 3d printing with p2p regulation standards
- Fiber Internet with true net neutrality
This list can go on. The reality is that we are always being stopped by legal hurdles and lobbying by the people who currently hold power. If I want to challenge a local bank, electric company, tv company, even a hospital, it'll be stopped. Stopping someone from advancing your field is too harmful for human evolution. In the future people won't allow that.

I'll definitely make sure to read them. Do we have a list of books that explains stuff like this that is related to Bitcoin?

This is like posting to a thread where everyone says they have a 2014 Ferrari and saying I have a 1998 Chevy Cavalier (which I don't have) but: I do have .22 BTC that I purchased at $500. Back in January I didn't have the disposable income to invest.

Those people will have to realize the privatization movement of government services. Sooner or later, most likely California or Puerto Rico, will have to allow public service taxation to be optional. I shouldn't be hold liable for your children's education.
If you want to fund public schools because they can't compete that's an ideology you're enforcing among me that will cease eventually thanks to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:57:18
Honestly, the network effect and accelerating return are new. Personally, I have a lot of saved reddit articles and comments like these and then transfer I them to my [Bitcoin Evernote Notebook](  Luckily this has been paying off because I have yet another essay to do and I'm doing it with these resources.

This is what happens when we try to appeal to the demographic of small minded people. Only small minded people will dismiss a proposal or solution because of the ideological source behind it.

If that's the case, a mod should tell should link back to us. If or stay or not its not a huge deal but the end conclusion of this thread is that more related subreddits should be added. I assume you're not going to create another thread asking for more votes on what to add on the sidebar- this thread is good enough. 
My votes go to the ones I mentioned on my main thread.
Which were:

I figured out about Bitcoins in January, and they were around $30 and didn't invest until it was $500. What I'm saying is you can't honestly believe that this doesn't look like April and should take precaution.

I have a  lot of questions:
Do you guys have a timeline, for historical reference, of the time you started advertising Bitcoin, going to (location), (location), (tv air time), (people [positions]), etc?
What was the Bitcion merchant adoption rate for the last 3 years? 
What is being sold?

Currently, a local private company doesn't provide unsubsidized Internet or a local market provides unsubsidized food. I don't seek to prove Bitcoin shares the ideology of distributism. It proves it itself.

Well, I transferred all my [70 bookmarks from Evernote  into a list.ly list]( to allow collaboration. I plan to make a post but before I do I was wondering, if you have any links similar to Butterflylabs, coinbase, bitpay, bitcoinstarter, things like that, or anything. Do you really have a list of 300 bitcoin websites?

There has to be merit based communities where you're at. No. Through distributism, merit becomes power. Commodities will always trump currency. I can't do anything about unethical OPM gathering without being witch hunted but the people currently with the power aren't we, the people anymore. "Life begins at incorporation." I see private syndicates, fractional owning and financing, crowdfunding, collaborative consumption, the sharing economy whatever you want to call it as the new people's power. Do you agree that with legal hurdles this will essentially slow down human advancement?
There are people that want to monitor economic disruption and those who don't. Which side are you on?
@_date: 2013-07-22 00:26:41

I'm assuming 'by that' you mean public services. I shouldn't have to answer that. Your entitlement to great public services relies on how effectively the controller manages it's capital. I don't have to build public services or maintain them other than what I use. This position will lead to questioning the use of roads and in all honesty you'll have to argue with someone else.

My view is that if for any reason a scenario like Cyprus happens people would "transfer" out of USD and into companies that accept BTC / CNY / etc. For example doesn't the USD lose its value when a group of people purchase hosting services outside of the country? The money is now circulating in another economy. Thus I called it a transfer of wealth. I'm wrong though there must be a correct term for this.
