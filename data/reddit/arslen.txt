Maybe on 2.0, not on the first Silkroad. You could in the beginning but they stopped with that.

nope, nothing yet. I think there's something wrong with the exchange I'm using. Seems more people are having similar problems.

I've done the same with about 10 bitcoins. Bought them back when they were worth about 150$ Still have them.

In Sweden the quickest way is to use Kapiton.se, no ID-verification is required and things Work smoothly. Fot some resdon you can't send SEK to them this week (11/11 - 18/18). I don't know why.

The crisis in Europe (Cyprus) and the ddos of Mt.gox are two big factors, I'm not sure about the details though.

I didn't see any notion of any fee except for the exchange site's 0.005 BTC. Just after I transferred the bigger amount i tried to verify my email for the Blockchain wallet, it failed however for some reason. Can that have anything to do with it?
