I covertly think this is the case, Bitcoin comes at a time when the dollar is on the brink of collapse and the way the american main stream media seem to push Bitcoin seems that there was a command from the higher up to make this happen.

The concept of a cryptocurrency wasn't a new one, it had been described by many science fiction writers before (Cryptonomon for example). Satoshi solved the hardest bit with the Two General's Problem which applied to the doublespend concern. I'd posit that because the TCP/IP stack and multiple branches of cryptography had been fully designed Satoshi just had to make use of the underlying technologies to apply his technique. The short answer is that Satoshi was smart enough to make it all work without having to open his code up to others until it was fully functional and he didn't need any help.

You really fail at arguing, but anyway:


If you are saying that there are different types of cryptocurrency, yes there are but there are none that are better than Bitcoin, and Bitcoin can also be adapted to include improvements, as shown by recent events.


Market capitalization volume speaks for itself. You may have a niche application of a certain cryptocurrency, but it will remain small. 


This is egregiously incorrect, the more network effect is in force the less chance is has from being disrupted. BTC is a protocol, not a brand, it can be changed and improved as needed while retaining value.


You don't back up anything here, the burden of proof is on you. Distribution is a mute point and left for an exercise for the reader because you can't bootstrap a global currency and dole it out in proportions that you think is fair depending on who had the money previously.


Nothing has to be *justified*, who cares about your moralistic dilemma. There are bigger *injustices* in the world.


That isn't a reason why it won't become a world reserve currency, it's a reason why you think it shouldn't.

When you increase efficiencies to existing systems these benefits can be passed on to others. For example, Bitcoin allows for microtransactions, something which was not possible before, so it opens the doors for new developers to create businesses and hence a livelihood from that. 
If you reduce the cost of global remitance from 10% to 1% the users can benefit by having more free time or disposable income, while this isn't strictly wealth creation, it's allowing them to do more with the same amount of money.

This is why the current price stability is misleading- we've never had so many people buying bitcoin for daily purchases and we've also never had as many merchants using it but hedging against losses by cashing out to fiat, this forces bitpay to sell their coins lowering price.

The sub-narrative is saying "Bitcoin is now a part of the current financial system, get along with the program". People who reject Bitcoin when they are bombarded with "Bitcoin is great" speeches will now be taken by surprise that Bitcoin is now already part of the system and being treated as such.

Exactly, we took a huge gamble putting personal money (that was ALREADY taxed through personal income tax) into bitcoin in the early days. If I sell my coins to buy something the taxman wants 33% of the earnings, for what? Doing nothing. I'm not against paying taxes but 33% is just ridiculous. I'm not beyond the point of leaving for a few years and declaring it as income earned in another country just so that I don't hand any money over to those crooks.

Old timer here. I've sat through a hard fork and a few crashes. Every big event causes you to worry less and less, for example Bitcoin was a small niche topic to start with and now its discussed on world stage economic forums. Give it a few years. I'm nearly sure there are paid trolls on this sub trying to depress the market price but as soon as their handlers have bought enough cheap coins that will change. I still retain the optimism that I first had when I read and more importantly understood what satoshi's original white paper stood for.
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:21:33
On the final question when people raise the point that there could be a successor to bitcoin I have the following rebuttal- 
We saw that recently Auoracoin was hard forked within a few hours of it's launch and trashed, this shows that people are dedicating hardware resources to prevent competitors from detracting from Bitcoin, any competitor would have to have a significantly different design philosophy and radical benefits from bitcoin for it to gain an escape velocity which would let it succeed. It's not just about releasing a new coin anymore, you need significant mining power to back it up until it's accepted. This is why bitcoin may be more virulent and self perpetuating than TCP/IP (which it is what its often compared to) because bitcoin proponents are able to actively attack and destroy competitors from taking hold. This is why Bitcoin will be around for a very long time to come.

This would be a hard fork and the result would not be bitcoin, any change to the protocol would not be accepted by the current users and they wouldn't use it, why would they. I could do this now with the current blockchain but no one would adopt it. It's the network effect in action.


They can ban bank transactions all they like but no one can stop someone meeting on localbitcoins.com and changing a load of cash for bitcoin. They can't stop the protocol without damaging the internet globally and even then it would be next to impossible.

Project Ara is a flash in the pan. It's a great idea in theory but I wish people would shut up about it. Who here is honestly going to buy it? I know i'm not because the phone I have is an integrated design package. It's internal layout has been optimised for it's use case. It doesn't have three separate battery sections with reinforced structural stability protection, it has one big battery. If I need a flashlight I use the integrated flash that the camera uses, its *good enough*. I dont want an entire part of my phone devoted to being an "LED flashlight section". All of the other attachments are NOVEL but not PRACTICAL. No one is going to keep their phone for more than 4 years or periodically swap out their CPU for a new version.
This concept is not going to be adopted by any manufacturer apart from those that Google forces with big cheques. Google has the money to throw at any project that remotely sounds interesting but I'll stake my reputation as someone who has been keeping a close eye on industrial design for all my career that the only people that will buy this are "feel gooders" and hopeful developers. It will be heralded as a new paradigm which will write a lot of column inches for click bait articles but it won't sell many units and in five years it wont exist.

Security compliance is the only thing I would be in favour of when all these people are taking about "Bitcoin Regulation" PCI compliance is an industry standard and companies holding wallets of a certain number should be held accountable for security breaches if it's not the users fault, and also should be making 2FA a default.

All the things are you mention are problems with Bitcoin in its current expression, but won't be an issue when the correct merchant infastructure is built and the sufficient amount of liquidity is available in the bitcoin market place.

It's not a problem, but not for the reason you describe. Fiat has always been printed out of existence through dilution throughout all of history because governments were able to create more on a whim. 
They told us this was necessary to encourage spending to avoid depression but in reality they just wanted free money, otherwise they could have given it to the population when they created it instead of the bankers.
Bitcoin is a revolution because it allows for all the benefits of a currency with the artificial limitation (similar to semi precious metal, which are not great as a currency). It combines the best aspects of these two financial instruments along with other attributes such as international transactions, no fees and is not turned off when the banks close their doors at 5pm.

They have ways to determine if money that you made in a year is capital gains or taxable personal income, if you are a day trader for example all gains you realise are personal income gains and taxed accordingly even though they may be from investments.

You could argue that the Bitcoin protocol has certain intrinsic values in that it's the biggest peer to peer decentralised trustless system which facilitates international transfer of money, but to say a Bitcoin on its own has an intrinsic value (linked to a monetary value or not) is meaningless. For example if it had an intrinsic value, you wouldn't have been able to sell a pizza for 1000 of them two years ago and now sell a pizza for .25 of a coin. The value is all perceived and perception is all subjective. For example a million Argentinian pesos has no intrinsic value for me because 1. I don't know in what context they are valuable and 2. There is relatively few things that I could do if I had them.

Price is largely decoupled by news over the past while because once the protocol is intact, most people believe in its future potential.

You need miners to confirm transactions on the network for a crytocurrency, if you have a lot of hardware power you can join as a miner and launch a 51% attack where you take over the transactions and create multiple spends or other nasty stuff. In the case of Auroracoin, the minors that joined the network didn't think that continuing their blockchain was worthwhile so they did this. If you have enough power to gain 51% of the Bitcoin mining rate (which would be a tremendous undertaking in itself) there would be more to gain in continuing the mining and leaving the blockchain intact because of the rewards that you'd get for mining.

It's better for humanity, it shifts power away from the banking cartels and government systems that defraud the population through money printing. They wage meaningless wars to profit on tax payers money. This may sound like wishy washy stuff but it's not.
It allows the unbanked (billions of people in the third world) to control their wealth personally.
It creates new forms of payments that have never been able to be done before such a third party payments without risk and also opens up the realm of micropayments which were previously impossible.
You want it to be anonymous so you can pay whoever you like without anyone knowing, if it's my business what I buy then no one has a right to know who I sent money to. Bitcoin allows that when you take appropriate protection.
It's a good store of value against inflation.

I don't think it could, one of the attributes during the early days of a bootstrapped digital currency is volatility.

I have this belief too. If you saw the possibility and inevitability of crytocurrency coming you would probably move first so that at least the one that takes hold is your own. Also if hyperinflation happens and bitcoin becomes a global currency they already own 1/21 of all the coins. The project execution and the way the coins have never moved seem to be the product of a small coding team in a very powerful organisation.

I really wouldn't worry, it's to be expected. There have been periods over a year of stagnation before.

As further uptake increase they eventually realise that they can conduct b2b transactions, within a few months of this happening I think we'll see an ATH again.

You are forgetting that your government continuously prints money at a far faster rate that your interest will ever amount to. The spending power of your 5 dollars reduces by 1%-3% annually. Bitcoin is slightly different in that it reduces at a much lower rate and if it has a higher uptake will increase in value which makes saving your money beneficial, something that your grandparents era would have recommended.

I really really doubt this. Google make sheds of money in their core competency market. They have enough money to buy out every bitcoin enterprise currently in operation many times over.

It's a typical reaction from someone who knows a little, and not a lot about bitcoin. "Journalists" keep having these "thinking out loud" moments, everything in his article can be refuted with facts. His analysis is not accurate and if you hang out around here for long enough you will find out why.

If the US outlawed it the price would take a hit to rates seen a few months ago but the Bitcoin protocol would, in the long term, largely remain unphased. Entrepreneurs would move to more bitcoin friendly countries.

I agree that some people have very short memories and even shorter long term visions. We've given the media their talking points for the next few days. That pessimistic person in work who knows a little bit about bitcoin will be able to tell you "he told you so". The truth is that the blockchain probably didn't see any more significant volume increase, this was all localised to MtGox. We'll build better infrastructure and services. Bitcoin's day in the sun is yet to come.

The thing about bitcoin is it's a cleverly disguised set of concepts that lures you in with the promise of free money (hey who doesn't want free money) but it leaves you with complete disillusionment about the current banking system. It made me realize that we're all being lied to and defrauded at every turn but this realisation takes time.

Fiat quite literally defrauds it's holders value in a slow, consistent way. In any shape or form virtual currencies are here to stay because they can't be printed out of existence, the ease of movement and because it completely dis-intermediates and entire industry.  
The current bitcoin merchants that own food trucks and make stuff on etsy will eventually grow into the mom and pop stores that you know today. Access to bitcoin is as ubiquitous as having access to a smartphone, it doesn't take a large leap of imagination to see how prevalent it will become.

Bitcoin is money 
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:32:53
I think the biggest benefit is often overlooked: 24hr international transfer of funds for almost free, offering the owner more freedom than ever before. That alone is the game changer. The Indian son who wants to transfer money from his job in England to his family in Calcutta can do it whenever he wants, a Ukrainian worker can send money to his wife and child. A skilled online worker who can't get a visa can still have access to markets in other countries. This already happens. Bitcoin is the financial instrument that the internet has needed for years and it's only in the early nebulous of it's potential. Crypto-currency will create a whole paradigm shift and new ways of implementation that we can't even imagine right now. The followers of bitcoin are so adamant for it's success (rightly so) that they will evangelist it until it creates serious changes to the financial industry. That is what you are buying into when you hold a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:39:20

12 months, a slew of new systems are brought online with serious financial backing which promote safe coin exchange, escrow and other services. Existing systems (the ones we know now) will have proven their reputation as being reliable. Uptake is slow but steady with some friction on getting fiat into Bitcoin.
36 months, civil unrest breaks out in a small country and bitcoin absorbs the majority of the fallout as citizens scramble to save their retirement funds from their local collapsing fiat currency. Major central banks sit up and notice.
48 months,  the last of the big companies accept bitcoin as a payment system.
60 months, I will have a very large platinum medallion with the words: "drcross told you so, bitches" emblazoned across it commissioned and I'll wear it to most of my cocktail parties.

A centralised service was kinda what I was referring to. Sure you could run an armoury style client on your device but it's doubtful people in a third world would be in a position to have multiple backups of their private keys (without trying to sound sanctimonious). A stable bitcoin service which linked IMEI digits, a username, password and target recipient would probably flurish if people had confidence in it.

It's not rinse, repeat because each time a bubble and crash happens coins are being give from a small number of weak hands into a large number of strong hands. After some cycles bitcoin is distributed properly across the world instead of concentrated in a single place. The bubble and crash cycle lessens.

At the moment we are only priming the system with enough money and establishing the merchant base. Within 12 months you'll see huge leaps and bounds but we need a far higher monetary base to do that.

Some have argued that the growth rate was too fast, I didn't think this. Typically someone who is considering selling their bitcoins will hold off if the price is rising, then when prices level they will process the sell. Group a few of these selers together and the price drops as people try to catch the last of what the consider to be a good price for their coins. The overall trend is upwards because more people are adopting bitcoin so I have no interest in selling.

You are referring to the school Keynesian economic thought. Money flows to stocks because people realise that interest rates on savings won't be enough to overcome inflation which is the dilution of your money. People buy things they don't particularly need because their money won't buy as many things in the future. This is opposite to Austrian economics which encourages saving, not spending more than you need to and is a more wholesome and sound way to keep your money. This is why the dollar was originally based on the gold standard because the founding fathers knew the value of this. With Bitcoin we can resume back to this monetary system and reign in the government from having total power to do what they like.

I know what I'm about to say is less practical right now but the bitcoin protocol supports extra functions that are **already built in** that would allow this to happen, without having any manual interventions (unlike indigogo or kickstarter).

Agreed, when the big american players invest real money into bitcoin we won't have the trepidation that we currently see with fears of government clampdown.

Yes, your analogy works as a description to the mining process, not the block allocation. The way I sometimes describe it is the following, mining is like a holding a sprint race to see who can get the farthest in 10 minutes, if you are fit you stand a good chance of winning, if everyone is fit then the finish line is extended a bit further so the race still takes approximately 10 minutes, if all the runners are slow or sick the finish line is reduced to keep the race finishing in 10 minutes based on the previous race time.

Google owns them.

24 month prediction, a sovereign currency starts to slide into hyper inflation and bitcoin is taken up as a way for citizens to save their retirement pensions from being worthless, like what was suggested to happen in Cyprus, but this time it will be real. Bitcoin will be forced centre stage and millions of more people realise the benefit. The would be the "to the moon" moment, and honestly, when you compare it to the fiat system, there is no way that it's not going to happen unless something crazy happens over the event horizon.

Let's face some facts. I (like many others) was in this from the start to make some quick money. Now I've realised that switching back to fiat is downright risky, when you go down the bitcoin rabbit hole you realise how much you are being fucked by the state and the debt based central bank system. I will never switch my savings to fiat unless I need something that I can't buy with Bitcoin.

On reflection my post could be construed that I am just trying to profiteer, but what I really mean to emphasize is: yes Bitcoin has some amazing features that are mostly untapped at the moment, but for some people who may have (for example) saved their pension all their life a quick stroke of a pen could wipe them all out. 
For them the need for a valuable store of money is immediate, they don't care about buying bread and milk with Bitcoin (yet) but saving their investment that they spent years building so that they don't have to grow old in fear. There is a good documentary on the Argentinian debt crysis, 
I think it's this one: 
To surmise, I suppose we could both be in agreement when we say that the potential uses and benefits of Bitcoin are manyfold and will be different for different people.

When you buy into bitcoin it's easy to see it appreciate in value, so if you're a believer you'll assume you'll soon get your discount back plus growth. It also allows people to get involved thinking they're saving money by exchanging fiat for bitcoin and gets them started in the marketplace.

@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:30
Nicely put. Bitcoin holders could be forgiven for hoarding because the rapid increase of purchasing power didn't make sense to spend them. Exchange for goods and services can only happen when both parties are in agreement with the value of the item at stake, stability is needed for this to happen. More than press or promotion what Bitcoin needs is stability, all the other benefits to bitcoin are already in place.
@_date: 2013-08-27 22:45:18
My alternative take on the recent price hike: Instead of investors being bullish on the state of bitcoin following the meeting, they are very bearish about everything including the state of MtGox. The only way to pull out would be to buy bitcoin and get them off the exchange, increasing the price but also influencing the rest of the exchanges- in the opposite way as intended. Either way I still believe in the long term prospects here but I was wondering if anyone else was thinking the same?
@_date: 2013-09-08 10:29:15

If the Bitcoin port was restricted at the outer firewall, I think that with satellite communication, even have a small number of nodes within the country would prevent this situation from happening, if they restricted the ports at an ISP level I'm not sure what would happen, port tunnelling perhaps?

This is a ridiculous thought experiment because as each new all-time-high happens the early adopter's drop out and sell their coins. Buying coins now may seem obvious in 2015 when bitcoin will have reached 10,000 dollars  but no one knows so it's pointless to speculate like this.

This is used as an example as why it will go bust in other words "it's too small so it is doomed to failure"


weasel words, when in actual fact, the government lack of regulation is a benefit.


There are only 10 million bitcoins, NO ONE OWNS 1 MILLION COINS. 
Even if there was, the act of selling them would only drop the price by 10%, not a spiral to zero. source: grade school math.


More like tens of millions which would have to include a manufacturing fab and a team of advanced ASIC developers.

Personally I think this is just people waiting for the bottom of the trough before buying again using the fiat they already had on the exchanges from any sells. That and the news is generally positive for Bitcoin at the moment. Many n00bs have experienced their first crash and realised that a dip in price doesn't mean anything in the long term.

I'm not American but the dollar is currently the worlds reserve currency. USD is used in many countries where their currency is unstable. It will be the biggest meltdown that the world has ever seen (I know it sound like hyperbole), and I think it's inevitable. Someday we'll wake up to see it has slumped 20%, people will be very confused and think it's a temporary thing, until it continues to slide further and further down. Mass panic and hysteria will ensue.

It's obvious that the country won't officially go bitcoin but unofficially bitcoin could sweep through the country.

You are contradicting yourself but let me first address your question


Intrinsic value is different to market value, tungsten is cheaper because it is plentiful.

Agreed. Old Timer here. There is a huge influx of new bitcoin users and the FUD is just nuts. Bitcoin isn't a penny stock. It's a new breed of money. The potential is astronomical. If this is your first crash just look at the long term chart to see how it has ALWAYS recovered, relax and open a beer. We're on track for success but it's expected to have a cool off period after a large bull run.
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:10:53
I've been watching 200+ members join per day. This, to me, is one of the best indications of organic growth. If everyone that joined bought just half a bitcoin, we'd have stability through diversification. The sooner we can get rid of the larger bitcoin owners who have the ability to rattle the market with large sells the better.
@_date: 2013-07-03 06:15:54
Individual merchants with low volume transactions dont add much to the global volume of bitcoin but they are absolutely necessary widespread adoption for the tipping point that we are heading to. For every new business that we hear about on that is accepting bitcoin there are at least 10 that we don't hear about. The fact that bitcoin has been stressed tested and had not technical problems in the past few months is a buy signal for me. I can handle a low price, in the long term it means nothing. Lets get some perspective, less than two months ago it was 260 dollars per bitcoin. What has changed that is preventing it going to that level again?
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:23:24

IMHO Bitcoins biggest price gains are yet to be realised, we've another order of magnitude to go. Proper supporting technology has not been developed yet so your prediction is shortsighted.

This is just my personal opinion but i think that the underground movement is growing but at the same time there have been some regulation setbacks (inability to deposit fiat in to bitcoin exchanges in the uk for example). These two effects have an opposing force and currently the government is winning but when the critical mass happens they wont be able to stop it (they work for us after all). Everyday i see new businesses accept bitcoin and that for me is the greatest buy indicator so i don't mind the current depression one iota.

I'm sorry I can't find a link but if I had to speculate a guess: 
One of the strengths of bitcoin (it's speed) would allow mass entry and exit to the market. With this as a basis, during consumer confidence oscillation (as happens with every market) we would see massive fluctuations in price until such a time as there is such a high market cap and diversity of users that will eventually lead to relative price stabilisation.

@_date: 2013-11-19 02:53:10
I wrote the following to the comment section, let's see if it gets approved. 
1. Bitcoin by definition and implementation is not a Ponzi scheme. Further research is left to the reader.
2. The author neglected several key benefits that make Bitcoin an alternative to the current debt based central banking system. It's deflationary in design, similar to gold in that there are a hard number that will ever be created, your government can't print off more on a whim (effectively stealing from you). it's borderless and allows for international transactions within seconds (instead of days with the traditional banking system). The fees are so low as to make them almost free (compared to Paypal or Western Union's 2-3%). It's very easy for merchants to get onboard, as can be seen from it's recent uptake.
3. The recent volatility is expected as part of the growing pains of a transformative technology, when the monetary base equals that of a large nation state it will demonstrate the apparent stability of one. At time of writing Bitcoin has a narrow stock of money which exceeds that of Croatia.
4. We've seen what email has done to the postal service,  what mp3 has done to the music industry and what websites have done to traditional media outlets, to write Bitcoin off as a flash in the pan is myopic.

If you hold 1 full bitcoin or more and then in turn bitcoin eventually becomes used by just 1% of global transactions you will be a millionaire by current dollar terms, so it's a no brainer from an investment point of view. 
There are currently no reasons why bitcoin cannot become the vehicle to handle this level of transactions apart from the lack of uptake. All indications from the most knowledgeable places over the past 36 months that I can find demonstrate that it has no weak points that cannot be fixed, but then again I'm only a lowly MSc graduate.

I thought the same recently- a perfect damped oscillation, except now that has settled the inherent benefit brought about by stability will increase it's attractiveness. Even though I am heavily invested in bitcoin, i'd much prefer to see long term stability and gradual gains over this pump and dump mania.

buying low, selling high. I don't allude to have a magic secret and anyone who does is lying. It all boils down to your faith in bitcoins as a currency and the stage at when you are satisfied to sell.
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:08:11


That's my point. You originally said Bitcoin would replace Paypal.


Scarcity is an external attribute and not relating to the material itself. Gold has lower intrinsic value than tungsten for example because it's softer and has less practical uses (tungsten is a necessity for catalytic convertors for example). Other cheaper metals have properties which are far better for practical application compared to gold, this is what is meant by intrinsic.


It's a store of value like any other currency is, like the euro has value in the spreasheets and balance books that it is entered in. People's perceived value (whether you agree with it or not) in these monetary units are the basis for the costs we put on them. Bitcoin has value in and of itself because of the different reasons that people will explain all across this subreddit. 


The electricity costs with regards to mining are far preferable to having children down a mine with pickaxes in Sierra Leone for diamonds, or the petrol products which are purged in the processing of gold.

Ok I'll bite
1. One does not simply create a quantum computer, if we did all traditional banking systems would also be rendered insecure.
2. The core development team. Yes you can update if you follow the rules similar to any open source project. These people have a vested interest in the long term success of bitcoin. We dont have to trust them, we just have to trust the code.
3. We can create forks, as happened last march, it's no biggie.
4. The blockchain records all transactions, taxation entities will have to adapt, and believe me, they will.
5. The debt based finantial system is the one that is unsafe. Imagine waking up some morning and your dollar is worth 50% of what it was the day before. This will happen some day when foreign states start to leave the dollar.
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:23:43
True, but my point was people need fiat for a lot of things at the moment (while bitcoin is not yet established) and you can't explain large amounts of cash turning up in your bank account if you get a regular paycheck.

EDIT: I see your new description: 


But for every purchase of bitcoin there is also someone exiting for fiat so I still don't get understand the value here. For example the fees are free in BTC China, so of course we're going to see a bigger churn of coins but it doesnt exactly mean that fiat is being sent into the system, it would be of more value if every *rise* of price shows BTC going to a country, and every *lowering* of price sees bitcoin returned.

Word-of-mouth. 
Personally speaking, "regular" people are not going to listen to me harp on about a global currency because of my history in computer science. When a regular Joe (for the want of a better description) hears his buddy talk about bitcoin down at the gym or his mechanic says he accepts bitcoin as payment you'd be suprised how quickly people get on board. People generally resist thinking about new concepts until they decide that they need to and bitcoin isn't too much of a new concept. 
The learning curve for bitcoin is enjoyable- "The problem, banks and governments are stealing our money. The solution- Bitcoin allows people more control over their own finances to the point where we don't need banks anymore."

If bitcoin is seen as a threat to government and the banking industry they would have resources in the order of billions, not millions to 'neutralise' the problem.

The traditional notion was that "banks are safe". We've seen time and time again that this is not the case and that whenever you leave money in a bank that you are taking a gamble that it might not be there some day.
Most people think they *need* a bank because modern society puts forth the concept that having: direct debit payments for utilities, the convenience of a chargecard or having your employer pay directly into a account are necessary. The banks take a cut of all of these transactions while still having access to gamble with your money on the financial markets as they see fit. 
Bitcoin allows you to circumvent all of this and restores power to the user to have ultimate control with his/her money.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:57:56
If one million coins were sold in a quick space of time, the inherent value of Bitcoin over other trading forms would not affect my position and the many like me who live in countries where FX transaction fees highly impact import costs. There are millions of us. 24 hour banking and the ability for anyone to have an account are other significant benefits which add to this inherent value.
Lack of guarantees will keep the large speculators away and that's absolutely fine by me. It's propping up and bailing out the people who have gambled with tax payers money that has already wreaked enough havoc to the existing financial system.

Whoever created Bitcoin was a very smart individual or group, with the meticulous foresight to cover their tracks to the point of becoming invisible. They showed (through forum posts) that they were anti establishment so it's safe to assume they they also prophesied the establishment would try to fight against them, and by implication, since they have not used the coins yet, still see the environment as hostile to bitcoin and that the future price of the coins will also be higher.

Look to the previous crash or two, it's cyclical.

There are some holes in your argument. 
|replace the need for VISA, Paypal
Paypal is an escrow services and compliments Bitcoin without replacing it (however badly the comparison is)
| Gold has intrinsic value
it has minor uses (low conductive properties for electronics) but there is nothing significantly intrinsic in the cost value, sure you can make watches and jewelry out of it but the scarcity is what gives it value, and this is far from intrinsic value.
|Cryptocurrencies are killer because they could literally replace banks
Banks original purpose was a safe store of your value, that's why in the future there will be bitcoin banks who sell you storage based on their reputation (see kitecoin).
| he value of Bitcoin should be more closely aligned with the value of companies it could replace
I consider this a myopic viewpoint because Bitcoin has different uses and tractional functions which haven't been developed yet. It also allows a store of value along with speed of use, thereby combining gold and international wire transfer in one place, so what may be more correct is the *combined* value of 1. the banks, 2. all international remittance firms 3. gold's store of value 4. micropayments 5. anything else we find along the way

I didn't realise you were looking for a more basic explanation instead of a broader market analysis. There are 500,000 dollars worth of bitcoins created each day, this is relatively small, almost to the point where you could consider it a fixed amount of bitcoins. When people want more of a certain "thing" the prices go up and if people don't want it (or figure it is over valued) they might sell it, the price you are looking at with Bitcoin is the raw confidence in the bitcoin concept.

This is the reason hoarders of programmers are making Bitcoin easier for the average individual as we speak. We're currently using the "dial up modem" version of bitcoin which will eventually turn into "the ipad experience" of bitcoin. Eventually the day will come where the mavens of society get involved and we'll hit that turning point.

The article is so poorly written that I can't even comprehend the link they are making. This is absurd and the most ridiculous case of fearmongering I have ever seen. Expect more of it I presume. 
TLDR EDIT: 


I thought all of the original coins remained untouched? This is ridiculous, why don't they just link us to the transaction instead of baiting us for ad impressions?

Mining is a very technical operation at this stage so unless you are a specialist you're best not to bother. So that leaves purchasing bitcoins directly.

As a bitcoin "oldtimer" people have been saying this since they were 40 cents each. The peak of the second bubble was 11 dollars, so even if you bought then you would have massive return on investment but the trend is always up. The true converts dont see it as "investing" to make money but as a way to "buy into a new system and out of an old"

While correct, it's probably not the most helpful advice this person is looking for. The answer is that Bitcoin is open source so you can look through the code yourself. Crypto analysis researchers have poured through the code and many people have tried to hack it and found that it cant. Bitcoin uses industry standard encryption so if it breaks you banks security, internet connections and other things would also be compromised.

Pfff, Bill's a nobody, Steve Job recently checked the code and he says it's legit.

China has 1.3 billion people. They only need a small number of people on board to result in what we are seeing, so no, they're not running around with To The Moon t-shirts on. The Chinese have been familiar with digital currencies since QQ, it was like the Napster of Chinese money that at one stage held considerable value. It was shut down by the government (in a similar way to liberty reserve) because it was centralised. Word has got out that Bitcoin is an improvement because it can't be shut down so it was only a small leap of faith to get onboard with Bitcoin.

Two things are happening which constantly play off each other which result in a stable price:
1. New users arrive who are investing in the market (or not investing). 
2. Miners are creating new bitcoins and selling them (or not selling them).
Some miners are not selling their coins and some new users with fists full of cash are not buying, the rate of each vary throughout the hour.

Bitcoin is by definition not a ponzi scheme. I've watched hordes of people convert from hating bitcoin to being absolutely fascinated with it so you're going to have to ask yourself, what is it about this that you cannot understand and why are you rejecting it when so many have no problems with it.

The collapse of fiat is many years away, WU could still retain relevancy during this time by accepting bitcoin as an extra currency because it generates extra revenue. While the broader long range picture shows the complete meltdown of fiat and amelioration of companies such as WU in the short term the old rich men still stand to make a profit so it's something that could easily happen.

Some day in the future, when a farmer in Nairobi sells potatoes in bitcoin or a young girl buys a prom dress in the Ukraine in bitcoin the market will have such a diverse set of people with differing interests that these set of fluctuations will not happen. Bitcoin will generally tend to go "up and to the right" until that day.
