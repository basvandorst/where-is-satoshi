that's very strange... I just checked again.. and if I pay £50/month I can process as many payments as I like for free... no limit...

I'll have a look later on
I got an email from the federation of small businesses a while back and signed up online
the card machine links to a mobile phone via bluetooth so you can use it anywhere, it's pretty neat :-)

am I doing something wrong...
ok I know prices are still high... but according to tis calculator
the ROI is only 16 days ?

but, if I can pay £50/month and then have all transactions processed for free.... £50/month for a supermarket turning £1million a week is 0.005%
plus... if you're processing a lot of cards, I'm pretty sure you'll get it done for free anyway
I think the transaction fees for people like me (who don't take many card payments) are more of an admin fee than anything else
    .
as I said before, I'm PRO BITCOIN... but if we want to argue the merits of bitcoins then everyone needs to know the facts... it's like arguing about sailing to foreign countries and you think the world is flat... as soon as someone comes along and says the world is round all your arguments are screwed... if we want to promote bitcoins we need to get our facts straight !

don't know how it is in the rest of the world
but in the UK, if you don't take many card payments, you normally pay 2.% on each payment to the company who handles it for you..
OR... you can pay £50/month and then take as many card payments as you like for free :-)
(I assume the cost is different for different service providers but should be approx. the same)

sorry, I should have been clearer, my point was that people keep talking about haing to pay X% on card transactions and bitcoin being free, when really most card transactions are so cheap they might as well be free
I'll probably get down voted to hell for this... but I'm just pointing out the facts...

yes credit cards (and debit cards)
I've got a card machine at work, I pay 2% on each transaction (because we hardly use it, not worth the £50 month)
ok bitcoin could save me a bit, but not much, about £10/month on average... fee's will make next to no difference to supermarkets etc..
    .
fraud is a better angle for bitcoins, if someone fraudulently uses a card at a vendor, it's the vendor that loses out not the card company/bank (in the uk anyway - the bank refunds you then takes it back from the vendor)
tho I guess once bitcoins become mainstream something might have to be organised for that... like if your bitcoins are stolen, and you can prove it, I guess the vendor will have to return them to you ?
