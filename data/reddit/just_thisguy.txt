Correct analogy is dotcom bubble vs. whole crypto market bubble (not just bitcoin). I agree that it should go up a few more times or even 5x to 10x before the bubble pops. Dotcom bubble also had a number of companies that did make since (Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo!, etc...) but when the bubble popped those got dragged down hard too. 
So even if bitcoin is the one (aka Amazon) it will drop (60 to 85%) when all the other stuff goes down. Also Google was not even around at the time so the "One" coin might not even be around yet and will only be created after the whole crypto crash.
So the take away is Bitcoin will probably go up to $50k to $150k before the crash and might be as low as $15k to $50k after the crash. And in 10 years after the crash if its the One be $1M to $10M.

I think his talking about Crypto in general, is crypto a bubble in general? Hell Yes! 
Will crypto take over the world in 10 or 20 years? Hell Yes! (well probably)
If you pick the right coin(s) its going to be the best money making opportunity of our generation. If you pick the wrong one you will loose it all.

Yup, this is bitcoin with the idiotically high fees. If we are not going to fix this soon bitcoin will end up being a Yahoo or even Excite of crypto.
This is not like years before, there is now competition in crypto. Bitcoin needs a solution and STOP saying its LN! LN will still need more on chain transactions than we currently do even if we had LN 100% adopted right now. We need LN, but it will be about as useful as Formula One in a forest.

LN Cash vs. LN Core
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:28:33
We need to do both, 4MB block and Segwit (mandatory). If anyone got a better solution tell me! 
And as I've said before, LN will need base transactions in much larger volume anyway. 4MB block and Segwit will get us to LN.

Looking at charts for the past 2 months, $12k maybe 15k price range was sustainable, anything above was just a short spike.
Oh and look at this, its at 12k now.
My bet is it will be over $50k by the end of the year, but it will suffer drops in the mean time, probably another big drop from $30k to $15k and from $50k to $30k before earning that $50k for real.
In the mean time it might still drop to $5k to 7k range if we see a crash. What we've seen in the past few days is not a crash, but a correction.

- If 20% was a correction we'd have corrections almost every day
- 90% for bubble burst seems right to me
- I'd say 60% to 70% is a crash
from my perspective can you have multiple crashes in just a few months with each crash leading to new ATH? Does not sound right, that seems a correction. So many the whole idea of corrections/crashes/bubble bursts can only be defined after the fact, correction has quick recovery, crash average, bubble burst takes years to recover.

Yeah, we need a crash that will flush out all the dumb money, hence dumb money will leave shitcoins and good coins, while good coins will still have smart money and true believers in the tech to prop it up (so they will not fall as much as the others).
Its still scary, but it is needed.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:24:27
Given that fact that altcoins are not falling all that much faster than BTC this is not a bubble burst yet. Particularly considering that fact that many altcoins have gained far more than bitcoin in the past few weeks or months.
I want to see some altcoins crash hard like 90% or more and I want to see market picking clear leaders (coins that don't crash as much, b/c shitcoins are being sold for "good" coins) before I'd think this was a real crash, its correction for now.

As I've said its only to bridge the gap to LN, and even with LN we need more base load. 1MB 8 years ago is not the same as 1MB today (its much cheaper). 
And no its not the same as bcash, bcash does not have long term plan, but to increase block size, we have LN. Basically I explained it all above.
This is exactly what I'm talking about, this attitude. You say no, but what is your real solution?

No thank you, they will build in inflation or if not, can always add inflation later, the thing with centralized authority is they can always make any changes they want, just like they are doing with the current USD, granted US-backed altcoin will probably be better than USD, but not bitcoin. 
Also another year or two and bitcoin's market cap will be in the trillions, it will be much harder to release an alt or make illegal, so lets hope US takes its sweet time making an altcoin...

I mean if Segwit was adapted by 100% of bitcoin network not world, what I'm trying to figure out is if Segwit will even do anything... If its only helping 10% for example, why are we even talking about it. If its 50 to 100% it helps, but again we will probably still be at $10 transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:42:46


Great point! If your argument is don't increase block size as it will make things more centralized (b/c disk size) its BS as disk size increased considerably from 8 years ago, so we can handle 2MB or 4MB block size without any issue, we should at least peg the block size to storage cost. People immediately jump to 100MB block sizes or even 1GB block size argument to kill block size increase, to those people I say you are being disingenuous! We are talking about increase of 2x or 4x not 100x or more, so stop saying 100MB blocks are not going to work, we know and we are not asking for it!
I'm not talking about increasing block size as the silver bullet, but that, plus making a major push by the community to switch to Segwit will help until we get LN, and as people said even if we had LN today we'd still need to increase base transaction capacity to handle all the new transactions that LN will bring by opening and closing channels.
If you have a better idea please tell us! But waiting for LN for even 1 more year is not the answer, we need something to be able to wait for LN.
PS: I'm all for bitcoin and not for bcash
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:21:46
I'm not disputing your over all argument, just pointing out a few things. 
Moor's law is not the fundamental law, as you say, however I think we have still a ways to go before we reach any real limits. Fully photonics computing can push us very far along just to give one example (with a huge drop in power consumption). Not far enough to break bitcoin however... But you can imagine a scenario if Bitcoin was world's currency in 100 years and had value of 100T+(market cap) a bad actor might spend 1T on a computing cluster with 22nd century tech (computing power of that can be trillion billion times more than current 10 million dollar cluster), nearly free energy from solar power might also be used.
Again I'm not saying that it will break bitcoin, just that your "ridiculously generous scenario" might not be so ridiculous after all.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:57:07
So I can open a LN chanel and use it for like a month or even a year and I can keep adding money to it?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:39:25
The simple answer is, there is no solution yet, LN will not work just by it self as it will still need to use the base channel to open and close. The best answer I've heard is developers with find a way. But frankly only true believers are satisfied with that answer. Still I'd go with bitcoin over any other coin for now...
If someone does know of a solution please let me know.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:41
While I get your sentiment, this is ridiculous, its been less then a day since CB Bcash fuck up, nobody opened an account and went through all the checks with any reputable exchange yet.
The only way anyone could have "moved" is if they already had functional accounts on other exchanges...
Lets be real at this point cryptocurrency exchanges (all of them) suck much more than most banks. I'm not saying this b/c I like banks or I don't like crypto, I'm saying this so we don't fool ourselves into thinking crypto is anywhere yet, we need to know how shity it is, so we can fix it. The future is bright; however, we are still in the gutter.

I will be fine with difference between $18,600 and $186,000. Yes I still think its dumb, as you can just get it now for $17,400, and incase it does crash for a few weeks during the settlement date you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:27:01
I am trusting the devs, I'm not nocking on anything, what I am asking is what solutions are there? Segwit... Yes, but that's not enough. And why are you talking about bcash? We all know bcash is shit coin. What I care about is making Bitcoin better... But you cant have $10 transactions.

I don't have good reason for 100M per, I guess I was exaggerating a bit, but I think 10M per is very likely in 10 to 20 years, I think that 1M per number is relatively easy by 2020, but another 10x will take 10 to 15 years.
I think we have both value in store of value and currency at this point currency is much harder to justify as we have all the issues, as we all know, not going to list here. Lets hope LN and other projects fix that. 
But the store of value is kinda easy we all just need to agree that that's our store of value, I don't see a reason why bitcoin cant be store of value as large as gold or even 2x gold by 2020, so that's your 1M per. However it can also be a store of value for currency when people get it that inflations is like your number one enemy (not even talking about shit currencies) over 10 years inflation is a bitch even in US, imagine if you can just avoid it?! I can see a world where we keep anything more than few 1000s in bitcoin and cash out when we need to pay the bills and buy shit, so you still have all the USD and what not but people mostly keep bitcoin that will get you 10M per. 
If we can get easy and cheap (probably free) transactions we go to full currency and full store of value so dubble whammy. And this could give you 100M per but that's probably 20 to 30 years from now.
PS: its not that hard for USD to have 300% inflation in 30 years even without hyperinflation (current debt is 20T and going up, inflation is the only way to pay for it) so that will be 30M each in todays money. And you also need to consider capital market growth and productivity growth of the whole world in 30 years time.

While US, Britain, France, etc... had the gold standard, or before that used gold/silver directly there was virtually no inflation (under 0.01%) and the economies did just fine. The only reason countries got off gold standard is b/c they ran out of money (as in spent too much), business sentiently did not want to get off the gold standard. I don't see a reason why Bitcoin needs inflation. While countries will need to find another way to pay down debt, my guess is more taxies.
 
People will still spend Bitcoin if it was the main currency (even while its significantly deflationary), they still need to live, eat, house, travel and do all the other things. The savings rate will increase yes, but that's not a bad thing, it does not mean investment (investments done directly with bitcoin that never get converted into say USD can be repaid back in bitcoin) will decrease as a society we might end-up with more efficient capital that's spent on more directly impactful things.
While you still have both USD and Bitcoin, you will spend the one that's loosing value 1st, but if you get payed in Bitcoin, you going to spend Bitcoin.

Keep in mind, a house 50 years ago for $30k did not have half as much shit as a house now for $500k, not to mention they are bigger too. Also a house cost more b/c places are getting more population and some just get over priced b/c of tech companies making a shit load of money for investors/employees so a lot of places in CA, WA, etc, should not count. Also they don't make land no more but they still make lots of babies... I agree with your main point, but house example is not good. Also yes dollar will go to shit, but Bitcoin might go to shit even faster, you really should have both and also a house, a house or land is actually the best hedge against inflation.

Banks can make BTC acceptable to none early adopters. From there better/cheaper/leaner services/apps can steal customers from banks. 
Banks and Gov. will still make a lot of money on BTC (well at the very least early adapters will), for example imagine if BofA just buys $2 billion worth of BTC and holds it (its basically nothing to them) but if BTC market cap goes to $100 Trillion, same with Gov. imagine if Norway buys $10 billion worth of BTC now, or for that matter $50 billion.

This is big, really I think Square could end up being the one to bring BTC to the masses. If Square integrates BTC into POS they can start displacing credit/debit card transactions (making sure to add seem-less IRS reporting). They should be able to charge merchants less for transactions b/c they don't need to give a cut to Visa/Mastercard/AMEX or for that matter the banks.

Oh, ok that helps, thanks, but still seems crazy, like they could not find another "investment" that at least give them the full money back? I mean if they think that's the best action b/c things will look so bad between now and 30 years from now, we are indeed in trouble. Could they not buy some land? surly in 30 years land should appreciate some, particularly given inflation.

GOV apologist? how so? I think the current monetary system is crap, I'm just pointing out that transition to BTC alone could end up with less people owning more money. However I'm not saying lets not use BTC, in fact lets do! Just don't be surprised that 10 or 100 people might not end up with most of it.

Not sure Libra should be an issue if it was done by much smaller company like Square, people just don't trust Facebook (if you are talking about public and gov. approval), if you are talking about Libra being controlled by a single entity, yeah that's bad and really not going to fly.
On the other hand if Facebook for example just tried to integrate LN or even their own solution, but run on BTC, I don't think there would be much opposition.

I'd love to see a graph showing what might happen if say 30% of those people tried to buy and hold 1 BTC in the next 10 years, looking at current trading volume and price and extrapolating from there (given the demand from those people), I don't know if such a graph would tell you anything, but it still l might be interesting. This inflow also probably needs to be exponential, so year one you only getting 0.5% of that 30% and year 10 your getting 50% of the total.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:47:51
Yeah, that's a big problem, but don't get me wrong, BTC should benefit more people than bank accounts or current $$$, and maybe we will have only a few people with most BTC, but its not the same as having contries in control of the BTC, so might still be much better than now (control wise). And your bottom 2 or 3 billion will be able to transact using BTC and whatever next layer much better than now, but I don't think they will make any capital gains on BTC (nothing like the 1st few million).
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:18:46

We are basically talking investors, banks really don't give money unless you have it and don't really need it (only need it to make even more money, but you better show you already making a ton comparatively). This is why you have investors willing to risk far more than a bank but than investors are looking for 10x or more return not 5 or 10% per year, so in this case the cloud miners found investors that are willing to only make 5% per year but risk everything. Cloud mining might have looked ok for a month or two when BTC price was supper high and hash rate did not catch up to it yet. But even than it never looked great. I wander if OP would have made some money if the BTC price still hold at $20k, my guess is still probably not.

There is nothing sane about any of this, it could be 1M by 2020 or it could be 0. I'd say both are just as likely. 
Also if we can get to 100k by 2019 we can get to 1M by 2020. If its at 100k it will be taken very seriously and probably will be part of most mutual funds and petition founds (even if its just 1% or 0.5% of the funds holdings), if that happens they will add more and more bitcoin to the funds and we get 1M easy. 10k looks like lots to us right now, but to big boys its still too small to even play with.

I think the caveat here is make sure you know what you are doing with hardware wallet, you are probably more likely to loose your hardware waller or your phase or whatever than say Coinbase getting hacked.

Most exchanges have LIMIT orders for example gdax and gemini do, just change your "market" order to "limit" and set the price you want to pay, this way for example if you set a limit order to buy at 8k and in two mo. its at 8k for two sec. you get your bitcoins. You can do the same thing to sell orders too, but I don't recommend unless you like to sell low :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:22:04

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:09
Welcome to bitcoin everyone, where you can go from 11k to 8.6k and back to 10.5k in less than 30 min. I suggest you have LIMIT buy orders in place just for stuff like this, b/c the exchanges are not going to fucking work for you when you need it most.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:39:20
The "bubble" might even go to $100k per, but to get anymore and make sure that 100k does not go back to 10k we need real adaptation.
You need a catalyst someone huge to buy into it like Amazon starts accepting bitcoin and actually push it (like making it easy, doing Amazon wallet or even Amazon bitcoin exchange), if Amazon did it almost everyone else will have no choice, but to do it too.
Or some very large founds buy into bitcoin in a big way, like if China started buying $100 billion USD per year into it, like maybe convert US bonds... If that happens everyone else will follow, I mean like other nations. 
At that point we could see 1M to 5M per bitcoin.

Yahoo was at the top of the game, and then there was Google...
- we need crypto to have transaction fees less than .01% or even free (even for very small transactions)
- we need instant transfer clearance (sub second)
- we need ability to handle trillions+ of transactions per second
- we need ability to send amounts less than .0001 of a USD penny
Bitcoin is great, but it still sucks, give what you should be able to do with it. All I'm saying is there is room for improvement.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:14:22
Nothing will change as far as a few people in control, even if BTC is the only currency, only a few people own it now and most have none. Sure a lot of people (relatively) will get rich on BTC but most will not, you can also argue that the big names in BTC (people that own a lot of it) will be far worse at this than the current few people that own or control most of the $$$. Most people that have a lot of BTC now are just lucky or already have tons of cash and got a bunch of BTC (note some are one in the same), but for the most part those people did not do anything to "earn" that money, not in the same way that say Bill Gates did or Jeff or whoever and therefor those people are just not ready to have billions or even trillions under their command, this is how you end up with people acting like dicks in crypto (not saying all are just a good %). So maybe BTC might make millionaires out of 500,000 people, make good money for another 10,000,000 (and they might not be the same people that have $$ now, but probably most will be) and maybe we end up without federal reserve (if things really change), but your still going to end up with less than 100 people having more than 50% of all BTC. And if we are not lucky it could be 10 people.
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:05:20
While I agree with this and this is a great stat, one thing to note is most millionaires don't just keep the money in currency they own stocks/mutual funds/private businesses/real estate/etc... So its not like all those 33 millions will go and try to buy 1 BTC each, I mean sure they might want to, but in order to do that they need to sell all other "stuff" and they are not going to do that. On the other hand plenty of the 33 million have more than one million so they will try to buy 1 BTC and some 1,000s of BTC.

I get this, and that was my exact view, but now looking at SpaceX, if we cut NASA's budget by 50% and give it to SpaceX, in 20 years we'd have Moon Base, Mars Colony, robotic landers on 10+ other worlds with sample return and probably already real plans for Titan and Europa man missions. What I mean by this is have NASA only work on payloads and truly experimental stuff like new tech and materials. Let SpaceX take care of delivery.
Also what we need is to stop this one off space probe/lander/rover crap, we need to start thinking about this as assembly line with iterative design, just start building 5 of each every year. And pay SpaceX to sling them as many places as possible.

Good point, so it seems world currency supply is around ~US$60T and world assets are around ~US$700-600T, so it seems to be that bitcoin even in the best case can only replace all the currency not assets (I know bitcoin is more like gold than money so more of an asset, it gets fuzzy here, so maybe bitcoin can replace some assets too).
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:47:02
I'd say bitcoin has a chance to replace most currencies in the world:
    if there is no bitcoin hack, 
    if there is not something much better
    if bitcoin can do much better than 7 transitions per sec.
If so, world economy is ~US$80 trillion so say half of that number ~US$40T can be bitcoin market cap. there can be 21 million bitcoins, some still need to be mined and some are lost. So say 12 million bitcoins currently (that's what people say). $40T/12M = ~US$3,333,333 per bitcoin todays dollars. How long this will take? Not sure, 20 years?
The number of bitcoins will grow, but so does the world economy, so those two might cancel each other out.
I'd love to hear more ideas.

If we want to make bitcoin work it needs to be used by lots of people and for this reason it needs to be very simple to use (it is not right now), do you really think that majority of people could handle (well) what it takes now to manage your own bitcoin in a safe way? The reality is that your bank loosing money/taking it is less risky than you trying to keep your coin and make sure you don't loose it to theft/fire/doing something dumb. 
What we probably will end up with is some type of "bank" that will manage at the very least our daily/monthly transactions (it be nice to have some tech help here, 2nd or 3rd layer that will make things a bit less "bank owns your money" deal). What we really need is a party that can some how manage and store your key without having access to it (even better if that party was not under jurisdiction or just very hard to in-force location). Maybe this can all be done per to per without centralized entity, but than we already have bitcoin lol
