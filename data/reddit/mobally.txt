Depends on your tolerance for risk. I diversified a bit out of crypto - I wanted to keep the same potential upside so I got 2 year long call options on gold mining stocks. 
Whatever forces are driving bitcoin to go crazy could drive gold. If you are double leveraged through mining + options you could make crazy gains there as well.
Why not go in a bit of both?

I'm just going to get some popcorn and watch the markets on the 10th. I would be very surprised if i'm not surprised on that day. Lots of potential upside, lots of potential downside and potential for stabilization of the value. 
I've put lota of brainpower into thinking through the scenarios as well. End of the day, potential asymetric returns keep me hodling. I do try to take a long term perspective though :)

Futures represent regulation - I think there will be less foul play like you point out happening as the space becomes more regulated. However this could totally happen and traders could likely justify this exact move as regular trading.
Im very bullish on futures in the mid to long term as it may be the enabler of the amazons of the world to deal in it. If futures can limit volatility risk, there are suddenly many less barrier for big companies to for example accept bitcoin.

Split it up! 50/50 would be a better than 100% in either. Diversity is essential and you will get a broad exposure with both btc and xrp!

This is huge. We made it. We can now pay for moon tickets with our crypto.

1) Diversify
2) Buy and try not to look for a months
3) Assume that what you put in, is gone
4) If it goes 10x, take a quarter out to cover your costs
5) Back that shit up

I dig it completely. Ultimately i ended up taking some profits. It is quite the rabbit hole indeed. 
I startes with your same doubts, startes comparing btc to gold - started  doing a deep dive into the state of the global economy.. I could only conclude that cashing out from crypto conpletely was more risky then hodling only crypto.

This post only considers inflation; if you took this same British Pound and put it in a bank getting only 1.7% interest for the entire 317 years, it would still be worth 12oz of silver.
I'm not arguing that you are wrong, or that fiats are not overvalued. I am arguing that you would be better off putting pounds into a bank 317 years ago than putting silver under a mattress for 317 years.

We could be in for a correction or we could be seeing the start of institutional money coming in. To me, institutional money would go directly into Bitcoin as opposed to altcoins in order to tell an easier story.
At the end of the day, we can only lose 100% of what we invest but can gain a lot more. I'm personally willing to keep gambling. Har!

If I knew I would be in a yacht, not posting this reddit response! Happy gambling mate!

Nice find! Any other bitcoin related stocks you know of? All I can find is OTCQB:SMME - a company that has developed the technology for credit cards that need to be activated by fingerprint - this could blow up with the additional security requirements of cryptocurrencies?

There are ATMs in Major cities, some which you can deposit coins at as well. Although it does seem sketchy at times - one time I put my bitcoin in but the machine didn't work, so I tried calling the phone number listed on the machine but got no answer - luckily an unknown man came by and handed me a stack of cash so I shook his hand and walked off. It was an odd experience!
I'd thinking that if its not easy to sell in a few years (my investment horizon) then it probably won't be worth much then anyway..

I think the more regulation the better for the price. The general financier knows that blockchain is coming up but is also timid from the legal side. If the legal side of crypto is completely transparent, a lot more money would move into the space.

If you have any kind of transaction fees, I'd do it all in one go.

Diversify, diversify, diversify. Depending on your risk tolerance you can put some savings into cryptocurrencies, but know there is a huge risk in this space. I wouldn't put all my money into a single "risk category" ever.
It wouldn't hurt you to buy some stocks on the stockmarket as well. One potential option would be to put 20% into weed stocks, 20% into a water ETF, 20% into bitcoin stocks. Then you could put the rest directly into a few different cryptocurrencies ect.
TLDR. DIVERSIFY!
