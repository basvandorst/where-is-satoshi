Well, with my CSI image-enhancing technology I just made the CD transparent. Will take the bitcoins later, feeling sleepy right now.

Oh my... now I activated changetip! What a great thing and thank you very much!

Oh... you're right, thanks! Too much excitement :D
I put it in the first post.

Good to have you here!

"Fuck Hodling! I'm China.
Never underestimate my power."
To be honest I fear this will not be the last BTC related rumour from China.

Well, fuck PayPal. Closed my account months ago.

Yeah I saw these, but my paper wallet will just be kept somewhere safe at home and my printers paper does'nt fold very well anyway ;)
Speaking of printers: Take care of your used color foils if you use some kind of thermo printer - in theory someone could search your trash and read your private key on the different colored foils.

Now this seems interesting at first look, got to read it in detail tonight.

It was worth it ;)

Even with just some mBTC to my name I can't resist watching graphs, reddit threads and related news. If you really own 500BTC you must have giant balls of steel to ignore the whole shit for a year, Sir!

Yes, good point. Maybe my next design will be one to fold. This way I'll also be forced to design a nice flipside :)

Thank you!

Oh even more to read, have not heard of changetip yet. Thanks!
