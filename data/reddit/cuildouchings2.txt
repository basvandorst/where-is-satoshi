My guess is that you more probably got rekt in there for **praxxing** that can't solve our problems. 
Which is kinda the same as claiming it, but then ducking and running for cover the moment that somebody starts asking for any kind of formal model or empirical results.

OP should probably notice that around 10 to 20% of that sub's front page has been somehow about bitcoin for the past 3 weeks, instead of asking why HIS bit of btc-related content in particular got ignored. 
Maybe....people are just tired of reading the same story over and over?

Not entirely. It's the methodology which is popular among a certain subset of austrian thinkers. 
Basically, it comes down narrative-dependent analysis. It's like reading a working paper, except with the explicit exclusion of formal modeling and equations (so, without formally saying what is being assumed (or not) to describe in detail any sort of causal relationships being claimed, and also with the explicit exclusion of any sort of empiricism or historical analysis. 
It's all formal narrative logic based on lemmas and axioms instead.

Foreign currency markets didn't exist prior to 1945?
Speculation didn't happen on them?

That's easy. Just simultaneously mandate no currency growth and no GDP growth. 
The people might take to their pitchforks though.

I don't. 
When was that? You must be a very elderly person.

Not sure. 
But if we could go back to the time when currency speculation didn't exist. How long ago was that?
 We're basically talking about the times predating the Italian Renaissance here.

Maybe they DIDN'T panic sell. 
If you wanna cash-out, you gotta sell. right?
