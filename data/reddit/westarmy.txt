Yeah my bad read it completely incorrectly...
Look like such a fool.
Researched into it further and found a useful site if anyone is worried:

~~UK Government has clarified that any form of trading in Crypto is tax-free.~~
In regards to banks, when you signed up you accepted a policy agreement and from time to time they update this and ask you to read it. I suggest you read it and find what it may state about cryptocurrency.
The best way to avoid and escape if banks are being the corrupt cunts they are is open a Revolut account. Fund it with X amount and then use that to buy cryptos on exchange
I'm with Barclay's and don't have any issues.

Are you guys reading what I'm reading? 
Unless I'm reading it wrong, we are exempt from VAT.

They just opened a Barclays bank account.
What's special about that? Nothing.

I don't keep up with Elon, I should read up on this to be honest. But I always thought he's a rich guy just playing with his toys.

What's wrong with TRON?
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:41:45
I wouldn't say he's a scam artist.
I'd just say he's a rich guy who is playing with his money to create expensive toys and tries to make out he's some sort of innovator and revolutionary.
The majority of work is done by those behind the scene.

Not. A. Partnership.
Just opened a bank account with Barclays.
Clickbait to the MAX.
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:54:57
Basically the way phishing works is aiming at as many people as you possibly could and hoping someone takes the bait... Hence the term phishing. 
Let me provide an example, say you have Gmail. 
You receive a text staying your account has been compromised, use this link to login.
You go on to the link and you login.
What you've actually done is enter your username and password as though you're about to login but in actual fact you've just sent them to the scammer.
With that text you received... Click on the link you'll probably see a URL that has nothing to do with coinbase. And also likely if you type in a random username and password it may not work or redirect you to a Google search saying "I look at child porn".

Because most people are in it for the gains. Honestly I doubt more than 5% of people care about the tech.

Dear lord I'm confusing myself.
I'll have to have a re-read into this.

The fooks going on here?
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:07:52
Environmental consequences with regards to cryptocurrency is mute compared to banking systems and super computers.
Is even more mute when you have companies like Shell who actively pay off politicians and hire mercenaries to kill people.
It's even more mute when America, Russia etc are dropping bombs.
Shall we go on?

It's a joke with reference to a girl claiming to have developed an app with regards to bitcoin markets and emphasising she's 16 etc.
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:08:23
Are you 16?
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:03:50
Not like the population grew exponentially :D
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:56:44
I misread OP. Forgive me for I have sinned. I was thinking after WW2 they had economic sanctions and population growth.

I think I pissed off a scammer trying to phish for my HMRC (tax) login. I wrote in the login box the following:
As soon as I clicked login the page just went to the official HMRC website... Giving the idea if the user tries again it will work.
I got the exact same email again a few days later from the same scammer. Did it again and instead of redirecting me to HMRC website he redirected me to a search of "I had sex with an 8 year old".
This was at Uni on University computers. You probably can guess how horrified I felt. I assume they may have tried it on others that took the bait and terrified them from telling anyone what happened especially the elderly.
Also I wouldn't recommend on clicking on it but it's unlikely it will do anything. You can enter crap into the page if you so wish.
