How much was the transaction fee that you included?

Nice fit. I hope you make a billion satoshis a day.
I believe you can list your service here also:

It's hard to keep track of nothing because there's more nothing than something.

Satoshi probably runs one of the big pools. As satoshi is now a very wealthy man and his network is thriving, I wonder how he could consider his project a failure.

This is awesome! Many thanks. Got a bitcoin address?

The government outlawed drugs. Drugs are now one of the world's biggest money magnets.
Imagine what would happen if government tried to outlaw money? They'd be saying their money is no good, which would drive the value of the outlawed money through the roof while driving the value of the dollar into the dirt. 
The Feds will never touch Bitcoin except to buy as much as they can.

It's already doing that. : )

Go ahead and put that together. If anyone is interested, they'll join you.


I don't want them either. As Bitcoin matures, people will develop tools to protect themselves. 
Central banks enagage in fraud, theft, murder and other crimes as a matter of policy. Should Bitcoin, or a currency superior to it, grow to a point that central banks are made more irrelevant, central bankers will have to join the ranks of any common Bitcoin scammer in order to operate. 
That would be a blessing for all of us.

Roger that. Any eta on implementation?

Will they be shutting down all of these alternative currencies also?:
The Feds would have a sticky wicket on their hands if tried to publicly  move against Bitcoin. Instead, they'll attempt pull their usual covert  methods. This will be hard to do with a crypto currency but it will be amusing watching them contort themselves as Bitcoin continues to produce 25 bitcoins for every block found, no matter what the powers that be think of it.
There are some things governments are powerless to stop. Ideas are at the top of that list. They'll never win against this idea.

It's a bot. It's been operating since October:
If you follow the trail of how that address got funded, it leads to other SatoshiDice bots. 
SD runs some of these bots to generate winning address as come-ons to unsuspecting players. I'm sure there are others that have their own bots in order to win by playing the percentages on a micro-level. 
Nonetheless, SD spams the blockchain and takes bitcoins from the gullible. The house always wins.

It's how casinos operate in Las Vegas and elsewhere. They hire house "winners" to get others to play.
Or are you claiming that SatoshiDice is run by a pack of clueless newbies that wouldn't institute professional casino techniques in some of its design?
