Bitcoin Under the Hood is the best video I've seen yet that explains it very well and without getting ahead of itself.

I wonder how difficult it is to incorporate. Could my friends and I form a corporation and then enjoy all the benefits and exemptions they enjoy?

True, but maybe we can form something like "The People, inc" and just allow anyone to be part of our executive board, and just form a massive corporation that does nothing but highlight the ridiculousness of corporate privilege. 
It's nice to dream sometimes.

It was in the OP, but he said charge a minimum fee for each output, rather than just for each transaction. So here, instead of just costing $.08, it would cost $2.72 ($.08*34, where 34 is the number of outputs). 
Not a lot for a one-off, but you probably wouldn't want to spam the network over and over at that cost.

No worries, we all start somewhere. Asking questions is the first step to learning. Even if you end up turning away, thinking it's all a bunch of hogwash, you still educated yourself. Something far too few people do nowadays. 
The really bizarre thing (at least for me) to realize is that fiat currencies like the US Dollar aren't even backed by a physical asset. Do it's even less of a leap to create a currency out of thin air.

I must say, I go over to several times a day the past month or so, and I've not seen one if those posts on the front page yet.

Interesting given his views on the Internet.

I've encountered this sentiment with my friends as well. My rebuttal is usually, how much of your money is actual cash and how much really is just numbers in an account somewhere? Most money is already just magic Internet numbers anyway. 1000 bits.

I don't understand anything about how currency works (why is this slip of paper worth $1? $1 of what? Why? Says who?) and the cons side helped me understand... And yeah. Fuck that. I'd much prefer Bitcoin.

The inclusion of ads was the last straw for me. And that Delta Search bullshit.

If it works for the bad guys...

Just getting into Bitcoin, this is a whole new world to me, and pretty exciting!
