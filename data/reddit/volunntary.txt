So you dont think you should run your own life? Or do you think you should be running other peoples lives?
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:15:32
Well we dismiss your professors of finance and economics. Plus bitcoin isn’t meant to be a traditional investment.

Yes enable it! Also you should know that leaving coins on coinbase is risky. If they get shut down or hacked your coins are gone.

If you had all those millions why even fuck with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:12:46
Only 10k? Are you even trying bro?

The days of 2000% gains are gone but you can still probably get a better return than holding onto USDs.

I dont think you know what anarchy means. Please educate yourself.

No unfortunately I didn't do a backup. But there wasn't too much in there so I dont mind waiting
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:09:10
All right makes sense with the influx of interest im sure they are busy.

Dont feel too bad when I first got into Bitcoin I got addicted to Satoshi dice and lost everything.

What you did is called [tilting]( Consider this a lesson learned.

Not really because a ruler must ruler through force. Bitcoin is voluntary no one is forced to partake.

I thought this was a joke when I read the title. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:28:11
I just don't understand what they do with the code. I thought bitcoin was hardcoded why would we need them?
@_date: 2013-07-29 02:35:35
You’re leaving out supply+demand.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:12:02
Well in theory you're supposed to gain money from interest.
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:22:53
I am well aware of the social contract. It doesnt exist. [You Should study up on it.](
@_date: 2013-05-26 18:54:29
That shit was a total failure, why did u want  me to read that?
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:28:52
Also what is their incentive and do they get paid for their work?

Well just look at bitcoin it’s a perfect example. is there a single ruler over bitcoin? **NO**. Are there rules? Yes, and they are not guidelines they are strict enforceable rules, such as you cant withdraw more funds than what your wallet contains etc... We can do the same thing with any aspect of society. Just because government currently has a monopoly over something doesn’t mean the issue couldnt be dealt with in a better more peacful way. When people say they dont want government or other violent monopolies doing something (schools, roads, Arbitration etc…) it dosn’t meant they don't want those things done. We can figure out a way to do those things without using the force of a ruler or a representative or what ever you want to call the violence of your rulers. 
But other ways of having rulers without rulers is simply by having contracts and insurance. Think of ebay and how important reputation is. Same thing could be done in a peaceful society without rulers. There would be rules and contracts and if you broke them then you would only be damaging yourself and people would be less likly to do bussiness and your insurance rates would go up and you would end up paying far more in the long run for being dishonest. Of course this is hypothetical but on a small scale it works and it would work on a larger scale but people are mainly too ignorant, and immature, and continue to vote for tyrants and support dictators. Check out for more info on how a peaceful society could work.

Anarchy means without **rulers**, not without *rules*. I expect the word to be used correctly here of all places. Bitcoin is anarchy in the sense there is no ruler or centralized agency controlling it. Check out for more info.
