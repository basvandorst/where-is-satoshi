I think it's always been there.

Here's a bit of wisdom.
Don't mine bitcoin. 
You're welcome.

Since crypto is unregulated, is it wrong to insider trade?  I guess it's more of an ethical question versus a legal one in this relm, right?

I'm in US, but I've been using Binance to buy the more obscure altcoins with Bitcoin I transfer from GDAX.  So far I've had an excellent experience with Binance.  I got level 2 verified in about 12 hours.  All trades/deposits/withdrawals happen very fast.  I would recommend them based on my own experience.

They do not deal with USD, I believe.  Level 2 verification allows you to withdraw up to 100 BTC versus 2 BTC (I think) with only Level 1.  But 2 BTC is nearly $40,000 so if you aren't playing with big money then don't worry about any verification.  I normally get verification on these sites in case I had a coin go up enough that I would need level 2 (unlikely, but just in case).

I personally think cryptocurrency technologies (current and future-as-yet-uncreated) will change the world in regards to the paradigms they apply to.  But as far as any specific crytocurrency goes, I have so little invested that I don't really care which one fails or succeeds.  I would think that Bitcoin will always be the biggest, most important crypto, much like Ford (creating the automobile) or Microsoft/Apple/Google/Amazon in their respective markets.  I'm pretty diversified with my small funds in cryto, and hopefully one will continue to make great gains through the years.  I do think some people take it too far when they are "cult-like" regarding a specific crypto.

The only minimum I've found on Binance was purchasing on the exchange (minimum .001 BTC purchase for any specific coin).  I would just create an account and look around their documentation for any minimum on withdrawals or deposits.  I haven't had any issue, and I only work with small amounts (USD-wise).

Here's the key: document everything.  If you notify your bank ahead of time that you will be depositing 10 grand and report everything to IRS when you file your taxes (or if they contact you immediately), then any holds on your money will be lifted quickly.  This is scalable.  If you sold 100 million dollars of Bitcoin on GDAX and had a 25 million daily withdrawal limit, you could make 4 transfer of 4 days to deposit that money into a bank account.  As long as you have documentation of how you bought the Bitcoin and sold it, and notify the bank and IRS ahead of time before the transfer happens, then you will not have much problem.  Think about all the people who sell businesses and other such assets for millions of dollars and then have to get it through a bank before investing it into other assets.  Wealthy people don't have problems with the banks closing their accounts or the IRS raiding their home, etc. etc.  Be smart like them.  Document everything and research on who you need to help you with the transfer of wealth.

Maybe Gemini?  I haven't used them, but there fees seem reasonable.

For people needing to move a lot of Bitcoin (more than 25 coins), ItBit has an OTC desk that will help you do that.  ItBit is a registered, FDIC-insured bank in New York, as well as a registered trust company in New York.  Go read up on their security (everything cold storage) and insurance (both for fiat and crypto assets); it's quite robust.

For the love of all that is holy, please do not waste your money on performance parts for a Nissan Z (or any car).  I had a buddy who was always obsessed with the old 300z twin turbos, and I spent a week with him at Z1 Motorsports while he paid them a ton of money to do shit to that car.  The engine blew up a year later.  Total waste of money and one of the biggest financial regrets for my friend.  If you are exorbitantly rich, disregard all I've written.

I put in a very small amount into Tron when it was $0.003 (a fraction of a penny) which yielded quite a few TRX.  So I am very happy with my penny coin!  It also makes me think back to the beginning of Bitcoin where you could have spent $20 for 10,000 BTC (just like the first pizzas bought with BTC).

You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin.  You can buy as little as you want ($5, $10, $50, whatever you want).
