I'm from oz  - some people here have posted letters from banks about "transactions not allowed" and threats to freeze or close accounts. This only began  in the last 2-3 weeks.

asap on any exchange with best price, medium/long term there's maybe some trading potential now it's on coinbase - but short term many people are getting ready to dump it and there's plenty of people ready to buy it at high prices atm.

There's been reports about this from most major banks here

Probably best to store significant amounts of major coins off exchanges

Don't worry this is a short term event, wait a day or two and things will settle down again. Besides 16k is a support level for Bitcoin, it seems to be holding there now and many people have been waiting for this dip and will buy in at this price, pushing the price back up.
