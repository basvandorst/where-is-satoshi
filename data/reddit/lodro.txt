Haha.  I find it quite believable for most companies (especially any one that I've worked for).

I seriously doubt that's where the downvotes come from.
Perhaps gossip was too strong a word - but I doubt I would have been spared the downvotes if I had just called it a lousy primary source.
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:59:03
Well, all kinds of things are possible.  Mere possibility accompanied with a couple sentences of gossip hardly merit a front-page article.

Yeah, usually middle managers aren't a big deal at a huge corporation like that.  People often become a middle manager by accident, just by doing their job reasonably well and staying at the company for a few years.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:07:05
Huh...well, what you said is true, but you're using this phrase "like every company" in a very different way than I meant.
I did not mean "Google is a wonderful good company where nobody makes mistakes."  I meant "Google is an unusually successful company."  That is true.  It also suggests that they have overcome some problems that other companies have not.
Apparently doesn't like that fact stated.
Sigh...echo chambers.

Google is not like most companies; it is an exceptional company (i.e. it is an outlier).  I would not expect major decisions at Google to be based on the personal preferences of relatively junior employees such as middle managers.
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:51:12
In that thread, it was strongly implied that there was a middle manager whose *personal* views about bitcoin were causing Google as a company to avoid innovation involving Bitcoin.  I did not find that particularly believable.
What you're suggesting is quite different (a senior decision carried out by a middle manager), and much more believable.
@_date: 2015-06-03 05:17:10
I don't see how it's relevant whether I've worked for a difficult middle manager or not, but for the record, I have (and I've been one).  I'm not saying that this never happens - just that I seriously doubt it is happening in this case.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:27:28


Hmm...I don't believe that it could be so extreme.  Google's initial success was about 15 years ago, and most of their growth occurred over the next decade after that.  It seems to me that they have demonstrated much more than successfully executing their early ideas.
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:34:06
Google is a profoundly successful, massive multinational corporation.  I don't find it plausible that their decision making process about working with Bitcoin could possibly be this simplistic.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:13:08
If I read that same primary source in an article by the New York Times (or whatever secondary source you like) I would think it was a crap article.  It's just gossip, no matter who delivers it.
It's like reading a "news article" on Reddit whose sole source is a post on Reddit from last week.  Who cares?

I have no idea - I don't know Mike, and there was almost no content in the link about the Google claim...

of work Googlers could do on it. I had to repeatedly go over his head in order to get 
bitcoinj released and most employees simply aren't willing to engage in that kind of 
corporate politics.”
Is all I could find.  Seems highly improbable, and there is no evidence offered.  Perhaps Mike is lying; perhaps Mike is mistaken; perhaps Mike is very naive about management practices, and is honestly reporting an experience that is badly distorted by that naivete.  Who knows?
  I honestly don't understand why this thread exists; it should have been downvoted into oblivion as a crap source, as far as I'm concerned.

Google remains an outlier.  I'm not saying they're the best company ever, or that their business practices are admirable, or anything like that.  I'm saying that they are unusually successful, in a tier above most other companies in terms of *success*.

That's not what vakeraj said at all.  Your addresses can be publicly viewed, but you can use the bitcoin in them without connecting your actual economic activity with an address that is publicly linked to your identity.  It isn't difficult to do that, either.
If you kept all your bitcoin in one address, and used that address every time you shopped, then your statement would be accurate.  That is not the intended use.
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:14:45
It'd be fairly straightforward to integrate the output of a btc client with financial or other record keeping software.  Beats physical inventory...

It's easy to condemn people over the internet from the comfort of your home, or on your phone as you go freely about your day.
I saw the contradictions in his letter, too.  But how can I hate this person for regretting actions that have put him through the last year and a half of imprisonment and trial, and which will now take at least the next twenty years from him?
That is incredibly cold, and incredibly naive.  You should go commit some non-violent crime that puts you in jail for a month, and then see if you can still be so callous.

It depends on how strictly the law will apply.  Would any business with California customers have to get a license, or would it only apply to businesses with a physical presence in California?
If it is the former case, then we can expect a ton of businesses to simply deny service to California.
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:25:46




Not true at all - given your first assumption, splitting your risk simply guarantees your loss.  If you have two friends, each of whom went all in on either BTC or fiat, you'll lose more than one and less than the other in the end.
Your reasoning only works in a model that averages across large groups of individuals.  Any particular individual will certainly have losses and gains as a result of their decisions.
@_date: 2015-07-11 06:56:14
Depends on how you look at it.  You can't deny that there was a period of massive growth in the 1990s that had very little to do with military spending.
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:27:48
Huh...well, I guess that's one way to go about arguing a point. :/
The initial permission you're referencing in no way contradicts the permissionless innovation idea - after that (blanketed and unconstrained) permission was granted, there was no need for individuals to ask permission before implementing a new idea.  Anybody with $ could start a web-based business with almost no regulatory overhead.
That the internet developed out of ARPAnet, etc, is no contradiction to that.

I pretty much agree with your analysis, but reject the conclusion that only idiocy can explain David Cameron's position on encryption.
Politicians often push for legislation that they know will not pass, and which they do not want to have pass.  They may wish to force other politicians to commit to opposing the legislation; they may wish to create apparent evidence of their deeply held political convictions.  They may wish to distract public or political attention from some unrelated topic.  They may wish to pass related legislation that is less extreme or more nuanced.  Etc.
I think it is much more likely that David Cameron's position is simply disingenuous.

I think the comment was highly relevant.  But I suppose we wouldn't be able to agree about that.
Usually when something is unoffensive but irrelevant, it just sinks with  few up or downvotes.  It seems very unlikely to me that the comment would get 10+ downvotes simply due to a perception of irrelevance.

So far, none of this conversation has been quantitative except my $.35 btc.
In economics, supply and demand are often represented as functions of price.  This is where the common visual of supply and demand curves intersecting comes from.  Supply at various prices and demand at various prices are plotted in one coordinate plane; the intersection point is a theoretical equilibrium, a price at which the two should be equal.
Perhaps in the future, bitcoin will be supremely useful, but only a tiny amount of coin will be needed to make complete use of it.
In this future, one would expect an equilibrium price to be quite low relative to a future in which bitcoin's utility was as a direct currency instrument.  You could call this "low-demand," though I think it would be better to think of it in terms of price.  People might buy it all the time!  But it would not cost much.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:56:02


What do you mean by success, though?  If you keep buying because you believe that you will profit in the end when BTC inevitably rises in price, then you are not a wise investor; there is no compelling reason to believe it will rise substantially again.
It seems to me that OP's most important insight above is that success for bitcoin does not necessarily require a high USD value.
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:51:22
Well...it seems that you've taken my plain, factual assessment that bitcoin makes illegal trade over the internet easier, and erroneously concluded from it that I think this means bitcoin should be destroyed.
This is exactly what I'm talking about!  This sub should not downvote people for saying things that are true about bitcoin, just because people are uncomfortable with these truths.
Similarly, we should not conflate statements of fact and their truth or falsity with statements of judgment about right or wrong, ought or ought not.
Bitcoin makes some illegal activities easier.  That is a simple statement of fact.  It isn't a judgment about what is good or bad, nor about what ought to be done.  It's like saying the Earth orbits the sun.  Whether that is good or bad depends on your point of view.
@_date: 2015-04-24 05:02:29
That isn't true at all.  You can't use 1040EZ unless your income is extremely straightforward.  You can't use it with dependents.  You can't use it with self-employment income - even if it is quite small (e.g. a one-off contracting gig). 
There's no way 9/10 taxpayers are using that form.
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:25:24
You have given an uncharitable characterization of what I have said, and then argued against that characterization.
Most people are anti-drug (in that they reject hard drugs and endorse their illegality), and most people are ambivalent about bitcoin (in that they are unfamiliar with it).
It would be a good thing if this sub had some decent answers for those people.  If I were anti-drug and knew nothing about bitcoin, and voiced my concerns about bitcoin and drug crime on here, I would expect to be turned away and not have my concerns taken seriously.  That would leave me with a bad impression of bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-15 06:36:14


Perhaps that is true, and means something, but I don't see how it has any relevance to what I've said above.
What is Bitcoin worth if it makes the internet 10x valuable as it is currently?  Well, nobody knows.  I think that's one of the main points of the OP.
Perhaps the next phase of bitcoin is to become so profoundly useful for everyday transactions that it transforms life as we know it and we reach a singularity hive mind consciousness that explodes the fucking galaxy into a cosmic mindfuck jism explosion of funkadelic sex magic, while also being worth about 35 cents apiece.
In that case, it would have been a pretty shit investment despite all its utility, as in this scenario the utility of bitcoin for any particular person is independent of the magnitude of that person's bitcoin holdings.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:07:12


If this were true, then all commodities whose price ever rose substantially and then fell should exhibit infinite cycles of substantial growth and decay.
But they don't... :/
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:37:18
That is an interesting point of view, but it is irrelevant to this particular conversation.  Vlarocca was talking about investments, and I am curious about Vlarocca's reasons for investing as they seem to believe there is some compelling reason to expect a high return.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:52:10
Yes, those are all fair points.
I find this interesting, in particular:


My understanding is that there are many commodities that offer a much more predictable return.  There are also many other potential tech investments with an uncertain fate.
If your goal is profit, investing heavily in Bitcoin makes little sense.  Bitcoin is not special in this regard; it is a risky investment that has its place, but should not be expected to pay off huge just because it possibly could.
@_date: 2015-04-15 09:30:22
If you believe that an idea about supply and demand contradicts the possibility of bitcoin being profoundly useful for everyday transactions and also dirt cheap, then we probably disagree about supply and demand.  I'm quite comfortable with that. :P
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:57:25
I'm not talking about conservatives - most liberal people think hard drugs should be illegal in some form.  Not to mention other forms of crime that could be aided by bitcoin!  It's as though you believe that the views of the vast majority of people don't matter - that bitcoin will do just fine if only a tiny minority of libertarian tech enthusiasts use it.
I don't buy it.
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:06:56
The supply is decreasing?
Are you sure you're not thinking of the rate of bitcoin creation?
edit:  I also took an econ course or two in school.  It is not so simple and straightforward to apply elegant quantitative laws of supply and demand to real life.  In that context, you do not actually know the supply, demand, or even the price of Bitcoin with precision.  Economics, like science, is math.  If you can say it in English without referring to a chart full of numbers, it's not economics.  It's not science.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:20:51
You should consider how other people see this, though.
Some people think that bitcoin is more advantageous than cash or credit/banking systems for those involved in criminal activity.  In their view - which may well be correct - fiat currency and bitcoin are **not equivalent** in their potential to serve criminal ends.
Beyond that, not everybody thinks that these crimes should be solved by changing the law to make them not crimes.  Actually, most people think that things like human trafficking and hard drug sales should be illegal.
So perhaps you don't care and think this is all stupid - but that's hardly going to help spread the good news of bitcoin, is it?
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:36:35


What are you talking about?  By your language, it sounds like you're equating creation rate with supply.  Is that right?
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:03:39

This is a self-defeating attitude, though.  If ignores facts about bitcoin that reflect negatively on it from a mainstream perspective, and ostracizes those who express those facts, it merely serves as an echo chamber for a small slice of potential bitcoin enthusiasts.
This limits the potential of to serve newcomers, and makes the community appear distasteful.

Did you read the OP?  It seems like a reasonable assessment to me:


@_date: 2015-04-16 09:21:50
The miners are not responsible for anybody's bitcoin, though.  It's not the same.
If they mine, they get new coins.  If they don't, they don't.  If they mine incorrectly, they don't.  But they have no liability as a result of anybody else's coins.
A better analogy would be a bitcoin exchange; if you keep bitcoin in an exchange, that entity likely has a liability as a result of your asset.  The difference, then, is that one can easily use and hold bitcoin without using a liable intermediary (like an exchange).
