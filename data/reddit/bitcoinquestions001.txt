Idk about the bunny, but the confederate flag is *the* battle flag for those fighting the Federal government. What is Bitcoin, if not a declaration of war against the Fed? Federally funded schools are basically mandated to teach that the flag is a symbol of the KKK or some similar lie; the people in power always try to rewrite history.

Bitcoin will not prosper from a recession. During a recession people horde their money because they feel poor. Bitcoin does well when the fiat economy does well; it's like an economic sponge that soaks up all of the success of fiat.

You don't have any bitcoin in your IRA, the owner of a bitcoin is the person with sole control of the private keys. If this concept escapes you, stick to fiat.

and for good reason: 1 person 1 vote is retarded; when bitcoin takes over ze world the new establishment will likely be keeping this policy and just make it public knowledge; not some stupid whispery secret amongst "elites" with the toilette paper that they call money.

Think about this for a moment. If you _truly_ believe in bitcoin, such to the point that you're willing to put together an advertisement for it, what is your best play right now? Really, take a second to think. Is it to spend _any_ money on convincing others that they should start buying bitcoins? Why on earth would you want to convince the fools who are willing to part with their coins for ~$230 and give them to you that they should hold them instead? Remember, it currently only costs ~$20 million to clear the _entire_ order book.

Not voting is as equally useless as voting. If all you do to support your favored candidate is vote you don't change anything unless the election was a tie and your vote was the tipping point to dispute this tie. 
Now many people who follow the popular bipartisan view of "get out and vote!" will say that although you are only one in a small group it's important you go out and vote so that your voice is heard. But if you look at it with a game theory mindset you realize that your individual decision to not vote will have an infinitely small chance to swing the election.
So then the question becomes how to swing the election in a more significant way. Well, your best bet would be to not only vote but convince other people to also vote for your candidate. In fact, if you spent a large amount of effort convincing people to vote for your candidate as long as you got two to do it you would be doing better than the person who was quiet and silently voted for the person he believed in. 
So now there are two kinds of people you can convince to go out and vote. One kind of person is a person who believes in your campaign. If you get them to vote your candidate gets one point. If you convince a person who would have otherwise voted for the opposing candidate you get two points (you not only gained a vote but you took one away from the opposing candidate.) If you accidentally convince a person to vote for the opposing candidate you lose a point.
Since it's hard to convince people to switch their opinions and therefore nearly impossible to get the bonus point person of switching their views the best way to influence an election is to find the greatest number of people who would already vote for your candidate and make sure they show up at the polls. So one can logically conclude that your best bet is to fund go out and vote campaigns that hit a targeted audience of people who have the opinion that your candidate is the best (most likely using large datasets acquired by the likes of a power company that holds a lot of information (i.e. major search engines, FB, etc)).
And to fund those campaigns you need money. You need to advertise the "get out and vote!!!" campaign very loudly to only a very targeted audience which takes effort. This is one point where money comes into politics and it is why this *does* belong in because bitcoin is a new type of money.
TL;DR It's worth reading...
@_date: 2014-11-30 23:14:28
The number of bitcoins is not a very important decision to make because it does not matter in any way shape or form. The only thing that matters is what portion of the total supply does a person own at any given time. So yes as you said the arbitrary units were probably decided based on the easiest way to code them.
The distribution, however, is an important decision and one could make many arguments as to why we should use another distribution system.
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:18:00
This is indeed a major problem with Bitcoin and a reason I'm beginning to think Proof of Stake may be where crypto-currencies are headed. Not only could a wealthy nation state take over by buying the necessary mining equipment, but they also could take over by bombing  / raiding and stealing existing mining operations' equipment.
This may seem ridiculous now, but people will go to great lengths to protect their seat on the throne.
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:26:53
Yes there is a theoretical weakness - a quantum computer can theoretically derive the private key from the public key. That being said, if you spent the coins properly you would send them back to a change address with a new public / private key pair so that should not be an issue. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 17:14:31
I feel the younger generation is going to really lead the way with bitcoin innovation. They believe they deserve to transact like adults and now they will have the power to, regardless of whether or not a bank wants to service them / give them an account.

Saying an attacker cannot reverse transactions is not true! Use your noggins instead of reading the wiki that everyone here seems to treat like a bible.
Suppose I have 51% of the hashing power of the network and I begin mining a private blockchain without notifying anyone of my private fork. All of the confirmations that the network receives starting at that point now are in jeopardy because my blockchain will be longer than the entire networks. I can at any point publish my blockchain and orphan hundreds of blocks thereby reversing all of the transactions that were in those blocks.
Of course, it would be very obvious that someone was doing secret mining due to the large number of orphaned blocks, but this tactic would almost completely destroy the integrity of the entire network.

This is so simple and clever and why I love this community. Smart little math tricks that will change the way we do finance forever :). I'll probably store some coins this way.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:53:56
What you're describing though is a scenario where miners hard fork Bitcoin and create a new currency. As long as no one updates their software to support their new currency instead of bitcoin the Bitcoin blockchain marches on.
The only fear, then, is that the miners who want to force people to switch to their new currency begin to perform a 51% attack on the Bitcoin blockchain to encourage people to switch over to their new currency.
My conclusion: Bitcoins by definition have a 21 million unit supply that can *never* change. However, the integrity of the Bitcoin currency can be destroyed through a constant 51% attack in such a way that a new currency emerges which has a different supply than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:48:10
And a bitcoin fractional reserve. As long as not everyone tries to withdraw their coins at once they will continue to operate smoothly.

Yeah I wrote my brother a card and gave him the private key hand written to some bits. Demonstrating that you could do a handwritten letter to give someone coins is pretty cool. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:27:56
haha no problem, good job getting through the challenge. A blockchain would be a good solution to give recent work extra value, and we could archive all the news in the blockchain. A 51% attack could rewrite history o.O. I would also like to build an easy interface for people to choose which link they wanted to upvote and then have their computers "mine" for that link. I also would want to make this app downloadable and not hosted on a web server, it would be a peer-to-peer network that was just for news. If there was incentive for mining for truthful and worth-while news articles, this could be a great way to find good content.

Yes it's only temporary but it does happen. It also may happen at random points that are not correlated to a specific increase in demand. For example maybe a new mining company creates a new faster way to mine coins from some new hardware chip. Although the invention of a new chip could be considered a demonstration of an increase in demand

It's not "odds are there will never be anymore." There will never be anymore. This is because Bitcoin by definition has only 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Sure, someone may start trading a currency with a higher supply that is similar to Bitcoin but they would not be trading bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:50:40
I don't think putting 50% of your stored wealth in bitcoin is 'exceedingly daring' (at least not for OP given his described life scenario - it is definitely a risky investment.) That being said, Bitcoin is almost objectively the best money the world has known since gold.

I feel like I'm beating a dead horse but this x100. I think it's really important that all wallets have this feature so that users are aware that this can be done to them. It would be horrible if only a few bitcoin "experts" knew about this and they took advantage of the general public who are unaware. This needs to be created asap so there's not a lot of infrastructure built that ignores this vulnerability. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:30:08
man this COMPLETELY changes my opinion of bitcoin. I was always thought that rule was such a dumb limitation.
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:44:08
The only thing he's right about in his whole article is that bitcoin rewards early adopters disproportionality. This is part of the incentive mechanism to get people to join "the game." Put all morals aside, if early adopters didn't have a large prize the system would not have been bootstrapped. Satoshi had a great understanding of human psychology and economics that is demonstrated by his decisions in the distribution mechanism.
Anyways- Blood, sweat, and tears have been put in by the early bitcoin folk to get bitcoin where it is today. They deserve every satoshi they have.

"It's only real utility is illegal commerce."
I'm not sure how much you know about bitcoins but here are a few things you can do with it that you can't do with other systems:
1. Send money anywhere in the world instantly for little to no cost.
2. Store your wealth safe from inflation.
3. Buy goods online without paying a fee to a payment processor or revealing personal information.
4. Donate directly to a cause you care about - and be able to watch how the money you send them is moved around.

@_date: 2014-09-19 19:37:25
No benefits to the average consumer? Let me list a few:
1. Increased security and anonymity.
2. Users can buy anything with bitcoin as long as someone, somewhere in the world with an internet connection is willing to sell them that good. This allows the average good guy Joe who's sick to be able to buy medicinal weed without having to deal with a sketchy drug dealer on the street.
3. Protection against mandated inflation.

If you're looking at bitcoin from an investment standpoint, you don't need to worry about the fact that the masses currently do not care about bitcoin. At all. Only big players move markets.
The majority of wealth is held by a very small minority of people.  If you tried to move the price up by convincing 1 million uneducated and poor people to take a $1,000 dollar position in it - you're going to be very unsuccessful. However, if you were able to convince one educated wealthy person (ie. Bill Gates, Tim Draper, etc.) to take a billion dollar position in Bitcoin you've just done the equivalent work of convincing a million people to invest $1,000.

Was about to have my head explode from frustration after reading this comment. Then googled what slash s meant. Then laughed. Have 5000 bits @_date: 2014-05-19 21:24:00
Haha this comment really makes me think. Now, within seconds of meeting someone, you can verifiably prove that you are incredibly wealthy. This could cause some odd social behavior, especially with people who like to go to the club and show off their swagger with a bottle of cristal in the VIP section. 
That being said, I'm lucky (or unlucky lol) to have met my girlfriend two years ago before I owned any bitcoins.

Waiting ten minutes for a confirmation on a small purchase is akin to doing forensic analysis of a ten dollar bill when someone pays for their lunch. Yes, you may prevent the rare chance of counterfeit, but it's completely overkill for the transaction. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:09:11
Make them earn their bitcoins. Free money sounds like a scam. And DO NOT push too hard. It makes you sound really weird.
Whenever I do small transactions with my friends, I offer them bitcoins instead of dollars first. One story I have is going to a concert back when bitcoins were not worth so much. I had a friend-of-a-friend sell me a ticket, and I asked him how he would feel if I payed him in bitcoin.
He had heard a little bit about bitcoins, and he shrugged and said sure sounds interesting. A year later I met up with him (the concert was an annual event) and he was like "DUDE YOU ROCK! I MADE SO MUCH OFF SELLING YOU A TICKET!" If my dreams for bitcoin come true he's going to be a lot richer from that ticket than he could ever imagine. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 20:04:31
I would be interested if I didn't think it was technically infeasible. How do you prove someone is human? Even if you use captcha how do you prevent one person from doing your proof-of-sentience test twice?

It is not a smart decision but people new to bitcoin continuously do this. It's a pretty honest misconception to think that the address that sends the coin is the account of the user that you should use to return the coin. A company like Circle that prides itself on being a platform for main stream adoption should take into account this misconception.
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:28:36

Double spending itself won't be illegal, but double spending as an attempt to reverse a zero-confirmation transaction would be.

I'm actually not sure of the answer myself. My guess is that wealthy people know to start saving in smarter ways but the poor and uneducated do not. Also, if your poor you may need to have your money in cash because at a moments notice you may need to withdraw from your saving account. 
My guess is that the answer is basically people trapped in a work cycle where they can't ever get too much in their savings account to begin with.
@_date: 2014-09-25 15:59:57

Prices are rising.
Take note of everything you pay for and record the increase in price from year to year. If you notice a 10% increase in prices you can calculate how long it'll take for your money to be worth half as much as it use to be by using the rule of 72.
In our case of 10%, 72 / 10 ~ 7.2 years. If this doesn't bother you then go ahead and use fiat currency, no one is stopping you.

Indeed. I hope people on this subreddit reach out to their favorite high school math/econ/cs teachers and ask them if they are mentioning bitcoins or if students are asking about them. I think opening up the discussion of crypto-currencies to young people who have not yet chosen their method of banking will have a dramatic effect on the state of crypto-currencies 5-10 years from now.
@_date: 2014-10-01 19:11:14

@_date: 2014-11-03 01:49:40
Yes that could happen. Unless you have built the hardware yourself and written your own source code you are dependent on the developers and manufactures to not be attempting to steal your coins.
This is somewhat similar to how you trust your government to secure your funds - the key difference is the security in this case is publicly audible and verifiable. You can open up your trezor and look how it's wired and even read the source code on github. Anyone who discovers a flaw can make it public until a trusted issuer or a set of trusted issuers are identified that everyone chooses to use.

IMO it's just a big a catch 22. When the tech industry started booming women were kinda "kicked out" due to old traditional beliefs. Now, people are starting to become (somewhat) more progressive but since there are little to no women in tech, girls are choosing different career/school paths. And thus the cycle repeats itself. I hope you do take the time to promote bitcoin towards women so that everyone can see the advantages of using a crypto currency!
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:58:59
I see, so then what is the point of the private key? It seems like a smart user would never even reveal his public key for fear of an attack from a quantum computer that could solve for his private key.
@_date: 2014-10-09 06:21:59
Assume you had 51% of the computing power of the network. You could mine blocks normally and get 51% of the rewards or you could be nefarious and get 100% of the rewards.
What you do is you mine your own separate blockchain in secret (aka you don't publish to the network the blocks you've discovered.) Since you have so much computing power, your secret blockchain will become longer than the blockchain of the entire network. Then, once you have a nice fat chunk of rewards (say 10,000 blocks) you publish your blockchain that you kept in secret to the entire network. The entire network will have to orphan a huge chain and it would reverse many, many transactions.
The event I'm describing would be disastrous for the community. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:02:53


Yes the hash is only used to prove that the physical copy you have of the dictionary is a legitimate dictionary from that time.


How do you prove a digital record existed in the past without a timestamp server akin to the blockchain?


Okay so it seems you do get my overall point. We do decent in Latin and Greek because they are incredibly recent languages. We do mediocre with anything 10,000+ years back though (from my understanding). I'm thinking long term man. Also, as you said you are a professional in ancient languages. You may know how to read an ancient text because you've studied languages, with the blockchain it would make it easy for anyone to read and verify for themselves that they are reading ancient texts .
@_date: 2014-09-10 02:39:53
I'm in the same boat as you and just holding my long-term position. Fluctuations between 300-900 don't really mean too much to me. All I'm saying is that if I were day trading I would try to make some money off the sell pressure by taking a short position.

At fourteen, you have reached the age where everyone in the world wants to sell you something. Whether it's icecream, drugs, or a currency it's your job to figure out whether or not its worth it.
Millions of dollars go into research on how to convince consumers to buy a product. My own startup has used all of its funding on creating advertisement content. Convincing someone you have a good product is just as important if not more important than having a good product.
It's important that you understand this and devise your own way of determining how to find things to buy and/or invest in. Many people on this subreddit are "in" on the bitcoin game. They will tell you to buy bitcoins because that increases the value of the bitcoins they hold. 
It is great that you are considering bitcoin, because it means you're thinking way harder than most of the blind sheep who use fiat currency. But remember that bitcoin is an experiment, while fiat has lasted hundreds of years. 
Do your own research and find people you can trust who can give you guidance. I would recommend you talk to your teachers, they have devoted their lives to spreading knowledge.

That's exactly how I've been feeling - no one really talks about this. I'm techy so if I wanted to do something nefarious I could take the time to write these scripts, but I think we need to make it really easy for everyone to be able to double spend to raise awareness of this fundamental issue.

What do you think of a piece of software that took your bitcoin wallet and divided it up into paper bills that could be printed with any standard home printer. It would print the private key directly onto the bill. It's a way of making a very hot-wallet paper wallet. You have to keep your printed cash safe, but anyone who trusted you could accept it and you just let them know you have not cashed the bill. Merchants would take the bills and just use the private key to move the money to their own accounts on the spot, or they could just do it at the end of the day depending on how much they trusted their customer.

I agree. New merchants causes extra sell pressure because it gives more opportunities for hoarders to spend their bitcoins on a purchase. 
I think day traders are aware of this and then try to make money by shorting. Bitcoins value right now is mostly speculative so unless you have more people buying into the investment opportunity, bitcoin is going to be a successful bear's market with all these new merchants jumping on board.
All this being said I think long-term merchant adoption will drive the price up due to the increased visibility.

Your fear is completely rational. Think of all the terrible things that could undermine the validity of the network if a central miner got control They could block all transactions from parties as they choose. They could secretly mine and then orphan a large portion of the network. But keep in mind that this situation you're describing is fiat currency. At worst, bitcoin becomes akin to fiat currency where the election is whoever has the most mining power.

If I get some free time I'll try to implement this and post it.

It would have a little tooltip saying that undoing transactions is considered unethical and should only be done if the transaction was done by mistake.

This. The beauty of bitcoin is the answer to the questions "who is satoshi?", "was she a good person?", and "why did she build this?" will not alter bitcoin's future. This is different from other currencies where the answer to the questions "who controls the money supply?", "are they good people?", and "why did they get that power?" *will* determine the currencies' future.

You could say that about any good used to store value. Obviously if that happens, I will be out of luck. That being said, there are many reasons to believe BTC is the best way to store value and as long as many people think that the price will not decline as you describe.

I'm not trying to say that bitcoin isn't for the masses. It is, and I hope that everyone will be able to feel the benefits of a global decentralized currency.
I am able to appreciate bitcoin to its fullest only because I was extremely lucky and born into a family of (modest but significant) wealth that values education.
What I'm trying to say in my previous post is that the argument that bitcoin can't succeed because "normal" people can't read math proofs or understand how they work is silly. Bitcoin is useful for the people who use it regardless of whether or not other people use it. This is like saying telephones wouldn't be useful for people if only a few nerds used them. Telephones, like bitcoin, are more useful to have when more people use them, but they are useful no matter what. Bitcoin can be used to build a small economy by a few people who understand it while everyone else takes the time to learn. 
EDIT: Also, what are you saying about 'just building another Fed.'? This is a serious misconception, we are not building another economy based on the trust of a different entity. We are building another economy based on cryptographic proof.
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:10:50
@_date: 2014-12-25 23:25:59
Bitcoin does not need the support of the masses to succeed. Bitcoin is a closed system available only to those who own bitcoins. If it is only available to people who are able to read math proofs and have high disposable incomes than it may be better off because it will be an economy of only elites.
People who are intelligent and understand the necessity of having an honest ledger to do business will be able to build their own ecosystem. Bitcoin is not zero-sum.
This being said, the most likely thing to happen is that bitcoins will be so useful that people will join the network without understanding it. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 17:34:07
When generating a bitcoin receiving address, why do we do all this superfluous work?

I feel so lucky to be alive and have seen a math paper go from an idea to creating a billion dollar economy.

Increasing the max block size does not remove the incentive to pay fees. Miners don't need to include any transactions they don't want to, and they will simply ignore anything that does not have a fee attached to it.

Bitcoin's main advantage for the average Joe is that it is immune to wild inflation. People may not understand this for a while, but it will become very clear over time.

anyone who reads this should remember not to put all of their coins on this app. Coinbase is very convenient - and honestly it is *probably* fine to use for low amounts.
To answer the question: how much should I put on it? 
I would say the chance it is compromised is 1% So I consider myself "buying" the app at the price of the chance it is compromised. If I put $100 I buy the app for $1; okay, that's cool. Would I put $1,000 in the wallet? No way I'm going to buy a version of open source code for $10.

Imagine working hard for twenty years straight day in and day out to bring home a paycheck for your family. You've saved up some money that you have so desperately wanted but alas it doesn't quite have the purchasing power you thought it would because inflation hits hard quickly.
Then you learn about an alternative currency that made some random drug dealers on Silk Road richer than you in a few days despite your twenty years of hard work. You have to swallow that pill of reality that you've been tricked for your whole life into working for something that is ultimately worthless.

This is a dangerous thing to say because it causes the assumption that anyone who wants privacy wants privacy because they're attempting to launder money or commit a crime. When everyone is comfortable leaving their actions traceable by big players like Coinbase or Circle it brings suspicion to the transactions on the network that are not from within Circle and Coinbase.
Imagine a world where everyone was comfortable sending letters to each other without putting them in envelopes. If I tried to send a letter to my friend in an envelope it would raise suspicion. The people at the post office would think "Why did this person want to put an envelope on his letter? Does his message reveal something incriminating about himself?"

(Here comes the downvotes for being blunt and not saying popular opinion.)
You see, the small blocks side of the debate does not care what the majority agrees on or desires. Bitcoin is not a democracy, but rather a plutocracy. The more bitcoins one has, the less concerned one is about not being able to get a transaction into a block. People who do not have bitcoins will be forced to use fiat systems because they won't be able to afford the transaction fee. This is their fault for not acquiring bitcoins while they still had a chance, and they will pay the price for being late to the game.
Much to the surprise of the common redditard, the high transaction fees will not cause bitcoin to fail, but rather cause a desire for more bitcoins. For without enough bitcoins, one cannot afford to use the blockchain. And if you can't use the blockchain, you are forced to use fiat. Bitcoiners will cleverly push for all the legislation that empowers them and the idiotic masses enjoy: minimum wage increase! random refunds! welfare programs! All of these sheep-in-wolf-clothing positions will further debase the currency used by the public.
Of course the poor people want an increased block sized - they're doomed without it. But this is a concern for them - not for bitcoiners.

I think I may have just answered my own question: tell me if my reasoning is correct. The private key is so that when I announce my payment, an attacker node with more broadcasting power cannot take my public key, change the recipient's public key hash to his own, and then broadcast it to more nodes and get THAT transaction included in the block chain, effectively stealing my bitcoins.

Not necessarily. He is merely offering the journalist a trade. Markets are a game of incomplete information. If the journalist has some knowledge that the BTC defender doesn't have that allows him to have 100% confidence that he will win the bet, it is in the journalist's interest to take the bet. 
It's also funny how everyone upvoted me without realizing the flaw in my argument. Who said the price ever has to hit $100 or $1000? ~~The BTC holder loses using this strategy if the price falls, but only to $101 and remains there.~~

Storing bitcoins is insanely easy. All I need to do is guard a secret private key. I can use a 2-of-3 key scheme so that if any one key is loss or stolen I'm fine.
The blockchain takes up almost no hard drive space. 30 GB may sound like  a lot but it's really not in the grand scheme of things. Also end users only need to use an SPV client which only requires downloading block headers which is a trivial amount of storage space for even a mobile phone.

60 grand to hold an entire copy of the blockchain, something completely unnecessary for most users and completely reasonable for any large company. That's way cheaper than the cost of employing one accountant. Also, you have completely taken Moore's law out of the equation which has held true for so many years. It will be very cheap to store petabytes of data in the near future.

If there are any posts that satoshi or Gaven or any other core dev have as to why the block reward halving schedule was chosen I would love to read them because I only have theories on why it was chosen the way it was.
I think satoshi choose the current mechanism to vastly favor early adopters to promote growth in the ecosystem. Imagine satoshi released an additional separate piece of software where the distribution of coins were linear over time. If you were to start building out the infrastructure for one of those two coins you'd want to pick the coin with the logarithmic distribution because it vastly favors early adopters. 
Obviously one could argue then: why not create an even more front-weighted coin? Well then maybe people wouldn't think that's fair and apart from the first group to join no one else will want to join...

Yes but that's a good thing. For example, I can make a bet that there will not be a flood in my town and then actively work to make sure that that bet is realized. If I have a good method to prevent floods then the odds will be cheap. People can buy into a bet that wins if a flood happens and use that as their insurance. 
Of course, people could buy "flood insurance" and then try to cause the flood. That being said, the method to prevent floods should probably take into account that someone may wanna try to actively cause a flood (so building a damn vulnerable to an attack from like a bomb or something would not be good enough.)

Please explain how this is a false dichotomy. Bitcoin's success is best measured by its value in U.S. dollars. Bitcoin becomes more useful as its dollar value increases, because more trade can be done on the Bitcoin network itself. If the value of Bitcoin increases dramatically with respect to the dollar, the value of the dollar must therefore decrease dramatically too.

Here you go:
Assume the challenger has 100 BTC and 0 dollars. He sells his 100 BTC at $230 so now he has 0 BTC and $23,000. If he loses the bet, he must buy back 100 BTC at $100 a piece, so he is left with $13,000 for a gain of $3,000 (because if he hadn't made the bet he would have 100 BTC at $100 a piece.)
Now assume the challenger wins the bet. He will have 100 BTC + $23,000 which is also better than if he hadn't made the bet.

american, DO NOT upgrade your code. It's a trap. The reason your bitcoins are valuable is because the fact that you have them means you can handle the transaction fees. You're the man now who can use the new FedWire, while everyone else is forced to use the ChangeTip's of the world. Make no mistake - bitcoin's about keeping the losers off the financial network. Yes, transaction fees are going to start soaring to $10,000+, but this is a problem for people without bitcoins, not us.

The actual point of Coinbase is to suppress the price of Bitcoin. If you try to buy through localbitcoins or any other similar avenue you will realize that most people are not so willing to part ways with their precious bitcoins for worthless printed fiat currency. Thus, the state must keep a reserve of bitcoins that they can sell to prevent a speculative attack. If Coinbase were to disappear then all the people who buy on Coinbase would have to hit the streets, clearing the localbitcoins order books and sending the price to a point high enough that people lose faith in the dollar.

Yup, most miners are in it for dollars but that's okay because it's the holders not the miners who control bitcoin. Bitcoin investors will constantly try to make the schematics of the best mining chips open source so everyone can help fight against centralization.
I know it can be very frustrating to see everyone in the bitcoin space confused and doing dumb things like using centralized wallets and not forcing companies like Coinbase to have full reserves by withdrawing their coins, but such is life. It doesn't matter in the end because bitcoin's fate is determined by those who hold the private keys. Daniel Krawisz says it best
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:13:17
We're on the same team here buddy, relax. You're not expressing an opinion your expressing a fact that bitcoin has a weakness due to the centralization of mining. But you're not offering a solution - just restating a problem that has been known about since day one.
The reason I replied to your comment was because it's important to understand that high centralized hash rate is better than a low decentralized hash rate. This is because in both scenarios we are susceptible to a 51% attack, except with a high hash rate it's more expensive to perform one. Obviously it's more complicated than this because decentralization and hash rate are on a sliding and not binary scale.

This is not a technical issue it's a political issue. 20 MB means that we go to 1TB+ of memory in a year (20 * 6 * 365 * 24) to run a full node.

This was about those traders who, before going to sleep, wrote a command saying "If price drops at or below $180, buy 3 BTC."

Bitfinex has lowered the price to do fake short squeezes in the past. They dropped the price by $50 for ~15 minutes, and fraudulently margin called clients who had a long position.

Why do you believe that all transactions need to occur on chain? The blockchain is the ultimate source of truth, using it is overkill for things like buying a coffee. That would be like using Fedwire when you go to starbucks.
Also, your argument is that "man Gavin's a great guy and I trust him." Satoshi released his software as anonymous to show that his code should not be trusted because "oh I like this guy" but because his code is good.

Most "client" wallets are SPV (simplified payment verification) wallets.

@_date: 2015-02-08 00:32:30
Yes. SPV wallets is one of the cleverest aspects of bitcoin and if that section had not been in the whitepaper I'm not sure I would have taken interest to bitcoin. Let's say that each block was 1TB of memory instead of 1MB like it is today. A client application using SPV only needs to look at logn of the block to be assured it has received payments. So log2(n) when n = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes is ~40bytes! 
To calculate how much memory the SPV client needs you need to do the following:
80 Bytes * Block Height + Log2(Block Size In Bytes) * Num_Addresses_Owned
Note: The compromise is that the SPV client can only know that it is in control of coins represented in the *longest* chain but not the *longest correct* blockchain. To use an SPV wallet you make the assumption that the longest chain is also the longest correct blockchain. This is a pretty easy assumption to make but if you're running a large company it may be worth it to download a full chain on a dedicated computer.

As a 21 yo, I think I will live to see self maintained miners. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they already exist. If I invented self maintained miners I would want to keep that a secret.

Personally, I'm loving the price.

Yeah I'm pretty sure this happens about once every 1-2 days. The chance drops exponentially though as time goes on, so you're pretty good after 2 confirmations.

Nice, calling my plan retarded without giving a single reason as to why. Also admitting you are too much of a coward to sell your 1MB chain coins so you're just going to play it safe and see which chain wins out. To be fair, that is the second smartest play you can make come fork time.
But I have news for you. If &gt;1MB squad "plays it safe" and &lt;1MB sells their &gt;1MB coins, then &gt;1MB chain loses. Let's assume there's Cs (chain-small) and Cb (chain-big.) Cs advertises to miners to mine Cs over Cb. Cs holders tell miners that for every block they win on Cs, they will get the block reward on Cs and they will ALSO get 25 BTC on Cb sent to the public key that was used to collect the coinbase on Cs. So now miners have to choose between mining on Cb, where they only get 25 BTC / block or mining on Cs, where they get 25 BTC on BOTH chains.

I pay the TSA tax, but not without complaints. I do it because I'm scared for my life, I don't want to be thrown in a cell.

This is very expensive. You have to 1) figure out who has bitcoins 2) employ someone to physically detain the person. Sure you could do it to a few people but not everyone.
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:55:34
Awesome so I'll give you all my &gt;1MB coins and you give me all your &lt;1MB chain coins?
It's not just Mircea &amp; crew. Anyone who has a mild idea of how Bitcoin works is going to use this tactic. No one is going to have the guts to dump their 1MB coins. Why would you risk coins on a chain that has worked for 6+ years for coins on a chain that has been out for a few hours?
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:13:48
It's not that simple. It's not like you can magically transform worthless paper into mining rigs. As they start to buy mining machines, the price of mining machines will go up. Also trust me this community is watching for shit like that and there will be many who mine honest blocks at a loss just to stop this kinda thing (I know I would.)
Also, a 51% attack is not that bad. It's happened before and it just temporarily puts the network on pause.
Lastly, these governments and central banks are very unintelligent. Most people think they are very smart for fooling everyone into using their currency, but their scam is really simple and only made possible by brute force, weapons, and manipulation.
When someone inside these organizations actually realizes the potential of bitcoin they are put in a game where they can either inform their superiors of how they need to fuck the network up with 51% attacks quickly, or they can defect and quietly buy bitcoins.

Alright thank you. If you could please add it to the rules I didn't see anything there about tipping.

You don't know they're stolen. That's like saying I can't buy anything on ebay because the seller might have stole the good he is providing and it is my duty to do an investigation on the seller.
@_date: 2015-02-09 07:29:51
Right, I would personally never buy on those sites. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:45:49
Yeah as I said in my other post SPV scales even if block sizes are as large as petabytes each. As soon as it's necessary I think it's absolutely fine to make the blocksize that big. There are people who disagree with me though because then there would be fewer full nodes.
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:58:26
He has it in his white paper. I don't think it was necessary for the very first version though because there were very few blocks! So it probably only got implemented after he was done.

You should learn to code no matter what. Not knowing how to code will soon be akin to not knowing how to read or write.

"Master, please stop stealing so much from me. I can barely get by." I don't give a fuck about anyone who wears a costume and pretends to have authority over other human beings. Their rule is not and cannot ever be justified.

You got the jist of it. If exchanges for 1MB get closed down for whatever reason, then the only way to protect the 1MB chain is to subsidize the miners mining on the smaller chain by paying them coins on the big chain for mining on the small chain.

Hoarding is what gives things value. If the rich were to start spending all their money recklessly its value would drop to zero.

Alright so you jump to the assumption that everyone will be on board with the new changes, which is a false assumption. Let me explain why:
1) Why would Coinbase, the largest BTC company right now, want this change? Coinbase provides an amazing service of allowing people to send BTC for free to another Coinbase user. If the mega blocks were to occur, people could do transactions without Coinbase which takes away one of Coinbase's largest value propositions. Coinbase stands to lose a lot if they accept this upgrade.
2) Why would miner's want this upgrade? If I'm mining at home and this upgrade were to occur I'd have to sell some of my BTC for fiat to buy hard drive space. Why would a miner want to do that? Contrary to popular belief, hard drive space is not that cheap. Sure it's cheap if you have it hosted in a data-center, but bitcoin-core is the kinda thing that needs to be kept locally and specifically not in a data center that you do not have control over.
3) Bitcoin is so fragile. So, so fragile. Any small mistake in the code and it might be game over. We're humans and far from perfect - it's super feasible that we will accidentally break consensus in bitcoin. Bitcoin, as it stands, *works.* We have six years of confidence built in, if we hard-fork we need to rebuild all that trust into the new version of code.
The only people who I can see want this change are poor people (in BTC terms) so that they can continue to use the blockchain without having to have large BTC holdings. While this is the majority of the world, these people have absolutely no voting power in Bitcoin land.
@_date: 2015-02-08 03:15:01
Right I just don't see how advising someone to use bitcoin when they are experiencing their bank screwing them over is off-topic.

The full block does not need to be downloaded for verification. The SPV wallet has the merkle root of the most recent block. To assure itself that it has been paid all it needs to do is query a full node for the merkle path that proves the payment transaction is in the most recent block. In other words it needs to download log(n) of the most recent block, where n is the number of transactions.
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:59:44
Be careful, it seems you're trading on emotion. Remember, it's more logical to buy when the price dips.
All this being said I recommend just dollar cost averaging and not worrying about the short term price.

Exactly how does this show demand? This means you want to give away your coins. Instead, ask your employer to pay you in BTC.

Buying on those sites is beneficial to the bitcoin community, especially if you reinvest what you spend. There's definitely nothing morally wrong with buying on those sites, although you may get police knocking on your door because the card used to buy your good was stolen.
