The bitcoin chart over time should in theory be flat or Or upward sloping in the long term due to limited supply. 
Under the current $ system you you work and your work is worth a value, let’s say $1. But it’s only worth that $1 right away and less each year with inflation. So saving the money in $ loses value. Even if wages keep up with inflation you lose buying power in last years $ saved.

Wrong. You can.

That's correct. Like kind losses/gains are first netted against each other than what losses are left over in either category can be taken against the category. 
The $3k is the amount of excess losses that don't offset gain, that can be used as a federal income tax deduction. And also not excess losses can be carried over to either offset subsequent year gain or taken as a federal income tax deduction, again up to a $3k annual limit

I mean, yeah but if the payments are over a period of time and bitcoin increases in price in the future it would cost the team more money than they wanted to pay him. If bitcoin goes down it would cost the team less in way of dollars. I don’t think the team wants to speculate in bitcoin. Player is free to buy bitcoin with his own money or take a personal loan against future earning and invest now.

Because they would then need to buy the bitcoin today to not risk price changes in bitcoin. And a team is a company they would rather use the money for future payment to invest in something else. 
What you are saying won’t work. Let’s say the player is due $8,000,000 next year. In today’s prices that would be about 1,000 bitcoins. Explain to me how the team could agree to these terms and not speculate in bitcoin. The only way would be to buy the bitcoins now. With the money, but then they couldn’t use that money now to invest in something else.

I’m not sure how that would work since tariffs are based on the value of the goods imported through customs
