“I think BitCoin is going to play out in 3-5 years, not longer. The reason for that is one of the most powerful forces, the one that people underestimate, the force of a network effect. The value of a network increases exponentially with the addition of each node.”  -Andreas Antonopoulos

Did anyone truly believe that, when regulation is enacted, it would do anything other than prop the status quo?  The amount of money and power backing the current system at stake is mind numbing.  Which ever law maker that kills BitCoin, or does the most damage to it near term, is going to enjoy a very comfortable retirement as a "consultant" to the big banks.  I do believe in Crypto currency and that it is here to stay, but if anyone thought the gates would be open and path to glory lined with rose petals is in for a very rude awakening.  I am optimistic too, the first national economy that embraces BitCoin will have such a huge leg up on the rest.  Mr Lawsky could end up being the most hated or most loved historical figure of our time. dun dun dun!!! Tune in! Can't wait.

Same argument can be made for diamond and ruby mining.  Sure there are some industrial uses, but gold and gem mining is always a speculative gamble I pursuit of something scarce that has tangible real world value.  Bitcoin and bitcoin mining is no different.

PayPal would kill it if they just went and issued their own coin.  It wouldn't be able to compete long term with BTC but could hold it off a little longer.

I am a bit smitten on BitCoin, an unapologetically so.  I look at it as a company stock.  It probably comes from the equities and options day-trader part of me; however, my passion for it is rooted in the fundamentals, the simplicity, and the revolutionary nature of something that is the "first." I haven't felt this way about anything since I had my first email address in 1995 and would talk someone's ear off concerning what the Internet can and will do for the world.  The obsession is real and I admit it, so if that comes off as delusional so be it.  Good luck to you in your research and when and if you decide to buy a bitcoin I hope the price is still this low :-)

Looking like you will be the winner if Mt Gox officially is done.  I called it when their website went offline at 1030pm EST on 2/24 and you were the closest.  Price on Coinbase was 500 at that time so you almost nailed that as well!  Good job!

the signs were there, I've only been serious about BitCoin since last June and it was common knowledge it was sketch.  Withdrawals taking too long, and over inflated prices and fees.  They suffered a class 'run on the bank.'  Feel bad for the innocents for sure.

It was a leap of faith and quite a few tests transfers and backups before I started keeping coins in cold storage.  There is a real fear of them being lost forever so I can understand the intimidation factor of it all.  it's time consuming too and most of us are fairly lazy. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 14:29:17
Also the close proximity to Russia factors in as well.  There is still that neutrality, almost Swiss like, that you want to preserve.  With Russia being one of the least friendly toward bitcoin so far, would be awesome to see one of its neighbors be a major torch holder for crypto.

Hate to be cold, but anyone leaving their coins on an exchange is taking a lot of risk; and on Mt Gox, well that is a whole other level of stupidity.  I am sorry for your losses and others as well.  Rumor is 700k bitcoins "lost." The warning signs have been there for the past four months with Mt Gox.  There will be no big brother too big to fail bailouts here, the free market has spoken. This will make us and the network that much stronger, and wiser. Let's keep our heads held high during the sure to be ensuing media trashing and load up on these cheap coins.

Freaked me out the first transaction confirmation on BTC-e comes up in 100% Cyrillic, Russian maybe?  No clue, I had to copy and paste to translate.  Made me think the site was in the country of Russia.  So the night Russia banned crypto I rushed into BTCe and sold all of LiteCoin and Peercoin.  Then I decided to ask the trollbox where it was located, ya think, and they replied Bulgaria.  Oh well.
