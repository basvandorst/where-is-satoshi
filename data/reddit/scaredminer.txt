What they haven't told you is that the chips will be doing what is today referred to as selfish mining.  Can't wait for that shitstorm once it comes out..

It makes sense though, who's going to invest millions of dollars in a network they have no control over?
  
Would you rather it is more centralized behind public company pools or pools operated by anonymous actors?  Centralization is not going to go away as long as humans are making the decisions.

Bro, he tried to murder people, this appears to be hard for you to accept.  You must live in a very delicate reality if you have to defend a criminal like Ross in order to justify your own beliefs. 
  
You don't need Ulbricht to justify your belief that the drug war is wrong, it is wrong, but murder is inexcusable.  Even when it is attempted murder.  Didn't your momma teach you that it's the thought that counts?

I think this is what they are talking about: 
  
That is not a smear job, it objectively covers evidence presented at the trial.  It looks like you're an Ulbricht apologist based on your history.

I think the idea is that you are hashing for 21's pool.  They appear to be working on step one which is secure the network, step two is build on the network you have secured.

Most people don't own any bitcoin...

You will mine bitcoin and you will like it.

Do you have a source for this?

That is not what most people would consider a "physical bitcoin" since it doesn't have a private key attached to it.  That's just a worthless piece of metal.

Damnit, I just hit 21 bitcoins and now I have to get to 50?  How long do I have to do that?

21inc could just settle on the blockchain without using it for the majority of its transactions.  They would be hardening the network they settle on with their micro miners and gaining more flexibility by doing transactions inside their ecosystem off-chain.

Unfortunately moore's law pretty much ensures that won't happen.  As mining gets more competitive, those that can develop and produce the most powerful miners wins.  Intel has traditionally had to build chips and then sell them to make a profit.  Now they can build chips that perform a task that makes them a profit.  This is a very attractive market that they cannot ignore because they already do it, and they don't need to incorporate it into their consumer wing.

Looks like the internet *needs some regulation*.

Use Coinbase.  You trust PayPal, so trust Coinbase, many around here see them as equivalent.  If your bank refuses them then contact Coinbase, they will go to bat for you(and themselves) and talk to your bank on your behalf.
