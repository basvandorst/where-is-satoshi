Does that amount of bitcoins even exist!?

Yea I know... was just trying to be funny. :/ Forgot what sub I was in for a moment.

I do not have experience in the field. I love the philosophical ideas of a socioeconomic utopia, but thus far have had mixed feelings regarding whether we are moving towards that. I do think decentralization of many aspects of government would be a part of a more positive future. The adage "think globally, act locally" rings true. But beyond politics and economics, I believe a change in consciousness is the necessary ingredient... The internet and the exponential free flow of information is definitely facilitating this. The world in a mere decade will look very strange IMO. In 30-50 years? I don't think the average person can even imagine that.

I think that's true, it's the contrast and polarity which encourages growth. However, I don't think that rules out strict to create a better world, working towards a utopia, which will have a lifetime of challenges along the way.

Interesting ideas. Can you recommend any books on connected community decentralization?

Agreed. There has to be over 1000x the amount of individuals holding at this point. Multiple more international exchanges, liquidity, etc.

Sheets are found on the Darknets too.

It wasn't. The alternative was elected leaders who were trying to do good for their people. This contradicted American corporate interest. Look up the history of the coups. Mossadegh in Iran was another telling example.

Wonder if we would have this problem if millions of people were mining Bitcoin on their desktops as intended.

Seems to me there has been a massive psyops campaign to deceive and confuse American voters. Most people over 40 are so utterly brainwashed by cable news.

I've been reading up on this all week and I'm still confused what variables would cause a fork to occur.

Overthrowing Democratically elected leaders and replacing them with strongmen is a good job?

China is waking up soon.

Could you just cash out 38k per year over the course of your lifetime to avoid the taxes?
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:12:58
Cool, doable for me.

Could be 20 billion dollars taken from the feds capital surplus have been pumped into the stock market?

What happens if a hardware wallet fails?

If you have a lot of money it seems like an easy way to buy a crap ton of coins at once.
@_date: 2016-10-29 15:36:05
You think *those* people are still holding coins? I think they took their losses and sold long ago.
@_date: 2016-10-07 06:10:34
Well said. Paper money has its days numbered. The question is, are you prepared for the technological inversion? I foresee a future with many types of coins.

Monero is untraceable

Was about to say, 5000 BTC is worth over 12 million USD now. XD
