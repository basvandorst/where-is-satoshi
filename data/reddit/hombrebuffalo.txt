The bitcoin genesis block was very political. To me, peer to peer cash is a bold political statement against centralization with potential to change the world. I agree that we are all unique creatures. To me, advocating for equality is about opposing privilege, not using state violence to enforce it. I don't think I'm romanticizing socialism, left wing socialism is a historical fact that the power elites have silenced with much success since WW1. Stateless socialism is the original socialism. Marx advocated for the use of the state power as an intermediate phase. IMO he was wrong. It just led to facsists using the term to manipulate people. Here's a good short documentary on the subject

Socialism is a big word used to describe many different ideologies. Everything that's truly for decentralization of power usually fits the left wing branches of socialism, like left libertarianism, left marxism, libertarian socialism and all branches of anarchism but ancaps, which BTW used to be the most popular politics of the workers movement before WW1. Centralizing socialism like Soviet Union leninism and stalinism, Cuba, China, etc, are usually called State Capitalism and considered right wing by many prominent thinkers like Noam Chomsky ( You can't be for decentralization if you don't also opose centralization inside of capitalist hierarchical coorporations (hello ancaps). Freedom without equality remains incomplete. I think Andreas Antonoupulous would agree with some of this thinking.

A malicious user could try to double spend those same inputs, or the transaction be the double spend and then it would never confirm. The confirmations are the whole point of the blockchain and PoW. If it's not confirmed it's not in the blockchain.
