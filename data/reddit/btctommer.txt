Wow TradingView has plenty of deep analysis! I'll be reading it more tonight.

thanks for your input :) 
So is there a good alternative place for crypto price &amp; ranks relative to btc on github? 
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:59:06


I see! I also need to have my arguments ready because so many people i know just go straight to alts and overlook bitcoin's amazing potential for long term growth.

AH nice, I'm like cryptowatch. Looks easy to understand for non-technical people too. Thanks

thanks, I've been able to see the "year high" for all cryptocurrencies on coinkapp.com which was very helpful. However it was only for one year, so the ATH figure can be higher (the year before fore example). I've bookmarked it!

Thank you so much :) That's an impressive list of sites! I'm surprised there are so many amazing places to compare the rank &amp; positions of cryptocurrencies! I'm curious, which place do your prefer do use, and why exactly? 


Cool, Where on coinkapp do you see this?

hi thank you! I'm looking through coinalyze and there's lots live stats for bitcoin to fiat trading on the big exchanges. Is there any simplified pages for beginner crypto price information ?

ah cool, coinlib looks very beginner friendly has has a super clean interface to read from. This will be good for comparing the rank of coins relative to bitcoin's. 


So does this bitcoin and crypto price website get the same information as from coinmarketcap?
