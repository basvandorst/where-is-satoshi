Love this one. Like seeing the internet develop and expand in real time.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:35:01
this was a good one

can someone explain further the node debate in terms of scaling? i know one of the criticisms of bcash is that it will lead to a centralization of nodes since regular people wont be able to keep up. can someone explain that a little further? also how is this currently effecting ethereum?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:20:27
i see. so in essence, running a lightweight node on ethereum will eventually be impossible (assuming eth keeps growing)

this is cool buy why va beach? seems so random..

up 6k from thanksgiving. zoom out
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:37:05
lightning as advertised wouldnt be the same with out segwit. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:06:29
and how does PoS theoretically solve that, if the block size remains the same? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:29:32
right now bitcoin is usenet. lightning gives us email 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:36:15
they both basically follow eachother.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:39:22
honestly not sure. i have been seeing some bad things about electrum recently, but didnt look that much into it as i dont use it. i keep some btc in my breadwallet and keep the rest in nano. seems to be best/most common formula for longterm holding. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:00:34
thats a cool list thanks. wish bread wasnt so slow
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:21:19
this is a masterpiece 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:31:43
so i think i understand multi sig..can someone explain basics of schnorr tho
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:50:10
be thankful bitcoin has no central 'leader' like other currencies. the best thing for this community is that satoshi disappeared 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:15:10
dont understand how segwit adoption is so low. we keep shilling about the LN and how it will save everything, but you cant have one without the other. the fucks going on with this seriously 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:06:51
rat base
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:01:58
depends on how much u trust them then
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:26:49
send with as low as possible and wait. if it doesnt work your btc will return in 14 days and you can try again. or just pay the fee. i wouldnt keep your coins on any exchange though
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:54:02
salute this brave man/woman. like a mariner exploring the high seas or a pioneer on the oregon trail, gutsy moves like this is what it takes to for bitcoin to truly become mainstream. godspeed 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:08:44
fuckin beautiful to hear
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:29:11
Mr. Wu...................thank you
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:26:27
what a hypocrite. has a meltdown over "bcash" but calls bitcoin "bitcoin core"
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:25:16
saw this on another comment, but if you memorize your private keys you would be committing thought crime against the governemnt
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:46:46
i would still have respect for roger if he truly believed his was the better coin, and he stuck to his guns the way he did about bitcoin years ago. If went all out and just let the market decide. i wouldn't agree with him necessarily, but I would respect him. But this is just pathetic
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:18:38
its a process. a long one too. having skin in the game accelerates the learning curve, even if its just a small amount. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:50
this good in the long run. this shows us the danger of putting too much trust into a single entity. exchanges like these who try to seize control of the market will be annihilated, and only those that serve the people and abide by free market principles will succeed. if you are angry with coinbase, delete your account and move to another exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:11:59
normies love hearing about price gains, and its a good starting point for us. but this is why it all matters. just takes a little longer to grasp/appreciate. praise 2 satoshi
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:14:47
thanks. really love the idea on paper and will be interested to see how it plays out in reality. excited about btc's direction
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:06:14
i was reading that LN more or less uses the idea fo '6 degrees of seperation'..how does the network identify people's connections throughout the network and determine the fastest payment routes? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:29:44
no more bitcoin jesuses. not even andreas. lets not promote any nicknames like that. just sets bitcoin up for danger down the road
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:22
holy shit...beautiful
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:46:21
did kramer actually do that hard of a 180??? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:44
holy fuck. lads we are in for a correction of absolutely biblical proportions. steel yourselves
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:16:13
wow thats genius. next-level security. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:51:21
can someone explain the lightning network more in-depth? Who is developing it, how many transactions will be grouped together when it is implemented, is there a certain limit that lightning will limit (ie,  max is 2btc transfer), and what is a ballpark date where it will be usable? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:16
literally no other option than to hodl until gemini verifies me. coinbase gets squashed like a fucking bug everytime theres a flurry of activity its impossible to sell
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:16:16
just brilliant
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:33:43
wow..this is pretty amazing. please update if and when they actually do pay you in btc
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:17:04
what a fucking scam artist hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:25:35
i wholeheartedly agree. i think the main point about the price is that it is it interests normies. once they have $50-$100, they become interested and want to know what they actually have. but for people who are knowledgeable about bitcoin and truly believe in it, the price (while exciting as fuck) should definitely be a secondary thing

gdax refuses to verify my identity
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:15:19
by far the funniest comment ive ever seen on reddit lmaooooo
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:25:48
sorry i have to disagree with andreas on this one. the drama is very real. does it matter in the long run? maybe not, but no one can read the future. there is a group of people actively trying to trick ppl into thinking their coin 'is the real bitcoin'. are we supposed to just sit back and let them say it ? also, most of the FUD is still coming outside the crypto community, and i think the community as a whole still does a good job of banding together to refute  hot takes from Wall st and the MSM. yes there are lots of debates happening within crypto and within bitcoin, but that's been the case with every new innovation or technology in the world. people who debate on reddit are not spies or paid shills, that's just a dumb and toxic thing to say 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:01:53
100%. but nicknaming anyone after a god is just unnecessary and dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:36:11
free ross ulbricht, give him some btc and a computer and lets end this mess lmao 
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:53:07
as andreas says, its going to happen either way, so its kind of irrelevant. manipulation happens without etfs. if bitcoin cant survive etfs than its not what we thought it was. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:51:31
so how many utxos does satoshis stack represent
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:45:36
can someone help me better understand utxo's? i read yesterday that bitcoin has 4 million utxos..how do we know this and what does that exactly mean
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:41:34
went down like $600 calm tf down
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:09:48
"Bitcoin should be able to survive and remain censorship resistant in the worst case scenario" 
golden rule
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:17:50
no i mean how many utxos does satoshis 1 million btc represent. are his unused coins 1 big utxo or a bunch
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:46:45
already priced in brah
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:59:14
biggest exchange in the world, put about a $200 tariff on every coin, and still havent implemented or invested in scaling solutions to handle new customers. what happens when the market *actually* becomes flooded with normies trying to trade. what is crypto adoption worldwide right now, or even just in the US? they have no excuses
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:54:32
have the exact same thing. never happened before. coinbase needs to get their shit together
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:25:22
how long did it take for the purchases to show up on your account summary? bought like an hour ago and its still not showing up
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:25:53
tbh couldnt help but feel a little sorry for roger. its clear he has some sort of mental/emotional issue. sad to see what he has become.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:55:51
welcome lad and spread the good news
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:43:50
its incredible to think how far ahead btc of all other coins in the market (besides litecoin perhaps). as new coins enter the space trying to attract users to layer 1, bitcoin is already unveiling layer 2 for a network that transmits billions of dollars per day. i've never been more bullish
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:58:53
big players are about to solidify their territory on btc island. time to see if ya'll are real holders or not
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:42:42
this is some alan partridge shit lol. good explanation though
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:38:10
seems like NVT ratio is a bit high. think price will drop in a bit
