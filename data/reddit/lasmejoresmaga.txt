what ya got in the 13000 range?

bcash is just an alt, always has been always will be. probably shouldn't post bcash/alt coin stuff here unless it has to do with Bitcoin

interesting, didn't think about it like that. I just assumed it was a stable build because it could withstand mining with cpu and GPU overnight, but I guess it is just a specific task that you're stress testing

if you think it's going to 10 k then buy now while it's below 10 k

if you transmit another in that transaction, to the same wallet, from the same wallet, with a higher fee, the network will disregard the first one and use the second one

had a withdrawal take about 2 hours yesterday going to my Leger

yes, however, if you first move you wallet to gdax.com, which is associated to coinbase, you can then move from gdax to your personal wallet fee free usually, is just a little slow right now, totally 24hrs

sorry to hear you got emotional over it and ended up losing a ton of money. maybe the life lesson you learned was worth what you spent. 
thank you for posting this so others can see the real consequences of playing fast and loose with Bitcoin

if you think it is undervalued, early, if you think it's overvalued, late, if you don't know, wait and see

Fido u2f included, it's actually a real nice feature to have bundled with it
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:50:10
it is actually a pretty good stress test, leave it running overnight and wake up to a free dollar worth of bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:50:37
i don't think that's how evidence works
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:51:14
yeah I know the volume of trades was insane on gdax in such a small period. wasn't able to buy the dip 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:47:36
yup I got one too. it is a recommended practice to control your own keys, and a hardware wallet does just that. you are technically still trusting the hardware manufacturer can't get at your private keys, but I think that's an unfounded paranoia, as you could manage to be paranoid just about anything if that scares you.
I'm actually using the fido u2f stuff too on Google and things. it works great as a hardware universal second factor authentication
one thing I will say is try to limit transactions to and from it, or at least pay attention to the fees it will charge before sending any transactions.
be sure to choose segwit Bitcoin for fastest and lowest fee potential. if for some reason you're still holding bcash you actually don't even need a second crypto installed to support it, you can toggle the button in your Bitcoin wallet from original, segwit, bcash and bcash fork, but for your sake I hope you have no bcash
you can store up to 4 different cryptos on it as well.

it depends why it crashed, if it crashed just because a panic run that happens all the time in Bitcoin, and I still think it will be worth 10 k in the near future then hell yes I'd buy a much as I can. I'd be a fool to not seize on what I would consider a sale. however if the reason it crashed was because of some foundational issue like security being compromised then yes I would want to move my money to something more stable like fiat or gold
