Thanks for that. Are there any algortithms currently in existence that can contend with quantum computers?

I'm not trying to sound arrogant. But so did I. So did I whole bunch of people. Lots of people have decent imaginations. SciFi becomes SciFact all the time.

Yeah like they said. Fortune. Forbes is much more reputable in my opion.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:13:18
Hmmm I will look into that. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:56:21
I see what you are saying. Thanks for the back and forth. All the best!

How so? A bubble implies something that has a much higher market price than its actual value and that it will take a very steep drop in market price, taking a long time to recover. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to determine traditional value of bitcoin as this is an investment and a currency. Nothing like it has ever existed. Also bitcoin prices recover in days or weeks. So how can someone claim with any confidence that bitcoin is a bubble?

You're like those religious fanatics that keep trying to predict the end of the world. Fyi, they are always wrong. So what if it does dip? Op to buy cheap BTC.

I thought so too. I think it was an error in gdax transfer process.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:06:21
Sorry, that was funny

Yeah that's what i thought. Their support has not been impressive as of yet. It's like they didn't read to support ticket.

Then its not a bubble. If market price crashes and then shortly it goes back well past the peak price before the crash over and over again, how they heck is it a bubble?

@_date: 2017-09-13 05:35:51
Exactly!!! 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:23:20
how could it possibly go down to $500?? maaaayybee 3k at the very worst. too much buzz now. it's all over the media. even bad press is awareness. just need people buying.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:28:09
awarness breads buyers. more buyers, higher value. and  if anything price is way under valued from a market stand point.  the fact that it WILL be the currency of the future. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:05:17
um, it maxed at 4900. right now it's down, best time to buy if you can afford to. it'll go back up.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:24:41
youre trolling , fud off
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:33:36
lol, dude, wtf, just buyyyy . you think a "crash" is a 10% loss is a day that's already rebounding. straight dumb. sucks I have to deal with the fact that so many people thin like you. jesus
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:53:28
yes, flipping worm holes everywhere bro
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:48:59
yes do it. I've been making 5% roi a day. except today lol. but tomor prob 10%   but dude, learn, study, it's a steep curve and technically complicated to be able to buy cheap and knowing what to buy. and when to sell. I recommend CoinAlarm app. you can set what you buy at, any coin. then set the percent you want to sell or buy at. I recommend 5% if you can buy cheap in gdax. Coinbase best wallet. best time to buy a bunch. Coinbase biggish fees those. after you get a a few hundred.or thousand, if your smart you can just trade on gadax, bittex, kraken etc bad jeep making more capital. best of luck.
sorry for typos
