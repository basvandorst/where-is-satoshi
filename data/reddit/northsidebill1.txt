The people who leave those cards are exactly why stabbing people should be legal in some cases

I think its called being overly paranoid. Agree to disagree?

Thats more money than I have ever seen before. At least money that had anything to do with me. I had no idea what a bitcoin was, never heard of them. Methinks some further reading is called for here

Happy Cakeday! I know the feeling of a community one can belong to, Reddit has done that for me too :)

Dispatcher: 9-1-1 What's the nature of your emergency?
Caller: My wife is pregnant and her contractions are only two minutes apart
Dispatcher: Is this her first child?
Caller: No, you idiot! This is her husband!

So why not say "Dont talk to cops if you have done anything wrong" instead of making it sound like every cop is out to screw anyone they can?

I am planning on stopping in the next time I am near Zionsville. Are you guys on Facebook? Have a website?

I can never find anyone locally, or the very few times I do they are selling thousands of dollars all at once
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:20:08
I think it worked! Thanks!

Question for all of the "Never talk to the cops" people in this thread: What happens when someone wrongs you and you need a cop? Do you just suck it up and live with whatever happened to you? If not, youre a hypocrite. 
Im just learning about bitcoins, I first heard of them about a week ago. This is fascinating, Im glad I joined the subreddits I found.

Its pretty funny and at the same time pretty sad that you think "fair" and the US legal system have anything to do with one another

Nice! I have been meaning to get to your shop, now I have even more of a reason. I think we have met, did you do the Irvington Farmers Markets this year?
