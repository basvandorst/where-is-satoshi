There's not an unlimited amount of BTC, there is a hard cap.
Hence why it's a deflationary currency.

Aren't cryptocurrencies too speculative to be eligible for capital gains?

That really depends on your age. If you're 65 and retired, or 55 and nearing retirement age, then 1% is a good figure. If you're in your 20s and have money to spare, you can afford to invest a hell of a lot more, as a lot of people that age live paycheck to paycheck anyway.

I'm not sure. I don't think there's a trick, it's just really high resolution.

You sure? Unless I'm mistaken, it's 85P12 which equals 6.30e+22 (`85!(85-12)!`).
If we account for all of the possible seed lengths 12 to 24, we get:
`12∑24(85!(85-n)!) = 1.28e+234`
That's just too high to bruteforce.

Hmm. I'd agree but you shouldn't invest more than you can afford to lose. At my age (late teens) I can afford to lose all my money, so all my money is in alts. Although, this does sound super naive now that I'm reading it back.
Next bull run I'm going to try and not be stupid and take some money out when I think it's getting ridiculously high, because being left with 15% of what you had before is honestly quite depressing.
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:20:05
At my age and risk profile, I'm 100% in alts. Gotta love seeing your portfolio down 85+% hahaha

If you're planning to buy any time soon, now's the time. Don't forget it's still at a very low price.
Plus, you help drive the price up for the rest of us who bought at the bottom.

Damn, it's gone back down. Time to buy more :)
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:18:21
There's no way of knowing. It could plummet, it could stay the same, it could increase marginally, it could be worth $0, it could be worth $1,000,000.
EDIT: Obviously some of these things are more likely than the others.

@_date: 2017-07-22 18:28:20
Um, it's not feasible to expect bitcoin to quadruple in value in 2 months.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:50:47
Nonononono! Buy when the value is LOW! (or dollar average)
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:38:14
The guy asked for advice; I gave my opinion. The price has dipped- we don't know if it will ever go this low again. I'm certainly going to be buying more.
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:44:49
Again, I ask you- do you still use AltaVista? 
I fully appreciate that alts are bets, but so is BTC. I don't disagree with what you've said, I disagree with the people who are making out that there are no real use cases for altcoins, and that they will all fail. They're all cryptos, and the ones with actual real use cases and factors distinguishing themselves from Bitcoin differ from Bitcoin (with regards to success) in one factor only: adoption.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:04:54
Not saying you're not right, but never cite the Daily Mail
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:00:41
Read the white paper? Of course. And the yellow paper. Understand the maths? On a conceptual level, yes. But I'm fairly certain that you don't fully understand the maths behind BTC, either. Anyone claiming to do so is probably lying, unless they're part of the team which maintains BTC.
Chat with the leading devs? Nope, but the fact that they are available to talk to speaks volumes. Find out who the investors are? That's an ambiguous question. Their goals are laid out in the white and yellow papers. The teams are incredibly talented. If we followed this logic to fruition there would be zero use cases for alts, and no one would invest in them. There would be no market capitulation for alts, only a few thousand investors perhaps that they managed to swindle.
But no. Alas, there are hundreds of altcoins with high and flourishing market caps (during bullish periods, anyway- not claiming that many alts have done well as of recent, but BTC absolutely hasn't either).
Claiming that there are zero viable alts is incredibly naive. There are hundreds of altcoins with more use case than BTC. Smart contracts are hardly even a thing with BTC, and the transaction speed and scalability of BTC are superseded by countless other alts. The lightning network is years away from being mainstream, if it even gets there at all. I can do all of the things that Bitcoin has planned for the future today with alts that I hold. That hardly seems like alts trying to play "me too", and more Bitcoin  attempting to play catch up.
Notice how through all of this I never once claimed that BTC had no use, unlike yourself with alts. BTC has use. Will it die? Possibly. In fact, it's fairly likely that any given cryptocurrency will die. Altcoins included. Think back to AltaVista, AskJeeves, or MySpace; all three at some point would have had claims made about them along the lines of them being too big to die. But they did (pretty much).
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:06:15
Nope. I'd be worse off. 
Don't know why I even bother with You'd figure a subreddit dedicated to a cryptocurrency would be celebratory of the success of other cryptocurrencies, but they're about as close-minded as they come.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:43:56
Bull flag?
@_date: 2018-12-30 10:47:57
Let's not forget that Bitcoin itself is down 85%. BTC made up a solid 30-40% of my portfolio during this loss of 98% (which, incidentally, is an exaggeration anyway).
Can you not possibly fathom a world where coins with real uses are used alongside Bitcoin? Bitcoin's only real use is as a store of value, which it does excellently. Transactions? NANO and XLM do it better. Privacy? XMR does it better. Contracts? ETH and NEO do it better. I could go on.
Notice that nowhere did I claim that Bitcoin will die out, nor did I claim that it has no use, unlike yourself with alts. All I claim is that alts have their use cases.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:48:52
Most *cryptos* will fail- this is true. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc, are all cryptos.
Past and present performance don't indicate future performance. Still use AltaVista? AskJeeves? MySpace? Didn't think so :)
EDIT: don't read this as me saying that Ethereum or Bitcoin will fail. I have no clue. I like Bitcoin. I like Ethereum. I am vested in alts, but not the two former cryptos. Take that as you will.
Had I held Bitcoin or Ethereum, I would also be down 98%. Alts essentially move alongside BTC and ETH except for those few sparkling bull runs where you find that a crypto which was worth $0.30 a few days ago is now worth multiple tens of dollars, followed by the inevitable crash back to reality. I've seen it with AntShares (now NEO), AION, STQ, VEN (now VET), etc. It's fun. Difficult to watch, but fun, if you can distance yourself from your wallet so every loss doesn't make you die inside.
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:22:44
*You call them shitcoins. 
You do realise that BTC is down 85% too?
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:58:32

Me, down 98% on all my alts.
It gets harder and harder to hold every year.
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:38:07
I know. Things come and go. Projects fail. BTC has the liberty of being first to the pot- that's why it's stayed around for so long. It's had adoption. I don't doubt that the top 10 coins by market cap will be totally different in another 5 years time. But gradually we are going to see more coins "sticking around". 
ETH, for starters. Personally, I believe NEO is here to stay. Who knows if BTC will still be there? I don't, and you don't. 
Yes, alts are bets, but so is BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:34:52
I strongly disagree. In fact, I don't think I could possibly disagree any more than I do.
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:46:09
It's not though. That would imply that there are no quality alts, which there most certainly are.
