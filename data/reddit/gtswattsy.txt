Yes....I know...
I see my last post didn't format correctly but I was pointing out that I'm British, obviously I can tell what you meant. You know it's the Bank of England so why not just call it that? 
I don't call the CIA the Division of Centralised Intelligence?

It's the 'Bank of England', wtf is the Central Bank of Great Britain?

I honestly don't believe there isn't an ulterior motive to him saying this and it being published by the WSJ.
Anyone who has a problem with banks surely has a problem with major media outlets too

Sure, I suppose, but what happens if the majority decide to pay the highest fees?

Am I the only one expecting a pretty big dip sometime over the holiday period (I'm thinking maybe Boxing day)?
Futures coming in (potential for shorting) + increase in speculative money from Christmas bonuses and gifts (potentially greater numbers of weak hands) feels like a recipe for a dip

If I somehow end up in possession of one of these notes OP I'll be sure to let you know!

This 'crash' will look like a blip on the graph once it recovers, I just want to buy now

Can someone link the guy who said he'd eat his left testicle at $10k, he must be getting pretty nervous...

Bitcoin's valuation has already rebounded, the 'crash' is over

As a relative newbie to crypto-currencies, I have to say I see their value more as a commodity than as a legitimate currency. I think something like bitcoin can replace gold in a new kind of 'gold standard', a commodity against which world currencies can be pegged against to set their values.

Coinbase have really dropped the ball here...
