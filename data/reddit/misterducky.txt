I hope I'm there the day you get scammed out of bitcoins just so I can direct link to this comment. 


You don't need a bank account to use a debit card either. Prepaid debit cards are a thing. Also, by "anywhere fiat is accepted" do you mean "The 37 states where shift is available"?

Yeah, sounds like they know, considering they were the ones who closed your account.

I mean, to be 100% fair, Guantanamo is in Cuba, not the US.

So why didn't you?

I always hear this line parroted, but why? Why should the merchants add a discount for using a currency that is harder for them to use? People offer discounts for using cash because it avoids credit card transaction fees, and, you know, it's cash. What incentive does bitcoin offer that merchants should be offering discounts over real money?

Dear god, why? Those people have zero say in what happens. They probably just nod and say "Yes sir" until they can get you off the phone, until they can turn to the person at the next desk over and say "That lunatic called about Bitcoin again."

"Anonymous Credit"
You must not understand the definition of one of those words, or potentially both, because they are contradictory.

It should be noted though, any taxes you pay to another government while overseas, offset the amount of taxes you have to pay to the US Government, at a dollar to dollar basis. If you owe the US government $2000 in taxes one year, and you paid the Turkish government $1800 in taxes that same year, you would only need to pay the US government $200.

Lawyers aren't allowed in small claims court, which both of those sums most certainly would fall under. $1500 is not some media sensation making fee. Most people don't care about bits^Coin. They'll ask their friend who knows a *little* about it and say "Oh yeah, someone lost $1500 imaginary internet money."

I mean, have you see how many posts here are "MY WALLET GOT HACKED, LOST ALL MY COINS!!"

But the automobile did get rid of the horse...

Yeah, cause no one could just load dollars into an account and just subtract that from a balance without needing to confirm future transactions with the CC company. ONLY BITCOIN CAN PROVIDE THAT... but only after you wait 10+ minutes for the transaction to confirm.

Yeah, because people who have the resources and abilities to intercept shipments via the federal mail system would definitely have their efforts confounded by the lack of a working type A to Micro B usb cable. 
Paranoids like you are hilarious, simultaneously assuming the people "out to get you" are both supremely powerful, and completely incompetent.

I'm pretty sure Napster is the Napster of filesharing.

It's a line from a book called consider the fork. Food history and such. Can't claim it as my own.

Even taxes can be avoided, if you don't make any money.

Just like Bitcoin!

Really? I would have expected them to talk about how Ron Paul is the only suitable candidate for president in 2016, and also how being a moderator of is GOOD FOR BITCOIN! UP UP UP!

Yeah, what could go wrong if I accidentally cheat customers who have no idea who I am because they bought drugs from me from an online anonymous marketplace. 
Considering bit^Coin's storied history of exit scams and SFYL moments, I'm surprised you're putting so much faith into people you're doing business with. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:08:44
That was used to prevent brush-ups with the law, to make sure you weren't accidentally cheating customers. I doubt anonymous drug dealers and their inherently extralegal transactions were super worried about that.
