Yes the cost is paying for mining, which is compensated via block reward.
Fees were only supposed to be high (greater than say, 10 sat/byte) after the block reward disappears, according to Satoshi's original whitepaper.

Depends how you define consensus. Not everyone wants LN (or rather, not everyone wants blocksize to be static until LN comes out), but those that favor LN before blocksize increase tend to be in the BTC camp, and others tend to be in the BCH camp (that's a rough explanation, there are many different opinions)
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:19:17
It's not like BCH will be stuck at 8-32 MB forever. Slow exponential block size increase, giving plenty of time to develop L2 without adoption dying.
Hasn't LN been a few months away for years now? It's a cool solution, but it should be a supplement to a healthy blockchain, not something you're forced into because the main chain is crippled.

The fee market wasn't supposed to be here until 2140, according to Satoshi...

@_date: 2017-12-27 23:25:46
It's not even shady, it's just a Bitcoin fork with a different tx malleability fix, larger blocks, and no RBF (which I don't think is a real difference because miners can still choose to RBF if they want to since they have 100% control over which transactions get into blocks).
I know people here love to act like Roger Ver controls the coin, but he doesn't. He's just a dude with a shitty nickname who does a great job (imo) promoting adoption. I don't care about his past, if he supported MTGOX that was a huge mistake but I was never dumb enough to trust mtgox anyway.
It's not any more centralized than BTC is. The miners have always been the biggest risk to centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:15:14
I'm just saying we eventually need a block size increase to scale worldwide. Not necessarily now, although we do need one now if the goal is to lower fees. However if 100-1000+ sat/byte fees are okay, then there's no need to touch the block size at all currently.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:43:15

@_date: 2017-12-25 05:26:24

@_date: 2017-12-27 05:52:50
I don't think BTC is actually being spammed, or at least not nearly to the extent people claim it is.
A real spam attack - to drive up fees, not just to make people include "useless" transations in blocks - requires paying those same fees yourself. Thus it is not very sustainable unless you're a nationstate.

@_date: 2017-12-25 05:54:48
temporarily, sure, but if adoption goes up, then the mempool will get clogged more frequently. because of the way fee markets work, fees can grow at a massive rate. as one example, the pineapple fund guy posted about his troubles with transaction fees, and this if for a multimillion dollar fund.
additionally, real usage means you can't afford to wait a week for the blockchain to clear. of course, if you don't believe BTC should be used for transactions, then this is a non-issue.
Also, even when fees went back down to 200 sat/byte, I've still been getting hammered by fees just because large # of UTXOs =&gt; large transaction size in bytes
also, transaction rate is proportional to hashpower, until difficulty adjustment kicks in and then it goes back to 10 min blocks. so if hashpower spikes and clears the mempool, then if it ever declines significantly (perhaps in line with a price correction) then the mempool will explode again. it's really not a great situation.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:08:17
Yup, people are being pushed over every day. I know because I'm one of them - when your transactions are 1kb+ due to UTXOs (yes, I should have consolidated when fees were cheap, but I took a break from bitcoin and came back to this whole situation), you can't afford to pay 200-1000 sat/byte. And my holdings were [6-8] BTC, so theoretically enough for fees to not hurt as bad, but man do they hurt.
As time goes on, it's clear that segwit's approach to increasing block size is looking less and less viable. Companies can only be pressured so much, after a certain point they're going to take the easy route.
As an unrelated digression, nobody should have been surprised with Coinbase's move to BCH. Brian Armstrong does not like Core at all after the whole BIP 101 mo.der.ation fiasco

Off-blockchain transactions can be censored. 


Because block size and transaction throughput are one in the same until you bring L2 online. Satoshi knew that, which is why he considered blocksize increases to be so obvious that he didn't foresee what would happen to the community.
**Even the LN whitepaper accepts that 1.7MB is not enough for worldwide use**

LN needs "bigger trucks" (bigger roads is a better analogy, btw). The LN whitepaper posits &gt;100 MB for worldwide adoption. So, it has to happen eventually, why not start now?
(I actually want BTC blocksize to stay down, since I liquidated my BTC. But anyone who supports BTC, imo, should want blocksize to increase at a reasonable rate)

forex trading implies currency. is bitcoin a currency or not?
bitcoin is not 'forex trading software', it's a currency (electronic cash).


As a TEMPORARY measure. He specifically said that Bitcoin "never really hits a scaling limit" and that to scale up, block size would be gradually increased until Bitcoin matched the visa network.
Now, you can say he was wrong about the approach, but it is disingenuous to say he supported 1MB blocks. 1MB blocks was a temporary limit when BTC was tiny. He fully assumed it would be raised over time, and advocated as such.

Sorry son, that's not coinbase. You probably have "overdraft protection" (it should be called "overdraft rape") enabled. Disable it ASAP, it's just an excuse to steal money from 18 year olds (I know because it happened to me).
Call your bank tomorrow (or go in person), ask them to reverse the fees. If they refuse, escalate to a supervisor. Keep escalating until they tell you to go fuck yourself, at which point you need to close your account right there.
[Also if it was an ACH withdrawal - I don't remember which one coinbase uses - you're probably super fucked. If you bounce the wrong type of transaction, you get charged a fee even without having overdraft rape enabled]

What's your goal with BTC? Are you trying to transact in it (unlikely given fees), or just make fiat?
If you're trying to make fiat, implement a simple algo and stick to it. Something like every doubling in price (starting at your cost basis), sell 10% and put it into traditional financial assets (stocks, bonds, REITs, etc).
This would give you enormous peace of mind, which is quite invaluable. You get to experience some real gains from BTC price appreciation, while still making a boatload if BTC moons. (Plus, if the crypto markets crater, then you have tons of dry powder to buy some cheap BTC)
Or just hodl all of it. Your choice.

Transaction fees / delays are the primary constraint, besides exchange risk like the exchange exit scamming or getting hacked
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:14:05
There is a plan for the next phase...transaction fees. 
It was only when Bitcoin Core came along that suddenly we decided a fee market was a good thing to have over a century before it was supposed to go into play.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:05:37
And vice versa. One big risk for BTC holders is that if the reverse happens - if BTC price declines, then hashrate will (presumably) go with it. This leads to a dropoff in transaction throughput until difficulty swings the other way. The BTC difficulty algo takes a little longer to adjust, so there's a longer period of vulnerability.
A related issue, which is brought up in the original XMR (Monero) whitepaper, is that block reward reduction occurs in discrete intervals (halvings). [This applies to BTC, BCH, and all the other bitcoin forks]. This means if you wanted to perform a hashrate attack, you have some nice well defined points at which you can assume hashpower will drop significantly. Still, BTC has such a massive amount of hashpower this seems like more of a theoretical concern.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:51:26
Agreed. This is quite an issue for XMR.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:07:28


Only profitable if you own enough of the mining power. Not sure on specific numbers, but I would assume you'd want 50%+ to do such an attack.


Briefly, sure. It just seems a little silly, because BTC's already gonna kill itself over time, so why try to artificially inflate fees when they'll inflate anyway?


Yeah, that could be an attack, or it could be rational people making TX before throughput goes down with the difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:45:11
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:27:21
Sure, but I meant in terms of immediate changes. Fees will only really go down with LN, and even then we will need to increase blocksize dramatically to scale to the whole world. The LN whitepaper says as much
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:32:44


But not adopted...


That's good. Do they have an ETA? We still don't have segwit in core's GUI.


Can BTC afford to wait 12 months? "Activated" is different from widely used and reducing fees, btw


Eventually, sure. But that's very far away. Right now BCH has 8-32 MB blocks (well, closer to 2-8, but raisable to 32 without hard fork, and after that there will be plenty of hard forks (which I just call 'forks') to come).
You have to understand, BCH isn't incompatible with payment channels. It's just different focuses - the BCH side believes we should not let tx fees spike and the mempool skyrocket while awaiting LN.
[Pointless aside: I didn't downvote you]
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:36:27
Your claim is naive.
To raise tx costs, I must pay the actual tx fees. This makes such an attack very expensive.
It's viable for a nation-state, not so viable for a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:25:22
Imagine if reasonable blocksize increase + malleability fix were a HF. With Core's control of the discussion, it would have been so easy for them to rally support with it, and then we would see much better adoption as opposed to the current segwit adoption rates (adoption is improving, but slowly, partially because there's still plenty of work to be done on the dev side)
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:00:44
Probably never would, or at least not for several years.
Bitcoin is built off being an open blockchain. We'll likely see two main categories of blockchains (open/closed)
XMR is great because while there's default privacy, you can also choose to expose a tx by providing a special view key that lets someone view the actual tx. (Or you can set your ring signature to just have yourself, which is basically an openly viewable transaction like with bitcoin)

And, critically, they're not against getting even bigger trucks down the road.
L2 is fine, but people shouldn't be *forced* into L2 by arbitrary blocksize cap. Right now, the actual blockchain is only for the privileged first-world speculators. Hardly a revolution. It's just a repeat of the same centralist financial system.
I mean fuck, LN is basically reimplenting checking/saving accounts, just the bitcoin version. Don't get me wrong, it's very cool technology, but we shouldn't be forced into LN because "oh, we ran out of bytes!" when the blocksize limit is completely arbitrary.
LN is so cool, but became so uncool as soon as Bitcoin Core decided that the main chain should die.

Why does everyone in the subreddit do this? I'm just trying to have a real discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:35:01


This is false.
It makes "witness data" considered only 1/4 of its real size in bytes. Thus it only increases tx throughput in proportion to how much witness data is in the average TX.
Most models seem to predict around 1.7MB +- .1MB for normal usage, with full segwit adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:29:35
Why? And who decided that it wasn't the right way forward? Clearly not the community.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:33:02
Not really. Segwit is itself a block size increase, in tune with adoption.
This is because the witness data is considered 25% of its real weight in bytes. Thus transactions are not smaller, but blocks are bigger. (the other component of segwit is malleability).
So yes it's a different way of increasing block size, but it's still a block size increase (this, to me, is inarguable)

If you check price 100 times a day, it will gradually drive you crazy.

However, it is important to note (I think you already know this, but for others) that in the medium term, ie after difficulty adjustment, blocks go back to 10 mins average. And then if hashrate drops from there, block times get above 10 minutes average
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:21:53
Yes, thank you for stating the obvious. Obviously it has not been done in Bitcoin, otherwise I wouldn't have said that other coins did it
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:38:14
Miners aren't complicit with spammers. They are incentivized to select the highest fee tx.
Watch the mempool, when it gets clogged you see the 1000 sat/byte disappear first, then 900, then 800 etc. (You also see the 10sat/byte ones disappearing from the bottom, but that's eviction, not them being included in the block)
For it to be worth it to spam the network with high fee tx, you must have a huge proportion of mining power. Do you disagree with this assertion?
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:01:07
Okay, but why does it have to be one or the other? Why not blocksize  + payment channels, since that is what LN will require anyway?
You don't really think BTC will stay at 1.8 MB forever, do you?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:41:24


I understand that position. However, fees are directly related to transaction throughput, thus they are directly related to block size. Of course some feel that the block-fee-reward should be higher than the actual block reward, in which case a blocksize increase would be a bad thing so we can maintain the high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:39:58
Yes, I agree. Segwit will not fix fees. It's also a much larger change than a naive block size increase, so of course adoption is difficult.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:55:33
I don't check prices either. Waste of time.
Try to channel your energy productively. I spend it learning about components of Bitcoin, blockchains etc. Right now I'm writing a python script to try to model what happens to BTC fees - and hashpower - if the price declines significantly. There's an interplay between blocksize, difficulty adjustment, transaction throughput, fees and mining profitability that is very interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:29:34
To be specific, in the short term fees would decrease far more than 30% if we went to full segwit adoption. This is because the mempool is like a drain getting filled up with water. A slightly bigger drain can be the difference between an overflowing sink, or an empty sink (it's a differential equation). Long term, the mempool would fill back up with usage and fees would go back to very high levels. Thus you either need to keep increasing block size, or go to L2 (or both)
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:31:00
By sidechains, I mean LN, for example. Which is most definitely a sidechain, no?
Saying the fee market arrived in 2012 is a little silly. What was the average transaction fee in 2012?
What's the average transaction fee now?
Take the log of those two numbers divided, what kind of growth rate have we seen?
Better yet, take the fees from 6 months ago, and fees now, and calculate growth rate.
It's a massive exponential.

You think the chance of a BTC price correction is low?
This seems odd, considering a correction in the whole crypto market, without even a particular correction for BTC, would cause this effect...
EDIT: On second thought, the drop in tx thruput would cause fees to skyrocket, which would actually keep mining profitability high. Thus my thesis may actually be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:13:04


Can you explain *how* I'm wrong?
With the exception of shrinking tx size, you have two options that I see: increase blocksize, or scale off-chain. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:38:40


Please please please give a citation for this. I've seen this claim repeatedly in this thread - where did you read it?
Segwit makes witness data considered to be 25% of its real size in bytes, allowing up to 4x the **witness data**. But witness data is only a portion of transaction size. In the real world, we expect around 1.7MB blocks (in real size) with full segwit adoption for average transactions.
The other issue is that it's not really cheaper to run a full node *if you actually transact on-chain*. The 100-1000 sat/byte transactions will add up quickly to be more than the costs of increased bandwidth and storage space.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:58:06
How does open source work, exactly?
[Please, at least read this comment before downvoting]
Bitcoin Core came in because Gavin trusted them after Satoshi left the scene, then they turned around and kicked Gavin out (from what I understand, I may be wrong) and took over development.
If 'bcash" (Bitcoin Cash) has no right to call itself Bitcoin, because they "stole it from Core", what right does Bitcoin Core have to call itself Bitcoin, when they are themselves a derivative of Satoshi's codebase?
imo, anyone who's actually a coder and is familiar with the most basic of vcs concepts doesn't find forks hard to understand. it's just running a "git clone", making some changes, and pushing to your own repo.
The way I view it, is Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash are *both* forks of the 'original' Bitcoin. I think anyone being honest would agree that Satoshi did not support 1MB being a hard cap (or ~1.8MB with segwit). Now, it's not like we have to do everything Satoshi said, but I think people forget how brilliant they were. They did a lot more than "hashcash with inflation control" (a stunning mischaracterization of bitcoin). They created the first decentralized, trustless system that solves double spending with clever economic incentives.
Satoshi was very convinced that Bitcoin "never really hits a scaling cap", and could scale to Visa levels. Then out of nowhere, we have a very vocal faction who claims that this isn't actually possible (a faction, by the way, who wrote Bitcoin off despite some of them being included in the OG mailing list).
So, we have two competing vision of Bitcoin (technically we have more forks, but BTC and BCH are the only worth following since everything else is either a shitfork or an outright scam). One is unusable on-chain currently, but has some very cool ideas for future scaling (emphasis on future, LN is not production ready today, despite what people say), and the other is completely usable on-chain.

Whether it will displace *all* money or not, it's best not to cripple (or discourage, if you prefer that word) its usage for on-chain transactions.

My issue is, I would rather have a "less secure" system that is actually usable, than a "secure" one that is not. I'd rather pay 1 sat/byte than 100 or more accurately, 1000 sat/byte when the mempool is clogged. (Of course, the ultimate goal is a secure, usable system, which I still believe *CH represents)
I'm worried that high fees will slowly kill actual BTC usage, which means that eventually, the fees won't even matter.
But yes, there would be an equilibrium between fees and hashrate due to the impact on mining profitability. Still, if fees go so high that it causes a panic because even with massive fees, users can't actually get into blocks, then we'd have this nightmare scenario where eventually the whole thing just collapses and dies. Fortunately for them, most users keep their coins on exchanges, so they would be able to convert to fiat until either the exchanges went down or the value of BTC plummeted too far. Also fortunately, the probability of this 'nightmare scenario' is quite low. But it's still there, IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:08:14
You misunderstand. You're talking more about the long-term vision for BCH, which could feasibly *eventually* scale to TB blocks (TB blocks are often misconstrued here tho. This is a theoretical, "what if the entire world used BCH and we wanted everyone to transact on-chain scenario", ie wouldn't happen for a decade or much longer)
BTC's vision is to scale off-chain, with segwit+LN. This requires a larger blocksize, but not nearly as large as full on-chain scaling.
Personally I favor the BCH approach, because I am interested in uncensorable payments that do not require prior liquidity. LN has a lot of drawbacks, mainly that you need to pre-fund networks which has a centralizing factor. It's a great solution for a certain type of transaction/use case, but I don't like how it's being pushed as appropriate for nearly every transaction except massive movement of money.

Well, if we assume LN hubs are rational, they must expect better or equal risk-adjusted returns than being in a traditional asset class.
As to what this means per transaction, no idea. If they consider LN "safe", then they'd be okay with 3-4% returns. If not, then 6% minimum per year.
I assume this gets amortized over the expected # of LN transactions, but no one knows.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:50:55


Of course it is!
Anyway, we can add more lanes in the meantime (because unlike real lanes, adding lanes is free and can be reverted at any time with consensus), and *also* work on high speed rail! It's not very useful to have LN if BTC adoption has died by the time we get there. We need both, considering we'll need 100MB+ blocks for worldwide adoption with LN anyway
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:28:22
But Segwit only improves fees as a side effect of its block size increase. For example, most models suggest around 1.7MB blocks with full segwit adoptin for standard transactions.

You can use GDAX to send to their wallets, but they will still not be able to send from their own wallets unless fees improve.
Unfortunately .001 BTC is far too little to be practical. Bitcoin fees are only reasonable if you have $20,000+ in BTC, consolidated to a single output.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:29:24
Can you explain, then? I'm probably not as smart as yourself. I don't do well with subtlety.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:26:10
Bad engineers blame the users. Good engineers make it so easy that even the stupidest user can't fuck up.
Fees *are* high, and it is an issue for real users. Blame it on who you want, but if block size and transaction malleability weren't wed together the way they are in segwit, we wouldn't be here. I would have preferred ripping off the bandaid and going to 2MB, but obviously consensus wasn't with me (or rather, I wasn't with consensus)
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:08:25
I am not an expert either, but it does not make sense to me that witness data is hashed but not stored. You must store witness data to validate tx. The witness data is stored, the transaction id (which is a hash) is the hash of the block, so the non-witness parts. If you only stored the hash, you could never recover the individual witness data, so how would a non-mining full-blockchain node verify the tx?


I'm having trouble understanding this, particularly the last sentence. What is the segwit wallet hashing in the first place to check against?
I believe the confusion is that witness data is weighted as 25% of its real byte size. I don't see how, for example, segwit eliminates UTXOs in a transaction. If you could send me some screenshots of the pages you were referring to that would help (I'll tip you $2-3 for doing so, but I don't have BTC right now so you'd have to accept an alternate like XMR or the 'altcoin' that shall not be named)
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:03:33


Who told you that?


What's silly about it? The fact that it starts adjusting way faster than BTC's (which could be dangerous, or could be beneficial)?
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:43:27
Why does everyone jerk IOTA so hard?
I get holding it to make money from greater fools, but it's really quite useless as an actual crypto. I read the whitepaper (well, 20% of it, it's so long) and immediately wondered how the hell their transaction processing actually worked. It makes sense why they need a centralized scheduler.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:28:45
I don't understand why people will disagree with me here, and tell me I'm wrong, and I very clearly ask for *why* I'm wrong, and then I get this kind of response.
Why are you more willing to respond over there than here? It's really not that difficult of a question I asked you. I'll offer you $1 of XMR if that changes anything :P
Why this foolish dualistic, tribalistic, us-vs-them mentality? I don't refuse to discuss things with people that disagree with me.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:48:09


God I get so depressed whenever I read stuff like this.
Displacing national, centralized currencies is **the central reason Bitcoin came into existence**. It's only after the fact that it was "decided" that it's a store of value that should work within the existing fiat / centralist government systems.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:38:45
That's a little disingenuous. Look what happened to BIP 101.
If I pull requested a blocksize increase, it would obviously get denied.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:05:00
I see you've learned your negotiation tactics from Bitcoin Core's best.
"2-4-8 MB. Actually, only 2MB, and only after segwit. Oh, you're proposing Segwit2X? Actually I never wanted that blocksize increase, thank you very much."
Come on, surely you have an opinion on the eventual fate of our universe. There's no need to be so closed off.
I like you, you remind me of myself before I took shrooms. Clearly some level of intelligence, but a certain amount of...closedoffness, if you'll accept me creating words.
You see, I am clearly not a sh*ll, because sh_lls aren't capable of this kind of discourse. Thus, there is no need to have your guard up. It's no way to go about life.

Use the caret (\^) for TM. For example: Coresensus^TM , Tabs^TM .
Have you read the original whitepaper? I think that's a great place to start.
Satoshi never intended for the fee market to become dominant until 2140, or slightly before that. Unless I'm wrong, we're in the year 2017, and the fee market is in full swing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:33:49


Long-term, I want a smooth, exponential blocksize limit increase. So we grow at the rate of e with a constant that equals transaction growth. If LN is really ready in a few months, then that'll buy enough time. If it takes 18 months, it'll still buy enough time. If it takes 5 years...
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:41:35
Ugh. You're doing the distortion I kindly asked you not to do.
What could the first quote be talking about, if not block size? What other "scaling" is there? He's talking about scaling block size and the ramifications it would have on computing power needed. Otherwise he wouldn't be talking about moore's law. In a separate quote that I didn't post, he also talks about bandwidth.


your quote:


@_date: 2017-12-25 06:12:42
I would like to discuss tx size as well. I've heard the claim it reduces tx size, and have been unable to find proof of this.
Does transaction A decrease in *raw size*, or *weight*? The distinction is that "block weight" is the accounting measure that allows bigger blocks with segwit; it's the .25x witness data multiplier I was talking about.
So did Segwit make tx A smaller, or did it make its 'transaction weight' smaller but not the actual 'transaction size'?
(In other news, I absolutely despise the term block weight due to how misleading it is. I get what they were going for, you're "weighting" different parts differently, but I think most ppl read it and assume block size).
Thanks so much for the discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:51:20
Ah, that makes sense. Thanks for the info.
Is this just in the reference implementation, or in the actual protocol itself? ie if you modified the code, could you set it to 0 and still be accepted by the network, or no?
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:57:28
besides, $1 is what I used to pay for a tab in LSD, back in my less legal days. Thus, I value $1 quite highly. $300 is way too much. Plus, that would be almost a full XMR.
Is there any question you would answer? What do you think is more likely, our universe ending in heat death, or the big crunch? ice, or fire? If you dislike dualism, as do I, then what do you think will actually happen?
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:41:03
So silly to say "I've made enough to pay for this meal why we've been sitting here". What, were they checking GDAX every 5 minutes, making sure they were seeing green?
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:31:52
Can anyone explain why this user got downvoted?
As far as I know, the only fee reduction thru segwit is due to the roughly 70% increased block size limit. Malleability is a diff issue which has no relation to fees
