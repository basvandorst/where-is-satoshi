Top item on our home page, dude. **Letter of opposition** filed with CA Senate banking committee. Public on our website before the bill was pulled. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:12:08
You asked to see a letter opposing the bill, I showed you a letter of opposition. Now you change the ask, complain ,and question my character. This is where I have trouble believing you aren't just trolling me and anyone else in this community who agrees with your end goals but takes different tactics, (or fails to stroke your overinflated ego). I'm done, man. Reply as you will; this thread is a dumpster fire and I'm sick of it. Thanks for the change tip, and have a nice life.

I care about protecting this technology with a common sense and pragmatic advocacy strategy; I care not for impressing Bruce Fenton, an incessant and prideful bomb-thrower, who gleefully lobbies Middle-Eastern monarchies while simultaneously pillorying the good faith advocacy efforts of those he should count and treat as friends.
**Edit: changed "Arab" to "Middle-Eastern" because u/bruce_fenton seems to think that "Arab" is slur rather than (as I used it) an adjective describing a geographic region.**

Absolutely, and that's why we say market throughout the post. "Decentralised network of insurance brokers" just made for too long a headline. And yes the parallels to bitcoin are fun.
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:31:30
This is the key battle. A company with full custodial control of your Bitcoin is just like any old centralized money transmitter; they should be treated as such by the law. Where we should draw the line as a community, imho, is when regulations impinge on the ability of innovators to build decentralized tools that would eliminate the need for trusted custodians, i.e. multisig wallets. The CSBS put language regarding what activities would be covered in the [policy statement]( rather than the draft model reg (not sure why) and it's not good, particularly the last bullet: "Services that **facilitate** the third-party exchange, storage, and/or transmission of virtual currency (e.g. wallets, vaults, kiosks, merchant-acquirers, and payment processors)." That could extend to anyone in a bitcoin-related business regardless of custody.

Also seems like paypal was frozen by mismanagement and technological fragmentation until David Marcus came in, [at least according to Forbes]( Zong (now Paypal's Payment Hub) was his startup, got bought by paypal/ebay and he eventually ended up president of Paypal when it became clear that changes needed to happen. This seems like the kind of sudden innovation you'd expect from someone like Marcus.
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:42:18
Exactly. Only problem is that if we've gone down this road of treating custodians as money transmitters (and I don't see an alternative short of just ignoring regulators--which could be a dangerous game) then mtl will need to follow the BSA (unless we get an amendment of that statute from congress -- for which I'm not ever going to hold my breath) and the BSA has a section called the travel rule which appears to mandate the collection and transmittal of all this data. It was written before any kind of open electric push payment protocol existed so it doesn't make any sense as applied. Maybe we can reinterpret the BSA? I'd be interested in hearing what others think. The relevant passage is [31 CFR 103.33(g)]( I read (i)(F) as saying that you only need info about the receiving party if it was provided in the transaction order. If the consumer didn't specify (i.e. just gave a public address pseudonym) then how can the custodian be held responsible for that information and doesn't the regulation exempt them from liability for that data? I've been told I'm wrong but no one has said why or pointed to the statutory/regulatory text I'm misinterpreting.

To be clear, I'm concerned, but I do think early indicators are less worrisome than what we saw with Gox. If that's cheerleading, then I'm happy to whip out the spirit fingers!

I'd say they "power it." If the bulk of the exchange's reserves remain in cold storage, Amazon (even if they wanted to screw one of their own customers) could not seize control and do whatever they want (i.e. "run" the exchange). This is all semantics but "run" can connote ownership and control over key decisions (e.g. how I run my business) and that's definitely not what's going on here.  
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:26:44
Well said. 
have $1 on me, bdangh! @_date: 2015-01-10 17:31:34
Cold storage should remain the same, i.e. keys are not on an internet connected sever or device; cloud or no. The hot wallet keys would probably be best on AWS, honestly their security (if properly utilized) is going to be vastly superior to anything a small company could build. There's a lot of competition between cloud providers which leads to a healthy industry. I'd rather trust that market than a particular consumer within it (i.e. someone in need of hosting that could either self-provide or consumer). (and of course I'd trust cold storage above all but you can't run an exchange without quick access to liquidity).

Thanks! We've been doing our best to reach out to news outlets that got it wrong. We too have been fed up with the "I like blockchains but not bitcoin" line for some time now, and this story made it impossible not to say something.

One of the existing regulations they would have to comply with is state money transmission licensing, and this would replace that with lighter touch requirements.
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:28:53
You should read our analysis. Squashing this bill would only make matter worse. You'd have to squash the money transmission law that has been around for decades in order to get to a point where there is no state regulation of bitcoin companies. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:30:54
At the moment there is no third way on the table. It's either DBO applies existing money transmission regulation or the legislature creates a separate regulatory regime for digital currencies. You've been critical of the second option but don't seem to be aware that the first is already the state of play. I merely disagree with your suggestion that CA is fixing something that isn't broken. CA Money transmission law is bad for bitcoin, therefore something has to change, and if you don't like AB 1326 then present an alternative rather than suggesting that the laws we already have are appropriate, and then get CA to pass your fix. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:53:01
You're saying the money transmission licensing that would otherwise apply isn't broken in the case of digital currencies?
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:58:55
As an example of what Coin Center is trying to stress in this debate, the subtitle of this EFF article is inappropriate: "Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto would never have qualified for a license under California’s proposed virtual currency regulation"   Under the present language (and unlike the New York bitlicense) you only need to get a license if you hold someone else's bitcoin for them (a hosted wallet or exchange) so a developer creating a new cryptocurrency (eg Satoshi) doesn't need to get a license. It wouldn't matter if they would qualify or not... The law doesn't apply to them. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:36:05
This is poor strategy from EFF. See analysis from Coin Center:
"In a vacuum, I’d completely agree. This is a nascent industry, regulating prematurely could stunt it, and an absence of rules would not necessarily be a bad thing. But we’re not in a vacuum, unfortunately. It is not correct to believe that digital currency businesses today are not subject to regulation, that AB 1326 would for the first time subject them to regulation, and that if it does not pass then businesses will remain unregulated. It is incorrect to believe that but for this bill there would be an “absence” of rules. California’s Money Transmission Act applies to digital currency businesses today. If A.B. 1326 does not pass, I would expect the Department of Business Oversight (DBO, the equivalent to New York’s DFS) to issue guidance or rules applying existing money transmission licensing to digital currency businesses."
"Unlike A.B. 1326, that existing money transmission statute has no exemption for software development; it has no exemption for non-custodial businesses; it has no provisional license for start-ups; it has no exemption for miners or others who contribute resources to decentralized digital currency networks."
And it would require hosted wallet providers to invest in eligible securities (like state treasury bonds) in an amount equal to all value stored on behalf of its customers. 
"A.B. 1326 gives relief from these onerous regulations to hobbyists, developers, and small businesses. We don’t imagine EFF wants to deny these innovators such relief; we think they’ve dangerously misjudged the implications and unintended consequences of their vocal opposition."

And the statutory definition for stored value and the one for payment instrument include any form of monetary value whether or not state endorsed. The Euro fluctuates in value to the dollar but it's still money transmission in CA to hold and send Euros for Californians. 
Do I like how broad that definition is? Absolutely not. And that's why we support this new legislation that would change it.

They are and would continue to be MSBs. They should register with FinCEN if they are US based and want to avoid potential liability. This has been the case since at least 2013 and would not change in the case of a fork. Note that this only applies, in theory, to those who actually accept bitcoin and transmit it (i.e. bushiness that hold private keys for their customers).
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:13:11
Exactly. The definition is at least narrow: "means maintaining full custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others."
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:33:22
Unfortunately state money transmission laws can [already be used by regulators]( to demand that these companies license. We see this legislation as an important step forward because it limits the types of bitcoin businesses that must be licensed and it does it with law rather than at the discretion (and good graces) of someone at the department of business oversight.  Maybe not a slam dunk, but it's an improvement over the status quo. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:43:03
btw, I also do not personally support a hard fork and Coin Center takes no position. The purpose of this piece was to explain why legal arguments for or against are bunk.
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:50:19
This is a very nuanced question and I am not your lawyer (or anyone else's who may be reading this) (sorry, typical disclosure issue). That said, when you register you register as an MSB (not a bitcoin-flavored or doge-flavored MSB). It is possible, and I do not know the degree that this is the case, that you would want to update your registration documents or reports to reflect a change in business model from one currency to another. That is a question for a practicing attorney in this space, not a policy advocate like myself. Cheers!
@_date: 2016-02-15 17:22:34
Yes, that's a larger discussion that I haven't given much thought to. FinCEN is a regulator tasked with anti-money-laundering policy and enforcement so consumer protection concerns are less relevant to this blog post (but I'm sure they will present very interesting questions if we come to a fork). Sorry I don't have more of an answer for you. Thanks for your questions, and keep watching what we do at Coin Center if you want more info on cryptocurrency regulation. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:35:06
If the resulting network is centralized in practice there **may** be a case to classify members of the network as MSBs, but not the people who write software that those members choose to run under no obligation from the developers to do so. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:33:08
You are referring to the 2013 guidance—where there are distinctions between administrators, users, and exchanges. That guidance is an interpretation of the their rules—the implementing regulations for the Bank Secrecy Act. FinCEN is bound to act according to those promulgated rules or else initiate a rule-making to change them (different that issuing new guidance), and the existing rules cannot be interpreted as covering a person who develops software but does not actually accept or transmit value that substitutes as currency. 
So long as the group that creates a hardfork does not accept and transmit value on their own, they are not MSBs. Whether or not the cryptocurrency that results is "centralized" in practice (because of a lack of competitive mining) is irrelevant so long as the developers limit their activities to writing code and putting it in a github repository (why would we expect them to do anything else?).

No disagreement here; Our goal is to preserve the freedom to innovate using these tools so that -- in the long run -- they can realize their full potential. Should everyone start using Bitcoin right now? For all transactions? no, nor could they with the present rate of merchant adoption. However, it's important that innovative companies be free to build these tools, market them, and make them simple enough for even a password-forgetting Luddite will use them without thinking twice. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:32:07
As a first cut, don't entrust your bitcoin to a questionable exchange (or any exchange unless you've some desire to day trade which is probably a bad idea). Secondly, our report does get into the entirely valid security concerns and how new service providers using better security practices can reduce the risk of theft and fraud: 








Whenever the user’s phone initiates a transaction, the third-party can sign-off so long as it doesn’t look fraudulent. If the phone initiated a transfer of all of the user’s funds out of her wallet to an unknown account, however, this third party could decide to not sign off without some further contact with the user, or some good reason to believe that the phone had not been stolen or the user not manipulated into paying a known scammer.

The question was "What word or phrase comes to mind when you hear the word bitcoin." 10% is pretty high when the question is not leading (no choices offered) and yet that many people independently report the same thing. By comparison "money" and synonyms were the second most chosen word at around six percent.
