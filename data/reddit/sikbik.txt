My current belief has something to do with the current political tensions in south korea. The people realize if they go to war with north korea, their counties economy goes to shit. Crypto would keep their citizens somewhat safe in the short term being in a world economy.

what i don't understand is how can they tax you if you cashed out mined coins? you are still paying taxes on electricity, computer parts, internet....

if you lost everything with one ponzi scam, then why bother with the chance this next one could scam you too?

it all depends on if people treat it that way. It can easily be viewed as bitcoin cash as a checkings acct and bitcoin as a savings acct. Miners are making more money currently through bitcoin cash and currently bitcoin cant handle the amount of transactions without the mining pool we used to have before bitcoin cash.
Bitcoin doesnt have to have a crazy amount of transactions to gain value. You don't see gold exchanged like that.
if you want bitcoin to move smoothly with lower transaction fees, you need miners. Miners simply arent going to mine btc until it becomes equil or greater in profitability than bitcoin cash.

so if bitcoin gold is put into everyone's bitcoin wallet at a 1:1 ratio then why can't you just move your BTC to a seperate wallet so the BTC and BTG are now split up so the BTG can freely move without affecting your BTC?
