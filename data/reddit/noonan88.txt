Chase, those bastards.  First they overtook the legendary BOB, and now they shut you out from your bank that you use to pay off debt and stupid taxes all because you are trying to do exactly that.  Maybe they just want you to file for a different type of account.  So many criteria you have to meet with those guys.  Again, good luck.  And GOD SPEED

Riding Bitcoin is a lot like going down this tunnel with Willy
....not a speck of light is showing
so the danger must be growing
.....are the fires of hell a glowing
is the grizzly reaper mowing?

Definitely go to the doctor.  I don't know about you but a Boner is only fun for less than two hours
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:05:34
you aint no man, bra
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:30:13
I clicked it, watched for 30 seconds.  You actually listened to that guy for 2 hours? 
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:01:48
I would agree, but the infrastructure is in place.  Jobs was never good at managing the business side, but he was great with innovation and ideas.  The ideas and innovation will remain until a new player enters the market, or an existing one steps up their game.  Still a great investment

I think this guy will be going to jail regardless

You will have a small penis forever.  Get used to it, no one else will

Did it pass?  (I know it didn't)
Only WA, CO, OR, AK and D.C. have legalized it.

You may think that, but unless you are a giant whale I do not think they would even take a second look.  Fuck, even if you are a big fat whale, I don't think they'd care.  Give them a call and get back to us.  If it really is because of crypto then this would be big news.  
@_date: 2014-06-25 07:26:39
It would still be great investment today
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:13:22
OHHH BANNANNA
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:32:05
I still do it.  Is that wrong?
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:22:03
Be done with it then?  
How will the results affect you, or anyone else anyway?

I have a high level of confidence that he lost people a lot of money.  That's all that matters
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:57:42
Forget about it.  Who cares?

schadenfreude: my new favorite word
How could you not enjoy schadenfreude?

Well he wouldn't be if he was in jail.  So since he is not in jail, yes.  He shouldn't be killed for it though, but certainly be afraid for his life.  Nothing like a good dose of fear

Haven't you read Elon Musk's statements about Artificial Intelligence.  You better watch out guy
@_date: 2014-07-03 01:23:33
Do you have a link where I can purchase bananas with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:35:09
It has nothing to do with crypto.  Sucks though.  Good luck!
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:54:45
Wait. I'm confused.  What the fuck are you talking about?  The CIA?  Why wouldn't you be overjoyed that Tim Draper got them?
Also, this community needs to stop using we and us.  You're an individual, use your brain and make your own opinions.

Try "butthole".  A lot of people use it as their password.
