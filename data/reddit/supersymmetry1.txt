Why would anyone even sell their BTC? If no one ever sells, it rises and all get lambos!! /s

They declared bitcoin as a store of value, so no one is transacting with it, you need to look at another version with small fees and more speed if you want these transactions.

thx, now it makes sense

There is still time to mine bitcoin cash...

In sum: mining and make money is more important than the users of the network you are actually validating. That's his argument...

I believe you. Bitcoin is not a game for small miners anymore for a long time already. But we need to wait the EDA fix which is going live for BCH soon.

False, it did happen, BTC is a minority chain in hash power now, 38% only: sauce:

Agreed. Not everything is code or technical, there is much more to it, even more important is how people want to use bitcoin and what they want it to be. This argument, in this specific context, is akin to say that physicists need to decide which metal is the better store of value, so to speak, not people/users/economic agents themselves.

Why don't you come to Bitcoin Cash already? Let's evolve from there.
