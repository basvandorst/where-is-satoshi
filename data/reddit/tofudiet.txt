Those quote applies when buying at 3k and selling now. Not applicable at 10% action.

Don't spend anymore. When markets are like this people make bad decisions. Take a step for now.

There you go. 5 Euro a month is a much better decision than purchasing right now during a pump.

I cashed out at 18k last time... Been around for a while...

This is what happened with me. I bought Bitcoin in 2014 ish bc I thought it was just cool and then moved over to investing in traditional markets.

Damn, is this what it has come to?

I remember in 2013 a guy came into the bar I worked at and introduced me to the whole concept of crypto so I bought a little bit (not half as much as he was telling me to) but ended up 15k up from slowly adding to it. I remember some time last year he showed up again and was like "...so did you do what I told you?" Hahaha

I didn't know you could travel somewhere and withdraw fiat of that country.  Actually, I didn't know you could withdraw from bitcoin atms anyway...

I've been so interested in reading snowcrash. I'm reading Anathem right now and love it!

that's great.  Paper wallet is probably the best?

Oh I misunderstood. Tbh I forgot Robinhood has crypto. I was thinking about their stock side. Like you don't actually own the stock through their service. It's an "iou" of that stock.

I bought all his drinks for a week hahah
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:12:46
Is that how it is with Robinhood? I keep my Bitcoin in a cold wallet but Robinhood is like an "iou" for stocks?
