Any reason why you kept it on the site and not in your own secure wallet?

Thank you for this!

ITT: People who trusted MTGOX unequivocally with all of their bitcoins in an unregulated system.

Best to see it yourself. Go to  and enter "young girl spy movie." The results speak for themselves.

Or bought in within the last year. I could see people being pissed if they bought in to Bitcoin during the 1k+ bubble. I bought in when it was ~13$.

Play the game and it links you to the blog at the end.

Very cool!

And did not have 2FA enabled...guess over $10k was not enough to warrant some additional security.

Shit crop, you cut out the time scale on the bottom showing 2 weeks time.

Of a recent $1900 bonus $500 of it ended up in bitcoin  that was a good choice lol I plan on putting in more, probably only a few %.

Anyone else hear anymore information about this? Cannot seem to find any other chat about this online.
Edit: Site seems to be back  up.
Edit2: I lied - site is all kinds of messed up.

The video is way too short. Need to add in at least a week or two time for them to finish processing the 'pending' transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:11:29
They also just announced that any and all transactions are going to take longer than normal so make that 2+ weeks for anything to process. Probably the worst time to send people to Coinbase.

This just makes me sad. I bought ~11BTC back when it was worth ~$10 a piece to buy some....stuff...off silk road. Annnnnnnd now it would be worth a couple thousand dollars.

Have you tried  or to trade on mycelium?

Guy did not expect someone to take the image clean it up and make it available in Bitcoin Communities. As stated elsewhere after he broke 2 BTC he donated the rest, so not really begging for tips.

If only the other branches of our fucked up government were as blindly passionate towards their cause...shit might actually be fixed.

You should refresh your page. One of the top posts right now on the subreddit disproves your argument:

And yet they are concerned enough over this 'newfangled fancypantsy "internet money." ' to threaten a customer with closing their account.
