Yeah, one's a dying market grasping for anything as it falls, the other is booming.
You figure out which is which.

Use the app Circle Pay.
You can buy the smallest most trivial amounts of Bitcoin with practically zero fees. Sending and receiving is a dang breeze.
I've done it numerous times, using a CC and have provided minimal verification info. (No ID or anything)
I'm in the states however, if that makes any difference.

My experience with Circle began after the first attempt to buy BTC.
I registered with very very little personal information and naturally a payment source to buy/exchange fiat (debit card). All was legit, transaction not declined.
Amount started at 0.01 just to see how quickly turn-around time was. Now, typically pull out .2 - .5 a month and transfer to another wallet.
Will continue to use.

Once it's in your Circle wallet, press send funds. 
From here you can manually enter any wallet address you desire and send funds. 
If you ever need to send money back to your Circle wallet, you can do this as well.

Get the app on your phone as that's how I personally did everything.
You may potentially be able to do this on the website, but I'm not certain. 
Look for "Add Money", then designate how much. 
This will add money to your Circle wallet in USD. Once you've confirmed it's there, go to settings, and look for "Currency - US Dollars" and from here you can instantly convert your USD to Bitcoin as I described previously.

Doesn't Bodog operate within the EU? 
AFAIK Circle and apps like it, only take issue with American users (wallets) being used for betting as it's still considered illegal within the US. In the EU it's not illegal, and I'm fairly certain several users from there, have posted to this board reporting no issues transferring funds back and forth between Circle and casino wallets. 
If this was taking place on Bovada, reporting would make sense, but not exactly wrong for Bodog to recommend this method.

Can I not suggest the app, Circle?
You can get it on Android &amp; iOS. Tie either a bank account, credit or debit card to your Circle account, and purchase bitcoin without ANY fees.
It's the absolute EASIEST &amp; cheapest solution to getting your hands on Bitcoin if you're located within the US. 
It's always cheaper than LocalBitcoins because the sellers there are trying to make a little money....
*edit*: you can add money to your circle wallet with your debit card, say $50 USD. Once it's confirmed in your account, typically within seconds, you can instantly convert it to bitcoin (based on the current BTC to USD rate). 
Once you've converted, you send the money to your own personal wallet if you so desire, or just use the Circle app as your wallet. I personally use my own wallet and just use Circle as my medium to purchase Bitcoin without fees. 
You can also convert your Circle wallet from Bitcoin back to USD at any time without any fees. It will simply convert based on the current (at that time) conversion rate of BTC to USD. You can always check these rates via Google, by just typing for example; .25 BTC to USD
Good luck!

Lol, buddy. I just logged into the Circle website on my PC, and first thing I see on the Home Page is 
"ADD MONEY"
It's a green button, right below your account balance which should currently be 0.00
Having the app will make your life easier I believe, but you CAN add money with ease, I think you're making this a lot more difficult than it really is.

That's not how it works at all, so just slow down.
I've deposited money from a debit card, and a credit card. 
Converted from USD to Bitcoin.
Transferred back/forth between wallets, many times over.
Last but not least, withdrawn back to my crappy bank account, twice now, without providing my ID.
Your experience &amp;/or story does not reflect the rest of ours.

Switch to what? Depending on how you utilize Coinbase, you may have absolutely zero alternative at this point.
What's frustrating for me is, Circle completely spoiled me to bitcoin. Purchasing at the drop of a hat, with little to zero wait times before the instant gratification of more coins into my wallet.
Now, with Circle out of the picture, I go back to Coinbase. I had made an account roughly a year ago, and successfully connected my Bank Acct for transfers. Seeing as Bank Transfers take several days, I went with the Credit/Debit card option as I always had with Circle, and was shot down when their tiny deposits didn't perfectly go through on the first attempt. They attempted to push through 3 small charges... 2 of the 3 successfully going through, and then finally the third being denied because my bank began to suspect fraud. I only noticed/say this because my cell-phone immediately lit up with a text from my financial institution.
This is where my frustration really begins. Due to the 3rd and last charge being denied, Coinbase states that I'll need to validate the card again, and that it cannot be done until 7 days have passed. Seriously? 
Fuck Coinbase and this absolute pain in the ass procedure. I genuinely am saddened by Circle giving up on us. I would have gladly paid a bit higher premium for their services to continue.

Try the mobile app, seems to be working for me.
