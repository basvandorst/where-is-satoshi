It's completely going to change the game. Now that circle exists, there is no way bitcoin can lose. People who could not buy before can buy now because there is no other way to buy it outside drugs. This will show true market value to bitcoin, and speculation will go down.

Circle is just amazing. I basically starting crying and getting very emotional when I started using it because I could see right then the future. Its about giving up what you lost and starting something new. Forget gox. Just Circle.

Sounds like a sly attempt to promote "paxum" by name dropping it. As far as I can tell it cannot interface with Circle and therefore bitcoin, so I don't think you can.

If you don't understand what is special about circle.com, you truly do not understand bitcoin. Circle will completely change the game... imagine a world where money can be sent across borders without restrictions and without anyone knowing about it. That is circle. This is truly the future and if you don't get that then you have a lot to learn.

They will probably be using the circle merchants pages for accepting bitcoin with circle. Since it is the best way for acquiring bitcoin it will be the best way to make bitcoin transactions including purchases like this.

If you haven't guessed, this is the circle.com logo. Circle is going to bring bitcoin mainstream. Why show physical bitcoins if bitcoin is not physical? Circle's logo represents it so much better. They are like apple. They think of the details like this. What would a bitcoin look like? And they make their logo like that. Even the [original bitcoin logo]( is getting stale and this would be better. Since most people will be buying bitcoin from circle anyway, a bitcoin should look like that company.

I really don't buy it. Circle shows the true benefit of bitcoin, in that it is not too different from PayPal. Meaning you just have a dollar balance that is easy to use. Most people don't care about "decentralization."

I think it depends on the bank not the credit card company. There are only like 3 or 4 major credit card companies and I don't think circle does all of them but it doesn't matter, just because buying with a credit card in the first place is so awesome. they will get more eventually. Cards are issued through a bank, so it probably differs from Chase to BofA to Wells Fargo etc. But seriously, I don't even care about a charge because without being able to purchase with a credit card bitcoin is a non-starter in the first place. You can't really use it without that and Circle is the only company you can do that with so give them some credit. You should be willing to take the fee to support them.

This is not fair to circle because it is their launch day and problems under high pressure cannot detract from their truly revolutionary website. It's not like they lost your money or anything. Circle.com is going to change bitcoin permanently I'm sorry you don't see that. You should have just waited til it worked, give them a break.

Circle is really changing the game and this article makes no mention of how Circle's presence will help skyrocket the price of BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:43:50
Circle.com launched to the general public, so yes, DEFINITELY. Circle will make bitcoin ultimately accessible. You will start to see it for remittances and it will skyrocket. Circle is just getting off the ground so give it some time.
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:59:07
I really can't wait for Circle to add this feature. They are dollar-balance oriented because bitcoin is much easier to understand that way. This is why your account says "$10" instead of "0.25xyz BTC" (which is stupid).
@_date: 2014-09-30 07:51:31
All circle needs is to make it easy to buy with a credit card because that is the way most people need to buy bitcoin and for it to succeed. They already do this so I'm not sure what your worried about. Just move your coins off site. This is needless criticism.
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:43:44
Circle should have an integration with walltime where you can order a walltime card through their site with funds straight from your account! This would be an amazing cold storage problem to solve. If circle did it it would give walltime true legitimacy.
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:16:23
What don't you get? For the first time people will be able to really USE bitcoin. Bitcoin was not useable before but it has so much potential. One day everyone will have monetary freedom. We will be able to send money across borders without restrictions, without other people getting in the way. It is the future I really see it. If you don't get that, if you don't see why circle.com is so important why are you here.
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:26:10
I don't think it matters because circle is the only true easy way to use bitcoin,a nd bitcoin itself is the future. Converting btc in other countries will come in due time, but probably not a site better than circle meaning this is just the first step.

Circle has an amazing product to share, mtgox was just the product of a monopoly backed by a man-child. Circle, well we don't know what kind of person that is run by yet but believe me it is so easy to use. Mtgox was in japan. Circle is in boston and uses credit cards. Its a world of difference, circle is going to take bitcoin to jupiter.
@_date: 2014-09-30 07:27:51
Ugh, when Circle launches in AU you won't have to deal with this.
@_date: 2014-09-30 08:16:02
People need better access to bitcoin before large merchants will spend it and this is why Circle is so important. If they didn't exist bitcoin would fail.
@_date: 2014-09-30 08:37:12
Circle is here now, just start over on there. Getting anything back from gox is unlikely.
@_date: 2014-09-30 08:01:52
Circle is really good and I don't know why anyone would question that. Some will say "blockchain.info is easy too and you get to control the private keys" but I'm not sure they understand exactly how good Circle is. Circles simplicity makes users less confused which basically equates to another kind of security.
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:02:45
Circle is live. This is what bitcoins are going to look like in future news articles:
Seriously folks if you have not signed up yet then you are not participating in bitcoin. Circle has what bitcoin needs to go to the next level. Forget the moon, it's time for mars and that logo is what it looks like. Can't wait.
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:29:11
If you think circle.com isn't going to completely change the game for bitcoin, you don't understand anything about bitcoin.

Yeah but their vault charges a fee to use (something like 2% per year!) and the debit card was sketchy as hell.
