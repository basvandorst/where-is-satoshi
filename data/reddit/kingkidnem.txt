I'm sad to say this but I agree. Infact, people trying to "make money" off of this proves that bitcoin cannot sustain these levels in the long run. The fundamental purpose of bitcoin is to DISRUPT and DISBAND fiat, so you should be investing in bitcoin as is, another long term currency, not just to make a quick buck and pull out once the price sky rockets. People are in bitcoin for the wrong reason. I was excited about bitcoin but now I see it's just completely turning into a ponzi scheme. Sad.

With all due respect, Bitcoin has a different fundamental purpose than stocks and real estate. Bitcoin is a currency that is supposed to replace fiat in the long term, not to be converted back to fiat when the price goes up, which is what it's trying to replace. That defeats the purpose.

Lol a bubble has nothing to do with percentage of use. It has to do with hype, supply, and demand at a given time period AND sustaining levels at a given price level. Not everyone was in the housing market during 07-08 yet it was a bubble. Not everyone was trading internet stocks during the dot com boom yet it was a bubble. Bitcoin IS a bubble at certain time periods when the hype is too high to supply the demand of the coins (which pushes the prices up) AND when price levels aren't able to sustain the levels they're being traded at (because of the high demand for that time period). However, in the long run, it isn't a bubble when prices start to level out. Not only that, no one knows which crypto currency will prevail in the years. For all we know it may be some unknown crypto or it may be evenly split amongst the top 10 or 20. Who knows. No one can predict the future.

I have to agree. I think bitcoin will be the sacrifice cryptocurrency and will be replaced by other more efficient cryptos that are able to solve the issues and fundamental problems that bitcoins have, especially getting people on board to begin with. Crypto currencies do have a future but they're far too ahead of their time to be a legitimate currency, which is why I referred to them as a long term investment. I think the blockchain technology is more important than the cryptos themselves.
