What makes Robin Hood better than say scottrade or other traditional stock brokers?

my dude, take the time to do some research before you invest in anything.  Buying/selling coins based on what a few folks on the internet tell you is the best way to lose your money.

Many exchanges have withdrawal limits.  See if they can increase yours if you provide additional verification.  
In the future it’s good to be aware of this going in.

Do what you are comfortable with.  If it crashes and you lose it all will you be ok with it?  If it goes to the moon and you sold and could have been a millionaire overnight, will you be ok with that?  
Everyone needs to do whats right for them.  But if you got in to take a chance at it going to the moon, then hold tight.  If you got in to make a little money, you have done that, go ahead and sell some or all of it.

If you truly think it’s going that high it really makes little difference if you buy now or when it dips.  And even if it does dip who says you will be able to time it right?  No one knows of it will dip or shoot to the moon in the next hour.  So Your best bet is just buying now.

How secure is your phone?  When logging into any exchange from any device you should ask yourself this. Might it have a keylogger or malware?  If you have a rooted device there are many apps that could compromise your phone.  
Personally i dont do any banking on my phone.  But if you feel confident it is secure, then go for it.

THis does raise a good question.  I notice that i have lots of small amounts in various wallets due to buying and selling and minimums.  They are less than the minimum to xfer. How do folks avoid this?

If people sell then yes.  But if they bought knowing they might need to hold as it could crash any moment they should hold long enough to where the market recovers.  They hold for a month and wait they will be rewarded.  But those who panic sell, those are the ones you feel the pain.  Folks shouldn’t be investing if they aren’t prepared to take a loss.

I have seen this in  a few threads.  Can you control how much fee you pay?  I thought that was something you couldnt control.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:44:07
crash?  looks like a sale to me!  
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:17:21
That’s the problem.  If you invest in a known volatile asset money you can’t lose then sell when you fear losing it that is exactly how you get eaten alive.   Those that stand tight will usually end up profiting over time. 
So if you know that you breaking point is losing half and you invest you are setting yourself up for failure.

Usually its the people who try to time it that lose the most.

id talk to a tax advisor if its that big of a concern.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:44:20
no thats why you use a wallet not on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:00:23
only usd is insured.  Not cryptocurrency because its not legal tender.  
So again, if your coins are left on an exchange, and it gets hacked, you will lose all of it.  
TL;DR:  get a proper wallet.  Exchanges arent wallets.
