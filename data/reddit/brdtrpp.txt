Should put all rate hikes and reductions. Cherry picked data is bad data.

Except VR isn't going to be anything like the internet.

This isn't really a "new" feature over a monitor. Just a more immersive experience over a monitor. It may be more enjoyable to some, but it isn't a new function.


This is where I'd see a AR argument. You can go to concerts now on a monitor, may not be as fun but i can still do it. Again I'm looking for something that monitor can't do.


I'll give you this one. But is this such an improvement over a monitor that it's like the internet level affect on the world? That was my whole point.


Already really is feasible. I've worked with comp is that do this already.


Cool. But internet level changing the world cool?


Distance will ALWAYS matter. I've been sent halfway around the world to consult for less than 8 hrs for what could have been done in an email chain. Why? Because no matter how good the resolution is, there will always be a need for physical in person experience.


No matter how good it gets. It will never be in person. I normally am a first adopter. Bitcoin and ETH at 8$, 3D Printing as a career, first PDAs when they weren't cool etc etc. Nothing can replace actually being there. 


Lol. Okay. The internet does all these things at lower resolution. These benefits aren't VR but internet related. Again that was my whole point.


Looks at MMORPG, already can my friend. Just at a lower resolution. My point, VR isn't a game changer, it's just a fancier monitor enabled by the internet which is the game changer here.


This one I had not thought of and will look into it more. I think VR will be for these reason very important, but given i dont know much about these ill trust you on it.


Yup, thank you internet....oh you were talking about VR...sorry my bad.


These are the things i was looking for! Go more into these! All the other crap is just what we have now but more immersive.

Yeah. Totally. Got me! Good job.

Change my mind here.
What can I do in VR that I can't currently do with a monitor?
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:35:57
I just don't see the uses for VR. To me it's just a new monitor.
@_date: 2019-12-30 18:34:08
I'd give you AR. But VR isn't going change much.

Like everything else, does it have a purpose to me?

Look I like bitcoin. But this isn't a good argument.
