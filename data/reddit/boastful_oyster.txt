My first question! Nothing shows support like BTC.

Says the 16 follower Twitter egg account. No one with a reputation on the line openly shits on segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:01:12
Still true

Until the day my Moms uses it, it's an investment not a currency.

Technically if you are the last person to buy Bitcoin for over $1000 in the latest timezone, wouldn't that mean we ended the year at 1k?

In terms of business account that may just differ from bank to bank.
In regards to everything else you said I disagree completely.

Is there a didchinabanbitcoin.com? Might all save us some sleep

At the end of the day a sell wall is just historical info.
If you think btc will increase in usefulness as a store and or means of transferring value, buy.  Otherwise sell. Any other strategy is attempting to game human psychology, which is a much more difficult strategy.

Krugman thinks Bitcoin is "evil"... Has to be doing something right.

The philosophy is currently very unpopular. All media, intended for mainstream adoption, inevitably  goes out of its way to disparage the motivations behind Bitcoin. Then turns around to praise the innovation that benefited from it.
That pandering and defensiveness only means Bitcoin is on the offensive. I'm expecting even more desperate kicking/screaming in 2017.

Is it me or does this sub only get its' China news from Zerohedge?

ZH is National Enquirer for finance

@_date: 2016-12-01 18:55:05
Well that was weird
@_date: 2016-12-15 18:39:55
Sorry I don't mean to call you out personally. They do break stories. It's just everytime I see a ZH link I know Im going to have to double check their claims anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:46:11
Right? Theres just no proof except that we assume there's motive, but I doubt Bitcoin is worth Chinas attention at this point. This stuff is still just conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2016-09-08 23:14:40
Well according to the Evangelists at the hyperledger meetup I attended you are wrong and Bitcoin is for pedophiles.

Going to miss this reoccurring conversation:
"Bitcoin transaction volume is maxed out. It's done."
Me: "do you see problems with SegWit?"
[blank stare] [long pause]
"What's SegWit?"

Yeah AFAIK the payments feature is only for generous people that want to pay the sites they use.

A) I believe Brendan apologized pretty publicly for that political donation you're equating with bigotry for some reason.
B) Brave is enabling people the option of paying for content on their own terms while protecting your privacy.
C) ABP is not going to work forever and that's a good thing. I like content creators. They should be compensated for their work.
D) A lot of your points aren't accurate.
@_date: 2016-10-22 17:29:02
How dare you suggest that the price of btc is affected by anything other than cold hard rational analysis.
@_date: 2016-10-22 22:34:05
China is the new china

Adoption in Russia worth mention:

Bigotry covers homophobia too then I guess.
I agree Brave should eventually give creators more control, but it's beta software and it's definitely more fair than the ABP middle finger solution.
So its not perfect, but their trying to solve a really tough problem with Bitcoin, so lighten up.

Idk the "All ideas I dislike are Facist" argument is pretty compelling.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:07:14
How can I get one of those?

You should post your findings on how to do that for future readers.
