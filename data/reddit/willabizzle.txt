I've heard they are actually quite responsive from other posters in this subreddit.

How about gold? Its not backed by anything, can't be really used... why is it so valuable? Because people see it as a limited resource and a vehicle to store wealth.

Bitcoin is extremely limited. Over half of all possible bitcoin have been mined.

I think you are saying that the only advantage Coinbase has is its ability to let you buy without having the USD funds in your account, then doing the bank transfer after the buy, correct? That is the only valid use case I see as well.

Super nice bike.

go coinbase to GDAX then to your wallet.  its free that way.  I think fees are high due to network businessness.

well I have funds in the wallet now...?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:29
Can't I test it by just trying to install the wallet on another PC? I don't need to do any fund transfers?

I'm too much of a wuss to watch.  How do we know its OP in the video?

Hey all - 
I just tested this, my funds showed up on my new PC but I have a different receive address... is this normal? Does the address not stay the same? 
What if I have an address that everyone uses and I loose access to that wallet instance?

If I have my BTC in a wallet on my PC how will I get the new  Segwit2x funds and the BTC gold?

I got all fluttered and attempted to execute some sells, I am trying to cancel them on their site but its still in my pending transactions, do you think these will go through?
