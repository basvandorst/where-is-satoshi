I'm definitely not an expert by any means, but I would assume that the money is being converted to the dollar after the sale is completed. Since they can't pay taxes in Bitcoin, they will have to deal with dollars. If the price drops, then the price drops for the customer too, so if an item costs $20, and the price of Bitcoin drops, that just means that the customer will have to spend more BTC to reach the value of $20.

Bitcoin was never a meme. People made Dogecoin because they think it's funny to use poor grammar, and they want to keep the Doge meme going as long as possible. It was created for humor. Bitcoin is serious.
