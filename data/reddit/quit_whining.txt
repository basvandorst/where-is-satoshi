Can't believe the dollar is crashing so hard.

According to their page, all users' cash is stored in individual FDIC insured bank accounts.  So even if Coinbase totally folds, you can still get your cash back and their creditors can't touch it.  All their digital assets are insured as well, but one thing you aren't insured against is if someone gets your password and gets into your account.

It's been 10 years since I visited, so it's understandable that I'd forgotten.

They had them at Laguardia this past summer during the US Open.  I ordered my food and drink with one.

Gyft is fast.  I bought a Kohl's gift card after the cashier rang up my total.  Within 10 seconds she had entered the code and it went through, no problem.  Did the same thing buying some lawn chairs at K-mart too.

It means a lot of people can still make a couple bucks GPU mining litecoin and exchanging it for dollars or bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:06:18
Because they're stupid enough to think that a sub making fun of some of them means they aren't allowed to be anti-bitcoin.

I've gotten used to it what with the way reddit is these days.  Even if a couple interested people learn something, it's worth it.  If the downvoters would prefer to remain ignorant, that's on them.

But already confirmed it...

Also not an example of fraud.  Fraud by definition involves deception.  If someone finds your wallet and spends the money in it, that is not considered fraud.  If they make purchases on your credit card, that is considered fraud, because they are deceiving the merchant about being the authorized user of the credit card.

That's probably why they vote-brigaded this sub.  Last I checked the "wtf" submission had over 11000 recorded votes (up+down).  Somehow in a couple hours that thread managed to garner more votes than the combined total of the rest of over the last week.
That post was a 4chan-style raid, nothing more.
@_date: 2014-01-03 14:56:36
Pay cash?  That's what I do if I'm just getting a drink and don't want to deal with the whole credit card process.  I think this is pretty much what anyone who doesn't want to start a tab does.
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:57:37
Losing your wallet (real world or bitcoin) isn't an example of fraud.

I've watched this happen with so many emerging technologies over the last 25 years.  It's just a waste of time to worry about people that are closed-minded and uninformed.
If the people who were developing the Internet technologies that are popular today listened to all the naysayers back when they were developing it, we'd still be stuck on dial-up and the Internet would have continued to languish as a government network.
We just keep doing what we do and things get done.  When we're done the trolls move on to other projects that people are excited about.  You've got the vision to see the innovation that this will bring, so make the best of it and ignore those that don't.

Make a copy before burying it.  Bury the second box over bedrock.  Or just bury the first box over bedrock I guess.

In this case "generic" doesn't mean that it's not unique.  It just means that he didn't go through the extra process of creating a vanity address.  If you read the text over the photos you'll see he encoded his father's name into the address.  Addresses like this are called "vanity addresses" and are by necessity made to order which is why he said he can't stockpile them.
On the other hand, he can pre-mill and stockpile as many as he wants for people who just want a typical random bitcoin address.  Additionally he could mill, paint, and sand several at a time before cutting the sheet, also saving him time and effort in the process.
Hope this explanation is a little better.  :)

I had the opportunity to chat with him on IRC a couple weeks ago about a problem I was having with my mining client.  He seemed genuinely interested in my experiences mining bitcoins over the last year even though I had only been running a 150Mh rig.  In short, he struck me as a very nice guy as well.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:12:07
Somebody notify and he'll take care of this.  There's nothing that guy hates more than reposts
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:45:40
Exactly, and I bet he could knock the cost down further on premade wallets by making them in batches.  They'd be more of a novelty type of wallet though, as you'd want to generate your own wallet if you want one that's fully secure (where you've generated the address and key offline yourself.)  That's where you'd spend the $100 for a custom job.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:17:28
If he was updating it daily, wouldn't he be changing the month but not the year until January 2014?  I'm assuming that's ELee was getting at.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:51:47
I personally would spring for a custom made wallet for just this reason.  However, I think some people would go for the cheaper option if it's just a keychain wallet.  You wouldn't want to store your savings in it though, obviously.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:51:47
Mine hasn't said a word about it.

Sorry, guess I got a little carried away there.

Hmm, isn't there a senator somewhere who wants to audit the Fed?  That guy might not be swayed by Chase.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:50:38
Storing them offline, in a box, underground, is just one option.  You can also store it on a website with 2FA (such as coinbase.)  Whichever makes you feel secure enough.
I probably wouldn't go to the extent that OP has to secure my coins, but I'm glad to have the option if I change my mind.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:06:21
Gyft already has a [Facebook gift card]( you can buy with bitcoins for this purpose.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:23:20
You could make some generic units for a lower price, and still charge full price for custom orders.

There are like three subreddits dedicated to attacking and downvote brigading anything about him, so that probably has something to do with it.

Do we know that they are not buying up fistfuls of it?
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:22:34


It almost seems wrong to call it greed at that point.  More like rational self interest.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:57:07
Well, the reptiles will manipulate Bitcoin to cause a near total loss (90-95% loss) sometime in 2014, probably in September (because Jupiter.)  That will be the best time to buy, as they will begin to slowly establish it as the world currency from 2015-2019.
I just skimmed the paper, so someone please speak up if anything sounds fishy about this analysis.

I guess I slept through it.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:52:35
Despite the "he wants to return to gold" misinformation we always see, Ron Paul actually has for years been advocating for a "basket of currencies."  It seems to me bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) are the first step to offering such a thing to not just citizens of the US, but to the entire planet.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:49:04
Agreed.  Delusional would be better to describe the people that claim to know for certain one way or the other.  WhyAllTheUpvotes seems certain enough to offer free blowjobs if he's wrong according to his post above.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:26:30
I think me calling it a "basket of currencies" instead of "competing currencies" is what confused the issue.  "Competing currencies" would have been a better choice for me to use.

It used to give me an indication of how far along it was downloading the blockchain.  Now I don't know how to tell when my blockchain is up to date.  Am I missing something?

I was referring to the vanity addresses because he said:


He can stockpile some by creating generic (non-vanity) addresses when he's not busy with custom (vanity) addresses.
