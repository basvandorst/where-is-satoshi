Do me a favor and post this as a question on The reason this can't be done is the difficulty is baked into past blocks.  In order for my node to consider the block you give it valid it would have to solve the next hash which includes that difficulty--a crap ton of zeros and the hash.  This requires ENORMOUS hashing power.  It can be done but it will cost you more than my transaction is worth.  
That's the general idea.
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:35:28
The only one struggling is you.  It DOES NOT WORK LIKE that.  Even if you were running electrum, the block headers would be downloaded and you'd know if your transaction went through.  You'd have to be running a custodial wallet.  
I'm serious when I tell you, you don't know what you're talking about.  Spend some time to learn how bitcoin works.

They create money out of thin air and oversee and entire system that does the same thing.  No one really knows who or what they give money to.  They just provide generalized worksheets giving totals that could be totally made up and no one would know.  
They very likely control our political system with this power.  Wouldn't you?   They very likely drive all wars and push anything that helps them maintain this power structure.
Always start with a complaint that banks create money out of thin air.  This hooks many people into loudly proclaiming they don't and when you show them they absolutely do and that's the way the system works, even though they'll still argue, it will sink in over time that it's a scam.  
If you can't know the inputs (new unit creation) your money is a scam.  
  
You can even link to the EU central bank bragging on Twitter about buying your assets by creating money.   
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:12:03
I already did.  You cannot create the hash for the next block without enormous hashing power.  It's that simple.  There is no control of the chain like you're imagining.

You realize there are a ton of POS systems for bitcoin now right?  It's a whole industry.
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:24:42
What you're describing is a custodial hack.  If my POS systems are going to your servers strictly for chain updates, that is a form of custodial access.  WHY would anyone do that?   Still if I run a full node, yes you would have to have a ton of asics to generate fake blocks and have wrangled me into getting access to just your servers.  So you've spent a shit ton of money to kill your own business and I was an idiot to do it like that in the first place.  Plus THIS IS NOT BITCOIN.  This is custodial.  
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:14:41
By the way, do you even understand the "without intrinsic value" distinction?   What is the inherent comparison?
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:12:19
No one uses it that way.  Even Wikipedia has various entries.  Only you use it that way because you read part of a definition and felt like "educating" people.

Absolutely incorrect.  Wealthy people stay wealthy by getting cheap/free loans from their banker connected buddies.  
In an Austrian world, once the Rockefellers spend beyond their means, they are done.  They have to work to get back that money.  They can't go to their banker buddies and get cheap/free loans where they have few consequences if they get repaid.    
You can still get loans and you can still invest in an Austrian world--it's just now you have options and NO ONE is going to give you a loan without consequences if you don't pay it back.  Why?  Because money is now scarce and there are consequences to the lenders.

What third world country.  I'm just curious where these cats go to.  
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:06:17
Look, you're inventing things that aren't possible with pure bitcoin.  What you're describing is a custodial situation that tells you the transaction went through.  That's no different than a POS system currently and of course could be tricked.  
If you run a full node--it simply aint happening.

A bitcoin POS system is absolutely possible.  Hell if you wanted to do it a custodial way like you described earlier where you trusted a central entity you could.  POS system has the public key of your trusted central entity and simply verifies it signed transactions.  That's no different than what you were doing before BUT maybe you want something even better with bitcoin.  Your Bitcoin POS system runs a full node--now guess what--you don't even have to trust your central authority.  
See you can do it either way with bitcoin.  
If you're looking for a problem with bitcoin POS, you don't have to look far though.  Imagine pricing items in bitcoin--YUCK.  You could though price things in your native currency and use bitcoin to settle.

This is Keynesian brainwashing 101.  You go with a deflationary-like currency and everything simply works opposite to how it works now.  Prices drop over time.  Saving is giving yourself a loan.  People also do spend their money.  They spend bitcoin now.  You sell a house now.  It's just you have more choice on what you do with YOUR money and anyone that wants more has to work for it--they can't just get their buddies to give them a free "loan" which waters down everyone elses money (the consequences of defaulting on loans at this level are very few).  All the way up to the central bank level, there are no consequences.  We don't even know when they do it.

Its not the same at all.
Crypto ATM is an exchange dealing with TWO types of currencies--at least.
With bitcoin alone you need no atm.
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:47:44
I'm sorry you're a moron.  Maybe think a little first?
How do you get USD in the first place? 
derpity derp  
What exactly do you think you're doing at an ATM you total goober?  
In case you're unaware, a crypto "ATM" IS NOT AN ATM!  They should call them automated exchanges so idiots like you don't make stupid comments and have a bunch of other idiots upvote it.  
When you put 1 and 1 together, make sure you arrive at 2.  You do NOT need an ATM in the bitcoin world.   As a thought experiment for dunderheads like yourself you could go start a bank that holds peoples bitcoin, build an ATM that spits out paper wallets of varying amounts of the bitcoin you "hold" in the bank.  Of course those would only be good for single use situations so why in the hell would you ever even do that.  
Let me know if the above comments are too difficult for your pea size brain and I'll try to dumb them down more for you.

You're doing better than 9/10 of the population then.    
It doesn't bother me in the least that bitcoin isn't backed by anything or has no inherent value--of course you could argue that since parts of our govt. treat it as real estate and there is an underlying messaging system that it does have inherent value but truthfully it doesn't matter.  
A currency that is truly fair, as bitcoin is, is of extreme value and will only increase as more people use it.

Jesus are you this thick headed.  You cannot alter bitcoin transactions.  You CAN stop POS and bank transactions just by disabling the banks internet connectivity.  You MAY be able to stop bitcoin transactions but only if they don't have access to satellite connectivity.  
DO NOT lecture anyone here on distributed databases.  You don't know what you're talking about.  That's the bottom line.
@_date: 2019-03-19 04:35:39


No you can't  This isn't how bitcoin works at all.  Good luck on your fake chain with everyone knowing the previous blocks difficulty level.  Do you know how much money you would have to spend to pull something off like that?  It wouldn't be worth it.  You have a fundamental misunderstanding on how bitcoin works.  


This is all kinds of retarded.  I mean sure if you have no internet but what is this secured internet bs?  I don't have some secured internet that your'e imagining and it works fine for me.
@_date: 2019-03-19 05:07:57
You can do that with POS, you cannot do that with bitcoin.  Nodes will not accept your fake transactions with bitcoin.   Transactions will simply not work.  
Hell with satellite bitcoin streaming now and satellite transactions, you'd be hard pressed to stop even transactions if people really wanted to make them.

Do you understand that banks create money out of thin air? The bank you bank with creates money and adds it to our money supply.
