They may be exchanging it for USD due to the fact that still not everything can be done with bitcoin. With time, more and more goods and services will be available for bitcoin and then there will be no need for exchanging it to USD.
You are missing the important thing here which is accepting bitcoin, exchanging it for the USD or any other currency does not matter in the long term.

Well, maybe through the community support and marketing. Though your right and I experienced this before. It is still worth giving it a shot!

It does not support locations though.
And does it support bitcoins, I saw it supported paypal so I am not sure if they do support btc.

I really appreciate putting the time to message me about as very few people provide feedback. And I stated at the bottom that I am not asking for funds; just want someone to execute it and will help them for free like facebook likes, marketing it and technical issues in addition to the domain name and hosting for free.
Can you elaborate on the pricerr theme as I explored it well and found out that it suits everything and its creator has made a bitcoin plugin for it so its bitcoin ready as well..
What you messaged me about is totally is not discouraging mate and yeah I think the non profit is interesting as well as I am sure there are many volunteers out there that will help out in such a thing as we all need it.
