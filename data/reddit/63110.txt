- Material things won’t ever make you happy 
- Stacking sats won’t ever make you happy
- Self improvement, self care, self love is infinitely more gratifying and beneficial than anything you will ever have or not have
By bucking the system 4yrs ago (net worth 5K), I started a company and grew it to 60 employees, recently left and sold 1/3 of my stake in a company at a large discount for 500k (have 3M in stock left)
Now I have 300K (taxes!) sitting in TD Ameritrade and Robinhood, paid off my debt.
How am I?
- Happier than I was before starting company due to the satisfaction of working my ass off
- $ is “neat”, but the minimalist lifestyle I adopted over the last 4 years has prevented me from spending a dime on anything but debt repayment (fear it won’t make me happy, and slippery slope of stoking flames of some new quality of life standard)
- Freedom of financial stress that weighed on me is nice (Months ago I was 50K in debt and worried failure would leave me worse off than I started)
- Investing has been a new type of addiction (50K in alt coin and BTC up 50% over the last month, pulled out of all my positions yesterday)
- I’m still not really happy. All the excitement has worn off (it’s been almost 2 months)
- I got high for 2 weeks straight to cope with my depression of having nothing to work on (had a very unhealthy work life balance)
- Now that I’m between jobs my sense of purpose has diminished greatly, and all I want to do is start another company
Why am I telling you this?  I have no fucking idea.
- I’m trying to prioritize self care and invest more energy and time in family (but my wife can’t stand me being at home all day)
- Trying to avoid rushing into another thing that turns the next 5 years of my life into a blur (working on 4 active projects - but nothing is feeding the fire like the first company) 
In the end it’s about balance. It’s hard to not think that all of this is just bullshit. Struggling is part of life, and fighting some sort of adversarial force will always be part of it.  If you’re not starving to death in Africa swatting away mosquitoes all day, you’re alone in the west battling demons in your mind.
Read about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and be honest with yourself about your gaps.  Still trying to figure out my own shit (I think I’ve fulfilled 3.5/5 and am scratching at esteem &amp; self actualization) :
