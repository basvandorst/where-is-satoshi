Bitcoin just jumped $140 USD and no one is interested in expanding the transaction matrix of bitcoin??

BitSquare isn't complete, and there is issues with their method that don't particularly make them look "Original" in their push to deliver a new product to market. 
 When creating a p2p application you have to comply with the anti-money-laundering regulations, in order to bypass this you have to cap the payments you can send or receive per user. Or set a lifetime payment structure until the user verifies their information to conform with these laws. This makes it extremely hard to create a trading system where most prefer to be 'Anonymous'. However there is loopholes. 
 is to make a system where the user specifically only buys bitcoins and never transacts out of the bitcoin space through the application 100%. Thus building bitcoin into a form of value of trade that users have to trust and rely on vs using currencies with a possible one time option to cash out.
 we use a system that creates debit cards for it's users and again caps their limits, any heavy traders can find other means to deal with how they transact their bitcoins, as I do not expect someone trying to transfer $100,000 worth of bitcoin on our application anyways,  Anyone who does this I suggest would use a cold wallet anyways and have a specific goal or source to clear such a transaction in an exchange of value with another secret party.
Anyways the idea is that we build a team and push to lead the next generation of bitcoin p2p networks. Forget about what other services are doing. The only thing we are missing is the advanced coders, there is multiple ways we can go about verifying the transactions using sidechains, (seek into lightning network).. Or creating a completely cold wallet system that then back handles the transaction on our servers in the dark thus being able to pull the payment if it becomes fraudulent... This is a topic that would best be discussed later as it is a strong component to how the security of the system works. 
Now we have the name... which is already locked in, and it is rather fitting for this, and it is a 6 letter dot com! I will not mention it on this channel but I will give you a hint, it starts with the word "Pay".

Well I know that.. lol, I am referencing this to bitcoin, as p2p seems to have flaws due to the time it takes to process a transaction through the blockchain. Hence Crytocurrency as the next p2p app innovation.
