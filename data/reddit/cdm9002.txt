They were certainly savvy enough to work out how to send to a QR code from within the Coinbase mobile app, because that isn't intuitive at all.
See if you can provide better instructions. Also, sign up for a Coinbase merchant account. A user can then pay directly to you offchain, avoiding fees, and you will get the funds, even if they paid in BCH, LTC or ETH.

I can understand this. 
My business takes Bitcoin payments and I have had to deal with quite a few support issues when someone pays with Bitcoin. The experience is pretty bad at the moment, as payments take too long and fees are so variable that a high percentage fee on a $20 product just isn't worth it.
I have also seen a huge drop in the number Bitcoin payments, except for users paying that have a Coinbase account where the transaction is immediate and zero-fee because it happens off-chain.
Credit card payments and alt-coins are currently much more popular.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:46:44
There's quite a mixed bag because we support ShapeShift, but I'd say the most common recently are equally LTC, ETH and BCH 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:36:32
I run a business and take Bitcoin payments, but you need to be set up to do it and be aware of consequences.
First, if you have an accountant, speak to them. Tell them someone wants to pay you in property (that's how bitcoin is treated for taxes). If it's another business paying you in Bitcoin then it might be considered a barter transaction. 
1) When they pay you, you will either declare it as income to the fair market value in USD of the payment you received (e.g you billed them $1,000 but they are paying in Bitcoin, you have $1,000 income). Or, if they are just paying in Bitcoin with no USD value in mind, you need to use the [daily price]( x the amount you received.
When you come to sell the Bitcoin, you need to calculate the gain or loss and report that as capital gains income.
You could take it and immediately sell it and so not worry about gains (although you still have to report the transaction). However, you need to be set up with an account somewhere (e.g. Coinbase) that can do this for you. There could be a 1% fee. But, it can take a while to set up your account (it's like opening a bank account) then the price could fluctuate. Meaning you may have more or less than what you were paid. Be prepared to take that risk.
2) No one knows. A bit like being paid in stocks. Could go up, could go down. Are you prepared to lose it? If not, don't hold it.
3) Your call. Depends if you want risk-free guaranteed income or risky potentially increasing/decreasing income.
Personally, I take bitcoin payment but they are immediately converted to cash. I don't even see the Bitcoin, the payment processor (think credit card processor) does it all and gives me the USD value for which I sold the product, less their fee. It's risk free and I can budget.
If I want to invest, I will take some profits and buy Bitcoin. The advantage here is they are completely separate. I can track my business income and I can track my investments. There is no possible confusion that any long-term investments are coming from client payments.
My advice: get paid in cash/check/bank transfer this time. Look into it more, set up a merchant account with Coinbase and learn more about it. If you want to take Bitcoin payments in the future, set it up so you can have it converted to USD. If you want to invest in Bitcoin, do it separate from a client paying you.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:38:49
Depends it you intend keeping the Bitcoin/others or immediately convert to USD.
I use both a Coinbase merchant account and BitPay for Bitcoin. Both work well, however, the advantage with Coinbase is that if someone pays who is also a Coinbase customer the transaction can be done internally so the customer pays less fees.
Both solutions will let you convert to USD so you don't have to worry about capital gains taxes. You price your product in USD, Coinbase/BitPay work out the rate, manage taking the coins, convert them, and just deposit the USD amount in your account. Payouts can be set up automatic (or manual) to you bank.
You can also choose to keep some or all of it in crypto. Choice is yours, but if you do you still declare the whole amount of income in USD and then also have to track the cost basis of the coins for when they are traded or sold.
That is really just Bitcoin. For alt-coins we also use ShapeShift (Changelly is an alternative). I'm not interested in keeping those alts. So when the user pays, ShapeShift gives us a conversation rate to LTC or ETH (to avoid expensive BTC fees) and we work out the amount from our product price in USD to their chosen coin. The user send their coins to ShapeShift, who turn it into ETH or LTC, send it to our Coinbase account, who turn it into USD.
Accepting different currencies would be as you would normally do it, through multi-currency merchant accounts.
It you convert to USD then there are no taxes to worry about (obviously income tax when you report your net income).
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:58:21
No, because it's now 2014.
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:15:04
Right. It doesn't have to be. If you literally had physical coins for each Bitcoin you owned, bought at a different prices, you could choose which to sell.
This is "specific identification". You can do it for stocks in advance of selling (although the IRS doesn't want you to change each year for your own advantage). However, bitcoin aren't stocks, but mostly considered right now are general capital assets.
The website works this out and you can views the methods, FIFO, average or specific identification.

Your comment on wash sales is contrary to [bitcoinaccountant]( who had posted some information on reddit, as well as by [Greg Broiles]( in a video from last year.
I'm not saying you're wrong, I have no idea given that the IRS hasn't said, but what makes you say they don't apply? If the IRS later decides they do, would it be backdated?
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:22:06
For large amounts you could claim a casualty loss if it meets the criteria, but it would only ever be for the cost basis of the coins originally.
I believe you could also claim them as capital losses with a price of zero, again it is effectively only the cost basis, and offset against gains as well as income up to the $3k/yr maximum. (US only).
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:34:02
To hep you find the answer, In Q4, his opinion is that any trading for goods or services where you made a gain is taxable, and therefore your trade in altcoins was a tax event. So you need to calculate the cost basis of the coins, calculate the gains and include it your tax return.
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:13:25
If you bought 2 shares in GOOG, they both keep their own cost basis. Treatment of Bitcoin is really no different.
You could tell them apart if you put them in different addresses.
OP has an opinion on use of specific identification (e.g. LIFO) or averaging, and believes it could not be used, but the IRS has not clarified.

Do you do a card with the address and BIP38 key which isn't under a hologram, perhaps just one to make it look nice.
I'm paranoid about scratching off the key when trying to remove the hologram, and I always like to test the address/key with a small amount before I commit a large sum. But then removing the hologram defeats the purpose. So I guess I just want a nice looking encrypted card.

I am planning on adding a Purchases page, where you can add those things, e.g. bought a $100 card with bitcoins. Like cross-coin trading, the bitcoins you use are "sold" into fiat (and so their gains calculated) then you would you that amount to buy the gift card.
Right now you could just add it as a manual Sell trade.
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:03:34
With LIFO, is it just not advisable or absolutely not allowed? Why not advisable?
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:05:04
The advice right now is to treat it as a capital asset. In which case, every time you sell you need to subtract the cost of those coins and any fees. That is your capital gain, and taxable.
Unfortunately it's not always so straightforward, because you don'y buy and sell in equal amounts or round numbers.
I created [bitcointaxes.info]( that works it out for you, especially if you lots of trades from different exchanges. It also works out gains on any alt-coin trades.

I've added Cryptsy to the todo list.
For lost coins, my understanding that would be a casualty or theft loss. I'll look at adding something in for this, but only to calculate the figure as you would have to report it appropriately on your forms. Be aware your loss would be of the cost basis, not the FMV, and is reduced by $100 per event and 10% AGI in total.
I was looking add adding a page for Purchases / Sales / Gifts, but you could manually include a gift now by entering a "sale" with with the same cost basis (i.e. a zero gain), as the cost basis is transferred with the gift.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:50:45
Correct, you aren't taxed for merely owning bitcoins. Only on the gains if you turn it back into USD (or other currency), even if it remains in the exchange, or if you spent any.

You should be very cautious if you are sending your phone away and there is any chance of someone accessing your confidential information. This definitely includes your email and any 2FA codes, especially if the app you has hints at your account details.
Personally, I'd completed wipe a phone before I send it in.
Now before you rush off and do that, when you do, you'll lose your 2FA keys. So first you should remove the current 2FAs from all the services that currently use it, but add a new one in its place.
Since you won't have a phone, you can use a computer other than the one you normally use to access these services. There are some desktop authenticator apps, such as [WinAuth]( or Chrome extensions. Make sure you take backups (on paper ideally) of the secret keys for your authenticators. Once you have added your new authenticators and checked you can access your accounts, you can remove the old ones from your phone. When you have backuped or secured all your phone data, you can finally wipe it before sending it off.

The "letter" to the entrepreneur is really just hearsay as it is not included in the [coindesk]( article, I assume to which you are referring.
In any case, you are assuming it means transferring bitcoins in the context of an exchange. But it could mean purchasing good or services and merely paying with Bitcoin. In which case, applying GST is quite understandable and reasonable.

Profit just means your business income less expenses. Mining equipment might well be a business expense, although how much you can allocate may vary depending on when you purchased or started using it.
The other issue is how to treat the income.
If you mine a coin, did you create income or did you manufacture stock?
For the first, say you mined a coin which happened to be worth £10 that day, then you can say that you received £10 income.  Tomorrow, if the price of a coin is £15, then you have also made a capital gain of £5.
In the second scenario, you manufactured a coin. It has no income until it is realised into a currency (or used like one). So say you "sell" it tomorrow, then you receive £15 income.
However, even in the first scenario it could be argued by HMRC that the £15 is all income and not gains.
So there are multiple ways mining could be treated and it is on them to say how it is treated, because taxes on personal income, business income and gains are all different.
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:47:42
Definitely, but I know almost nothing about your tax system.
Really the only US specifics are:
1) The way the gains on the trades can be calculated, in that the default is a first-in-first-out basis but you can choose to identify the coins you sell, as long as you are consistent. So my question is does Australia have any particular rules around that?
2) Long-term is defined as holding the asset for over 1yr, and short term is a year or less. Some countries don't even differentiate.
3) Ordinary income tax bands are used to give the Capital Gains tax rate. And there is no standard exemption. This is really for information only though, as it has no bearing on the Sales page.
This is all more of UI changes than anything, but if anyone can answer these questions it would at least let me work on it.

So MtGox gets refunded but no one else.

This is a know issue, unfortunately, and has been seen before but there is no process to handle it.
Sometimes Bitpay gets behind and the 15 minutes expire before they have picked up the transaction on the network. I have seen this in development and testing with Bitpay integration.
What's worse, when the transaction doesn't get picked up by Bitpay (I have seen 4 hrs) it is still not passed into the vendor's account and just sits in limbo.
You have to log a support ticket with Bitpay, giving them the transaction number and tell them to pass it onto the vendor's account, or refund it to you.
Bitpay needs to acknowledge this issue and put in a way to handle it.

However, if an employee wanted to be paid in BTC I might agree with them that we would still pay them in £ but the actually pay transfer would be done in BTC for their net amount.

In your comment above, your said you could separate wallets. I assume what you mean is trying to hold those coins physically separately, much like holding stocks of the same company but with different brokers.
But in reality, when you move a coin from one of those wallets into an exchange to sell (as you would have to do to realize it), it gets mixed - possibly with some of your other coins. You can no longer keep them physically separate, only the record of cost basis. So then, doesn't that mean you are doing exactly the same and if the IRS doesn't allow specific identification and you got audited they would look and not allow it.
In reality, it wouldn't be possible to not mix them when you come to sell, without having two separate accounts on an exchange (are you able to have multiple accounts per identity?).
So is this even a solution?
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:17:27
You can only use the cost basis.

Yes, in order to crack it.
So you could assume that he has only used lower case, upper case and numbers. There are 62 possible characters, in 4 places. So 62x62x62x62 = 14.7M = 24 days (@ 7 tries/s)
If you think he has a special character in there, then we need to up it to 95. So 95x95x95x95 = 135 days.
If you think there is a Unicode character in there, then worst case you are going to have 1,112,064 x 1,112,064 x 1,112,064 x 1,112,064. 7 Quadrillion years.
I'll be honest, I think puzzles like this are just dumb. Either your key is strong enough not to be cracked or it is weak and crackable. Generally they aren't worth your time as the pot is usually less than the resources required to find it.
If he used a very weak password, e.g. only lower case letters, then someone might find it. But otherwise the only thing that is going to happen is OP will grab his coins back at some point.

If I sell you a widget, I add % sales tax to the price and that goes to the government. No need for draconian registering address and machines. Besides the point of bitcoin is to use different addresses for each transaction.
Are you proposing treating crypto as currency or commodity or something entirely new? One of the problems is we have a new payment paradigm but people are still trying to work out how to handle it the old way.
As the story goes, if Ford had asked his customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse. The mindset has to change.
You can't put cryptos in the same box as cash or stocks. It is both and neither.
Tax when bitcoins is used to purchase, and make it a responsibility of the vendor to charge and collect. Tax when gains are made, make it a responsibility of the exchange to calculate and collect.

This is not how it works in the US. If you exchange capital assets, you need to account for any gains. However, since the IRS has given no guidance this would only apply if you intend to file as an asset rather than a currency. There is no argument that this is crazy and should change.
Given the latest HMRC ruling, aren't they saying it should treated as a currency? In that case wouldn't it be taxed as income when mined, at the fair value? As you are just creating a value of currency.
I can understand your point, and so I'm genuinely interested in your reasoning, because to me it is still ambiguous.

If a group can decide to alter the ledger for their own gains, what is to stop it happening in the future. This would be a terrible precedent and cause a huge lack of confidence.

In the UK, there are Distance Selling Regulations, meaning whenever a consumer buys anything remotely (internet, phone, by mail) they have 7 days in which to cancel or return the item and receive a full refund.
There are some exceptions, customisations, perishables, immediate services, etc.
But even if you paid in BTC, you are legally entitled to your money back.
A chargeback is just a method of returning funds, but is not the actual dispute mechanism. Disputes should be done directly with the vendor, and a chargeback is a last resort. Most chargebacks aren't even allowed for 30 days or until you have tried to resolve it yourself.
However, knowing you can do a chargeback gives the consumer more confidence in purchasing from an unknown company.
I don't see why a Bitcoin payment processor couldn't offer consumer protection in the same way. In the end it's just a process and not a feature of the payment itself. It would remove the whole consumer hesitation of sending BTC to a new company and not knowing what will happen if it goes wrong.

Or, convert to EUR and buy at Kraken. Prices are 461-466  EUR to get the volume, so say 463 EUR.  Convert £34k is 42,784 EUR. So about 92.39 BTC (less their fee). At Coinbase that is $57,003.50
Compare this to Transferwise. Right now that would be $57,880.19 and takes 3 days.
I also have used xe.com, and a quote is $57,316.25.
The best way is to call up your bank and have them do a wire transfer. My bank has a £4.50 fee and a very reasonable rate. I can't get a quote now, but in my experience it is slightly better than Transferwise. 3 working days too.

I'm not an accountant, but I think you're wrong. This [tax attorney's]( comment is that Bitcoin is a general asset and therefore gains and losses are filed like any other asset within Schedule D.
In that case, it is capital gains and losses not currency. You will pay taxes on any gains, and can offset losses against gains and short-term losses against ordinary income up to $3k/yr. It being an unregulated market is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:28:36
I don't think anyone assumes BTCs are taxed if you never convert back to dollars (or equivalent). I don't.
But they would if you trade at all, e.g. sell and buy back, even if you never received the money into your personal back account. That's a tax event.
Likewise if you traded BTC for LTC or some other coin, or even spent some BTC. Right now (unless the IRS clarifies) it's being seen as a tax event because you are buying something using a gain you may have made.

The IRS has no official position on this.
1) you mine 1 BTC on 01/01/2013 and so have $13.31 of income.  You sell it on 26/11/2013 for $1,000 and have capital gains.
2) you mine 1 BTC on 01/01/2013 and sell it on 26/11/2013 and have $1,000 income. If you don't sell it, it's stock, and you have no income until you do.

Thanks for the repost. A message popped into my inbox, so I though I'd do a quick update.
Lots changed since Jan, with the site and the IRS obviously. The IRS guidance on basically *everything is taxable right now!* is pretty much how we were treating it. Seemed better to be prudent.
Actually today I managed to push out the latest version, which now supports Canada, Australia and Germany. To be fair Germany is much like the US except long term tax estimations use a zero rate. Whereas Canada defaults to average costing, and Australia has a different tax year.
Support for UK will be added after April when their tax year ends.
Regarding the US and IRS. We still treat coin-coin trading as a tax event. The IRS notice wasn't explicit in saying this was or wasn't the way, but they did say the any disposition of property was a tax event. So that with Tyson Cross's comment that alt-coins probably aren't like-kind means we are keeping it that way for now.
The next phase of development is underway and mainly this is going to include:
* a view of the current tax year
* a way to add purchases and so include them in your gains
* a way to add mining income, to calculate income as well as include those coins in future gains
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:20:27
I don't know about Canadian tax laws, but you might still be able to use  to calculate your capital gains.
You can import all your trades from different exchanges, and it'll work out the gains.

@_date: 2014-02-25 18:55:52
As far as I know, yes. They can only be used to reduce any gains in future years down to the standard allowance of £10,600.
Could Bitcoin losses be allowed to be deducted against income? Not sure. Only if they could be considered as negligible value.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:28:31
Some [tax specialists]( believe you do, as they don't qualify as "like kind" exchanges and therefore are a tax event. So you would therefore have to calculate the equivalent gain in USD.

btcrobinhood is running a scan of brainwallets and found coins in those wallets. He transferred them out.
He will argue that he is doing it so when the rightful owner comes along he would return then with a life lesson to "not use brainwallets". And if btcrobinhood didn't do it, someone else would eventually.
However, btcrobinhood really should include messages in the transactions explaining this, because all the owner sees is that their coins are gone. And how much has he swiped that has not been returned?
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:13:14


Whilst this should be the case, in reality it isn't.
I've developed sites that use Bitpay and during testing have seen sometimes they just don't see the transactions on the network quickly enough. The longest took 4 hours. This is for 0 confirmations. So if you are paying for anything instantly, buyer beware, Bitcoin is still in its infancy and needs more work.

I guess he's been asleep for 6 months. The bulk of this happened in March-April. Anyone who reported gains ought to have paid 90% of those taxes before April 15 and so any selling has already happened.
There was a down trend from middle March to middle April that could have included this, amongst the China news.
Yes, the gains made in 2013 (this isn't the "first year BTC income or gains has actually been reportable", just the largest) were significant, and a large tax revenue, but beware the losses that are going to be claimed this year with people selling/buying back.

I didn't check his figures at the time, but the difference is he isn't selling them all so still has coins with a low cost basis. In your example, if you had sold only 1 at $1,000, your gain is either zero if you sold the one you just bought, or $990 if you sold one of the other 10 you owned.
@_date: 2014-01-13 05:36:34
This is deliberate to only deal with 2013. Trades in 2012 are irrelevant for your 2013 return, but you do need to put in your opening positions for what you owned and their cost basis.
If it can't match a Sell with a Buy, which would happen in this case, then it has to assume a zero-cost basis. There is an error displayed (which needs to be made more visible) if you page through the last table.
Right now you need to add the opening positions.
The other way is that it allows you to deal with your taxes like it was 2012 to give you your opening position for 2013. I may look at this.

This is the problem with the current situation, in that it is still a tax event, and you have converted your coins into dollars, or equivalent. So you are supposed to work out any gains that you might have in the coins at the point where you spent them, and include that in your capital gains at the end of the year.
It is just impractical if you start using bit coins a lot. And why the IRS needs to treat it differently.

Till then, most advice I see suggests treating it as a general asset, in which case gains are realised when they are turned into fiat or essentially used like fiat.
If you are going to pay taxes, you can only do so in good faith, and in this case decide on your approach.

I think the IRS sitting on their hands is not helping. This year has seen an explosion in use and a number of investors and traders are asking what do I do?
It is understandable they have to think it though and issue guidance, but in the meantime, especially, given the time of year, it would be extremely useful if they gave some intermediary advice. This could be at least. treat it as capital assets until we finalise. At least people would not have to be making guesses about should I/shouldn't I, capital gains/currency.
At [bitcointaxes.info]( we took a good faith and reasonable position and treat it as a capital asset.
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:56:11
All you could get from the blockchain is a daily average. You can't tell how much you paid for a coin, how much you sold it for or any trade fees you incurred.
Every time you spend a coin (in QT client anway) the change comes back to another address, so could have a lot of addresses to consolidate. And you can't tell if you just moved it between addresses or you actually sold any.
The only real reportable way this would work is to use the exchange's trade data.
@_date: 2014-04-27 05:43:30
As you saw, handling purchases is something that is being worked on, by tracking addresses and their transactions.
Integration with wallets will probably be done in partnership with the developers, as I wouldn't expect you to have to import anything from your wallet. However, if you could export from your wallet your spending transactions (and the fair value price of your purchase) then we could import that and use it in our tax calculations.
Our default method is the IRS's default of FIFO, however, the premium version does also calculate average costing and specific identification, which includes LIFO, HCFO, LCFO, and so on.
Hope that helps.

edit: March 2014 - this post has been re-posted to so I am including the latest update here too.
Much has changed since Jan, and we were out of Beta in Feb and have had lots of users and great feedback. Generally very positive.
More exchanges were added, and we're trying to add more with each release, as well as adding support for other countries by their specific capital gains treatments and necessary countries.
Actually today I managed to push out the latest version, which now supports Canada, Australia and Germany. To be fair Germany is much like the US except long term tax estimations use a zero rate. Whereas Canada defaults to average costing, and Australia has a different tax year.
Support for UK will be added after April when their tax year ends.

* a view of the current tax year
* a way to add purchases and so include them in your gains
* a way to add mining income, to calculate income as well as include those coins in future gains
~~It's in beta right now as there are a few things to do. I'm hoping it'll be useful for anyone who has traded Bitcoins, Litecoins and others across different exchanges last year. It certainly is for me, and the reason I developed it.~~
~~You export your trades and upload them into the website. It currently supports:~~
~~* Mt.Gox
* Bitstamp
* Coinbase
* BTC-e
* LocalBitcoins
* And a general CSV capability~~
~~Others can be included if enough interest.~~
~~You can add any opening positions from previous years, along with your trade data, and it will calculate your gains using FIFO, as well as specific identification using a set of strategies.~~
~~Once you view and choose your results, you can see the Capital Assets Sales for inclusion in a Schedule D and 8949.~~
~~It also will show closing positions, with your balance and costs basis for next year.~~
~~It is initially US centric, although the capital gains calculations are general so can be used by anyone. However, I plan to add UK rules in the near future. Plus any others countries depending on access to appropriate accounting knowledge.~~
~~You can upload cross-currency trades, e.g. BTC-LTC, which are calculated through fiat for tax purposes. You can't do LTC-*Others* right now until I've added some average exchange rates.~~
~~Please take a look and see how it works for your situation. If there are any bugs or issues, please let me know here or send a bug report through the site.~~
~~Multiple coin trades will be supported, but only through BTC or LTC. Right now LTC-&gt;COIN isn't working.~~
~~There is support for different specific identification methods (lifo, hcfo, lcfo, etc) and averaging. Averaging is broke and being fixed. The others are hidden for now, partly to get some feedback on the general site, and also because there will be a free and paid versions (somewhere around $10) for the more complicated things, like multiple currencies, multiple coins, multiple methods and exporting into tax software.~~

Really appreciate the response, thanks.
The instances I had seen were low amounts but still had a fee. I can't tell you where the delay was, except the transaction was listed in blockchain.info, and I eventually got the "late payment" email.
Fortunately it was just me testing, but had it been a real customer I'm not sure they would have known what to do, and this is the issue. I know you guys resolve it when you are told, but the customer would come to me. I'd look and see no payment, and have to tell them to log a support ticket with you. Just a lacking nice customer experience and they are left not confident where there money went.
I do hope the protocol improvements can improve the customer experience in these fringe cases.

Each sale is a tax event, so she owes any gains from the $10,000 sale, being the difference in price of each coin she sold and the price they were bought for.
Now she buys another $5,000 worth of coins.  This is not taxable until they are sold. However (and lets say they were 5 at $1000 each) the cost basis for each coin is $1,000, which will be used to calculate the gains when they are sold.
tldr; she owes 25% (her ordinary income rate) of the profit made from the $10,000.

Obviously this is a unique case, but lets say they do file bankruptcy and try and pay everyone back.
From the leaked document, if they have the customer accounts fiat money, just lacking the BTC. So do you think they would pay back all the fiat and then try and reimbuse the BTC holders?
In that case would they do something just divide any remaining monies to pay off the Bitcoin equally, say they could reimburse $1 per BTC (numbers made up, just an example)? Or do they not have to do anything?

When you renounce US citizenship you have to pay capital gains on your assets as if they had been sold.
If you just planned becoming a dual-citizen of another country, no point, the US has worldwide income tax so you would still own capital gains.

* 5, has plugins
* 6. no USD conversion
I really don't want those, except 2 and 5.
1. Sure, I'd like it to be free. But that just isn't realistic. How is a company supposed to build a supportable, scalable payment solution that's free? Fees need to be cheaper than plastic and competitive. I need to know the payment processor is going to be around in the future, able to provide support and future development.
2. I don't like BitPay's model of adding an additional network fee. It just makes me think their systems are inefficient. If they want to include fees, charge the merchant, and then that will make them compete with other players.
3. I don't want to have to manage my own wallet. I don't want to have to worry about losing my keys or being hacked. That's what the merchant service is for, to take all that away from me and let me concentrate on what I do.
4. There needs to be customer history, details of payment, reports. I need this information. I need to be able to reconcile data. I need to be able to charge sales tax and report income correctly.
5. Absolutely.
6. I definitely do not want to keep my payments in crypto. I want them immediate converted to USD. Ideally I wouldn't even see the crypto, but I do have to keep some in order to process refunds. I also want to minimize the reporting of my capital gains, so having it converted to USD means I just don't have to worry about it.
Your requirements really seem to be from the perspective of a consumer, not the merchant. They want all these things, and if done well, most of it is transparent. But as a business, needs are different.

I received this email this morning. It's a good fake.
I called PayPal and they confirmed no emails had been send to me today. They also said they do not send from "paypal
I questioned how they got my email address, which is unique for paypal. No real answer there. My full name was in the email body, but it could have been extract from my email address.
What's odd is in Gmail it shows as signed with the paypal.com domain. Doesn't look like is a one (1) or capital i (I) through.
It was good enough for me to call paypal and see what was going on. There is no link in the email though, so curious as to what the point was.

Dropping $10k into an account once, or multiple times, will raise a flag. The banks will follow their KYC procedures.
It might be possible your bank requests more information to understand where this extra income came from. You are under no obligation to tell them, but they could also decide not to keep you as a customer.
The only other time you might have to explain this, is if you are audited for your tax return in that year. The IRS may well query where this income came from.

They can't prove what you tell them one way or the other, and honestly can't imagine they wouldn't even try. They just have to ask to ensure you are not money laundering or doing anything illegal. You'll know if they think you are, because they'll drop you as a customer.

This is hardly unique to PayPal. In fact, if you haven't been charged fees for chargebacks, you've been lucky so far.
I have an online service and use Stripe. They have the same procedure. If a user signs up and pays for my online service, uses it, and then decides to file a chargeback, there's nothing I can do. No matter what proof I send (account details, server logs, IP address) it was always be rejected. It is the customer's own bank who makes the decision and they are hardly going to side with me. A chargeback is the original amount + $15.
The only solution would be to send a registered mail item to their postal address as part of signing up. Then you have shipped something physical and can prove it. Fortunately, the occurrences have been low so I haven't had to resort to this yet.
Otherwise I do as much up-front checking as possible. I won't accept any card that fails CVV, post code or address matches. I also check the IP address with their billing address. If there is anything suspicious, I'll contact them by email and ask them a question. If I get no response, I'll more than likely just suspend their account and refund the amount.
I would suggest thinking about moving away from PayPal and use a platform that provides more fraud detection, so at least you can protect yourself a little more.

Apps integrated with Coinbase's OAUTH can request a set of permissions, like, viewing trade history, viewing transfer history, and send money.
The flow is that you use an external app
* click the "I want to add Coinbase to this app"
* Coinbase website appears and you login (if not already)
* it shows you the name of the app and permission they are requesting
* you click Authorize
* they can do what they like with those permissions
Very similar to authorizing a facebook or twitter app.

Have you tried just turning off the fee in Settings-&gt;Options, in the Main tab set the fee to 0.
I don't use the client for real BTCs, so maybe there is a minimum fee limit is set. If that's the case you can just copy the address/key with your coins into another wallet.
Your coins are attached to your address, which itself has a private key that you must have in order to send coins from that address. You can get your private key from the client by going to Help-&gt;Debug Window, Console tab, type "dumpprivkey &lt;address&gt;" where the &lt;address&gt; is you bitcoin address copied from the main Receive Coins page.
With this private key you can go to bitaddress.org and print a paper wallet. Or you could go to blockchain.info and import your private key and effectively "move" you coins to their online wallet .

I tried to follow their instructions, but they seem out of date.
1. Open an incognito/private browser window and login to your account as normal
2. Go to the Receive Money tab and then to the Import/Export tab to make sure the scripts are all loaded (else you'll get an error later)
3. Disconnect internet (disable adapter or pull ethernet plug)
4. Go to Receive Money tab and click New Address. Ignore warning.
5. Go to Import/Export, accept warning, and click Paper Wallet. Print or Save. For your new address, top number is the address and bottom number is the private key. Keep that very safe. (You can also do Export Unencrypted to get the address and blockchain's private key format.)
6. Logout (top right icon).
7. Reconnect internet.
8. Log back in. Your new address will be gone because it wasn't saved into your wallet. That's fine.
9. If you want to see the funds as part of your account, go to Import/Export, Import, and paste your new address (not the private key) into the "Add Watch Only Bitcoin Address". Continue.
10. Go to Receive tab and you should see it there. 
11. You can send money to this address (or transfer between your addresses) and it will be part of your wallet's balance, but it cannot be withdrawn.
To send from this address:
1. Log into your account as above.
2. Go to Send Money, choose Custom on the left
3. Choose Watch address as From, enter To address and amount. Set fee as appropriate. Click Review Payment.
4. Paste the private key and Confirm transaction

coastermonger means that when you execute the withdrawal they display the transactionid, which can be then viewed in the blockchain. If you had noted it down you could check the state of the transaction, but unfortunately it isn't displayed anywhere else after that one-time display.
I find withdrawals are normally pretty quick (10-20 mins for 1st confirmation), so if you are sure you added a fee you could contact their support and get the transactionid.

I have no experience of bitstant myself, so it's anecdotal in that I see a lot of people complaining. I have used MtGox, coinbase and bitfloor and everything was fine.

I think this is great.
It would be good to have a sign up phase, with email confirmation and 2-factor authenticator, i.e. Google's. At least you are trying to validate they are who they say they are. Log everything about their account.
The biggest issue is a chargebacks is that the issuing bank will side with their customer, unless you can prove delivery. In the physical world, this would be a tracking number and delivery confirmation. In the digital world, you can't, and you will be screwed.
Best solution is to add a little extra in fees, and send them a physical piece of paper including details the bitcoin transaction, with tracking. That way you can almost prove they got something. It won't stop them all, but will give you evidence against most.
edit: if you start getting chargebacks, you might have to consider sending the bitcoins out as a paper barcode in a unique address. At least you can then track it through the mail and you can see when if it was transferred. You'll keep a copy of the private key, so if you get a dispute and the coin is still there, you can pull it back, otherwise it is proof that it was taken.

~~And that's why people should stop unless they are writing a GPU based attack.~~
~~Assuming you're talking about 1m+ rounds, giving a standard English dictionary with 31k words 5 chars or less.  A reasonable CPU based hasher processing, say 30k hashes/s, you're looking at 12 days processing.~~
I agree with your original premise of using rounds for a brain wallet to thwart rainbow tables, but really even rounds as small as 1000 would drastically increase the search space. Adding salts into those original hashes would make it near impossible. Well-known PBKDF2 implementations use 40,000-100,000 iterations along with their salt. This would be a better approach to brain wallets.

Yes, when you convert back to dollars. Your gain (or loss) being the difference between purchasing them and selling them. That is taxable as capital gains. If you don't convert them back you don't pay/report anything until you do.
AFAIK sales tax depends on your state. Here, WA, for instance there is a sales / use tax. If I buy something online and didn't pay any taxes, I am supposed to include and pay the equivalent sales tax in my taxes at the end of the year.
I don't know the official way to calculate the amount for  BTC purchase, but imagine it would be based on either the BTC/USD on that day or the average for the year.

I started answer all your questions, but stopped as it seems are thinking of charging a BTC only price and handling all the exchanging yourself. That is asking for trouble imho if you have a USD cost based product.
Use someone like bitpay who guarentee the exchange rate and amount in USD you will receive. It takes away all the issues but allows you to "accept" bitcoins.
The only issue might be refund, but then that's down to your policy. You could refund in USD, or send the equivalent BTC back to them.

It may well be possible to brute force a known pattern, and there are scripts to do this where the number of combinations are limited. But brute forcing generally is impractical due to key strengthening, which deliberately slows down each attempt.
Your best bet is by human brute force. Go to bed, get a good night's sleep, get up and sit in front of your computer with a  piece of paper and pencil. Try all the passwords you can think of. After each one, write it down so you don't try it again. When you're done, have a break, come back and try and remember more.

Valid question, why the downvotes?
I have a hard time seeing the viability of this. Why would anyone turn $ into BTC to buy a product back in $? You get hit twice with fees (albeit small) and will be buying it at a higher price than $. Maybe only the "I bought something in BTC!!" crowd.
You lose your credit card protection as you didn't buy the product. You also have to trust a third party to handle potential refunds or returns not to mention handing over your BTCs on a promise in the first place.
And who is dumping their BTC for $ right now anyway? Maybe if you had a stack burning a hole in your wallet and already made a profit, but that doesn't seem like the majority nor a long term strategy. Careful you aren't then tax-evading.
Anonymity? If anyone is that bothered in being truly anonymous, let's face it, they wouldn't being making purchases from Amazon, and they wouldn't being included their real shipping address.
I genuinely hope the use of BTC succeeds and I'm just wrong here, but right now I can't see how the model works for consumers. It would be like me calling my friend in Europe and asking them to buy something on Amazon.com for me in EUR and I'll pay them back converting my USD to EUR. Costly and pointless.

Anyway, no, as they aren't based in the US so you are responsible for reporting it.
If you had gain (or losses) you would them on your Schedule D and 8949 and tick C on part 1, if you had the coins for a year or less, otherwise part 2.

They were out of coins at the time. When they are out of coins they give you the option to continue to buy but at the price when the coins arrive, although you can cancel any time before then.

For barter transactions, you'll have to use the fair price. Since there is no official daily rate, you wouldn't be wrong in choosing one exchange, as long as you are consistent.


Cost basis is zero, but equipment might be a business expense. A mined coin is income, potentially hobby income if it is a small amount (and passes other IRS tests), or self-employed/business income. The difficultly is how the gains are classified.
For instance, say I mined 1 BTC worth $10 (at the time). Today that coin is worth $600. The IRS will probably argue that my income is $600, as opposed to $10 with $590 gains.
To make your case for using gains (and lower tax rate) you would need to show a separation between income and gains, and the best way would be to sell the coin when mined, then buy it back.

Had you coins 1 year or less?
You'll declare it as short-term capital gains on your Schedule D and 8949. It will be added to your income figure and taxed accordingly.
Had your coins for more than a year?
You can declare it as long-term capital gains and it will be taxed at 15% if your income tax rate is 25% or higher and at 0% if your income tax bracket is 15% or less. Those are federal rates, states vary, and California is up to an additional 13.3%.
Traded any on the exchange before cashing out?
You need to figure in those profits (or losses) and include them. Although there is no specified guidance from the IRS on bitcoins, the default is first-in-first-out, but you may be able to use specific identification, which might be beneficial if you are not selling them all as you can sell ones that minimise your gain.
You can deduct any fees for the USD transfer and trading fees from the gain value.
It would be worthwhile seeing an accountant if you have a large amount.

Sorry for your losses.
Current brain wallets with any common passwords or even using four common words are quite hackable.
There are only 11m addresses (as of a few days ago) in use right now...ones that have received coins, so it is trivial to write something to scan for matches in hashes from brainwallets. To start simply, you can use 4 of the top 500 English words between 6 and 8 letters. It can be completed within a few days. Even my desktop can do 2.5k EC calculations/s.
They just aren't a good idea and certainly not as safe as you think they are. The main issue is the pathetically simple brain wallet-to-key algorithm used on these websites. It is no more than a hash. It is comparable to using simple MD5 to hash passwords with no salt or key strengthening.
By using a brain wallet with common words, you are effectively reducing the complexity of your key down to the level of 8-9 character password (mixed case letters and digits), which is easily crackable.
Anyone who is using something like this, needs to move their coins and drop that address.

I think bitcent (bit cent like euro cent) definitely would be more appealing, but it does have the downside that it is currently equivalent to 1 USD, and people think of a "cent" as worthless, which it wouldn't be.
Verbally, "bitcoin", "bitcent". Presumably going down to "bitmilli" or "millibit", "microbit" and "satoshi".

You'll file taxes as self-employed/business so, yes, your costs can be deducted, but only in the year you literally start mining. You make sure to turn enough into cash for that reason.
Another point, to avoid any ambiguity of the coins being long-term CG and not SE income, you should sell them when you mine and then buy them back. That way you have a record that you purchased coins for long term gains and they will be taxed lower if they are worth a lot in years to come.

Right. Not impossible but essentially impossible.
There are 2^160 addresses, and there are 2^256 private keys, But because addressees are hashes, each one can match 2^96 private keys.
So in your question, there is a 1 in 2^256 chance you will generate the same private key. But a larger chance that you will generate the same address.

I'm not saying you shouldn't use bitcoins, but for someone in the same country it seems inefficient with fees and time if you are just trying to send the average person some cash.
The local exchanges are fine, if you don't mind putting the burden on the recipient. They have to go out and meet some for a cash transaction. Slightly inconvenient, like being sent a check (before online deposits).
Just my opinion. Good for technical and early adopters, not do much yet for typical Joe.

Yes, capital gains is liable on every trade and every gain/loss. You should calculate your cost for each trade and work out the gain/loss minus any fee.
If you are in the US, and you held the coins for 1 year or less, it will be taxed as income, and on your Schedule D it will be classed as short-term gains. The tax rate will therefore be your current income tax rate.
If you had the coins for more than a year, then it will apply the CG rate, which is either 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your income.
For the UK, there is relief on the first £10,600, afterwards CG is taxed at 18% or 28% depending on income.
If you have a lot of gain, probably worth seeing an accountant.

You can still request a chargeback on a debit card even after using a PIN, however, it is less unlikely to go through as in most cases you probably broke the card agreement by sharing the PIN. However, it is feasible that someone stole a card after watching you enter a PIN and then used it fraudulently. It would be down to an individual bank's policy. 
Online PINs are used, such as the Mastercard Securecode and "Verified by VISA" but they aren't popular in the US. Moreso in Europe where chip-and-pin is more widely used.
Nonetheless, after a chargeback, it is on the vendor to prove that the transaction was valid and goods were received. Whilst possible, many vendors might still not be willing to take such a small risk, unless they are covered by an absolute liability shift.
tl:dr; possibly in Europe with chip-and-pin, [less likely in US](

Personally, I don't think about tracking coins per the blockchain, so how they are in wallets is irrelevant from a tax point of view.
What matters is when you turn to/from fiat. So as long as you can say I bought 1 BTC here for X and sold 1 BTC then for Y you should have a good history.
What makes it complicated is you rarely buy and sell in the same numbers, and each buy/sell itself might be split up into multiple trades of different quantities and price.
So what I do for myself is bring all that data together, and rewrite my complete trade history (splitting trades if necessary) to be able to match a sell against an equivalent buy quantity. Which one depends on 
the allocation method.
Of course, you end up with pages of trade history, but you'll be able to show each sell, amount, original cost and gain/loss. You also see your year's ending cost position based on what's left.
I initially tried doing this is a speadsheet, but it's just way too complicated and prone to error, hence the software.
edit: on your point about the localbitcoins, if they have an export you could use that, if not you would just have to keep a record of what you bought when, i.e.
date/time, quantity, price per coin, fee
That's enough information to keep a record.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:23:12
You don't normally see the private key in blockchains website, what you see is the address. There is a key, which you can get to by exporting. You wouldn't want to delete it unless you aren't planning on using that address any more.
An address has a built in checksum, like a  credit card number, so you can't just make one up. Even if you did get the checksum right, you wouldn't have the private key, do the address would be pointless. An address is actually created the other way around, a random private key is generated and then a public key is calculated. The address is a human readable version of the hash of that public key.

Alternatively, you can create a new address/private key pair offline. Print off the private key and put it somewhere safe. All you then have on your computer is the address the key is tied to. You can then send yours coins to that address. If you ever need to spend, you type (or scan the QR code) your private key.  is good for this.
My main downer on using bitcoin-qt is that it creates 100+ addresses in the background. When you then spend, the change gets sent to one of those other addresses. After several transactions your coins get to be spread around the addresses within your wallet. This is fine is you are going to completely copy and replace your wallet.dat file, but just don't think that the main address you see has all the coins.

And the reason for this (more info for OP) is that to challenge a chargeback the vendor needs to provide proof of delivery.

I've written this under someone's comment, but it needs to be more visible.
When you initially add the authenticator in MtGox, it shows a Standard Private Key and Secure Private Key. These are the one-time keys that are used as the seeds to generate your codes. Copy these down in case you ever lose your phone.
If you've already added your authenticator and didn't do this. Go and remove it and and a new one.
Make sure to put them somewhere safe and secure. They are as important as your normal password, so treat it as secure as how you store any complicated password.
If you need to recover from a lost phone, you can use the Google Authenticator and add a new account, and do "enter key provided" using the Secure Private Key from above. That will regenerate your same authenticator.

Be aware, you will need to be verified to withdraw coins or cash out of MtGox, so don't blindly make an account and send your BTC over there.
This is the same with Bitstamp.
Time to get verified varies, 1-2 weeks.
Move your coins to your personal wallet and then start getting verified at an exchange if you think you want to trade.
Moving coins back out of an exchange is usually pretty quick (&lt; 1hr) but cash takes a lot longer (e.g. MtGox -&gt; USD is 2-3 months).

I had used [blockchain,info]( but I know they just recently stopped allowing transfers from UK accounts. I would still recommend them as a starter wallet though, somewhere to hold your bitcoin addresses.
Otherwise I think [BitCoin-24]( is the only other big site. They do online bank transfer or wires. Wires are too costly (unless you are doing large transactions). But SEPA transfers are ok, as long as your bank will do the GBP-&gt;EUR exchange and then send it over SEPA for little cost. You'd need to check with NatWest. BitCoin24 will also charge €1.24 per transfer.
Others have mentioned BitInstant, but I don't think they accept anything in the UK.
There is a definite market for an online version of localbitcoins, where buyers and sellers can trust one another enough to do bank transfers and send BTCs.

It's a piece of paper with the key to your ~~safety deposit box~~ piggy bank taped to it.
edit: For adults:
Every bitcoin address has an associated private key. That key is what allows you to spend coins from that address.
A paper wallet is just a name for having the address and private key written down on on a piece of paper or other offline medium
The idea is that the private key has never been exposed to the internet, and even created on a secured machine, so it should not have been possible for anyone to intercept it.
A "wallet" is a collection of addresses and their keys. If someone stole your wallet, they would have all the keys to your addresses, and therefore coins.
Create your "paper wallet" (various ways to do this, I'll expand on it if you ask). When you buy your bitcoins, you send them to the address from your paper wallet. They now cannot be spent unless you enter that private key somewhere.
Keep the piece of paper safe. Make copies. Keep them safe.

For Android, you need root access to be able to backup the authenticator data stored on the phone. If you are rooted, you can copy the /data/data/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases/ folder, which contains the SQLite database holding the plain text version of the authenticator keys. Note it's a non-encrypted version...so this file needs to be kept securely.
When you restore to your new phone, you can just install the Google Authenticator app and overwrite these files.
If you aren't rooted, or run an IPhone, there is no way to get at the secret keys directly. For iPhone you can do a backup and restore via iTunes to restore your new phone.
When you add these authenticators, you'll see an encoded string along with the barcode. Something like 3WSSHSTWLE8EIJAE. This is the secret key to the authenticator. If you want to restore it later, save it off and keep it somewhere very safe and secure.

First, bear in mind that website is two things. First, just a view on the whole public bitcoin ledger, so can show you the balance of any address. That's what you were doing, and you can always use it to check your balance.
Secondly, they provide an online wallet. Whenever you create an online wallet, it creates a new address with new private keys. You don't normally see the keys but you can go into the Export page and download them. I would strongly suggest you use their Backup (lower right of Wallet Home) page to send yourself a backup of your keys.
If you are happy with where you money is, in the address you already have, then there is no need to move it. I say generally because it depends how you got it in the first case. If it was a gift, and someone else might know the private key, then maybe you should move it. If you created it yourself beforehand, then there is no need, although you can "import" it into an online wallet such as blockchain.info.
If you want to send money, you can login and use the Send Money page. It can be used to transfer coins from your to someone else, as well as between your own addresses.
I'm not such you need to, but perhaps if you say what you are trying to do, I can help. If you're new, it's a little learning curve to understand what's going on, but makes sense quickly.

The default, and preferred IRS method is to use FIFO (First In First Out).
The sale of 10 @ $100 would be allocated against the 10 @ $10. So your gain is $900. Leaving you a closing position of 10 @ $1,000. The tax you pay depends on how long you owned those 10 coins.  If it was a year or less, it is treated as income and so would be your normal tax rate. If more than a year, it would be long-term capital gains rate of 0% or 15%.
However, if you can show how the coins were bought and sold you could use specific identification, and therefore use LIFO, HCFO, Average or something else. Essentially you determine the strategy for how you allocate the coins from a sale to those purchased. This might be beneficial in this tax year, depending on their costs, date of purchase and tax rate.
For example, if you identify those 10 @ $100 sold coins against the 10 @ $1,000, then you have a loss of $9,000. That would be silly as you can only deduct $3,000 losses per year, so you would pay more next year. So instead identify the costs as 7 @ $10 and 3 @ $1,000. Now your gain is (1000-70-3000 = -2,070). A loss of $2,070 can be deducted this year and the remaining costs basis of 3 @ $10 and 7 @ $1,000 for next year.
It doesn't matter where you bought them, exchange, localbitcoins, gifted. In the end you received them at a cost and sold them for an amount, and the difference is the gain/loss.
Finally, if you sold some coins at a loss, but bought some within 30 days before or after, this will be considered a wash sale, and you cannot use that loss. Instead the cost basis is moved to the purchased coins.

I'm not an accountant, but my understanding is that you can choose specific identification. However, the IRS prefers and defaults to FIFO, especially if you couldn't show which coins were bought and sold.
For shares, you have to elect this choice and get confirmation from the broker beforehand. With crypto, that process simply doesn't exist.
If you were buying and selling general capital assets, for example, some valuable stamps, you would be identify this particular one as costing so much and how much it was worth when you sold it for. Since crypto-coins are capital assets until the IRS says otherwise, I see it the same. As long as you can show how you allocated which bought coins to which sell, it would work.
I hope this is the case, it's the foundation of the software I'm writing that imports all your trade history and performs different allocations to show the gains. You can then export the trade history for tax forms.

The question isn't just related to a Google account, but any website/account for which you have created an authenticator.
Yes, Google happens to provide an easy way to get back into your account, but many bitcoin sites don't. If you lose access your authenticator app (or phone) with all those keys, you have a problem.
So to answer the question, Android does backup configuration data for apps to Google servers (if you have it enabled), which in theory will be downloaded when you set up your new phone. Similar for iOS with Apple/iTunes.
As for Android manual backups, you need to use 3rd party backup software with root access.
As far as I know, this isn't possible on iOS, even on a jailbroken phone. This configuration data is encrypted by the keychain and so would be inaccessible. You have to rely on the iPhone/iTunes backup.
The best thing you can do is to take a copy of the "key" or barcode when you set up the authenticator in the first place. Keep that safe so you can add it again later.
If you have already have an authenticator for website but don't know the secret key, remove the authenticator and re-add a new one so that you can save a backup.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:09:55
Is it your opinion that wash sales are applicable to bitcoin? I've heard different views as 1) yes, since BTC are close to stocks until we have guidance, 2) no, IRS specially says stocks and securities
Likewise, could you use specific identification for your tax return, given that there is no way to submit such a choice to an exchange.

Yes, coinbase is very easy to use and good for 1st timers. Be aware that they can run out of coins to sell during the day, so retry later if they are out.
An important point is that by default you will get the coins at the price at the time when you make the purchase. However, it takes 3-4 business days for you money to leave your account and go in theirs. This means there is a delay before you see your coins arrive, and if the bitcoin price drops, you cannot cancel.
Your other option is to find someone in your area using localbitcoins.com. You meet up and typically hand over cash for coins.
One thing, your coins aren't actually stored anywhere, rather it is recorded in the public ledger (called the blockchain) that coins were transferred from one address to your address. Each address has an associated digital key and this is what must be kept secure. With that digital key you can have access to transfer the coins out of that address. This is akin to the physical key to a bank safety deposit box, except if you lose it there is no way to open it.
Whilst coinbase are as as safe as they can be, you do not control the keys to your addresses. Many people prefer to transfer them out of coinbase (and most other exchanges) into their own wallets. You can download and try a few of the client apps like the official bitcoin-qt, armory and electrum. Or, look at an online wallet such as blockchain.info where you are in much more control (the latter is also very good for beginners).
When you see talk off physical bitcoins, most of the time it is referring to paper wallets; a piece of paper that has an address holding coins, and its associated key. You would have to enter the key in order to spend the coins or transfer them to another address.
You can wire, but not to coinbase. However bitfloor.com or mtgox.com accept wires and are well known places to buy.

I wrote [WinAuth]( originally a desktop authenticator for WoW and GW2, but since that uses the Google Authenticator anyway it can also be used as a backup device for online services. When I add a new authenticator (I have about 10 from various sites now), I add it to my phone and winauth.
I run it on a separate machine but then provides a convenient alternative and backup.

Personally, I use blockchain.info. I have added my cold storage address as a "watch only" address. That way it shows the balance but doesn't need the key.

They already do. It's called capital gains for any profit you have made in trading, and income for any coins you have gained from mining.


Stocks make profit but aren't currency, until you sell them into currency, in which case it is then either income or gains.
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:56:04
IANAA but yes. Bear in mind there is no specific guidance, so right now general capital gains rules would apply.
When you sell BTC, it's a tax event, and you are realizing a gain or loss. Doesn't matter what you are buying: USD, services, other cryptocoins. So you should be calculating the gain you made with your BTC and that is taxable. It just so happens you are buying LTC.
If your LTC value then increases, and you sell and buy back into BTC, again you have made a gain in LTC and the same applies. You would take the sale amount of LTC minus their cost basis and any trading fees. That is the capital gains. Even though you aren't going into USD, you would have to specify a USD value of the BTC. There are no rules on how to choose the exchange rate, so you can effectively choose your method in good faith. Just be consistent in case you get audited.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:33:19
You can look at how vanitygen generates addresses, modifying that code to take each EC pair and then match the public key with that of a pre-calculated lookup of all known address hashes from the blockchain (there are only about 15M addresses that have, or have had, coins).
Let's assume the known addresses are evenly dispersed through the addresses set, 2^160, still means you would on average have to calculate 9.78e40 addresses to find a match. If a single machine can run about 3,000M/s address checks, it'll still take something like 1.0e24 years to find your first match.

Personally, I trust them no more or less than any other website where I have to give my bank details in order for them to withdraw funds. e.g. auto paying bills.
I have used coinbase many times and they have been fine. You hear about people claiming transactions being denied, but my understanding is there were some fulfilment issues early on as well as new non-verified accounts being flagged as high risk for sudden huge purchases. Get verified.
If you are concerned, create a new account with your bank solely for this. You can then give coinbase those details and only transfer in there what you want to spend.
Saying all that, I don't leave my coins in there once they are bought. I move them to cold storage.

Capital gains comes into effect immediately in the US. However, the tax rate you pay depends on your income and how long you've held the coins. i.e. a year or less, and it's treated as normal income.

Problem is, when you buy a different currency you are getting more because of gain.
For example, say I have 1 BTC which today could be used to buy 100 LTC. Tomorrow the price of BTC might have gone up, and now I can buy 110 LTC for my 1 BTC. When the trade is made I still have to get the fair value of the BTC and calculate any gains based on its original cost basis, which is taxable.
If it were consider a barter, it's worse. Because that LTC is actually considered as ordinary income and the BTC becomes an expense, which may or may not be deductible. Herein is the problem, these type of trades haven't been defined by the tax authorities.
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:00:29
Absolutely right. Bitcoin is not instant payment and shouldn't be used like one. On-line stores wait for 6 confirmations, no reason why person-person shouldn't either. I guess an escrow, or other 3rd party holding account would be the only way to solve this.

When you initially add the authenticator in MtGox, it shows a Standard Private Key and Secure Private Key. These are the one-time passwords that are used as the seeds to generate your codes.
Copy these down and put them somewhere safe. They are as important as your normal password, so treat it as secure as how you store your password.
If you need to recover from a lost phone, you can use the Google Authenticator and add a new account, and do "enter key provided" using the Secure Private Key from above. That will regenerate your same authenticator.
@_date: 2013-03-29 05:27:59
No, not really once the transaction has been sent and broadcast to the network. It gets put into queues and the miners decide (based on fees and priority) whether to include it or not in the next block. Over time the priority will increase and it will get included, but may take hours or days.
edit: actually it is theoretically possible to double spend the coins from somewhere else with a fee so they get  included in a block sooner. Then the original transaction will get discounted by the network as being invalid. Get the private key from your address, put it into another account/client, and spend them from there instead. But you run the risk of either going through.

I want to come back and add an extra comment here just to give you more info. Yes, you are due to pay taxes only when you convert it, but what taxes depends on when.
At the moment, given there is no law specific to cryptocurrency, it would be taxed as capital gains as long as you had held them for one year or more.
The rate you pay depends on your normal filing rate. If you are low/lower income filer (&lt; $36k for a single person, $72k for a joint) then your CG rate is 0% (zero). If your tax rate is above (i.e taxable income &gt; $36k/72k) then your CG rate will be 15%.
If you cash out before a year, the profit is treated as income and added to your normal taxable income. Depending on your tax situation, that may or may not be a good thing.
@_date: 2013-09-04 14:31:14
I was always afraid something like this might happen. Personally, I don't buy into the excuse that it's a secure application and therefore there should be no way to backup your keys.
One of the reason I created [WinAuth]( was for a way to keep backup authenticator keys for Google authenticator, Battle.net, GuildWars and so on.
Unfortunately, for iOS there is no way to get the key out once it has been added. You would need to remove and add a new authenticator into your account and save the key off somewhere yourself.
Similarly with Android, where the the keys are stored unencrypted in its protected store. But this means if your phone is rooted, they can be read. Be aware though, this means not just by you, but also any malicious apps that might get root access.

Money transfers between accounts in the US should take no more than 3 business days, is free, and can can be done with most internet banking systems.
Potentially 1 business day if both of you use the same bank. e.g. If you both use Ally, their person-person transfer takes 1 business day with no fees.
So why would you use bitcoins?
Funding your bitcoins takes 3 days (usually with a fee). Plus you are buying the coins at an ask price and your friend will be selling at another price. Market fluctuations may mean he loses money. He then has to transfer back to his own account/currency (another potential fee) and as long as he meets the minimum transfer, and that can take 2-8 days.
