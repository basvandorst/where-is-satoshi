I've bought several times in the past mostly to explore and have watched every documentary about it that I've come across. I believe in the need for it, but I don't trust in the powers that be to allow it to flourish uninhibited. We say no one controls it for technical reasons, but anything can be taken over. That being said, the "endgame" for bitcoin seems very unclear. Most people that talk about bitcoin or are long on bitcoin see it as a retirement strategy and intend to cash out into USD or some other currency at some point in time. Then there's the idea of it replacing common currencies. The volatility just does not allow for that to happen. Sure, maybe in the distant future that won't be a problem, but at what point would the value of bitcoin just be 1 bitcoin (some have joked about this)? Also, the type of events that have to take place for bitcoin to be the standard currency are decidedly terrible. We just don't live in a perfect world so even if I believe it's a perfect currency or tool then I still have to believe in other extraneous factors working out just fine too. Not here to ruin anybody's optimism as I'm obviously not able to see into the future. Everyone doing well right now hopefully won't get burnt. Plenty of people did come out ahead even after the dot com bubble burst, but most of them were behind the scenes and most "regular folk" got the short end. Very similar things are happening now that were happening during that bubble, but once again there's no guarantee either way. It's possible that all will come of this is that the Winklevi will just control an obscene amount of money. I'd like to hear where exactly others think this will all end up.
