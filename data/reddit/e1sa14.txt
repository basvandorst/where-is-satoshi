Yup, this market action is unprecedented. Way too unpredictable to see any serious trends.

Get real, no one asked you to do it in the first place. If you really want to get your information out there and help the noobs, create a post instead of individually finding them.

Stop pushing your information on every thread and go create your own post. It’s annoying.

No one is certain what will happen when futures market opens. Could go one way, could go the other.

You’re at the right place, no worries. r/btc is full of shit 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:24:28
You are paying the premium for the convenience Coinbase gives you in helping you to secure the coins. Do your research first. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:47:41
That’s nothing 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:17:51
I don’t think that is true. If Coinbase didn’t exist, people will find another way (the next most convenient) to buy btc.

Your IC/ID is different from your driver's license...

No, Coinbase is excellent as a starting platform for buying btc

I addressed something which irks me and gave a solution. That’s not rude, that’s productive.

The sell wall at 17250 is frustrating 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:09:20
Create a post, if it’s good it will go top and everyone will see it. You are ignorant. Bye.

Many factors contribute to the fast growth of btc. Not just Coinbase. It might be the biggest factor like you said, but in the end there’s no way of ascertaining that

Fucking finally, it’s been there for almost 12 hours!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:29:51
LOL true

110% yes

crash and dip are two completely different things

This is in Singapore for those wondering 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:47:41
no one knows exactly why yet, calm down 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:17:34
That’s separate from the previously ‘high fees’ everyone was talking about. This fee you are talking about is for coinbase providing the convenience of buying btc and for them to make money
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:44:52
It’s the first major coin and the one which led to the spawn of hundreds of other alts which follow bitcoin’s mainframe
