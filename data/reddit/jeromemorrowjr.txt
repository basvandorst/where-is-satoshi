Why's that?

More ATM's will increase the likelihood that people will buy BTC. More demand = higher price.
As of now, we have to transfer money to a website, wait days for it to be processed, then trade with someone. If people could use an ATM... easy.

Confused as to how you are getting a discount. 
I.e. 1btc = $100
Spend 1btc
1btc = 80$ 
Now you have spent 180$ and you have 1btc and a shirt that cost you $100. 
How is this saving money?

Unfortunately, I live in Canada and our banks don't have routing numbers. Trying out BTC-E but having trouble actually getting funds into my account.

Increasing the number of ATM's is critical. At this point acquiring BTC is not for the mainstream consumer. The process is simple with only a few steps, but in the same way that fixing a minor issue with wifi is simple. Most people would rather call their ISP or take their computer to a shop than Google a how-to.

Great. Thought the recent dip in BTC was a result of this news...

Decided to try BTC-E but it won't let me buy 0.1 of a bitcoin for $79 USD. Do I actually have to buy a whole btc?

Ok, I got it now. 
Thanks for clarifying.

What does this mean for those who have registered with VoS? If I convert CAD for BTC, will I lose my BTC?

Wasn't aware... 
If Bitcoin is ever going to reach the heights we'd like to see it reach, quick and easy accessibility is a must.
