I have been using Coinbase for years, no issues.

This is good for bitcoin.

I like how they moved $18 million dollars with a 4 dollar fee.

Not selling but definitely moving my BTC off exchanges which I should have done in the first place.

I picked up a Pyramid Apex 5400 on eBay. The 7xxxx series is a bit newer so may offer more flexible. 
I wasn't to interested in adding coin support but Adafruit has a coin acceptor which you can train.

I am only working on OpenExchanger.com but was happy to see there is another project to share with.

Taco, do you still have a copy of this? Your dropbox link has expired.

I'm working on a Raspberry Pi Version as well. You can read about it more on   I plan to push my code up next weekend.  I took a little different approach as it will need a wifi connection.  The general plan is that you put fiat currency in, press a button when your done loading money and it will print out a paper wallet with the funds on it.
I had a hell of a time with getting the validator to work right and ended up reading pulses.  Glad to see there are others working on this type of thing and open sourcing it as well. It's been a lot of fun to tinker with.

If you are in the US, you will have to watch out on the credit card side.  It's a little unclear on legality (as far as I have read) plus you could get into a chargeback situation.

never said a word... At that time, this was way before InfoWars back when he was doing a community tv show in Austin.

Wiring can be a very complex process when dealing with Primary, Intermediary and tertiary banks which is what you have to generally do when you go global (and depends on the country).  If they wired to someone in the US, that's easy.

This is good news!

Thanks for this!  Having worked on something similar with a Raspberry PI, I can attest this is not easy. There is a LOT of technology going on and it is a great learning experience.
I should be use to the negativity in these threads, but I'm not.  Someone put a lot of hard work into doing this and these comments are ridiculous.  "You shouldn't make a clear box", "It should be this...", "It should be that..."

I'm not expert in bill validators, but supporting currency seems to be pretty easy as it's contained to the validator itself.  If it accepts the dollar as good, it will report back to this program the number of pulses you configure per dollar.
As far as USB goes, I actually tried that approach for a while but my 5400 wasn't suited for it plus it took up one of the two ports on the USB. I believe the Apex 7000 takes it. You should look at Cash2BTC.com.  I know they were leveraging the 7000 but I don't think they opened up there code.

I'm actually looking for everything but money. I could use some help to talk through issues around Raspberry Pi/Breadboard/Power questions along with some Python guidance.  
I'm a hack at best, so the issues I'm running into currently is how to power everything I need with one source.  I'm currently running two power sources and would like to consolidate that down to one 12V source that can send 12V to the bill validator and 5v to the PI.
If you want to help, hit me up via PM or through twitter

Wire fees are pretty steep plus if this was converted to another currency that would be very high.

500 bits  -- giving this a whirl

Any idea on the line-up?

I have just recently started developing an open source Bitcoin exchanger based on Raspberry PI.  If you would like to help out, please hit me up on twitter  or check out   I launched the site this weekend so there isn't much up on there, however I will be releasing the hardware specs and initial version this week. I could use all the help I could get!
I use the word exchange instead of ATM since that is technically what it is.

There was a good article on this yesterday. While I am owner of bitcoins and love the concept, I myself have been a hoarder.  Just yesterday I ordered something from Adafruit which just started taking BTC and opted to pay with credit.
This is a problem but the ongoing volatility sure does keep me saying I should hoard.
Here's that article on why BTC is not a currency... and after watching the past few months, I tend to agree although when I do actually use it as a currency I love it.

I'm sure there are a number of factors but what personally brought me over here was the public news on Silk Road which highlighted BTC as an actual currency.  A few other events (Cypress/Greek fallout) + China volume + German/Canada legislation have really kept this topic in a lot of mainstream media news outlets as of late.

Interesting, I thought the transaction fees where dictated by the bitcoin sender? How does a country as a whole drop the fee? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:20:16
Perfect. Thanks!

Thanks for the additional businesses, I'll be checking these out as well!

Other than contributing to the cause, is there any real reason to actually get into Mining at this point?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:25:34
This is such a great looking device! Can I ask how you made the enclosure? It's a sharp looking.

I came here and I am not disappointed.  Another happy Coinbase user here.  Yes, verification sucks but that's life.
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:40:23
I'm basically in the same boat, I gave them that information but stop short of the additional information they asked for (utility bills, drivers license, etc).
