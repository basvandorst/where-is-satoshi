This is incorrect.  "scaling" literally refers to handling throughput, i.e. transactions.  Larger blocks = more transactions = scaling.

Lol.  Neither banks nor coinbase can steal your money.  Both have to obey US law.  It's the unregulated sites (like Gox) that you need to watch out for.

This is incorrect.  When Satoshi first introduced the blockchain, the blocksize cap was 32 MB.  He then lowered it to 1 MB in a hard fork.

Bitcoin was first digital currency based on trustless PoW and thus revolutionary.  The only thing you could really compare it to is Bit Gold which more of a thought experiment than anything else a decade earlier, likely produced by the same guy: Nick Szabo.

Just another tech guy who doesn't understand what "contentious" means in practice.  Classic doesn't take effect if it's contentious.  It only takes effect if the majority of full nodes have upgraded *and* the majority of miners have upgraded.  The former occurs because miners want to be able to sell their mined bitcoins, and so don't support any hard fork that lacks full node support.

If he's able to earn a living doing that, his "job" probably isn't manufacturing the bootstraps.  It's probably more like entertainment / customer service.  People are willing to pay a premium for your grandfather's product because it's him producing it.  Same with how about 90% of the job of a tailor is customer service.  The "tailoring" is the easy/trivial part.

I don't think your math works.  
Streaming 1 MB/second is tough for real world purposes (since you're probably not streaming video 24/7).  But I've downloaded several terabytes worth of data over a weekend without any problem.  If bitcoin blocks were 4 MB every 10 minutes, that still only adds up to 6 x 24 x 7 x 4 = 4032 MB = 4 GB per week.  I've downloaded 500x that much in a weekend with no problem and my ISP (Comcast) never kicked me or throttled me.

And many of the core devs are paid by Blockstream which are funded by venture capitalists.  Core is compromised.

Well articulated, thanks.

Bitcoin uses hashcash's PoW algorithm.  It's one small part of what bitcoin is.  Bmoney never actually existed.
It's kind of like your asking what's the difference between the first car ever made versus a kid's crayon drawing of a car.  Conceptually there are some similarities but the attribute of *existing* is a major difference.

Coinbase has added a lot more value to the bitcoin ecosystem than BitTorrent.  I can't tell you how many friends who asked me about buying bitcoin, and were convinced to invest because coinbase makes it so easy.
@_date: 2016-02-09 17:49:49
Ah okay.  But 1.25MB per second is still 750MB every 10 minutes, is still 188x more than needed to handle 4 MB.
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:19:30
4 MB every 10 minutes continually fora  month is just 4 x 4 = 16 GB per month.  You really think comcast cares about that trivial amount of data?

Right, the issue is that technology has allowed for higher quality and cheaper mass production of almost everything.  "Hand-crafted" today, is usually lower quality than the best factory made products, and generally much more expensive.
So why do people pay a premium for the "artisanal" stuff?  On rare occasion they're paying for customization or truly higher quality, but usually it's the experience or the idea.  They like visiting the musty bookstore and chatting with the shopkeeper, or visiting the old cobbler etc.
Here's how to test if your grandfather is selling a product or himself: if he offered his goods only on Amazon and with no mention of himself, would they sell just as well?

Miners don't define protocol, only double spending.  Full nodes (specifically the economically important ones like exchanges) define protocol.

Well, energy consumption has negative externalities (air and water pollution) among other things.  There's certainly a societal cost associated with PoW.

Basically, the core devs managed to wait out the rest of the community.  A triump of autocracy.  6 months ago, the whole community (including Adam Back CEO of Blockstream) agreed to larger blocks soon but disagreed on the specifics; SegWit was still 8+ months away.  Now that SegWit so waiting seems more reasonable.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:52:20
SegWit doesn't exist yet.  And once it is released, it only increases size to about 1.7 MB, which will (hopefully if bitcoin continues getting adopted) only buy us 6 months.  Now, SegWit is fairly close.  When core devs first turned their noses up at the community, it was still 8+ months away.  What most of the community has been saying all along is that SegWit and LN are great.  But while we wait for core devs to code them, we want a blocksize increase in the mean time.  Core devs basically told the miners, exchanges, bitcoin companies, and large users to go to hell, and then they get mad when Classic comes along.
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:23:22
What part of it don't you understand?  Miners say they want larger blocks.  Core devs refuse to give them larger blocks.  Other devs write code for larger blocks.  This isn't rocket science.  
@_date: 2016-02-10 22:02:48
Some things produce positive externalities.  For example, some people have toyed with the idea that the PoW algorithm could be replaced dynamically with real-world math problems (weather forecasting, protein folding, etc), so that as miners try to solve the PoW, they'd also be doing something useful.  I don't think it will work, but it's interesting to think about.
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:23:15
I'm not a computer scientist or cryptographer so I can't offer specifics, but my guesses:
1. the type of problem determines which hardware will best be able to solve it.  Some miners will prefer specific types of problems, which creates a political battle.
2. It might be hard to know the difficulty of various types of problems in advance; to accurately determine and specify the difficulty being presented to the network.

This is a common misconception.  If 75% of miners mine a particular fork, the fork is not contentious and the "failed" fork will die very quickly due to simple math.  What happens when block confirmation times increase 4x+ fold?  The vast majority of users will switch to the better blockchain.  Basically, bitcoin provides a virtuous cycle wherein the failed fork will fail very hard and very fast.
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:31:28
Not really.  
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:32:42
Think of it like a presidential election.  Before the election, the country is roughly split and it's truly contentious.  Immediately after a winner is announced, the vast majority of the country accepts the results and the identity of the president of the united states is no longer contentious.  In a bitcoin hardfork where 75%+ of miners and full nodes support a particular fork, the moment the fork happens, the vast majority of those supporting the losing side of the fork will simply accept the longest valid chain as the current bitcoin blockchain.  Just as a presidential election goes from 51% supporting the winner to 95%+ accepting the winner within a day, so too will a bitcoin hardfork go from 75% to 95%+ within a day.

The negative interest rates in question are very small.  Securing physical cash would be substantially more expensive.
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:22:06
More like a win for a somewhat arbitrary group of tech insiders.  Basically, a dozen core devs and the blockstream CEO won, everyone else lost.  DOS attacks on "bad" nodes played a part.
@_date: 2016-02-09 19:41:26
Wait, then isn't Core an alt since Core includes in its roadmap changes far larger than Classic's?
