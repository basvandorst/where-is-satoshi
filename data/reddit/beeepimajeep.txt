This leak only hurts mt gox users... people need to stop...
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:57:29
I don't see the point in this.  If he wants money, there will be hundreds of lawyers willing to take his case for free.  He already has a big cheque coming his way.
tl;dr - this is stupid.
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:05:39
appears to be good research.  i think most people are looking to the future though.  if bitcoins are worth 10k in 3 years, then the current rates are dirt cheap.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:15:25
why are these clowns controlling the PR...
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:50:17
why not publish that 27 page document?
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:19:21
fair enough, ya the whole issue is very muddy and fwiw, i agree with you.
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:24:43
as do i :)
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:15:20
Scam alert.  This guy has made several promises on Dogecoin forums, and has yet to fulfil ATM orders.  
Hopefully bitcoin subs are more savvy.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:18:23
knowledgable guy, but ignorant and delusional.   
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:47:43
Fair enough...but if I broke your window, and you could get me to buy you a new house...why would the community fix the window.  Just let him get a brand new house.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:30:54
i agree with waterlesscloud
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:06:49
It's because people realized how stupid the bitcoin community is...
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:38:55
ffs, there is 0 chance this guy is satoshi.  what is wrong with u lemmings.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:14:47
were you looking at prices in CAD?  i did that earlier by accident today 
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:34:51
I hate to say I told you so, but because i got flamed so hard at the time...
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:34:02
fyi, definitely a scam.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:42:54
REQUEST: hackers plz stop posting info... you are hurting our chances of getting money back.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:00:21
I like how Charlie Shrem plays dumb on his twitter....what a scumbag.
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:09:54
stop ppl saying u don't want gox to survive, a lot of us have lost a lot of money on there :(
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:37:56
Awesome answer, thanks Kale

Bitcoin needs to be regulated for it to ever succeed as a national currency.
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:06:46
Why is this a good thing?
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:11:02
Strange differential for both Panama and Japan
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:08:29
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:42:21
can someone explain to me why regulation is so bad?  
wouldn't it legitimize bitcoin and make it worth 10x as much?
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:15:14
not a fan of this idea...let a company bail out mt gox, or go down with the ship.  none of this create-a-market for junk coins.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:36:27
Does this mean they have 915k BTC?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:58:19
definitely a wolf
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:01:17
ummm you don't need a source to figure that out...idiot
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:42:10
I think it's weird he'd shut it down...like, it's still a market.  People are betting on it's survival.  What am I missing??
EDIT: I just realized, he's probably joining a lawsuit.  I'm guessing it's easier for him to halt trading and focus on getting money back.
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:19:44
wtf is wrong with you...
@_date: 2014-04-29 21:02:43
very thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:32:25
What are the reasons for closing it, was the trading volume too low to run profitably?
Also, if positive news comes out regarding Mt Gox (i.e. they find a buyer), will you open trading back up?
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:49:58
fyi I used tinkercoin about 2 months ago to buy my first bitcoins...great service and much faster than wiring money to an exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:07:27
beautifully said.  i feel the exact same way as eric fwiw, was pretty rattled about the leak (as well as him taking pride in it and selling his coins)
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:43:36
Then he should tell newsweek he wants 50k and story redacted.  The only person who wins from what we are doing is newsweek.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:30:16
they want to scam more money from people.  
why is karples still on the foundation?!?!
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:01:28
unless i'm missing something, nice find!
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:36:42
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:50:35
It's a security risk to put that many coins in a hot wallet. So separate it into different wallets only makes sense
@_date: 2014-03-09 13:10:41
andreas is extremely ignorant... snowden has provided evidence that the US is basically god
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:32:33
can someone explain why 10 accounts posted the same reply?
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:28:14
Update: we are arbitraging as hard and fast as we can.  need more money, stay tuned.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:52:14
I'm scared of what's going on right now :(
