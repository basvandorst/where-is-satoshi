Some possibilities include:
1.  Bitcoin isn't even decentralized due to mining/core dev cartels.
2.  Deflationary currency would destroy the world economy.
3.  Proof of work is bad for the environment.
4.  Satoshi could destroy the value of all bitcoins by flooding the market.

The incentive is that they all hold bitcoins. Bitcoins are worth about $440 each today. If those bitcoins are to ever reach, say, $10k each something like the lightning network is necessary. It's really that simple, no other motives are necessary.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:05:50
If they've contracted to allow use of their network for a specific fee regardless of the traffic and they are now attempting to block traffic they dislike contrary to their prior contract then such behavior should not be allowed. I rent, but as long as I pay on time and stay in bounds of my rental agreement my landlord doesn't have the right to tell me how to use the space until our agreement expires.

If we're considering Egypt I need a source for it being gold rather than Electrum, which was far more commonly used in that region. My main point is only that the value of gold to silver usually has well exceeded the supply of gold to silver.
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:12:59
Only M0, which is about $5 trillion, but M1 is about $25 trillion. So if Bitcoin were the only form of money it would overtake the M1 figure and indeed be a little over $1 million each. This is highly unlikely, but it doesn't exceed the amount of money in existence.

Not really.  If there were a trading engine incorporated into bank accounts it could avoid almost all accounting and instead merely send requests for balance transfers, no funds would ever touch the exchange and therefore there would be no real need for accounting.  Instead the exchange would merely take transactions from the blockchain proving bitcoins had been transferred and send a request for the agreed upon funds to the purchaser's account.  This would be an information verification service instead of an accounting service.
Sure, this is years away given the current attitude within banking towards Bitcoin, but it underscores the fact that an exchange isn't primarily about the accounting.  If you focus on how things are currently done rather than how they could be done more simply and smoothly to fulfill the same goal we'll never get anywhere new, and if Satoshi had held  your mindset focusing on how things are instead of how they could be improved Bitcoin wouldn't exist.

You're pretty much just wrong.  
All the Bitcoin in the whole world right now is only worth in the neighborhood of $10 billion.  This means even if you were able to buy and sell all of the bitcoins without affecting the price you could only purchase $10 billion worth of goods.  If Bitcoin is going to be successful it will be serving multiple purposes: currency, store of value, asset registry, and others.  It cannot do this if there is only a total of $10 billion worth of Bitcoin or less.  
After all, consider gold.  Gold is used almost exclusively as a store of value.  The total value of all gold in the world is around $8 *trillion*.  That's almost 1000x as much as Bitcoin.  So if Bitcoin is to be successful the price cannot fall long term.  Successful Bitcoin means a price at least 500x current levels, anything else will doom Bitcoin to a dearth of liquidity and ultimate failure.

Technically not that, either.  That requires (from the wiki) that the authority cited not be an expert, or that there is no true consensus among experts, or that the argument requires deductive reasoning from what the experts have actually said.  There is a fairly wide consensus among economists that deflationary currencies and the gold standard are a bad idea.  It's fine to disagree without being an expert, but that is the academic milieu right now so his argument doesn't count as an appeal to authority, either.

Because stealing a small stash of bitcoins is relatively useless compared to the NSA's budget and stealing a large hoard is too noticeable.  Especially when bitcoins are so easily traced.  Why steal if you could get caught for it or compromise your operation when instead you can just dip into your multi-billion dollar budget?
There are a few exceptions to this.  The NSA may have an operation in which agents pretend to be hackers and it would be beneficial for them to transact in stole bitcoins, perhaps.  On the whole, however, they won't be stealing from people just to have more bitcoin.

Hey Bruce, I hope you're well.  I am no fan of non-voluntary regulations, so I'm 100% on board with your sentiments here, but perceive a few points differently.


The alt coin point is valid and important, but I have a different view of the passage you're interpreting to mean a Bitcoin business can't own bitcoins. I talked with many people yesterday who share the literal interpretation you're using, including Erik Voorhees. I view this passage to mean retained profits only must be kept in dollar denominated instruments, but this would not affect the ability to hold Bitcoin reserves or an operating fund in Bitcoin.
After all, for any Bitcoin company bitcoins can be considered property necessary to do business rather than as profits. When a real estate holding company owns real estate their property counts as assets, but not as profit until sold. I hope the same type of accounting would apply for Bitcoin.
The portion of the proposed regulations in question could be strictly interpreted to mean what you and Mr. Voorhees fear, or along more common-sense lines as I hope. Bitcoin regulations are going to happen whether we like it or not. Therefore I hope someone will convince the regulators to clarify some of these passages rather than refuse to interact with them.
The end result, I hope, will be regulations onerous enough to drive innovation to other locations but not so harsh that they completely stifle Bitcoin growth worldwide.

It does need to be clarified.  It is certainly poorly worded right now.  But my interpretation makes sense and the OP's does not.
Think about this: if I hold a car parts company, do I have to sell every part I own every quarter?  Since Bitcoin is property to the IRS, it can be counted as part of the business property rather than profit.  
It's of obvious necessity for any Bitcoin business to have a reserve of bitcoins.  It is not, however, necessary for a Bitcoin business to use profits to try to arbitrage across exchanges.  I believe any reasonable judge would disallow the latter and permit the former.

Technically in this case, no.  *et alia* means "and the other **things**" because *alia* is neuter.  Since he is talking about people, probably a group containing at least one other man than Karpeles, the unabbreviated Latin would have to reflect the gender of the referents, so it would not be *et alia* but *et alii* for a masculine group.

Let me explain what you're missing.  No one thinks this means personal bitcoin-hoard insurance.  The whole point is that, as you stated, they'll be auditing Bitcoin companies and possibly holding bitcoins themselves in reserve.  If true this is huge because there would be vastly increased security in dealing with any reputable member of the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Companies previously too risk-averse to adopt Bitcoin will no longer have such reasons to fear.  This is one of the linchpins for real mainstream adoption that any of us who want to see Bitcoin grow have been awaiting.

Bitcoin isn't just for Libertarians, but it seems that you're jumping through some very torturous hoops to claim that is wasn't founded by one.  I tend to think this says more about your own desire to believe that **maybe** "satoshi's views ... align with yours" than anything else.

Not useful unless you also have records of how data was encoded at the time period.  By the time you have enough records to make such a practice useful you no longer really need the blockchain to go with the rest.
Also the best way to prove a specific physical copy is from a specific period will remain things like analyzing the type of paper used, chemical makeup of the ink, and key signs of aging.  If a semicolon wears out to the point that you think it was a comma the hash method is useless, however.  


Lots of ways: people quoting it, references in other texts, bibliographies, etc.  These are how we know what happened in the rest of the Epic Cycle even though only the *Odyssey* and *Iliad* survive.  


We have nothing from 10,000 years ago.  Our oldest forms of writing date to about 5,000 years ago, anything past that is prehistoric.


We need physical copies, especially on difficult to destroy media.  It would be far more useful to microstamp the Library of Congress on gold bars than it would to bloat the blockchain with all this extraneous information.

Here's where I'm coming from, you say:




But as to the second point, it isn't the withdrawals that are hard when money laundering, it's the deposits.  And I think enough people will be using Coinbase-type services if Bitcoin takes off that the same kind of red-flags will be in effect.  With money laundering the issue only arises when you attempt to make your money seem legitimate.  As long as you're using your illegally obtained cash to buy other illegal things you don't have to go through the trouble of hiding the source of income, you can just hand over a duffle bag full of cash and be done.  With Bitcoin, however, things are less anonymous and more transparent.  For instance, we in the Bitcoin community knew Gox had gotten access to 200k bitcoins before they announced it.  Those funds were easy to find, and it didn't even take the full might of the federal government to do it.  
So essentially it seems to me the point you've made (that cash loses its anonymity as soon as you try to do something large and legitimate with it) applies to Bitcoin just as well, but with Bitcoin there's the added benefit that all transactions are visible (not just the legal ones) while this is certainly not the case with duffle bags full of cash.

Furthermore, the continued existence of the blockchain implies an unbroken digital record. If there are such consistent digital records the blockchain will not be necessary to prove that dictionaries existed in specific forms.

You can't overplay the importance of cash pouring into the system in any sector because of the network effect.  More money spent on mining means more people have a financial necessity to keep the price of Bitcoin at current levels or higher to protect their profits.
In turn, the higher the price goes the more attractive Bitcoin is to merchants, and the more likely that some will hold their Bitcoin.  If merchants hold their Bitcoin they will attempt to get their suppliers to accept it, furthering the network effect.
The more miners and merchants involved and the higher the price the more money flows into the system from venture capitalists.  The more money that flows in from VC firms, the better the apps, services, and general offerings will be available.  
With more ways to use Bitcoin, more purchasing power for Bitcoin, and more places that the expanded purchasing power can be applied there will be more general adoption, and the more general adoption the more of a chance to make an impact on

Clearly the newly mined bitcoins are not the only ones on the market.  Old bitcoins are being traded daily, and in fact make up a majority of the market.  But the mined coins are not a negligible portion of the supply.  On many days we see fewer than 10x the number of mined coins sold, so we're dealing with a significant portion.


Also note that I never said that the price of a bitcoin must double, that is obviously false.  But there are ~$2m worth of bitcoins being mined daily.  If that fresh supply falls in half then we're looking at a significant drop in available bitcoins.  Equivalent demand (judged by amount spent to acquire bitcoins daily, one of my premises) but decreasing supply (lower block reward) necessitates a higher price.

I do not agree on smart contracts, because I think the term refers to more than just "announced but not released." According to Wikipedia vaporware is announced but ill defined and probably never intended to be released. Since Ethereum is in testing I think it's a safe bet that they do intend to release it and that many of the features are already known and in use even if not yet perfected.
As for a centralized resolver for Namecoin, there are open source extensions that perform that task so I don't know entirely what you mean.
Finally, saying that because at this extremely early stage (when there are still fewer than 5 million Bitcoin users worldwide) microtransactions haven't been successfully integrated they must just be a failure *in toto* is silly at best.

I disagree.  The rules you've outlined could be quite helpful as long as they remain guidelines rather than rules.  If Bitcoin users want to trade on a riskier exchange it probably means a chance for greater rewards and greater losses.  These risky procedures should not be prohibited, but they should indeed be clearly stated in terms of service.  I would choose an exchange that doesn't allow short selling whatsoever, or at least required users to opt in.  I would use an exchange that follows the guidelines you've described.  Just because you and I prefer these protections, however, doesn't mean they should be forced on all traders, even those who aren't so risk-averse as we are.

Oh, well I think I do know the problem after all. Coinbase can create a payment page or send out a request for payment through email. A payment page will have a qr code, an address, and a 10 minute timer. This payment page does not require a Coinbase account on the part of the purchaser. The email request for payment, however, is a request that the purchaser buy bitcoins through Coinbase that will appear in the seller's account. The payment page option is better for getting bitcoins from people who already have them, the email request for payment is better for getting bitcoins from people who don't have them yet.
So the person on the other end was using the wrong Coinbase service given that the purchaser already had bitcoins. This is a mistake even a very tech literate person could make.

Money that goes into Coinbase or Bitstamp pretty much only goes into Bitcoin.  Money that goes into BTC-e goes into Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, Novacoin, and Peercoin.  This means a lower premium on Bitcoin.  Because of this there are always more chances on BTC-e to get out of Bitcoin and into something else, which yields a lower price.
Why doesn't arbitrage level the spread?  Because arbitrage is not so easy as that when withdrawals take time and involve fees.  There is no quick, easy, and cheap way to get dollars out of BTC-e, so arbitrage doesn't work as well as it would if we were talking about a US-based exchange with a good relationship to American banks.

Define government. If you mean the structure and organization of society I would agree.

The Athenian government did not have that ability: instead they removed the right to participate in society from those they deemed unworthy due to bad behavior.

90% of the developed world, huh?  I guess you missed the LIBOR scandal, then.  The problem isn't lack of regulation.  The problem is regulatory capture.  And regulatory capture doesn't have any easy solution.  
Essentially you and Market-Anarchist are at odds because you have different goals and different means that find acceptable towards reaching those goals.  He wants Bitcoin to be a free market, one free of regulations and the accompanying regulatory capture.  You want Bitcoin to be safe, with recourse to legal tools towards solving and preventing problems.
Here's the thing: both goals are possible.  Voluntary regulations are the answer.  If a Bitcoin company wants to follow regulatory guidelines they may.  And they may advertise themselves as safer because of their approach.  And they may receive deposit insurance from private firms.  And they may broaden the market among users who want added safety for a predictable fee.  
Meanwhile, less risk-averse Bitcoin users could choose to transact outside of voluntarily regulated Bitcoin entities.  These users would not have the protections afforded by the companies offering voluntary regulation, but they would also offer increased anonymity and lower fees.  A one-size-fits-all approach is inferior and plays to only a subset of Bitcoin users, voluntary regulations can provide a Bitcoin experience that will be perfectly tailored to the risk profile of the user, rather than being either Procrustean or anarchic.

I have considered this, but come to different conclusions.  As far as I can see, Bitcoin is less anonymous than cash.  Even without requiring new bitcoin tracking laws it will be much easier for governments to do block chain analysis than to trace layers of cash transactions.  For this reason I'm not worried about how anonymity and Bitcoin fit together.  It will always be possible to hide your tracks to some degree with Bitcoin, but it will also always be easier to follow Bitcoin than cash.

My understanding of the regulations is that they illegalize creating altcoins even if the primary purpose of that coin is something other than value transfer, which is stifling. Also bitcoins can be used as a medium of exchange, and must be exchanged to make an entry in the blockchain as the author notes. Therefore even for ancillary services built on the Bitcoin blockchain these regulations could be enforced, which would stifle the growth of the really exciting things that could otherwise happen.

First, I love Bitcoin and want few things more than to see it succeed.  My point was to correct the false idea that somehow existing coins are worth more because of the MtGox collapse.  That idea is false because the coins from Gox were not lost, but stolen.


I trust USD less because of the criminal activities of the banking cartels.  Because of the ridiculous abuses in the sub-prime mortgage collapse.  Because of the fact that banks that are supposedly too big to fail do indeed fail, and take all of us down a few pegs in the process.  Because HSBC can get a fine for doing something that Charlie Shrem may spend years in prison for doing on a much smaller scale.
You see, those problems do indeed reduce my trust in the USD and are why I have turned my attention to Bitcoin.  And as the USD was thought to be unassailable a couple of decades ago but now is vulnerable, so can Bitcoin move from a position of waxing power to waning efficacy.  It is up to all of us not to make false analogies and to recognize the possible pitfalls of Bitcoin so they can be shored up rather than ignored.  Only by looking at Bitcoin through honest and open eyes can we help ensure its success, rose colored glasses help no one but the nay-sayers. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 19:26:18


They won't want to keep 100% of their profits on bitcoins, and as to the amount they do want to keep in bitcoins they can keep them all as reserves. They need the reserves before they can safely grow so there's no trick involved in building the reserves before they're needed in full.  
There's also no problem with keeping a Bitcoin denominated operating fund. There are lots of things that can be done with bitcoins other than retaining them as profits.

It wouldn't matter how the system is set up, widespread adoption must mean a higher price, there is no way around the math.  
Consider that in 2010 Visa moved about [$9 billion daily]( which is about the current value of all existing bitcoins.  But that's just one credit card company and does not take into account all the other things Bitcoin could be used for if adoption truly were widespread.  No one puts a house or a car on their credit/debit card, so transactions for those items would mean a need for more liquidity.  And if Bitcoin is so widely adopted many people would use it as a store of value, driving up both demand and price.  With widespread adoption there's no way the price could avoid going up, the need for liquidity would necessitate this rise whether most bitcoins are being instantly flipped or not.

I agree that his logic is severely flawed, but your retort is also lacking. He's off because he's engaging in a modified version of the one percent fallacy. You're only looking at the USD as the currency of the USA. Since the dollar is the world reserve it is the backing currency for a majority of world trade, including for many people who are participating in international trade though they have a different local currency. So the percentage of world trade done in USD far exceeds 7% despite the number of people who have dollars as their local currency.

Here's why that's incorrect: the primary function of an exchange is providing a marketplace and facilitating trade.  Accounting is, at this point, a necessary action towards those goals, but if it were possible to provide a marketplace and facilitate trade without doing any accounting, then there would be no accounting done.  Accounting is one of the entities multiplied to reach the conclusion of facilitating trade, but if it were possible to remove that entity it would be gone, therefore it's silly to call one of the means to the end the primary function when the end itself is far more primary.

I blame the government for:
1. Drugs being illegal.
2. Creating onerous regulations for all money services businesses.
3. Applying those regulations to Bitcoin.
4. Using those regulations as an excuse to rob mtgox.
I blame Mark Karpeles for being a liar about the effects of transaction malleability and for running mtgox into the ground rather than relying on transparency to get through the robbery his company suffered.
Why would you blame Charlie Shrem for getting arrested instead of the crooked government that arrested him and had previously robbed mtgox? Idiotic.

Oh, you got banned? That's too bad, I don't like restrictions on speech.
Anyway though, I honestly don't see your point. I mean, you've written a bunch of words but haven't managed to say anything. Why do you think Bitcoin will fail? Do you have a problem with Bitcoin specifically but believe another cryptocurrency will replace it? Do you think cryptocurrencies will never succeed because of government intervention? Because of the inherent superiority of the existing banking system? You aren't really making an argument, just naysaying. It's hard for me to take that seriously.
Some problems I have with what you've written:


They open up Bitcoin to volatility, fraud, regulation and personal identification.
Yes, the exchanges certainly are the choke points.  Yet we see new exchanges opening at a much faster rate than the old ones close.  New exchanges often bring some level of innovation that grows the system, whether that's the ability to perform short sells and buy on margin or insured deposits it is undeniable that the options are growing and becoming more professional over time.


But don't you see that money is stored value?  If I put some USD into Bitcoin it's only because I already worked and acquired that cash.  So in essence this is already occurring merely because of the nature of what currency is at its very core.  In fact, the idea that "buying in" should be impossible would doom the possibility of adopting that model from the start.  After all, by preventing me from using the value I've already created through my labor you would be devaluing my existing hours of work, and in favor of what, exactly?  This seems like utter nonsense to me.
There's more that I think you're missing, but this is a start.

You are right that velocity lowers the need for an astronomical value in order for Bitcoin to be useful, but remember that right now there are only a couple million people using Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin is to become useful for billions instead of millions it will still need a value a couple of orders of magnitude larger than where it is today.  
People claiming that a bitcoin will be worth over a million dollars haven't taken into account money velocity.  Nevertheless, if we are going to ever see international payments made in bitcoins then we're going to have to see a single bitcoin priced well into the five figure range.

I don't see your point when you differentiate between stable money and money as a store of value.  Stability can be flat, or even slightly increasing in value so long as it doesn't increase so quickly that the problems with lending you elsewhere mention occur.  For instance, if a form of money deflates such that it increases in value by 2% each year it could easily be factored into lending in the form of lower interest rates.  It's only impossible to have deflation *and* lending if the deflation moves too quickly for lower interest rates to be feasible.

On the one hand, the Bitcoin market is easily manipulated because of the lack of liquidity involved.  You need about 100,000% more money to manipulate the gold market to the same degree as the Bitcoin market.  
On the other hand, it takes sophisticated analysis to prove manipulation, and most who claim the market is being intentionally played with do not have the technical ability to prove their raw hunches.  
Also, many people who complain about manipulation mistake good old-fashioned profit-taking for some dark conspiracy to keep Bitcoin down.

This is more than confirmation bias.  If you were to ask me to be precise I would say that Satoshi was almost certainly a crypto-anarchist.  This is because he equated government involvement directly with the loss of freedom, which certainly no Progressive would do.  He wanted to remove government control from the money supply, something no Democrat or Republican would want.  He was concerned more with Libertarians than either of the main political parties, meaning he probably was not quite Libertarian but saw the Libertarian party as possible allies, while there's no evidence he was similarly warmly disposed towards Democrats or Republicans.
But the most important reason, even beyond his quotes, to believe Satoshi was a crypto-anarchist is that he spent quite a bit of time and energy coding the crypto-anarchists' holy grail: cryptographic money beyond government intervention.  Crypto-anarchists have been obsessed with such an invention since the early 90s, that Satoshi accomplished it says quite a bit about his leanings.  That alone is sufficient for me to believe that he was a crypto-anarchist.

500 years ago some may have said the same thing for slavery.  And while it's true that slavery has not completely disappeared, it is no longer acceptable and there is no nation in which it is legal.

So I rescind my comment about boldface though I still disagree with you vehemently on points 3, 4, &amp; 6.  
You can call smart contracts vaporware in a couple of years, but considering the concept has only been in serious development for less than one year it's far too early to start suggesting that no product may be forthcoming.  Do you expect people to begin writing code one day and a finished product to be fully beta tested and available the next?  Ethereum is undergoing testing currently, your time frame expectations seem absurd.
Next up, Namecoin isn't widely used, but that's because people haven't been adopting it not because it's vaporware.  It is possible to use extensions and proxies to browse the .bit domain space, so it seems ridiculous to me to call an active product anyone can choose to use vaporware.  At this point you begin to seem either disingenuous or uninformed.
Finally, microtransactions are absolutely a huge deal.

It was less than 500 years ago that slavery stopped being universally considered ok.  Before that it was so prevalent that reformers like the early church fathers didn't even try to get rid of slavery *within their own communities* but instead told masters not to beat their slaves excessively.
Women, until about 100 years ago were pretty universally considered inferior and incapable of looking out for themselves.  It was only 50 years ago that the concept that blacks should have the same rights as whites really began to gain traction.  We are still fighting over gay rights.
So keep on appealing to how things are done today, but beware that in 500 more years people like you may not be considered much better than we today consider slave-owning, misogynistic, racist, homophobes.  Or you can try to start thinking outside what you've been told all your life and look at the world through the lens of reality rather than programming, your choice.

1. I think the major retailers accepting bitcoins is a much bigger deal than gift card companies though I'll allow that through intermediaries you could get more than alpaca socks and drugs in 2013. Beyond the retailers the travel companies like Expedia and CheapAir accepting Bitcoin while PayPal moves in that direction are huge.
2. I should have included the caveat "without a credit card" perhaps, but if you think circle isn't a gamechanger I doubt you've used it. I bought my first bitcoins through Coinbase and have been a faithful customer since but I am certainly a convert.
3. For both HD wallets and multisig I was clear that they existed previously but have become far easier to use and far more common. Sure, Electrum has been around, by it's only very recent that your passphrase has been importable to mycelium or breadwallet. Hell, as much as I hate Apple it's only recent that iPhone users could download fresh Bitcoin wallets.
So if you've been around all this time why would you support a troll-ish comment claiming an 11 month decline to one quarter of the previous price is so bad? What about the 18 month decline following $30 and going as low as $2? If that didn't kill Bitcoin why would this? The price would have to fall to $80 to be a similar percentage decrease and we'd have to stay down for more than seven more months.

I realize that human trafficking is a bigger deal than most people acknowledge, but probably not as big as drugs.
The war example is dependent on lots of circumstances.  For instance, it may be illegal for me to sell American munitions to someone in somewhere-else-istan, but it could be legal for me to sell those same munitions to a corporation I own whose base is in the Virgin Islands and for that corporation to sell the munitions to the insurgents in somewhere-else-istan.  This violates the spirit of the law, but not the letter, and does not count as money laundering. 
Similarly, your example of using bribery to pay for goods or services in another country (you used private schooling) does not count as laundering.  It is not illegal to spend in Britain money that was acquired through bribery in another country, and the source of the income does not need to be concealed or falsified, therefore while bribery is an example of corruption spending your bribes abroad is not money laundering.

Not necessarily.  All banks could work within Bitcoin and no one gets an advantage, but if Citigroup puts out their own blockchain all other banks are at a disadvantage.  This means that it's conceivable that there would be dozens of competing blockchains, but dozens of competing chains don't interact as well as one massive chain that everyone can use with roughly equal access.  So there are benefits to using Bitcoin on that front.
Furthermore, these trillion dollar banks can merely buy up multi-million dollar mining farms as if they were nothing.  This gives them votes on how Bitcoin functions.  This may be bad for Bitcoin, but it certainly isn't a stretch to see it as a possibility from the banks' perspective.

Look into the concept of the [world reserve currency](  It's the dollar.  If you want to trade internationally, you do so in the US dollar rather than the British Pound, or the Chinese Yuan, or the Russian Ruble, or the Euro, or the Japanese Yen.  The dollar is the world currency, and has been since the British Pound Sterling lost that distinction around the end of WWII.


And because the US government controls the world reserve currency the US government is the most powerful entity on earth.  Why do you think the government can fund building such an extensive military?  You may answer that we do so by borrowing, but what you're missing if you were to give that answer is this: why would other countries loan us money if they know we're just going to use that money to build a massive military and promptly use that military to control them?  They loan us money because they have to, because the loans are denominated in dollars.  So the only way to participate in international trade is to acquire US dollars by loaning money to the USA, which is then used to bulk up the military to ensure the continued dominance of the US dollar abroad.  It's a vicious cycle unless you live in the USA, in which case it's the foundation of our ability to get goods and services we don't really pay for.

I'm not saying it wasn't a real firearm, I'm saying that it may not have really been full-auto.  I have built a couple of "assault weapons" but none were full-auto, so though I'm very familiar with guns I wouldn't assume I could correctly identify the internals necessary to make a semi-auto into a full-auto.  If you have handled full-auto weapons frequently (specifically the type of firearm that was on offer) and using that familiarity you examined the internals of the firearm being offered to you and can confirm that they were the right parts to enable full-auto then that's different, but you didn't say all that before so I have no reason to assume it's the case.

The bitcoins aren't being destroyed, it's bitcoin *days* destroyed. A "bitcoin day" is a measure of the amount of time a Bitcoin has remained in one place. One bitcoin staying put for one day is one bitcoin day, 0.1 BTC being unmoved for 10 days makes one bitcoin day, 24 BTC sitting for one hour makes one bitcoin day. When bitcoin days are destroyed what's happening is coins that have remained dormant move, kind of like when a factory has an accident and has to take down their sign saying that it's been X days since an accident.

You can sell it for market price if you have enough gold to sell it on a commodities market instead of to a retailer.  The retailer has to make a profit, so they buy below market price and either resell to other individuals, or melt it down (in which case they only receive back 95% of market value, so obviously they must buy for less than that to turn a profit), or they can accumulate enough to sell on a commodities exchange in which case they must pay less than market value both to make a profit when they sell and to hedge against possible drops in spot price between buying from you and selling on the exchange.

I see here that you're an idiot, so I probably shouldn't type more than this, but I guess I'm a sucker for educating morons.
Remember what I said before about Bitcoin not being mature?  Hold that in mind, if you're capable of it.  Then try and tell me why they wouldn't transfer sales into dollars since they, at this point in history, need dollars to keep their servers going, pay employees, buy electricity, and restock their wares?  In a decade that might not be the case, but 5 years in it certainly is.
You see, in the mid-90s the internet was not yet ready to handle the massive portion of world trade and communication that it does today, and a similar amount of time into its existence neither is Bitcoin.  What kind of idiot would expect otherwise when the infrastructure remains at the level it is today?


No, because arbitrage does not have to occur across exchanges alone.  If I could buy a bitcoin for $1000 then take it to a website like overstock.com and buy $2000 worth of goods then that would drive up demand for bitcoins and change the price.  Every transaction has a place in price discovery, not just those on exchanges.  So if every transaction has an impact on the price, then it is total transaction volume rather than exchange volume that we should look at.


I saw the link you're talking about, and your understanding, once again, is approaching shallow but has a ways to go before it even gets that far.  
You see, as Bitcoin saturated the programming and computer science fields the volatility fell, but as the story broke to the general population the volatility increased again.  When Wall Street starts making Bitcoin derivatives the volatility will increase yet again.  Only with extreme growth from current levels can volatility fall long term.  But that growth is happening.  Wall Street is pouring money in and top notch programmers are putting vast amounts of time and energy into building the infrastructure.  
Once again, you seem like an impatient child if you expect 5 year old tech to be fully matured and stable already.  The technology upon which the internet was built existed for quite awhile before e-mail became everyone's preferred method of communication, if you can't see the similarities I'm surprised you can form a coherent sentence.
From here you lose the coherence I granted above.  Each word you type from here on helps prove my point that Bitcoin remains in its nascent stages.  Of course, that a website can do $124,000 in business in one day using a currency that remains so immature (and will remain immature for a couple of years even yet) bodes quite well for Bitcoin indeed.

First, it's already above 10 BTC.
Second, as was pointed out below, that's only about $6,250, and he'll need at least ten times that much if he's going to attempt some combination of suing, relocating, or hiring competent security for a long term.  Therefore I think a 10 BTC limit would be laughably low.

Gold and silver are not equally rare, but mining techniques in the ancient world made them closer in quantity than their physical distribution would have, thoguh gold was recognized as more valuable most of the time.

This is why he made sure to discuss blockchain technologies before delving into the regulations. Bitcoin transactions should be treated differently from dollar transfers because Bitcoin transactions are information transfers first while dollars are for value transfer.  Treating Bitcoin transactions as dollar transactions will limit the ability to innovate using the myriad other features of Bitcoin as an information technology. What will make Bitcoin better than dollars in the long run are those other capabilities that these regulations limit. If we can't use the full capabilities of Bitcoin we may as well just throw them out and stick with dollars.

That sounds about right. Look at it this way: if I sell you one bitcoin I have to replace it, so the first $580 is already gone. So I would get $20 profit, but then there are still risks on my end as seller. I'll have to go meet you (and an hour of my time is certainly worth more than $20). I'll have to pay for gas. There's the chance the price will rise between the time we agree on a rate and I can repurchase, which cuts into my profit. I'll have to at least consider the tax implications. And to top it all off you may be trying to scam me in some unforeseen way. $20 is only 3.5% of $580, I think that's a reasonable premium given the risks for the seller.

I'm sorry, but it is not feasible to pour $25M into a system that you believe will max out at only 8x that amount.  The risk/reward calculus simply doesn't work out.  Then you figure on the fact that $25M is only what Andreesen-Horowitz put into Coinbase and does not include other funds in Coinbase or the money that's flowed into Circle and Kraken and BIT and the rest.  There is simply no way that these firms are figuring on a value of a single bitcoin that remains in the mere four digits.  They could be wrong and Bitcoin could fail, but their investments prove beyond any doubt that they see at least a possible outcome in which a single bitcoin is valued well into the five digit range.
Please also consider that if Bitcoin is used worldwide it would have to have the capabilities to move hundreds of millions or billions on a daily basis.  A valuation in the four or low five digits simply doesn't have the liquidity to do that.  There is no success for Bitcoin if the whole network is worth only $210M or so.

False. Capitalism is not merely a free market. That would be anarcho-capitalism or agorism. Capitalism exists in an interplay of state and private industry, often blurring the lines between the two. This has been the case since before capitalism emerged from mercantilism and the rise of industrialization.
Bitcoin disregards limits imposed by the state and is therefore not in the least capitalist.

I don't know that, and you saying so makes me wonder if you know *anything*. Shrem was arrested in January of this year, mtgox accounts were seized in August of last year. Moreover the mtgox account seizure was for operating an unlicensed money transmission business, which according to FINCEN guidelines they absolutely were doing regardless of any association with Shrem.
The US government seizing the mtgox accounts to the tune of millions certainly had more to do with their collapse than Charlie Shrem did, but Mark Karpeles' incompetence may have had a still bigger effect than that. All in all your blaming Shrem for something that clearly had far bigger causes elsewhere makes you look exceedingly ignorant.

Ridiculously over-simplistic view.  There are so many community-enforcement methods that rely on responsibility and voluntary interactions, but if you want to convince yourself the only way to enforce standards is with the barrel of a gun you're only going to get enforcement through violence.
If you want an example of a community that vigorously enforced common standards without resorting to violence (and was far less violent than the USA) look to the Athenian Democracy.  They built a community in which the vast majority of enforcement methods involved exclusion from the community, and most citizens preferred to follow the rules than to be excluded.

So if you see a huge buy order at x price when you're about to buy, you wouldn't realize that if you place your order for an equal or lower number you'd have to wait until the massive order was filled before yours was filled?  Or if you saw a massive sell order you wouldn't put it together that if you attempt to sell for a higher or equal price you'd be stuck waiting that scenario, as well?  You don't think seeing price support at a certain level in the form of a large buy order would make small time traders feel more secure buying for a slightly higher sum given that there *seems* to be a near guarantee that they can turn around and sell into the buy order for only a minimal loss?  Or that when those support levels or removed the market would naturally react?

I think the only real question we have is whether the coins were lost or stolen, and wrapped up in that question is whether the wallets with 200k+ coins are genuinely MtGox's or not.

*  The CEO of Overstock is a huge Bitcoin fan and Libertarian, so your first point is the garbage here.
*  High volatility is a symptom of low transaction volume, the more people transact in bitcoin the better the price discovery mechanism becomes and the better the price discovery the lower the volatility.  Bitcoin is new, why on the blue fucking earth would you expect it to be mature after only 5 years?  Moronic assumption at best.
*  Overstock.com does less than one thousandth of a percent of all international business.  $124,000 is less than one thousandth of a percent of the dollars ever minted.  A penguin is less than one thousandth of a percent of all penguins.  Your last point is a total throwaway meant to bring you up to three bullet points but signifying nothing since if Bitcoin becomes successful there's no reason to assume more than 1/1000 of a percent of it would be traded on one site in one day.

As of now, this is true.  If Bitcoin becomes a major part of the financial system there may be derivatives and funds that stabilize the price sufficiently to make lending attractive.  Nevertheless, I do agree that it is unlikely that Bitcoin will ever be the currency for lending.  I also do not see this as a problem in the slightest.  
WHy not?  Because only a few zealots believe Bitcoin will become the *only* currency.  Bitcoin can be a deflating currency without any problems so long as there remain either less deflationary cryptos in which loans can be denominated or local fiat currencies.  So I see your point about deflation having negative side effects, but I don't think they'll end up applying to Bitcoin because of the many safeguards we still have and will continue to have against such an eventuality.

This will allow miners to sell bitcoins they have not yet mined, similar to grain growers selling grain they haven't yet grown.

I think this may be a misinterpretation. I think this means Bitcoin businesses can't play the stock market.
Let's consider the wording.  The document seems to mention retained profits.  Retained profits are profits that aren't reinvested into your own business.  Under my interpretation we could consider this regulation as if it were applied to a car parts wholesaler. In that case it would mean that the wholesaler could reinvest their profits by upgrading their computer system or buying more of the most commonly sold parts or increasing their advertising budget or hiring more staff.  They could also reinvest their profits in the approved USD denominated instruments.  They could not, however, reinvest their profits in stocks or real estate.
When applied to Bitcoin businesses it's clear that bitcoin reserves are as crucial to many businesses in the Bitcoin space as automotive parts are to a wholesaler.  Therefore I would think that bitcoins held would not count exactly as retained profits (after all, they are property rather than money according to the IRS) and what this regulation prevents is somewhat different.  Since bitcoins are crucial to Bitcoin businesses they must be on hand, but this regulation would prevent a company from attempting to play at daytrading with their profits.  This is a very real risk given the track record of Bitcoin companies, and usually they've been gambling not just with profits but with customer funds.
If my interpretation of this passage is accurate then it's not the death blow it would otherwise be.

The condition in the OP was that Bitcoin is the future of money. If this were to be the case Bitcoin would need to be able to perform the functions performed by the currencies of today.
Given that every day billions and billions of dollars are transacted instantly with little to no slippage then no matter how high the velocity of Bitcoin is such transactions are simply not possible at this valuation.
When you talk about transferring a billion dollars over the course of a year with slippage of 25% that is pretty much exactly what I meant when I said Bitcoin would have to remain niche technology rather than being the future of money as the OP asked.

No, capitalism is the idea that the means of production can be owned by individuals, how the individuals come to own the means of production is not part of the equation at all. For instance, capitalism and colonialism went hand in hand to forcefully deprive indigenous and native peoples of their property and pass those violently obtained means of production to the colonizers. This process was hardly voluntary. 


No. Anarchy is the abolition of hierarchical structures in society. *Most* anarchists take private property to be a hierarchical structure and seek to abolish it. You have clearly only read a bit of Hayek and Rothbard at the most and ignored the long tradition of anarchist thought and are here making absurd claims as if you knew what you were talking about, yet to anyone who knows anything you come off as ridiculous.

First I have to say that Bitcoin is obviously not yet ready to be any real nation's primary currency. The transaction limit alone is sufficient to prevent it. So we can't be speculating about the present as much as about a possible future in which Bitcoin has been significantly improved.
In our hypothetical future I think only a country like Argentina, Greece, or Cyprus that's already in trouble would consider such a move. By the time Bitcoin is ready, however, those nations may be out of trouble and new ones that seem fine now might by in worse shape, time alone can tell. 
It's also possible that a small nation like the Isle of Man could be the first mover, though the smaller the economy and the fewer the citizens the less likely it is to produce a domino effect.
If this happens one of the other prerequisites is that first hardware wallets must have become 
1. Ubiquitous
2. Extremely affordable
3. Almost perfectly secure
If bitcoins aren't so easy and safe to use no nation in its right mind would switch.
Finally, there is no possible projection for when such an event would occur. Hardware wallets and an increase in the transaction cap must be in place first. It is not when these things happen but if they happen that this shift would be feasible. It is my hope that these issues are fixed and we can see this within the next decade, but I am not overly optimistic about this scenario playing out any time so soon.

I never said I was against private property, I'm against sloppily redefining words. 
Capitalism has been inextricably linked to colonialism and mercantilism since the term first arose in the 1600s. Something like 90% of anarchists through the past 140 years have been opposed to private property. These facts make it impossible for the intellectually lazy to come along at this point and equate the two without completely shitting on history.
That long and indisputable history of anarchist thought is, in fact, the reason the term volunterist is even necessary. If that history didn't exist it would not be necessary for people who are generally anarchist *except without an objection to private property* to differentiate themselves from the mass of anarchists with a new word.
As for my personal take on everything, I am more a volunterist or an agorist than an anarchist, but I know plenty of traditional anarchists and **NONE** of them would take the statement that "anarchy = capitalism" without at least severely ridiculing the person who made such a ludicrous claim.

I know you aren't being deliberately obtuse when you say:


Nor are trying to be such by saying that:


But the process is harder than that because the parts you would have to swap out are legally regulated to an extreme degree.  This means you can't simply go buy a full auto conversion kit and make your firearm full auto.  Furthermore, the parts that could be switched are all registered, and to transfer them requires jumping through the same legal hoops as if you purchased the whole gun.
You could argue that there are many machinists who could manufacture such parts illegally and sell them on the black market.  There are several problems with this, however. 
First, such parts require precision machining to precise tolerances.  Merely making and selling them could easily result in blown up guns and customers willing to turn you over to the BATFE for an extended stay in federal prison.
Second, I know people who manufactured such parts when they were legal.  Yet none of these men still do so, even for close friends.  This is because of the aforementioned stay in federal prison.  Full auto weapons attract attention, and it is not as easy to get away with having one illegally as you may think.  When someone is caught in possession of one illegally they will be strongly pressured to give up the manufacturer, and most will.  Therefore few manufacturers are willing to risk their freedom by providing such parts.
Finally, the kind of person with the skill to make fully-automatic rifles can make them out of more things than you would imagine.  Making a fully automatic rifle is not functionally different from designing a semi-auto rifle.  As easy as it is to drop in a full-auto conversion kit for an AR-15, it's even easier to glue the firing pin in place on an SKS, which functionally turns it full-auto though the SKS design was never intended to be such.

Bitcoin doesn't remove the reason for their existence.  Let's consider some things people may want but that will never be available through Bitcoin unless existing financial services begin working with Bitcoin:
1.  Deposit insurance.  People love that extra level of security involved with deposit insurance, and that alone is reason enough that there will be Bitcoin banks if Bitcoin succeeds.
2.  Financing.  Bitcoin will continue to rise in value, which makes denominating debts in Bitcoin difficult. This means there will always be room for the legacy system, and it is possible that Bitcoin may never take over from fiat where loans and financing are concerned.
3.  Asset transfer clearing houses.  Yes, Bitcoin makes it possible to tie ownership of an asset or commodity to some small quantity of Bitcoin and then transfer ownership of that object instantly and globally.  However, since Bitcoin is irreversible that will not remove the need for large purchases of stock, futures contracts, real estate, etc. to originate from a trusted source.  No one will buy the title to a house without knowing that there is a legally liable entity if the ownership of that house turns out to be tied to a different fraction of a bitcoin and that the one sold was maliciously mislabeled.
4.  Escrow.  Because Bitcoin is irreversible there will always be a market for Bitcoin escrow services that can withstand major financial shocks.  These will likely arise out of the existing financial system as they already have the funding and risk assessment tools necessary for the job.

No, I get all that.  But I specifically said a million dollar valuation for a bitcoin.  I think that particular number will be out of range because even in our current system with a dollar that has very high potential for velocity and has had its supply sharply inflated we still do not have an M1 of $21 trillion, which is how much we'd need to support a bit = $1.  
I think the most we can ever hope to see the price of a single bitcoin ever reaching in our wildest dreams is $500k each.  Anything more than that is kind of ridiculous, even if Bitcoin entirely replaces the dollar.

One can sell a big chunk, then buy more back if they succeed in crashing the price to their desired level.  Huge buy and sell orders can also be entered to convince others to place their own buys and sells lower or higher in order to get in before the large orders are filled, thereby shifting the buy or sell price in the desired direction.  These are not difficult things to do whatsoever at this point.

Mind you, I don't think $10k is a certainty. Bitcoin could fail easily. But if it doesn't fail completely I am confident it will hit five digits. The future of Bitcoin is a binary proposition, and the positive outcome is definitely more than $1200 while the negative outcome is well below the current price.
Also note, I may well be willing to buy your coins for $1200 each in 2020. You have not once seemed cognizant of the fact that I've been taking about the future all along.

But would Hitler have recommended that more Jews drive Volkswagens?  Probably not, just like if I were trying to make something new I wouldn't be worried about whether or not it was appealing to the religious fundamentalist or neo-nazi communities.  The fact that Satoshi is concerned about the Libertarian community rather than the Krugmans or Rush Limbaughs of the world certainly says something about his priorities.
Let me put it this way: while those quotes don't prove beyond *any* reasonable doubt that Satoshi was a crypto-anarchist or Libertarian, they make it far more likely that he was towards that end of the spectrum than any more conventional Republican or Democrat.

I don't think that these people understand what happens if Bitcoin takes over a national economy. The results would be... dramatic.
To service a national economy the float would be wiped out across all exchanges. This would yield an over night jump in the price of Bitcoin by ten fold or more, and it would not be a bubble, it would be the beginning of a closed loop Bitcoin economy with millions of participants.
Tourists would have to exchange for Bitcoin to travel *and when they spent that coin in country it wouldn't get exchanged back for fiat but would remain in the closed loop.* And it would be the same for any individual or company doing business in that nation.
All of a sudden a nation that has been struggling has boatloads of a commodity/currency that is rising in value. This has to look tempting to the other nations on the brink of disaster. The first nation to adopt Bitcoin turns out to be the first domino to fall.
And then things get really exciting.

Actually the confusion is entirely introduced by the anti-gun crowd.  They picked a term that was very much like a technical term already in existence so that they could conflate the two categories in the minds of people who would otherwise not have taken a strong stance either way.
You see, an assault rifle is a subset of the category "rifle."  This wasn't a problem until people started using the intentionally vague term "assault weapon" to describe things that do not belong in the subset of rifles properly called assault rifles.
As to what you say about loaded or unloaded, it doesn't matter.  An assault rifle is any intermediate caliber select-fire rifle.  If it's unloaded it's still an assault rifle.  If it cannot go into full-auto firing mode, however, it is not an assault rifle.  The problem with the gun debate is much like the problem with regulating Bitcoin: the people making the regulations do not understand what they are legislating against and are acting on fear and unfounded prejudices rather than informed opinions.

I wouldn't buy right away, I'd wait for news of a fatal flaw in the protocol or of a worldwide ban or something like that. If something like one of those doomsday scenarios happened I'd join the dumping and mourn the passing of my hobby. 
If it turned out to be something non catastrophic like Mircea Popescu and his admirers dumping because they didn't like the block increase proposal I'd snap up all the cheap coins I could and I'd consider the exit of possible bad actors from the system a long term benefit despite the short term effect on price.


I'm in this purely for the long term. I never intend to sell per se, but I do intend to someday spend my bitcoins at a value considerably above my buy in price. We're still well above my average buy price, so this is quite feasible even if Bitcoin remains stagnant in price for a long time.


I disagree, uptrend or downtrend if you beat the amount of money you would have made by placing your funds in an interest bearing account I consider you to have made a good investment and if you do not beat the interest bearing account I consider it a bad investment. That's my simple calculation, but it's quite defensible simple or not.

You make baseless assumptions, I've drawn logical conclusions based on your statements. Those two things are not equivalent.
You look around and see many people with phones and internet then assume everyone must have access to those privileges.  
I used a simple syllogism to conclude you're from a more privileged background than many others: if a person is from the absolute depths of poverty they will not assume others have access to luxuries since they know many many people who don't. assumes others have access to those luxuries, and even considers those assumptions to be safe. Therefore does not come from the absolute depths of poverty.

No, an assault rifle will never be for sale at a gun show.  There is a difference between an "assault **rifle**" and an "assault **weapon**."  Assault **rifles** are intermediate caliber select-fire rifles.  They have been illegal to transfer (along with silencers and short barreled shotguns) without a special $200 tax since the 1930s, and they have been illegal to manufacture or import since 1986.  To transfer an assault **rifle** in addition to paying the $200 tax and putting your name on the registry you must undergo extensive background checks by the BATFE that take months to complete, submit fingerprints, get approval by your local sheriff for the purchase, and make sure that the weapon never leaves your possession unless it is being transferred to someone else who has gone through all the rigmarole I just described.
Assault **weapons**, however, are the things you may be thinking of that can be sold at gun shows and in private sales.  Assault **weapon** is not a technical term and basically just describes any scary looking gun, like an AR-15 or an AK47 clone.  Assault **weapons** do not necessarily have the full auto capability necessary before something can be called an assault **rifle**.

So many people support Gavin's proposal because they don't understand the other side of the debate.
No one thinks the block size should remain 1 MB forever. Literally no one. Everyone in Bitcoin knows that's unsustainable. The question isn't whether to raise the block size, it's how and when.
Raising the size requires a hard fork, so anyone who disagrees with the how and when of the proposal on the table may be left out. There are concerns about companies using larger blocks to become network parasites. There are concerns about miners using larger blocks to attack other miners and further centralize mining. There are other concerns I have read about and frankly do not understand because of my non technical background.
Everyone who wants Bitcoin to succeed wants bigger blocks. Not everyone believes Gavin's proposal is the right way to get there. Until you've read and fully understood all the arguments from all the core developers you should not take a passionate stance on this issue.

Your unsubstantiated guess of 100,000 is far more imprecise and unfounded, since you want to bring  up exactness.
The problem with using addresses to approximate is obvious, but it can cut both ways as there may be people who hold multiple addresses with less than one bitcoin as well as those holding several multiple bitcoin addresses.
In the end using addresses to build a guess is more conservative and based in reality than a number pulled from the air as it seems you did.

Did you not see this coming from Coinbase from the very moment they required identification when opening an account? If you didn't think the government was going to use them extensively to deanonymize Bitcoin you're naive.
In fact, if there weren't a way for the government to crush lazy bitcoiners they'd be coming down much harder on the whole ecosystem. As long as they can feel like they have a handle on this thing Bitcoin can continue to grow... 
Until at some point it won't matter whether they feel like they're in charge or not because there will be too much momentum to stop it. Before that happens we need organizations like Coinbase to give the regulators the illusion of control. It's a smokescreen, and we need it for now.

No, I get that part. The beauty of Bitcoin is that anyone can build proprietary extensions on top of the open source base. Then others will build competing extensions, some being proprietary as well while others will be open source. Today you can pay for Microsoft Office or you can use Google Docs, or even find a wholly private and open source alternative to either one. 
The same will happen in the long run with Bitcoin. Paid services will exist, so will more free and open services that are profitable through data mining, while anonymity and privacy will remain available through yet other means. The freedom to innovate will allow users to decide their own priorities: convenience, affordability, privacy, or some combination of those.

In the universe where so many people come just to talk shit without actually being involved.
Also I have to ascertain whether I should expect you to know why your comments are more pedantic than valid.  So since you care enough to own some I would assume you would also know that many bitcoins have been lost and many others have been intentionally sent to burn addresses.  
With so many (no one knows exactly how many) gone, we probably are closer to half the total bitcoins available than 61% since from here on people will be far more careful about storage and keeping track.  So if you know that, you must realize that even though you're technically correct that 61% have been mined you are being petty and ridiculous since it may actually be *less than* half the future total in circulation that are in circulation today.
Therefore if you do know these things, stop being so damned particular about the fact that more than half have been mined since we have no solid idea of how many will actually circulate, which is the real figure that matters by any reasonable rubric.

There's no term for jury nullification in Greek or Latin. The concept of the jury defying the law rather than defining it arose in England following the medieval period.

I think it's pretty clearly conditional. $1200 is undoubtedly not the best buy, but it certainly remains to be seen whether it's a bad buy compared to not buying at any point. It may turn out to be better than other good buys. 
If, long term, $5k turns out to be a good entry price then by necessity $1200 was, as well. Today the $32 buyers who didn't sell seem on point, even though they bought right before a $2 opportunity.
If you disagree, I'll gladly buy your 13 bitcoins for $32 each.

I didn't ask about politics, I am looking for concrete standards of success or failure. I need those concrete standards so I can decide what kind of node to run. If he doesn't know what failure would look like he doesn't have any solid reason not to increase block size. If he's unwilling to admit success is a possibility then he's a radical and can be ignored. If he's unwilling to respond to me because I'm just another pleb then he can fuck off. My opinion may not matter to him, but I can run a full node that relays 20MB blocks or I can stick to the old protocol so I intend to vote on this issue in a meaningful way.
I've withheld my judgment on this issue because I've been waiting for the core devs who are against Andresen's proposal to point out valid criticism and provide counter proposals. The only counter proposals I know of are A) a fee based economy, which is silly because it means Bitcoin doesn't really scale it just gets more expensive to use. This is clearly not the way to spur mass adoption. And B) the lightning network, which is not even close to ready and will also require a huge increase in the block size if it's going to allow for worldwide usage.
So since the only halfway viable solution is the 20MB block size I'm moving slowly into that camp, even though I see problems with that, as well.

Nope, you're wrong.  "Assault weapon" is the political term while "assault rifle" refers properly **only** to automatic rifles chambered in an intermediate caliber.

Please educate yourself better before trying to correct someone who does own "assault weapons" though I'm sorry to say no "assault rifles."

Here is a problem with what you're saying: you're confusing good and best. Any time you make an investment and it has gained more value than if you had put that money into an interest bearing account for the same amount of time it is a good investment.
No shit if you bought at $1200 it was a bad investment if you cash out now. It will still be a bad investment until the amount of money you could get by selling your bitcoins beats the amount you would have if you had put it in an interest bearing account instead.
This is why in my very first comment I put a time constraint. I believe the price of Bitcoin will outpace the value of money put into an interest bearing account within 5 years of today's date, even if someone purchased at $1200 in 2013.  If the value of those bitcoins has not grown past what an equivalent investment in an interest bearing account would have produced by 2020 then I'm wrong, if it has then I'm right and it was a good buy.
Let's say one bitcoin costs $10k in 2020. That would have outgrown an interest bearing account and a person who bought at $1200 would have octupled their money. Just because they could have waited 15 months and got a 40x multiple instead of an 8x multiple didn't make the 8x bad, it just means it wasn't the best.
You're acting as if we can make choices in hindsight. We can't. If in 7 years you have octupled your money you made a good investment, even if there were other chances to make 40x your money that you missed. As long as you beat the interest bearing account when you withdraw your funds you've done well.

This person essentially bet big that the price of bitcoins would go down, and he lost that bet. 
Since he thought the price would drop he put up some of his own money and borrowed bitcoins to sell. He believed that he'd be able to take the proceeds of the sale and buy back bitcoins to replace the ones sold, and since he'd be buying them back at a lower price he'd get to keep the difference between the price at which he sold the borrowed bitcoins and the price at which he bought them back. 
This would have yielded a tidy profit, if the price of bitcoins had fallen as he believed it would.  But since the price of bitcoins rose instead of falling when it came time for him to replace the bitcoins he had borrowed he was forced to buy them at a higher price. The difference between the total amount for which he sold the bitcoins and the amount he had to pay to replace them seems to be $240,000, which had to come out of his own pocket.

You're not helping win the war of ideas, if I didn't already have a firm opinion you would be much more likely to sway me *against* the core devs than in favor.

Here's why I am indeed OK with this:
1. Bitcoin has open source code and is open to all users. Some are criminals from the Silk Road, now there are criminals from Wall Street getting involved as well. Bitcoin welcomes all comers and this is a feature, not a problem.
2. Wall Street crooks are more dangerous than drug dealers, but they also bring an illusion of legitimacy that Bitcoin can certainly use at this stage.
3. Since Bitcoin itself is open source and based on consensus bankers like Masters cannot do as much damage as you might fear they could. We can always cut them out of the loop via innovation.
4. Selfish motivation: for Bitcoin to be a really worthwhile derivative instrument we'd need to see the price go up about 1000x. That would make many of us here millionaires, so self interest prevents complaints.

No, I doubt there will be multi tiered pricing. But the cash only businesses now have an electronic payment option without the fees of the card networks. 
This is important because the more market share Bitcoin takes the more competitive the credit card companies will have to be with their fees which will lower prices across the board.
It's true that Bitcoin remains on the fringes for the moment, but these use cases will help change that.

This is some stupid fucking bullshit on every level.
As many have pointed, 1 BTC =/= $1000 in 2016, so I won't revisit that.
More importantly, the exchange rate has never at any point been $1 to 1k BTC.  The Bitcoin pizza trade was 10k BTC for about $40 worth of pizza, so the lowest exchange rate in Bitcoin history was not 1 BTC to $0.001, but 1 BTC to $0.004.

Krugman went on record as claiming the internet was niche technology as late as 1996. He is anything but a visionary when it comes to technology.
Also as another pointed out, Krugman only complained that Bitcoin is deflationary. If that's such a problem we could have a pegged sidechain with an adjustable rate of inflation. With that simple addition his sole point becomes moot.

Arvind Narayanan is not thinking very clearly on the topic of automating car titles. 
Let's imagine the car title side chain. On it are the titles of all registered automobiles. But every single car title wallet is multisig. To transfer ownership there must be the signature of the seller, but also that of the sales tax collector, with perhaps the registration authority mining the transaction. Until sales tax is paid that signature is not added and the car doesn't change ownership. 
Of course those taxes could be paid in the form of CarCoin transaction fees, and the registration fees would go to securing the CarCoin network, but what's wrong with that?
If anything blockchain based registration could help enforce rules rather than cut out the current structure as he seems to fear.

I can restate each of your four arguments as one: it's this way now so nothing will change. 
Bearer assets have slowly been falling out of favor for several reasons, but one of the most important is the difficulty of securing them, so that's the meat of your points both against bearer instruments and Bitcoin security. 
But Bitcoin security is improving all the time. Is it ready for primetime? 
Not yet, clearly. 
But as more services with intuitive multisig and escrow arise the tide will continue to shift in favor of ironclad and easy to implement security. This will likely change the security equation in favor of Bitcoin, especially since there are already services that will assume risk (and provide insurance) in return for fees smaller than most banks charge today.
When it comes to credit card rewards and cash pricing I have to say I often do business with multiple entities that do offer multi tiered pricing to discourage credit card use in favor of cash, in fact on a daily basis. The fact you would call it rare is quite confusing to me.
If we see another meteoric rise or two in Bitcoin price we would also very likely see more merchants willing to offer a discount in order to acquire bitcoins. As the price stagnates so does the impetus to offer rewards. This can change over night.
Whether it will be success or failure for Bitcoin specifically remains murky, but old paradigms are being challenged and most will fall. Whether at the hands of Bitcoin or some other digitized payment system remains to be seen.
@_date: 2015-03-01 03:45:09
The US government has been absolutely clear that they don't consider Bitcoin a ponzi. Ponzi schemes don't offer anything, but Bitcoin owners can possess their own private keys.  The idea that an asset grows in value as new people invest thereby increasing the wealth of earlier investors is miles away from the actual definition of a ponzi, yet is the only similarity you've offered, makes you seem either willfully ignorant or intentionally misleading. Whichever of those it is you deserve any ridicule you receive. But let's set one other thing straight. You said:


Huge swing and a miss, Bernie Madoff stole over $18 billion. It's $65 billion if you count the loss of the fabricated gains. 
Since the max Bitcoin market cap was $14 billion and that would represent fabricated gains rather than real losses Madoff's ponzi was at a minimum 5x worse than Bitcoin would be if it were a ponzi, which it obviously isn't by any but your decidedly simple-minded definitions.

No attempt at obfuscation on my end, you're comparing Bitcoin to a scam and your analogy is laughable. Bitcoin still may fail. I'll even go on the record as saying failure remains more likely than success.
Nevertheless, you're the one who is once again being disingenuous. Bitcoin may fail, but you refuse to engage in honest conversations or to acknowledge that there is even a chance of success.
I clearly put the chances of success higher than you do, but to pretend they're zero is idiotic. I am glad the price dropped: if it hadn't it would have been unwise (because of the unignorable possibility of failure) of me to put in enough money to hit my previous ownership goals. Since the price fell I was able to hit the number of BTC I wanted without exceeding my risk tolerance. That's not just a "cheap coinz" meme, that's a calculated risk made with full knowledge of my own finances, risk profile, and conventional retirement plans, none of which you know on any level.

But you're going on an implication of free will while the Bible states clearly that we are chosen by God for either salvation or damnation.
Read Romans chapter 9, Paul is unequivocal in his statements that God chooses who shall be saved and who shall be damned.
I once argued in favor of free will myself. Until I learned Greek and read this chapter. Free will is nowhere in scripture, God chooses to torture the vast majority (broad is the way that leads to destruction, after all) merely to show the few he *has* chosen what he could have done to them if he felt like it according to Paul in this chapter. It can't get plainer than that: free will is a modern invention.

There obviously can be no certainty when it comes to this, but the most likely explanation given human nature is that he doesn't want to sabotage his greatest achievement. I'd rather be remembered as one of the greatest people of all time (which is on the table if Bitcoin becomes central to world finance, unlikely but not impossible) than merely be another anonymous rich guy. Most people would make that choice, why wouldn't he? And if he's already rich or sold a few thousand coins that couldn't be linked to him he gets to have his cake and eat it too if Bitcoin goes primetime. So the real question is why would we expect him to move his coins?

The Bitcoin ecosystem is still growing constantly.
There haven't been any fatal flaws found in the protocol.

The open source nature of Bitcoin matches my political ideals such that it isn't a moral stretch for me to support it
I am a poor trader, so if I'm going to be involved it would be foolish of me to try to increase my holdings through trading, so holding is a less stressful and lower risk method of retaining exposure to bitcoins.
Failure is highly possible but since I've been careful only to purchase what I can afford to lose the upside is huge should Bitcoin succeed but the downside remains mostly negligible in case of sudden failure.
If the chances of failure increase dramatically I'll reevaluate at that point.
Current troubles that worry me: shrinking merchant adoption, low interest from average people, the possibility of being relegated to the dark net and never going mainstream, government interference, and least yet worth mentioning scalability and a possible hard fork to solve it.

This makes it seem like you didn't read the whole chapter, because this is the opening while Paul continues and used this section to make a pont. Paul discusses the election of the Hebrews as an analogy for the election of those to whom he'll grant salvation, the point is they didn't deserve it but God chose them for mercy. Meanwhile Pharaoh didn't deserve his doom, but God hardened his heart because God had chosen him for destruction.


Implications are worthless when the opposite is flatly stated. Especially stated multiple times, as you admit here.


Easy, to give himself an excuse when he tortures us for eternity, just like he gave Pharaoh the illusion of a choice but didn't allow him to choose the option where he doesn't get punished. If God is unchanging across infinite time why should it surprise you that he hasn't decided now to give people a choice before punishing them if he expressly states that he didn't do it before?

No. 2000 years ago the Romans were using concrete that hardened under water, building aqueducts that transported fresh water hundreds of miles at a precise gradient to the city and were built so well that some remain in use to this day, and were erecting a stadium capable of holding 70,000 people under a retractable roof a few miles from their open air stadium that held 250,000 people.

So we might as well trash the whole thing as suspicious by that logic. We may as well ignore it completely and merely attempt to approach the divine on our own terms. Sounding a lot like Gnosticism now. The early church would have executed you for that.


The New Testament was written entirely in Greek. Greek is most certainly the original for the whole New Testament.

Sidechains would not replace Bitcoin but would allow for more application specific use. If we put asset registry on the blockchain it would make more sense to have a sidechain for car registration but a different one for mineral rights, for instance. That way there's less information to store and search if you only need to find out who owns the mineral rights for a particular piece of land in order to try to purchase those rights. Sidechains don't provide an alternative to Bitcoin, they provide a way to keep the Bitcoin blockchain organized and reduce bloating effects.

The metric I'm using to judge that the stock market rise is unsustainable is that the stock market has risen since 2008 in exact proportion to QE, which indicates that there is a reasonable probability that the gains are being made based on loose monetary supply rather than strong fundamentals, an idea strongly supported by the fact that unemployment is high and huge numbers of unemployed people aren't even being counted in those numbers because they've dropped out of the workforce by ceasing to even look for a job.  Of the numbers of "jobs created" that we see on the news most are already employed people who have taken on second jobs because the economy is so rough.  These are not signs of sustainable growth.
The probability that a crash will happen at some point in the future is 100%.  There is no way that we are going to go 500 years without another crash.  The likelihood that there'll be another within 50 years is fairly high.  As long as Dodd-Frank and the bail-ins it provides stand it doesn't matter whether that crash is next year or next century, unless the FDIC gets drastically reformed it won't have enough to cover a major financial catastrophe on the order of 2008 if the recovery is funded by bail-ins rather than money printing.

You're wrong, but there is still a valid point in there.  [As this chart shows,]( the "gold bubble" popped after 1980.  Similarly when the real estate bubble and the .com bubbles popped many of the goods lost value without going entirely to zero.  Gold has done the same thing, and will again.  If BTC can lose significant value (the bubble pops) without going all the way to zero or being discarded as a currency, it will end up fine, just like gold, real estate, and certain tech stocks.  The danger is that bitcoin could pop so violently that it loses more ground than it has gained in recent months.  As long as it doesn't disappear it can afford to pop, just like gold has.

Bitcoin is not going to kill gold.  If anything Bitcoin will strengthen interest in gold among people who before were satisfied with dollars.  Gold offers something bitcoin doesn't: a physical artifact.  Much like CDs killed cassettes, but not vinyl.  Why not?

As a word in a vacuum, perhaps it is about as random.  As a word thought up by a human in the context of attempting to generate random words, it is not random in the least.  And I can promise you that *everyone* trying to come up with random phrases has the word "random" pop into their mind.  I know this partially because literally any time I try to think of random words I think of the word "random," along with related terms such as "disorder" and "chaos."  
This still wouldn't be a problem, except if someone is writing a program to rob brain wallets they would not be above including instructions to add such words and their obvious derivatives (like r4nd0m, or rAnDoM) at meaningless points throughout a phrase since a human mind is highly likely to think of them while trying (and, as you have done, failing miserably) to be random.

No.  Right now 1 BTC is worth $200.  This means one satoshi, the currently smallest portion of BTC is worth 0.0002 cents.  That is, in essence, nothing.  As the price of a single coin rises the price of the smallest unit rises, until it becomes non-negligible.  When the smallest unit becomes worth a reasonable amount a new smallest piece can come into use, and on from there.  Smaller fractions are only introduced when they are scarce enough to be worth considering, therefore your concern won't come into play since there will be scarcity if smaller fractions become necessary.

Yea, Communism as an ideology is anarchistic, Communism as a system is authoritarian.  In practice Communism cannot ever be an anarchist system, but that is the deeply flawed ideal behind the system that must in practice fail.
But that's the issue here, I read gox as discussing the ideal of Communism, which indeed is anarchistic.  Meanwhile what you're contradicting him with is how Communism must work when put into practice.  They are two different points, and they are both accurate until you say that gox is wrong in claiming the ideology of Communism is anarchistic.  After all, he acknowledges that using an authoritarian system to bring about an anarchy is a terrible idea, so I think he and I both understand your points about the state never relinquishing but always seeking to increase its power.

The Namecoin network is far behind the Bitcoin network in terms of infrastructure, ease of use, and general development.  Yes, there are numerous squatters.  In fact I have a couple hundred .bit domains myself.  The good news is that at the current level of development:
A.  The squatted domains are super cheap.  You can buy them for very little.  I would sell any of mine for a bitcent or so.  At that price squatting deters people from registering a name just to post a site for pornography or trolling, but allows for people who have real uses to buy for a negligible amount.
B.  Even with the number of squatters there are still numerous domains available.  Just download Namecoin-qt and get started.
C.  Through Namecoin-qt and various registration websites it is easy to contact squatters and trade names for coins.  The network may or may not succeed, which means there is a strong incentive to sell domains currently registered if an offer comes through, because there may never be another offer.

You are probably right.  0.1 BTC buys 40 shares though, and I have it to spare.  Considering what happened to ASICMiner I think it's worth some level of risk.  If I had 40 shares of ASICMiner right now I'd be pretty pumped, and it's not hard to sell incrementally to lock in profits even if it is just going to be pumped and dumped.  In fact, the 0.1 BTC I am probably going to put towards AMC is profit from buying LTC and PPC low and selling at marginally higher rates during various BTC-e pump and dumps, so might as well throw my gambling winnings at another lottery ticket.

And like every other human quality it appears in different measures in different individuals.

No, those are properties inherent in the Bitcoin protocol.  Transactions are still often processed without a transaction fee, so it is untrue to claim that they derive value from transaction fees.  
Even if Bitcoin is not used for money at all in the future it is entirely possible that an individual bitcoin will still hold a massive value based on the properties inherent in the protocol, specifically the blockchain.  Bitcoins may be convertible to fiat because of what you can do with them, not because of what you can buy with them.

This statement is horribly flawed.  First, governments are the ones who point guns at people, who commit genocide, who jail people and ruin their lives over a joint roach in their ashtray.  All the corporations in the history of earth do not combine to do a quarter of the damage perpetrated by governments.  It isn't even close.  It wasn't a corporation that slaughtered the native Americans in the 1800s, or the Jews in the Holocaust, or the millions killed by Pol Pot, Stalin, or Mao.  Those were all governments.
You may retort with the British East Indies Company, which indeed did horrible things in India.  Such a retort, however, only strengthens my point.  Corporations, like the British East Indies Company, are entities that, with *government* endorsement shift liability away from the owners of the corporation and onto the corporate entity.  Without governments giving their approval by means of legally limiting liability corporations would be unable to do such massive amounts of damage because their owners could be held directly liable for the actions they initiate.  Suddenly business entities would have to be held accountable for their actions without the governments of the world protecting the bad actors, who in every case have donated mountains of cash to the people who make up the government.  You can't blame corporations without blaming the power that allows them to function in bad faith and avoid the consequences for their actions.

Adoption fuels development and development fuels adoption.  The more people use BTC the more it will be developed.  The more it is developed the more people will use it.  Not all of us have the skills and resources to help in the programming and venture capital fields, but we can all try to increase the market size, which will provide an incentive for the programmers and venture capitalists.
It's a feedback loop that promotes and self-limits simultaneously.  Remember: the development side is progressing, but as long as the technology remains in nascent stages the growth will be limited by the current state of the tools.  This means BTC will not grow too quickly because the technology is not yet at a point where it is attractive to the average user.  When we spread the word we increase the market among people who are ready to use it in its current state.  This promotes development which will bring the technology to the next level so it is accessible to less advanced users and so that it becomes more scalable as necessary.

Since no one wants this scenario to happen there would be numerous options.  Either we would form a collective that only defends against force but no longer exercises it against drug users, tax dodgers, and other non-violent criminals; or maybe we would pay a private company instead of paying taxes that go to police; and obviously there would be no one telling you that you couldn't carry a concealed firearm, so there's no benefit in attacking someone if literally anyone *could* be armed.  If the social institution of the state arose to prevent such scenarios then without a state we'd either find a more efficient way to do the same thing or bring back the state.

If you admit that not everyone has an equal sense of humor then it's pretty clear that fundamentalists of every stripe have inferior senses of humor to non-fundamentalists.  In general, the members of the Westboro Baptist Church clearly have very little sense of humor.
The guys who killed Theo Van Gogh do not have good senses of humor.  If they did, they'd react with humor rather than violence.  The ones who [attacked this guy]( also lack a sense of humor.  I mean seriously, just google Muslim cartoon attack and you'll see numerous examples of fundies with no sense of humor, and who have proved their lack of a sense of humor by responding with violence instead of humor.   
The mullahs who issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie lack a developed sense of humor.  If they had a sense of humor they'd lampoon him instead of threaten him with death.
The 9/11 hijackers lacked a sense of humor.  If they had a good sense of humor they would have used their wits to try to persuade people over the course of their long lives to see the injustice of US policies, but instead they proved they lacked a sense of humor and proved that their lives were worth more to their aims in dying than in living and winning people over.  These are not the behaviors of people with a decent sense of humor.
I don't give half a shit if Tim McVeigh claimed that keeping your sense of humor is important, if he lived by that ethos he would have tried to persuade people rather than blow them up.  Anyone who looks to violence over humor is, by definition, someone who lacks humor.  You're arguing an absolutely unwinnable point.

I can also show you places where people dump their garbage even though a government sponsored dump site is less than 1.5 miles distant.  I used to drive by daily and see the trash sitting there when whoever left it could have driven literally 90 seconds further down the road and dropped off the same trash legally and without littering.  The place where they dumped trash, however, was also publicly owned.  This is a tragedy of the commons issue, I would imagine.  Do the studies you're citing take that factor into account?


In the city where I live right now the mayor lost his re-election bid by the narrowest of margins.  Was it because he was going to reduce the number of lanes on a road that already sees more traffic than it can handle?  How about because he helped champion a new power station that will cause the utilities bills of every resident to rise permanently (contrary to what one would think, they were not projecting there to eventually be a drop in prices after the station was paid for)?  Maybe because he created a position for an executive assistant for himself and made the salary for that position more than $50,000/year?  Nope, none of the above.

Under a truly Libertarian system there would be no corporations.  
Corporations are legal entities that deflect accountability from the owners of a venture and limit liability so that it applies only to the legal entity and not to the people who make the decisions and profit from them.  One of the main focuses of Libertarianism is reducing the functions of the government, and one of the best ways to do that is remove the corporate privilege and hold the owners of companies directly responsible.  This would force the owners of those companies to direct their behavior responsibly lest their own personal fortunes be tapped to pay for the damages caused by their actions.  Suddenly they would have to act responsibly or be held responsible in court, and there would consequently be no need for so many regulatory agencies.

Which introduces and element of trust and is contrary to the very spirit of Bitcoin.  Plus, you first have to have a conventional payment system in place, which means at the very least BTC is as difficult to acquire as a product, and thereby *more* difficult to acquire than any common form of payment.  
You aren't really understanding what people mean by difficult, are you?    Yea, you can buy BTC from someone online, but I don't have to buy dollars online.  BTC adds a level of risk and a level of difficulty in its acquisition that is beyond that of any regular means of payment.  Only when it becomes as easy to use as Paypal or a credit card without sacrificing security will we see widespread adoption.

I agree with your hoarding point, but bitcoins are much more difficult to obtain than pretty much any other payment device.  What other than difficult *relative* to cash, credit, debit, or paypal would anyone mean when they say BTC is hard to obtain?
Bitcoin is not easier to acquire than a paypal account, except if you count entering your name, address, and account number as more difficult than understanding change addresses, public keys, private keys, how to create wallets, how to secure a system, address sweeps, and the basics of cryptography.  And if you are smart enough to understand all that (and I would recommend against BTC for anyone who didn't have a basic grasp of all those points) surely typing your pertinent details into paypal wouldn't somehow be a greater challenge.  
We don't have to exaggerate: bitcoin is without question more difficult to acquire than conventional money devices.  You say it is only hard for the lazy, but those same lazy people use cash, credit cards, and checking accounts without complaint or thinking very hard.  BTC isn't *excessively* difficult, but it definitely requires more determination to acquire than most money systems, unless you're one of the few people who gets paid in BTC.
Think about it: it's as difficult to set up a coinbase account as a paypal account, but there is an additional waiting period of nearly a week with coinbase if everything goes well and they haven't reached their rolling limit.  Dwolla is harder than paypal to set up, and it's just the first step to being able to buy on an exchange.  Or you can use bitpay, if you want an exorbitant fee and to have to deal with retail clerks who (in my experience) have been pretty inept at handling your bitpay transaction.
All of this, and you first need to have cash or a checking account to purchase BTC, so it isn't like you can at any point circumvent the difficulties and risks involved in setting up or acquiring one of those vehicles of exchange.  
So yes, Bitcoin is without any reasonable doubt more difficult to acquire than other payment systems.  It is easier to use than many other systems (if the counterparty accepts it) but relative to any other widely used payment system it is certainly much more difficult to obtain.

Ask for 90% U.S. coinage.  If you know what a quarter or a dime looks like you're already good to go.  Through 1964 every coin above a nickel (which is made of nickel and copper) was made of 90% silver.  [Here is a website]( that will tell you up-to-date values of pre-1965 U.S. coins.  Then you can sell him a bitcoin for about 7 oz. of silver and say you sold 1BTC for $10 and watch everyone on here froth at the mouth.

The only thing I want changed is this: there is no longer to be permitted the initiation of force.  Not for individuals, and not for governments.  
Defense against those who initiate force will always be permitted.  To rape, murder, rob, assault, or anything similar requires an initiation of force, so consequently force may be used in response against people who do such things.
It is not, however, permissible to use force against people who merely make choices for themselves.  Those choices could be to engage in sex acts that seem disgusting but occur between mutually consenting adults, or to use drugs of some sort, or to refuse to pay taxes.  THese acts are not coercive, and therefore do not merit the initiation of force against those who commit them.
If we were to remove the authority of the state to initiate force I would be satisfied, at least temporarily.

You seem to be rambling, and I don't understand what point you are attempting to make.  Horse drawn carriages are obsolete technology, but the more we learn about the physical world the more we discover how we can use elements and chemicals before considered useless.  As technology advances, therefore, elements do not become obsolete as old technologies do, they only become more useful over time.  For this reason your carriage analogy seems facile and lacking in basic understanding of the arrow of progress.
I also don't understand what nano bots have to do with the value of gold for its intrinsic properties.  In fact, because of its ductility and resistance to corrosion I can think of few applications that might have more use for small amounts of gold than the nano bots you mention.  If gold became more of an industrial metal than a mere store of value it would drive demand and price up, not down.

The rest of your problems may be solved by a new cryptocurrency, but there are more brilliant people working on fixes for BTC than working on new coins.  It's all about adoption, and since so many of the code writers have already adopted Bitcoin and are working towards improving it there may not be a sea change like you expect.

The domains I picked up fit into one of two categories: either business names or names which I have plans for personally.  If I have plans for the names myself it is completely in line with the point of the Namecoin network.  
On the other hand, the business names I have bought also provide a useful service for the businesses.  Someone else may purchase the name to set up an offensive site of some sort in hopes for massive profits when the business seeks to remove the offensive association.  This is tantamount to extortion.  Meanwhile I am merely occupying the space so that if those businesses ever decide they want to expand into the Namecoin space they can do so at a tiny premium without worrying about offensive material tied to their brand.
Therefore it seems to me that I am providing a useful service that at most will turn a very small profit while allowing businesses to keep their brand image clean and begin to utilize the Namecoin space for only a few dollars instead of hundreds or thousands.


I don't see the use that americanairlines.bit would have for any normal user.  The only reason *anyone* other than American Airlines would register that name is to squat on it.

Meanwhile there is no harm for the network because the worst you can claim against me is that I'm squatting  on names and preventing more aggressive squatters and trolls from acquiring the same names.
Can you justify your position given that I am not actively harming the companies involved but instead giving them an opportunity to pick up the .bit version of their names at a very cheap rate and am not posting offensive information to extort a higher price?

Furthermore, I guess you haven't been paying attention to the bloodshed still ongoing in Chechnya.

I can see your point, even though most of my ideologies are somewhat represented on the sidebar.  
It is good for Libertarianism to get more people involved in Bitcoin.  If we can get them to BTC they might start asking which other aspects of our society are being screwed over by the old-boys network.  If we tell everyone from the start that BTC is Libertarian, however, we might hurt the possibility of increased adoption.
In short, though I am rather radical politically I would rather use Bitcoin to get others to come to my point of view over a long time scale than risk the success of Bitcoin by telling everyone it's tied up with Libertarianism from the beginning.

Tapering from $85B to $75B is not impressive, and if they see poor results there's every reason to think they'll ramp it up beyond the original $85B in response to the emerging situation.  Saying that QE will be over by the end of 2014 is extremely optimistic, nearly to the point of naiveté.  Furthermore, the money that has been printed in QE has not hit the market and remains sitting in the vaults of the banks that benefitted from the policy.  If a dramatic event forces those banks to release their cash reserves we will see dramatic inflation nearly overnight.

I didn't say people would spend more.  But you might have a smartphone into which you would swap several different storage devices instead of having one hard-wired in, or several different cameras based on whether you want to shoot high resolution stills or top quality video, maybe RAM and graphics quality extensions for gaming swapped out at a second's notice for fiber-optic speed level internet connectors, or motion sensors for better hands free use that you can switch out for any other device.  Or any combination of the above.  People may end up spending nearly as much, and be able to get devices that better suit their needs.  They may turn to upgrading individual parts rather than throwing away the whole platform.  Before you'd have to get one phone that does everything somewhat well, but with a modular design you can have one device and dynamically adjust capabilities moment by moment based on need.

They can, but at a slightly higher production cost, and there is little incentive to do so since the existing companies have some degree of collusion in producing goods at the current durability and price levels.  This means a new company attempting to put out a better product that costs more to make cannot gain a foothold against more established competitors with production costs that are lower both because they are producing intentionally inferior goods and because they already have their production, marketing, transportation, regulation compliance, etc. mechanisms in place and amortized into their models.

Because liability limitations are either government granted by default or written into a contract, but if they are written into a contract all parties have agreed in advance, while this isn't so with government granted limitations.


Slavery is still ongoing, even in the USA.  Please look into human trafficking if you didn't already know this.  The reason why slavery is no longer openly practiced is a shift in social norms that would be operable with or without a government to enforce those norms.  The government didn't decide to stop slavery then it happened, people began finding it distasteful and the government reacted to this shift in public opinion by doing the only thing a government really can: resorting to force.  Shifting opinions continue to shift, slavery would have moved into the shadows whether the government forced the issue or not.


Your economy is useless if no one is buying your goods.  There was already a move away from slavery-produced goods in Europe, if the Northern states had followed suit the South would have quickly found it in their economic best interest to relinquish slavery without a shot fired.


Yes, tariffs include government involvement, which is a realistic scenario due to the fact that the USA had a government at the time.  You are correct that this is not my ideal.  Ideally enough individuals would have boycotted unethically produced merchandise that it would have become unprofitable to use those methods of production.  The larger point that you should realize is that though non-violence and tariffs were open as possibilities for the government of the day they instead resorted to the more brutal solution of exercising force.  My larger point is that this simple, yet horrific, solution is the one governments most often choose though it is usually not the best one.


Obviously not per day, but if you go back to Vietnam the Vietnamese government claims [500,000 birth defects and 400,000 deaths due to US action]( and according to *Lancet*, which is not exactly a lightweight source there have been [over 600,000]( violent deaths in Iraq in the period between 2003-2006.  SO I don't think millions is much of an exaggeration at all.


Yes, I did wonder that, and then I discovered it was because of the petrodollar.  I am quite familiar with *realpolitik* and the fact that international politics are quite complex, but I also don't appreciate not having a choice whether my tax dollars are being used to murder people around the world.
This cheap oil point is also important because inherently conservative power structures like governments and the corporations they foster stifle innovation.  Oil is so necessary because other technologies are not pursued as aggressively as they would be without those conservative influences.  Even barring the introduction of LIFTR technology or something like that which has been stifled rather than encouraged oil itself could be more easily supplied without intervention from malicious actors, and that intervention nearly always uses the infrastructure of government coercion to achieve its ends.

I disagree with your idea that the services that government provides are somehow irreplaceable.  Any of the actions you mentioned count as aggression, so there are options beyond the communal militia option you mention or the government option we're using now to defend against those acts.  People make up the government, if people are currently doing these things then people would continue to do so even without the authority to initiate force has been taken away and only the right to defend against force remains.

Real world economic output based on creating the cheapest, shittiest products imaginable: yes.  Economic output capable of convincing people to spend a deflationary currency today because the product they're getting will last a long time and remain worthwhile for years to come: no.  
The counter example is technology, in which the new products are better than old ones and people will continue to want upgrades on a regular basis.  But even that can fit the deflationary model if the tech products sold are made increasingly modular and new cameras, info storage, internet connectors, and so forth could be easily switched into and out of an existing platform and only upgraded when truly superior products come to market rather than entirely upgraded annually when only one part has truly progressed and the rest are only marginally superior.

Less incentive to spend is not necessarily a bad thing.  I have been wondering recently if our abundance of cheaply made goods which are designed to fail within a predetermined amount of time (specifically about 6 months after the longest available warranty expires) might disappear under a more deflationary currency.  You would put off buying a new refrigerator as long as possible, but when you did purchase one it would be a model that would last for decades and be easily repaired if anything did go wrong.  Sure, fewer fridges would be sold, but the added craftsmanship means they would go at relatively higher prices than the ones we currently have.
This could apply to automobiles, as well.  The systems in current generation cars contain circuits designed to burn out within 7 years or so.  Same for televisions, computers, and pretty much everything else.  Might our inflationary currency have something to do with our cheaply made goods?  Might as well buy a new phone today, the money isn't going to be able to buy you a slightly nicer one tomorrow.  The incentive to spend *now* with a deflationary currency would only come alongside goods more able to retain high value over time, things worth buying today rather than waiting for the money to appreciate in value before purchasing later.

*Nothing* has value if there are no conscious agents, that much is true.  But since the discussion is between two different types of value and value can only exist if there are conscious agents to recognize it then your point is moot because the nature of the question assumes the existence of the conscious agents.
Therefore, since the very question of intrinsic vs. extrinsic value assumes that there are conscious agents I define them as follows: Intrinsic value is value that would exist even if there was only one agent.  Food would have value even if there were only one man on earth.  So would potable water, easy to use building supplies, warm furs, and dry timber.  These things derive their value from their nature.  Gold, on the other hand, would have no value if there were a population of only 1, or even only 500.  Extrinsic value is that which arises from mutual agreement of conscious agents rather than by features that are required for the sustenance of life.  Gold has no intrinsic value, as Schiff claims it does.  Gold only has value as a medium of exchange, which is an extrinsic feature applied by mutual agreement.

I am aware of the uses for gold, but they do not even come close to providing a valid reason for the current cost.  Silver does many of the same things as gold, but better.  Silver is a better conductor, tarnishes only with exposure to sulphur compounds, and is naturally anti-microbial.  Yet with properties that are generally superior to those of gold, silver stands at around $20/oz while gold is closer to $1250/oz.  In some applications silver and gold are equal, in others silver can be superior to gold, so the cause for the price difference is gold's history as money more than gold's superiority in fabricating devices.

If this level of understanding is what it requires to be published as an economic analyst it bodes ill for the field as a whole.
The single worst bit for me was this:


The price of the dollar relative to other currencies does change moment to moment, yet no one bothers to change the prices in the grocery store every few seconds.  If BTC were the primary currency it would be the same way.  
You wouldn't go to an ATM in a BTC economy because there would be no cash.  The idea that there would be a cash shortage in a BTC economy is like bewailing the horse shortage in the world of automobiles.  Sure, there are no horses, and no one misses them when they're driving down the interstate any more than someone would miss cash if BTC were king.
So in short, the first part of the paragraph is inaccurate and completely neglects the facts of shifting foreign exchange rates with which an "internationally recognized analyst" should be familiar and the end of the paragraph betrays the author's all-encompassing ignorance of what Bitcoin is at its core.

What I said is fairly clear.  With or without government some level of slavery will exist, and with or without government it would have been pushed into the shadows by social norms.  If it would be pushed into the shadows without such a violent war, why have the war?


I never claimed there was a conspiracy in some kind of cartoonish "Illuminati" sense, but if you think the oil companies aren't some of the ones lobbying against expanded nuclear energy and some of the ones spreading the NIMBY bullshit you're sadly mistaken.
Now, on to your comment that:




I advocate a system in which the only rule is that it's never ok to initiate force.  The government functions because it is the entity that reserves the right to initiate force against whomever it pleases.  I believe that many social institutions to prevent the kind of hellscape you describe would arise even if there was no longer any initiation of force permitted.  The difference between my ideal society and the current one is not that in my society there are roving bands of slavers, but that we have the option to truly and voluntarily sign the social contract under which we live.  I didn't sign the social contract that says it's ok to use my money to bomb people in Yemen for cheap gas, and I wouldn't sign it given the option.

Cool.  I am open to changing my outlook, but I need good evidence.  The mintage numbers make me inclined to think that gold may have been more common than most people who had lived through the Depression (a perception-altering event if ever there was one) would have remembered.  
As an example of that effect I tried to talk to my mother about when they took silver out of the US coins in 1965.

I have been reading this and mostly agreed with you, but now you're using "Hollywood definitions" to re-use your own term.  The idea behind Marx's original Communism was indeed a completely stateless society, as gox stated.  The idea is that if you set up a true Communist society then before long you could remove the coercion because everyone would love living in the workers' paradise and no longer need to be forced into doing it.  Of course this is entirely incorrect, but it is the central idea behind Communism.  Communism is based on several false premises and gross misunderstandings of human nature, but it is certainly a failed attempt at a stateless utopia.

Also, I see no problem with fragmenting when a significant portion of the population, which is already regionally separate, desires to end the association that had previously existed.  If people no longer want to be part of a group it is immoral to make them remain a part of that group.  When some want to leave because the rest will not tolerate their bad behavior (for instance, owning slaves) the right move is to let them go, because one is better off allowing the immoral minority to depart from the moral majority than to try to force them to do the right thing, especially given the option to just let them leave.
In addition, both the North and the South after parting ways remain larger and possessing more natural resources than any European nation save Russia.  It would not have been onerous for the two nations to coexist and pursue their separate aims.
While boycotts have not worked to stop nearly all unethically produced goods part of that failure is a lack of information and the other part is a lack of will.  The North and Europe lacked neither one of those things (as proven by the willingness of the North to go to war and their willingness to help slaves escape prior to the war) so it seems to me that boycotts would be more effective against the South than they have been against Chick-Fil-A.

I think what you mean is more like: "*Why* will Bitcoin make me rich?  Why is it a good investment?"
The answers to those questions are myriad.  Most simply Bitcoin is looking more and more everyday as if it is the future of value transfer.  If Bitcoin provides the infrastructure for the global financial system it will grow astronomically in value.  That is the shortest possible answer about why it would be a good investment or make you rich.
If you want to know why Bitcoin would make a good foundational infrastructure for the global financial system you should reformulate your questions to specifically address what you need to know for those queries.

First: non-wealthy people typically do not build factories. 
Second: the types of pursuits that involve more money than people have lying around are already funded by venture capital and leveraged financing, so there would be no difference.
Third: without limiting liability by means of shunting it off to corporations there would be more detailed limits to liability written into contracts from the beginning of interactions and there would be more insurance options for liability not governed by contracts, similar to the malpractice insurance most doctors have today.  Yes, it would increase the cost of doing business slightly, but the regulatory costs required would drop dramatically since gross negligence would not be insured and would therefore come out of the pockets of the responsible parties.  
I think that the drop in cost of business from lower taxes and lower cost of regulatory compliance would probably also outweigh the increased insurance costs.

No, by modern standards plantations were not corporations because there was no separate legal entity.  If in 1840 I had a claim against a plantation I could take everything from the plantation owner in a court battle.  Now if there is a claim against J.P. Morgan Chase Jamie Dimon's personal fortune is secure.  That is a world of difference.
The government endorsed slavery, until it didn't.  Are you really going to try to argue that government is the answer based on how the 1800s played out?  That is laughable if so.  Slavery is abominable, but having a war in which so many multitudes of people die, the former slaves are thrust into a state of "freedom" in which they still lack any rights or personal agency, they face simmering resentment from the Southern population for more than a century, and the formerly productive Southern USA is ravaged in such a way that for over half a century it doesn't recover, yet you're claiming government had a good solution to the problem?  
Please tell me you realize the Civil War was not the best course of action.  If the North had allowed the South to secede and then levied trade tariffs on slave-harvested agricultural products slavery would have disappeared within a decade without the deaths and resentment, and it's entirely possible the two halves would have reunited on good terms.  And that's but one possible option that would have been superior to a war that tore us apart then shoved us back together again, still hating each other to the present day.
Also, the government of the United States still is killing millions.  Do you think it's somehow morally superior to kill people in the Middle East rather than on land closer to home?  And why exactly are my tax dollars being used to murder people on the Arabian peninsula?  I still don't really understand that one, especially when we kill Al Qaeda in Yemen but fund them in Syria.  That simply doesn't compute.  I bet I could find a better use for my money than that.

My god, I can't remember many less-informed and devoid of substance replies than the one you've just produced.


First off, naming logical fallacies doesn't make them present.  Also, the term you were searching for is "non sequitur," not "sequitor."  Furthermore, show me a single non sequitur or instance of special pleading in my comment.  You should stop throwing around inapplicable terms to seem intelligent, some of us actually know what they mean.
Next: name one major player?  [How about China?](  The Chinese have been [very noisy]( about removing the world reserve status from the dollar.  And it isn't just China.  The five largest emerging economies (BRICS) are [starting their own currency pool.](  That's Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.  And it isn't just them.  As far back as 2007 the OPEC nations have been [considering a move away from the dollar.]( 
So name one?  How about ten: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Oman.  That's a pretty dangerous combo.
Do you think those nations are going to openly state ahead of time on what date they are going to drop the dollar?  If that's what you mean by definitive plans, I have some news for you.  They still hold dollars, even though they are moving away from USD as quickly as possible.  They won't discuss dropping the dollar in definitive terms until they have already done it, because to do so sooner will devalue their remaining holdings.  Please tell me you're able to recognize such obvious facts.

Instead they seem to go up in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

2.  These thefts highlight advice that appears constantly here: do not leave your money in an exchange.  Always withdraw to your private wallet when purchases complete.

Those bars were not sold in assay cards.  Assay cards can be counterfeited, but it adds another unnecessary layer of difficulty.  Counterfeiting is accomplished by coating tungsten in gold so that the gold passes acid tests and seems genuine until you drill into the core.  There is a much slimmer profit margin in coating one ounce bars in tungsten since a much higher percentage of the bar needs to be gold than with a large bar, and they are more likely to be considered suspicious if they are sold outside of the assay card, while large bars are not sealed in an assay and therefore lack that extra level of difficulty to counterfeit.  These small bars are not as worthwhile to counterfeit, and even if it were counterfeit most dealers would not bother to open the assay card to test, so even if it is counterfeit it likely would sell as easily and safely as if it were real.
