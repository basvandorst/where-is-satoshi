Not surprising. It's the only other medium of exchange token and it's a lot better tech wise than Bitcoin.

Except for the fact that the market cap is almost 80 billion larger and therefore requires way more capital to consolidate at these levels.

I'll wait till the sale in 2 months.

"WAY WAY more volume and liquidity in the stock market though" 
You just admitted that they are not comparable with that statement.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:31:59
We are delusional, apparently. The faster the bubble, the harder the crash.
edit: I should reiterate - this run is unprecedented versus any other bubble in history, but I think $14k is the magic number. If 14k falls I would expect consolidation around 10k before choosing a direction.

"Delusional point of view" - FTFY
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:25:02
If 14k falls, technical trades will see this as an opportunity to short and all momentum trades will likely get scared. Not to mention all the people that bought in 15k-19k range will already be down 1-5k/BTC in just a matter of hours and many will be forced to sell. I would be very careful buying here. This could be back at 10k by the time you wake up tomorrow.

You know, unless it isn't the reason. If anything South Korea regulation is a much more likely culprit. Anyways, good luck baghilding to $5,000.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:48:20
The point he is making is moot. Bitcoin is now down almost $6000 from all time highs and holders are entering panic mode. Combined with the shadyness of Coinbase, the ability for hedge funds to short via option contracts, and tighter South Korean regulations, smart money is likely dumping hard. EOY selloff is a poor explanation for any pullback this hard, and people that bought in at the highs are wondering what the hell they just bought into. Don't get me wrong- I'll probably buy back into bitcoin but likely when the hype has died down and the price has stabilized in a year or so.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:57
Way to much volatility for your average investor. I would be careful. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:56:35
He argues the selloff is comparable due to the difference in liquidity. He then argues the exchanges are not comparable because of the difference in liquidity. There is no rational logic.

This analogy is stupid. Most people in the US don't have any idea on how to buy crypto. Not to mention the second largest economy, China, may not even allow crypto at all. First crypto needs to provide easier access and more than a whitepaper if you want to see market cap in the trillions.
The dot com bubble at least had actual companies that had audited financial results. We can't even verify if the 3rd most traded coin (Tether) has real money backing it.
I'd much rather invest in AI and driverless vehicles. Those field have had very visible progress in the last 5 years and address much larger problems.

They have been printing EURTether since January. Hundreds of millions. They switched to a lesser known Tether since the subpoena.
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:23:24
Great strategy until it isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:49:37
I will never buy Bitcoin as long as this much hype is there. Too many people getting in and they don't even know what they're buying. There is no reason BTC won't be trading at $1,000 again before it hits $10,000 if the hype dies off and momentum traders get scared.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:10:57
"Pledge" to HODL so they can continue to dump on newbies.

Cointelegraph isn't credible. I want to see a PR by Ali Baba.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:39:55
Have you heard of [INSERT SHILL COIN HERE]! It is literally tackling a multi-trillion dollar industry and anybody who buys today will be DRIVING A FUCKING LAMBO TO THE MOON so buy my fucking shill I will repeat this on 100 different forums every day until my fingers fucking fall off.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:16:01
Seriously. I think this is hard to visualize since people mostly hear about start ups worth billions of dollars. If this was 2001, sentiment would be very different.
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:12:37
Also, this article doesn't look credible in the slightest. The first example is speculation. I can't find a legitimate source for Ali Baba. The third - should we even care? This is a very niche market. I am also unable to find a source for Meitu.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:42:31
Which could just be due to people liquidating alts to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:36:32
The more circlejerk posts like this I read in this sub (to the moon!!!) the worse I think the bubble is. People are buying into Bitcoin for the hype more than anything.
It seems momentum is fueling bitcoin trading rather than fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:33:53
Don't even bother arguing with this dude. Just look at his comment history. He's a lost cause.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:09:18
Well what about this article? 
I need a PR from Ali Baba. There are no credible sources for them providing anything with crypto. They are all likely sourcing the same fake PR from Tencent. Please provide one legitimate source. If this was real everyone would be talking about it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:42:22
Seriously. There is no liquidity for any major bank to put in any notable amount of cash.

It's a stupid comparison. If anything what makes McDonald's successful these days is brand value and supply chain. I'd say brand value is better associated with Bitcoin than anything, which is in part due to it being the first of its kind. A better comparison might have been why is coke more popular than Pepsi.
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:19:45
Why is that staggering? Bitcoin is making the news every day and numerous asset managers have opinions on it. There is no doubt that Golden Sachs has done research on it, but I think it's highly unlikely they have any notable investments in Bitcoin. There just simply isn't enough information to know for certain if Bitcoin is worth ten fold its current value or a fraction of its current value. Anyone who believes otherwise is delusional.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:38:56
Uh. If you think that's the only reason why McDonald's is bigger than Wendy's then you are not very well informed.
First to market is certainly an advantage but there are so many factors as to why McDonald's is more successful than Wendy's.
Not to mention that this analogy has absolutely no logic as to why Bitcoin should run anything like a fast food business.

By balls deep you mean like less than 0.01% of their total assets, right?

If you're going to compare gold and BTC, think it's beter to compare total value of all gold mined versus all BTC to be mined. Gold estimated to be $8.2 trillion, BTC currently = $31.5 billion. BTC got a bit of a ways to go, but certainly making progress!
