You can also download the parametric-equation heart as a spreadsheet [from my Think Maths website](

Sorry to hear there was a problem. Wherever the coins have gone, if you drop me an email I'll make sure your order gets sent off! Any email on [Maths Gear]( will do, or [I'm over here](
If you have the details on what went wrong, send them over as well and I'll chase Coinbase from our end.

Thanks for putting us on Spendabit!

This is very true.
We plan to keep expanding Maths Gear but at the moment it's just the hobby of Steve Mould ( ), James Grime and me. So it suffers from our collective lack of free time. But we're growing slowly!

Well exactly. I've been into bitcoin for ages, but only finally got around to activating it on Maths Gear.
Thanks for adding us to those lists!

What better way to spend it, than on magic maths toys!
@_date: 2014-09-16 07:42:13
It's, like, £3.

We have talked about it. Any excuse to talk about hashing functions. Nothing planned yet though.
@_date: 2014-09-16 07:59:38
Perfect! That should be everything we need.
I'll see if there's any extra gifts around the office we can throw in your order. Spoiler: it's probably going to be a 'safety compass'. We thought they were hilarious. Now we don't know what to do with them.

Yes, in many countries we say things like 'maths' and 'physics'.
Whereas in the US, it's 'math' and 'physic'. Or something like that.

Yes, I do remember! I had no doubt you'd transfer it after and I did see it come in.
PS I'm [back at The Old Market]( next Tuesday with my solo show.

Fun fact: I paid for my wedding reception with bitcoin.
Anyway, congratulations and all the best for your big day!

In short: Yes, 'B' is 10 (or rather 00010 with extra zeroes to make it the full standard five digits) and the 010 in front of that indicate uppercase. 011 is lowercase, so 'b' is 01100010.
In long: [this book](

We accept Bitcoin on Maths Gear which is a UK company. Likewise struggle to spend them. They pay for my vpn, which feels pretty futuristic.
