So people search the term bitcoin when the price goes up. So if the price goes up again people will search bitcoin more and if it doesn’t then they won’t.

I’d bet against you. And you’d get ended

Today. No one knows what will out perform. Bitcoin has been the winner this year so far

Yea I guess it would depend on the initial cause of recession. In a perfect bitcoin world, the world economy goes sideways, governments race each other to devalue their currencies, inflation skyrockets everywhere, and bitcoin becomes the world currency.

Every time the price moves... manipulation!

I think it depends on the state of fiat. It could be that the next recession is complicated by a race to the bottom with every country competing to devalue their currencies. In this case, everyone is fleeing cash as well.

Yea you can transfer wherever you’d like

Only you can answer that. In the bitcoin reddit everyone is going to say yea
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:09:29
Explain what you mean please

Bitcoin is the lowest risk cryptocurrency. Also has outperformed the alt coins this year.

People are constantly calling for both directions. It’s all noise

Use cash app. Coinbase sucks. In addition to high fees they randomly use a payment processor in Europe which causes your bank to charge a 3% fee and then coinbase says sorry ask your bank for the money. I’m pretty sure they also are creating a price spread.

I like cash app better than coinbase. Linking to your bank account seems the most affordable option.

Nope you can link your bank account information and it won’t be considered a wire transfer. Every time I make a deposit into the app it’s free.

You’re an idiot. Boasting about this online. If caught you not only owe a lot of money, you’re gonna spend time in jail
