When the world economy runs on bitcoin, then yes, 1 BTC can fund a lot of channels. But with bitcoin's current market value 1 BTC is not much. I think even if bitcoin runs the world economy, the 1 BTC hubs won't be used that much because there will also be hubs that can fund a big part of the world like the Winklevoss twins or bitcoin exchanges. So if you use those superhubs you can pay almost everyone in the world, especially if they have channels with each other.
I can imagine some smaller hubs gaining users if the superhubs charge too high fees as a lot of small hubs connected can become very big together. And if there are any fees I think entities that pay each other very frequently will set up direct channels. But if the superhubs keep their fees low, I think they will dominate the transactions market.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:02:16
Yes, Marc pays Bob and Bob pays Alice. Bob can charge a little fee for this but there will be a lot of competition between hubs and the information they acquire can be valuable so the fee will be very small. At least that's what the devs think.

You can solve it temporarily with more frequent or bigger blocks like ETH or BCH but you can't keep doing that as bitcoin/crypto scales. Keeping every single transaction in a distributed ledger will destroy the decentralization. Unless someone comes up with a new technology, the only options to run the world economy are centralization or the Lightning Network.
Although I think right now a block size increase would be a good idea. Or rather a block frequency increase because the last orphaned block was in June. With 5 minutes blocks there would probably still be plenty of time to propagate blocks and we would have twice as fast and as many transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:40:50
We can't allow or disallow anyone to get involved in bitcoin or make futures of it. It's in the nature of bitcoin, there is no central authority so anyone can use it as they wish.

If we half the block size, that would mean blocks can be propagated faster, right? I think half the size and twice the frequency won't have any impact on bandwith requirements and the percentage of orphaned blocks won't increase a lot because it obviously takes less time to download a smaller block. I'm not an expert on the technical part of bitcoin though, so correct me if I'm wrong.

Yeah, the blockchain would take more storage and bandwidth for each node to store and update. If it gets too big only rich people or organisations will be able to have a full node, making bitcoin more centralized.

P2P transactions are clearly better than on centralized exchanges, but that's not realistic for small amounts with these fees.

The first block reward was as much as all the other block rewards in the first 4 years. Although the person who mined the first block has about 1 million BTC. It would be a problem if he sells all of that, but he disappeared a long time ago so I don't expect him to suddenly come back and sell his BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:00:48
You can't have that many connections with 1 BTC as you need to fund each channel to be able to pay the person on the other end of the channel. So the hubs will be the rich guys.

Miners would not pick up those transactions and nodes would drop them when their mempool gets bigger than their limit.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:06:57
The fee would be returned. If the transaction doesn't get confirmed, the fee never actually gets spent as there is no miner who receives it.
I think an attack from the bottom is not gonna have any harmful effect, as long as the fee is lower than any legitimate transactions that miners pick up. If you only outbid transactions that weren't gonna be confirmed anyway, there is no effect. You can only forcefully increase fees by paying high fees yourself.
An attack from the top is possible, but expensive. The total fee of 24.37 you mention is of the unconfirmed transactions that blockchain.info has in their mempool. The 24 hour total from confirmed tranactions is about 335 BTC, as stated here: 
I doubt if such an attack would be worth it because at some point the attacker will run out of funds or there will be a block size increase and bitcoin will do just fine again.

They could pay anyone in the network who their customer has an (indirect) connection with. They can pay the customer to pay someone else, basicly.
More likely they won't have direct channels with each customers if the LN grows big. The customer will pay a hub that has a short connection with Torguard (and a lot of other companies), so Torguard gets all the payments through the same channel. The hubs will be people/companies that have a lot of funds laying around that they are willing to lock in to receive fees or collect information about payments on the network.

Segwit transactions take less block weight so if a segwit and a legacy transaction pay the same fee, it is already more attractive for a miner to take the segwit transaction so he can fit more transactions in the block. If you want to increase the incentive, the best way to do that is make segwit transactions even cheaper in terms of block weight.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:19:32
That doesn’t apply to bitcoin as there’s a fixed production. If the gold price would go below the production price, miners would stop mining gold and the gold production will decrease. This would cause the price to go back up.
However if the bitcoin price goes below the production price, miners will leave causing the difficulty to decrease making it cheaper to produce bitcoin. The production rate remains the same and the production price moves.
It doesn’t matter if you use POW or POS, in both cases the production is fixed. Bitcoin is however more valueable than other cryptocurrencies because it’s the first and most secure network in terms of hash rate.

The futures price and spot price are tied by arbitrage. If the futures trade at a premium, you can make money by shorting the futures and buying BTC. If the futures are at a discount you can buy the futures and short BTC. This keeps the prices close to each other and means the future will have an effect on the price of real bitcoin.

If blocks can have more useless spam transactions without using more storage then there can also be more useful transactions. I don't see a disadvantage of using SegWit to make transactions lighter.

Bitcoin cash was created from bitcoin. Bitcoin cash supporters wanted to change the bitcoin protocol but a lot of nodes disagreed and didn't adopt the bitcoin cash protocol. From the time BCH supporters changed their protocol, they rejected blocks using the old protocol and Core supporters rejected blocks using the bitcoin cash protocol. This results in the blockchain seperating into 2 versions. This is called a hard fork. However both chains have the same transactions before the fork because before the fork they used the same rules. This is why you have bitcoin cash if you had bitcoin before the fork.

The scarcity of bitcoin is not ensured by the scarcity of energy.

The block size limit has been replaced by a block weight limit. The weight limit is 4 MB. For non-segwit transactions every byte has a weight of 4 bytes. For segwit transactions a byte has a weight of 1 byte. So if none of the transactions use segwit, the max block size is still 1 MB. If all transactions use segwit, the max size is 4 MB. Currently most transactions don't use segwit (yet) so the block sizes are still close to 1 MB.

All blocks before the fork are the same, so they had the same amount of coins right after the fork. Although currently there is 16,856,700 BCH in circulation and only 16,743,075 BTC. This is because even though both have the same block reward and adjust difficulty to get on average 1 block per 10 minutes, the difficulty has been very volatile.
Some miners have disturbed the difficulty of both chains by mining BCH when the BCH difficulty is low and then switching back to BTC when the BCH difficulty adjusted up, causing too little blocks to be mined and the difficulty going down again. Then they start mining BCH again. This switching between chains causes the block time to be more or less than 10 minutes. This is why bitcoin cash had more blocks since the fork and there is currently more BCH in circulation.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:04:04
No, there will also be 21 million BCH. They have a different price though.

Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin. So it's a different version of what used to be the same blockchain. What happened is that Bitcoin Cash supporters raised the block size limit from 1MB to 8MB. The Core supporters sticked with the old 1MB limit. When the first BCH block bigger than 1MB was mined, the Core nodes rejected it and kept building their chain with 1MB blocks. BCH nodes however do accept blocks above 1MB and built on the chain with big blocks. This way 2 different versions of the blockchain were being used. The small blockchain is recognized by a majority as the real Bitcoin so it's still being called Bitcoin. The big blockchain is considered an altcoin by the majority and is called Bitcoin Cash.
Although the 2 chains now use different rules for new blocks, they both agree on all blocks before the split. So if you had bitcoin before the split, you now have both BTC and BCH because both agree that the transaction in which you received bitcoin is valid. If you received bitcoin or bitcoin cash after the split, you'll only have coins on that chain as the other one will not accept the block in which you received your coins.
If it's still not clear maybe this video will help:

That Satoshi limited the blocksize doesn’t mean he didn’t intend to increase the limit as the network grew. I think we definetly do need blocksize limits so attackers can’t spam the network for free. But now the mempool is full and fees are very high so it’s time to make up some space for legit transactions. As I understand that was also Satoshi’s plan. Even with the lightning network we can’t replace fiat with 1MB blocks.

The only real limit is 0. I think it’s very unlikely it goes to 0 though because in all scenario’s, I expect bitcoin to stay significant in black market transactions. So even if all investors get out and bitcoin does not become a popular currency for legit transactions, I expect there will still be demand from criminals.
Mining does not provide any support. There will not be any less bitcoin if miners quit. The network functioned fine even before bitcoin had any value. And when bitcoin started being traded on exchanges, it had a value below 1 cent. If nobody else mines, bitcoin could even run on a single PC.

@_date: 2018-08-16 11:07:17
No, it’s not. The difficulty of mining is adjusted to keep an average time of 10 minutes between blocks and the bitcoin reward per block is constant between halvings. So the rate at which new bitcoins are mined is not affected by the price. If the price crashes, some miners might quit. But then the difficulty will simply decrease so the miners that are left still mine 1 block per 10 minutes on average and it will be cheaper to mine each block.
@_date: 2018-08-07 10:19:13

I wouldn’t say bitcoin is designed to undermine governments. I think it is ment to remove the need for financial institutions as third parties in payments.
The first line of the whitepaper’s abstract: “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
The first line of the introduction: “Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.”
Nowhere does it mention governments. I also think governments can do fine with bitcoin. Taxes would still be possible as cash is just as easy to hide as bitcoin and taxes were collected just fine in cash economies.

I am not by any means an expert on this so hopefully someone with more knowledge can either correct me or verify this, but this is how I understand it:
If someone has a satoshi and he sends you 0.6 satoshi, he has 0.4 satoshi left. When the channel closes like that, you get 1 satoshi and he gets 0. I don’t know what happens if you both have 0.5 satoshi though, but there should be some rule for that.

The difficulty of mining a block adjusts so on average it takes 10 minutes until a block is mined anywhere in the world. So the only reason it gets more expensive on average to mine a block is because new miners enter the competition or miners upgrade their machines. That’s won’t make the rate at which bitcoins are mined go down. That rate is almost fixed. So the high difficulty does not drive the price up.
If the average cost of mining one bitcoin is higher than the price, unprofitable miners will stop mining and mining will become easier.

The difficulty is rising because miners are constantly upgrading. That is why the bitcoin you get for the same work goes down. If miners stop upgrading the difficulty will stop rising. And if miners leave the difficulty will even go down. The difficulty adjustments’ goal is to keep an average of 1 block per 10 minutes.
But the reward per block halves about every 4 years. It’a 12.5 BTC now so after the next halving it will be 6.25 BTC. That does make the rate at which bitcoins are created go down. That has nothing to do with the cost of mining though, it is fixed since the creation of bitcoin when these halvings take place.

Turkey is in big trouble. USD/TRY increased 15.38% in a single day. USD/TRY is now at 6.4 and around the level of 7.0/7.1 Turkish domestic banks will start facing significant impact on their capital buffers. While inflation is way out of control at 15%, Erdogan continues to fight the “interest lobby” and opposes higher interest rates (which are already at 17.95%) to slow down the inflation. Estimates from major banks on what interest raise is needed range from 5% to 10%, which is clearly not going to happen.
The devaluation of the lira will cause loan defaults as 40% of the nation’s debt is denominated in foreign currencies such as the US dollar, greatly harming the economy and the banks in particular.
At this point Turkey would be wise to ask for the IMF’s support but Erdogan stated yesterday Turkey won’t give up any of their financial independence.
Turkey also keeps opposing the USA which could lead to further sanctions.
I think there’s a significant chance Turkey will face the same fate as Venezuela. I am holding on to my long on USD/TRY and am looking to increase my position after the weekend.

Such large amounts of bitcoin should be kept in cold storage.

You should put an order in the order book rather than just taking an existing order. So if you're selling, you should ask more than the highest bidder and when you're buying you should bid less than the lowest asker. Some exchanges like Bitfinex and GDAX have a "post only" option, so you can set your order to only be executed if it will be put in the order book, and cancelled if it would take an existing order. So you can be sure to always take the maker fee.
The downside of being a maker is that your transaction is not instant and you'll have to wait for someone to take your offer.
What's good about GDAX is that it has a lot of liquidity. The spread (difference between bids and asks) is very low. This makes it harder to fill your order as a maker, but as a taker you can always quickly sell or buy BTC for a reasonable price.
An advantage of Bitfinex that GDAX doesn't seem to have is the option to use a trailing stop. This means you set a price at which your position will be closed (like a normal stop), but if the price rises, your stop will be increased with the same amount. So if you put a stop at 1000 while the price is 1010 and the price rises to 1020, your stop will rise to 1010. And when the price falls to 1010, your position will be closed. You can use this to ride a pump and it will automatically sell when there's a dump. Be aware that there's a risk that the price will rise again after you automatically sold.
Also you can borrow money on Bitfinex to trade with. GDAX doesn't have that.
Also Bitfinex has a bit more altcoins you can trade than GDAX. But if you want to trade a lot of altcoins, you should go for Poloniex because they really have a lot of options.
I'd say Bitfinex is most advanced and their fees are 0.1 maker and 0.2 taker, which is low (for an exchange with fees).
So if you want to speculate on BTC I would either go for Bitfinex or an exchange without fees. If you want to speculate on altcoins, Poloniex (0.15, 0.25) is the way to go.
If you want to buy and hold for a long term, consider lending your BTC to traders on Bitfinex or Poloniex. The traders will be forced to liquidize their positions if their liquidity gets too low. This will protect your investment if you lend. Poloniex requires borrowers to have the same amount of money of their own as they borrow and Bitfinex only requires 15%, so Poloniex is safer. But Bitfinex is bigger so more loans are taken, so your BTC will spend less time doing nothing.
There are a lot more exchanges so you could do some more research to find out which 1 you want to use. Look at the fees, spread and if you can use stop orders, trailing stop and if you want to be a maker, a post only option will help. And if you want to leverage your trades look for leverage, margin trading or lending.

Well, simple. If people spend BTC, other people earn BTC. That is how an economy works.
If all the BTC which are in circulation are lended, than it will be impossible to pay interest on all of those loans. But it's not like that. The economy is bigger than the loans. You can earn enough BTC to pay interest on your loan.
Also with fiat money, you can get loans for like 8%, which is a lot more than the amount of money that's being printed/created every year. And it works with fiat too.

Can you still withdraw USD and EUR? Because then you could just buy some of those and withdraw that if you want to get your funds out.
Otherwise you'll just have to wait until everything works again.
@_date: 2017-02-25 13:31:39
Not all traders have the same preferences, some want to make a deal quickly and choose to be a taker, some want low fees and a better price (profiting from the spread). As a maker you'll also have to update your price often. If the price is rising and you put a buy order, you'll have to increase your bid often because you'll be outbid.
You can also choose to set orders somewhere below the current price, so people will sell to you when the price dropped. That way you can buy in a dip with maker fee.
I think people have trouble trusting no fee exchanges since their business model is not very clear. However they can earn money by lending. Another explaination might be that all/most no fee exchanges were Chinese before China obiligated them to charge fees. China often attacks bitcoin with regulations so maybe traders don't trust China because of that, and they all settled with the exchanges with fees. And once people are settled, they don't change quickly.
If you trade at Bitfinex I think you can withdraw to your bank. I think either their bank or your bank will change it to EUR. I'm not sure about that though. And if you can't withdraw USD, you can simply withdraw BTC instead and sell it somewhere else.

That's not intrinsic value though. Intrinsic value is the value of the resource in a coin, like gold. You can't melt your bitcoins, they just rely on trust. Although we should not forget the same is true for government money.

I don't know the odds, but almost all analysts and redditors say the ETF is more likely to be denied than approved. So I just follow the crowd.
Although I do think the risk/reward is good because I expect the price to react stronger to an approval than to a rejection. Because with a rejection, our situation basicly stays the same as it is now and almost everyone expects rejection so approval would be a bigger surprise, triggering a stronger reaction.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:06:02
Isn't it better if people do the same as you are doing? If you're going long, you want people to do the same so the price rises. So I don't see why people would tell you to do the opposite.

If you want to use Bitfinex you can idneed just buy your BTC somewhere else and deposit to Bitfinex. If you do that I recommend letting the merchant you get your BTC from send them straight to your deposit adress on Bitfinex, like it is your own adress. This way you won't have to pay transaction fees twice.
On Bitfinex there is a peer-to-peer lending system. There is a seperate orderbook for it where you can offer and demand loans. The interest is currently about 0.0175% per day (6.6% annualized), but this changes constantly. You can offer and demand loans for any period between 2 and 30 days. I think the interest rates are insignificant if you compare them to what you can earn or lose by trading. The current daily interest is even less than the taker fee.
If you want to trade on a euro market, I don't know any exchanges that offer margin trading or loans. Kraken is the biggest market, but I don't like their fees. Itbit is also quite big and has a taker fee of 0.2% and 0% maker, which is actually better than Bitfinex and GDAX. I'm not sure if they have things like trailing stops but since they don't advertise it I think they don't. If you want to be sure you should make an account and see for yourself.
So if you want to go for low fees and direct euro deposits, Itbit is best. If you want an advanced platform and loans, Bitfinex.
If you want no fees, quoine is a good option. I don't know about their reputation but they're the biggest and offer margin trading, trailing stops and I just found out you can also give loans. There's euro too.
Here's a list of no-fee exchanges sorted by volume: 
@_date: 2017-02-24 11:36:45
Those fees are all correct. As a maker, gdax is indeed the best of your list (if you just look at fees).
Take into account there is usually deposit and withdrawal fees for fiat and withdrawal fees for crypto. But if you keep your funds in the same exchange for a long time that isn't very important.
There are also exchanges without trade fees like quoine.

I said the bitcoin economy is bigger than the loans in bitcoin. And I would say loans work in fiat. I can take a loan and be able to pay it back, with interest.
The other guy said the interest on BTC loans can't be paid because there is no endless supply. So I explain to him the bitcoin economy will support the interest.
Do you have any statistics backing up that 97%?
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:20:41
So bitcoins are only valueable because people give it value. Because they recognize the system is useful and agree to use it as a currency. But if the price of BTC collapses you can't get anything back. It's not like a golden coin that you can melt, so it doesn't have intrinsic value. It's value is only decided by people's trust in the system, just like fiat.
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:42:51
You could show them  where you cansee stores that accept bitcoin on a map to prove you can buy a lot of legal stuff with bitcoin. 
Or you could show them  where you can see the total value of all bitcoins (market cap) and the trade volume of the last 24 hours on exchanges.
Or the price chart of the year at 
If you end up in a discussion again, do not deny that bitcoin is used for illegal stuff, always admit when you can't deny something. Just explain that it's used for a lot more and the economy is growing quickly. Some people already receive their salary in BTC.

I think 60 sat/byte is a bit low. According to  41-60 sat/byte will take between 55 minutes and infinity. Although 61-80 is only 22 hours tops.
I'd raise the fee if I were you. If you pay 161-180 sat/byte it should be confirmed within 30 mins. Use  to choose your fees. The amount of unconfirmed transactions is rising rapidly so you have to pay quite a high fee atm.

Never mind about the merchant site, I don't need to know. I found out that you can indeed pay straight from coinbase.

You could earn bitcoin by trading it or if that's too much effort, lend it on Poloniex or Bitfinex. Bitfinex has higher interest than Poloniex and a more steady demand, so I'd go for Bitfinex if you want to lend.

The economy is bigger than just loans and hodlers. The interest could be earned by the BTC moving on exchanges or another business.
In the last 24 hours 28503 BTC have been moved between wallets, which is like 33.4 million USD. So there is definetly an economy to profit from.
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:37:22
The problem with arbitrage is that fiat money is slow and expensive to move. SEPA bank transfers are free at my bank, but some charge fees. Even if it's free for both sides, it can still take a day. In a day, a lot can change on the bitcoin markets. Other payment methods usually cost like 1%. Also Localbitcoins charges 1% to sellers, making it harder to profit.
So I think it's better to daytrade. But if you do choose to sell on localbitcoins, you should only accept payment methods that can't be reversed. Because your bitcoin payment can't be reversed either. So no Paypal and CC.
About the strategies, I use unconventional strategies (which I'm not going to share) so I don't have much experience in the conventional strategies. I don't know what strategies and bots would be good. But I can say that you shouldn't panic when the price drops by a lot, because it will probably go back. And don't get too hyped when the price rises without any reason, because it will probably fall when the hype is over.
I wouldn't say 200 is too low. You should always start small when you try a new strategy and only start scaling up if you've tried it for at least a month and have made a good amount of trades.
I can't predict your profits. Maybe you'll lose 50% in a month or maybe you'll double. Keep in mind that your profits or losses won't be stable. It will be different every month. If you do good, your investment will grow and the amount you're trading with will get bigger, meaning you can make more profit. That way your investment can grow exponentially. The sky is the limit. But never invest more than you can afford to lose, because bitcoin is unpredictable.
@_date: 2017-02-17 18:36:39

You shouldn't use exchanges to store BTC. Use exchanges when you want to trade, if you just want to hold, use your wallet. And if you trade big amounts you better do it on multiple exchanges, so if 1 collapses you only lose part of your investment.

But people still needed retail, although it is another kind of retail. People didn't start producing their own products. With Bitcoin, banks are not needed to store money.

Digital photography just replaced companies by other companies. But with Bitcoin banks lose a lot of their business to consumers who will be their own bank. Banks will only be needed for things such as loans and managing investments, but a lot of people will stop keeping their money on a bank account. So the banking business will get a lot smaller, while digital photography only made the photography industry bigger.
Another comparison is how bakers are being replaced by supermarkets. The bakers are screwed, but people still buy their bread from companies. If people would grow their own wheat and baked their own bread, both bakers and supermarkets would be screwed and nobody could replace them.

Anywhere between now and March 11 a decision will be made about the approval of the first bitcoin ETF. Chances are it will be denied, which will cause a severe drop. But if it gets approved, we'll go up a lot.
If you want certainty, you should wait for the decision. If it's approved, buy. If it's denied, wait for the bottom and then buy.
What you could also do is buy now and put it on an exchange, where you put a stop limit order. So you set it to sell when the price drops below a certain number. Make sure to set that price low enough so it won't be reached before the decision by random movements, but high enough so you won't lose too much. And when it's approved it will just rise and your BTC won't be sold.

First of all it’s not true that the block reward will be removed.
Second even if it would be removed, that should not affect the price (fee) or supply of transaction processing. By the rules of the protocol, the difficulty of mining is adjusted so that on average there are 10 minutes between blocks. So we don’t need many miners to get transactions processed. Actually a single miner would do. If the block reward is reduced, in theory fewer miners will compete for the smaller reward. But that only means the remaining miners will get to mine more blocks. There will not be fewer blocks and there will not be fewer transactions processed.

Stablecoins rely on fiat which is contantly being devalued. Even if the stablecoin’s issuer keeps their promise to give you fiat when you request it, you still lose wealth.
You also need to trust the issuer to not inflate the supply beyond their reserves, or you will end up with an additional layer of fiat.
Fiat is just the (broken) promise of gold, which is very weak currency. Even weaker would be the promise of fiat.

Yes, because if the price goes up or transaction fees rise (for example due to more transactions), then miners will get higher rewards. Then more miners will enter and existing miners will invest more, resulting in higher hash rates. To adjust for this, the difficulty will go up.

It’s total bullshit. You can’t value a good only based on the amount of new goods produced compared to how much is around.
According to this “model”, the price of bitcoin has to go to infinity as there will eventually be no supply of new bitcoins at all. That would mean 1 satoshi can buy everything, which is obviously impossible.
Even if there would be a more sensible formula that didn’t go to infinity, you can’t use supply only. The demand side is not constant. Also supply doesn’t only come from new bitcoins. Existing bitcoins are also offered on the market and/or used to buy goods.
That being said, it is good for the value of a currency to have a high stock to flow ratio because a quickly increasing supply (a low stock to flow ratio) will decrease the value of a currency. But you can’t base the price of bitcoin on just that.

Firstly, every day transactions probably won’t be made on-chain. They will use the lightning network for instant and cheap transactions. On-chain transactions only need to be made to open and close lightning channels.
Secondly, the current transactions limit is artificial. It is not a technical limit but a rule agreed on by the community to keep block size scarce so people won’t waste it or intentionally spam transactions. If the community agrees is it necessary, the block size will be increased so more transactions can be made.

A big reason why bitcoin is valueable is it's scarcity. This and decentralization are why people find it a good currency/store of value. If the 21m cap is increased, bitcoin loses it's scarcity because the cap could be increased infinitely. This would destroy the trust in bitcoin and because of that it's value. Since (almost) everyone running a node has a stake in bitcoin, they would lose wealth if they accept this change.

Now that BCH has a higher price, it is more profitable to mine it than before, but at these prices BTC should keep the majority of miners.
Let's assume miners are rational and want to maximize profit. To keep things simple we ignore transaction fees and only look at the block reward. The block reward is the same for both chains, meaning miners are competing for the same amount of coins. Because BTC is more expensive, that means the total profit of miners is higher on the BTC chain. Miners will choose to mine the chain that is most profitable for them individually. Because the total profit is bigger on the BTC chain, more miners can compete without becoming less profitable than the BCH chain. This is why BTC will have more hash rate at these prices. If miners are rational, they will distribute their hash rate among the chains according to the price.
However miners can have ideological reasons to choose 1 chain over the other, even if this reduces their profit. This is why hash rate won't spread out completely equal to the price, but it is a good guideline.

Generally want small blocks (1 MB) so the blockchain doesn't grow too fast, which would make running a full node expensive in the long run. Instead they want to scale with segwit, which makes transaction need less space in blocks and fixes transaction malleability. They also want to use lightning network to settle transactions off-chain.
Generally want big blocks (8 MB) to allow more transactions on them. They believe there would still be many people who got rich with bitcoin who would be willing to run a full node. They oppose segwit and lightning network. I'm not sure but I think this is because they think segwit and LN will make transactions less secure. Also they think fixing transaction malleability is not important. They have their own sub because they believe censorship is applied on They support the BCH fork because it has big blocks and does not have segwit.
So why is hostile to and core devs? Because they disagree on those subjects and is also hostile to them.

Almost nobody would agree to that. And miners aren’t really that powerful. Users decide what chain becomes more valuable and thus most profitable for miners. Even if a lot of miners are stubborn and stick to their preferred chain, they’ll run out of money if they mine an unprofitable chain and they’ll have to stop resisting.
Also mining won’t stop if there aren’t any more bitcoins produced. Miners will still mine for transaction fees.

The halving doesn’t affect how many transactions the blockchain can handle. It will reduce miners income which might make some miners leave, but then the difficulty will go down. There will still be an average of 1 block per 10 minutes.
So the halving doesn’t have any effect on the supply of transaction processing. Neither does it on the demand. So the transaction fees shouldn’t change.

Depends which country. The EU is not like the US. It’s just a cooporation between countries. Different European countries have different taxes.
In the Netherlands we have a very simple system for capital gains tax. You just report how much your net worth is at January 1 and the government assumes everyone earns a certain percentage on their capital.
It’s unfair for those who invest badly or just keep everything in a savings account. But it’s a lot easier since you don’t need to calculate the profit for all of your transactions, which would be a nightmare if you trade frequently or have a lot of investments.
But that’s just Dutch law. I heard in Germany you do need to keep track of all trades. I don’t know about any other countries.

1. If mining becomes unprofitable for some miners, they might stop mining. In that case there will be a lower network hash rate and the difficulty will go down, increasing the profitability of mining again.
Remaining miners will have fewer competitors, makinh it easier for them to profit.
2. Miners will earn bitcoin from transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-08-02 09:01:58
Sort of but not really.
On Blockchain.com you can only trade a few cryptocurrencies against each other. And everything is settled on-chain. So if you want to buy bitcoin with ethereum you'll need to wait for the bitcoin transaction to get confirmed. Also the mining fees will be uneconomical for small transactions.
Also Blockchain.com doesn't have actual fiat. It only has USD Pax which is backed by the USD. But you need to trust the company to actually have enough US dollars in reserve.
So it's not suitable if you want fast transactions, trade small amounts and trade in fiat.
If you like the idea of settling transactions on-chain and keeping your funds in your wallet, you can use a decentralized exchange like Bisq. The advantage is you don't need to trust anyone to keep your funds safe. The disadvantage is there will be a lot less liquidity so you either get worse prices or you need to wait longer to get a good price.
Personally, I'd recommend a centralized exchange (so not Bisq) for trading. If you want to hold funds for a long time, I'd suggest withdrawing from centralized exchanges and keeping the funds safe yourself, like with a hardware wallet.

Currently 12.5 bitcoin is mined with every block, which is on average each 10 minutes. Every 210,000 blocks (about every 4 years) the amount of bitcoin mined per block halves.
Currently the annualized increase of bitcoin in circulation is 3.71%.  After the next halving event on 14 May 2020, that will be 1.8%. It will continue to go down because of the halvings and the bitcoin supply increasing.
In total only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist. Currently there is 18 million bitcoin which means only 3 million more is left to be mined.
@_date: 2019-10-30 23:27:19
You need to predict the future. It’s probably possible, but hard. It is hard because it’s a competitive game. If you buy bitcoin before it goes up, that means someone else sold it before it went up. For every winner there’s a loser.
The competition is strong. It’s not about beating the majority of the people, it’s about beating the majority of the money. And the smartest people have the most money. But if you outsmart them, then yes, you can make a large amount of money flipping bitcoin. If you don’t outsmart them, you’ll lose money instead.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:41:48
If bitcoin is the future, then most transactions won’t be settled on-chain. You can use the lightning network for instant transactions that still use the security of the blockchain.
I also expect bitcoin banks to emerge for people who don’t trust themselves in securing their private keys and find bitcoin and the lightning network too complicated. Maybe most transactions will be settled between banks. But at least there will be a choice not to use banks. Which makes it a lot harder for them to abuse their position. If they create bank bitcoin out of thin air, people will use real bitcoin instead.
The swift network, where your daily payments are settled, is much slower than the bitcoin blockchain. But you don’t notice that because of all the solutions built on top of it. The underlying system for final settlement doesn’t have to be fast, it needs to be secure. Faster solutions, such as the lightning network, will be built on top of it, while still using the security of those final settlements.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:23:57

If the rich and the poor invest the same percentage of their net worth and income at the same time, then it doesn't matter. But in absolute numbers, yes, those who can invest more will earn more.

@_date: 2019-02-14 09:05:43
The fact it’s impossible to block transactions is one of the key features of bitcoin. We shouldn’t want to make that possible because we’d either 1. give power to an authority that decides who gets blocked and can abuse this power or 2. we somehow do it democratically and all unpopular people would be blocked.
Even if we did this anyway, the schemes would simply change addresses. Most people use a different address for every transaction they receive anyway.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:06:00

If you want to keep things simple and not learn about things like orderbooks and limit orders, use Coinbase. If you feel you’re up to it you can always switch to Coinbase Pro, which is like Bitstamp and Kraken.
So Coinbase for simplicity.

I think the same confirmation time would provide more certainty with faster blocks, given nobody has 51% (then nothing can give certainty). 
Say an evil entity has 40% of the hash rate. Correct me if I’m wrong but I’d say for any block, they’d have 40% chance of mining it before someone else does, no matter the difficulty. Getting ahead of other miners would be equally difficult with 5 minute blocks. I think the probability this evil entity will succeed in an attack without having 51% is only decided by the number of blocks we wait before accepting a transaction and the percentage of hash rate this evil entity has. The block time should not affect the chance of this entity mining a block.

Good point. As mining gets more competitive and profit margins get smaller, I can see how this can become a competitive advantage. Combined with other competitive advantages 5 minute blocks could actually increase centralization as large and professional entities are more efficient.

I don't want to abandon the idea of 5 minute blocks but because of your argument I'd need more research and calculations to decide if it's a good idea.

Interesting idea. You need to know there aren't multiple paper bills with the same code. I think to achieve that, the holder of the paper bill must be able to take control of the bitcoin wallet matching the bill, at the cost of destruction of the bill. This way if the government were to start issueing double bills, soon someone would claim the wallet of such a bill and if someone checks the other bill carrying the same code, they'll notice it's been claimed already, exposing the fraud.

@_date: 2019-02-22 09:32:47
Why not make this reasonable amount of time shorter? The only disadvantage I see is a higher orphanage rate, but is that really such a problem, given the current rate? Even if we all use lightning, faster blocks means faster channel opening and closing.
From a safety perspective, I suppose orphaning rate would double. However in the same amount of time (10 minutes) you can get a higher certainty of confirmations. Assume orphaning rate is now
1% (which it is not). It would become 2%. However in 10 minutes, which would be 2 blocks, the chance there are still 2 chains is the chance of 2 orphans in a row. Since 0.02 * 0.02 &lt; 0.01, two 5 minute blocks give a higher certainty than one 10 minute block.

I believe the 2 of you would both need to sign a transaction to do anything with the 3rd person’s bitcoin. Otherwise I think it will be stuck in the wallet. You could include it in the channel by signing a transaction that also includes the old funds and has a locktime that is shorter than the most recent lightning transaction. Alternatively you could simply both sign a transaction that sends the 3rd person’s bitcoin to any other address or splits it between any other addresses.

Now that orphaning is so uncommon, would it be a good idea to decrease block time? For example we go from 10 minutes blocks to 5 minutes blocks and half the reward per block and the block size limit. 
The transaction capacity and inflation rate would remain the same but transactions can be verified faster. The disadvantage is the orphaning rate will increase (I think it would double). But since the orphaning rate is so low, I think we can accept that.

11 sat/byte might be too small. But 20 sat/byte should get confirmed in 35 minutes to 27 hours (with 90% certainty) according to  For a median transaction that would be about $0.31. Still a bit expensive to buy a coffee, but possible. I think for now it's better to use fiat for buying coffee and bitcoin for buying anything that's at least as expensive as a game or a book. Too replace fiat completely we'll need to handle the micro-transactions too. Hopefully the lightning network can do that for us.

It depends if you care if the recipient of your payments knows your wealth. If you don't care about him knowing how much BTC you have, there's no disadvantage to option 1. 
If you value your privacy, go for option 2. It's a one-time job to send the 100 transactions (or even 1 transaction with 100 outputs). You can have multiple addresses in the same client so it won't be more work to spend it. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated hiding your wealth, I would randomize the amounts sent to each address. If you distribute 100 BTC equally, it would be obvious all the receiving addresses belong to the same entity. If one address receives 1.1 BTC and another one 0.55 BTC and another one 0.35 BTC, it would be less obvious. Just use some random amounts to distribute your BTC without a clear pattern.
To spend it, you will have to pay higher transaction fees as you have more inputs. Also to distribute across your own addresses, you'll need to pay for 100 outputs. However with an average of 1 BTC per address, I wouldn't worry about it. It would still come down to a tiny percentage.

The size of a block is the size (in bytes) of the included transactions combined. A miner can choose which transactions to include without exceeding the max block size. Putting transactions in the block is not hard at all. The difficulty is in finding the block first, which means finding the right hash, which gets harder if too many blocks are mined and easier if too few are mined. This has nothing to do with the size of the block.

An instant transaction crypto would not be secure. If a nodes accepted transactions instantly, you could simply send 2 transactions with the same money at the same time and some nodes will accept transaction A and some will accept transaction B. You have now double spent your money. This is why we have blocks.
Zero transaction fees means there is nothing stopping people from spamming the network with transactions. Also there would have to be a high block reward forever to keep an incentive for miners. This means the crypto supply will increase forever.
If you want instant payments with zero or very low fees, use the lightning network.

I don't think McDonalds would need to wait for a confirmation for a 2 dollar transaction. Worst case scenario someone will steal a big mac.

It’s only gonna be a permanent situation if there’s a cyber war or other nations block Russia off the worldwide web.
So let’s say that happens. The world blocks Russia and Russia blocks the world. In border regions Russians should still be able to connect to the world’s internet. If any blocks are mined or transactions are broadcasted in Russia, it can spread from nodes in border regions that connect to the worldwide web. 
It would take longer than usual to spread blocks from the rest of the world through Russia and to spread Russian blocks through the rest of the world. This would mean more blocks will be orphaned. This problem becomes smaller if there are more nodes at the border connecting Russia to the rest of the world.

Halvings don't seem to have a short-term effect on hash rate. If you look at a graph of the hash rate around the last halving, you won't be able to see when the halving happened. The hash rate only kept increasing.
If half the hash rate disappears overnight then yes, there will be 20 mins blocks until the difficulty adjustment. Some miners might expand their operation in anticipation of the difficulty adjustment though. But even if they don't, we'll survive 20 min blocks for a while.
If somehow it gets really bad and the whole thing does grind to a halt, we would reach concensus on forcing a difficulty adjustment or changing the adjustment system through a hard fork. But I don't see how that would ever be necessary.

Nicehash provides real numbers. It only said you'll be unprofitable because he got the electricity cost wrong.

It is important to note Nicehash's calculator calculates the expected profit if you mine with them, switching between currencies to mine the most profitable one (which is probably not bitcoin) and then buying bitcoin with those alts. And you can do that without mining hardware as many coins have algorithms that mining hardware can't mine.

Kraken for example charges 0.26% fees for the smallest volumes. If you trade more, you’ll get lower fees. It’s reasonable exchanges take a fee for the service they provide. You can’t exchange fiat currencies without fees either.
Yes, there is some KYC hassle. Some exchanges check the documents really fast, some take a working day or a few, but then you’re set. You can’t set up a bank account without some KYC either.
Withdrawing fiat from an exchange shouldn’t take more than a working day, which is only because international bank transactions are slow. That’s not bitcoin’s fault, it’s the banking system’s. Withdrawing bitcoin should be done in half an hour.

It doesn't actually. The reason a lot of electricity is currently being used is that the difficulty adjusts to keep the average block time at 10 minutes. So if there are more miners, there won't be more Bitcoins. So miners must compete to get the block rewards that are only "given" once every 10 minutes. If the price goes down, fewer miners will join the competition and less electricity will be used while the block time and reward stay the same.

Fees are not based on how much money you transfer. They are based on the amount of inputs (how many adresses you received the coins from) and outputs (how many adresses you will send to). So you could get the same fee if you transfered 100 OMG, which means your fee would be 0.1%.
Edit: When you transfer from an exchange they charge you a fixed fee. If the network fees change, the withdrawal fees on the exchange can become too high sometimes. But you should only use exchanges to buy and sell crypto, not to store it long-term or receive crypto on (unless you're planning to sell it).

As long as you have the private keys, it is safe to keep your BTC there during a hard fork. If you keep them with a third party like Coinbase, it depends on their policy. They can choose if they keep the new coins or give them to you.
If no HF happens, then there's nothing to worry about and you can use your coins like always. If a HF does happen, it's safest to split your coins by sending them to another wallet on 1 of the chains and keeping them in the same wallet on the other chain. This way you're safe against replay attacks, even if the HF does not have replay protection.
After HF, be aware that "wallets" of the new coin can be phishing sites to get your private key. This happened with BCH. Make sure you know for sure the wallet is real if you enter your key anywhere.

Well, if the Bitcoin price stabilizes and Bitcoin gets "accepted" by more merchants, it will be a lot easier to get more real adoption. Maybe it wouldn't help Bitcoin if merchants only accepted Bitcoin to convert it to fiat, but they would encourage other merchants and consumers to start using Bitcoin.

Any big exchange that has a BCH/BTC pair will do. You don't need to keep those large sums on there for long, you just deposit the BCH, sell for BTC and withdraw the BTC immediately.
The bittrex.com exchange is good. Although I don't think you need to worry about it, they have a good cyber security team. If you get basic verification (which can be done in minutes), you can withdraw up to 3 BTC a day. If you need more, you can get enhanced verification (which requires you to send documents) to withdraw up to 100 BTC a day.
If you want to sell very big amounts, you might want to split it in multiple trades. If you sell a lot at once, you might fill all the orders with a reasonable price and sell part of your BCH too cheap.
I don't know much about spending the BCH from your wallet. You'll need to import your private keys or wallet file into a bitcoin cash client/wallet. But I'm not sure how much risk there is of a replay attack (that someone does the same transaction on the BTC chain) and if you need to take measures to prevent this.

Both chains are built on Satoshi's ideas, but bitcoin has developed after Satoshi so neither are the same as the original any more. Segwit is an idea that didn't exist yet when Satoshi was around, so that is not according to the whitepaper.
I would not say it's a bad thing to change the whitepaper's bitcoin. Technology like bitcoin should be developed and not stay the same for years and unlike some people think Satoshi is not a god who knows everything. There are more smart developers who can come up with good ideas and the situation now is very different from 2008.

They must first acquire those billions of BTC. Then they can sell it and start rewriting history to get their BTC back.

Night is not at the same time all over the world. Maybe fees are lower when the most bitcoin users are sleeping. But it doesn't matter if you send your transaction at night. If you place it during the day, it will still be in the mempool at night and miners can still choose to confirm it.

The car company would need to tell the bank who bought the car because it happened with cash. But yes, they could know that only recently someone withdrawed the cash from his bank account. But it would be pretty much impossible to keep track of where cash goes, unless you ask the people who you know had the cash (the bitcoin buyer and car company).

Well, you can do with the basic verification which requires you to give them some information like your name and address (and maybe phone number) and you can withdraw 3 BTC a day, so like 90 BTC a month. If you sell your BCH for 0.15, that means you could sell 600 BCH a month with basic verification. If that is still not enough you could sign up on multiple exchanges and spread your BCH among them.
With such big amounts, I would recommend you to split your BTC and BCH before spending any major amount. You make a new BTC wallet and send your BTC there or make a new BCH wallet and send your BCH there. This way you can't get replay attacks because your coins don't have the same private keys.
If you should sell your BCH depends on what you think will happen to it's price. If you think it will get more popular, you better hold on to it, but if you think BTC will make bigger gains, then sell them for BTC. But I would not hold them just because it's easier.

Whether bitcoin is cheap depends on what you think it is. If you think it's the future and will replace all other currencies, then the current price is definetly cheap. If you think it's only for speculation, then the price is expensive.
Just looking at the price is too simple. You should compare the price with how useful and rare whatever you're buying is. There are only a few altcoins that are in any way useful. Most are just knock-offs of bitcoin. And bitcoin is definetly by far the most useful as it is actually being accepted as a currency.

In the candle of 14:00 UTC, BTC went up quite a lot at the same time the S&amp;P 500 stock index went down after North Korea's statements. It does seem like traders think war is bullish for bitcoin. They might be right because war would harm fiat as economies will be damaged and governments might print money to fund the war. This will result in a loss of trust in fiat, which could increase the adoption of bitcoin.
There's also a bearish argument for the effect of a crisis (and maybe war): if bitcoin investors get trouble with their personal finance they might need to sell their bitcoin to buy goods.
You should figure out for yourself which of those effects will be stronger. The traders seem to think the loss of faith in fiat (bullish) outweighs the need of investors to get cash (bearish).

That would make it cheaper and faster. But that also means more people do it and you still need to consider that prices will change while you move you funds (which probably takes like 30 minutes with BTC). To make it faster and cheaper I recommend you to send funds directly from exchange to exchange without your own wallet between them.
If you want to know if this can be profitable, you'll need to make your own calculations. Take into account trade fees and withdrawal fees on the exchanges and make sure the profit is not very small compared to a typical price change of 30 minutes.

There is not 1 single price for bitcoin. There is a free market where prices naturally form by supply and demand like any other free market.

If you want to buy bitcoin, you can buy XBT on Kraken. XBT is short for bitcoin, the X means it's not affiliated to a country. XBT means the same as the more common BTC, both stand for bitcoin.
I think Kraken is a good exchange. They meet up to regulations so you'll need to verify your identity and provide proof of your address (for example a gas bill) before you can deposit GBP. Because of this it will take a bit longer before you can get started than on a more anonymous exchange, but it makes them more trustworthy.
If you want to trade, it makes sense to keep your coins on kraken so you don't have to deposit and withdraw every time you make a trade. If you want to hold your bitcoin for a long time, you should withdraw it. I suggest you use the [electrum](electrum.org) wallet which gives you full control and allows you to choose your transactions fees. You should activate 2 factor authentication. Make sure to back-up the 2FA key so you don't lose access if you lose your phone.
This set-up is relatively safe. If you start holding large amounts I recommend you to use a paper or hardware wallet.

The market cap is by an average of the last traded rate on many exchanges multiplied by the total BTC that has been mined. So yes, mined coins are counted as part of the market cap. But if nobody wants to buy bitcoin, it has a value of 0. That also means the lost coins have a value of 0.
Theoretically it is perfectly possible for the value to drop to 0. In practice it will probably only happen if the cryptography is broken or a bug in the protocol makes it unusable as a currency.

They could, but any other node could reject it, splitting the network. You don't have to follow the majority.
A bigger problem when a single entity has 51% of the hash rate is that they could rewrite history and say the transactions they sent never happened.

This would probably not be so profitable for them though, as it would make their investment in mining equipment worthless if they destroy BTC.

There are a few exchanges where you can buy Doge with BTC, but I'd recommend Bittrex because they're trusted and are experts at cyber-security. Go over to bittrex.com, make an account and get the basic verification by providing some personal details and maybe your phone number. Deposit BTC at the wallets tab, look for doge in BTC markets, if you're there you fill in the left form to buy doge. For units you can click max to buy as much as you can, for bid you can take the ask price if you want it immediately. Keep the defaults "limit" and "good till cancelled". Click "buy dogecoin".

The difficulty of mining adjusts to keep an average of 10 minutes between blocks. About every 4 years the reward per block halves, so only half as much bitcoin will be mined. The next halving is expected on June 14 2020.
The bitcoin price has always been predicted to crash by many people. It has also always been predicted to rise by many people. Everybody's just guessing, nobody knows.

I think simply leveraging the S&amp;P 500 long-term is not a great strategy because you can't leverage it into extreme profits because it's too volatile for that.
You did get me thinking though. Investing in indices is a good alternative to investing in stocks because they are less volatile but have the same average profit. Now what if you combine indices by longing a lot of them at the same time? Like an indice of indices. I'd expect a lot less volatility allowing more leverage without decreasing the profitability. 
You could also take the leverage to an extreme. Say you have 50% chance to lose 100% but also 50% chance to win 200%. If you go all-in you'll almost certainly have made 100% loss after a couple of trials. However if you always invest 20% of your capital, it is impossible to lose all and with enough trials you'll always win.
If you use a hell lot of leverage and guaranteed stop-losses, you can have a situation similar to this. I think with an indice of indices as described above you'd have good chances per trade.

Right now Bitcoin is only good for bigger transactions. Not to buy coffee, but to buy a game for example. All transactions that are settled on the blockchain need to be stored on thousands of nodes. If the blockchain gets too big, many nodes will stop running which would make it more centralized. This is why we have limits on block sizes and why you have to pay fees for miners to include you in their block.
In the future we will probably have the [lightning network]( which will allow us to settle transactions off-chain instantly and at a very low cost. When the lightning network gets launched, you can use bitcoin to buy coffee or a cookie with low fees.

You paid a very low transaction fee. As miners can choose which transactions to include in their blocks, they'll always take the ones with the highest fees. Your transaction might still come through but this is uncertain. If not, your bitcoin will reappear in your wallet after some time. 
You can use  to see estimates of how long a transaction will take at various fees in satoshi/byte. If you want your transaction confirmed in the next block, you should pay 210sat/byte at the moment. From 110sat/byte it becomes at least 90% certain your transaction will be confirmed within 31 hours. Any less and it's possible it won't be confirmed at all. This minimum fee is higher than usual. If you're not in a rush and want to save money you might want to wait for a while for the fees to get lower.

His main argument is that a lot of nodes need to agree on his transaction before it's concluded. But as long as nobody does a hardfork, they all follow the same rules to decide if a block is legit. So either they'll all accept it or all deny it. Sometimes nodes break this consensus because a human changes the software to split off. But the only time this had any significant effect is when bitcoin cash did this. All the other times, the splits were ignored. So if you make a transaction, you can assume (almost) the whole network will agree on it.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:49:43
They would have to do a hard fork for that and all nodes that haven't switched to their code will reject it. Nobody other than those miners will consider their version to be bitcoin so they'll just end up creating an altcoin which probably won't even be listed on any major exchange.
Actually you don't need 51% of the hashing power to quadruple the mining reward. If you can code, you can do it by yourself. The problem is you'll be the only one who accepts your blocks. It's like writing "1 dollar" on pieces of paper. You can insist they're dollars and create as many as you want. But nobody is gonna accept your pieces of paper. Changing the mining reward is the same. You don't create bitcoin, you create a new chain that will be considered an altcoin.

Bitcoin is open-source, an option to create BTC out of thin air would be obvious.
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:01:21
Then you don't need to do anything. You will own the same amount of coins with the same private key on the new chain. If you want to spend them you need to import the key into a wallet of the new coin. Just make sure the wallet is real, because with bitcoin cash there were phishing sites pretending to be a BCH wallet to get your key.
Before spending on either chain after the split, you should send your coins on 1 of the chains to another address you own. You can do this at any time, as long as you do it before spending them. If they are still owned by the same adress when you spend on 1 chain, an attacker could generate the same transaction on the other chain. So when you send someone your bitcoin gold he could also take your bitcoin.

You shouldn't hold a bitcoin position on plus500 long-term. They charge an interest of 0.25% every day at a set time. You could close just before that time and open after to evade the interest, but then the spread would kill your profit. 0.25% doesn't sound like much but that makes 91.25% a year. You should only use Plus500 for trading.

I see no reason why taxes can’t be paid with bitcoin. The fiat system only makes wealth less equal with banks creating money out of thin air. It’s progressive taxes and social benefits that create a higher equality. Both are still possible with bitcoin.

On one side it would be bad for the euro and the Spanish and European stock market. That could be an incentive for more people to use Bitcoin as a currency and investment. On the other side it would lead to an economic crisis in Spain which might force Spanish hodlers to sell or spend their bitcoin to pay their bills.

If you destroy part of the guns and gun manufacturers, there are already a lot less guns and it will be harder for criminals to get one. You might be able to take some bitcoins out of circulation, but this wouldn't make it harder to get for example $100 in BTC because if you take out bitcoins, each bitcoin will be more valuable and you'll need less BTC to get the same value.

Almost is because Poloniex systems can fail like any exchange. But in Poloniex' history a default has never happened. If you're on poloniex, you see exchange, margin trading and lending on the top of the screen. You can offer coins at lending. The interest rates are daily.
If you want to take a loan, go to margin trading. If you go long on a coin, you borrow the base currency to buy it. If you short, you borrow the coin, sell it and later buy it back (cheaper) and repay your loan.
For example if you think the price of ETH will rise, you borrow BTC to buy ETH with it. If you think ETH will go down, you borrow ETH and sell it for BTC. To repay your loan you just need to buy back the ETH you borrowed and you'll hopefully have BTC left after that.
To lend, you need to move funds to your lending balance. To borrow you need to move funds to your margin balance. To do this go to balances &gt; transfer balances.

There are more people who think we should show bitcoin prices per mBTC instead of BTC. But I don't think the majority of exchanges will do this because most people oppose change. Their existing customers would not like if they start using mBTC while they're used to BTC.

BTC will fall when the split happens on the 1st of August, but you will also get BCH if you have a good wallet. I don't know if the price of BTC + BCH will be more than the current price of BTC.

You can use BitBay without verification below 15k euro. You can also deposit USD there. The prices are not always fair though, so you might want to compare them with a big exchange before buying. Otherwise you could also use localbitcoins, but again check the prices.

If the price is expected to rise, the lending rates should be lower because it is less attractive to short (borrow) BTC. And Poloniex protects lenders from default by closing borrowers' positions when they fall below the maintenance margin. It is almost impossible to not get your loan paid back on Poloniex.
The real reason is that the lenders only get paid back in BTC and not in BCH. So they lose money if they have open loans when the split happens.

He means that the user can be notified when there's a fast price change. Say your user asks to be notified when the price changes 2%. Now it doesn't matter if this happens in 10 minutes or 24 hours.
If users can set a timeframe, for example 1 hour, the bot will only notify them if the price changes 2% in 1 hour. To do this you need these rules:
timeframe = timeframe the user put in (for example 1 hour)
A = time at which the user made the request
B = current time - timeframe
if A &gt; B:
    base price = price at A
    base price = price at B
So basicly the base price is first set at the time of the request (like your current bot) but if this is longer than the timeframe ago, it is set to current time - timeframe. You have to first set it at time of request because otherwise it might give an alert instantly if the price changed 2% in the hour before the request. So you must only start counting after the request.

I don't know much about how much the Netherlands invests outside of my surrounding but I looked some stuff up for you. According to this:  the Netherlands are very friendly to bitcoin. I quote: "How can a country not be called Bitcoin-friendly when it boasts its own “Bitcoin City” i.e. Arnhem with over 100 merchants? Here, a Bitcoiner could probably get everything he wants including gas, accommodation, bicycles, and even dental services.
Cryptocurrencies are currently not regulated under the Act on Financial Supervision of the Netherlands, which is why numerous startups, Bitcoin ATMs and even a Bitcoin Embassy in the heart of Amsterdam have sprung up as a result. The climate has fostered vibrant Bitcoin communities across the country that host regular meet-ups and events.
Additionally, the country’s banking sector, including ABN Amro and ING, has been increasingly looking at Bitcoin and the blockchain as a way to improve their own technology and cut costs. The Netherlands is a regular host of Bitcoin conferences and Bitcoin companies such as BitPay."
And you can also have a look at the map of bitcoin venues. You see that the Netherlands and Flanders have a very high density of those: 
This suggests many people use bitcoin there.

Let's say the sum of both prices will be the same as the BTC price now. To make the math easy we'll say the value is gonna split 50-50 (which is not what will happen). This would mean the price of BTC would drop from 3000 to 1500. But BCC would also be 1500. This means that if you bought BTC for 3000 before the split, you would not make a loss. Sure, your BTC drop in value, but you'll get BCC in return.
That's why there is no need for BTC to drop in value now. You're basicly buying both BTC and BCC (as long as your exchange supports BCC or you take it to a good wallet).

A bull run is when the price goes up fast. Bullish means good, rising price, people buying. Bearish is the opposite: bad, falling price, people selling. A bull trap is a rise that seems good but is shortly followed by a fall, so people who bought in the bull trap are "trapped". A bear trap is the opposite: a short fall in which you might sell but then the price rises.

There are about 38 BILLION ripple in supply while there are only 16 million bitcoins. The market cap (total value) of ripple is very high as it ranks 3rd in market cap: 
Even judging coins by market cap is not a good way to go. Also consider if the coin has any potential. Find out if it has an advantage over other coins and if it has any use other than investing. Then compare that to the market cap and see if it's over- or undervalued. For now I'm most bullish on bitcoin because it has the biggest real-world economy and this economy can grow a lot more.

But only market cap is useful to see if a coin is priced high, right? Things like transaction volume and fees are just to see if a high cap is reasonable.

The price of BCH will probably be lower than BTC. Assuming the difficulty will still adjust to make an average of 10 minutes per block and the reward per block won't change, the income from BCH mining will be lower. That means BTC will get more hashrate than BCH.

3 hours ago actually. Look, just because they're down is no reason to panic. Also an exit scam would probably do more harm than good to them. They'd get quick cash but they lose the steady income from transaction fees. The BTC/USD pair alone had a volume of 422 million USD in the last 30 days. That means they got 844k in fees for that. And that's just 30 days BTC/USD.

If he actually bought bitcoin, I'd say that was a good decision. $1000 worth of bitcoin won't be anywhere close to a million in the near future though.
Cryp trade does not sell bitcoin though. That looks a lot like a ponzi scheme. They promise 215% ROI a year if you invest in them, guaranteed. A legit company could never guarantee such interest, no matter how good they are.
The affiliate program is not an affiliate program. You have to pay yourself before you can receive any commission. Also they do not provide proof that they actually trade or explain what their strategies are based on.
They claim "CRYP TRADE CAPITAL HOLDING SL is a registered British company that is unconditional guarantee for investors." That is a lie. That they're a registered company does not guarantee anything.
It is true that there is a company registered with this name: 
However the "nature of business" according the UK government is "Retail sale via mail order houses or via Internet", which is obviously not what they do. They have 3 people registered with the government. 2 are officers of the company and both are named "BADDY, Cryp", even though they're supposed to be different people. Another person, "Mr Cryp Baddy" owns 75% or more of the shares.
Their company registration is a joke. They didn't even try to make it look legit. If your friend invested in them, he has been scammed.

According to 21.co, your transaction should have a delay of 50-1080 minutes. So it's not fast, but your bitcoins should arrive.
Edit: This is an estimate, so it can be inaccurate. You can check the estimated delay at certain fees at

Bitcoin still has a block size limit. So does bitcoin cash, but they place the limit much higher. 
Bitcoin has an advantage though, it allows segwit transactions which makes transactions a bit smaller in bytes. Segwit is also required to make the lightning network work, which is a decentralized payment system on top of the blockchain and has instant transactions for very low fees. Lightning payments are made through a channel, which needs 1 on-chain transaction to open and 1 to close it, but between opening and closing the channel, infinite transactions can be made without any on-chain transactions. By passing on the transactions, anyone can pay anyone they have an indirect connection with, as long as there’s a route with enough funds in each channel. You can charge a little fee for passing on people’s transactions. This system is much more efficient than using on-chain transactions for each payment.
The reason for keeping block sizes low is that more people can run a node because there are lower bandwith and data storage requirements. More nodes means more decentralization.
Bitcoin core is an open source project so the code can be reviewed by anyone. If a dev would write a malicious update, the other devs and anyone who looks at the code, would reject it. Even if the devs conspired, nodes would simply choose to run the old code as soon as someone notices the problem and spreads the word.

Technically, there’s no primary and secondary chains. Just 2 completely seperate chains. Both clients will only know their chain as a valid chain. 
But yes, typically people will agree to give the chain with the smallest hash rate a new name.

I expect BTC to rise, which it has been doing since the low on May 27. But there will be some dips during the rise, of 100-200 EUR, which we have seen several of in the past days. So basicly a continuation of the current trend.
I think the current downward trend of ETH (which you predicted) will stop soon as we will reach the previous low of about 0.09 BTC, which is also a round number. I can't tell if it will go back up though.

Another piece of advice: Don't hold a lot of money on exchanges if you're not planning to trade it soon. If you are planning to pay out 10% of your profit every month, just keep a reserve on the exchange so you can sell your profits for a while. Keep the rest in a safe wallet because you're not gonna sell it soon anyway.

You're not gonna make much mining with a pc. If you want to earn a lot with mining, you'll need to buy specialised mining hardware. Pc's are just too ineffective to compete with that.
Consider the electricity costs you're paying to run your pc to calculate how much you're actually making (or losing).

It doesn’t work quite like that. A majority can’t force anything on a minority. If 51% want more than 21 million, and 49% keep the 21 million limit, then there will be 2 seperate chains. The fact that the 51% chain has a bit higher hash rate doesn’t help them.
A 51% majority is able to censor blocks if they keep mining the same chain, but if they change their rules, it will create a fork.

I manage funds for my friends and they also don't care about the results before they entered. They only gain confidence if the same results are made with their funds. They are pleasantly surprised if I make profit for them, even if statistics predicted that. And if they enter and it goes bad for a week, they think it's not gonna work, even though I made profit for half a year already.
This is kind of the same as what you told. Your friend doesn't care about the history of bitcoin, but only about that little bit of time he was in.

Yes, storing it in a wallet that supports the fork should get you both coins. You should read about replay attacks and how to prevent them though. And make sure you only spend coins on 1 of the chains when you want to make a transaction.
About Paypal, I have heard that they actually demand you to pay them back if they think you're a scammer. But I don't know if they can legally force you. Anyway, still be careful.

If you're just gonna hold and sell your profits, there's not much skill involved. So I don't see anything you could get the hang of. I would not advise you to invest that much in 1 asset though. Not only would it greatly suck if you lose, but you might also be more likely to lose because it will be harder to act rational with such an amount.
I advise you to start with an amount you're comfortable with and not to take all your profit out unless you invest it elsewhere. This would mean your capital/earnings won't grow. You could take like 10% of the profit out every month and leave the 90% to grow. Let's say you make 1% profit a day (very optimistic). If you invest 1k and take out all profits, you would have earned 3650 after a year. If you leave all profits in you would earn about 37k in a year. That's the power of compound interest. However I still advice to take that 10% out every month so you'll still have some of your profit if it goes bad.
If you invest an amount you're comfortable with, this would leave you with a lot of money left to invest. Maybe you want to invest in something not related to crypto too. If you want, we can discuss that in PM because we should stay bitcoin-related on this sub. If you just want to talk bitcoin, I can help you here.
