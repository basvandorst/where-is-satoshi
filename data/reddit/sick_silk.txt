If you look at the graph, the owner is splitting his/her funds at a very fast pace, don't know what he/she intends to do with such a split.

Considering those are the inputs:
... the algorithm will dig into this transaction only if one of the tracked address is part of the inputs, then if there's one it will follow the outputs. It's a simple discovery algorithm.
Stay tuned, I will upload something in the next days. I will ping you since you seem to be interested in this algorithm.
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:46:12
Surprisingly, the owner started selling on Binance when BTC was at it's lowest price in August 12th (and alts even lower), and then prices slowly increased while he was selling more and more BTC, so it seems to have 0 impact or buyers like that he is selling his coins "for cheap".
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:40:23
I am looking at transactions output lower than 100 BTC but I am not going to publish the exact algorithm here. 
Basically, I follow the flow of transactions, graph it for visual analysis instead of classical mapping. You can see patterns way faster that way. 
Considering that non-P2P exchange trading is not on-chain, we can only follow prior to the exchange or when the owner is mixing or selling in a P2P way. 
I don't believe this user is selling on P2P exchanges here because of the rate of transfers and the pattern of splitting big amounts in smaller chunks (you can see that on the graph with transactions red or yellow "bouquet").
This transaction for example is part of the graph and is a leaf: 
For your question about tumbling, if you split funds, whatever the tool you will use there will always be an output even if you mix it with other funds as inputs and if you transfer the funds from wallet to wallet. 
With Bitcoin there's always an input-output trace and again I don't care who is owning the funds, you will see the whale in the sea.

I am using a standard tree discovering algorithm by  tracking transactions linked to a previous tracked address : trx 1 (root) -&gt;  trx2 -&gt; ... -&gt; trx n (leaf)
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:38:17
Funds were not moving since 2014, so I don't believe this is a miner wallet. I am more interested in where are the funds going to end up.

Indeed those moves are really odd and if it's a sell out, it could impact the market hardly. I found very little activity on Bitmex but major transfers to Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:17:47
Those are documented online:  Some use Vanity address like Bitmex (3BMex).

I believe you don't understand what I am tracking here. I am tracking transactions originated from the 111,114-BTC wallet. I don't talk/care about its owner at all. I am tracking the funds since their original wallet independently from its owner. It's in my opinion worth following a 100 BTC transaction that comes out of the 100k BTC wallet to learn about the overall picture and where the funds are headed. I believe I have a pretty good knowledge of Bitcoin technology but I am opened to be proven wrong if you do so.
@_date: 2018-09-04 17:58:03
No, maybe you could do so and report your findings here?

I never said it was DPRs, I mentioned several hypothesis here, so which one is right for you: 
@_date: 2018-09-03 16:28:18
I don't think it's a hunt. It's just tracking transaction flow. I really don't care who this user is. Coins surely already transferred to other hands.
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:12:11
I hope that it is your option 2, slowly. Maybe the community can look at Bitfinex and Binance BTC trading and alert when major positions are opened.
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:35:12
First, is it "unacceptable" to discuss things in order to find the truth? I believe in open communication. And I don't think that a wallet of 111,114 BTC/BCH/etc while inactive  for the past 4.5 years is normal activity. It is legitimate to investigate this further, in my opinion.
Furthermore, I didn't *DECLARE* anything, I said [here]( that the most probable hypothesis was a wallet *RELATED* to SilkRoad due to this analysis: [
Other hypothesis are:






I think that you should read my analysis more carefully.

Some hypothesis:
- wallet's keys have been transferred to or found by a user
- user needs money
- user wants to erase traces
- user wants to buy alts
@_date: 2018-09-02 22:03:01
Thanks, I would say curiosity and hard work and online materials.
For the rest, I can track the owner's funds, but I cannot find out who he/she is.
Also if I am able to graph this, imagine what the FBI/CIA/NSA/... can do with their tools and brains...
So I think I am not really a threat to this owner, however I prefer staying Anonymous just in case :-)
And if I die (!!!), someone else will be able to continue the work, it's free.

No I am not following persons here or joining inputs, I am following transaction outputs of transaction inputs containing the tracked address. Owners could have changed on the way. Simple tree discovery.

It could also have been the perfect time for our owner to convert some of his bitcoins to alts coins since most of alts prices fell down against bitcoin and  were at their lowest August 14th. Just a thought.
@_date: 2018-09-02 19:34:31
I tracked Bitmex as well but "only" found 210 BTC transferred in with the following 6 major transactions .
Also, I have found 350 BTC transferred from Bitmex wallets though, maybe after being "washed out".

The timing is just strange to me. Selling at a BTC low while alts are even more bleeding.
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:13:05
I did some magic with three.js and graph discovery to export relevant data.
FYI, I found than more than 2980 BTC have been transferred to Binance wallet in August 2018, certainly to be sold or exchanged with other currencies, which represents 3% of the original wallet.
That's more than $20M worth of bitcoin at current price, it definitely can have impacted the overall price this month.
Most of it was sold after August 12th, which  corresponds to the start of an increase in Bitcoin price interestingly...

We need to build the same graph for the other coins, but in my post 2 days ago, I pointed the same activity on the BitcoinCash wallet: [
I agree that selling on Binance is odd but I think the owner is pretty confident and think that the way he is mixing his coins is sufficiently obfuscated. Proof here that it is not.
Despite I don't have all the data yet,  I can say that at least 88 BTC (which is a very minimal estimate) have been sent to Binance wallet in the last 24 hours, from addresses that are part of this graph:
