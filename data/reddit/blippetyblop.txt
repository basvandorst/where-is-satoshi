I don't know if you're referring to Bitcoin-24 or not but I lost a few grand when all of its assets were seized by the Polish and German authorities. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:32:29
That would be perfect if you knew the bottom and could guarantee it will move up. You can't know either, however. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:12:06
I'm sorry for your loss, mate. Personally; I don't see Bitcoin recovering any time soon so I would cut your losses and just sit on the money. If things change maybe you can jump back in at a lower point. That being said; I'm terrible at gambling in general and have been consistently puzzle by market moves.

Thanks for your responses. I have correspondence coming out of my ears so I can certainly provide screenshots of some of  it. It's mostly them telling me they are "investigating" or even in January that they "found my money" but then just an endless fob off from last November until right now. 
Nothing gets resolved and support seem like robots. I wish they'd just level with me one human to another. I'm sick of this endless run around.

I think it has to move one way or another once MtGox clears up and it's hard for me to envisage it moving up after the news out of China yesterday. That being said the price appears to be rebounding somewhat on Kraken. It went from a low of 600 EURO to 680 atm.

I have to agree. Having watched the video I have no reason to think it is fake and the fact that Simon doesn't satisfactorily address this is worrying. 
There's a chance that this whole thing is a ruse and the site is in fact broke. I myself transferred 1500 GBP and only received 1566 Euro, so he creamed some off of that. Perhaps to pay the deficit? Either way; this whole thing is incredibly fishy.

Yep. It's 15 dollars from my bank and 15 from theirs. I think I will start using bitcoin-24 as I believe they have lower rates.

It's not so much 'they' that are handling it well since the sole proprietor is a young man called Simon, who was incredibly naive and cost me thousands of dollars (not bitter - honest). The professionalism we see now is coming from his German Lawyers. Either way; I'm hopeful for a resolution. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 14:51:32
I think perhaps the biggest concern is not the corrupt trades but rather the German govt having the polish account frozen due to potential money laundering.

If anything comes from him, that will be it. More placatory words that we will gratefully gobble down because the reality is much less pleasant to face. 
He can't get the bank account open, thousands of BTC were stolen through the bug, and he is going to cut his losses and keep the BTC for himself because they are untraceable. 
It looks like complete delay tactics. He had everyone's trust a few days ago but the longer this goes on, the more and more implausible it appears to be. 
We have literally no confirmation of anything he has said. In fact - the lawyer that was attached to his businesses was called and had no idea about Bitcoin 24!

I understand your disagreement but I don't think the facts support your argument. 
The cornerstone of the BBC is its Charter that guarantees its independence and impartiality by law. 
Here's a link to it.
So while the BBC may have an internal bias (liberal and left wing) that is down to the culture of the institution rather than outside influence as it is not funded by the government and is therefore not beholden to it.
As for the Beeb being 'hated in the past', that's true, but it is also true for the present. It is continually in conflict with whatever government is in office.
As evidence to support this; here's David Cameron, 'the establishment' itself, calling the BBC stupid over their coverage of the Eastleigh by-election as recently as last month. If he had any kind of control over it that wouldn't be necessary. There are plenty of incidents of negative coverage of government action. That is just the latest.

Hi, thanks for responding. 
Have you heard about the bounty over on Bitcointalk? Nobody has claimed it yet which means nobody has seen a withdrawal since June 4th. 
I have my suspicions as to why, not all of them relating to the financial soundness of your business, but I'm curious what you have to say about it? 
@_date: 2013-07-18 00:04:30
I moved my cash to VirWox if anyone is interested. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 01:38:17
Because nobody can withdraw money so more people are buying rather than selling.

The industrial revolution was horrific for the poor and absolutely only benefited the industrialists. 
Adam Smith’s *The Wealth of Nations* was written just prior to the industrial revolution. This is an important point because it was the industrial revolution which completely rent asunder the fabric of English society and re-organised it into a class structure upon which industrial capitalism sat atop. Therefore at the very moment laisse faire theory was receiving its classical exposition, its premises were undermined.
The central premise, The Harmony of Interest as articulated by Smith, is a fallacy in the context of the modern world as it assumes people are not shut off from owning the means off production. Which they are. It was never meant for industrial capital. 
That's why taxes and labour laws and unions were introduced, as the previous poster mentioned, because of the absolute depredation of the working man during that time. Life was, quite frankly, horrid, and that is why the welfare state was created to mitigate some of the damage.
Incidentally; I'm from Manchester where it all began. We have a long history regarding this and that's why we in England recognise the need for a strong welfare state. As long as the system stays as it is it is completely necessary.
I understand this probably rubs up against the strong Libertarian vein that runs through these subreddits but there it is. I personally find Libertarianism a little naive and uniquely American. That is to say; borne of a unique experience and not one grounded in objective pan-global socioeconomic reality. 
One further point; you do have it backwards. Neo-Liberalism and deregulation is the watchword of global capital. Look at the IMF.

@_date: 2013-04-02 23:30:50
Of course, why argue the facts when you can just make nonsensical assertions like that?
I don't know what kind of school you went to but that is certainly not something you learn in any state school over here. The UK government is naturally proud of the Industrial Revolution as the springboard of prosperity. In combination with the industrialists that control them they actively promote its benefits through the school curriculum.  
Furthermore I'm shocked that you think one shouldn't listen to economists or historians, the two professions uniquely qualified to speak about this subject. I have a feeling this is why you're so mixed up. I don't know what secret knowledge you think you have but again, you're naive if you don't think it has its own bias.
You're right about one thing though; I did study hard. I would recommend you do the same, although I don't mean an endless feedback loop of Libertarian blogs and the Alex Jones show.

If it was going to crash out, that was the time. Both the Americans and Europeans have sold off what they would and the price is still $150 as of writing. I think it will rise slowly and cautiously as people feel it out for the next week or so. Terrible publicity though.

It is highly unlikely that the account will be unfrozen. The govt thinks there is money laundering going on, and quite rightly so. The only way for Simon to pay us all back now is to sell his BTC or give them to us in exchange of the cash. He has the Bitcoin available to do that. He won't like the idea, naturally, but there may be no option for him.
