YES it is. Here are some papers that refers to many "consensus algorithms" including PoW, PoS and others.
Fix your bitcoin knowledge.

Ok, but what if a 51% attack is done using a soft fork? Let's say a 51% or higher miner uses a soft fork to change the rules such that every block is empty and all transactions are validated through an extension block the merkel root of which is embedded in the coinbase transaction. This way the effective block size is increased without the full node's consent.
This way all old nodes will blindly follow and will no longer be able to spend their funds unless they upgraded to the new soft fork rules. 
So how does running a full node protect against that?

* The block reward could either be based on the block height as per usual or on the extension block, it doesn't really matter. The extension block can have its own coinbase to collect transaction fees.


* When miners spend these transactions they will be included only into the extension block. So in effect old nodes will only see empty blocks and will not be able to make any transactions unless they upgrade to the new node. 
* So the point of this attack is to show how a 51% miner could force people into following new rules and how running a full node wont help to stop them.

The nodes will follow the longest chain, which will be under control of the 51% miner. So it does not matter what the 49% of miners do. In this scenario all blocks produced are valid. Therefore if someone wants to make a transaction they will need to upgrade their node to one that supports extension blocks.

The blocks are completely backwards compatible. No change has been done to the consensus rules. The old nodes will just not see the extension block but rather just empty blocks. Therefore they will need to upgrade their nodes in order to make any transactions.

Yes, exactly. But to my knowledge that is the only attack vector that can be used against SPV nodes as well. I am not aware of another attack vector that a full node is protected against that an SPV node isn't. If you could give me an example that would be great.
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:42:17
Thanks for the info. But from my understanding, isn't checking the cumulative work the only way to verify you are on the correct chain? I am not aware of another more secure way to verify you are on the correct chain.

* The block reward could be changed, but the point of the attack is to force nodes to upgrade to a newer client that supports extension blocks and thus effectively increasing the block limit. The block reward could be changed but so can any consensus rule. If the miners also choose to increase the block reward, then it is less likely the nodes will agree to that in addition to already being forced to support extension blocks.


* The coinbase transaction will still be on the base block, it will just either be 0 or 1 satoshi, (I am not sure which one is necessary in order to keep with the consensus rules). The block reward however can be moved to the extension block. 


* Yes, but since no hard fork took place then the nodes will follow the longest chain, which will be mined by the 51%. 


* The point of this attack is to deny any transactions from taking place for old nodes and force them to upgrade. So if old nodes just "hodl" they are essentially just denying themselves from making transactions. The point of the bitcoin network is to be able to make transactions.

But why is it not enough for big businesses and miners to run full nodes and for users to use SPVs? A miner can't cheat the network unless they have 51%, and if that were to happen there is nothing a full node can do anyways.
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:48:15
What other method is more reliable than looking at the total chain work? And what does a pruned node know that an SPV doesn't when it comes to which chain to follow?
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:34:04
What added security does running a pruned node over an SVP? They both verify they are on the correct chain by looking for the chain with the greatest total chain work. So how does an average user benefit by downloading the entire latest block?
@_date: 2018-06-02 21:07:59
but surely chain work is the only thing you cannot fake on the btc network. Because it is the hash rate x the hashing time of the SHA256D algorithm, which you cannot fake because of PoW. I don't see how you could verify you are on the correct chain any other way.
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:42:06
This is a 51% attack. Therefore the attacker will have the longest chain and thus the longest chain. Therefore all nodes will follow the attackers chain and they will only see empty blocks. Therefore this is an attack. Because users will not be able to make any transactions unless they upgrade their node to one that can see the extension blocks.
The point of this hypothetical attack is to show how running a full node does not protect you against a 51% attack.

If people could elaborate in the comments as to why they voted the way they did, it would be greatly appreciated :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:27:18
No it's not. There are many types of consensus algorithms. SHA256D is the one bitcoin is using. I'm asking if people would like to see it changed or not.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:21:14
consensus algorithm*

I miss the good old days where people didn't hate miners and realised how important they are to how bitcoin works...
