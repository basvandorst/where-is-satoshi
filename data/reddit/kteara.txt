where do you purchase? I want to find somewhere that is more cost-effective than coinbase with its' fees.
@_date: 2016-06-28 16:35:15
Why is that? what makes you think it will fall the day after the halvning?
What is your current BTC investment strategy?

This seems good for freelancers who get paid by international clients.
However someone like me who works for e.g. a car dealership company in the UK, would it be better to just buy btc every month when I am paid?
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:42:07
Say that about gold or silver as well then.
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:40:46
This guy has a logical point

What do you advise to be the best route of making the most profit... Investing 300-500 everymonth into bitcoins via coinbase or wait and save up lets say 2-3k and buy as many bitcoins as its worth then?
@_date: 2016-06-27 12:55:30
Sorry if off-topic, which site has lower fees or is better to purchase BTC from? Coinbase or Localbitcoins?
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:09:10
By that do you mean using coinbase is not the best way of going about aquiring btc?
I have just bought £10 worth (first try) and it cost me I think £0.29 fee... when I look at my wallet now it says my BTC value is £9.57 ? this is a loss? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:59:49
DON'T DO IT!
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:29:25
This is what has made me want to purchase bitcoins as I view it as a commodity. I am however unable to work for bitcoins I can only get paid in fiat. Do you think it would be unwise to transfer all my fiat earnings into bitcoins when I get paid each month?
@_date: 2016-06-28 16:31:33
Buy BTC today or wait until tomorrow/day after?
@_date: 2016-06-28 18:02:47
Where do you purchase your bitcoins from, I use coinbase but I am a little unhappy with the fees involved. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:53:17
1) I do not understand by what you mean as a banksters tool and how this will effect me?
2) By invest I meant purchasing BTC, saving it for 10-20+ years then selling for a profit
3) I live in London,UK, I have never heard of an employer paying in BTC.
5) could you elaborate further?

Thanks I actually made this new post in relation to a previous post-reply you had made to me.
Lets say I cannot do freelance work but instead want to invest £300-£500 a month into purchasing bitcoins from a site such a coinbase, with the aim of holding it for as long as possible to sell at a future date (10 years time) for a profitable return... What are your thoughts on this?

Can someone ELI5? I would jump at the chance to purchase 1600BTC for 604USD
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:33:23
so when would be the best time to buy ? in your opinion please? thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:08:45
How much is the question? I hope my $1000 investment doesn't vanish into thin air
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:07:31
Well, fingers crossed $1000 investment doesn't vanish into thin air in the future
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:44:57
can you explain sorry didnt make sense to me?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:02:47
Well, I don't see how $100 would give me significant profit if you put it that way as that is the maximum amount I'd be okay with losing forever. :\
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:31:37
would you advise me to buy a bitcoin now given its extremely high price of $1000 ? I myself am in love with the idea that I could potentially retire with this investment or is it too good to be true? What would you do?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:13:22
How much are you planning on buying and how long do you aim to hold onto them for in terms of investment?
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:23:01
what effect will this have? Can I make a huge profit if I buy a BTC at a ridiculous price of $1000 over the next few years?
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:35:30
Well I am thinking is it not better to wait for a drop in price to purchase? or do people generally believe it will be a uphill slope from here on out?
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:40:28
would you say its too late to purchase 1 Btc or should I wait for a drop to purchase it? I understand you don't know for sure but in your position what would you do? thanks.

Are you planning on holding BTC as a long term investment or short term? If I may ask?..
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:28:34
I would make jack shit if i did it that way
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:20:49
will you be investing in bitcoin? I want your opinion on wether it could be a wise decision to buy 1 BTC with the aim of having it as a long term investment ?
