WARNING: I bought 2 opendimes products almost a year ago now. For some reason or another their shipping company didn't deliver the product and it was returned to them. I contacted Opendime and they would not reship unless I paid an additional $30 (my local UPS store quoted me $7) and they wouldn't give me a refund either.
Now I'm stuck with no product and no refund. Terrible customer service, maybe even fraud (no product delivered and no refund, essentially stole my money)

You probably dont understand how a bank works. The accounting is very different. Cash/money that youve deposited is actually a liability to them and when they give out loans those are considered assets on the balance sheet. A bank with $100,000,000 in loans will show $100,000,000 in assets even though its not gaurenteed those loans will get paid back. Also the less deposits ($$) they have the less liabilities they will have. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 05:53:03
You're still missing the point. Creating a loan out of nowhere (lets pretend a 10% reserve on fractional banking) is not a true asset. A bank could easily pump its balance sheet by adding $1,000,000,000 in loans to people that can't pay it back (eg subprime loans). Banks don't have to have shiny rocks eg houses, gold, stocks, bonds etc in order to have a huge "asset" column on their balance sheet. Actually the more loan exposure they have (whether they are good or bad loans) makes their balance sheets look stronger until you realize its all a facade (eg the 2008 MBS bubble popping which made all of these "amazing balance sheet" banks almost go bankrupt).

Force a special character in there (which the protocol can't handle) and suddenly you have invalid addresses....I think.
Either way though for all practical purposes burn addresses take away from "live" coins in that if someone could eventually brute force (not possible) the private key for it bitcoin would become useless.

@_date: 2015-12-17 06:06:46
It would seem that they would need a way to prove that all of their data does indeed create the checksum that is recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, otherwise people are just taking their word that they match up. They would need to have 100% open books for this to work. 
For example they could originally write data like 1 + 1 = 2. 2 is the checksum and they write 2 to the bitcoin blockchain. 1 week later they alter their data so that they actually have 3 + 1 and they just keep "2" on the bitcoin blockchain. No one would know unless they had their data subpoena'd. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:14:27
Like I said I've always had a good experience with them too. But now why a 30+ day wait PLUS a disconnected phone line PLUS no answer to email PLUS to answer to contact form....as of right now it is impossible to communicate with them.

The data they time stamp (checksum) would need to include the transfer of what equity, the number of shares and from whom and who the receiving party is (or psuedonyms of accounts). Otherwise any of that data could be forged post publication of checksum on blockchain.

@_date: 2014-07-29 07:24:29
The extrapolations that I was interested either used a log price vs time with linear regression OR they used bubble wedges with time blocks in between. Of those two trend types the predictions were correct and that is why people usually state about ~245 days between bubbles. I broke mine down a little further by showing the time frame from bubble to stability and the time period between those two, which puts the timeframe closer to 245-275 days per cycle. I'm not talking about any troll posts or people that only look at the past 1-2 months and plot some high/low/average linear regressions over a very small time period (IE 1-2 months) and call it a day.

That's not what it seems to be, it is neither bullish or bearish, just standard taxation rules. If you purchase taxable goods with bitcoin, the purchaser will still have to pay sales tax (based on the USD value of the coins at that time), BUT the retailer won't have to pay sales tax on the bitcoin that they technically just "bought" with their goods.
If you use bitcoin to purchase a non-sales tax item, such as c++ source/code in NY, then there is no tax for either party. But there are very limited number of goods and services that aren't taxed in NY.
From the NY Tax paper: "Example 1:
An online retailer
ered for New York State sales tax purposes
convertible virtual currency from a customer as payment for home décor items that will
be delivered to
the customer’s location in New
York State. In effect, the customer has
purchased the home décor items
in exchange for the convertible virtual currency, and the
retailer has purchased the convertible virtual currency in exchange for the home décor
Because home décor items are taxable, the customer owes sales tax based on the taxable
for the
purchase of the items.
The taxable receipt is the
market value of the
convertible virtual currency in U.S. dollars at the time of the transaction. However,
because convertible virtual currency is intangible property, the retailer does not owe any
s tax on its exchange of home décor items for the convertible virtual currency."

“There is an opportunity to recreate the financial world as we know it in the parallel universe that is the blockchain,” Byrne tells WIRED, referring to the online public ledger that keeps track of all bitcoin transactions. “We are writing rules for this whole new universe.” --Very exciting. I really think this should be built directly on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to ensure that miners will keep this new decentralized wall street alive and running well, otherwise it will require a new set of miners on a different algorithm and with a smaller population of people verifying transaction the greater the risk for manipulation.
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:38:43
That is not what this regulation states. Basically it is only stating 2 things in regards to bitcoin taxation.
1) If you buy a taxable good or service (almost anything) with bitcoin, the buyer will need to pay a sales tax, but the seller will not have to pay a sales tax  on the bitcoins that they technically just "bought" with their goods (but they will still need to pay a capital gains tax at the end of the year)
2) If you are purchasing a non-taxable good or service (IE c++ code in NY) then no one is taxed on the sale. There are very, very few non-taxable goods/services in america.

Well it would be 214 days + 31-59 days, which would land on 8/1/2014. There is no way I could say "the price of bitcoin will boom on 8/1/2014 at 12pm eastern standard time", that would be an absurd claim. What I am predicting however, is that the next Bitcoin boom will happen very, very soon. I expect it to increase quite significantly in the next 30 days. Could I be wrong? Sure. My claims are based on Bitcoin price history and applying those trends in a systematic matter.

Just buy from the ATM, then scan the private wallet and sweep it into your favorite bitcoin wallet.

Well not only will Lighthouse have the centralized way of using bitcoin to kickstart a business etc, but there is also be the decentralized method via the block chain to collect bitcoins for a kickstarter...and the special way it will be done, per the Lighthouse creator, is through a method that the block chain will only recognize the coins if the sum of the coins meets the minimum start up requirement.

Capital gains tax is usually cheaper than having to pay the IRS income tax, so keeping bitcoin classified as an asset is better for taxation purposes. Sales tax will still occur for the buyer for most purchases with bitcoin, they are simply clarifying that the person receiving the bitcoin, who technically just "bought" bitcoin with their goods, doesn't have to pay sales tax as well (which never happens with cash either).

Everything in NY has been about making bitcoin *companies* follow all the standard MSB laws that exist for other currencies. Yes NY was too inclusive about what *companies* needed a MSB: Bitlicense, but that is being taken out of the Bitlicense and has nothing to do with taxation.

1. Trading of predetermined values in a signed commitment: Maybe useful for creating a derivative market or escrow services within the bitcoin protocol itself.
2. Verification that two sets of data (or files) are identical without any changes: Can create tamper-evident logs in everything
3. Digital Signatures: For identification purposes (think passports, employee badges with access to doors, driver's licenses, website logins and also "private" identities that are not linked to real world identities etc).
Those are just a few ideas from 1 of his lectures. He has lots of ideas and is well versed on what bitcoins full potential could really be beyond that of just being used as a means to transfer value (which is also great).

As the coupon rates become lower, the value of the bond increases, just like you said they are inversely related. Investors are buying bonds now in expectation that interest rates will continue to decrease long term and thus increase the value of their current bonds.
If investors thought long term interest rates were going to increase, it would be foolish to buy bonds now knowing that their bonds will be worth less as soon as rates started increasing, in which case it would have been better to just hold "cash". (the Fed is not very likely to have any significant sustained rate hikes without popping this whole bubble).

On Coinbase you link your checking and credit card. Purchases with credit card are instant and cost 3%. If you instead purchase with your bank account you get the current Bitcoin rate but you just have to wait a week as that is how slow the legacy financial system is to clear the transaction. Fees for bank account are 1%. Either way you lock in the current USD/BTC rate, it doesn't change while you wait for the transaction to complete.

@_date: 2017-01-31 08:13:19


Actually this IS the case. Even buying a negative yielding debt now can be sold later for a higher price when debt yields become even more negative. This is the case with many low and negative yielding bonds that already exist today. Buying a risky low/negative yielding bond just because people will pay a higher price later when yields are more negative is very similar to the irrational purchases of real estate in 2004-2007.

That is incorrect. Most sellers are charging 55,000-59,000 INR, which is between $810-$870. That one seller that you linked states that the final INR/BTC price is "floating" meaning that once you initiate the deal they will bump it up to the actual going rate
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:38:48
Chargebacks are a huge liability for online stores. Online fraud is rampant. A store with a good reputation (eg amazon stocked goods) could allow for Bitcoin payments with a discount (since fraud goes to 0% for them) and you would not have to worry about being scammed since it is a well established company. 
For peer to peer purchases, after I have been screwed multiple times via paypal and ebay, I now ONLY accept Bitcoin/Monero payments. Too many fraudsters and it's only going to get worse.

@_date: 2016-12-28 02:03:42
Wealth and easy of use/comfort aren't necessarily the same. If there are no light bulbs at all in the world then they are no longer in the wealth calculation. Rather the value of candles goes up and so does the wealth of people that own/make candles. Thus a transfer of wealth occurs from people that had light bulbs, now to people that own/make candles. I'm not 100% firm on the phrase that "wealth is never destroyed, just transfered", but I can see their point.

1. First, with BTC, it is my understanding that the blockchain is very inefficient, has slow transition times, and small block sizes. Why is this okay?
A. Bitcoin is a money and it is more important to have a non-inflatable, non-controllable money that it is to do payments. The USD and Visa etc already do fast payments, the trade off is that you have inflation, massive money printing and continued devaluation of that currency and it is not a store of value. 1st priority is a store of value, that is where Bitcoin comes in. Payments will be solved on second/third layers. 
Small blocks are important and key to Bitcoin's success. For Bitcoin to be able to be validated by individuals the blocks have to remain small. If you have large blocks and require data centers, third parties or larger servers to validate the transactions (e.g. ethereum), it becomes centralized and USD 2.0, which is a reversion to the old system.
2. Second, with BTC, it is my understanding that china controls over half of the BTC mining power, and that China could essentially destroy the blockchain at any time. Why is this wrong?
A. There is indeed a lot of mining power in China. With time miners will locate to the places with the cheapest electricity. If miners co-opted against Bitcoin would we simply code around them. We have a miner kill-switch (the mining algorithm). Miners serve Bitcoin users, it is not the other way around. Look at the history of Segwit2X and how the users went against major bitcoin companies and miners to build the system that we wanted (segwit with no 2x in block size) instead of what the miners wanted. 
3. Finally, with BTC, it is my understanding that people pool computing power together and these groups can solve multiple blocks in a row. Why is this okay?
A. Mining pools help small miners aggregate their mining power to solve blocks. This way they can claim smaller rewards (e.g. 0.03 bitcoin per day) instead of hoping they solve for a block reward on their own, which might otherwise take them years to do (or never). There is a trade off of centralizing this mining power in a pool, however if pools make poor choices or attack the network miners could leave that pool. If the pool attempts to make invalid blocks, it wastes their own resources and thus is discouraged purely from an economic incentive perspective. 
Altcoins: Many altcoins can process transactions faster than bitcoin, but that does not mean that they are more secure. IF their blockchain has low mining power (which they almost all do), a bigger player can reorganize their blocks and reverse transactions. Once again payments is not the innovation with cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. The innovation is with digital scarcity and creating a hard money that cannot be devalued or censored. If you want fast payments use the USD and Visa. Bitcoin can solve payments later with layer 2/3 solutions such as lightning network. Payments is a much easier problem to solve than a reliable, decentralized, censorship resistant store of value is. 
XRP is a corporate coin. It is not decentralized nor censorship resistant. It is important to remember that store of value, censorship resistance and the ability to verify your own transactions are the key innovations of Bitcoin. Payments is easy.
Finally, why is BTC the reference? See all previous answers. In regards to "stablecoins" do you know of any fiat money that it stable? Do they not all go down in purchasing power over time? Bitcoin cannot be inflated to worthlessness like fiat and stablecoins that are based on fiat. 
The key to all of this is Bitcoin is a decentralized, store of value, it cannot be stopped, it cannot be printed to worthlessness, it cannot be held hostage by corporations or miners. It is money by the people for the people. This digital scarcity is the innovation that Satoshi brought to us. Payments is a much easier problem to solve.

Trezor had stated that supporting BCH was very difficult, and that was WITH replay protection. I honestly don't think they will mess with S2X as their is no replay protection with it.
With that being said as long as you control the private keys (which you do with Trezor) the community will eventually come up with an easy enough way for non-tech people to do it (likely a S2X post-fork mixing and then splitting your coins)

With Mycelium you will have access to your private keys. As of right now there is no replay protection for S2X fork, so if you move your coins on one chain, the coins will move on both chains. Best thing to do is to be patient after the fork and see how things play out. 
This is a different ball game in terms of risks of trying to sell S2X coins while not losing your Bitcoin (as compared to BCH, which was protected from this problem), don't let greed of trying to sell the S2X lead you to lose your bitcoin.

You are not owed anything. Coinbase will likely pick one fork to stay with and only conduct business on that fork. S2X has no replay protection so once they start moving coins they will likely be replayed on both forks at first, which means they won't have enough coins on one of the forks to give to people later.
If you want to sell one of the forked coins you should own your private keys.

Introduction to Russian criminal liability for the exchange of Bitcoin will stop the development of promising technologies blockchain in the country and the regression as a whole. This opinion was expressed by Chairman of the Board of Sberbank, the former Economic Development Minister German Gref said in a speech at the business school "Skolkovo". This Saturday, May 21 sobschaet RIA Novosti .
«Blockchain - in my opinion, is a new web, the idea of ​​the same level as the Internet, and it has not yet been born - our regulator said that cryptocurrency - do not let the Lord God can not produce, then they said that they can not buy and now they say that those who are trying to buy them, we still put him in jail, "- said Gref.
If this happens, the "all progress goes beyond the limits of the Russian Federation", said the head of Sberbank. In his opinion, all the experts in the field of technology blockchain will be forced to move their activities in a more "user-friendly" jurisdiction of the country, the country that have established special conditions for the involvement of professionals in the field.
Also during his speech, he stated that the money issue and the nationalization of the Russian economy have led to "disastrous results." "We in the history persists in repeating the same steps. And now we hear, "let's try to issue money," which will not cause somehow we have inflation, "let's - the state's economy because private business does not operate in the country." All this was led to disastrous results. We need to learn from our own history ", - quotes the head of Sberbank words TASS .

And the amount of public funds allocated for investment growth should be at least 1.5 trillion rubles annually.

The way I look at it is this. Right now 1.5 million dollars of bitcoin are either bought or horded by miners every day, which keeps the price stable around $440 (440x3600 bitcoins/day). If there continues to be 1.5 million dollars of effective bitcoin buying a day and now there is only 1800 bitcoins created a day the cost of each Bitcoin is then $880 (double). However! You have to remember that  price increases leads to media attention which leads to further purchasing (and NEW purchasers) which then leads to further price increases...rinse and repeat. This is largely how bubbles are created. 
If the price goes over $1000-1200 again expect mass media and mass FOMO.
That is all.

Anyone have the link to that gif/short video of an astronaut riding a rocket to space with a Bitcoin symbol on his back?

Can you please link to the BIP148 node software in your OP?

Command line is very simple. 
/transfer 3 Monero-Address Amount-of-Monero  
Pretty simple for anyone that wants true anonymity....

Using MyMonero is optional. I'd suggest just downloading the core wallet, much like you would for any other coin...especially if privacy is a concern.

Can someone please link me the source for this "blockchain shares" thing? I'm guessing some media source didn't have a clue what bitcoin is?

In order to sweep the funds from an address you had to show blockchain.info the private key. If blockchain.info were to get hacked or any of its on page services got hacked they could steal your plaintext password. Do not consider it as safe as offline bitcoins or even bitcoins on your own PC that you dont download stupid programs to.

If I'm paid in Bitcoin I don't have to worry about chargebacks.

What happens is people steal credit cards and make fraudulent purchases. They recieve the product and then the rightful owner of the card reverses the unauthorized payment. The store looses this money and thus prices are marked up higher to account for the fraud rate they encounter.

You can create other coins by forking., but not more Bitcoin.

If I'm paid in Bitcoin I don't have to worry about chargebacks. Don't have to worry about a payment processor reversing anything.

I haven't seen Goat in a very long time. Please show me how you know this was goat. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:51:18
There are plenty of people with $500 in BTC, that's nothing for a ton of people. There are plenty of reasons why someone would impersonate goat, none of which I will discuss.
