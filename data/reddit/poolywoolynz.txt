So I guess you'd connect to something equivalent to an ISP (respected node), which has a large amount of connections to others to ensure that your payment will always be routed?
Whose going to run these respected nodes, and will they make any profit? 
Will the software be able to eventually automatically choose a respected node to connect to, or do we need to search one out first?
Is the respected node like a server that needs to be online always?

Yeah, in the end the said that my business was "too high risk" (selling electronic test components, despite the fact that there are already other businesses selling the same things and using Bitpay). So they closed my account permanently and sent the bitcoins from previous orders to my address...
I asked them for the exact policies regarding my ban, but they weren't able to provide any. Basically it's all based on how the compliance officer is feeling that day. From doing more research it seems that they are very censorship happy, and not particularly organized so I wouldn't recommend doing business with them.

Yeah I'm only expecting about 1-2 sales a week with bitcoin so was hoping to not need to spend so much time figuring out how to run my own wallet. Seems my shopping cart software only supports bitpay anyway, so i'll need to petition them to support alternatives.

Yikes, that's pretty despicable. I had no idea BitPay was so bad. I was researching them before and it seems that they're actually winding down their payment processing activities and going more into technical services.
Are there any payment processor alternatives that aren't so restrictive? Coinbase?
