hey guys, is segwit2x and btc1 the same thing?
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:53:01
as is btc atm, i pretty much agree with you. btc was created to be used as a peer to peer payment but as of now its pretty much unusable.
but the lightning network should fix this right?

the manipulation on the price of bch seems unreal. ton of 0.001 bids and asks to drive the price up and down. Also huge orders appearing and disappearing in seconds.
what r ur thoughts on this guys?
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:16:33
yeah IOTA,Monero,Dash,Zcash. All these atm seem way better than overpriced BTC.
i am more than happy to listen to the opinions of people that are downvoting me

yeah and cause bitcoin is like a dial up back in the day, another coin will come to de-throne btc.
btc was created to be a peer to peer payment. And seems to me that it failed. Tx fees are similar to banks, making micro tx unusable.
So to me seems that btc is an overvalued hyped coin that at the moment doesnt serve the purpose that it was created for but rather to make richer in $ some individuals.
I really hope for a better crypto future :)
Ps: seeing threads on here that are getting deleted just because they dont praise BTC or arent moon memes is just sad.
A lot of people that are interested in crypto and especially in btc or bch, will be browsing at both subreddits(bitcoin and btc) and when they notice the cencorship that happens here, it will automatically drive them off.
get ur shit together!
