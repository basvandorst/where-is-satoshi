I'm fairly certain.  When I put a list of possible passphrases into pywallet for the recovery the passphrase I believed it was gets the most .....
In the recovery process it doesn't mention encrypted_privkey, only when I dump the recovered wallet file as it doesn't let me make an unencrypted wallet to dump into.  Upon recovery finishing it comes up with "The new wallet /path contains the 528 recovered keys."
Edit to add: During the recovery process, the Privkey (Bitcoin) address listed matches up with the 'sec' field in the JSON dump

Instead of sweeping the keys, I created a new wallet, added in the full list of private keys which took the program some time to process, then it opened with the full balance :)
Thanks for the help

That's where I'm stumped.  I was expecting the output to be address, private key and public key, instead I get the following (Data removed for obvious reasons):
            "addr": "", 
            "compressed": true, 
            "encrypted_privkey": "", 
            "hexsec": "", 
            "label": "recovered: ", 
            "pubkey": "", 
            "reserve": 0, 
            "sec": "", 
            "secret": ""
        }, 
Only the sec field is accepted into sweep and when I paste them all in I get either "unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'NoneType' and 'int'" or "No inputs found. (Note that inputs need to be confirmed)". When I copy all the addr into a 'watching wallet' it indicates my balance that was around what I expected but I still don't know how to access them.  I haven't used Electrum before (Usually run full core) so I am not very familiar with it, and I don't want to manually try every key in core so I apologise if this seems a little basic.  I will tip whomever helps me to get my wallet back though!
