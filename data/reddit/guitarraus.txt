Lol. What are you talking about? Where have I ever said I think bitcoin cash is going to be the worldwide decentralised currency? Just because I say bitcoin isn't a currency that somehow means I'm a bch maximalist? Non sequitur much...
For the record I don't think any form of blockchain protocol is suitable as a worldwide, mainstream, decentralised currency. The scaling issues are far too great no matter the bandaids that people come up with.

What's Btrash? I'm talking about bitcoin, whatever you're talking about is irrelevant.

When lighting comes we can reassess whether bitcoin is a currency. As of now, it is not.

I'm really failing to see how what you're saying relates to bitcoin being or not being a currency. That's all I'm trying to talk about here and you're talking about completely irrelevant things.

Whenever I see complaints about high fees the rebuttal is always that bitcoin is just a store of value. And that makes sense, because why no other currency has fees so large.

Isn't bitcoin just a store of value?

Lol. Dude. You realise the people who ACTUALLY built bitcoin, like Gavin Andresen, were forced out of bitcoin by the toxicity of Core? 
Core are the ones who have attached themselves like a parasite to what was a world changing project. They bullied away the visionaries in order to push Blockstream's corporate profit model.

In what world do works in progress function well at the start and progressively get worse over time? That's the opposite of progress.

Err, am Australian. We have unlimited data plans, and we have 4g. Our speeds do suck generally, but if you're lucky and live in the right areas then you're fine.

Username checks out. Stereotype does not. ;)
