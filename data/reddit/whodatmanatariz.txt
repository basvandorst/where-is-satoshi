If you believe in bitcoin, wouldn't you be dumb not to own some? And I almost feel it's your duty to spread awareness - not for gains, but for freedom. He understands what it is, and he understands what it can do for the people. Based on the few videos I've watched of this guy, I would instantly vote for him to be president given the opportunity.

Don't forget they also charge you and other vendors fees as well, probably more so than the cost of btc.

I'm more curious about the size differential in this fight - is this a joke? Or did that actually happen in old MMA days? I had seen some big size discrepancies, but normally it was a small ground person vs a large standing fighter.

Exactly, it was know that this would happen simply by the design of FIAT - I'm convinced it was never meant to last, and that it was just a vehicle for wealth confiscation.

Bitcoin and crypto alike offer an alternative to the system as we know it. Today, money = trust, however we trust a system run by men, and men make mistakes. Bitcoin offers a trustless system/store of value - and when the most valuable thing about money is trust, people will eventually adopt bitcoin (or something similar) since it's superior to a trust based system. Bitcoin solves the trustless store of value problem on a global scale for the first time (or what will be a global scale), where it isn't owned or controlled by a government or country. The issue is most people don't realize or understand that, or know what money really is - they just aimlessly accept and trust the system they are in. Over time I think people will begin to see it, and that's when real adoption will kick in.

Potentially, but it might not be legit. Since you can re-seed it and it would probably be okay if it's legit, but why risk it over a few dollars since it will be protecting your wealth in the long run?
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:09:56
That, plus the last crash was caused by a whale attempting to kill/profit from the long positions, now they will buy back and kill the short positions they caused by crashing and killing the bull sentiment in a lot of people. I'm still bullish myself, and I'm sure they want to regain their position.

Adoption, however someone has quite the power out there. Pretty sure it was 68xx when I got on my bus, now 63xx. Someone is definitely making some huge money right now. I'm sure it will recover, but they seem to keep hitting it. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 05:09:05
I don't think now is the greatest time to sell, but if you're so worried about it, why not sell half and hodl half? Your profits still give you a massive return, and then you can hodl like a champ and wait until everyone else is talking about it and the price is exploding (instead of looking at it frequently). Profits would pay for a good chunk of your schooling, and then you would only be upset about selling half instead of all in the future (unless it fails, which I highly doubt). But if that much money isn't a big deal, is there really a reason to sell? Future highs could be life changing with a few coins.

Did you rob someone or something? Why don't you know what it's for? 
@_date: 2018-09-07 00:57:47
I'll only sell at unsustainable levels given the current ennvironment and economy, like last winter, and I'll do so to make some money and position myself for a buy down the road. Other than that, HODL and slowly acquire more near the lows. (Not that my miniscule volume makes a dent, but at least that strategy worked well this time around). That all said, I never liquidate 100% unless I'm playing alt coins I don't fully believe in. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 20:43:36

Officially jealous. I wanted to mine at  .32, but I was too focused on the tech to buy it, which I really regret, even though I only had a few hundred dollars to my name then (had a massively terrible computer - would get 2fps on the lowest settings in WoW)
Researched mining again at the 170 range before the 2013 pump, and again didn't buy since I was focused on the tech side of things and couldn't afford to mine. 
Again, before the last boom, decided to mine and not buy. This time I went all out and leveraged my 401k since I was tired of missing out on something I had really liked back in 2009. Made some decent money since I got in early on the L3+'s, but would have pulled 10 fold just buying. (Sold most of what I had in BTC late dec/early Jan, and have been trying to accumulate some over the last 2-3 montbys)
If you bought and didn't mine that 6+ years ago, hats off to you - need more strong hands. Also jealous of your future riches lol. I had the same feeling about ZEC as BTC way back, so I got in on the GPU mining a bit, but still would have been best off just buying.

Pretty sure their study was poorly done and essentially reflects if nothing changes from today aside from growth. They didn't account for technological advances, alternative cooling, and massive strides in renewable energy that would take place if bitcoin and other PoW coins continue to grow. All of those things will occur if they do, since competition in the hardware sector would grow as well as competition in the mining sector. 
If bitcoin gets large enough to push us 2 degrees celcius, we will see people with farms fully sustained by wind and solar, and advanced systems that would combine solar and current/tidal forces to cool and power systems in the far north. Sure, if people just sat around and nothing else changed aside from growth, it might be possible for mining to cause that, but that's not the reality we live in. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:47:25
A let down, you had a chance for greatness there.
@_date: 2018-10-31 00:28:53
I think the biggest thing here is that as it grows and becomes more secure, the trustless factor comes into play (pretty much there, but some could still argue it's not). That has never before been the case in human existence, which is why it's far superior to fiat or centrally controlled currencies. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 01:02:43
Can't happen without multiple space colonies and a bunch of other things, but if we have the ability to generate food and water for that many people, I could see it.
That said, the entire economy has to shift, along with schooling, policies, etc. for this to have any chance. We probably also need to figure out how to manipilate gravitational waves, because there isn't enough within our solar system to sustain 1 trillion people (can't be certain of that, but I'm pretty sure that's the case).
I think it's 50/50 we pull that off or go extinct. Whether we use bitcoin by then, who knows, but I wouldn't rule it out since centralized systems will continue to fail. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 01:14:45
Didn't buy, but learned about it in 2009 on 4chan -  I was dead set on mining it, but couldn't afford to buy a computer capable of earning anything decent back then.

Yup, I dun fucked up! That said, my PC had zero chance of mining anything even decent. Had a 6 year old $400 desktop that could manage 2fps on the lowest settings on anything but diablo 2. I begged my parents to help me get me a PC capable of mining, but they thought I was crazy.

If anything, precious metal is held down via paper trading currently  so if all hits the fan the paper is worthless and the actual metal will explode in value. I think gold, silver, and crypto are all good calls given the glaring issues with our current monetary policy. (And once demand for the dollar drops, we are all on trouble) 
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:09:11
I get where you are coming from, but using bitcoins as a term and requiring people to understand the full conversions over the long run wont make sense, so if you want to prevent the long term re-education, now is the time to do it (and the people involved in it are more adaptable than the average person). 
Establishing a Satoshi value/symbol for the lighting network now (maybe it's just a sBTC or something like that) is very needed, since in the long run thats what we will be measuring with. Using "bitcoins" seems wrong to me, as that would indicate multiple bitcoin, not fractions of a bitcoin. mBTC, etc. is better than bitcoins in my opinion. 
While adoption is only at 1% is exactly when you need to be makong these decisions, since as you said, a lot of people like resisting change - so make the change before they are here to resist it. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:32:59
I hope you had more than 1 btc at least. Getting scammed can be the cheapest way to avoid massive loss in the future. That was a $6500 learning experience for you - thats more costly than most, but could save you a lot in the long run. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 15:02:43
The fact you don't have to trust an entity, and as mining and mining pools become more distributed it really becomes trustless (where you aren't trusting a 3rd party with your money, or concerned about mining centralization - bitcoin doesn't have the 3rd party, but mining could be more decentralized, and some could argue that - I'm thinking of a time where that will not be questioned at all). As long as the mining stays distributed, bitcoin is trustless. 
Historically, money has always equated to trust, which is why USD has been king for a while - everyone trusts that it will be accepted, and that treasury bonds will not default, etc. Bitcoin eliminates trust completely as long as it remains fully distributed and not controlled by a single person, entity, or group/cartel. 
I think it's hard to put a value on that, as it has never existed before now. 
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:56:44
Well, you could look at it differently and still have a good outcome. New investors stop coming in, but bitcoin has created its own self sustaining economy, where goods and services are traded based on btc/sat prices. At that point, you wouldn't necessarily need investors to increase the value - it would happen naturally. You could also argue no new investors are actually needed, as all existing could fight over incoming supply, which will be halving.
I get that if there is no demand the price will reflect that, but anyone with a brain can see the value of btc, and I would argue we've come too far to go to zero - too many heavily invested in mining + ASIC research, too many bitcoin maximalists, too many people that actually need it or will need it to protect their wealth. Just because a large portion of the population doesn't get it doesn't mean it won't succeed - just look at the internet, tons wrote it off without understanding it at first, and look at them now. The difference is that btc will be here as fiat fails, nothing needed to fail for the internet to succeed, and I would argue the same for btc, but fiat failure would be like adding rocket fuel to the flame.
@_date: 2019-10-17 15:33:10
Well if you phrase it in purchasing power it works - that said, definitely more tham 10m purchasing power since everything is so fucked.
@_date: 2019-10-03 14:34:31
The answer is to hold until you believe the price is too high for current functionality (bubble peak) - I would consider selling some somewhere around 200k if that happens in the next 2 years. However, never sell all your bitcoin, because you never know when the true moon will be happening (S curve adoption). Long term, I'm in the 1m-100m per bitcoin group (probably will be worth 10m per in my lifetime if it works out like I think it will).

Honestly, owning any and hodling it for a few years should be an achievement for anyone.

Agree 100%, only an idiot would want to have the supply increase. There is a reason we have satoshis as a measurement. If someone thinks we need more, they need to change their thinking. You have 100,000,000 Satoshis per bitcoin, so it's easy enough to think of 1 satoshi being the standard unit of measure 10-20 years from now (if not sooner given it's already the standard on the lightning network).

Pro Tip: You'll always buy the bottom (or very close to) if you're always buying/dumping fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:25:19
That it will, I made the mistake of not buying at 30 cents because I was stuck focusing on the mining aspect, yet again before the second bull run but I couldn't afford the ASICs at that point. Finally could afford to mine the 3rd bull run, which was profitable, but 15x less than if I had just bought bitcoin instead. This bear market, I finally wised up and bought between the 6k and 3100 each time I got paid. Sadly, watching it for this long I still have less btc than OP. Either way, I'm confident what little I do have will offer me freedom in the future, so although I missed out on my lambo I still believe btc will give me enough wealth to do as I please (probably wouldn't buy a lambo even if it went to 100m a coin though - far better things for me to do with that money if that happens)
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:11:10
Pretty sure that's a stock image and not OPs portfolio.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:29:28
I would still call it money, I would call fiat and such a currency as opposed to money. Bitcoin was both for a while, and probably will be both again via L2 scaling.
@_date: 2019-02-20 01:10:20
Aaaaand you ruined it :(

Gotta hodl that cake for when we breach 100k!
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:47:24
There is a big difference between those - people having been believing that for centuries and have come and gone. Bitcoin has proven the week hands wrong time and time again, and fundamentally makes far superior money than anything we've had thus far (that we know of).
@_date: 2019-06-13 22:01:42
I highly doubt that, but if so, I would be buying all that I could at that point. 
Institutional money hasn't really started to flow like it will, so stating most bitcoin is traded by hedgefunds is most likely false. I would imagine most is traded via bots (or false trades via derivative echanges), and the vast majority of those bots wouldn't be run by hedgefunds. 
I have no doubt the US stock market will crash, but I highly doubt we will see $100 btc for more than a few seconds. And honestly, someone panic selling for a flash crash is dumb, and far from what a hedgefund would be doing. They are typically all about weighted holdings, which together protect the fund from volitility.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:47:31
Pretty sure we will see 6k again before the strong climb up. That said, this is bitcoin, so no one knows for sure if it will actually drop to that level again.

Bitcoin won't drop to $8 for any sustained period of time - too many people that would be buying non-stop.

Guys, I just need 10,000 BTC if any of you would be kind enough the hook a brother up. I wanted  mine in 2009, but was running a $400 7 year old PC at the time. I figure if I had a solid computer at the time, I would have accumulated at least 80,000 bitcoin, so I'm really only asking for 1/8th of what I would have had. I'm sure that's practically chump change if you are Buffet, Gates, or Bezos, so let's get this ball rolling!
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:30:39
I wanted to mine in 2009, but my laptop had crapped out, and my only computer was an 8 year old trashcan desktop that would have caught fire. I told my mom about it at the time and asked for a new computer, and she told me that's a dumb idea... back then I thought it had the chance to go to 1 million per btc, so aside from some small profit taking, I could have been one of the OG HODLers. Learned about BTC on 4chan back then.

How strong do you typically make your passwords? You could potentially try to brute force it via john the ripper* (edited from jack lol) or something if you didn't get too crazy back then.
Your best bet is probably to guess and check non stop until you figure it out though since you made the password originally. There could only be so many passwords you would have used back then - start making a list as you attempt to get in, and go from there. 
Must be nice sitting on that once you get in! If this works and you feel generous, definitely would take any amount of bitcoin you're willing to pass my way (PM me and I'll give you my address).

I doubt it, but who knows what all will happen when a true bottom is established, and when that will happen. If it happens soon, we could definitely see the price start to shoot back up. I guess 15k could be possible, but I think it's a reach since most bull runs get one solid jump and then a slower ascent, and 15k seems far too high.

If you didn't have the foresight to see what Amazon, or Netflix, or Tesla, or Microsoft, or Google, or any other game changing company that had the potential to change the world could do at the time their products were young, you would have missed those opportunities.
There are different kinds of investing. Investing based on sound financial principals, which should give you somewhat steady returns over the lifetime of their ownership, but wont get you filthy rich unless you're in the big leagues (value investing). And then you have investing based on what a lot would consider "speculation", but I think when you are step above that, it's "foresight". Is there more risk involved in that? Sure there is, but with risk comes reward. It's a lot more difficult to have foresight and the guts to follow it through on that belief than it is is to crunch some numbers and read through some financial statements. 
If you're value investing, it will take a very long time to reach financial freedom, but as long as the system doesn't change, you'll probably be in a good spot 40 years from now (as close to a guarantee as it comes probably).
With foresight, you may miss a few, but if you hit a few you'll probably be far richer in a 1/4 of the time than you would be after nearly a lifetime of value investing. 
Now you can point to Buffet, since it's hard to argue his strategy doesn't work, but his strategy also missed the biggest movers over the last 10+ years. Times are changing, and the opportunities they had in the past are no longer here. Buffet and others in his generation had tons of opportunity in front of them, and a system that if played right, would allow you to pretty much always be winning, or at least not be losing (which is coming to an end). Take gold for example - if you bought gold at the beginning of 1971 as well as the S&amp;P 500, gold would have outperformed the S&amp;P. That alone should show how fragile our system is. To put it differently, the S&amp;P 500 would have had negative returns over that time compared to a dollar backed by 1/40th an ounce of gold (if all else stayed the same). The S&amp;P 500 is what most prominent investors will advise as well, and for good reason since it has typically outperformed the market and mutual funds. 
I interpret all of this to essentially mean that the market has been going negative. The only reason it doesn't look that way is due to the devaluation of the dollar, as it's being devalued faster than the market "grows". Someone with foresight would see the problems for what it is, and I'm sure they would also see crypto as a potential solution. When losses have a limit, but the gains don't, it seems like a massively good investment, and not a gamble. It's not like blackjack where the most you can win on a hand is 1.5x what you bet, with the potential of a 100% loss.
People buying crypto for the right reasons have the vision to see the current system for what it is, and the foresight to see how crypto can offer a better system moving forward.

There have already been studies that have proven the secret was done successfully and that there wasn't toxic waste to be recovered. Then, it was redone in a more public manner for sapling, since that is one fallback of ZK setups (the need for this "trusted" setup).
I personally think the founders reward isn't a bad thing. It's supporting the future development of zcash in a way where they can afford to hire people. Not all people who could help grow blockchain can afford to sit at home and do it for free like early bitcoin dev's. I think this will work out in ZEC's favor in the long run.
ZEC has the opportunity to be more distributed than BTC since you had more mining competition early on (as far as coin distribution goes). Mining wise same thing - has the opportunity to be more distributed. I also think what it offers is what bitcoin was trying to offer early on. So I personally see ZEC becoming what bitcoin should have been.  
They also have a way to audit as zk transactions move between versions, which can verify the coin count.

If I were you, and didn't have debt, I would do the following:
1) sell all forks minus maybe 2-3 in each as a hedge, which could pay for your vacation.
2) Trade 5-10 BTC for ETH, ZEC, etc. As a hedge to BTC
3) determine what, if any, you want to pull out. I think stocks, bonds, and real estate are all too high to be good calls, but there could be some good options out there for cashflow.
4) HODL the rest on your ledger and sell 25-50% at 100k + per BTC

Because those investing and wanting that peace of mind don't see it as money yet. I think that's the easiest answer to this. 
Also, coinbase is giving off the appearance of a traditional finance system by doing this, which will probably play out in their favor with more traditional financial institutions and the vast uneducated population that will enter the space.

For a larger purchase you'll probably need to verify your identity. Credit card on coinbase will get you crypto fast and is very reputable, but the fees using a credit card are high, and certain banks might not let you do it.

For anyone reading this - I feel most of us know things like this are a scam, but I still think it's worth discussing. That said, I believe it's a safe rule to never give in to anything like this no matter the threat. Odds are extremely high it won't happen.
If they threaten a warrant, wait for them to show up with it.
If they threaten a lawsuit, wait to be served.
If they threaten you as a government organization, wait for them to show up.
If they threaten anything, wait for someone to show up or for proof - then talk to a lawyer if they actually have something on you. 
Almost all scams/phishing like this hit you with some info that could be potentially be true, which is why people give in. They almost never have anything, and no one will ask you for payment in bitcoin for something government related.
These scammers don't deserve anything (except a nice dose of karma), so please don't feed them. As long as people continue to give them money, they will keep doing this. The only way to stop it is to never give in, and to spread awareness (especially to old people, since they are oblivious to this stuff).
Make sure you backup your documents and info. Make sure you keep your keys offline.
Make sure you don't have anything crazy to lose via some attack like this. 
Stay safe.

As it stands, we are still in the early adoption phase. You are correct that a lot of people today don't have access to mine or buy bitcoin, but I believe that will change with the meshnet. That all said, I don't think it will make the most sense to mine for those entering the game at that point, as mining will be more business or hedge related (securing the chain), since the profit and btc income will only be net positive with ASIC advancement. 
Although some will HODL, by the time it's being fully adopted, price stability will come into play, and a lot of those hodling will have taken profits along the way. Price stability will be a good thing for those in developing areas as it will help secure their wealth (which is difficult or impossible today, and although I'm bullish, btc is not the greatest store of wealth today given the current market, although I believe it will become that) .
Opportunity for btc growth will still be there as well once it's more available to those developing countries, but I'm guessing most of those people will be left out of the next bull run. (Well, the average, I'm sure some will get in) Although by the time the masses do get in, adoption should be high enough that they can truly use btc seamlessly to live without any hoops to jump through.

A lot of trading is done with bitcoin pairs. So as bitcoin rises, the coin to bitcoin ratio seems to stay the same. However, when alt coins are pumping, the demand for bitcoin is falling, while the demand for alts is rising, essentially throwing off that balance in favor of the alts. Or at least that is what I've noticed during the alt coin cycles.
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:26:09
Regardless of the fees, if you can pay cash to get bitcoin people will use it. (Whether or not it's for the right reasons is another question entirely) 
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:01:43
You're missing the point. Bitcoin will be able to do those things, yes, but the idea is that the scarcity, transparency, inflation supply. Etc, will create a new system of ownership where people own their money and have a clear understanding of supply to come. It will be valuable due to its security, usability, scarcity, transprarency, and adoption. It will offer a financial system to those in developing areas as the mesh net comes online. I believe these prices will allow more to enter the market, which will further drive up the price during the next bull run. Advancement and innovation will happen, especially as top universities focus on blockchain. Bitcoin allows you to escape the current system, which is poorly run to say the least, even though you can easily transfer money to and from, and pay as you mentioned.

I would say I lean more conservative when it comes to government budgets, but with the dollar clearly on its way out, I would be doing all I could to use what power it still has for the good of everyday Americans. At this rate, our politicians will continue to use it as a weapon, and will ultimately ensure we all go down with the ship when the rest of the world says enough is enough. 
I think the best way to do all of the above is probably universal basic income, as it should increase the money velocity. It would be too late for us to take that step once other countries have detached from the swift system. However, while most are still settling trade in dollars, we could lessen the impact of UBI. Once countries start detaching from the swift system, it won't be long before we are in major trouble. 
I also think that infrastructure should be addressed while we can still import the goods we neef at reasonable prices.

Or btc value will skyrocket and fees will stay the same. Lot's can change the variables, but long term, fees alone should cover the cost of mining.
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:48:56
Good point, whether they believe in it or not is almost moot point. It shows they lack awareness completely, which means our best bet to educate the college kids is by opening a bitcoin bookstore, where the buy/sell price ratio is reasonable and food is cheap (Assuming all universities are in the book business, you know, the one where you pay $300 for a book that they will then give you $5 for 3 months later, only to resell 10x higher the next day).
All jokes aside, seems like it's surprisingly still awareness that's an issue. 
Edit: My first thought was that bitcoin needs more awareness, but after reflecting, I think people need to be more aware of the current financial system first so they begin to question it. Once they understand how broken our current system is, they will be looking for alternatives, and bitcoin is a top alternative.
Also, the 20% seems to follow the 80/20 rule well, which could be seen as good news. If we assume those in the 20% are the future value producers in society (a leap, but not an impossible one, as they are clearly far more aware than their counterparts), we can infer a person in the remaining 80% will only add 1/16th the (tangible) value to society. This can be seen as a positive, as we can basically disregard what those in the 80% think when it comes to bitcoin and money, as they are wrong. They might add value in other non-tangible ways, but they won't be the leaders of the future economy.

Honestly, the odds are high half of the funds become available when you deposit, and once you give him his half, he will cancel the check or funds and you'll be out 10k. 
Pretty sure it's a scam - could always ask to hold the funds for 30 days (or whatever your bank mentions is a safe clear point), and see what they say. If they let you clear the check fully where it can't be undone (confirmed by your bank), then you should be pretty safe taking the money (unless you are worried it's tied to laundering or something along those lines)

Would be more fitting to see a transfer of something like 400k bitcoin around then, essentially like 28 trillion today.

You can also just pay the high fees, I recall paying over $100 during peak bull 2017 so I could get some fiat. If you follow the trend, things are greatly improving, so it wont be a problem forever.

I'm suggesting long term, lighting will solve the microtransaction issue, and short term, don't do microtransactions while fees are high, or use a solid altcoin for the microtransactions. I suggest ltc and zec myself, but there are plenty (I think another commentor mentioned a list)

Didn't finish reading your pist completely, but you could look at it the other way, and say the reason bitcoins value is going up in terms of fiat is because fiat is going down in value compared to bitcoin. Paired with decreasing supply/mining rewards, it only makes sense for it to be worth more fiat in the future.
Also, we believe fiat is going to be worthless, but that doesn't mean we are idiots that believe others have removed themselves from the illusion. We know fiat has value today, the system is just designed to fail, and eventually will. That's why you'll want some plan Btc.
Edit: Saw your question at the end. Bitcoin is better because it's decentralized and free. Gov't cryto will be the same system we have today, they would just have additional power over the system that they don't have today. They will still "print money" and do as they please, which isn't in the interest of the people. Also, the federal reserve isn't a government backed entity, and they definitely aren't looking out for you, me, or anyone but themseleves. I would be far more on board with a US Treasury Crypto, one truly controlled by our government, but even then, bitcoin would still be superior.

Think of it as built in interest. Just because you receive interest on your money today doesnt mean you won't spend it (I know rates are lowncurrently, but it's the idea). It eliminates banks as a middle man, and in turn would reward the holders with more value instead of the banks. At full blown adoption, it would essentially be just currency like you use today, that also happens to be a store of value since a 3rd party can't magically print more when they feel like it. Would it appreciate a bit? Sure, but nothing insane if it had already been adopted, at least as long as population growth didn't boom (which with the way things are today, would be unsustainable and cause other issues far more serious problems).
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:05:15

If you are looking to re-enter at 20k, then go ahead and wait another 1-2 years. If you want to enter at the bottom, it's not 1-2 years out.

I would put the odds of you missing the bottom at 98%, but buying in the bull market could be smart I'd you're okay with missing out on the potential gains for the safety.

Bitcoin is 100% a threat to the world banking system, and you are delusional if you are unable to see that. Could it replace it today? No, but 5 or 10 years out it most definitely could.

It's actually both. With the fractional reserve system, you do need to have a minimum balance of cash, but it basically can allow a bank to lend 10x what someone else puts in. That 10x follows your pattern, as some of those become deposits, which can then be loaned against, etc. Seems like a continuously broken loop, because I'm pretty sure that's exactly what it was designed to be.

Eventually you'll probably be able to piggy back off of litecoin transactions, and I'm sure we will have bitcoin banks someday. In that world, the community would absolutely need to make sure they don't allow fractional reserves, and since bitcoin is transparent, we could do that. The "bitcoin banks" would do periodic settlements to reduce overall cost and to avoid bogging down the blockchain. I'm sure there will be a point where only large sums of money are transferred on the bitcoin blockchain, while lightning would be used day to day for the vast majority of people. Definitely not a short term solution, but I think that's where we are headed. 
For now, just limit the number of transactions you are making, or use litecoin for your smaller moves.

Honestly, I'm pretty sure just showing this evidence can get you full custody. Obviously she doesn't care about your child - I wouldn't even sell my dog, let alone a child.

So they are all ignorant? I guess it's hard to put a large group of people into a bucket, but I would assume 95% of those in that group would fight to defend the dollar without any real knowledge of how the system truly works. The remaining 5% would be more open minded, and realize their mistake and self correct. However, the remaining 95% would rather live in an illusion without using any critical thinking what-so-ever, which is why I guess I consider most of them idiots instead of ignorant.

As it stands, they are nearly accurate. It's close to the lowest price in 2018 lol.

That sure made you angry for some reason. I would imagine someone with English as a second language would appreciate knowing they've made a mistake or typo so they can improve moving forward - especially since the quote was pretty solid.

Haven't thought about it this way before, but those bottom two hit close to home.

Human nature is violence and pushing boundaries - we've learned to share and cooperate for the greater success of all, which is taught. Although at our core, we do work best in community type situations. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:43:02
Yeah, exactly - once we are over 7 figures, it will be adopted enough to use, so no need to cash out.

Although your 100 most likely will never turn to millions, I'm sure someday it will far eclipse your portfolio. Good call buying!

Warren Buffet also has huge chunks of his wealth in the banking system, so Bitcoin is a direct threat to his pocket and company.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:19:53
more like 1.5 years as I have multiple 6 month periods, but still a bit far fetched for sure!
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:42:08
I would say cooperation and sharing is what is taught. Why else would little children bite, kick, scream, and endlessly push limits until they learn they need to cooperate and share to be liked and treated well?

You can sue for anything, it's just whether you'll win or not.
