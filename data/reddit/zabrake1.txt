Ok. So on the price chart, they're currently going for £1915.00 roughly and the spread is £15.00, So if I want to trade 0.01 of bitcoin into £ now I would deduct the spread from the current price, (£1900) and select'Buy or Sell???' Then 'Limited Trade' - Bitcoin value 0.01 and a limit price of £1900ish? In the 'GBP' section underneath it's now showing £19.00. Bitcoin seems low right now so I should really be buying?

I've opened a GDAX account. Can I use that to trade daily and turn a profit, or do I need to use another feature? Is just using coinbase and GDAX a good set-up for what I'm trying to do?

I wanted to fraud all the euro in my account €10.89 into bitcoin. How do i do it using a LIMITED TRADE using the stats on the Imgur picture? I cannot figure this out. I've tried EVERYTHING, buying and selling at various amounts and it keeps returning with "invalid"!

Ok, thanks again! So right now Bitcoin is at £1930ish. Earlier today it was at  £2130! I don't currently have any cash in my GDAX account so I can't buy low right now. Can I set a LIMITED TRADE up now, to sell 0.01 of my bitcoin at 2100.00 in the limited field and it will make that trade overnight whenever BTC goes up again? Am I right in thinking that ? How long can I leave it on there for, and would the trade I explained incur any fee? When does the trade incur a fee?

I really want to learn how to buy low and sell high daily - but I'm stumped right now. I know I'm probably just missing a fundamental piece of info!

So in the Limit Field I've put the price of a whole bitcoin at its current price and it still doesn't work ?

Bitcoin is low right now, it was at £2130 earlier and it's now at £1930. I should sell bitcoin when it's high and buy at its lowest? So you need GBP and BTC both in your GDAX account at any time to do both ?

Ah ok. It was more of a test to be honest, I was just confused why it was saying 'INVALID!' So I want to take the current market value, and then remove the spread amount from it? And when you say market value do you mean the market value of 1 whole coin?  Is that what I input, not the value of 0.001?

What is the alternative to using coinbase / GDAX for trading? I know there's a few, but which is the best and what would you recommend seeing as you seem to dislike Coinbase?

Thank you so much! You put that in such an easy way to read &amp; understand. Much appreciated!

Thank you! Just figured this out too. I've got my first trade going right now yipee!!!
