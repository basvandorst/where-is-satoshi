It's meant to address the potential continuation of the larger bull market we have been in since late 2015. I believe that with increased awareness and adoption, the market actually has been growing fairly consistently on a logarithmic scale.

People can still make small instant purchases on exchanges without needing to send network transactions if they do not immediately send to an external wallet.

I don't think many current cryptocurrencies are better positioned to fill the currency and store of value case as Bitcoin, at least now. The immutability and decentralized nature are revolutionary and insanely powerful features in my eyes, which make this kind of 'value' unique to anything that has ever existed. I think a large part of Bitcoin's strength is also it's massive amount of attention and resources being invested in improvement, scaling, and overall betterment of bitcoin by many companies and individuals. We have a network of people nurturing it.

Yes, but here we're dealing with the human psychological patterns of growth and adoption. It's not a random variable we're looking at, it's people. The price chart in my opinion is actually an abstract modeling of the human sentiment towards bitcoin, and this is not something we are so out of touch with to see as mere random variability.

I'm not using this, and no one should use this as investment guidance or advice, I'm just pointing out that this 2 year trend has emerged as bitcoin has gotten it's feet under itself and become more mainstream. Over and over, every time someone yelled 'it's crashing!'. It's what makes all the fear mongering every time a 30% correction happens look so silly.  I think it could very well continue for some time, however if we are in fact at the beginning stages of a S-curve of adoption.

This is purely entertainment to me, having fun looking for patterns and then seeing how well they do or don't play out. Not being used to inform trading. This pattern, however has been consistent for each occurrence going back over 2 years

It does touch and bounce off the 100 day MA, but I've just noticed that a consistent stretch under 55 day MA is a more regular precedent to a bull run.

It's repeated this behavior pattern seven straight times since September 2015

I should correct: It's the 55 day moving average, not 50 day MA
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:32:49
This isn't investing advice, just a fun way to ponder a chart. Still believe in holding. I'm just pointing this out as an interesting pattern if we assume the bullish trend may continue, though I'm not saying it will or that we should invest more at this time.

Paper wallet to and from web wallet will cost you a transaction fee to sweep your paper wallet into the web wallet address. GDAX does pay the network fee for transactions currently. I didn't note it, but the reason to use GDAX for outgoing transactions is because Coinbase does not allow you set a custom fee, thus it charges way too high of an estimated fee even though much cheaper fee transactions will still go through just fine.

If you transfer BTC over to GDAX which is is instant and free if you have a Coinbase wallet, you can then send out/withdraw BTC for no transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:46:33
If you sell your BTC for USD on GDAX, the maxium fee ranges from nothing to 0.25%, a much more modest fee than the typical 1.49% for Coinbase buys and sells from/to a bank account.

This is a great intro vid about what 'paper wallets' and 'cold storage' are and how you can actually generate your own offline wallets to practice storing and sending bitcoin with. Start small and keep learning.   
Also, based on my understanding, the easiest way to have highly secure storage is with an cold hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger device, which are easy to use and highly secure if done properly.

No fee for outgoing BTC network transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:57:04
To clarify: YES, you can transfer BTC to an outside wallet address from your coinbase wallet, but the fee is not customizable, thus the fee estimation is still way too high despite the mempool clearing 5-20 sat/byte transactions, and thus costs several dollars instead of what could be a reasonably lower fee, thus if GDAX is free for outgoing txns, just send it that way. Transfer to GDAX from Coinbase wallet and send.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:54:05
Exactly. Just transfer to GDAX wallet and send to private wallet with no fee.
