“One of the fun things about bitcoin is that it completely changes your attitude about all of the terrible things happening in the rest of the world because before I got into bitcoin I was like, ‘Oh, no — unfunded liabilities.’ And now I’m like, ‘Yes. Destroy everything as quickly as possible.’ All of that is great for bitcoin.”
This has been my experience with learning more and more about Bitcoin as well. I am much more optimistic about the future than I was before knowing that it existed.

•	Backed by the exponentially growing computational power of the hashing network, incentivized miners that continuously verify all transactions, the security of cryptography, the best-of-breed innovation that comes with open sourced software, and the logic and elegance of math to control its supply.  It is not backed by promises by politicians and governments to pay their debts and make decisions in the best interest of the societies they serve.
•	Instant payments and instant public verification on the blockchain by anybody and from anywhere.  No other system of payment is as fast or transparent to every participant, no matter who they are or what their financial or societal status is. 
•	Transact and trade with anyone in the world (including the unbanked, or even those without a computer).  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system that eliminates the need for an expensive trusted third party, and you can transfer any amount of value on a printed paper wallet.
•	Cheap transaction costs means cheaper goods and services, and a level playing field for small businesses competing with large corporations.  Also, when merchants don’t have to worry about chargebacks, they can afford to lower their prices and pass along the savings to you. 
•	Own your own money and move it instantly whenever you want.  No need to depend on banks, forex systems, middlemen, card issuers, and wait days to move money between antiquated systems. 
•	Innovative and disruptive technology that will open the doors for new opportunities, new business models, and create better standards of living for billions of people.  The Bitcoin protocol (and its future sidechains) will do to banks, credit card companies, stock markets, title companies, wallets, vending machines, online news, digital media, crowd-funding, charities, governments, politics, taxes, and wearable tech what the Internet did for so many other industries it transformed and created.
•	Network that is democratically controlled, distributed, and unstoppable.  It’s not a corporation, it’s not bound by the laws of a single country, nor controlled by a single person (i.e. Satoshi!).

Thanks for the info!  I looked into both their ToS and Cryptothrift charges a 2.5% fee and Bitpremier charges a 5% fee on the sale of the item.  Craigslist and OpenBazaar - 0% fees.  I'm going to try to transact for 0% fees first as to not raise the price any higher, but may consider these in the future.

I think you should do it.  Promotion is key right now, and I feel like we are at a grassroots campaign stage in order to take this to the mass market.  We need viral marketing... clever things... that are "techy" yet snide.  For instance, funny t-shirts that poke fun at current Bitcoin headlines or "misunderstandings" would be a clever way to gain attention, poke fun at the situation yet making the audience think... differently.   I don't think that slapping the Bitcoin logo on various things like mugs, stickers, and t-shirts is going to get anyone's attention.  Focus on things that are clever, unique, and will spread in a viral fashion, because it has a unique appeal.  Check out these sites and get some inspiration from here:
    and start an underground revolution.  Offer up rewards for graphic art submissions from the Bitcoin community.  Shipping?  Let that cost be calculated automatically by the shipping provider.  Your prices for your products should have all of your margin there.  Offer bulk discounts in various quantities - help seed this revolution for promoters as well.  Hope that helps.

If possible, make the "buyer" the same person throughout each scenario.  
I like this idea, let me attempt to build off of it to showcase more benefits:
Scene 1: change to buying something small and simple - coffee at Starbucks or Panera.  Bankers not only charge a 2-3% handling fee, but with small purchases, they often have [minimum thresholds](  So if you buy a $5 coffee, minimum finance charges are between $0.35 and $0.50, making it much worse. (plus, this makes Scene 4 that much more meaningful).  Bonus: make it look like they're using "Apple Pay" (still just a credit card with fees and risk)
Scene 2: buying something expensive online, internationally to show more bankers in-between.  Show different bankers in each country taking their cut.  Making it at least double-expensive to transact across borders.    
Scene 3: remittance.  Show the same person sending money to their family in another country.  Also, somehow illustrate this as taking a long period of time (days).  Maybe the family goes to check if their money is available and it's not, and they have to come back the next day. 
Scene 4: Show that person watching the news and hearing about a big security breach that affects anyone who ever shopped at the coffee shop (act 1) in that last 5 years.  Show that person logging into their credit card account and seeing unauthorized charges to their account.   
Then, Change the tag line to "Bitcoin.  Cut out the middle men.  Take full control of your money."
Final 5s or so... a quick flash of several images and words highlighting the benefits:
 - Easy. (person to person, no paperwork, online and offline)
 - Secure. (strong cryptography, no privacy info necessary for transactions)
 - Open. (the best and most innovative ideas in the world are built on open-source platforms).
 - Fair. (minimal fees, no middle men, finite supply)
 - Global. (not backed by the honesty of any single government or banking authority)
 - Protocol.  (currency is only the first application of a new invention... the blockchain)

In order to gain mainstream adoption, Bitcoin needs to become more widespread in merchant adoption.  If I can pay my bills, buy gas, get groceries, or go out to eat with Bitcoin anywhere in America, I would use it more to spend, and so would everyone else.  We'd reach a "tipping point" as it becomes a mainstay.  The big corporations of the world are waiting to see what will happen to Bitcoin in the face of regulation that is still being debated and defined.  If during this timeframe the price plummets, those "Tier 1" merchants sitting on the sideline will be less inclined to accept Bitcoin as a payment, as it would appear too volatile, and risky.  Make sense?  I absolutely agree that using Bitcoin in everyday life (in addition to investing in it) will help gain traction, but until I see a profit (based on when I bought in), I would be at a loss to spend my Bitcoins.  I'm sure many "investors" feel the same.  Of course I could buy more Bitcoin, buy Gyft card, and spend that way, but that is still more steps and more risk if the price is dropping every day.  Investors in this space are just as important as any other contributor, and to give them shit is to degrade a vital part of the community.  We're all adding value to the network.  Some just have different time horizons for when they will spend compared to others. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 00:17:27
That issue would only exist in the short term.  As the value of Bitcoin increases against the dollar, fewer bits will be necessary for all transactions.  Switching to bits will lay the groundwork for mass adoption and make the switch easier for consumers to comprehend.  Thinking in terms of 2 decimal points is much more familiar.  Plus, "bits" will make micro-transactions and tipping easier to discuss to n00bs.

People are here to learn about the progress of Bitcoin, including significant factors (and opportunities for entrepreneurs) to creat a tipping point to bring it to the mainstream.  When Cyprus bail-ins were happening the news caught wind of the potential for Bitcoin in this situation and it became a short-lived self-fulfilling prophecy when people were lined up at a BTM that was soon installed by an entrepreneur in the Bitcoin space.

I live in Denver and am often wondering where all the bitcoin accepting businesses are. Don't give up, the bitcoin community is out there and growing... Slowly.  With the continued decline in price, I'm still trying to average down, and would be foolish to spend at a 60% loss right now. I'm sure many others are in the same boat if they're hodling.  Once the price recovers, expect a lot more media attention and consumer attention on bitcoin and businesses like yours. You will be positioned to profit off bitcoin acceptance when the time comes (i.e. Wall Street money phase begins). Keep doing what you're doing!

Yeah, I think that's a bit low.  What would be great (especially right now with these prices) is if the commission was paid in bitcoin.

I think if this happened the price would jump 10% immediately, then it would be different to tell how much this is driving the price.  I do think there is some built-up demand due to GBTC's premium price to have this asset class in your IRA. Once the price starts to really climb, it will be difficult to point to any one factor (halving - even months after it happens, Brexit, China, Wall Street, U.S. election results, etc.).  They will all be happening and create a feedback loop.

There should be an automatic rating system based on the number of transactions processed and/or maturity of their Bitcoin payment features. For instance:
 1 star: business advertises they accept Bitcoin
 2 stars: 1 transaction posted in the last month
 3 stars: 2 transactions posted in last month
 4 stars: Average of at least 1 transaction posted per month for last 6 months. 
 5 stars: Average of at least 1 transactions posted per month for last 6 month, and a 3-5% merchant discount offered
May also want a way for people to rank their experiences, so that if they get a waitress who doesn't know how to process a Bitcoin payment or says they don't offer that, their score can be dropped.  Other services also come to mind... Can the merchant offer call-ahead seating / preferred seating / reservations / valet service for $1-5 in Bitcoin?  Do the waitresses have their own Bitcoin wallets for tips, so you can tip them directly?  Can a frequent diner program (10th meal is free or something) be validated on the blockchain?  All these may be incentives the merchant can use to demonstrate or contribute to their overall Bitcoin acceptance score that shows on your site.

@_date: 2015-09-09 15:24:53
I agree and would like to state it another way...
Bitcoin is a worldwide "sleeper technology."  There are smart people from all walks of life on this planet that are beginning to understand that Bitcoin is an immutable peer-to-peer network that can change the world in more ways than we can think of today. One day, the masses will wake up and be using Bitcoin without even knowing it.  They'll just be telling their friends and family about some awesome feature that some company's app or appliance can do now, and it just happens "magically" or "automatically" or "instantly".  The old world ways of conducting business, voting, commuting, researching, and even getting the latest news will all come crumbling down.  By this time, it will be too late for the mature, entrenched organizations to try to discover, mimic, or even implement "Blockchain tech" (without Bitcoin of course) and try to fold their old business model around such an unstoppable force that makes their entire existence obsolete.  The next generation is already hard at work building dozens of killer apps for Bitcoin and there is no turning back from this groundbreaking, proven, open-source network protocol that solves the "double spend" problem and is secured by more computing power than any organization or government has or could afford.  The cat is out of the bag and the only thing between here and the moon is time itself.  No one knows how long exactly, but relax and be patient.  The end game is probably further than any one person can imagine today. 
TLDR, Bitcoin is a sleeper.  It's beyond critical mass now and the next generation gets it.  It's not "if" Bitcoin will succeed, it's only "when."

Very nice intro to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-04 23:46:04
Yes. Many of us are waiting for BTC price to equate to our "average cost" or better before spending. Otherwise you're being a consumer at a very expensive premium.

Outlawing Bitcoin is like prohibition to alcohol. Eventually, it's pointlessness will become apparent and the decision will be reversed, but only after wasting billions trying to stop something that is by its very nature unstoppable.  It will not last and the first countries that take the opposite approach and adopt Bitcoin as a currency will benefit economically... Significantly more than any economic policy in history. Those populations will become rich with Bitcoin's deflation, efficiencies, innovations, and redistribution of wealth while Europe's economy will collapse even harder as the Euro tanks and bail-ins ensue. There will be less incentive and money for European governments to police a system that is already spreading quickly worldwide. Prohibition of Bitcoin doesn't help stop terrorism at all. You do not want to force a decentralized system this powerful further underground and into the dark net by incentivizing innovation around hiding your Bitcoin activities. What a dumb idea if you want to stop terrorism. It's not going to hurt the terrorists, it's going to hurt the European citizens themselves by missing out on the biggest innovation since the Internet.

B2B and B2C services where Bitcoin is not converted to fiat. So if I sell boondoggles, and pay my suppliers and my employees in Bitcoin, and those parties use their Bitcoin to pay for other services, then we create a positive feedback loop where the "Bitcoin economy" starts to take off, not just Bitcoin the commodity or store of value. That is how we emerge into the mainstream markets, by creating our own damn economy.

What a closed-minded douche. He clearly doesn't understand disruption and Bitcoin is over his head. Let them scoff. Bitcoin will replace fiat (probably after he's dead) and yesterday's billionaires will have missed the boat entirely as a new class of technology-literate wealthy world-citizens emerges.

The Winkelvii basically appeal to a different audience than has been reached, one that wouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 10-foot pole. It's weird for this community to wrap their heads around it, but there are actually people who feel comforted by regulation, compliance, and basically legal recourse if things go south.  That need for comfort to dip their toes into Bitcoin grows when we're talking about deep-pocketed institutional investors.  We need to continue to cheer on the Winkelvii for expanding our user base to a whole new class of investors.  This is the boost that we've needed for over a year.  I think this is great news and can't wait to see the impact of the launch - that is over the first year.

Because employer-sponsored 401K plans with match offer limited choice for employees.  Mostly, you're stuck with whichever provider (Fidelity for me) and have to choice from one of their funds or take your own risk on a regulated exchange such as Nasdaq or OTCQX.  You can't take your employer-sponsored retirement plan and say direct it at a Circle account.

YouTube keeps saying "technical difficulties."  Is this working for anyone?
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:42:51
I hope so.  I've been watching Fidelity and so far, and there has been no update on their site since [this went up]( shortly after Barry's tweet a few weeks ago.

Shittycoin... ahem... Citicoin, will never win.  This is hilarious to watch this conglomerate waste their millions on trying to mimic a decentralized peer-to-peer system.  They missed what "protocol" means in Networks 101.  The innovation for the next killer app (which is already being built x1000 around the world) will happen at the edge of a permissionless blockchain.  How else could it happen in a permissioned world?  Their time to market for every innovation will be too slow by the fact that they are a closed, centralized, bureaucracy. LOL! :D

I think the rebound will hit once GBTC is live.

MasterCard is being a hypocrite. But I always knew they would eat their words!  Dumb fucks.

Ask everyone you pay if they accept Bitcoin. Today, I wrote a handwritten note to one of my bills I have to mail a check to asking if they would please consider accepting Bitcoin. I tell them it's free and settlements are instant (basically, when comparing to fiat and mailing checks). I remind them that it is 2015 and only accepting mailed checks is ridiculous in this day and age. I put a link to Bitpay.com and that's it. Adopt this strategy for each bill or merchant you pay. Eventually the message will be repeated enough so that when they hear about Bitcoin in the news again, they'll remember that they have customers demanding it and action will follow. This is going to be a slow process, but we all need to chip away at this block until it gives way. Getting more services to accept Bitcoin is helping to build a closed loop economy for it (or lay down the tracks for when the next wave of adoption starts).

This is an interesting development for Bitcoin's next breakout moment. Sidechains for smart contracts could easily produce the killer app Bitcoin needs, AND show banks how creating a sidechain is the best way to implement "Blockchain technology."

Andreas Antonopoulos. Nuff said.

How about a real simple "smart contracts" mobile app.  I can imagine choosing from a few prebuilt templates and defining the parameters (time-based, or event-based: choose a URL and string to match), escrow amount, and the parties contact info. The app then sends an email verification to all parties, when the parties click to agree to the smart contract terms (and simultaneously verify their identity), the contract is written to the Blockchain for a small fee.  You could have a portion of the fee go directly to your BTC address (for developing and supporting the app) and the other minimal miners fee to record the contract in the Blockchain.  You could use counterparty's API's or similar... just keep it within the Bitcoin ecosystem.  I think something like this would be huge!  People could use this for sports betting, or really betting on anything, like the weather even.  I'm sure there's millions of use cases, but the key is to start with something simple, like betting, and go from there.

I like this ad!

I wish I could go. This is an impressive lineup and I'm sure many hundreds of innovators and entrepreneurs will find Bitcoin as fertile ground for starting something new and exciting that could literally change the world, well within  their lifetime.

I thought this was referring to an AMA with Satoshi.

Why reinvent the wheel and limit yourselves with a local currency?  Bitcoin is perfect money that could boost the local economy by being an early adopter to this technology. Once it goes mainstream in other areas, the price will go up, causing your locale to benefit tremendously if they are holding and transacting purely in Bitcoin (not exchanging to fiat as soon as a sale is made).

Use Coinbase's multisig vault.  It's easy and leaves you in control of your bitcoins even without them. I just set it up and it's awesome.
