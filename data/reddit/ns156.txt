Even a  bachelor degree isn't much. I have an econ BS from a top 15 business school. I'd say it gives me a good general knowledge of economics, but I'd be lying if I claimed to know anything beyond that.
Unless you go to grad school and beyond for economics, you don't really have anything more than a tenuous grasp on it. Like, I had one class each for micro and macro theory, and one class of econometrics. This is pretty common for econ curriculums, too. There's no way one semester of each of those is enough schooling to claim much expertise on the subject anymore than someone with a chemistry bachelor's is a "chemist".
So, while it's good that so many people in that sub actually do have college level education on the subject, they still probably act like they know far more than they actually do. Unless someone is dedicated enough to the subject to pursue it into graduate and PhD level academia, they probably don't know much at all.

It will be this. It will be attacked as enabling money laundering, supporting drugs, terrorism, or whatever.

Yep this is exactly how athletes go broke. They get suckered into buying/opening bars and restaurants, which inevitably fail within a few years because that's the nature of the industry.

Also, the Wall Street lobby isn't going to let Congress get in their way if they view Bitcoin as a viable way to make a ton of money.
