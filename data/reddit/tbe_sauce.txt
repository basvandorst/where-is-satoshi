they just shot themselves on the foot with a name like Dark Market
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:42:24
why are we not using ฿ ? who has decided for all of us to change to  Ƀ ?
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:50:30
if here's in europe,  is great
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:11:19
worst idea ever, keep it Bitcoin!

wouldn't a huge increase in BTC price put even more pressure for Japan to solve the Mtgox fail?
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:25:03
they *premined* it at the Tribeca Film Festival
@_date: 2014-05-03 13:56:57
I will support them, but hey, can we agree on re-naming the "Dark Market" thing? seems to me that "Free Market" is far better
@_date: 2014-04-24 21:24:58
^This! EMOTIONS are key in humans. Think about this:
- What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear "Dark Market"? 
- What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear "Free Market"? 
Probably the second one is far better, right? The words we use are critical. Bitcoin has had too much bad press already. 
PS: This also applies to the "movement" discussing wether to change the name Bitcoin for "Bits". Worst idea ever! Bitcoin is a great name, which is also kind of self explanatory.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:42:07
I would use if they accepted bitcoins
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:58:21
some may call it irrational behavior, but it is basically Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP). Small experiment: 
- What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear Dark Market?
- What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear Free Market?
I think we can agree that the second is far better.

this totally made my day haha
@_date: 2014-05-25 10:21:20

@_date: 2014-02-19 17:58:09
in the article from cryptocoinnews they say it will be the national ID card "DNI" which is electronic, and the bitcoin ATM will read it. But in the article it says it will probably be a €--&gt;BTC only ATM. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:22:45

we are seeing right now your private keys out of the HD from such a high resolution picture
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:42:58
it was even MENTIONED by Gavin Andresen in the MIT Bitcoin Expo 2014 that "Dark Wallet" was a poor name to chose! 
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:41:25
I ran out of Dogecoins, now it should work!

Awesome James! Your videos are great and I always send it to my family and friends.

Oh man I pay 20€/year! still worth it haha

I think you did very well on saving a copy in a safe. However, here are a few improvements I suggest you make soon rather than later:
- Have them encrypted. Even with a short password for your family to have just in case, no one from the bank will be able to retrieve them IF they open your safe box.
- store a few copies seperatedly, descentralized, so if the bank burns down to the ground you still have a few copies safe elseware. Even under your matress, if they are encrypted.
- in every "stash" use multiple formats for redundacy like: printed to paper + in a CD + high quality USB stick + and all in an airtight zip bag with some paper towels to absorb humidity
BONUS: add some instructions so your family can safely retrieve the coins. Just in case.
PS: I love that Dogecoin paper wallet man! (or women!)

@_date: 2015-01-26 17:20:36

You can also pledge with USD, EUR, etc
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:25:44
did you really do this and the guy dis not know what it was??
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:11:23
Exactly the same I said. Closed the window immediately without reading anything.
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:26:26
I saved a copy just in case. Any place where I can upload it without it being removed?
EDIT: Here's the Mega.nz link to download the original youtube video (19.40MB). Enjoy!

I would really be interested in one of those stacks as well. Will pay for it in BTC, of course.
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:40:19
Really good move from BBVA positioning themselves ahead of most banks!
I was really surprised BBVA made such a video showing how to use BTC. Was equally surprised when I saw they recommended blockchain.com and dropbox...

@_date: 2015-08-13 19:45:49
I added a MEGA link with the video, you can download it there ; )
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:40:54
I just donated to wikipedia after your post. I also did not know they accepted Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:57:46
that my mom can buy BTC with her credit card here. That would be great.
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:58:44
may I ask how do you setup an autobuy method? would love this as well
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:13:50
cool thanks! a pity they have such high fees
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:11:52
I bought a soda today with BTC, you are welcome.
