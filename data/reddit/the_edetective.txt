Indeed, but sadly I didn't know that then.

Honestly, I knew it fluctuated, I just thought it unlikely to fluctuate in the 1 hour it took me to do BitInstant and buy. Then the confirmation took way longer than I thought, I went to bed, woke up and it had changed.

lol? What do you propose.

It was on BMR- no, nothing illegal.
It seems they have their prices set in USD, and the BTC varies to match it. 
Also, it wasn't the purchase, but transferring to that wallet.

Right. I know that now.

Alright, thank you very much.
Doing the standard 30 minute/BitVisitor etc faucet stuff. I'll gamble tomorrow. Yes, I have no idea how borrowing would work.

I just seriously got into bitcoin yesterday, and converted a decent amount of money(4BTC) in order to purchase 4BTC worth of goods. With this slight dip, I can no longer afford it, and I do not get paid again for 2 weeks and need the product this week.
Suggestions? Last night I was fine, but it took a while for my transfer to my wallet to be confirmed. Woke up and BAM.

That's precisely what I did. However, it takes a few hours for network confirmation- which I did not know about, and during that period, the flash crash happened.

I've briefly looked at it, but I could benefit from further counsel if I am to risk it all.
Would this entail gambling it all, or simply a portion, if so, what portion?
