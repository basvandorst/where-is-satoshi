I think the original idea of POW was to stop email spam as the spammer would need a lot of computing power to send out all the email. 
In Bitcoin its the voting mechanism for what chain to use as the main one, and its backed with computing work. People can verify your work so its provable.

They can do what they want but it seems kinda weird to start a retail (I'm assuming its retail) cafe business when you are a new company working with experimental new currency. I would have a feeling that would have your hands tied up enough than to also start a coffee shop.
And it would have been nice to spend money and planing something more Bitcoin related, something that would feed into their core business.
I'm sure the shop will take Bitcoin and maybe some move where they only take Bitcoin. But I'm not sure if that's going to really change much of anything than a nice story that will get its 15 minutes of fame. 
Unless they want to start a chain of them. They could go for it but I personally feel that might be pushing their capability far, and I feel like Bitcoin has many other more importation issues than having more cafe shops take it. Or who knows, maybe the PR from those shops is what Bitcoin needs. Some business anyone can go to and easily go to and test out Bitcoin, maybe its not so bad of an idea.

Here is an experimental, new currency that's been under the radar for most of its life, and only started to get traction in the last two years. Its highly volatile and its legality to governments is on the fence. To properly secure it I have to do it myself, and have this learning curve that if I mess up I can loose all my money in a click of an attacker.
Oh what a nice place to store my wealth in..
I don't hate Bitcoin and I'm not saying it will never becomes something, but I feel its still really immature at this point, and is still growing. We still are on the hip coffee shops level, and I think it will be a while before it gets to a real level, if it gets there. But I guess it could, after improvements. 
I just feel like Bitcoin is a kid, and people what him/her to be president right now before growing up.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:43:56
I'm not really saying its worth it to mine at such a low profit but instead im here to defend the cards tech. I have been using some old cards and have been running it non stop at max rate for about 1/2 a year. And they run just as good as they did new. The damage you cause to a card is not bad as long as the temps are good. Cards that have been ran a long time with failed fans or in bad temps do die and will stop working properly. 
I feel people are losing way more on depreciation of the card.

I don't like this back and forth blame game, bullshit. It gets nothing done. Every time this is brought up I see post like your and others on both sides of the matter, its not true everyone is here to make fun of someone, and your post is the example. 
Regardless the exchange being crappy is not all of the community's fault either.  I really took this topic as a warning how the Bitcoin exchange ecosystem is today. And not as a punishment to it's users, but as a warning. 


I think we need to look at this. Bitcoin being what it is, as an open source, decentralized system, its whole being exists on its community. No one piece has complete power; its a sum of many parts. It being 'completely fucked' is everyone's problem who wants to take part in it. 
You will not agree with everyone who uses Bitcoin, and their will be a lot of assholes. But that's even more of a reason to stay in Bitcoin so its not dominated by them.
Bitcoin is anyone's responsibility that whats to take part in it. Its all volunteers.

So evil is still sacrificing something? I will say I really don't understand what you mean, I'm not saying you are wrong just that I don't understand. 
I just looked at as pool A + pool B can never earn greater than pool A + pool B. If one pool is trowing out power than the whole system between A and B will be less. A game of starving out the other.
I though you would say with good pool gone, bad pool could make more having the network to themselves. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:09:43
Edit: I removed my old post and want to explain better,
I'm wondering how well we know what blocks are coming from what source. I can image and attacker who does not like Bitcoin could pretend to be another pool making it seem like a pool could have greater than 50%, this could cause a loss of trust in the Bitcoin system without an attacker needing the full power of over 50% of the network. 
Now really the network would not really be compromised, which is why I ask how well can we know where blocks come from, and would any one really believe a private pool operator. 
Now I can see if the pool uses the same coinbase all the time then we would know who it is, but I'm not sure if pools do that. But even if they switch addresses they could sign a message to prove they own it. Anyway just wondering if something like this could happen.
How well do we know blocks are coming from?

Its not that really, you can pay taxes with Bitcoin but it is a indirect way than the fiat. But I do lots of indirect things to get my normal fiat to pay my taxes like work a job that has nothing to do with the taxes I pay. And their is not really a reason why a system could not take it directly.
The only reason to use Bitcoin is to use it for its properties that sets it apart from normal fiat. It being government independent is its main thing. If that makes it worth it is another matter.

Are you against me using too good of a password? But as I said this is the default size of the password of the system I'm using. I don't take the time to shorten it to make sure I only have enough entropy as the system can support. But yes, I don't remember them, I do store them and get them out when I need to use it. I copy and past them, if I'm on a system where I cant trust copy and pasting them then I don't trust the password box I am putting them into.
If I'm in a situations where I have to come up with a password I need to remember and it easy to type, I do something like (like when I can't copy and past):
These things might seem random but are tied to some things I can remember easily from life, I then practice it and remember it.  
Also I use this password system for other things that are not Bitcoin, but yes I do use both offline wallets and paper wallets. When I use a long passwords like I posted originally its for hot wallets. 
I'm also not saying everyone has to do what I'm doing to be safe. I will not force other people to do this or look down on people who do not. This is just a system that I like.

I was giving an example. My main idea was "The people with the most resources will still be able to get a lot of power and take a large % of the network." They are not the exact same thing but the same idea of getting more power with more resources. 
Yes I get how the entry level of off the shelf hardware makes it more accessible to the everyday end user, but I'm saying that does not matter. I know you are saying that makes it more of a level playing field but really that just changes how you have to scale, (with more space in this case). But its not what I'm going for, there is a reason I said car air fresheners in my next post.


Bitcoin was also worth a lot less than, and not many people cared. Its different now. As a said, when their is more incentive. Me playing around with my $1000 mining rig will never be on the same playing field as a multi-million dollar no matter what hardware is being used.
But forget the cards and ASICS, the people with a lot of resources can just buy a lot of coins hand hold a large % of the system. If your rich, your rich. You have a large centralization of value when your rich that you can exchange for other things.

But I do think their is a way to pool mining with only the intent to share the funds, like p2p pool or submitting blocks with the only having the same coinbase transaction can help.
But your right, Bitcoin is experimental and there are things that need to get fixed.

Windows, Linux. The main reason I use Windows is software compatibility and games. I use Linux because its free and I like to learn about software and computers. 
I have used Bitcoins on both and I feel just a little bit safer on Linux because I feel I have a little bit of a smaller attack surface. But today I use offline wallets, and in that case it does not matter that much.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:25:39
Sort of all fluff. There was nothing in there that really told me why Bitcoin is going to take off and why this price is cheap. Well nothing thats not super general.

@_date: 2014-01-29 02:59:42
If they have the private keys then yes. Blockchain.info I think only keeps an encrypted blob of your stuff. But I guess they could change how their website works and grab your stuff when you log in. Or an attacker who hacks them. Online wallets are not the best place to put coins.
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:22:24
I have not done enough research to really know. I see many people saying it is a problem and many saying its not. I'm more on the side of not sure but I think it could end up being bad. Non of this is vary scientific on my part, so my commit is fluff.

@_date: 2014-01-14 10:45:04
Sorry I edited my post a lot so you might have missed something. I do use paper wallets. I use my passwords for hot wallets when I want to move coins fast, I also use them for my Coinbase account with 2fa. 
Yes you are right, I do have to store them and make sure its a safe place. But I also do have a system for passwords that I have to remember. And I use which system I feel is the right one for the right time. 
The reason I don't remember all my passwords is that I don't always trust my memory. And if I'm not going to have to remember my password I just go overkill as it does not take any longer to copy and past. Also keep in mind I use this system for non Bitcoin things and its just me reusing my old system with Bitcoin now.
Anyway I have forgotten passwords before. Also if something happen to me I have left something so they could get into my old system and accounts. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:40:58
Ah, you see, Bitcoin has to get past people like to get anyplace. How many people do you think is in Bitcoin today because its "easy money. and oh and something about it being better than etc..". I'm just being realistic here.
So far with today's price Bitcoins is working for those kinds of people. Also I said maybe I, but it got your attention with it. ;)

I think the idea is in USD you have to do this to send money this conveniently, where in Bitcoin the cost is much less. 
But yes when sending someone USD like this you will need to do WU, but if Bitcoin ever becomes more widespread then that may be less of the case. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:35:07
1. Because their friend just made a lot of money off it and they want a cut too. Lets be honest here, the get rich fast holds more interest to an outsider. 
2. They believe in having a decentralized currency (and everything that comes with that) and its worth the hoops. And I will be honest and say that's the least reason why people are into it.
I feel everything else is just a combination and or extrapolation of those two things
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:54:11

Bitcoin is like the internet, if you want a two way connection then the other side needs to know where to send the data back too, and all of this information can be logged. The thing is you can hid who is using the computer, that's where the anonymous part comes in. But you have to work to get that, and Bitcoin can be more anonymous than it is now.
What Bitcoin has to offer is being decentralized and the implications of that. Its really neutral to who uses it. You don't have to like that, if thats worth it is up to the user.
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:48:34
One copy is not a backup. Make you you have it on different storage devices. Also do test you backups to make sure you did them right.  
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:21:48
My guess is there is some novelty to it. Maybe seeing it will give Bitcoin as something more serious. It could also be for people who want to buy in cash and not want to use local Bitcoin, could even be cheaper than many people on local Bitcoin.

I am not op, so ask him/her. But my guess is the point would be its harder pinning the coins to a specific person, but the wallets would be known. 
Its like a room of invisible people trading gold coins, you can see how much each person has and even when they transfer over, but not who or why. 
But with that said it takes work to be anonymous, in ops case today its just more anonymous because people will not take the time to look into any of it. Just my guess 
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:38:07
Its not so much ASICs and non ASIC coins. The people with the most resources will still be able to get a lot of power and take a large % of the network. If Bitcoin used something that was less ASIC friendly people would be making large GPU farms. Well they already are but even bigger.

Bitcoin security can be ok if you have a good idea of what you are doing. But the thing is a lot of people don't know, on top of that computer security is hard so its not always easy to learn. But it can be made to be more easy and secure.
Online banking has been used and tested with lots of people, so there is more experience there in the services and people who use them. And at worst if your robbed there is a way to get money back.

I think the original goal was everyone mined, and to do that you need a node (if you did not pool). So in a way you would. But today its not the case, I think thats why many alts want to make mining something everyone can do, idk if they can.

MtGox being down is a huge problem and hurts many people and Bitcoin's image. 
But also gox is not Bitcoin which is important for people to know. The truth is Bitcoin as of now is fine but gox does not have their shit together. But also be careful not to get to invested into something so new as Bitcoin. Someone else could become Gox2.
I tell anyone this who I tell about Bitcoin. I have sacred off more people than bring. But it was the best decision for them as of now.

I posted it on Reddit but its for anyone who wants to use Bitcoin and help it. By making it work better I mean fix the problems Bitcoin has, such as making new apps, services, security tools, and many more things Bitcoin needs. Or even just talking about it with people when appropriate. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 11:03:43
The main difference is its not tired to any traditional financial centralized system. It is distributed to anyone who wants to take part. Everything else can be implemented if someone wants too. 
All the implications of that make Bitcoin what it is. Why someone should care or not about that is another topic but a good one, and I'm not saying you have to care. It's fine if Bitcoin is not for you.
@_date: 2014-01-14 07:42:58
Yeah its not a good idea to trust an unconfirmed transaction. Should wait for at least one confirmation.

Yeah, also when I tell someone about Bitcoin I never come at them as if this is the best thing in the world. I come at them telling them the truth and that there are risks and problems that need to be sorted out.

Yeah your right, they could get "hacked" or in other words bribed as you said. Also I don't even know how well the pool's security is. It might be cheaper to really just hack them. All this power in one spot is not a good thing.

It would suck to lean that he use mtgox as his main wallet. 
Anyway You are going to have to find out what kind of wallet he used to keep his coins. Do no share any numbers or passwords with anyone that you find. If you find gibberish text keep that safe and away.
Other than that lean the basics of Bitcoin independent for anyone who tells you anything here. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 07:49:50

What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-03-15 12:20:36
The main idea is how Bitcoin or most things open source is that the protocol is open and that is legal to make your own Bitcoin software. As of now we are putting a lot of trust into one place but we don't have to. And its the "we don't have to" that makes this different. 
I would not mine if there where other people working independently working on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-14 09:42:37
Its not like I am buying a $300 to lock up my $25 watch, a password is free. Why not take the best?
Yeah you are right that this is more entropy than the private key itself, but this is a time where I don't care about overkill. Sorry that I used too good of a password but its not any harder for me to use this over another password with the system im using (passwords of this size are the default), the cost of this overkill is nothing to me. I do take precautions to make sure I don't loose passwords, and I have not before. But if I did I would really be fucked.

This is for anyone and can help you keep your Bitcoins safe. Download  
Than go to  and read "How to make offline transactions using your Master Public Key"
This will keep your private keys offline. Please keep all passwords long (&gt; 20), symbols, numbers, mixed case. And most importantly something that will never show up in a google search. Or you may use 
Hope this helps someone.

You all here really make a big deal out of nothing.
OP, as a "Bitcoiner" I do understand. I hate being labeled and grouped as if one part means every one acts that way. I just want to say not every "Bitcoiner" thinks what the local vocal section of what is.  
To "Bitcoiner", basically give Bitcoin 30+ years, if its still around and working (and if Buffett is) then he may change his mind. He is conservative and Bitcoin today does not fit into that group.

I will say I find the way Bitcoins was given out may have not been the best way with the halving. I think its one of the more experimental parts of the protical.

We could make the phone ecosystem more safe, but if we don't why cant we just have a hardware wallet built into the phone? I understand that at first when bitcoin is small its not going to happen, but later on.

The incentive of running a Bitcoin node is to make Bitcoin work better. But I understand how that really does not mean much, why a normal person should run a node is not really that important. Grandma does not need to know what a node is.
I think what the goal was in the past was everyone ran a node and everyone mined some. This would keep it from centralizing and would help the network out. But that did not happen and now people only need to use services that gives you the wallet and the people who mine are really specialized. Though I guess that was know from the start also.

I forgot what it was called but isn't there this crypto that will let you use someone elses computing power without them knowing what they are computing. The idea is you could get cloud power without the people hosting it know what you are doing. I wish I remembered more.

Or in other words its difficult to get a good difficulty. :)
But yes, difficulty as in the minimal threshold for a block to be accepted depending on the maximum target divided by current target (which is adjusted every 2016 to get around a block every 10 mins) At the time of posting that is 1,180,923,195.
Then we have the difficulty that the block actually is which can be greater than the first on I said. The last block at time of posting was 1,180,923,195.26. 
Also when I say "added difficulty" I mean the sum of the difficultly of the chain of blocks, as I understand it the chain that's accepted is the one with the most sum of difficulty of all the blocks in it.

I would say this drives miner incentive away unless you have a lot of money and can invest in making something much more powerful than on the market today. But for most people its just not economical as you will not make a ROI. 
My guess to the reason there is so much power might be people who bought hardware and are just now getting it. People experimenting with it after hearing about it after SR case. And many other things.
Non of this is bad for the network. It just makes it harder to tamper with. 
Is this bad in general for bitcoin? No, the mining part is to be the support infrastructure for Bitcoin. The main reason is to use Bitcoin as a type of money and even if the hashing power tappers off Bitcoin will still be usable.

I have another question, does the network accept blocks older than the current winning chain as long as the replacement blocks difficulty is higher than current?

The main idea behind them is not so much of the the functionality of the system but the fundamentals of the system. Normal fiat systems are easy to use an are accepted everywhere. Even if Bitcoin became accepted everywhere it would not be much better at just the spending/getting process. But that's not the point of it. The point of Bitcoin is a system that sort of is everyone for them self's (as in you can do what you want with your money, internet cash) but also all must work together to keep the network going. You have more freedom over your money, also how the system works is more transparent.
Bitcoin is the Linux of money, does for the most part anything Windows or OSX can do but you have much more freedom. If that helps any, also I keep saying freedom too much.

What makes Bitcoin different is that its a money system that works without a centralized system, the why is because the maker did not like banks or how old money worked, the how is the blockchain and etc. 
What you should do is learn as much about Bitcoin as you can (if you care too). Then when you talk to someone you can read them and tell them what they are interested in a tailored explanation based on your Bitcoin knowledge and what they care about.

I think that's a great thing to take about, internet and computers is not something most people can get. And Bitcoin needs those things to work.

Yeah you could do something with like a smartphone and use its data I guess to buy the internet but I still find it a shortfall. Such as if my phone is out of juice. I don't have one. Or the internet on the phone is bad right now which is why I want to use wifi.

The first letter or number normally gives it away for what it is. Also addresses have some error detection in them as long as the software makes sure to check it.
I think this is true but LTC starts with a L, Bitcoin normally starts with a 1, and PPC starts with a P, Dogecoin with a D. Not all alts are like that but I hope that helps.

why is this?
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:14:02
When you say BTC wallet I'm assuming you are just booting QT and its saying a error about something being corrupted. 
This is most likely the QT blockchain you have downloaded and this sort of thing does happen from time to time. First thing is to backup your wallet.dat  . make a copy of it off that harddrive like onto a flashdrive. Next make sure your QT is up to date. Then you can try just deleating your data directory (make sure you backed up your wallet.dat!!) and redownloading your blockchain. 
That should work. But if you mean your wallet file and I dont know.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:11:31

The main thing that sets Bitcoin apart from normal money is that its not regulated by a central system. Other than that It does anything normal money can do. 
If you don't care about that than Bitcoin is not for you, and their is nothing wrong with that. No one should have to use Bitcoin if they don't want to.

I think you made a great post. The cost of trust is important. And the way Bitcoin does it as you point out may not be the best way to do this.
I'm wondering though, from what I remember signing transaction cost little. So if more people start to use Bitcoin it would not make mining cost go up that much. Meaning it could get much cheaper per transaction if more people start using Bitcoin. Or at least that what I think, correct if wrong.

Depends, I could sell it and get money now even though it may make more in the future. This could protect me if the market starts to fail. I would shift the risk off to someone else since mining takes time.

If you are saying that because you are wondering if we will run out of Bitcoins, then I'm here to say we have a lot of them now; and that they can be divided so it will take a lot of wrong addresses sending before it becomes a problem.

I do already have some BTC, so I do have a starting point. I just sort of guessed you where giving this because you might have thought I did not have any. Accepting it made me feel kinda greedy, and I though about giving it away but I felt kinda weird taking your money just to regive it away. I also bad experiences from excepting money from friends in the past also.

What are you going to do with it?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:03:45
Make sure you are fine with loosing all this money. This is risky. Buy some Bitcoins and keep it in storage. Spend some also so you get use to how it work, this also helps merchants know they are not wasting their time.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:52:51

Banks money is insured to some degree and do get hacked once in a while. But all they need are logs to see what happen to the money.
Bitcoins are in this case like gold, places that have gold have to have a large safe. In Bitcoin all you need is a offline wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:46:47

Its just a extra step, if someone finds your paper or somehow it leaks from your computer or a printer (like lets say it gets stuck in a cache memory someplace) then you would still be safe as long as you use a good pw. But you don't have to.

Ereaders like the kindle are harder to use than a book but bring other things to the table. I dont think time is the main factor here.

Computer security sucks. Computers have not been around that long and I think its just going to take time before people lean. I do think computer security will get better as more people work on it, and with people growing up with computers we will start to lean whats good and not. 
Bitcoin isn't doomed because my mom cant understand it. Newer generations will come that have a better hold of the matter.

Doesn't my network expand out once i connect to the default 8 and get list of other networks? Isn't that the point of peer to peer part of Bitcoin?
Also if more people run nodes doesn't that help with security if people try to run a bunch of bad nodes (like manipulate transaction timings that can help with a race attack, or other bad things).
And yeah you need to have ports open. I run Bitcoin QT and looking up my IP it seems I have relayed many transactions which is what a node is for right?
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:22:38

There isn't really, which is why I had to ask questions about people seeing how the $20 was involved. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:27:49
Well that would depend on the situation. Some of these people dont have the space, power, internet, to use the computer. Plus you have to gather up these pc, then ship them all over the world, and then teach them how to use them. It might be better to scrap the pc and sell the scrap and use that money for other things that could help them. 
I'm not saying its bad for them to have computer, just that its going to be really hard thing to do.
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:13:27
To be fair, you are right that this could cause what OP is talking about.

Yes, you use power to make the miners do something.

Ok thanks for that, is there a universal way of doing this? I knew there must have been some way because of all those offline hardware wallets being made.
@_date: 2013-10-17 00:47:39
Well people say Bitcoin but are there alternatives people know of that they will jump to first?
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:01:25
Local I guess
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:18:13
I find it to be. The bigger they are the harder they fall. If Bitcoin's name goes in people heads followed with news of how it lost a bunch of value it will heart its rep. And looking at its growth now I'm thinking just that will happen. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:49:24
Bitcoin is more like a debit card. How are their fees?
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:16:35
Well that's more of semantics. When do you count as a transaction is made? Technically yeah, you made out your transaction offline. I will give you that. Like writing a check. But really I feel its not a done deal till it hits the blockchain.  You have to trust people, but I will agree though, off the chain transactions is can be useful. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:22:25
Bitcoin should be thought of as internet cash. 
Just like normal cash once you give it to someone you can't get it back. Services can be made to make this more safe. Like an escrow. 
You should never carry all your cash in an unsafe place like out in the open or on your person, or in Bitcoin terms on a online wallet or other hot wallet.
You should keep most of your cash in a safe. In Bitcoin its called cold storage. You are your own bank.
Why should the normal person care about Bitcoin? Well to people who already like Bitcoin the more people that accept them the easier it gets to use like normal money. What Bitcoin has to offer that other system don't is just being non government regulated and fast to move with low fees. Its definitionary and ran by anyone.
Now if you even care about any of those things is up you or anyway who wants to get involved. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:56:52

Some people might not think a QR code looks nice, but using a NFC device will let you have any fabulous design you want. :) 
In NFC you don't have to focus a camera on an image (I have had trouble with a small QR codes and my shit camera). And NFC works without having much light in the room. 
I don't think any of these things are reasons why to use it over QR code. Maybe to use with QR code, but nothing I said is a strong reason to dich QR codes.

1. Maybe a vary small 0-3 customers that will take it up on novelty. At least today, no idea about the future.
2. Its one more way to take people's money. The rest would depend on the owners, what do they care about and does Bitcoin do to help them. If they don't like anything it does than it does not really help. 
3. I have no idea.
4. Maybe the people at number 3 can help you with that, but I don't know also.
5. Well it depends, do they care about Bitcoin, do they think it has anything that will benefit anyone.  
This is some anecdotal stuff but if there was a Honda dealership close by me and I had the coins to buy a car and it was not a bad deal I would.
@_date: 2013-09-23 05:36:08

If I made a list of people that are in places with no internet but have a smartphone with NFC then it would not have names on that list. Yeah you could just use a laptop and usb drive also.
There is something to say about offline transactions and I do agree they are useful making Bitcoin something you can partly use offline. But its sort of as good as making a I Owe You till you have internet again. Which sort of turns Bitcoins into a check. Which may be good enough for your uses at the time. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:26:03
yeah you could say that. just like gmail was in beta for years
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:54:20
Normal cash is also irreversible. The thing with Bitcoin is a service could be made like a Visa card that instead of it paying in USD it pays in Bitcoins. But that will come with a cost like it does today. Most things that can be done with normal money can be done with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:28:00
Well no to what? But is seems you would answer anything that would keep you with the Bitcoins you have. Yes crime is subjective, anything we think is subjective relative to the world. Yes current culture has many double standers. The 'people don't make laws, only physics can' sort of post.
Different subject but it reading your ending line it makes me feel like you would want people to be able to do anything they want because its all subjective. Does that mean you would not like any sort of system with authority regardless of how the rules come about.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:00:09
They are trying to show how they are less prone to 'getting hacked' themselves like some other online wallets in the past. But you still have to keep your account safe, 2FA please use it.
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:25:08
Its not a bad idea and I was thinking this would come one day. I think this will help keep people from sending money to the wrong people and also make it a little bit more easy to send Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:41:15
Right now Bitcoins main value is what you can trade it for in other currencies. Thats the truth today. 
But think about it, why do you use normal money? What gives it its value? Well I'm sure its because you know you can take that money and get other things with it. If you could not I'm sure you would not want to be paid in them. We use money because bartering can be a pain in the ass. Money is a generic middle ground of value.
We (people who like Bitcoin) are trying to make Bitcoin like that. But why Bitcoin over normal money? What Bitcoin has going for it is that its not centralized, and is government neutral (as in not ran by one). It also has low fees compared to some other ways you can pay people. But if you don't care about these things than I will say it, Bitcoin is not for you. And nothing is wrong with that.
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:08:47
Just like USD users.
@_date: 2013-08-24 18:19:20

@_date: 2013-11-10 15:30:16
1. The people who are really interested in it and just way they want it to be the next big thing.
2. The point of Bitcoin is to be a money system ran by anyone and is not regulated by the normal central government. This means its much less regulated. The most commend uses today of that today is sending money anyplace fast. (the end goal is to have so many people accept Bitcoin that you don't need to convert it. Thats a WIP) Making a Bitcoin wallet requires no info given on the users part. Also their is low fees. You can be your own bank.
3. The creator of Bitcoin just made papers on how a system would work. Then he made some code showing how it worked in practice. Sort of just like blueprints. And in these Blueprints the only way to make money is mining. If he wanted to make his own money he would have to make another Bitcoin that is incapable with this one and then get a lot of people to use it over this one. 
4. Bitcoin is a defiance currency meaning there is a finite supply. The whole thing could work the same way if we only had 1 coin. We can use fraction of a coin, we just use smaller and smaller subdivisions. 
5. Well i'm not sure what you mean? Bitcoin is information and the tools we use to process information is a computer. Another thing is that are financial system already relies heavenly on computers.
6ish, the government can have its hands in it when it comes to trading fiat to Bitcoin and back as they are the regulators of fiat. Other than that they have just as much power in the system as anyone else. But they do have more recourse than anyone else so they could try to mess things up that way.

What are some ways you plain on using Bitcoin to pay for your things? Like what services will you be using?
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:09:45
That was only one question I asked. So if you had money and you found out later it was tainted you would still spend it on someone else who did not know it was tainted. 
What about the other questions? Keep in mind I never said any of this was good or bad. Just want people thinking.

I'm not sure what you mean. When it comes to mining taking peoples transactions is the easy part. Its just finding one that matches the difficulty that's the hard part. If some people stopped mining the difficulty would go down and people with less hardware could get more blocks. So even if there are less miners the network could keep running.
I think even I could alone with my setup keep the network running and processing all the transactions at today's rate. I don't have much power, someone could easily have more power than I do. I could not keep away a 'double spend' attack. Which is the main problem with a weak hashrate network.

I think people are talking about the starting people who bought bitcoins in fiat to start making it "valuable". But as for the starting miners I'm not sure. 


I don't fully understand the system so I could be wrong. To start there is difficultly that goes up as more power is added to the network. The system can also be upgraded if enough people agree on it so if this is too weak then they can change it.
The coins may come at a consistent rate but people want a lager % of that rate, so they want more hashing power to get it. This also helps make the network more safe from the 51% attack. So sort of a built in incentive to make people want to keep Bitcoins safe.
The mining is how the starting currency is entered into the system. it
A. give people incentive to run the network. They could get paid by mini and doing transactions 
B. tries to distribute the wealth by being a random reward system.
C. once all the free coins are mostly mined transaction fees can start taking the place it,
There is more to Bitcoin than this and I may have messed up some thing. There are a lot of 50% gotchas in Bitcoin because its a peer to peer system that's not centralized and works off what the majority are doing.

Bitcoin is new, Bitcoin is like a baby animal leaning to walk. Oh how will this animal ever walk if it just stumbles everywhere? Maturity can fixed this; if it can make it there.
I think Bitcoin might stay all over the place but till end up getting much more predicable. Much less huge percent changes in a day. It will have to or it might die, like that baby animal, or be used for something else than currency.

Its easy (not as in understanding, but as in the act of doing it) to move the money around. Lower fees in many cases. And its government neutral meaning no government controls it. If you don't care about any of those things than Bitcoin is not for you, and nothing is wrong with that.

I'm not defending OP clams or clamming POW is something new. As I said "Bitcoin did not invent the underlying technologies". 
As for the last part of the post I was just saying without electricity are modern banking system would take a big hit in how it works. But yes we had money before electricity/ or internet and we could go back to that. I know banking is done today in parts of the world without power and that are system could work without it, but I really would not call thats modern. We could not keep going without a problem. Not having electricity is a big deal. 
Also I'm not defending Bitcoin about this also, it would be useless in a environment without it.

As for mr kruman, It seems like throwout the price he it taking this as his anaylist. But this is what really gets me is 


He also seems to end in questions, and yes it is clear he is not on the pro side, but all I wanted to say was it did not seem like he is nailed down on the evil idea. Though it seems we agree on that.

Bitcoin sort of sucks and does not work until there is big adoption. Who wants to use money that works on way less than 1% of stores around the world?

Yeah your right about the deflation part, it just said it because it was a big characteristic about Bitcoin that is not that commend in other types of money. But yeah your right that's something on its own away from Bitcoin.
Mining is the only way to get new coins, its how the money is disrupted. Its also how the money is secured.

I think the idea of less confirmation time is even though its backed by less computing power that might be good enough for some transactions. The limbo between blocks is lessen, if that's worth it is something else. It may not be.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:20:45
Just because its popular does not mean its right. I'm not calling meme posts something that are evil but the concept of its being popular makes it ok is something I don't like.

I would do Coinbase. I have used them for smaller amounts of money and they have worked fine. Or if you really want to use local Bitcoins do smaller transactions to really test the trust. So if one fails you don't loose all your money.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:05:20


I think this is the main question. Someone with a lot of resources could get a lot of Bitcoins and mess with the system. But that is true of any system, if someone has a lot of power they and push others around.
We basically feel today that it would be hard for someone to easily get the power needed to disrupt Bitcoin. 
At the start It was a gentleman's agreement not to fuck up Bitcoin, that works because it was just a small amount of people using it who wanted it to work. Today it is almost sort of like that. Other than that it works on the agreement that people will be better off working together not against the network. They think if they don't mess up Bitcoin today than later on it will bring them more than if they did. 
I don't know if that helps any.

No, I never said that or assumption that. I mean the quite opposite really. All I said was I cared about my dieing, not that other people will care about my dieing as much as I do. Which is why I think me dieing would be a blip in history, vary small one. :)

I do think so also. When making the questions it became apparent how different Bitcoin is in some parts. When I get normal money I don't really care where it comes from more than the person who gave it to me. Nor there is really a system to find out more than that. 
Bitcoin does give more information to see where its been since its birth into the blockchain, not if that path to me matters is the topic of this topic.

Then we don't stop mining. TBH, I'm not sure what you are asking. The problem I see that could happen is the TPS get too high and it starts taking a lot of bandwidth and only big server with big HDD can really run Bitcoin.
We would need a altcoin that scaled better or fix Bitcoin for that.

I kind of knew what you where doing, I just don't think the way you are doing it is effect. If you linked to someplace where its already been discussed I think that would be better. I feel your comments do what you want to stop for the circle jerkers but instead in a anti circle jerkers way. 
I feel your talking points are too shallow in information and downgrading to people which does not help them. If you linked out to a discussion that you feel is relevant they can understand better than just repeating what they say and then saying you don't like it or that its not relevant. 
Or in other words I feel like you are doing the same thing they are just on the other side of the argument. Even if you are right I don't think the way you do it will change many minds at are too circlejerky.


I just wanted to say that made me lol.
As for Krugman I think the title is just link bait thats working well, it really seems hes just trying to work out Bitcoin and is siding with a safe side. Which I think is fine.

So the meaning of this ATM is to handle physical cash. After you use it, it gives you a code that you take and use online to then move coins. Or in a way a more optimized way to buy and sell Bitcoins in cash without doing something like money packs (whatever they are called) and using local Bitcoins.

Salted from what I understand is just something automatically added on by a service to make it more resistant to rainbow table attacks when there is a database leak. 
Its not really something the end user does anything about, salting a password to them is no different then just added on more stuff to a password in that case. Anyway just semantics.
As for xkcd thing. I think the point was a long odd combinations of words is better than a sort complex password. If anything it is talking about Diceware (taking the comic to its con, its just that adding all that extra detail doesn't make a good comic.

For your question a lot has to to with it being first and most well know. Its also being the most used because of its strong start. It also has been around a while and because of that has gotten more trust. 
Also ideas made in alts cam be adapted in Bitcoin. Alts are not a bad thing, they can be testing grounds if we don't want to do something that might disrupt Bitcoin since so fare its working ok. If a alt takes over that's better than thats good, we get a better system.

If you use a weak password it will always be weak. 
A brainwallet is a hashed password, if you put coins in there anyone with the blockchain can guess it.
In a Truecrypt your password is used to encrypted the main key thats used to encrypted the container. If your container stays on your pc then its a little safer just because its not on the internet (unless you uploaded it to someplace anyone can get to). 
But really you should use a good password for both.

So I guess the question is how are we going to pay for keeping the network running and its safety once all the free giveaways are low/out. 
I think this is a great question. What it looks like you are saying is that running the network does not cost much. Then I guess the question would be how much security would we need and who and how would people pay for it.
This is my guess; mining will become nonprofit and will be supported by transaction fees. The fees will be bases on the network’s activity, how much the network cost to run and whatever hash rate the community thinks it will take to keep the network safe. The byproduct we get out of this is to be able to use a system like Bitcoin. I’m being really general about the whole thing, and I have not fully thought it out. But it makes me think.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:52:30

As a side note there is a , anyway it would matter if you are in a pool or you are mining alone. If you are in a pool you will get paid depending what their method is but it will more often, could be daily even. If you mine alone you will just get coins when you get lucky and get a block. You need a lot of power to do that well. 
Anyway I think the real question will be is if its worth it. I think at this point its hard to find a miner bought new that will get money back on its investment.

As OP said Bitcoin was on of the first attempts and it may be shit, the underlying ideas can still be used and tweaked to make something better. 
Also how would you fix the problem of that happening anyway?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:16:52
Converting to USD, and sometimes random other things. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:47:55
If you're extra paranoid. 
If you don't trust Bitcoin-qt implementation of encryption (like scared they messed it up somehow (idk it could be perfect, that can be verified.)), or maybe you want to use other non popular methods. Use TwoFish for example on truecrypt.

@_date: 2013-12-29 20:40:32
I never said not to bother because they are not perfect. I even said it was debatable, and did not pick a side. I only said to keep it in mind, that we should think about these things.
The point of was to tell people don't get too themselves that Bitcoin is the end all to all problems financial. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 20:07:37


I feel its the other way around. Peer to Peer sort of helped cause this.

@_date: 2013-12-24 01:58:02
Miners will, because A. If they stop Bitcoin looses all its value and investment on Bitcoin mining hardware will be lost. But if they don't care about Bitcoin than B. Transaction fees are rewarded to the minder who finds the block. So they get money for running the network. The network will have to find a equilibrium of hash rate to profitability.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:08:53
Why such hard feelings?
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:39:54
Basically you have the idea. You can own and manage your own money under your control. So yeah you could just take all of your normal money out of the bank and do it yourself.
What I think the phrase is really saying is encouraging you to be your own bank. And that Bitcoin can help you do that. There is a strong anti bank vibe around Bitcoin.

You came back just to push it in their faces in a rude manner. You said you are "laughing at them". You came back just to get enjoyment out of making fun of someone else. And I think that makes someone an ass. 
That does not make your judgement on the market wrong or your past warnings wrong, I also think its just a bubble, but I'm not mean about it.

I think the point is quiditvinditpotdevin is making is we are doing this willing. When I use my dollar bill it may be "tainted" but I did not mean that or know that when I got and used it. 
Here we are trading money around to make all money look tainted. We might be doing it to shake the tail off regulation but this also does help to people who originally tainted the coins.

Basically Bitcoins are information, you can use almost anything to store information. Computers are the tools we use most of the time for are information needs, and with the internet it makes it easy to send this information.
Is information valuable? Well touch your hand to your head and feel your skull. Its a protective barrier your body has to keep safe an organ that's essentially an information storing and processing machine. Yes its important. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:30:26
You don't need the blockchain to use Bitcoin. There are clients out there like Electrum that do not need you to download the Blockchain. 
Hard drives are growing in size and the blockchain can be pruned. 
I do feel if Bitcoin gets big the only people who are going to manage nodes are ones with large bandwidth and space. But thats still way out form now.

I'm not defending doge coin as its just a joke but I'm against your reasoning.

Fair is subjective, some people do think trust is needed.
That does not mean we cant have a system like you explain. It actually means we can have any system. But if you can convince people to accept it is the hard part.

If you could guarantee it then I would not spend it for at least 3 weeks. If it stopped after 50% I would spend it. If it was risky then I may use it before 3 weeks. If it it kept going on forever then at some point I will cash it out because I don't want to die and not use any of my money.

No, I don't want that. At most for me they can keep it if I can encrypt it with a PW and I just that and they keep it. But I want TNO trust no one. But I understand you want to make it easy for people, I think you can make it more safe without making that company a honey pot. 
The rest sounds fine but I find a mobile phone also works. In the future phones could be made with Bitcoin or Bitcoin systems in mind. Even have a low power mode to make sure it works even when the phone is "dead."

I don't know, if I have a key to a lockbox that holds $10000000 and I take that over into another country what are the implications?
I know Bitcoin is not 1:1 to this as its information and what I talked about was physical but I think it can somewhat compare. The blockchain is a like a lot of lock boxes and finical records that can exists on any piece of matter that holds that information, like a hard drive. And your key is the key to unlock those boxes. Difference is this is information and can flow much more easily than your $10000000.
To me I think its going to be up to the country and its exchange when you what to move the coins out. You asked a good question and I dont know the answer. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 19:08:50

Seems like its little older but it makes it look like it could scale with some changes. That's good. What is the TPS of Bitcoin now? I guess I can look it up myself.  so using this and division about 0.64. Got some ways to go.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:56:05
Its ether we are moving it to something other people are use to or keeping it something we are use to. I personally find using uc or mc or whatever SI prefix not a bad idea. Bitcoins is already a new money system and the point of metric is to try and make everything look the same.
Bitcoin also being deflationary I think it also makes resalable we are using a smaller and smaller unites. But whatever wins out someone has to get use to it.

When you send a transaction and then you try to send another one (using the same money in the first) the good nodes will reject one of them because they don't allow a double spend. The transaction that makes it into the winning block is the one that is confirmed. The block also has rules that it must follow, or the nodes will not accept it. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:56:16
So I read it, it never goes into why its evil. If anything it sounds like he just not like the explanation that people give him. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:16:42


To be fair most computer security in places is like this. The difference is they have insurance. 


Some of this is this way because no one really cared about Bitcoin when it started and the infrastructure never grew past geek. Some of these things seem weird because we never done them before. It might seem weird in the future about things we did in the past. 


This is the internet, not a company. People will say anything. Does not make it wrong or right, just the way it works.
Computer security as a whole is really a shitty thing most people don't understand. And when fuckups happen and a company is involved they pay for it to keep business. When things happen and only the user has control they are permanent, Bitcoin is one of those things. 
Services could be made to keep your Bitcoin safe that looks like the old stuff we know. And yes they are going to make a lot of money.

I wish they had an option where I could lock my account for a certain amount of time (like a mouth or a year or something) to only be allowed to send Bitcoins to one address or a select few that I put into the website. That way if someone gets in and tries to send Bitcoin they can only send it to me. 
It does not have to be timed, maybe unlocked some other way.

When I said Bitcoin can do about the same thing I know in details they are different. Which is why you would want to use one over another. But to the little guy doing normal buys it does not differ too much. I was more talking that way to the Frankeh because of the examples he was talking about.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:03:33
About what?
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:16:55
This could be all misinformation that I'm about to say because I got this from other reddit post on this sub. But what it looks like is China is not letting banks touch Bitcoin and in their books Bitcoin is not a currency (I guess that's how they look at it legally). 
I heard on a personal level they don't care what you do with it and at the business level I have no idea. 
People of China can still use it as a currency just not with the banks. Or at least that's what I gather. There could be a lot of rose tinted in that.
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:12:08

You can add all you want. Just make sure to spend it all at once. Like send to another address you own.

2 BTC? You can buy like 2000 USDs with that!
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:46:03
You can summit the block yourself, but the problem is the first transaction in the block (which gets the reward) is to the pool, you can change that to yourself but you would have to refined a block that works for your address, no different from solo mining now. As others point out there is more to it and a real pool handles it in a different way, but this gives the idea.
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:15:52
Mined 1 coin and cashed it in for $30 back when it was worth that. I still have more, it was not that big of a deal.

No, not in USD.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:35:04
I left what crime it is out of that because of that. But I even asked a question later on if the crime did matter. 
So in that question you quoted a crime would be something you would think is one and is of concern enough to question the money or not.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:49:44
Yeah you are just about right, 4 accounts not posting shit ;)
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:36:57
There is a finite number of addresses. But its close to 1.4615016e+48. And the protical could be change to allow more. We can safely use a new address each time.
@_date: 2013-10-14 03:48:52
So I would be using log on to my log on? I don't mean to sound condescending I can understand the use case. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:29:16
Or everyone who has a copy of the Blockchain owns all of them, but only knows how to unlock a few. I like saying that one better.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:04:57
People can do whatever they want and they will. 
I just feel that using this "to the moon" thing is just a small joke that will be around for a small amount of time. And that it represents this time in the community (which I feel was not the best time to be reminded off anyway, I mean the Bitcoin progress is good, just not how acted.)
I know you can get a tattoo removed but to use something so permanent for something so silly seems crazy to me. But its not my body. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:56:53
So this is if a big pool wants to kill a small pool and make some money for a bit. This could work but it seems like a better deal for the miners just to switch to pool B if its paying more than A. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:10:50
After listening to Steve for years I feel like he is a mediocre security guy who is just does this as his side hobby, sort of like all the Twit podcast. I still like it but I know what to filter. I have my own stance on security but he has opened me up some things to look into, like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-10 13:18:32
nah dog, sorry
@_date: 2013-09-28 22:56:57
If I left a pile of cash laying on a table out in public with no protection and someone walked up to it and took it that would still be stealing. Anyone could be using that table like anyone could be using your wallet. Protecting your Bitcoins with a weak password is sort of the same way.
Now proving that was your money and that someone stole it is a different matter. The person who lost it is screwed. Don't uses weak passwords. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:07:58
I think it would be a good idea if when people hit the send button it only sent a vary small amount of BTC fits. Then the website/wallet says yes that's the right address and then it sends the rest. 
Or maybe we can make something to name addresses other than stuff we have in a addresses book. Like I click send and it says I'm sending to x. Bad people could just fake x if they where scamers but I think it could also help.
But I have had many times where I though I sent coins to the wrong address. Most of the time I use my addresses book but when im sending it to places I have not used before I can get confused and past a wrong address. Luckily I have not lost any coins to it.
@_date: 2013-10-26 03:08:50

I guess just say the word cap in front of the letters that are, and just assume its not if otherwise. Or use only hex or some other style that does not have upper and lower case. 
Then I guess you can put it in a TTS and just save the audio file.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:40:16
I have been around Bitcoin when it was worth about $1 but I still find it a quite a bit risky. This year it really has started gain more attraction. 
I still will probably not really trust it for a few more years to see how it plays out. For me I would not use it as savings.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:11:56
So these are not leaf nodes? 
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:46:18
So is waiting for confirmations (greater than 1 I mean) is forking protection? Like to make sure your coins end ups up with the winning chain?
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:57:17
nah nah, I just used Coinbase. I still have my coins.

No, I think it would not unless they were mining. But it helps if some people where trying to run bad nodes.
@_date: 2013-10-14 02:43:14
From just looking at it form a glance it seems like a bad idea. I mean the master key is suppose to be private and aren't Bitcoin addresses public? At least they are when you start sending funds around to them. But there could be something i'm overlooking. 
And when it comes to sending money cant anyone do that as long as they know the address? Would that only be safe if no one knew your accounts? Edit: Oh I guess it would matter what address your sending it from. idk
I don't fully or partly understand how Bitcoin works. So I'm not sure.

I think other things need to be considered, once money is involved in something that was bad that does not mean it cant ever be used again or used at all.
Cash money was made at a time when tracking like this was not really possible or practical. Today the the electrical banking system does have tracks,
Bitcoin works in a different way than most other money does. 
All I'm saying is there is more to the matter than one black and white satire story.

I do think most people should not even think about mining and just move on to buying Bitcoin and using it. But I disagree with the absolutism in your post. People can find fun in anything. People find enjoyment in things that have no monetary roi all the time. I own figures of cars and other things that do nothing more than sit on a self. I get the enjoyment of looking at them and things they remind me of. And I know that's not for everyone.
I also think you can have fun an learn with mining. Lean about what asic hardware is, lean about the mining software. Lean about pooling and how the payout method works. Lean how to keep good up time and hardware management.
People find fun in anything. There are many simulator video games which are just jobs with no real life money pay afterwards. And they are a active experience you have to partake in.
I did early gpu mining long ago but today I own a $20 Satoshi stick. I got it as a novelty item because I feel that it was way cooler than a Bitcoin shirt or cup or whatever they get printers to print on today. It does something related to Bitcoin and it looks kinda neat IMO, and its a little bit of Bitcoin history. 
Though it was always a shitty device that never made a roi, this was what many peoples first drive into the Bitcoin world was. Even a landmark of what asic where at the time, not vary useful. I will mine with it till the pool cant see it anymore or it just breaks or something. Then just put it back in its plastic case and leave it on my shelf where I display stuff I find neat.
I got enjoyment out of that.

How much would a decentralized currency help? What are the effects of deflation on the currency of a economy? Does Bitcoin even do these things well? What are the effects of mining (such is there other ways that use less resources? Or is it even a problem? How will mining effect people, etc etc)
@_date: 2013-09-10 13:24:55
Bitcoin is in a catch 22, stores wont use it because people don't use it, and people don't use it because stores done use it. No one gets paid in it because not one using it. That's why right now there is not much you can do with it like you said. But each new thing that comes out makes it a little close to not that, or at least is a try.
Bitcoin does not have a simple quick and easy ways to see the difference between it and fiat. Bitcoin at first looks cant really do anything much better than fiat can now. But the fundamentals are different and that's the point of it.
The point of Bitcoin is to be something else than fiat if you don't trust it now or down the road. Other than that it does not have much advantages. So if you don't care about that than yeah its not for you, and that's fine I'm not going to force anyone to use it.
Bitcoin and Fiat are like Linux and Windows. Technically they can do just about the same thing. They differ in that Linux is ran by and changed by anyone. Windows is whatever Microsoft makes it. Most people don't care that much and use Windows like fiat, it was first (ok not historically true, but in the way what came popular first) and worked well enough. But if Linux gets more software people use and Microsoft keeps making Vistas and Windows 8s than it may have been a good idea to always have had an alternative like Linux/Bitcoin.

Well this goes back to my first post. So you want help try and wreck some of "Self-fueled hype" to "de-legitimize this scam." But why do you care about wrecking this scam? To help people not get scammed? But you said you did not care.
But even if you are trying to help somehow I don't think that sort of comment would help achieve what you want. I think the people you want to get at will ignore it, like I said in the original post.

At some point I want to spend at least some of it before I die (because its boring to have money and do nothing with it) or in my will give it off to someone else. 
And at some point I will fell like I have so much money that spending a little would not make that big of a difference. 
If this was the only money I had I would only spend it on things I really needed and I would do less wasteful things with it. At Least until I got rich. I have already spend Bitcoin a few times already because it was easy money and I dont know the future of it.

Something that NFC might have going for it is that you can have two active NFC device talk and change dynamically than a static QR code. Its also two way unlike the QR code so maybe used for offline transactions. 
But I understand this card is a passive device so that will not be the goal. Just want to exhaust all possibilities. I don't have anything with NFC. I don't even have a smartphone. But I agree its weak when it comes to Bitcoin. I also don't like radio for things unless its ok for the info to leak.

People are getting caught up on the phone and QR code aspect of this. It does not have to be on the phone or use QR codes. It can just be a link that starts an app that logs you in. QR code a Phone was just a usability gimmick.
Everything else about this does for the most part to the end user the same as last past would. How secures you lock up your last pass is also up to the user like this would be.
How safe that will be is all up to how the software is set up that will use SQRL. Those things can be work out later. You could make a software that makes the user authenticate all the time, or only once and then it works for that day, etc the possibilitys are endless and not set in stone. 
The idea that sets SQRL form anything else is just that it does not use a 3ed party and you don't have to keep a growing database of logins. Is that something that will make it worth it? Who knows thats up to the user. Yes in the details it is vary different but the end results to the end user it not much.
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:23:07
Today really low, but that's not the point. This idea is when Bitcoin is something (if that ever happens). Today its a wast of time obviously.

All it does it confirms you put cash in it. It gives you a number and you go to a website to finish your transaction. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:14:00
It was sort of just a idea I had, people want to Bitcoin mine because its free money, this also helps secures a part of the network. It is also an active security system that is always running. And this takes power to run. I'm guess we don't really need all that power unless theirs an attack but there is really nothing I can think of that's built in to detect an attack and only use the power when needed, and I don't know if that would even be possible. 
But since mining is free money I guess people would not want to use less power anyway, and I'm sure it was made that way on purpose as an instinctive to run the network, turnings people greed as a tool to protect and run the network.
But I'm wondering if there is another way, maybe mining will always be a recourse battle but maybe securing the network a more passive system. So more separation between securing and getting the new funds. Maybe it only uses a lot of power when needed. 
So in end it will always take resources to run the Bitcoin system but is there a way to make it use less (because we are limited) but just as good, that's what I was thinking.

I'm fuzzy on how mining, and making new block work. How is the mining problem set up and propagated, like how is it decided what the next problem is going to be based on the difficulty? Is it possible to mine block ahead? What really is signing a transaction? And when I send a Bitcoin what really is a conformation? How do offline transaction work?

You get someone's Bitcoin address and in your Bitcoin client you will have a spot to put it plus how much to pay. Then you click send, when you send you unlock your funds with your private key (simply speaking) and broadcast it to the Bitcoin network. It jumps from node to node telling everyone about it.

The thing you need to keep in mind that the other calculator does do is estimated difficulty for mouths out based on past growth. If you look at  you can see that Bitcoin's networks hash rate is growing really fast. 
If Bitcoin stayed still than your calculator would be fine, but its getting much harder to mine Bitcoin every difficulty change. So I would be careful when getting into Bitcoin mining.

While I do think 3ed parties will indeed come into this space (like banks), but I also think that this will get more easy to do (as in keep your own coins safe) as time goes on (and Bitcoin becomes something). Purpose built devices can help this space also. Also people will gain a interests in their money and what they should do to keep it safe.


I don't know whats fact about this when we use words exact words such as as "many people". You can dress Bitcoin in paper and cards if someone really wanted to, I Bitcoin becomes something I think that that reason will not really be one for long. But I would agree its slowing adoption for some people.
I'm not interested in the rest, its mainly because I'm getting tired of the topic. But I do think its important people talk about it.

So you bought things with Bitcoins? Sounds more like you exchanged it first. You can do whatever you want with your money. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:23:22
I'm not sure. In a centralized system all I care about is if my money is valid under that centralized system. Not really that path it took to get to me. 
The blockchain is definitely part of validation of the system. I think this was picked as it works well for a peer to peer system. But even in Satoshi's paper he describes "pruning" process. So I don't feel it's all necessary.
In video games there are money systems that just use the trust in the system. The system is just people's balances growing and shirking. Something else I sort of though of in this context.

I'm not sure what this has to do with Bitcoin? Other than that it seems like a neat login system. I listen to Steve myself and I fine he is ok most of the time. 
Anyway if the subject is "will this make securing Bitcoins more easy" i'm not sure. This seemed more to do with authenticating yourself to a online service.

Maybe a rough alt coin maker who wants to be mean to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:03:25
I don't know what you mean, are you referring to what OP is doing?
@_date: 2013-10-14 20:56:34
I thought was was only to help anonymity.

I don't think there is a 2 way hash.

Trezor: a more convenient paper wallet.
(not a bad thing IMO)

Also from what I understand is the cocaine gets into the money counting machines and taints more bills not involved. Regards does not have too much to do with the topic.

Yeah there is nothing I can do about this. Which I think kinda sucks, well I could trow money at a ASIC and hope to get it one day but I'm not putting that on the line. I have a novelty Block Erupter and a 3 year old graphics card, but that cant do shit.

I would spend it if there where more things to spend it on.

Tell her its money, and selling things for money is a good idea. At least if you don't like this form of money you could exchange it for another that she would like.

I know you want to keep the barrier to entry low and want to speed up adoption buy making Bitcoins look like something people already know. 
But I feel as Bitcoins is being a new type of money from the old, that using Metric prefixes is not a something out of the question. This is a new start, and we already use these terms in many computer applications, and Bitcoin lives on computers; so the association seems logical.
The whole idea of the Metric system is to make all the systems look alike so people only have to lean one thing. I know it's just harder to lean something new when you are so use to the old thing. That's the problem Bitcoin is facing right now in the money world.
Many of are counting systems in history have been make to keep track of money.  for example. But we have changed before. 
I'm use to even working in decimals with Bitcoins, but whatever. IDK what system we end up using that much personally, but I also think suggesting new things is not a bad idea also.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:11:38
yeah

Well I only talked about those two things because that's what the subject was about. But yes I also think hardware wallets could work if they are cheap.

Maybe you (over)pay first and they give you the difference back. And the time you normally spend there could be used for confirmation. I will say that's not the best way but I guess if they really did not trust its customers they could do that. 
Or a hybrid system. You pay with Bitcoins but they also swipe your card. If you coins don't work they use the card.

fuck i never got allowance. sadness

I personally did not buy Bitcoins. I cant look at growth like that and take it seriously. But even if some people invested what they could afford they still don't want to loose it.

This is anecdotal and I have never used campBX before. I have used Coinbase and it worked fine and was easy for me at least.
