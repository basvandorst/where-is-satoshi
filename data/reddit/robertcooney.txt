Hey I am working through a solution to this process. It is in the testing phase right now, but works fine. Just a little manual work for me on the back end until I get it automated. If you want to try it with like $10, go for it. If not, then don't. I am not pushing it, just sharing my plan.
Take a look and let me know what you think. [ContinuumToken.com](

I have a similar process I am working on. Testing phase right now, but works fine. Just some manual work for me on the back end until I get it all automated. If interested, try with like $10. If not, then don't. I am not pushing it, just working out the process.
Anyway, give it a look and let me know what you think. [ContinuumToken.com](

I am working on a process to do exactly what you are asking. There are a few manual steps in the background that I need to do until I can get it automated. But I am just working through the process now.
Take a look and let me know what you think. The process works, but I am not promoting it until I get it all automated. Testing phase right now. If you want to try with like $10, go for it. If not, no worries.
