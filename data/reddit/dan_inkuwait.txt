Totally agree with your statement.  
But withholding information about foreign accounts from the IRS is a crime.  The penalties are severe.
There's a risk-reward scenario here and just make sure that you understand the risks.

How stable is any currency?
A few more countries leave EU and the euro will tank...  Saudi get pissed off enough with the US and decides to trade oil in anything but the USD and that will rocket down in value, too.

Years ago I did something similar with a colleague over a barrel of oil and a 100$ price point.... I lost 100$.
Good luck OP.

Forgive me I am noob.
Please explain to me how this is secure?  If I put my address info in a third party website, what's to stop the owner of the site from knocking my wallet open?

As a noob, sometimes it's hard to find unbiased information.  Sure theres YouTube videos, but for actually feedback from miners that staked their claim a decade ago?  That's why I seek answers here.

If you are considered a "US person for the sake of tax purposes*", then you pay income tax on your worldwide income. 
Regardless of the controller of the bitcoin, if it's in your possession (as a US person) then uncle Sam wants his cut.
Those 4th of July military parades ain't going to pay for themselves.

Regardless of "where" the account is, bit coin possession is considered an asset.   It's the only statement the IRS has issued on the subject.  
If  anyone really thinks capital gains on a bitcoin falls outside the IRS's definition of not being taxable remember this: when they couldn't get him for anything else, the government got Al Capone for tax evasion.
"As it stands, cryptocurrency is treated as property by the US government, meaning capital gains taxes apply to every transaction, whether it’s buying a $1m home or a $2 cup of coffee." 
"The sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences that could result in tax liability. This guidance applies to individuals and businesses that use virtual currencies."

I read this comment as "Thanks for sharing  this story about your computer teacher's stupidity.  It's a break from the regular shit posts here."
Did I interpret that correctly, or were you attempting to shit talk the OP?

I'll look it up, thank you!

Guess it all depends where you live.  I have colleagues whose houses  require compound walls topped with concertina wire and an armed guard 24hrs a day (west Africa/south America) and they still have had *serious* issues.
Bit coin scares me a little more because it's  digital and I'm an ignorant man in a literate world when it comes to technology: I can't see them coming for the coins.

I'm not an accountant.
But, when I've had losses from capital gains in the past, they were carried forward to the next year to cover future income.   Time for a meeting with an accountant.

Gotcha...  They call it gearing here.  And any financial planner will tell you it's a balls-on-the-chopping-block method of investment.  Best used for relatively stable investments like blue chip stocks that are also dividend kings to help cover the interest...

Explain to a noob, please?
I certainly understand the dangers of random links, but was just wondering what you specifically saw that raised a red flag for you?
