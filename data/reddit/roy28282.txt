Where I live the socialist polices raise the food prices,fuel prices,housing prices,electricity and water prices. But we have social safety network that is going bankrupt. Everything costs 2 to 3 times what it should. But the government cares about it's people enough to rob and steal from them.

I really like watches as well and enjoy collecting them. It conflicts with getting more Bitcoins. My grail watch is the Grand Seiko snowflake. I inquired about it few months ago at the local dealer. As I had money I haven't spent from work I figured I'll get more Bitcoin. It was near the bottom of this year. 
I get phone two weeks ago and went to see the watch because it arrived. It's beautiful and he suggested I'll get it with no interest 12 payments. I explained to him I'll lose the interest on the money.
I declined. I put the money into the monthly DCA. It's not worth selling the future for what is eventually superficial and temporary satisfaction.

The 2% inflation being good for economy is very debatable and more of a catchy phrase than a logical argument. Does it seem like the economy is working as intended with the planned inflation?
No central body can plan the inflation and it's constantly missed and results in higher inflation. Wages don't keep,money is stolen from people and transferred to those with already existing assets,there are boom and bust cycles that results in escalating financials crises every few years. Eventually it hits hyper inflation like in Venezuela.
Inflation is stealing money from the people who worked from it. It's an invisible tax. It's bad.

It's a paradigm shift to realize how fiat and Bitcoin work. Most people don't put in the time and effort to understand and only see Bitcoin as a risky investment.

Gold is not really well distributed either. Cash is losing it's value. If the Chinese pools decide to destroy their own source of income for whatever reason Bitcoin can be forked. Bitcoin is valuable because it is scarce and with a hard limit.
It can be split to 10^-8 or smaller unit. If Bitcoin is lost the rest becomes more valuable. Bitcoin can be quantum resistant when security upgrade will be necessary. 
Do you think the other fiat currencies will exist until 2140? 
There will be 21 million Bitcoins,if you check the addresses it's obvious that far less than 21 million will be rich as most of it is in the hands of hodlers,already rich people buying thousands of Bitcoin and financial institutions.
If that's your point of view don't buy Bitcoin. Just be aware it's a risk not doing so and take full responsibility for the outcome.

If Hamas would have not been focusing on terror and built schools,hospitals,hotels and factories Gaza would have been the best place to live in the middle east as Israel have no interests there and would rather do better things with it's resources and has no interest in war.
When Israel left USA bought the factories and greenhouses to give the Palestinians the ability to work and grow food. They were scraped for materials and sold the next day. 
Kill ratio means you don't value your peoples lives and send them to die in futile attacks and the other side cares about it's people lives. The number of people in Gaza has doubled with all the so called "genocide" going. Your kill ratio is better in Europe where it easy to run over helpless people with a truck or shooting teenagers in rock concerts. Hamas is your enemy and keep you more oppressed than Israel. Even if Israel would be gone tomorrow and you can kill,murder and rape all the Jews you would still live in a shithole and you will not have anyone but your great humanitarian and enlightened leaders to blame.
You can justify your ideology and focus on hating others for your situation or you can focus on making your life better.

You mentioned you won't buy washing machine because it will be cheaper tomorrow. People will buy at some point because they need to buy things at some point. Encouraging unnecessary spending can create inefficiencies and waste resources.

Concentration of power leads to corruption. No government should have the monopoly on money and the economy. Bitcoin is a line of defense against them as it's beyond their control and governments can't print or stop it.

Amazing meme.

Governments have the delusion it's possible to plan and control the economy through interests,money printing,taxes and laws and make it better. Governments stimulating and tampering down creates artificial inefficient economies that cause escalating financial problems.
It doesn't work. Governments are the cause of virtually all the problems.

When it's at 1 million it's time to HODL until 10 million.

After printing trillions what's printing another 250 billion to inflate the bubble some more and cause bit more inflation?

Don't bother. He will ignore every logical argument.

Hard to short Bitcoin with volume below 20 BTC on BAKKT.

Does he believe what is coming out of his mouth?
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:27:52
I thought all the weak hands were shaken out at 3k. Seems some more joined since. Seems people who buy Bitcoin are not really aware of the volatility until it hits them.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:48:08
That's good. It was getting boring around here.
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:18:52
If Bitcoin goes above this line it's going up,if Bitcoin will go below the lower line it's going down,if the price doesn't change it's going sideways. Add more words and terms no one knows about,film and you have TA channel.

If someone had quantum computing at this point capable of hacking into Bitcoin it would be incredibly stupid doing so as it would make everyone aware it exist and make him huge target for a very small profit. There are much bigger targets like nuclear launch codes.

That's a great meme.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:05:39
He is right. Will selling at 5x will change your life for the better significantly?
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:36:32
That's a funny meme. I like this one,it made laugh.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:11:21
Jinx it,I didn't buy enough. I am going to post the roller coaster meme to drop the price.

You just destroyed our bull run to the moon.
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:09:01
That's awesome. Really good meme.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:36:54
It's an opportunity to buy more at lower prices.
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:12:09
Drop it to 1,000 so we can all buy cheap please.
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:55:34
Do you trust her to never take all that Bitcoin if you break up? Because it's really easy.
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:06:23
It's fine. It means we can meme it when Bitcoin crosses 9000 again. Can't have too many DBZ memes.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:53:58
Good speech. People are too brainwashed sometimes to see how the current system screws them.
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:55:35
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:53:49
Because you are not looking on the price charts enough sending positive thoughts,visualizing Bitcoin mooning and chanting HODL,moon and lambo.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:37:44
All the TA people on YouTube say Bitcoin is going down to anywhere from 6000 to 3000 or even less. They all the previous charts and lines and circles. They must be correct.

The tax payer will pay for this and will get worse healthcare and education than he would have received otherwise. Do you think the government creates good,efficient and effective health system? 
It creates corruption and waste and monopoly over health.
The education system governments are designed to create drones and workers. Not independent,smart people who will be critical of their rulers. It also costs more and everyone have to pay their entire lives to fund it.

It also gives us more time to accumulate. Might as well take advantage of it.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:55:53
Always good to remember the basics of security.

Lets get to 9000 for the memes. Time for Vegeta to come out.

We should add central banks to Arya's list. They don't stand a chance against her.

He makes me want to buy Bitcoin. Can we keep him talking?
@_date: 2019-05-28 18:53:46
Seems like a highly advanced technical analysis. Need YouTube channel with more drawings and explanations.
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:15:55
Doesn't really seem like an issue. All the rest will be worth more and can be further divided into smaller units.

Went to sleep,Bitcoin went up. Going to sleep for 2-5 years now.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:42:00
Exit to what? To fiat? To something printed without any limits,with  inflation and requires other institutions permission to do transactions?
@_date: 2019-05-01 00:01:38
Memes are always good.
