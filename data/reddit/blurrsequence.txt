I had the identicle 05 solar yellow. although it was salvage titled. Loved that thing. Most fun I ever had in a car. Had to replace the motor due to overhead cam shaft shavings falling into the cylinder. It costed me like 5k and they threw in a supercharger. So cheap!

But isn't finding an exchange. Wire transferring money, buying bitcoin, making a wallet and then transferring it to that wallet already enough of a barrier for entry?
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:54:09
Wow, really? Are you that hostile towards someone who has only pointed out a very basic idea? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:08:43
Imagine your mom using the service. Then reality check her.

It could be used to add a third party to any digital transfer of information.
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:43:37
Sounds a lot more confusing than just run it on the main network, no?
Edit: I get that the technology will someday be useful. Just doesn't seem useful for someone wanting to buy a coke and not have to pay 2% fees to a credit card company. As a long time bitcoin user, I'd rather pay cash. So this doesn't make me all that hopeful for the system.

Not very knowledgeable on the subject. I've never attempted to use it.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:02:02
Well, you are obviously salty over nothing. I'm not talking about any coin other than the bitcoin. And all I said is that shit is confusing. And that I think the majority of users would rather just use bitcoin. I'd pay a 5$ fee over whatever you are talking about. Also, for a reality check, lightning network is not bitcoin. What shit coin are you shilling?

If you are purchasing a miner 180 days ROI is kind of what you aim for. This includes the sale of the miner. You need to be able to mine that much before it becomes unsustainable. Someone with cheaper electricity than you can purchase the miner at your reduced sale price and then ROI it in their own way. 
Mining is much too complicated to use calculators and guesswork to figure out when you will receive your ROI though. It's more of a gamble than a lot of miners will admit.

I read about this about a month ago and thought it also disappeared on reboot. It was from a guide on how to set it up specifically for a synology NAS. I also decided then and there to 'fuck that'. Would love to run one on my NAS but it's not worth it if that's the case. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 16:02:09
ROI of more than 180 days is horrible in btc minung. 3 years is infinitely bad. You don't know how it works.
Genesis mining is a scam. You can't even sell your stake. Not sure how profitable hashnest.com is, but you can at least sell everything if you don't like what you see.

I have done a lot of business with coinbase and recently they threatened to close my account unless I answered a lot of very specific questions about my finances and uses for bitcoin. I transferred everything I had left with them out.
@_date: 2017-01-24 15:29:27
Yes I meant to say i have 10% more bitcoin, if I sell my hash back. As is i have 10% of my principal sitting in my personal wallet while the 100% of my investment still hashes. I actually will only lose if btc price goes up a lot thus reducing my hashrate value (it's roughly tied to a static USD value) but should be the same usd value as i paid. But worth less btc. It's kind of confusing to explain. 
I cant comment on long term profitability. Although a year ago I bought 1 hashnest PACMIC v4 contract and it paid out a 5% btc return and I received my initial investment back. Took about a year to do it with the halving. So i do trust hashnest to some extent. Cloud mining may be a huge gamble though.
@_date: 2017-01-17 20:14:07
I switched because to buy through coinbase (not gdax) you pay a high fee plus they charge you like $15 more per bitcoin than the market rate. What is the deal with that?!
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:40:02
I'm up about 10% since december 12th 2016 at hashnest. If I sell my mining power. But im going to let it run. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:20:30
What the fuck. Did they bring it up because I asked?
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:44:26
Too bad you cant drink outside of it.

No. Just 12 feet on the lower edge. Rain does a pretty good job of cleaning them. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 04:30:14
Honestly they hardly ever have to be cleaned unless you have trees very close to the array. Mine are on a barn next to a 10 acre field and a dusty dirt road. They still produce the same wattage as the day they were installed 3 years ago.

Bitcoin will probably never be worthless. It's going to go up year after year. Just takes patience. People getting wallets hacked is not really that common. I'd assume if you keep your wallet on a PC that is trojaned and compromised you could get it hacked. But no one can just hack your wallet without you literally being dumb enough to give them everything they need to access it. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:31:39
Goddamn I hope it goes back to 1300! Those were the days. Nice. Peaceful. Happy days.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:48:01
I doubt this has any impact on price. The USD doesn't jump in value because of some small time bank robbery. Also I highly doubt much of any paid ransom coins ever get converted to fiat. Doing so would lead to an arrest. When those coins are exchanged for some type of good it will lead to physical evidence. I don't know how well Bitcoin mixers work or how safe they are and I doubt many are willing to find out if it might lead to jail time.

Imagine what that bilzerian dude lost
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:48:03
I'm betting 1600 will be the basic price until Chinese can cash out then maybe 1300 then. I'm holding forever since my average coin price is about 800.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:33:27
I bought some at 280 and my wife bitched and said I couldn't buy any more. Now she's like "why didn't you buy more anyway?"
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:44:03
Sell off always happens when it hits milestones it seems. I assume there will be a sell off when all of the Chinese are able to sell their coins they bought at 1000 or so and take a tidy profit driving it down at least 30% on Chinese exchanges. Also Chinese miners haven't had a paycheck since January. No one really talks about how many coins China has mined since January. I assume it's a lot.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:27:05
USD is more anonymous and untraceable than Bitcoin unless someone wrote down all of the serials first.
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:29:50
Oh and to keep them safe invest in a vault. It's a USB thing that makes it impossible for someone to access your wallet over the internet. You can just throw it in a safe too. Best way to store it long term. Never store it at an exchange because those have been hacked multiple times.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:35:48
Dan bilzerian. He's a gambling dude. He made an Instagram video stating that he bought a shit load of bitcoins shortly before the price reversed. He's bet 2.3 million USD on a coin flip so I can only imagine he put some serious cash into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:15:07
I went to gemini after using coinbase for a few years. Coinbase started to threaten closing my account down if I didn't give them my LinkedIn profile and proof of where my income was derived. Yup, they locked my account with some Bitcoin in it because I refused to give them a LinkedIn profile. Fuck those guys. Gemini has been a breeze compared. On an 8 BTC market sell or buy they charge about $25. When I transfer money I can instantly buy and sell Bitcoin until the ACH transfer completes. So your not stuck with 1600 Bitcoin while the price drops like a rock or whatever.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:32:54
Good point.
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:19:04
Don't know why people haven't mentioned hashnest.com. it's run by.... The only manufacturer of mining products (that I know of) you actually buy the miner and they host and power it. You are free to sell your hash power at any time. But it's still incredibly difficult to increase your Bitcoin stash there. It's possible, but you have to be extremely cunning or lucky.
