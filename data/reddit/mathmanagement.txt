Dollars are a very risky investment, if you hold them over long periods of time they go down in value significantly 100% of the time.
If you owned 1 billion dollars in 1965 they would have the purchasing power of 4.9 million dollars today because of the increase in supply of dollars that occured over that time period.
The supply of bitcoin cannot increase beyond 21 million, thus over long periods of time the value increases.
You may not realize, but by owning dollars you have already made an investment, which over time is 100% certain to lose value.

I'm not a fed fan but this is BS the total of these "secret loans" was 1.2 trillion not 16 trillion. The GAO who conducted the audit arrived at 16 trillion with the following math: 1 bank borrows 1 billion from the fed for 16 days= 16 billion total under GAO accounting. In reality it was only a 1 billion dollar loan.

It would instantly require all merchants/business in the US to accept bitcoin for payment for anything they sell, by law.

There were bank depositors who lost funds in 08, those who had excess of FDIC limits. I tracked all bank failures. Very few but the gov knows how to reign that stuff in. 
You seem to make a good straw man argument here.
It seems people like to confuse "talking your book" with "putting your money where your mouth is."

Why are precious metals dealers not required to register as MSB's in the US?
I can walk into a local coin shop with 20k cash and buy gold bars without any question.
Also, would I need to register as an MSB to sell individuals bitcoin through an in person transaction like on localbitcoin.com?

The hard part is getting btc in Venezuela. Thus mining is still profitable for citizens in VZ

Fees are unclear at this point as is pricing but there will be some clarity once those of us who applied are granted trading access. 
This is a big positive as it provides a forum for institutional money to enter the market directly. This type of investor is highly unlikely to step in a market through an entity that offers a high degree of counter party risk. Clients of institutional money managers are always concerned about counter party risk. Say a manager purchased btc through bitstamp or even coinbase if anything went wrong where damages were incurred investors don't hesitate to request compensation for damages via arbitration. While investors are usually made whole (assuming their manager or investment firm is a well capitalized large institution) the money manager and key decision makers, sometimes the chief risk manager could often lose their jobs as the result of the political consequences. Second Market is a registered broker/dealer subject to regulatory oversight by FINRA and the SEC, with an industry track record and solid capital base which provides institutional investors and money managers a reasonable level of counter party risk. Unfortunately, the users of the exchange will still need to find a solution or educate themselves on security issues around taking possession of btc. 
To clarify, Coinbase is NOT a broker/dealer (in terms of the legal entity) 
A broker/dealer is a legal entity engaged in the brokering and dealing of securities and bitcoin is not currently classified as a broker/dealer. I believe they have filed as an MSB with FinCen and likely filed with states but most states have not yet granted MTS licenses to bitcoin companies. 
The regulators are allowing them to continue operations as long as they cooperate and implement appropriate KYC and AML procedures, however this is a grey area and we should actually be thankful that regulators haven't forced the closure of such companies.
Second Market is a broker/dealer which is subject to state licensing in all states they do business. Since they are required to obide by very strict regulatory procedures and oversight including KYC and AML one could infer that would allow them to operate a national btc exchange without MTS and MSB licensing. A more interesting question is, "Is it easier to be a compliant bitcoin exchange by forming a broker/dealer as opposed to an MSB?" I'm sure the legal teams at the well funded btc exchange start ups are exploring this already. I am not a lawyer and am making some assumptions so take it for what you will.
Regarding Second Markets service as an exchange, it does say in the language that if you wish to trade you will work with a trader, but it's not yet clear what that really means. Most exchanges prior to the internet, worked in a similar fashion so that structure does not mean it isn't an exchange. If they do use this structure initially they will likely offer a comprehensive web based in exchange in the future as they seem to be all in on bitcoin and that would only make sense. By launching this way it would allow them to get in the market now and begin building some depth to the order book. Most of us have seen exchanges that start with a web based platform immediately and don't have much depth to their order book. 
Sorry for the lengthy reply, I hate reading long responses in threads, so I don't blame anyone for being annoyed.

It's also inaccurate because they are using non-weighted averages. If one transaction in a block was 1million dollars the associated miner fee would be much larger in dollars than a 5 cent transaction but the fee as a percentage would still be much smaller than a fiat transfer. Their math counts the two transactions equally by adding them together without weighting their respective fee to its transactions size relative to the the total in the block. So whoever is saying this stuff is really bad at math.

Ahh yes this customer sounds familiar. She is my wife, my mother, my sister and my friend. Guess what they all have in common? Me. And I fucking love bitcoin and that's what they know about it. Because of me they each have bitcoin wallets downloaded on their iPhones with five dollars of bitcoin in them because I sent it there. Does my wife understand the blockchain? Fuck no. Will she one day? Never. But if Walmart, the store she shops at accepted bitcoin she will be paying for things with it. Why? Because she's married to me and I told her it was better. Is she tech savvy? Nope. But she's a fucking expert at Facebook and Instagram. Why? Was she an early adopter that marveled at the code and user experience that mark zuckerwhatever created? No. Her fucking girlfriend told her it was cool and she should do it too. It's that simple. And who told her girlfriend it was cool? Her husband. He was an analyst at a vc company that was investing in social media. My point is We are all tied together more closely than we realize so I would say your argument is incredibly short sighted and almost ironic coming from the largest retailer in the world.
