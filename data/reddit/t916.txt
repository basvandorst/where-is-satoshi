Why is this shit bot in this subreddit?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:05:22
Did DJ Khaled give you a little help?

Can we upvote this thread to make it the Crash Discussion thread to the front page? Or have a separate one to discuss the crash?
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:07:48
Nah, there's no way an intern would be allowed to post something like this without approval from higher ups.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:44:53
This will go back up right? I bought in at $512 and now I'm having anus quivers
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:20:55
Thank you so much, this eases the stress a lot haha
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:42:08
So, is market manipulation the only reason it's dropping right now? I'm holding, but I bought at $512 a month ago and now I'm getting worried.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:14:24
Because I'm a new buyer and still don't have a total grasp on how CoinBase works
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:56:48
Wooh thanks! Also what degree would you need to get in that field? You got me thinking of the bigger picture aha

That pizza looks delicious. Do you deliver to California?
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:20:18
How about you just give me that drive? :)

I hope you mean that you're going to be holding out for so long, that you'll die before you get to spend it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:51:27
So if I bought 1 bitcoin last night, but it hasn't arrived yet, does that mean I'm going to get the bitcoin at yesterday's $508 price? Or Fridays $1000 price?

Do you also tell them "Insert here for a piece of dat ass!"
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:41:29
Won't it go back up after crashing? Or will it never go back above $500?
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:50:22
HOLY SHIT 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:35:13
I've heard a lot of people on this sub say that bitcoin will stabilize at or near $10,000. What is their basis for coming up with that number, and is their any way to predict where it will eventually stabilize?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:46:22
Oh yeah of course, I'm holding out for at least a few months, probably at few years. I just want to make sure I'm not losing my initial investment.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:36:07
After this crash, will the prices keep rising? I have no intentions of pulling out now after buying in at $512
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:33:53
Would it be smart to wait until this wave of buyers has passed and then buy as the price settles down?
