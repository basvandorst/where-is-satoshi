id pick herpies as the last reason. its the only place in the universe we know of that has herpies. probably Open Water would be the second last reason, what a horrible movie.

we have one highway that is about to turn into two separate highways on the 1st of aug and they cannot see eachother to stay parallel, but hopefully they merge together again or stay parallel and everyone will follow certain rules because one highway might fuck the other. so the person who needs a eli5 about this may need to do very little if people accept this new rule. that about right?
