Mcaffee will eat his dick if BTC does not* hit $500k.... hard to say a bear dream, maybe it will hit $499k, maybe less, all we know now is that Mcaffee will eat his own dick.

Should have thought harder about wearing that red shirt

I am agreeing with you

Oh yes, currencies "like Bitcoin," AKA alt coins, ICO's.

Not going to happen until people start using btc instead of fiat

People believe it will make them rich and buy to make a profit not to participate in a crypto economy. Bubble popping will help the crypto economy by thinning out speculation.

On TV he said "BTC will hit $40k EOY 2018," next day at crypto talk, "BTC will be biggest bubble of our lifetime..." How does Novogratz think the price action will play out?

Still in bull market, my guess is we dip around 14k. 10K is landmark price that will bring tons of positive press -- financial pundits questioning whether there is a ceiling or not and citing 40k EOY targets = more speculators, increase cap. CME futures another big pump and it could bring on shorts. After this we enter run zone. Liquidity is not high enough to handle big dumps. Fiat is still key and if whales cash out we face huge run potential. Saving grace would be if big box retailers like Amazon start accepting BTC--this would allow masses to start using BTC as a currency--would change the game. Bottom line is that crypto needs to become a usable currency, until then we are all just speculators who believe in a product that has yet to realize its true use value.

He owns BTC to diversify--not "all in," so to speak. It's an important distinction. Since we are still years/decades(?) from using crypto instead of fiat currency, these smart people will make an easy buck running BTC in cycles then buying back in at a lower price.  Easy buck at the expense of the commons. After all, we are dealing with an unregulated market.
