I think an online wallet, like blockchain.info, eliminates the problem, because the pubic key for my entire wallet isn't exposed on the blockchain.  Let me know if I got this wrong.  Thanks!

Is there any way to transfer bitcoin without exposing the public key on the blockchain?

Do we have to list each trade when we file?

Thanks for the answer!  I feel so much better now.  Do I have to list each trade, or can I summarize?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:53:47
That's what I want to do too

Yes, up to $3000 per year.  If you lost more than $3000 then you can continue to deduct those loses up to $3000 per year.

I traded heavily in December.  In the end I did well, but I also lost a lot of money when bitcoin dipped.  How is it possible that I could be charged tax when the price was going up, but I can't deduct when the price is going down?  That is not logical.  I hope that I misunderstand the rules, because as it stands now I'm losing more than 60% of my profits to taxes.  I have no problem paying reasonable taxes, but this is just crazy.  Is there any way I can just pay taxes on my net profits at the end of December?

AH!  Thank you so much for that information.  That makes perfect sense.  You made my day.

What about the losses?  We pay taxes on the gains but can't count the losses?  That's insane.  It isn't reasonable.

I used bitcoin.tax which totally screwed up the calculations.  And I paid for that crap.

Could you add the Sept. 2017 China ban?  That's the only other crash that started higher than the other crashes in terms of beginning bitcoin price.

Yeah I understand now.  This is fantastic news.  I almost paid thousands extra if I had only used bitcoin.tax as a guide.
