I’m not entirely convinced that cryptocurrency swaps qualified for 1031 treatment anyways.  Notwithstanding, they certainly do not now.

It depends.  By buying/selling something you are exchanging for value, in kind or for money.  In this case, it would be in kind.  If you bought 1 BTC for $5.00 (I know this is not the current exchange rate, but follow me here), you have a basis of $5.00.  So, when you sell or exchange, anything you receive in exchange in money or in-kind value (money, property, services), you will recognize the difference between fair market value of what you receives less basis.
So in the example above:
1 BTC (that you bought for $5.00)
Exchanged for:
1 coffee ($5.00) - no gain or loss
1 coffee ($7.00) - $2.00 capital gain
1 coffee ($4.00) - $1.00 capital loss
$10.00 in services - $5.00 capital gain
$6,000 in cash - $5,995 in capital gains (bravo) and some sincere questions on why you are selling your damn BTC.
As a note, you may want to keep track of your BTC to separate long and short term gains and losses.  Different wallets?
Hope this helps.
