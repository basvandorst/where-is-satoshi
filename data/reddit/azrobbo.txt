There a small startup by some guys from the bitcoin talk forums , and I've done approx. 30 transactions through them. 
The entry looks right so far, but you'd also need to make the other adjustments I put in the post. 
Let me know if you have other questions.

By "withdrawal funds" are you referring to getting fiat back after selling BTC, or getting your BTC after buying it with fiat?
They are primarily a BTC buying site, for people who who wang to buy BTC with a credit card and get it relatively quickly.  They do have a test option to sell BTC once you've attained one of the higher membership levels.  (Membership level are based on number and size of transactions. )
Their BTC selling system currently asks you specify a URL to something you'd like to purchase (ex: a link to an Amazon gift card) and they'd send that to you when your BTC sell.  I haven't used this feature myself, so I don't know much more than that. 
As far as getting BTC when purchasing with fiat, you can either have them placed in a private key (which you can later swipe into your wallet), or a new option to transfer them to any address of your choosing.

BTCQuick - they allow you to buy with credit cards. 
But, since they only allow buying with credit cards, you'd need to make a few additions to some of the answers in the drop-downs. 
Specifically, you'd need to add a "not applicable" choice for the bank selection, and a "credit card" choice for the payment selection.
