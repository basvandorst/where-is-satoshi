You think people won't use Bitcoin if it costs $1.00 to send a transaction amirite?
Two points:
1. Unless you're counting on 10GB blocks before you're 97 years old and withering away into dust, we're GOING to push up against the block limit, be it 1MB, 20MB or 200MB. Bitcoin NEEDS these general improvements, these are NOT OPTIONAL. Fee markets WILL develop in any universe where Bitcoin is a resounding success.
2. Would you say this to a Greek: "Hey, there's this fixed supply monetary system called Bitcoin. It's outside the control of central banks, so it has no capital controls. You can move your money outside the system - here, let me show you how.
"Thanks god man- I can't pull my cash out, this system is going belly up, I'll lose everything!"
"But I should mention, Bitcoin costs a $1.00 to send"
"Oh, nvm, would rather **LOSE ALL MY MONEY GUARANTEED**"
Said no Greek person ever.
When's the last time you even *spent* Bitcoin anyway, and couldn't you have done that on LN or Coinbase etc etc?
Don't you see, in any meaningful success scenario, high value BTC transactions will push out low value BTC transactions. We will be in the SAME situation. You are essentially advocating to put lipstick on a pig, but worse than that you're taking the pig to slaughter! You'd rather kill off more full nodes, further eroding the fundamental and unique values of Bitcoin just to dress up that pig TEMPORARILY.

8GB blocks mean the chain grows by 48GB per hour
That's 1TB per day. **365TB per year**.
This is NOT an acceptable risk!
If you think it's possible for a *medium sized firm* let alone an individual to handle that in absence of Moore's Law or Nielsen's Law holding, you're *simply mistaken*. The very fact that Gavin and Mike are willing to risk Bitcoin's decentralization on speculative leaps in technology, is UNACCEPTABLE.
They're saying, no matter what happens, if the chain is growing at 365TB per year, too bad! If network connectivity isn't good enough by then, ISPs own Bitcoin. Whoops! Who could've seen THAT one coming, amirite? It's ok though, we'll be rich! What's not to like? Everyone knows you can trust the government now!

How many of you replying to this think a competing altcoin can dethrone Bitcoin? All of you are wrong.
*Dogecoin* is almost *free* to use compared to Bitcoin. How on earth is that going to dethrone Bitcoin? A fee savings of $1.00 per transaction will be enough to do what for DOGE? Describe how the altcoin with cheaper fees, which currently is ALL of them, will finish off Bitcoin based on that alone. Kicking BTC while it's "down". After all, with Bitcoin's sustained "high" fees of $1.00, no one could possibly be using it!

And you would say what, exactly, to the hundreds of millions of Americans on the internet being illegally surveilled by the NSA? Because if they protested, things would be different? Do you believe the LAW *matters*?
@_date: 2015-06-19 07:42:19
Describe what is this better altcoin, and how does it get picked up by the market. Currency is simple: network effect, liquidity, security. That's it! That's all you need to dethrone Bitcoin. Tell me how it happens. Again, your view that Bitcoin can be replaced by a competing currency standard has been debunked hundreds of times over the years. You're just simply mistaken. Bitcoin is not Myspace, or Google!
Secondly, you must've missed OP:


We don't even need Lightning or Sidechains, higher fees work too. You can still use the main chain! Just pay a $1.00. Is it really so bad?
Moore's Law does NOT apply to bandwidth, which grows more slowly than disk storage by an order of magnitude.


Now you've introduced a second speculative narrative: that Bitcoin will have growing pains in the next 1-3 years. I like your optimism, but I'm not convinced Bitcoin is going to keep growing on an exponential curve. I am fairly convinced that 1MB blocks are a strain on full nodes, which is the network's last resort against government introduced blockchain policy threats. Just because they haven't tried in 2015, doesn't mean they won't try in 2025, after Bitcoin is broadly adopted with the only nodes being controlled by datacenters and big companies.

Hey, armchair marketing exec!
If you don't think Bitcoin is worth it, **WHY ARE YOU HERE**?!
Are you here because of LOW FEES?
NO! You're not! You're *really* not. OMG this is getting so pathetic.
Do ya *think* it could be more important for a currency to have massive liquidity and network effect rather than low fees?
If not, shouldn't you be flocking to Dogecoin like a complete tool?
They even did nascar, which as an armchair marketing exec I'm sure you feel cements Dogecoin's blissful future of super sexy low fees.
Gee, I wonder if you're completely wrong! Thanks marketing exec, for your continued precious, valuable insights. We'd all be rich if we'd only listen to YOUR INANE IVORY TOWER OPINIONS.

Yeah what do 80% of core developers know, anyway?! What does Adam Back know, anyway?! He only invented HashCash, pshh what a crock of bs amirite? That's surely nothing compared to the many accomplishments of on Reddit who thinks block size should be increased. Let's not listen to the experts who *built* 95% of Bitcoin's core consensus layer over the last 5 years BY HAND. They don't know diddly and can't be trusted to debate for ... reasons!
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:23:36
Mostly agree. But a cataclysm in global financial markets will send people looking for alternative currencies, and they will find cryptocurrencies appealing regardless of whether or not the leading cryptocurrency has a 1MB block size limit due to current hardware and network connectivity constraints.
For this not to hold true, there would have to be an altcoin today that you could point out has massive liquidity, perfect security and Bitcoin-like network effect. It simply does not exist today, and it will not exist tomorrow or the next day etc.
In the end Bitcoin still wins on network effect alone even if it costs $1.00, or even $100, to send a transaction.
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:09:26
It's not just storage you need 365TB more per year of, it's the bandwidth to service it, which is EVEN WORSE. If tech doesn't catch up, but the demand is there, we are PERMANENTLY TRAPPED in a Bitcoin that is owned by ISPs. Does the truth hurt?
@_date: 2015-06-19 04:54:13
You must not understand how blockchains work, and hence why Bitcoin is impossible to dethrone.
1. Liquidity
2. Network effects
3. Security
Because Bitcoin was first, and because it has the most adoption, it also has the most liquidity and security and hence the most USEFULNESS as a currency. How will any altcoin unseat that? So what if it costs $1.00 to send a transaction on the main chain? Most people NEVER SPEND their savings, and COLD STORAGE describes 80+% of current BTC holdings.


And when the Grexit happens, and the EU is in pandemonium spiraling out of control, how useful is your cash in a German bank? Don't you see why Bitcoin is inevitable regardless of the first world problems its users have?! One measely dollar for a transaction ON THE MAIN CHAIN. There are side chains. There is Lightning. There is Coinbase. Etc Etc.


Congratulations! Tell him what he's won! Do you realize you're the 10,000,000th person to suggest an altcoin will overtake Bitcoin? Look, currency isn't this hard. It's about network effect, it's about security and liquidity PERIOD. Bitcoin was first, it has the best of them all, and it's a positive reinforcement loop from here, regardless of whatever Mike Hearn or Gavin says.
But go ahead: be the millionth Bitcoin critic to describe its downfall from an alternative system. We are locked in, that ship has sailed.
Blockchains fundamentally converge towards high value usage, doesn't matter what you cook up in your head, this always happens. As I've previously explained, block size IS LIMITED. BY PHYSICS. Block space isn't infinite even at 200MB which is impossible for the network to handle until ten *years* from now **at best**. That *still* only results in less than 1000 tps, FAR less than you need the entire world to use BTC
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:26:29
You can't be serious. Horrible first world *internet problems*? The HORRORS!
Nielsen's Law is even *more* speculative than Moore's Law; bandwidth arguably isn't even growing at 50% per annum, it's more like 15% per annum if we were measuring conservatively (which we're not, this is Bitcoin we're talking about, no room for conservatism).
Let's be clear, this is a HUGE leap of faith. 8GB blocks without BOTH Moore's Law and Nielsen's Law meeting and *exceeding* expectations would UNQUESTIONABLY limit full nodes to running at ISPs.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:13:32
Unless you think the block size limit will be 10GB before you're 208 years old and ossifying in your grave, blocks will be full in every global adoption scenario you're envisioning.
Full blocks, as in, not all transactions can make it on the chain BY DEFINITION.
You can ignore this, but that would be sticking your head in the sand.
If blocks are full, higher value transactions will force out lower value transactions. It's Econ 101!


What's the last thing you even BOUGHT with Bitcoin?! My god, seeing how concerned you are about on-chain payments, you must buy bed sheets on Overstock like mad!
It's called:
- cold storage
- of
- a fixed supply
- uninflatable by political whim
- unseizable
- STORE OF VALUE
That is the  use case of Bitcoin today, and probably will be true for at least the next 30 years.
Bitcoin is a "payment system" LAST, not first.
And the BTC you spend? Would be worth nothing at all without trustlessness and decentralization.
A Bitcoin network where at least in theory all participants COULD run full nodes is infinitely more trustless than one where the only full nodes are at ISPs.
It's possible to have full nodes in every household in 30 years, or a full node per ISP. I'm sure you'd agree the former model is more likely to represent a frictionless and trustless form of money.
Couldn't you trust small amounts of BTC to multisig and then proxy it on a sidechain or on lightning, or God forbid, Coinbase?
All of the above is unavoidable with full blocks. Your cheap transactions WILL be forced out! This isn't a theory. Make your decision, because it's flat out impossible for all transactions to stay on-chain. Stop sticking your head in the sand!

Martin Gilens of Princeton University and Benjamin Page of Northwestern University have conclusively proved special interest groups and corporate elites [dominate national policy](






Your optimism seems rather misplaced to me. The public's influence in matters of a nation's self-interest are statistically proven to be long, long odds. Surely a national interest describes money beyond any shadow of a doubt.
And do you *really* they'll fail to enforce controls on cash, like they're *already doing* in [France](
