Hilarious read OP, doing Satoshi’s anti-scam work

Example of rephrasing in a negative light right here.
No he didn’t have to ask for permission, he had to notify his bank he would be buying bitcoin, bank could have anti-fraud software to prevent your account from being drained.

Happy cake day

Didn’t know that, thanks!

New to btc, could someone explain what this is talking about
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:26:31
Kinda what I planned, thanks!

Is there a significant price vs functionality between the nano x and s
Edit: From a btc beginner view

Epic bruh moment

Just another layer of security I guess, better safe then sorry. Like telling your bank you’re going to be using your debit or credit card in a different state or country for trips.

I bought at 13k, and then sold at 11k because I like to lose money, that’s how much I don’t give a fuck. /s
@_date: 2019-07-04 10:50:07
Okay thanks for the explanation ����
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:37:42
Indeed, I keep my minimum, buy every so often, and then try to trade up for more because I enjoy it
@_date: 2019-11-14 11:55:14
That’s a keeper for sure

Feeling pretty comfortable as I sold some to cover my initial investment plus a little more, but kinda mad that it could’ve been more as it keeps going up. Still making profit, but I’ll guess I’ll have to be happy with cutting my risk

Would it hurt more for it explode from 10.5 up while waiting for 10k dip, or it going to 10k after you bought at 10.5
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:22:30
Ikr, I like the vapor wave vibe
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:55:17
Thanks for the scoop, have an updoot
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:47:53
Makes sense, thanks for the clarification
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:52:09
Hmmmm indeed

Quick question, what’s the difference between the two subs r/btc as opposed to here, r/bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:26:23
I bought in at 6100ish and panic sold when it started dropping down to around 7200 ish, and then it started going up again. Big oof, but definitely learned my lesson.
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:05:42
No reason for you to be downvoted for a question, like honestly
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:17:30
Wish I could’ve done that but seeing as I was like 9 when btc first started
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:41:22
Good comparison, never thought about this
