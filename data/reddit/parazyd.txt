This is me. Two years ago I had pancreas cancer. I've managed to cure it with the positive help of my friends. And with the help of faith. After I was cured, I totally switched around and started living a healthy life. Now I'm working out a lot and the cancer has almost gone away completely. The regular checks cost a bit, and maybe the reward could help me deal with it more easily. Thank you for reading.
