I don't like the guy either but those "explosives" were illegal fireworks and as far as I know it's no more dangerous to transport illegal fireworks than it is to transport legal fireworks. You're all acting like he's a fucking mass murderer psychopath while all he did was ship fireworks through the mail.

[Ethereum]( is currently handling nearly 4x the daily transactions of [bitcoin]( with much faster confirmation times and fees under a dollar. And that's without POS and without blockchain sharding which should be implemented this year. It seems to be doing just fine, although the fees are crazy high right now with average ETH fee being $0.40 from the usual &lt;1 cent fee.

Majority of transactions people make with BTC is one or two at a time, usually sending from an exchange and back to the exchange or sending to a friend. Almost nobody does 3+ transactions with the same person on the same address. Lightning network will not really solve anything for the average user. Segwit will reduce fees but only by half max. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:47:28
They are all running on blockchain, they don't need to pass the test of time for 10 years for us to know they are secure. A coin's network is secure as long as it has a large enough number of miners/stakers. 
I really hate the "decentralization" point for bitcoin. How exactly is bitcoin more decentralized than say ethereum which has 3x the nodes bitcoin has and can only be mined with a GPU (no ASICs), so there are no massive chinese mining farms that take 90% of the hashrate?

When is it going to solve it? In 50 years? I remember reading over 2 years ago how "bitcoin will implement smart contracts within 6 months" and we're 2 years later and it's still nowhere to be seen. It's the same with everything. Altcoins are progressing at fast speed while btc will maybe catch up in couple years. And that's a big maybe.

Is that even a question that has to be asked?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:34:29
Yes, but you first need to estabilish a lightning channel with them. Opening it is 1 bitcoin transaction and then withdrawing funds and closing it is another bitcoin transaction. If you're just making one transaction then doing it through lightning will be 2x as expensive as a regular BTC transaction.

Ethereum for the past few days has 600,000+ transactions per day. Bitcoin has 400,000 and it struggles with 40k unconfirmed transactions right now and high fees, while with ethereum you can transact for fractions of a cent and have your transactions confirmed within minutes or even seconds. Now Ethereum is not a currency but it's likely that stable currencies will be built on top of ethereum.
With bitcoin we have no idea when the lightning network is coming. It's likely months away and even that will be an off-chain solution, which isn't very secure.
IOTA also has a lot of transactions daily and the promise of IOTA is essentially extremely fast transactions for zero fees. Right now it's centralized due to the coordinator but if (when?) it gets removed, it could become a serious bitcoin competitor, even surpassing it since you can't really compete with zero fees.

I don't see why people have such problems with altcoins here. I made some pretty money from altcoins. You just invest some bitcoins, wait for price to go little bit up and dump it and let the coin die. And you move to another one. Easy profit. Sure, sometimes the price will only go down and you'll lose but mostly you profit.

Now I actually noticed that 20% off of $17.99 is $14.39 which is not enough for free shipping so you force people to buy more or not use the discount in the product page.

@_date: 2014-09-16 04:43:04
The reason why I don't do any giveaways is simple because I havy really low amount of bitcoins. I was planning to buy some, but I wasn't happy with the fact that for my $196 I wouldn't get even one bitcoin. With dogecoin is it different, I have about 18,000 Dogecoins so I can afford to tip people with it. However I tip mainly on twitter and twitch and not on reddit. If I see good post here on I just can't tip it with dogecoins because this is mainly bitcoin subreddit and most people wouldn't even care about it anyway and on there are mainly post that are not as good to be tipped but if I see one I will be happy to give a tip.

I was thinking a lot about finding a job but it's not easy when I have school and I really don't feel like I want to lose that minimum free time that I have. I was starting with 0.1 BTC and I got to 0.3 BTC in less than 4 months just by investing into other cryptos, mostly those that were distributed as an ICO. Sometimes I lose money but mostly I earn. So I don't really think I need the job to get more bitcoin as long as there are altcoins to invest into but I'm looking for ways how to earn some money on the internet.

Probably when I discovered humble bundle in July 2013 but I'm sure I have heard about bitcoin before. In late 2013 I have decided to try to mine some bitcoins with my computer but I only mined about 3000 satoshi in a hour so I stopped. And then at beggining of 2014 I decided that bitcoin is really cool so I was trying to get some for free since then. I managed to get only 0.21BTC until today mainly because of investment in altcoins, but I'm sure I'm gonna get more.
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:35:40
Not really, people that are new to bitcoin might fall for it and think that someone has tipped them a big amount of money and later they'll find out that it was a fake tip and they'll drown in disappointment.

It's a risk like everything else, but bitcoin is something revolutionary, something that people will want to use when they'll stop thinking that people use it to buy drug/it's a ponzi scheme. And I believe that price will go up in the next months or years.

I use Coinbase only because they have insurance *(and they're integrated in most of the websites like Humble Bundle so I can pay with 1 click)*. It is cost for anonymity and I can take it, but lots of people wants to stay anonymous so I'm happy to see their support be nice and not lie.

Bitcoin get value from people that have agreed that bitcoin is worth something. If one person say that bitcoin is worth $10 then he can't change the price but if thousands of people will agree that bitcoin is worth $10 and they'll start selling it at $10, then bitcoin will be worth $10 soon. But nobody would ever sell so much under market value and that's reason why bitcoin price is relatively "stable". So pretty much everyone that "own" some bitcoins give bitcoin value.

I occasionally buy something with bitcoin but I take it mainly as an investment and I'm not professional trader. I'm 14 years old boy who has shitty grades in school so my future job will probably be the worst shit. So I'm investing into bitcoin, hoping it'll takes up enough to earn me money to at least buy a flat and live my life on kinda decent level. So I have basically 5 years for me to gather enough Btc (have 0.33 so far) and for bitcoin price to get at least to 10k/BTC
And I'm sure lots of other people see bitcoin as a gateway to a better world that will help them from their debts or even make them millionaires.
So I do agree with using bitcoin but I think that best would be to tell people to have few bitcoins as an investment and the rest use for buying stuff.

Reason I take bitcoin as an investment is because I want to go to space. And considering that there are already companies offering flights to space for $200,000 it's not that impossible. I just need bitcoin to succeed.

**Hi Victoria! I have few suggestions for changetip:**
**-** Last week there were lots of fake tippers that were tipping people with huge amounts of bitcoin and marked their tip as private. But they apparently didn't had any bitcoins.
And also, people are really upset about the bot spam, so maybe **the private function should be primary**, but only if a person doesn't have enough bitcoins on his CHT account, then a bot would reply with message about lack of bitcoins on his account. It would reduce spam by bot and it would also place those fake tippers out of game. Win win!
**-** Recently, there are also lots of people tipping only one satoshi. I don't have anything about people tipping others of course, but 1 satoshi is nothing and it always will be nothing. So I think there should be minimum tip amount. I would set it to **1 bit (100 satoshi)** to reduce spam to minimum.
**-** Third thing, not so necessary are **statistics**. It would be awesome to know how much in total was tipped, who is the best tipper, who tips most often etc...
**^^And ^^thank ^^you ^^for ^^your ^^awesome ^^work ^^with ^^changetip!**

Please no. There is a difference between spamming a company and requesting for something to be added. By sending spams to valve like "add bitcoin pls" which would be exactly what most people would be writing them, you would make it even worse and they would be thinking that bitcoin community is made up from unimportant people that would have no positive gain for them.
Let's just wait a little bit more, they will have to add it sooner or later, so don't just make it worse by spamming them. If you want to send a letter as an individual tho, you can write to Gabe Newell, there is his email somewhere and he is known for responding to most, if not all emails he gets.

I think that private function should be removed from changetip as not many real tippers use it and it's mostly used by fake tippers.
OR the private function should stay same but if person doesn't have enough bitcoins on his changetip account, then the bot should make a reply to his comment that the tip could not be delivered because he doesn't have enough bitcoins.

I mean I agree but decentralization basically means trustless security. I just fear that most people really don't care about that. Out of the already small amount of people holding bitcoin, how many of them are holding it on a centralized exchange or centralized wallet like Coinbase, Binance etc? Probably a lot, even I am guilty of it holding a portion of my BTC on exchanges for trading purposes.
I feel like it is really unfair to compare MtGox to these kinds of stablecoins, because one was an exchange directly holding people's bitcoins that when they lost it, they couldn't do anything. This stablecoin is pretty centralized, and if somebody hacks them and steals all the USDCs, they can simply freeze them. Even if they couldn't, they would just refuse to exchange those stablecoins into dollars, and nothing would happen. Due to the centralization of USDC here, it's pretty much impossible for anything like MtGox to happen, unless they also hack Coinbase's bank account.
 
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:43:58


Do you hold bitcoin because you believe in the technology and want a trustless payment system not reliant on banks or because "BRO MOON, LAMBOS OMG GONNA GET RICH"? Because if the latter (and if majority of people have that same mindset), then bitcoin is just a decentralized ponzi scheme to you and there would be no reason why it shouldn't go to zero.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:33:08
Even if we had 32MB blocks, which would be extreme (even Bitcoin Cash has only 8MB) and assume that every block for the next 10 years will be completely full, the blockchain would only grow to 16.8 TB. That is 17 TB in 10 years.
Currently a 10 TB hard drive costs under $400. In 10 years you will probably be able to get a 50 TB drive for the same price. You could argue that with such size of the blockchain, very little people could actually run local wallets and nodes, but that's already the case. Majority of bitcoin users use online wallets or wallets like Electrum that don't require you to download the blockchain.
In conclusion, increasing the block size is the only reasonable choice, otherwise the fees will stay like they are right now, and perhaps even go up at which point the chance for bitcoin adoption is zero.
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:11:14
How long does it take to sell BTC into real us/euro? Sometimes weeks. If you're a trader that's ridiculous. How long will it take to sell BTC into USDC? It will be instant. Perfect for trading, sending stable money to other people, payments, surviving a price crash, etc.
I think that bitcoin is slowly losing all of its advantages. Not that I'm a FUDder or anything or that I want to see bitcoin fail, but you look at all these stablecoins launching (Gemini recently launched their own that is a legitimate one) and they basically have all of the advantages that bitcoin has, plus they are actually stable so they are usable as a currency and for payments. Their only disadvantage to BTC is that they're not decentralized, at least not the exchange system. But how many normal people/businesses actually care about that? Not to mention to sell, buy or pay with BTC you basically have to do it through a centralized service.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:38:54
Yeah, sure. People are paying $5 in fees today and not getting their transactions confirmed after several hours, even days. But totally a 33 cent fee will confirm under an hour.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:03:22
That's why I said that such case would be extreme. The point was that increasing the block size to 2MB (and perhaps even 4 or 8MB) has nearly zero downsides, yet the core developers are trying to avoid block size increase like the plague.
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:28:23
My point in the beginning was that most people, even those in bitcoin don't really care about decentralization seen by the massive amount of BTC stored on exchanges and online wallets. You then said that bitcoin has many advantages against stable coins. If decentralization isn't one of them, then surely the fluctuating price must be the one. And I asked the question what advantage does a fluctuating price has over stable price.

Wow, finally. You can't believe how long I waited for somebody to ask me a question about oracles in regards to smart contracts.
Let me introduce you to ChainLink, which is a decentralized oracle network. It's still [WIP]( currently it's in alpha but it's set to release on main net by end of the year. Supports Ethereum, Bitcoin and Hyperledger and can support basically infinite amount of smart contract platforms. If you want to read the whitepaper, you can read it [here]( So no, soon decentralized smart contracts will be able to use decentralized oracles too.
Ok, shilling over. I don't understand how you can possibly think that smart contracts are snake oil? Do you even know the possibilities of what they can allow? Literally fucking everything. Decentralized exchanges (no more Mt.Gox), decentralized betting, decentralized tracking, decentralized and secure voting systems, decentralized identity and lending systems, decentralized and faster trading of stocks, derivates and futures, decentralized logistics tracking and much, much more. All are now possible thanks to smart contracts.
Edit: almost forgot about DAOs, companies that will be able to run themselves are going to be absolutely massive

Sure, even with decentralized oracles there's not a 100% guarantee that the API provider will never be hacked or tampered with, but it's at the level of trust where you can be 99.99% sure that it will carry out its function correctly. Perfect oracle doesn't exist because even if there are 100,000 individual oracle nodes, they still have to rely on say 10 different API sources, but the fact that it can and will read from multiple different API sources and punish bad nodes with loss of funds, the security is extremely high since the chance that multiple API providers would be hacked at the same time or would collude with each other about a private contract that they don't know about is ridiculously tiny.
Trust is always required, even with Bitcoin you are trusting Blockstream not to be malicious and you are trusting the huge mining pools not to collude. Did you know that just 3 biggest BTC mining pools own over 51% of the hashrate? That's effectively 3 people who could collude to attack bitcoin and succeed. There's always trust required, even with BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:10:04

I don't usually like to shill coins that I hold, but there is one project that specifically focuses on this. ChainLink is a project that basically aims to create a decentralized network of oracles that can deliver data to these smart contracts reliably and in a decentralized fashion (well they have a testnet basically, probably will be deployed on mainnet in the next few months). I highly suggest reading their [whitepaper]( if you are interested or going through their [github](
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:50:32
Decentralized exchanges are quite big and awesome. Etherdelta (or forkdelta lately), IDEX, Radar Relay and more. 
There's marketplaces like Ethlance (used for decentralized hiring and jobs) or Name Bazaar (for selling ethereum ENS domains).
Dai is amazing as well, effectively a stable token like Tether, except it's fully decentralized and basically run by a community DAO.
As you mentioned cryptokitties can be quite fun and there are other types of games like that.
There's cryptospeech which is effectively something like a decentralized twitter, except the messages there are stored forever.
And there's bunch of other marketplaces, services that are both currently operational and/or currently in development. Bunch of coins also use decentralized voting through Ethereum on important issues. And I can't forget about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations which are imo the most exciting application of smart contracts and many coins and tokens have their own DAO, but the capabilities of a DAO obviously goes far beyond tokens and their management.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:21:38
If there's another hard fork by blockstream, they can't force you to upgrade your node but you will be stuck on a version of BTC nobody will use. And the mining pools are companies that are collectively owned by 3 people who can decide to do whatever they want and while the pools consist of hundreds of people, the people mine whatever the mining pool tells them to mine.

Everyone has a GPU in their PC, but ASICs are extremely expensive computers that can only mine bitcoin.

Are you seriously suggesting that ASICs which are the  reason why bitcoin is centralized are a good thing? Jesus fucking christ.
And ethereum can handle 4x the transactions of bitcoin and even when cryptokitties were happening and the network was peaking at 1.3 million transactions per day the average cost was $1.5 per tx compared to BTC’s $40 per tx with their 400,000 transactions per day. If cryptokitties ran on BTC the network would still be congested today. Not to mention ethereum has a REAL, non-centralized way of scaling with Sharding, unlike the lightning network.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:57:09
Also, I don't see where you're seeing that the dao had 4% consensus. The ethereum hodlers themselves literally voted on the hard fork with their ETH.

Who says it was a bug? If code is law and the BTC blockchain is immutable, it should have been kept as it is and any malicious actors should have gotten away with it. Who's to decide that something is a bug that has to be fixed and something else is "code as is" which shouldn't be forked?
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:39:40


Made me laugh, really. Ethereum and smart contracts are a massive blockchain use case that you don’t even realise, far bigger than a currency that nobody uses for paying (because it can go up and down in value 30% per day). From decetralized exchanges to decentralized lending systems, decentralized betting, payment gateways, prediction markets, decentralized fiat and stocks and much much more only possible with smart contracts. It’s the reason why all the massive companies care about ETH and not BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:41:19
They are scared that Ethereum will soon overtake Bitcoin as the  currency and all exchanges will start using ETH as the main trading pair, effectively ending the only use bitcoin currently has. So they are willing to make up bullshit about how Ethereum is centralized and how it's a fraud and a scam. The day ETH overtakes BTC in market cap will be a very happy and fun day.

@_date: 2017-10-09 22:50:27


There are solutions being worked on right now to fix it. For example it is not neccesary to store the transaction data on all nodes, just on full nodes and most nodes just need to store the information about how many coins everyone has.


We will know for sure when POS gets released.


TheDAO was huge. It was only bailed out because majority of the community agreed on it.


Not really an issue of Ethereum, I guess ICOs are a little neccesary evil and the product of a free market. Nobody forces anybody to invest in them.


They wouldn't move to it if they weren't sure if it works.


Vitalik is awesome and as you said, he's a central figure only in terms of PR. 


Not sure what you are talking about here.
I personally find the bitcoin community worse than the ethereum community. Not bad by any means, just worse than Ethereum's. Main reason is all these forks where nobody agrees on anything, everyone argues with everyone, some people want to stick to "Satoshi's vision" while others want to change bitcoin radically. It's a mess.
Ethereum's community (apart from ETC which we don't talk about) is all about innovation. Everyone is excited about hard forks, because they understand it's just an update to Ethereum, nobody is creating million useless forks, people aren't arguing and all seem to be pro-innovation. That's jut my two cents anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:00:50

Sealand doesn't have a land, it's just a platform on the sea, thus it cannot be recognized as a country.

The founder is from Czech republic. But I don't think that Czech is official language. It is stated on the site, but more people agree with English.
When it comes to that border, there has been a dispute between Croatia and Serbia and it was not solved, so none of the countries own the land.

From what I know, the founder (aka president of the Free Republic of Liberland) has said that they want to create their own cryptocurrency. I believe that if they won't success with creating their own, they will adopt bitcoin. There is even big discussion about it on the forum and people mention it often on the official facebook page.
They even have [official bitcoin donation address](

Yes, that is what I'm suggesting. We constantly see things like censorship on youtube, censorship on reddit and all over the internet. China has their great firewall with massive surveillance of citizens and censorship of any website or application they don't agree with. There is tremendous value in decentralized code execution and Ethereum and similar platforms are trying to achieve a more fair, decentralized and free internet.
Also, blockchain's inefficiency is something Ethereum is trying to solve with sharding and plasma.

He can advocate for a fork, but if miners, nodes and the community don't agree it just won't happen. If people just blindly listen to him about anything, then that's not centralization, that's just democracy and freedom of decision. It's also important to remember that for a fork to happen 51% of people would have to agree, so a majority. A blockchain shouldn't be this system that can never be modified, it should be a system that gives power to the people, to the majority, including modification of that system if the majority approves.

Sounds like a real nice argument, doesn't it?

What does that mean if I live in EU? I'm verified on localbitcoins, if I want them to delete my data will they be forced to do it if I ask?

Circle is great, but what I hate about them is that they forgot to change the [date on their website to 2015]( God damn it Circle, do something about it, it's pain for my eyes!

I know but it is about the value of btc. Do you think that average greek person have just 250 dollars worth of money? Some people have life spendings of thousands of dollars which would be several bitcoins per person and there is only 13 mil btc currently. Not enough for 10 million greeks...

Please does anyone have .apk? My device is being shown as incompatible (it isn't because every "incompatible" app works on it) so I can't download it :(

There is only non-HD version so far: [part 1]( and [part 2](
For HD version, it's going to be released very soon, I would check  and  and search for '*Inside Man S03E05*' and refresh the page once in a few minutes

If you have a webcam, you could try to use [Bluestacks]( It's basically android emulator for games, but you can also use it for apps like Circle and then scan the QR code using webcam.

He's a cool guy, really. He stands on people's side and 'fight' against governments that validate people's privacy.
[There's a great documentary about him where he explains lots of stuff](

Actually, there are 7 ATMs.

Service that does not validate people's privacy is a shady operation?

@_date: 2015-02-28 22:18:13
Exactly. I'm wondering who came with that idea. It seems completely illogical. With current price of 250 USD per bitcoin and supply of approx 13 mil. coins there is no way there would be enough btc for even just half the greece citizens.

I've heard he has to do something with some coins. Is he like a dealer who sells metal coins?

I have to say I was pretty surprised when I saw EUR Wallet in my coinbase account today.

Give them something free if they pay with bitcoin. It might be something unexpensive that would cost you none to very low money and offer that each time someone pays with bitcoin, maybe some unexpensive snack. When some people hear free, they would do anything to get it but you would have to include a visible text that you are offering it under the bitcoin logo.

84 people? There's a czech bitcoin group on facebook that has 1100 people and there's probably way more people using it than that.
