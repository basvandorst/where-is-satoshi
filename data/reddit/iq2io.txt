"...two opposing things can be correct."No this is absolutely false- what i assume you mean is often times humans fail to describe something at an atomic concept level. Thus both sides (sadly only 2 in the case of current majority politics) have statements of truth about ancillary topics. Do not mistake multi-facted concepts as being atom &amp; both sides being capable of truth. Mathmatically, physically, &amp; logically this is entire impossible. If you focus on one particular topic it must always be binary. If atomic concepts are not binary (true or fales), then no thing is true, nothing exists, &amp; nothing can ever be known. What your sentence is espousing is absolutely the reason why violence exists- people are ok with things that "sound good, or sound correct," they do not study it to the point of atomic reality. Everything is either true or not- it just so happens humans suck at describing things atomically.

Easy: all participants, decentralization optimizes costs to ensure each node is self sufficient at a minimum &amp; supports other nodes in the network at various levels of scale depending upon the node &amp; protocol.

If done correctly decentralized systems are far more efficient &amp; can trend towards 100% optimal efficiency if nodes are autonomous or based upon protocol fractionalization (say for consensus validation) functionally autonomous (100% of the compute / stor required for a given nodes TX is served by it's own node or equivalent thereof- 10% processing of 10nodes TX work).

Why don't you just say it in Spanish? not sure I understand what your saying in English, people could probably better understand it in Spanish, or even translate it for you.
