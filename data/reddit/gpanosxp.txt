Wasn't it just the deposits/withdrawals being shut down ? I though trading will continue without issues.

Don't know about the last step, but if you want 0 fee when you buy on gdax, make sure you select 'limit' order.

let's be realistic, fingerprints first, then dna,
...and just like 1 id is not enough currently, you will have to submit 2 samples

^ This, but GDAX requires a hell lot of identification.

It's shitty polices like these that should be discussed more often. We can't do anything under "x" amount is just bullshit. They wish take their fee, which they decided to be 0.1BTC to recover your deposit. *Their work is totally independent of the amount of BTC you deposited.* It's not like they will be compensated further if you had deposited 10k. Thank you for taking the time to share this with us. You should definitely bookmark the address link to check if they ever decide to move the amount.

I was referring to the arbitrage opportunity. China is dumping bitcoin (and other coins) like there's no tomorrow, so BTC's price is 10% lower in Chinese exchanges. If one had access to CNY and was a trader at a Chinese exchange, he could make huge profit "importing" cheap BTC from China.

Also, don't forget to check the withdrawal fees, which are in many cases much higher than the network fee (like 1mBTC for many exchanges)
