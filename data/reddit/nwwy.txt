"ADRA Germany" would be really wonderfull. Since i dont work there i cant apply with your form but we already donate a few € each month and they could do so much more with "The Pineapple Fund". :)

Scam, dont buy.

You Guys? Thats my first comment on a thread like this and is totally obvious that you are trying to scam people to buy a useless wallet.dat to gamble for their luck. it bet for 99,9% you just created a new wallet.dat file, put a strong password on it and try to scam as many people as possible for 15$.
Edit: and btw OP is a New Account since 2 Days. Screams even more Scam.

What would happend if there where Bitcoins in the Wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:05:19
 supports encryption and has a nice design for printing.

What happens if i have my Coins in a encrypted paperwallet? Can i just wait half a year till all is setteld and then choose wich coin i want to have when i cash in the Paperwallet? If i understand replay protection correctly then i just can use the private key one time and then i have to choose if i want BTC or B2X? Not like it was with BTC/BCH where i got both coins.

Breadwallet for iOS. Just scan the QR Code and sweep the entire balance.
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:53:18
A DIY Version would be really great to have. best of both worlds. :)
Thanks for the honest answer and good luck with your buisness. ;)

Good Luck ;)

We dont know yet or i dont know yet. I would wait till the dusts settels cause B2X dosent have replay protection. So i would be extra carefull what i do.

Looks like a normal Private Key then. Are you importing it from this screen? Sorry its in german. But shoud look the same.  You then have to touch "Scan private key" and it should switch to a qr code camera.

I use OPT Auth on iOS and it can backup my 2FA Secrets encryptet inside the App. Then i can export it with iTunes File Sharing or other export options.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:15:22
No problem. Yes stick with breadwallet and get a backup of your seed words on handwritten paper. If you want to switch to cold storage i recommed bitcoinpaperwallet.com

The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 130 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 29,380 satoshis.

If there is no balance then you cant import the private key or breadwallet will say "No balance on this Adress" or so.

Im using this one ( on a offline computer. I download it on a USB Stick and boot Linux on an air gapped machine.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:28:35
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:54:01
Check with "papercheck" if there is a balance on the adress. If the secret key dosent scan maybe try to scan it with a normal qr code scanner and import it by hand into Electrum on your PC.
Normally it should work like biologischeavocado said.  You then have a Button that says "Scan private key".

You dont controll the private key. So not your decision what happens with split coins.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:31:00
Where did you generate these? The design looks good.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:24:26
How do i know that you did not save the private keys of every card? Right i dont. It would be better to maybe put a transparent sleeve in there where i can put in my own offline printed paper wallet qr code. Nice idea but i would not buy it because i cant trust that my gift is not gone in the second i transfer it.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:43:11
Thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:01:17
When you scan the private key with a normal QR Code Scanner does it start with a 5 and looks sorta like this 5JpUxkoMbQY9qQwt1qunXeMzDnyH2bvrgPbvgQVY9bzkfCVnH?
DONT POST IT HERE!

I used ElectronCash after i moved my BTC out of the old Adress into a new paperwallet. Then i used Bitfinex to convert it and send it back to my new paperwallet. Took maybe 20mins and this is including booting a live usb linux stick.

Whoever controlls the Keys, controlls what happens with the Split Coins. So if Coinbase gives you the B2X AltCoin and says here is your new Bitcoin and keeps the "old" real Bitcoin for themselves you are out of luck. Even when they keep the B2X Coin for themselves then you cant cash out on these and get even more BTC. So you are loosing money this way or the other way. better to controll what you want to do with both of your coins. Even when you want to keep both.
