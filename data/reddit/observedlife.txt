"in the long run we are all dead"
- some dude I don't actually agree with but had a good quote that time

All of this is very applicable outside of crypto. Most of it is applicable outside of money. You have laid out some great truths.

Use Newegg

As silly as this seems, I can see it actually being beneficial to users who can't exactly cash out into a bank account... Like darknet vendors. This would allow vendors to collect in BTC while avoiding both banks and market fluctuation.

Dude... You need to get some help.

Cool! I'm in LA for the next couple days and will definitely stop by!

I hope it never changes. It's a nostalgic place.

Just out of curiosity, are you able to purchase a home in the U.S. with an offshore bank account directly and not have to repatriate/pay taxes on the money first?

You peaked my interest, but after some quick research, it doesn't seem easy at all to obtain citizenship of other countries unless you were born there or something (maybe that's what you meant). You can buy your way into some countries, but that's if you have hundreds of thousands to millions to spare.

I've spent some time in Barbados. While I love the place to death and also am a vehement supporter of Bitcoin, I don't see this happening in 18 months. Most places don't even have the capability to accept credit cards.

That's awesome. I spent my time in Christ Church and now have a place to go back to. I can be pretty cynical. But if you are seeing it, that makes me happy. I love Barbados.

Yes, that is exactly why it isn't taking off in the US or otherwise. People aren't dependable, but you can almost always depend on them not understanding cryprocurencies

Yes, they have phones. If u go there it is extremely apparent. They love getting new numbers and making friends - one of the reasons I am in love with the place. But that means nearly nothing. They will do whatever, and mostly rely on the physical form of the Barbadian dollar. It is rare to find someone that  accepts credit cards. Phones are expensive and people use them only for calls and texting. They won't accept a crypto currency any time soon. The infrastructure isn't in place. And more importantly , the culture isn't either.
I say that as a huge fan of Barbados and a huge fan of Bitcoin.

Cody's book is pretty decent
