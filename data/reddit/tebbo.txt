I can't believe this is even a question. Clearly blockchain technology would be awesome to have. The problem right now is that we can't verify votes. If we could verify that we votes, we just have to avoid bribery. Which, I don't think would be that big of an issue, especially if we made it illegal.

Seriously though, you think it's OK Andreas can whine and get 1.5 mil? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:11:44
Right? That's what I don't get. 
Andreas isn't struggling. He isn't on food stamps. He isn't some poor cypherpunk. 
"Oh let's just give this well-to-do guy 1.5 mil!"
Not like that money could have been better spent on a worthwhile endeavor. No, let's give this rich dude a second chance at being mega rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:13:12
Yeah I get it. 
Personally I don't feel very sympathetic towards someone who had multiple opportunities and 1.5 mil doesn't make that much of a difference to. 
I wouldn't be surprised if he donated the 80% secretly to himself  just to get people to give him the other 20.

Ok. I do gloss over a lot. It's a comment not a thesis. I was more trying to refer to the limited nature of bitcoin. It is not a faulty assumption, it's a historical observation. 
Bitcoin holdings are affected by inflation. I'm inferring that bitcoin is rising faster than the rate of inflation (historical bias). 
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:03:40
Well here's the thing. Today yes you would get that $1 bag of chips. The federal reserve then prints 100 million new dollar bills (not an accurate measure). Now your bag of chips costs $1.25 and your $1.00 is the same value. 
Bitcoin is a limited quantity. Inflation will still occur, but as bitcoins get lost/stolen they become more and more rare. The payout for miners becomes smaller and smaller. This doesn't matter much, but there is a phenomenon of them becoming spread amongst more and more hands. If 5 people have 4 million bitcoin each, it's not that hard to get 5 of them (assuming these people are distributing). If 20 million people have 1 bitcoin each. Now getting 5 whole bitcoin is much more labor intensive.

Besides what others have already said, here is my beef. 
I have worked in IT support and service for a few years now and one thing I hate more than anything is clients with Intuit products. 
From an IT standpoint it offloads a lot of control over certain things, which honestly is just a mild annoyance. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if the support wasn't so god awful terrible. Last time I was on the phone support I began begging for mercy 4 hours in. Literally. I was on the phone with someone with a very thick Indian accent and I was begging for mercy. 
Their support is horrible, but that would be OK if their product works. It doesn't. It fucks up all the time. Users are stupid, but this program seems to accentuate that to the maximum. It crashes, acts oddly, doesn't mesh well with network/security schemas, is bad at data management, it's bloated, fucks up with simple drivers all the time, and many more problems I can't think of right now. Literally I have had more problems with Intuit software of varying varieties than any other suite. 
The software wouldn't be so bad either, if it weren't for the fact that it completely pigeonholes you into being Intuit's bitch. Oh you need to do task X? Well you have to do it through the software. Oh the software doesn't support it? Here's Expansion for X @ 12.99 a month. You need installation help? 5.99. I can guarantee you it won't work right after the first few days. You want to switch to a new software? Sure you can, but we only really export things in formats used by Intuit software. Other formats are incredibly complex and need a lot of data management for migration. On top of this, you'll lose out on all the peripherals and knowledge you've gained over the time you've had the software. Good luck training all your employees on a new system! 
And you know what? ALL OF THIS. ALL OF THIS WOULDN'T BE SO BAD. I could take all of this, except for this last thing. 
They release a new version of every type of software every year. You have to pay for the new version every year if you want to keep getting "decent" support. After 4 years, support is dropped. That's it. I've literally had an Intuit staff member tell me over the phone:


Prices for new versions of core software (not to mention extras that you may have) are upwards of $700+. If they discontinue a feature you need, or a different peripheral, TOUGH SHIT. Can't get it anywhere else and everything they do is proprietary. Just bend over and take it.
Small business uses this software, gets roped into this scheme and sees it's profits pay into Intuit's corporate structure (one of my clients is a small gift shop and pays upwards of 1200.00 a year for Intuit software which I have to come and fix/train people on all the time). 
They're horrible. Despicable. Deplorable. They are everything that makes me hate the Software industry. They have every terrible technology policy available and they're too big to fail. They're too big to stop. They eagerly buy up any hope at innovation and change in the market and just meld them into their shitty corporate suites. 
**TL;DR Fuck Intuit.**

That's if the market is good for opportunities like bitcoin, but the public is slow to adopt, with mass adoption efforts coming only after 2020.

People can move money around and manipulate the market up and down. it's the main reason why bitcoin is so volatile. Thing is though, that's only because the market is so small. If the market cap increases, even the wealthiest nation in the world could have trouble shifting it up or down 1%.

Blue is more like pure wizardry. There are a lot of rules in blue that aren't necessarily laws (see, "unless pays" and other various blue "choice" cards). The thing about Magic and wizardry in general (and the reason blue's the purest form of it) is that very powerful wizards lose their minds among the many ways to contort and control magical power. Many abilities often negate or run completely contrary to other abilities and a lot of blue cards can even break the standard mechanics of the game (like skipping turns, phases, etc). Blue actually has so many powers, it's pretty hard to make an all-blue deck because it is so diluted. 
White on the other hand, although very bureaucratic tends to have power in consistency. Don't do this, don't do that. Heal, battle manuevers, protection, etc.  
Dammit, now I want to build a deck.

I mean, that is the more specific definition, but many people choose to say propagation to refer to this effect. I know it's generally pretty quick, I'm a web dev myself, but occasionally you have that one pesky DNS server who refuses to update the cache for an additional amount of time. That's why you have the warning on all registrars when changing DNS that it could take between 1 and 48 hours.
