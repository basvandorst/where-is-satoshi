What is the best service to be able to buy bitcoin with PayPal?

2 weeks ago when Gemini was down for maintenance everyone was saying to leave and join gdax.

The people that had a net loss this week are the ones that bought BTC 3 weeks ago, not the ones that have been hodling for months/years.

It hit 15K for the first time dec 7, so saying a lot of folks lost money simply isn’t accurate.
Also, how tf did you lose most of it if you’ve had it since 2013? Only way that’s possible without selling early is if you gave it away.

See, that's confusing, because you sure make it sound like you were talking about yourself: 


Regardless, it's unclear what were you trying to exemplify here. Even if you bought at the highest BTC was in 2013, your profits would have "crashed" to over 1000%.

Yeah, i did, but I can't view it that narrowly. Gotta have the long-term approach.

My goodness

"Is it a currency? Is is an asset?" 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:51
about to hit 17 too. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:36:49
It was like 3 weeks ago 11k was the ATH. And it “crashed” to that. Hmm
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:26:36
“you were all” lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:37:38
So what was the example you were trying to make...? How someone that bought in 2013 would have lost everything and only sold for 1000% more?

The best educated guess will be just as accurate as a random guess.

I'm waiting for my accounts to clear. Been spending th last few weeks doing as much research as I can so I know what I'm getting myself into. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:30:22
There isn't, otherwise the entire market would be broken. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:13:57
$600 for all that? For real?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:18:47
It’s official: you’re just a troll. Move along, everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:28:51
So your reason for being on this sub is to let us know that?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:54:00
Should he have waited a few months? /s
@_date: 2018-10-29 10:44:33
Me likey!
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:15:43
Inaccurate 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:28:18
What would you recommend instead
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:07:23
ah interesting
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:28:05
Thanks a lot 
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:17:29
To be fair there have been a lot of technologies people felt very confident about but never panned out.
