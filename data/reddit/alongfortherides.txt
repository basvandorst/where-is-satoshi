You're right, thepast does not equal the future, however, many smart investors look at daily charts and when looking at daily charts the technical analysis still looks good.  This is the difference between guys who make a lot and guys who scream the sky is falling.  I have done quite well by looking at daily charts and not overreacting to corrections.  I know the point when I will agree that the ship is sinking - as people have been saying for years.  We haven't reached there yet.

It didn't hit that high until Nov. 15th, 2017 which was only 6 months ago.  So, yes, if you bought on that date then your 401k might be doing better.

Thanks so much for reposting this from years ago!  Wow, how encouraging to see all the people who remain negative and proclaim the death of bitcoin (they're still around today in this post) and the very few who could see thru the storms and make it to new heights.  Some of these comments from the faithful was like they had a crystal ball and could just see through anything.  Awesome!

If you go back and read this forum four years ago there was the same exact people saying the same exact things.  And guess what?  Those people would have been filthy rich today if they would have stopped fudding and just bought in.

The fundamentals on the yearly chart still look good.  Might go to $7300 or so.  Stop looking at hourly charts and take a breath.

You better check your numbers again.  8 months ago to the day bitcoin was around $3773.  Today we are looking at $7570 - that's a 200% ROI in eight months.  Please tell me what your 401K was invested in to make more than 200% in eight months because I have never heard of that.

Good news in this red...bitcoin is still up 230% from one year to date.  Where else are you going to earn that kind of ROI (return on investment)?  A good stock broker might get you 6-10%.  For those of you who bought high...welcome to cryptoland.  Just wait it out or sell to the wiser investor.

Sorry not to clarify, the fundamentals of technical analysis.  In other words, on a yearly chart we are still seeing growth and it hasn't broke any major support lines.  Now, if it dips below $6400 then we would say that it has broken the yearly trend line we will make decisions from there.

This is a market correction that needed to happen.  Zoom out your charts to one year, make a straight line on the lows and you will see that with steady gains we should be around $7500.  We all know it went up way too much too quickly.  Just sit tight for the ride and buckle your seatbelts.

I'm sorry that you missed out and are angry at the world.

Did you sell any bitcoin for USDT?  If so, then don't blame it on the whales.  When all of the little people do the same thing then it becomes like many whales.

I guess George Soros just bought in!
