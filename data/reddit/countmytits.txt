I think to the left. For example, if $/BTC is $10,538.24 and you have .1 BTC then you can move it to the left and figure out that you have $1,053.82 worth of BTC (by moving the decimal from between the 8 and 2 to the left between the 3 and 8).

If you have .1 you can just move the decimal to the left and that’s your holdings in fiat.

I mean that isn’t there a limitation to how many transactions can be processed in a given time frame so it couldn’t ever really be used for mainstream merchant payments? Wouldn’t that negatively impact potential value?

It’s supposedly safe but not as much as a hardware wallet disconnected from the internet in a fireproof safe in your home. No one can hack that.

They will have to have an anti money laundering compliance program in place because they will be considered a money service business to FinCEN just like crypto exchanges.

No its not backed by the FDIC at all. It is however backed by another insurer.

Thought the same. Not sure why you are getting downvoted.

But only 10% of your gain not your whole basis. It won’t put you in the red unless it is combined with fees and the spread.

He likely meant the transactions will be processed through the US financial system which will block and freeze transactions subject to sanctions. Bitcoin is not regulated like the US financial system so it is much easier to avoid sanctions.

Cashapp spreads are bigger than a porn stars asshole. Unless you’re a small retail investor i would avoid. It’s constantly at about $100-150 spread.
