What a joke that website is.
"Let the richest person decide! Also, let them vote several times with the same money!"


Addresses 2,3,7 with 5k appearing to be 10k belong to 1 person and feed directly into each other


2 and 3 same guy, 9400, same coins. 
Several 1000k on the other side do exactly the same, all 1 Person


The most obvious one.
The same person on votes 3-17 (8500) on one, and 4-9 on the other side.
You can check for yourself with this nice graphical blockchain explorer, 
So basically a few rich guys voicing their opinion, and cheating while doing it. 
I thought we were trying to get away from that.
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:18:47
So, is there a solution to routing yet? 
@_date: 2016-04-23 22:17:59
So a few guys with lots of coins are "the economic majority"?
1 guy has 10k coins. 5000 people have 1 coin.
Even if 5000 vote against him, somehow their opinion does not count, because they are the minority?
And as I said, the biggest joke is that the site does not even try to check if it's just one person trying to articifially make 5000btc look like 15.000, and/or one person trying to appear as several people.
I understand the idea and that measuring the "economic majority" is hard, and believe consider.it to be equally flawed.
But not even trying to avoid sybil voting makes bitcoinocracy just completely useless.

It's really simple, either your transaction gets included into a block or not.
Whether it is included or not is decided only by the miners. If your fee makes the miners a profit, it will be included. If it is unprofitable to them, it will be dropped.
So either Bitcoin is permissionless and everyone simply pays what they think is appropriate to use it, or you have a central institution telling people what the "right" fee is and forces miners to comply. (good luck with that)
If miners are happy to include a transaction because it was paid for, you and I simply don't have any say in that. Your only options are to either pay up or leave. If someone else was willing to pay enough to make the miners happy to include their spam, then it's none of your business anymore.
I don't like it, but that's the way current Bitcoin works.

By broadcasting an older channel state.
Simplified, I pay you through a channel, but later broadcast an older channel state where I still have all my coins.
To defend against this you only have to watch your channels 24/7 and then broadcast a „revocation transaction“ which would stop my attack.

Not a finance guy, but here‘s how I understand it:
A real futures contract would be:
I say I will buy 1 BTC in 30 days for the price of 10.000 USD.
You believe in 30 days it will be worth only 9000, so you enter the future contract with me because you‘ll make 1000 profit if the price is only 9000.
In a real futures contract you need to deliver 1 real BTC to me.
In cash settlement you don‘t need to have that 1 BTC, I will just pay you the difference between the contract price (10.000) and the market price (9000), so I just give you the 1000 USD. 
So it‘s really just a bet on the BTC price. I think in 30 days it will be X, you think it will be Y. We agree to pay each other the difference when the time comes, and nobody needs to have any real BTC for making that bet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:45:42
Why do you need „justification as to why it‘s better“ if you‘re so obviously convinced that it‘s not?
Everyone in the market has their own opinion and acts accordingly, so if you believe Cash has no chance anyway, just move on and ignore it.

Your math is massively off.

Scalability is currently being worked on,
there is a roadmap for faster initial download of the whole chain, how to prune the chain to be more efficient, higher transaction volume, how bigger blocks can be implemented, and how miners would be incentivized to include as many tx as possible.

I think of it like 3 security levels:
Vault/Safe - Cold storage on paper, possibly in an actual safe.
Bank Account - Wallet on your computer, ideally a hardware wallet.
Cash - Phone wallet.
Biggest security risk here is the transfer from cold storage to online wallet. For secure transfer the cold wallet should only be handled on an offline machine, altough if your computer is compromised the attacker will hopefully already have emptied your local wallet before you import the cold storage.
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:41:47
If it wasn't transferred via the blockchain.info site, someone still must have gotten a hold of the backup file. Maybe your gmail account is still compromised, and someone accessed it via IMAP.

Gold advocates are missing the point that Bitcoin is replacing fiat, not gold.

Several possible reasons in two main categories.
Ideological Reasons:
Any combination of 
- "I don't trust banks"
- "Governments/Central Banks are (possibly deliberatly) bad at managing the money supply"
- "The power over money creation and management should be with the people using it, not a select few"
- "PayPal/Western Union/Visa/Mastercard are horrible and should die" 
- Can be used by anyone in the world without permission.
Practical (depending on your circumstances)
- Can be cheaper/faster to accept as a merchant
- Can be cheaper/faster for sending money abroad
- Can be safer to accept if you are worried about fraud
- Can be a store of value if your local currency is even less stable than Bitcoin
- Can be used by anyone in the world even if they don't have access to banking, as long as they have internet access.
That last one is big for billions of people who are unbanked, as they might leapfrog over banking/credit cards/paypal and start using digital currency directly, the same way many developing countries skipped over landlines for telecommunication and went straight to mobile networks.
But this does not apply to most people in the US/Europe, and Bitcoin still needs a lot more infrastructure and development to be used this way.

- Mining algorithm: like SHA256 (Bitcoin, Namecoin), Scrypt (Litecoin, Doge), CryptoNight (Monero etc.) and others or even different approaches like Ripple/Stellars consensus (no mining). 
Some claim to be "ASIC-resistant", the idea being that everyone can mine without special hardware, which would be great, but it is inefficient and susceptible to botnets. Also most of them aren't ASIC-resistant anyway.
- Proof-mechanism, "Proof of Work" or "Proof of Stake" or some other system to reach network consensus. 
PoW works, but is vulnerable to 51% attacks, and uses a lot of energy. Securing the network without wasting electricity would be great, but so far there is no real alternative. PoS has the "nothing at stake" problem which makes it less secure, the Ripple consensus system is sort-of centralized and requires trust, and other approaches are still experimental.
- Feature set: 
Namecoin can store information pairs, like a domain name and the corresponding IP, or your real name and your PGP key.
Bitcoin could do that too, but if you're doing something that requires a blockchain, but not necessarily bitcoin, you can do it on a seperate blockchain.
Most other current coins can just be used as currency.
Some new coins promise a more developed scripting system, like Ethereum. 
Bitcoin and all clones are pretty limited, you can shuffle coins around and do some stuff like multisig. Future coins promise to be able to do a lot more, but so far it's all just whitepapers and ideas.
You said "major cryptos", but I'll include Monero again since its anonymity features are more advanced than those of any other coin. So far it seems to be truly anonymous. Still has a lot of problems though.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:43:17
Gold, silver and other metal coins were used concurrently because it was more convenient for different tiers of commerce/purchases.
Not needed with Bitcoin.
Also: every coin (or every currency really) is a network. The utility of it depends on how many people are already on the same network, and its utility increases with every new participant. See telephones or facebook.
It makes no sense to use another network if no one else uses it. The only thing that could happen is that a new network appears which improves upon the first one in such a massive way that people are willing to bear the cost of switching. (again, myspace -&gt; facebook)
Unless that happens, every other network is bound to fail, since it makes more sense to stick with the biggest one.
There is a place for altcoins, for testing features or doing different things, but as a currency the biggest one wins.
So far no alt has such massive improvements that it would entice users to switch. 
The ones that claim to do so are either lying or don't even have a working system yet.
So there's a chance that a superior coin is developed (with features impossible to include into the Bitcoin code), but as a currency it would then take over, and not be used concurrently.

Yeah don't even bother linking to it, someone might read it.
Assuming you mean this fucking joke of a "whitepaper": 
It contains exactly 0 (Zero) information on anything except marketing fluff.
But let's see:
- Centralized IM with servers hosted by the company. 
- Messages are encrypted using a proprietary mechanism, no further information given.
- Supply and Distribution of gems: (numbers actually missing from that waste of cloud storage they call a whitepaper:)
- 450Mio to stakeholders, 450Mio distributed as daily Airdrop rewards during ~5 years after launch 
How much you get per airdrop depends on how many people you invited and how many gems you bought in the presale.
Why do I need those idiotic tokens in the first place?
Ah yes, because advertisers ( and anyone not in my friend list ) now need to pay to contact me, so this will cut down on spam. What they pay goes back to the users via airdrops.
Amazing, and the value comes from....?
I'm not getting spammed in Threema, which has proprietary encryption but is at least documented, I'm not getting spammed in Signal, which is still centralized, but open-source. And free. Without tokens. 
So why exactly do I want to use this proprietary centralized messenger? Because I am getting tokens from the people paying to send me advertisements. Which I can use to......
Maybe send other people advertisements. Or to be able to contact people not yet on my friend list.
I'm not calling it a scam yet, despite the fact that there is a crowdsale of worthless tokens while providing 0 information on anything.
I will call anyone stupid enough to buy those a complete idiot though.

Security is still a huge issue.
It will be fixed by hardware wallets. Like the Trezor, and mobile versions of it. 
Currently security is nowhere near the point where it can be safely used by everyone. But once we have cheap mobile hardware trezors with 2 buttons (ok &amp; cancel), it should be safe enough.

In the event of Bitcoin being the only currency used in the world, it would not necessarily gain 10% of purchasing power every year.
Since it is the only currency in this scenario, you will still have to spend money on necessities like food or rent. 
Besides that there is time preference, people buy new phones and notebooks NOW instead of later, and lots of people use credit to buy things instead of waiting, saving and not paying interest.
If everything in the world is priced exclusively in BTC, purchasing power would move only with increase/decrease of productivity and general economic growth/decline, on a global scale.
So assuming increase in productivity leads to 2% more purchasing power per year, people would still want to invest in things that provide 5% or more return.
You are right though, some people (me) hope that it would indeed lead to people saving more instead of buying stuff they don't need, and also look more carefully at what they invest in, since no one will bail you out if it fails.
The first part (everyone stops mindless consumption, and prefers saving) would surely slow down the economy, but besides not being such a horrible scenario, I also really don't see that happening anytime soon.
When it happens, then the hope is that only companies providing high-quality products will survive, since people will think more carefully than today whether they should really part with their coins.
The bigger consequence in this scenario is that hopefully misguided investments leading to giant bubbles won't happen as easily.
If people prefer to hold their coins on their trezors or credsticks, and banks can only lend out what they have in deposits, then I have to give them coins first, and I'll demand total transparency of what they are investing it in. 
Finally, yes, in this scenario governments would use taxes to maintain control, as it would be the most effective (or only) tool they have left to influence the economy and generate revenue.
...and since I'm an optimist, I hope that this would lead to more prudent and transparent government spending.

You are absolutely right, what you describe is already being researched, see for example 
So there's a very good chance that this is going to happen, or already happening.
However, hopefully implementations of coinjoin+stealth addresses like darkwallet will bring more anonymity.
If that fails, there are already more anonymous coins available and being developed, for example the "[Cryptonote]( like Monero or the unfinished [ZeroCash]( which are quite different from Bitcoin and provide a higher degree of anonymity through different approaches.
Cryptonote-coins still have some issues, and ZeroCash hasn't even started yet, but there is promising research being done to mitigate the privacy problem.
(And forget DRK, it's just a giant marketing stunt consisting of vanilla bitcoin + a broken coinjoin implementation )

Theoretically it should be easy:
1.) Device 1 creates a payment invoice in the form of an unsigned transaction.
2.) Unsigned transaction is sent to device 2 via NFC, device 1 then listens for an answer.
3.) Device 2 signs the transaction, sends signed transaction back via NFC.
4.) Device 1 receives signed transaction and broadcasts it to the internet.
I hereby nominate the Trezor team, Aaron Voisine and Bitpay to get together and whip up a specification how this can be done, hopefully in an opensource implementation so we can have a de-facto standard which could then be easily implemented in any wallet and any point of sale terminal.

It is not really that much easier to avoid paying taxes with Bitcoin.
Sure, it is slightly easier to hide some income as long as it never touches a bank account. But now you have "dirty" Bitcoins, and if you're trying to buy a yacht with it you will still have to explain where you got the money from.
There's also a good chance you will be required to keep a list of all addresses you received payments on. They'll then take them, throw them into some tracing software, and make you explain every single output that isn't showing up in your books as legitimate expenses.
So yeah, you can hide money, but it's really just the same as taking cash without a receipt. 
But any payment you receive and keep in your books becomes much easier to trace.
I'm not sure it will be the untaxable utopia so many libertarians and anarchists hope for.
But in the event that Bitcoin is the only currency left, at least governments would be forced to work with the funds they have instead of borrowing more, so that's something.

A problem with Occupy was the absence of shared productive goals, and that the few demands made lacked leverage.
Maybe Bitcoin can work with the next iteration of Occupy, as everyone can support it as long as they share the idea that taking away the power of money creation from the government is a good idea no matter what your political stance is otherwise.
...Which is also demonstrated here every day in the shouting matches between libertarians, anarchists and "statists" of all kind.
Another great effect is that it does not even require any politician or banker to follow any demands. You're unhappy with banks and monetary policy? Just opt out.
Because of this Bitcoin will probably be a cornerstone of the next Occupy, or whatever the next global protests are going to be called.

The "policy flexibility" that brought us QE did manage to avert widespread economic collapse, so good job on that.
But it failed to fix the underlying problems, and now that cheap QE credit is fueling the next bubble.
With Bitcoin, there would probably have been a larger fallout due to the inflexibility.
I argue that this would have been painful, but better in the long run, as it would have killed off a lot of unsustainable investments and allowed for a faster return to more sustainable ones.

So far I only read about malware that modified destination addresses either in the clipboard, or hooked into your wallet and switched the destination address after you hit "send".
Both of these attacks are mitigated by Trezor, as long as you check the destination on the Trezor.
What you describe would require the malware to intercept any webpage looking like a payment request, and switch addresses right on the webpage. 
Against this attack even breadwallet would not help.

All the problems aside, Bitcoin is still the most useful out of all the current coins.
That magical currency that you speak of with the efficient consensus system, no confirmation time and no security problems which also is really useful to Joe Public does not exist.
Bitcoin is the next best thing, it works, it can be used securely even though it's still a pain, and it buys the most stuff.
There's still lots of work to be done until it is ready for Joe Public, but so far Bitcoin is still in the best position to succeed, out of all the cryptos.

Does saying that I consider both forks as legitimate contenders for the "brand" name make me a "bcash troll"? I hold both in equal amounts simply because I have no clue which approach will prove to be right in the end. Lots of people from both sides are pretending they already know, but I'd prefer to see data to prove it, which is still scarce. And so far both networks work as intended.
I'm also not a fan of either side claiming to be "the real bitcoin". The original Bitcoin is dead, both current approaches are quite different from Bitcoin in 2010.

Not solved yet.
However, so far PoW through mining has worked very well, while alternatives are still unproven and potentially less secure, so we're stuck with it for now.
But there is also still hope it might decentralize again.
First we hit the hardware ceiling. While it is still possible now to build more efficient mining chips, eventually they'll be at the same level as current general purpose CPUs, at which point they could become inexpensive commodities. 
And mining migrates to places with cheap, or even free, energy. This is already happening now, as miners move to places like iceland because they have cheap and renewable energy.
This does not yet solve anything, but in the long run it could work out, assuming that energy is slowly being decentralized as well and will eventually be nearly as cheap as in iceland no matter where you are.
This is of course a very optimistic long-term outlook.
In the short term we simply have no solution yet. But so far the mining companies seem to realize that decentralization is one of the main value propositions of Bitcoin, and that taking too much marketshare and doing something stupid would destroy their business model.
So far that has sort-of worked.

Stellar is just a rebranded Ripple with a fairer distribution.
The idea is theoretically nice, send or exchange any currency via a hawala-like system.
But it still requires you to deal with exchangers, and instead of getting something "hard" like Bitcoin you just get an IOU to reclaim your money at some point. And when you exchange to another currency that IOU gets transferred to another "trusted" gateway/exchanger.
With one of the points of Bitcoin being trustless, AND because gateways are going to charge for conversion as well, it seems inferior to just working towards the possibility of simply staying within Bitcoin and not even converting back to fiat.

There is no way to know if a coin has been lost, or just hasn´t moved.
Putting a timer on coins is a horrible idea.
If your grandchildren inherit a Cascacius coin which has never moved, destroying it through a timer would only be a punishment for keeping it safe all those years.
Also you got the idea of "running on a single coin" completely wrong.
It works like this: if nearly all bitcoins are slowly lost over time, the value of the ones that are still around rises, as long as there is still demand for them.
Should it get to the point where it gets to unwieldy to use as a currency (because a single satoshi is now worth a small island), we can simply switch to a higher precision, so that satoshis can be divided into several million subunits.
tl,dr: timelock is a horrible idea. and should too many units be lost, we simply increase precision from 1.00000000 to 1.0000000000000000 or more.

I would love to see the people behind Trezor, Breadwallet, Mycelium and Electrum join forces and have it all under a single brand with all the best features, but of course that might already be sort of centralized. 
But it probably won't matter once everyone keeps to standards, and seeds and wallets are compatible between all apps.
Bonus list of current "best wallets" consensus:

Android: Mycelium
Desktop (software): Electrum/Multibit/Official Bitcoin Wallet (in that order)

Who started this idea of using the Blockchain for decentralized voting?
Even if you can use the Blockchain to count and verify votes, decentralization breaks down at issuing the keys.
So even if you manage to keep votes anonymous somehow, you still need some central entity to distribute 1 voting key per person, otherwise there is no way to verify that everyone voted only once.
Sorry, but I think the only useful decentralized "voting" application that could work would be crowdfunded projects. 
People can pseudonymously vote for a project with their money, if it gathers enough supporters and funds it gets built/coded, if not the supporters are refunded.
Besides that, I don't see how voting would work.

stolen from There are six characteristics that make something a good candidate for money/currency:
1.) Scarcity
2.) Durability
3.) Divisibility
4.) Transportability
5.) Recognizablility
6.) Fungiblility
The better something is in those six characteristics, the better suited it is at being a currency. A lot of things have value, but make poor currencies due to failings in one or more of those six areas (diamonds, bicycles, iron bars, etc.)
For thousands of years, gold checked most of those boxes and the migration to gold certificates helped solve gold's issue of divisibility for smaller values (it's a pain in the ass to try and weigh/divide grains of gold) And nowadays, fiat currencies try and optimize these characteristics as well:
1.) Scarcity: only a select group can create/print money
2.) Durability: most money is digital anyway and the paper notes are printed on durable paper/cotton hybrids or unique plastic-like materials
3.) Divisibility: There are various denominations plus coins
4.) Transportability: Paper is lightweight and pretty easy to fold up and put in your pocket, even in large amounts
5.) Recognizability: A ton of effort is put into making bills easy to recognize/difficult to counterfeit. Think of the inks, watermarks, hidden strips, etc.
6.) Fungibility: Any $1 bill is equal to any other $1 bill.
Bitcoin takes each of these characteristics out to the n-th degree. It is:
* mathematically scarce
* as durable as you want it to be (you can engrave a private key into tungsten if you like)
* divisible to 8 decimals
* as transportable as an email
* practically impossible to counterfeit
* and perfectly fungible.
It also allows you to transfer value digitally without the need for a third party.

Initially they can offer all the functionality of Bitpay and Coinbase for merchants.

I just tested it, and while it does look nice it is not a real standalone phone wallet like breadwallet or mycelium.
They require email and password before you can use it, so I assume it is just an app to control their webwallet and connected exchange.

Sounds secure, but you missed some points if you already tried so hard:
Creating the wallet on a computer that went online before and after wallet creation is an oversight. You should have created the wallet on an offline computer, only exported one address to load it, and securely erased it. Electrum also has a cold storage functionality for your exact use case.
Also the deleted wallet.dat *should* be gone, but you should have made sure to use the "Empty Trash Securely"-Function of OSX.
Finally, it might have been easier to just save the  site to a usb and run it on an offline computer to create a paper wallet. But I suppose you wanted the 12-word seed.
Overall you should be safe, but there's still a tiny possibility your wallet.dat might be recoverable. If you want to remove that you should re-install mac os and during setup use disk utility to securely erase the whole disk (1-pass writing zeros).

You can see that I paid, but you only get the money once either you and I agree, or you and BitProtect agree. (Or me and bitprotect agree that you tried to rip me off)
Sort of like PayPal, except that BitProtect can only vote for one of us to receive to money, but can't access it.
Unfortunately this is not yet very viable due to the volatility, if you ship a physical item the value might fluctuate in the meantime, but you as the merchant probably don't want to take this risk.

Altcoins are not a good way to "diversify".
Currently Bitcoin is the largest, oldest and best-known of all coins. 
Should it fail completely, trust in similar coins is likely to evaporate as well.
Also the "Bitcoin is complacent" argument simply is not true. It has the largest number of active contributors, and the most active development of all coins. Just look at the comparison of the most important metrics of most coins at  
The "it´s slow" argument:
Bitcoin has the highest security of all POW-based coins. There are faster POW-clones, but the cost to attack them is also significantly lower.
POS has the "nothing at stake"-problem, and is not proven to be as secure as POW.
It is also relatively safe to accept 0-confirmation transactions. Most people won´t try to defraud someone for a cup of coffee, and there are safety measures that can be taken by merchants. Like not accepting any incoming connections, checking that a transaction has a fee attached, and is not coming from an unconfirmed output.
For large transactions and especially online orders of expensive items the wait time is not as important, and the fraud risk is still lower then with all other payments systems.
Also, all merchants signed up via BitPay are already accepting 0-confirmation transactions, so the time to pay is around 1-5 seconds. That´s fast enough, and BitPay so far hasn´t seen a massive wave of fraud.
About the mining centralization: that´s indeed still not entirely solved, and of course something with the same security and less expended resources would be nice. 
But all alternatives are still unproven to provide the same security, so we´re stuck with it for now. 
And there´s still a good chance that it will move towards decentralization again once the hardware ceiling on mining chips is reached and there is more money to be made selling mining equipment than through mining itself.
tl;dr: if Bitcoin fails, altcoins aren´t safe either, and the arguments presented against Bitcoin are not very strong.

A true shitcoin has to have only marginal technical improvements or changes over Bitcoin, market these supposed improvements as unique and revolutionary, and have all the creators and most stakeholders know full well that the only point of the shitcoin is to separate people from their bitcoins or fiat.

No state would accept it voluntarily, as it means no seignorage and giving up a lot of control over the economy.
It is more likely to happen gradually, with more people trusting, holding and using Bitcoin. If trust in Bitcoin would surpass the trust in the official currency this process would accelerate, with more people preferring to hold BTC instead of official fiat, leading to a decline in value to the point where it is nearly worthless.
This is most likely to happen in states where the currency is mismanaged to a point where people are starting to notice the effects, and are looking for alternatives.
States will try to avoid it for as long as possible, but if each and everyone is already transacting in BTC, they will at some point say "screw it, just pay your taxes in bitcoin please, the official currency is now over." simply because it would be their only hope to get any revenue when no citizen wants to use fiat.

Lots of reasons that are simple to understand:
- Accessibility is still bad: Now relatively easy in the US through Circle and Coinbase, relatively easy in the EU as well, but hard anywhere else. Localbitcoins and Mycelium local trader usually come with steep markups and aren't as simple as Circle. We need Circle-style convenience all around the world.
- Security still sucks: Most people can't be trusted with computer security and don't trust themselves with it. Storage needs to be simple, secure and foolproof before most people trust it. Like "push this button to send, this one to receive"-simple. This will be fixed by Hardware wallets like Trezor, mobile hardware wallets, and "secure-enough" phone wallets like breadwallet.
- Volatility: Most people aren't comfortable holding money that still fluctuates wildly. Volatility will only decline when a lot more people trust it, and are willing to hold it as a store of value. This can only be improved through a larger number of users, which in turn requires all other points to be fixed first to improve trust.
- Usefulness: Still not enough places to spend it to be interesting for most people, since so far CC and online banking work great for them. It's already improving, but again, so far the risks involved in holding Bitcoin outweigh the risk of a CC theft or a Paypal freeze. Only when Bitcoin is as convenient and safe to use as CCs and online banking and can be used to pay everywhere,  people will consider using it as a CC replacement.
tl;dr It's not useful, secure and convenient enough for most people, and most don't give a shit about using it for ideological reasons.

I thought the arguments are pretty strong.
You can see an unconfirmed transaction within seconds.
In most cases where you would want to accept with that speed you do not need a confirmation, since you can safeguard against some attacks (check to accept only confirmed outputs, check for fee, allow no incoming connections), and in most cases it will be more effort to attempt a successful double spend than to just simply pay.
Besides, "Fast" means 1-3 seconds. If cryptocurrency wants to compete with things like apple pay or visa wave, this is the only acceptable speed.
This can not be fixed by a "faster" blockchain like doges or litecoins, even waiting a minute for a confirmation is simply too long. 
Security-wise it makes no difference, reversing 1 hour of transactions takes equal processing power in those chains, but Bitcoins blocktime allows for good network propagation with relatively few orphan blocks and divergent chains.
tl;dr: Not a problem.

Based on the BIS report I'd say that governments and central banks have tried to mitigate crises through policy, and succeeded in the short term, but ultimately failed.
The financial sector is thriving again, yet the real economy has still not completely recovered from 2008.
So this is where the theory comes in that maybe the economy would work just as well without constant interference through monetary policy.
While this viewpoint is controversial and against current mainstream economic theory, there is not much data to disprove that a "hard currency" on a global scale might work, as it is simply too new.
We have tried the current way, and it is only working for a few even in western democracies, so why not try a different approach.
But you are right, the first ones to try will be countries where monetary policy has already failed to a much higher degree.
And yes, there will still be bubbles.
If BTC is the stable global (reserve) currency, and everyone is hoarding their coins because they expect 1% deflation every year, people will still invest in things that promise 10 or 20 or 100% returns.
But while people will still create bubbles, there's a chance that Bitcoin lenders and banks will look much more closely what they invest in, as there will be no one to bail them out if they fail. And since lenders have to have coins in the first place to lend them out, there's a good chance they'll be held to higher standards than today for checking credit worthiness and giving out loans.
So there will still be bubbles, but the hope is that they might be flatter, and allowing banks and businesses to fail might ultimately speed up the recovery after a crisis.
A lot of hope and conjecture, I know, but This Is What Some Bitcoiners Actually Believe(tm)

Bitcoin does not fix wealth inequality, only some parts of the financial system. Inequality has be fought by other measures as well. 
It would of course have been great if everyone on earth just got an equal amount of coins and everyone would instantly agree that this is now money, resulting in instant equality (at least in coins).
Unfortunately this is not possible.
However, it fixes aspects of the current financial system that I consider to be broken and actually contributing to inequality.
Besides, it's still a bit early to compare inequality in bitcoin ownership to that of other currencies.

Well first of all governments would still ask where the money for that yacht came from when you reported only losses.
But besides that it is simple: if enough people would still think it's a good idea to fund fire departments, education, basic utilities used by everyone or maybe even universal basic income, then they will still pay taxes.
And I believe there are more people like that in the real world than the libertarians who seem to be quite loud in here. 
Governments would just be under a lot more pressure to spend more wisely, since they can't spend what they don't have and people would try harder to avoid paying taxes if they feel their money is wasted, especially on wars and surveillance.
Besides that I have a feeling that a lot of the libertarians here are from the US, in which case I can understand how "no government" seems like a viable alternative to the horribly broken system and economy the US has by now.
[edit:] While I don't believe in the libertarian theory that no government and free market would be ideal, I'd also prefer to see the current democratic system replaced with something that gives more power to the individual. Maybe some sort of direct democracy.

As for the "reversible transactions", those can be built in a paypal-like way on top of Bitcoin through multi-sig escrow, where they escrow can't even influence the transaction as long as it goes smoothly, and can only decide who gets money if there is a dispute.
Unfortunately there is no commercial service for this yet (that I am aware of), as the current volatility makes it unacceptable to wait for escrowed coins until a shipment is confirmed as having arrived.
But it is possible, and requires less trust than any current form of money transfer.
You are right though, currently you are at a disadvantage when you are the person sending coins.
That's also the reason for all the scrutinity when buying coins, they're just trying not to get ripped off, since all payment forms except bitcoin are reversible.
Once you are in Bitcoin, having reversible transactions is optional.

I am not sure how this decentralizing should work.
If you have several big centralized exchanges, you still have to trust them not to collude.
Here's a paper describing something similar, which would tie the issuance and price of coins to a commodity basket. This would be an automated process relying on data feeds (which you have to trust again).
[Hayek Money: the Cryptocurrency Price Stability Solution](
But not being backed by anything really is one of the main points of Bitcoin. You have no central authority and you don't have to trust anyone to keep their promise of redeeming your Bitcoins for something.
Instead its worth is determined by what value its users place on it, through freely trading it for whatever they like.
The volatility should decrease on its own the more people use it.

Since the idea is to create sidechains with a 1:1 peg, there is no impact on the "sound money" aspect.
There are only 2 scenarios:
1.) Nobody wants to use SideChainCoin. Since every scCoin is created through a 1:1 transaction from Bitcoin and everyone can switch back 1:1, noone loses anything.
2.) scCoin is immensely useful. This raises demand for scCoin and Bitcoin at the same time. Should scCoin turn out to be better then Bitcoin in every way, Bitcoin would be abandoned with everyone switching 1:1 to scCoin. Noone loses anything.
Please explain how that negatively impacts Bitcoin.
I´m more focused on the positive effect of instantly eliminating all useless altcoins and pump and dump schemes. All useful altcoins are implemented as sidechains, and their value is simply added to Bitcoin. And people can test new coins without any fear of losing any Bitcoin in the exchange.
The only ones losing here are the pump'n'dumpers, and the creators of useless clones holding crowdsales, "ICO"s or simply premining. I won't miss them.

(1) Is already happening, the recent campaign by the Venezuelan government against Bitcoin is definitely partially driven by the fear that people might actually use it.
Governments mining themselves would be some sort of last resort action. If they lost control over their currency anyway, they could at least try to profit off the transactions, and not give all power over the protocol to someone else.
However it would not be that much of a threat. First off, besides governments competing so no one can start a 51% attack, they'd also still be in competition with private mining operations. Since those can be anywhere out of their jurisdiction, they would have no advantage over any other miner.

So many assumptions.
If signalling for a specific version reaches 75%, and then miners communicate a date when it could activate, it could a very smooth transition.
No confusion, no panic.
And the claim of 2 chains does not make sense: If there is a fork, one chain might have 75% and the other 25% of hashpower.
The one with 25% would suddenly have 4x slower confirmation times until the next difficulty change, and would be nearly unusable. In Ethereum the difficulty adapts much faster (every minute?), while in Bitcoin it would take a long time.

Proof of work has always been used to decide consensus parameters. There just haven't been any controversial rule changes put to a vote yet.
As long as the changes are uncontroversial miners and nodes just wave it through. But as you can see with the controversial changes (BU/SegWit), miners are actively voting on them.
If the rules aren't up to CPU vote, then you tell me what happens if a supermajority of miners and nodes decide to run software with different consensus rule from Core? Sounds like a vote on the rules to me.
Also, that is exactly Satoshi's vision, quote:

I don't agree that we need fees to overtake the mining reward ("inflation") just yet. 
I always assumed it would happen when the block rewards run out, by which point there'd be hundreds of millions of users making more than up for rewards through sheer transaction volume.
At 12.5 BTC per block miners still get a good subsidy, so they should be more interested in the longterm to stay profitable, and forcing fee auctions now just hinders adoption and lessens the value because all uses that require low fees become expensive and/or unreliable.

And you know that because...? Can you see into the future?
Until recently, the theory was always that in the event of a fork, one branch would die off quickly due to incredibly slow confirmation times, and everyone migrating to the "winning" chain.
I don't buy all this talk of two equal coins, there will be quite a swift decision.
And about losing value, I see it just the opposite way: a successful fork will only increase trust in Bitcoin, as it will be shown that it can scale, that it does "route around damage", and that it can not be controlled by some people pretending to be leaders.
Also cheap transactions are instantly reinstated, and the user experience is instantly improved again.
All of this will send the price soaring (after some initial uncertainty).

While BU could fork with 60% hashpower and 1% of nodes, but it would be too risky for the miners, so they won't do it.
It is much more likely that the miners wait until BU has a supermajority of mining power, then commuincate a future date at which they might start producing bigger blocks. 
The miners won't just fork at 60%, they have too much invested in Bitcoin to do anything rash.

Bitcoin is *built* on putting your own greed first.
There is no right or wrong or some moral obligation to "put the wellbeing of the network above your greed".
Miners mainly care about making money, but luckily that's also the incentive to make Bitcoin a good system. Only a good system running smoothly makes them money.
So greed is the incentive. Miners will only agree to any change if it potentially makes them more money in the future.
So apparently neither BU nor Segwit seem to be particularly enticing to F2Pool and others.

Consensus in Bitcoin means "Nakamoto Consensus".


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
That's the only consensus that counts.
Proof of Work decides what is valid and what is not, and it has always been this way. It's just that before segwit and BU there have been no really controversial changes, and the miners never needed to decide anything.
But if a majority of miners decides to run a software with radically different rules, then that becomes the new consensus. 
And there's nothing you could do about it, except using a different network. 
But of course the miners want to make money, so they probably won't make any rash decisions that would lose them customers. As we can in the ongoing drawn-out hashrate voting/battle.

It would make much more sense to let miners and nodes decide which transactions they regard as "spam" and which they want to relay/mine. 
With enough capacity miners could decide that the "spam" is worth mining, and if they do, an attacker would run out of funds a lot faster. While users would probably not even notice the attack.

Maybe I didn't emphasize enough that it's important to hold your private keys yourself and not on an exchange if you care about having coins on both chains. 
If you only care about the majority chain anyway, the exchange will probably go with the majority and you will have to do nothing. But you might not get credited on the minority chain, should one exist.
Should a fork happen it will also probably be widely publicised even before the actual event, so can either just hold through until there is a clear winner (be it BU,Core or something else) without much risk (...besides the usual ones), or sell if it seems too risky for you.

2MB obviously won't be enough forever, but it keeps the network running as usual until we can scale further.
And 20MB blocks, 8MB blocks, 2-4-8MB blocks, planned scaling and dynamic scaling have all been rejected, so 2MB it is.
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:29:16

If you have your own private keys to your bitcoins, then they will be on both sides of the fork. After the fork one chain should die quickly, and you wouldn't have to choose.
Should both survive, you'll probably also be able to spend both on each chain, altough you'd probably have to use different software for each chain.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:38:37

As far as I am aware everything worked alright before the PBoC intervened. 
And there's no reason to believe that anything has changed.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:10:29
I don't see how that would work.
Step by step:
- 80% of miners signal BU, blocks are still 1MB
- Someone creates a 2 MB block, several other 2MB blocks follow
- After a few blocks 50% of miners switch back to Core and continue the Core-chain
- After a short time the core-chain surpasses the BU-chain again, all BU-blocks are orphaned
- This causes a reorg of the BU-chain, everyone who mined it loses their rewards, everyone is back on the Core-chain and mining 1MB blocks
What would anyone gain from this? 
If those 50% of miners are against BU, why would they mine on top of 2MB blocks in the first place? They only risk losing money, and the BU miners won't leave, they'll simply come back to the Core-chain.
This strategy makes neither economic sense, nor would it have any lasting effect.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:01:31
I did. The concept is that nodes start rejecting blocks and continue the chain with only their rules.
So a bunch of nodes are suddenly on their own chain.
For that to work, they also need miners to mine their chain.
But how are miners supposed to know how many "real" nodes are on the new chain? 
There is no way for them to know except counting nodes.
It's an absurd idea, but of course I fully support the right of anyone to fork him/herself off the network.

With a miner hardfork you know in advance which chain has the most hashpower behind them at the time of the fork.
USAF is nodes forking themselves off the network, with an unknown number of miners maybe following them.
If some miners do follow and both them and nodes start rejecting blocks, you're pretty much guaranteed to end up with two chains.
Because with this "USAF" you can't possibly know beforehand which chain is going to be the "right" one and how much hashpower will go there.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:30:58


They don't. Miners will bend over backwards to avoid any disruption to their otherwise perfectly predictable income stream. That's also why the fear of hardforking is overblown.
They will only activate any specific feature once it's clear they have both the majority hash power and most users behind them. And even then they'll announce the fork way in advance and give everyone time to upgrade.

Let the miners decide. They are the only ones who know which transactions (and fees) are profitable to them, and which ones are spam.

Don't expect to run anything else on it though.

Yes, the verification is very slow.
Fast enough for keeping up, but for initial sync you better use a different machine, and then just copy the data.

A "full" node has the whole blockchain and can look up transactions and balances locally, while a "light" or "SPV" node needs to connect to a full node to look up balances and transactions, as they do not have a copy of the blockchain.
Furthermore, a full node checks all transactions on the network for correctness. With an SPV node you need to trust that the node you connect to is giving you correct data.
Main reasons to run a node are altruism, paranoia (check balances privately), security (if you have 1000s of addresses you need to watch, and don't trust anyone else to do it).
For most normal people there is no reason to run a full node, the light ones (breadwallet, mycellium, electrum, multibit) all work very well and are a much easier to use.

There's a good chance of it happening, as all of the supporters of the NYA still stand behind it.
And it's quite a list of hashpower and businesses:
Despite what people here say, there's a good chance that it will go through, especially after Cash has shown that forking actually works, and is even safer with the amount of hashpower behind the NYA.
And a lot of people here deny it, but hashpower does matter.
They all want to be done with it and nobody likes uncertainty or instability, so there's a good chance that Segwit2x will be chosen as the path of least resistance.
I fully expect the anti-2x crowd to come out in full force again before 2x activates, and they will probably try to split to a segwit-only chain.
However, as soon as 2x activates I would expect both Cash and segwit-only to become insignificant.

Theoretically it should be cross compatible.
I tried it once with a FAT32 usb stick. Synced on OSX, then moved to the pi. 
It worked, but the stick got corrupted a few weeks later on the Pi for some reason. Maybe it did not cope well with a loss of power or something. So YMMV.
The second time I formatted the stick to ext4 and synced on Ubuntu, then moved to the Pi. This one has been running without problems.

No, it's Bitcoin working as intended.
There's obviously a difference in opinion about the different chains.
Users express this through holding/selling their favorite coin, thereby assigning value to it.
Miners react by mining the most profitable one.
Over time, the "best" coin will be the most valuable, while the other becomes irrelevant. It just takes time.
It's not a tragedy of the commons, no resource is being depleted or spoiled, it's just a conflict being resolved through the market.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:49:15
I still believe it's an okay compromise, at least it seems like a way to move forward at all.
I wonder how many see it this way too. I'd have preferred Unlimited + SegWit later, but since that isn't happening SegWit2x looks like the next best thing.
But who cares?
Worst case there is yet another fork, and the market will sort it out.
No more twitter reposting, no more character assassination, no more FUD. Just people voting with their money.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:51:53
Breadwallet has been extremely reliable so far.
They always stated they will keep user funds safe, and handled the Cash fork really well. So there's good reason to believe they will handle the s1x/s2x fork just fine as well.
Supporting something out of ideological reasons before the market has even voted on it is not a good business decision.

I don't know how many users want 2x, it is impossible to know.
My argument is that you don't even have to worry about "contentious forks" any more.
Everyone gets coins on both sides, and through the exchange market it will become apparent which fork has the the highest user demand. Since it is not really possible to measure user demand for contentious changes before a fork, maybe letting the market decide after each fork is the most effective way to handle it.

I agree, the only drawback is that it seems impossible to reliably determine what the "economic majority" wants before a fork.

One where everyone is free to do what they think is best.
You don't like 2x? No problem.
Just wait until it forks again into 1x and 2x, keep using only your preferred coin, and sell all others.
If everyone does the same, just doing what they believe is best for them, it should ultimately lead to a convergence on one chain that would acquire/retain a majority of users, miners and businesses.
While Cash gets a lot of hate, it has at least proven that it is absolutely possible to fork and just let the market handle it.

Bitcoin is valuable because it has the properties of good money and excels in storability and transportability, among others.
That's the value. You disagree?
And a Blockchain without mining *is* just a very inefficient database.
The whole point of the blockchain is immutability, which is provided through the accumulated proof of work by the miners.
If a company creates their own "blockchain" without mining, then the whole immutability part is gone, and you're left with a very slow replicated database.
If you keep mining, but your blockchain does not pay out tokens that any miner or user actually wants, then this mining security is also worth nothing.
"Being Money" is still the top application of blockchains, beyond that the hype will die for all spinoffs that do not have public mining and freely available tokens that people want, or is at least tied to the security provided by a "real" blockchain.

As an occasional r/btc visitor I can assure you that you greatly overestimate our powers.
Yes, it is true that I am personally blocking SegWit every day by thinking really hard about it. And how it would be cleaner as a hard fork.
But since I don't mine, that's really all I can do.
The miners are the only ones "blocking" anything, and if we assume them to be rational then they probably have reasons for not activating SegWit.
I still assume most are simply very conservative about changing anything at all. We know the big miners are watching everything, and we know they want *some* capacity upgrade.
But since right now everything is going great for them, I'd assume they only change anything once they stand to lose money. But then it will happen very rapidly.

You skipped a step, there is no decentralized routing yet, and it is truly a hard challenge.
Don't get me wrong, although I want bigger blocks I'm also for SegWit and LN. 
I just don't think it is right to sell it as the definitive solution when this crucial part of routing is simply not yet working as advertised. And it really is a hard problem, people have been working on for years without a real solution.
And without decentralized routing there is a high chance of hubs centralizing, at least this is my fear which is similar to the small-block faction fearing that bigger blocks would lead to nodes in datacenters.
So while obviously a lot of LN code exists, I see it as wrong to advertise LN as the ultimate solution when there are clearly crucial parts missing.
@_date: 2016-12-17 01:38:19
That's my main disappointment as well.
By now even The Guardian is writing about how [Venezuelans are using Bitcoin]( to get by, so there must be at least some truth to it.
But 15ct per transaction in a country where the monthly salary is [about 20$]( clearly impairs its widespread use as an alternative currency.
I used to be excited about Bitcoin helping people in this exact situation. But with the current fee "market" the impact is quite limited.
@_date: 2016-11-14 10:29:27

But "getting the ball rolling" with centralized routing sounds like more centralization, not less.
And lightning hubs do get fees, but why would it lead to decentralization? 
The most successful hubs are the ones with the fastest connections and the most direct existing channels. They will  be the ones offering the lowest fees, because well-connected hubs will have the shortest and cheapest payment routes.
This sounds suspiciously like it will lead to several big hubs connecting everything else.

@_date: 2016-12-06 12:55:32
Not really. 
To protect your LN payment channels from fraud you have to watch them constantly. So you have to be either permanently online (unlike Bitcoin) or let your channel be managed by a 3rd party (unlike Bitcoin)
LN might be a great payment network, but it is not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-13 03:02:57
Could you maybe stop the insults and be more civilized?
I run a node and understand quite well how it works.
Yes, full nodes verify transactions. But I don't need to run my own node to ensure that someone can't take my coins.
With LN coins are locked in a channel, and if someone tries to defraud me by broadcasting an older channel state, it has to be countered by me through broadcasting the "breach remedy transaction".
Failing to do that will result in my coins in the channel being stolen, so the channel has to be watched 24/7. 
My bitcoins on the other hand are quite safe, even when I'm not watching them at all.

How exactly is routing "solved"?
Are you talking about the "80% chance to find a route"-solved?

Volatility has been decreasing since the beginning, and keeps going down the more people use it.


They also exchange their visa and paypal
back to cash. Every merchant accepting it increases confidence that someone will accept it as payment, which increases confidence that someone will still do the same tomorrow.


This one is debatable. Current mainstream economics says it needs to be inflationary, to make people spend and invest. 
But our world is already deflationary, every technology just keeps improving and getting cheaper. 
And there will always be things worth investing in, if they promise the chance of a higher return than just holding coins.
Besides there's also "time preference", even if my coins are worth more tomorrow, I still need food and new tools for my work today.

Bitcoin Core sells LN as the *only* scaling solution, which some people like Bitcoin Cash supporters disagree with.

I'd say yes, it does reduce the reward for miners.
But another answer you hear often in this subreddit is that miners will actually make more money. With the reasoning that altough they'll only process settlement transactions (closing/opening lightning channels), those few transactions will be expensive. 
So lightning fees should be low because it does not require mining, and running a lightning node should be cheap. But opening/closing channels might be expensive.
Unfortunately I have not yet seen any numbers or simulation for either argument.

It‘s not about „Satoshi‘s Vision“, it‘s that I believed Bitcoin to be a nearly „perfect money“.
Anything can be money if it is:
- Divisible: Can be divided into smaller units of value.
- Fungible: One unit is viewed as interchangeable with another.
- Portable: Individuals can carry money with them and transfer it to others.
- Durable: An item must be able to withstand being used repeatedly.
- Acceptable: Everyone must be able to use the money for transactions.
- Uniform: All versions of the same denomination must have the same purchasing power.
- Limited in Supply: The supply of money in circulation ensures values remain relatively constant.
Bitcoin used to fulfill all these requirements perfectly,
but „Portability“ has been less than perfect several times now.

That‘s probably the point of running them on AWS.
High speed and connectivity all around the world.
If I ran a business that relied on verifying incoming payments from all around the world, I‘d also prefer to have nodes in different locations rather than just one.
AWS makes that easy, you basically just check a box for each continent/region you want to deploy your nodes in.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:35:32
What‘s the problem though? 
According to nearly every no2x proponent, 
users will value the „pure“ chain more.
As we have seen, miners will follow the value, so if „1x“ remains the most valuable then the miners will return to it, and most accumulated difficulty will stay with 1x.
And then Blockchain will continue to call the unchanged 1x chain „BTC“.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:39:28
Really? Their postion is basically neutral.
If you believe users (and nodes) are in charge, and users will value 1x more, then miners will follow that value with their hashrate, no matter what they previously said.
bc.i is just saying that they will accept what the majority chooses, hashrate and difficulty are just a product of user valuation.

That's a slightly different problem, that currently sending/receiving tx and blocks introduces a delay which makes this behaviour profitable. I'm still optimistic miners can be incentivized to include transactions through optimizations like [IBLT.](

Wow you‘re easy to convince.
Holding both coins until it is resolved remains the safest option, as it eliminates the risk of being wrong.
Only if you are ideologically invested should you sell one or the other, but even then holding both remains safer.
Because no matter which chain wins, the „winning“ one will be the most valuable, so even if you dislike the outcome, at least you won‘t have lost money.
Worst case you end up with „less profit“ than if you sell one side earlier.

That would be great. Unfortunately it's unclear if there is an alternative to "Proof of Work" that provides the same security and immutability, but requires less energy.
If Proof of Work remains the best way to secure a blockchain then energy consumption will always rise and fall with the current mining profitability.
In this case we can only hope that competition between miners will eventually drive all of them to renewable energy sources. Otherwise we're (even more) screwed.
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:43:21
What's your opinion on how to work it out?
I would of course prefer the highest possible tx capacity while also having a fee market sufficient to secure the network. Especially when block rewards end.
If we can't have both, there must still be a better way than a blocksize limit way below demand.
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:21:05
Thank you so much for your explanation, I read a paper about it, but you explained it a lot better.
So, would fees necessarily go all the way to zero?
This paper I read about it (  ) says it would, and the fix would be either fixed fees or fixed blocksizes. The reason being what you explained.
At least I finally understand where the small blockers are coming from.
Ok so right now we have fixed fees and fixed blocksize, couldn't this be made to work with fixed fees only? 
I'm starting to understand the difficulties, but I have a hard time believing that big blocks would crash the network because noone would pay any fees.

Yes, this is the point I'm having difficulties with. Would it really necessarily go to zero?
I understand the opposing view that it is of course in my rational interest to pay no fee at all. So what's the current mechanic that makes tx with fee go through faster than without? Apparently miners already chose to include tx with any fee over feeless, something that wouldn't change even with bigger blocks.

But this paternalistic view is a big part of the disconnect between camps.
Telling people they're wrong and you will explain what they really want does not work.
You've explained, people disagree. End of story.
It's painfully obvious that not all people agree with the Core path, and that won't change. Likewise, not all agree with BU.
If Core wanted to win the hearts and minds of everyone again, one possibility would be a clear commitment to introducing base-space scaling at in the future. AFAIK we need more space just for opening/closing LN channels anyway.
Ideally with increasing to 2 MB shortly after segwit, to show it can be done.  It would instantly get more miners on board, and shut up at least half of rbtc. [edit: I know SW is an increase, but we all know we are talking about "classic" blockspace increase]
I know Core does not want that, so we get a stalemate and alternative clients. XT,Classic,BU... it will continue until someone finds the compromise that might work. 
One side saying "we are already compromising!", the other "we will not settle for compromises any longer!" shows there clearly is no compromise yet, so one is needed if both sides wanted to join forces again.
[edit2: I know you say it would take months. So start now. Time does not matter anymore, we're in a stalemate anyway. If Core said "we're preparing a 2MB HF, it will be coded, tested and deployed within 12 months by us, the Core team" this would likely remove a lot of opposition to Core. And I say that as a BU supporter.]

You're good, with breadwallet you control your own keys, and therefore get all coins on all forks.
The difficulty might be getting them out seperately, but at the last split breadwallet provided an option to withdraw just one side, and it worked well.

After the fork wait a while (and read the news) before making any transactions, and you should be safe.

The safest and easiest way to get through it is to hold your keys yourself, on paper or an SPV wallet like breadwallet.
This way you will get coins on all chains and have guaranteed access to all of them.
Storing them on an exchange is never a good idea.
If you want to trade the fork, you of course either have to store them on an exchange, or send them there after the fork, which might be slightly more difficult. So far Bitfinex are the only ones who said they will support both chains if both survive.
But the safest and easiest way is really to hold your own keys and just wait it out.

Just keep holding through it.
If you keep your keys yourself, like in breadwallet, you will get coins on every chain. If you keep them on an exchange you are subject to their decision what happens with your coins.
Ultimately one coin will emerge as the winner, and after that you can continue normally. Worst-case you'll have to install an update to your wallet.

Don't worry, all will be well.
The easiest way to get through all this is to do nothing.
Although if you feel competent enough you should withdraw your coins to your own wallet, like breadwallet or electrum, because coins are only truly yours if you keep them on your own devices.
Either way, some time after the fork a winner will emerge, and coinbase as well as the wallets will follow the winner. 
So as long as you just care about being on the side of the majority, you don't have to do anything at all.

There is an ongoing discussion about how to scale Bitcoin to enable higher transaction capacity.
It has been debated for years, and currently one group comprised of a majority of miners as well as several businesses want to push a Bitcoin version called "SegWit2x", which is like current Bitcoin, but with twice the base capacity.
 
A different group, which includes several prominent developers of the de facto standard "Bitcoin Core" version, rejects SegWit2X on the grounds that it would presumably hurt decentralization and goes against their and their users interest.
Both sides are claiming to represent the "economic majority", both want to keep the "Bitcoin" name, and both refuse to back down.
This might lead to another fork and two different versions of the current Bitcoin blockchain.
The fate of each will be decided by people holding or selling coins on one fork or the other, and ultimately one coin should emerge as the most valuable, and therefore "winner".
If you hold Bitcoin and don't know what to do, just keep your private keys and sit it out. If Bitcoin splits in two, your balance also splits, so you'll have coins on all sides of the fork. After that you can wait and let others battle it out, then just continue normally after it is resolved.

You have a good discussion in:
Basically, ECDSA is compromised, hashing isn't. With a quantum computer, you could easily deduce the private key corresponding to a public key. If you only have an address, which is a hashed public key, the private key is safe. Anyway, to spend a transaction, you need to send the public key. At that point you are vulnerable, but the attack is not straightforward.
In general, quantum computers are not exponentially better than classical computers. You cannot access all the states in the superposition, only global properties. You can read  to get a good idea of what they can and cannot do.

breadwallet is pretty safe, since your keys are encrypted and the iOS/Android phones it runs on are relatively safe. As long as you did not unlock/root them, I'd say they are slightly more secure than your average desktop computer.
Also, breadwallet gives you a recovery code to write down on paper in case your phone is ever lost, so it's pretty foolproof.
Electrum is also good, but only as secure as the machine it runs on.

@_date: 2017-10-07 17:37:16
That is correct, all coins that existed before existed on both chains afterwards.
This time might ultimately be different though. Both possible chains strive to be "true bitcoin", but neither chain currently has a new difficulty adjustment.
So if one chain is starved of hashpower, transactions on it would be incredibly slow until the difficulty adjusts. As demonstrated by cash. The starving chain might die unless they implement emergency changes so they can survive without hashpower.
This means either segwit2x could come into existence, but vanish just as quickly if the market does not value it. Likewise, the current chain might be abandoned.
However, I suspect that there will be two coins as soon as one side is seen as "losing" and has to take emergency action to make their chain distinct from the other before being wiped out.

@_date: 2017-05-10 13:06:54
I'd recommend just waiting it out.
It's possible to import the seed into another wallet and try to doublespend it with a higher fee, but that is quite annoying in itself as the seed recovery differs slightly between many wallets, and has the added risk of exposing your keys to another software and/or machine.
Core nodes since v0.12. drop unconfirmed TX after 72 hours, so there's a good chance it will be confirmed or dropped within that timeframe.
I've also imported from paper to breadwallet with low fee in times of network congestion, both times they cleared within 2 days.

Most of the alternatives feel clunky by comparison, and bread is still the only true SPV wallet as far as I know.
"bitwallet" supports segwit if that's what you're after, but the interface is not recommended for beginners. Also the "change"-behaviour was not very good the last time I used it, it kept reusing addresses, and was missing the ability to calculate the fee if you just want to "send all". I spent quite some time calculating the spendable amount just to empty one key and not leave any dust.
some people have recommended greenaddress, but their security mechanism is also not recommended for beginners.

Miner's are not stupid and above all don't want to lose money, so they'll coordinate any possible fork to minimize risk.
Here's an explanation how this might work:

The unbanked can run nodes, but are supposed to pay 1USD per transaction.

@_date: 2017-05-24 15:35:59
I know about the disagreements, I'm just saying that the chance of "uasf" being supported by miners or major businesses seem even lower than before.
Many participants value stability, and are therefore against ANY kind of fork, even if uncontroversial.
uasf is about the most unpredictable proposal so far, so I doubt it will get any meaningful support.
But don't let that deter you, I fully support everyone running the software they think is best.

You can't simply give your address to someone and be done with it. 
First you have to establish a route and channel between participants, and that part is not fully solved yet.
AFAIK right now it would be usable either through centralized directories of participants and their open channels, or through the experimental automatic discovery that works like 80% of the time.
In the Bitcoin base layer it works because every transaction is broadcast to every node, whereas LN requires you to establish a new channel or discover an existing one.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:55:31
Yes it is documented, it's based on BIP32, BIP39 and BIP44. Most modern wallets *should* be compatible.

They are one of the oldest exchanges still operating, so that's good.

They require little information to create an account, but there have been stories over the years that some users got their withdrawals singled out for closer inspection and went to KYC hell. Should this happen to you you better speak russian.

Last time I checked everyone was free to use any software they like. There is no "attack", no "firing developers", there can't be a "coup" as that would require rulers to overthrow.
Just people using and supporting their favorite software.
You like calling classic failed and dead, in reality it's just the currently strongest alternative implementation.
Right now most people are with Core. However, should Core at some point "fail" or not have the features a majority requests, then it is good to have different implementations ready to be switched on instantly.
Don't you agree?
Or, more directly: most people are probably in "wait and see"-mode about scaling. Many hope that Core delivers and their plan will work out. If it doesn't, Classic/XT/Unlimited are still just a download away.

Most people don't have any interest in running a full node.
My mom surely doesn't.
To businesses it's gonna be just another item on the bill, just like webhosting and tax accountants.
And the enthusiasts on this sub probably already have the machines to support larger blocks. My node is running smoothly on an RPi2, but should the requirements rise then a cheap Intel NUC would easily be enough to handle it for the foreseeable future.
There's also a good chance that with higher utility and more users the number of full nodes would actually rise.

Trezor and most other modern wallets give you a list of seed words from which all keys are derived.
I believe Trezor makes you write them down on paper as well, and enter them again to check.
My own "solutions" are:
- created wallet with password encryption from  and printed that out, stored multiple copies at multiple locations.
- created wallet in breadwallet, stored money, deleted wallet, stored recovery words (ink on paper) in multiple locations. The nice thing is that it's just words, which can be made to look less like a wallet.
I also have the main wallet seed words memorized. 
And for paranoias sake I wrote down only a decoy of the seed words, slightly different from the real wallet.
I know the difference when I read it, but should someone steal it they'll just recover the decoy with only a few bucks in it.

And how can demand be fake? Every seller needs a buyer, otherwise nothing would happen at all.
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:03:38
It does.
Even if the recipient already has an open channel, you still need a third party to find a route to connect to this channel.
And to keep LN channels safe, the channel needs to be watched constantly so you can start countermeasures in case someone tries to steal from you. 
So you'd either have to be online 24/7, or outsource the monitoring to a third party.

Why does UASF matter so much to you if you're getting segwit either way?
@_date: 2016-05-22 20:53:51
Even if blocksize was unlimited, miners could always make them as small as they wanted to. Every miner could set it to the size they are comfortable with, and decide for themselves which transactions are "spam" and which they want to include.
And the cost of filling blocks as an attack rises linearly with blocksize. You want to fill 8MB blocks with transactions, you'll need 8x more transactions than you'd need for filling 1MB. To make sure the attack works, you'll have to pay a fee for each transaction, which would then cost you 8 times more than filling a 1MB block.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:28:10

@_date: 2016-05-31 16:41:27
Xthin does lower bandwidth for regular nodes.
Since one argument against higher blocksizes is "everyone needs to be able to run a node, and bandwidth is expensive", Xthin is a very good improvement.

@_date: 2017-05-12 09:17:42
That makes little sense.
As we see miners are incredibly cautious about any change at all.
The want to avoid any service disruption that would cost them money, so even with lots of different signals for eb/ad they would only fork after there is a clear majority for any specific value, and would announce a switch months in advance.

Fiat means (loosely translated) "by decree", it has nothing do with trust.
The government says "this is money", which makes many people trust it, but it's not in the name.
You're right that it has only value due to demand.
It has demand as money because it has all of the characteristics of good money, and most of those can be better than the properties of fiat money.
Yes, anyone can create new currencies now.
However, the theory is that over time there should always be convergence towards a single currency.
If money is a network, like telephones,
then the value of the network rises with the number of participants.
Like with telephones, your network is more useful and more valuable to everyone the more people you can interact with.
If you are on a different network than your friends or business partners and can't interact with them, it is less useful and valuable to you.
Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage, is the best-known "Brand", has survived many problems, and has the highest computational security through mining. Therefore it still has the highest amount of trust. It will survive in some form as long as people see value in it.
Fiat money is no competitor, only better cryptocurrencies could dethrone Bitcoin.
All the current contenders however still have their specific problems, so despite the hype about other currencies, Bitcoin will survive in some form.
The reason is the relative "stability" of Bitcoin, due to its resilience so far. And for better or worse, it's also quite resistant to change as we can see.
But this also counts as "stability". 
Bitcoin can only be made obsolete through a better currency, but as soon as some other currency is seen as a real threat, the network will react to it quite rapidly. 
This has not happened so far despite high fees and low capacity, because other currencies are still not collectively seen as a threat.

I does make a difference. 
It would show that hard forks are nothing to be feared as long as they are well coordinated and executed.
Furthermore, it would demonstrate that is indeed possible to find a compromise and move forward, which would in my opinion show that Bitcoin is still able to overcome any obstacle.
We'll also see how well the network copes with a higher load.
And should the blockchain ever need to be modified again, it is good to already have data and procedures in place to improve the process.

Those quotes are a lot older than Classic itself, and no proof for your statements.
The 2MB proposal started after Core refused to implement anything higher, and when it became clear Core refused even their own 2MB proposal.
So no, Classic never refused 2MB blocks, you managed to completely misrepresent it.
And Gavin saying "I wonder..." is not the same as Classic being a "dictatorship". Classic wants to do some kind of voting system, which has its own problems, but that's not a dictatorship.
You can check traction of all clients on nodecounter.com , currently 25% of nodes and 5-6% of hashrate support Classic. 
It's an ongoing vote until January 2018, so maybe you should hold off celebrating until then.

There really is nothing to worry about, if this bet is any indicator:

tl;dr some people are unhappy and want to force segwit activation. 
just sit on your coins/private keys, do nothing, and wait what happens.
should anything happen at all, you're protected by not moving coins as long as there's uncertainty

Wow weird comments.
Good luck with that uasf.

Well he does share a company with several high-profile and influential Core contributors, creating products based on their expertise.
It does not make him directly involved, but saying that he does not have anything to do with Core also doesn't sound quite right.

There's nothing to be afraid of.
On August 1st I'll just sit on my keys, make no transactions, and wait for a conclusion.
Even if a split occurs, then as long as I have my keys those coins will be valid on either chain, or both.
[edit: What you call "replay attack" is actually expected bitcoin behaviour to enforce convergence on a single ledger. A "replay attack" would relay every transaction on all chains. People would very quickly agree on one chain for all activity, and the other chain would die.
This makes sense if you believe it's preferable to have one definitive ledger (and money network) rather than several segments.]

You misspelt "absurd"

It's true, it's not backed by anything.
Just like any other money it is only "backed" by the faith of its users that it will still be worth something tomorrow.
Bitcoin could have this faith, because it has characteristics that good money should have, like fungibility, durability, recognizability and transportability among others.
Based on those characteristics it could theoretically be a better money than any existing one.

Ink on paper is quite durable and safe from hackers.
To avoid losing it in a fire I simply store several password-protected keys at several locations.
Best digital medium would be a trezor, but even that gives you a list of recovery words you need to store securely.

What exactly are your credentials?
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:32:40
To you maybe, but not to most normal people.
Give someone without prior knowledge of bitcoin the task of sending money to someone across the world. Walking into a Western Union and handing them cash is a lot easier than acquiring and using Bitcoin.

Can anyone please repost the ad? I can't find it

As I understand they "solved" replay attacks through splitting balances into different keys on each new chain. This is not directly possible with Bitcoin.
They are still battling it out, it just takes much longer.

Most secure would be a hardware wallet like trezor.
For convenience and security, breadwallet on iOS and Android is very good.

UASF is more like continously slapping yourself while asking "why are you hitting yourself?".
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:15:30
shows "only" 27.8% for the last 144 blocks as of this post, but it's still a lot already.

because nearly all altcoins offer nothing over the first original implementation.
meaning anything they do, bitcoin already does. "faster" does not count, as correctly set up 0-confirmations are fine for bitcoin, and the security of 1h of confirmations needs 1h for all altcoins as well.
only exception is Namecoin because it is more technology than currency.

So far I fail to see any "distinguishing features" other than inflation and faster blocktime.
Yes, they might be a good test for new features, but so far there are none. 
Namecoin is coming along sluggishly, but the main feature is secure storage of information paired to a private key.
This info could be DNS entries, document hashes, contact data, login information. This could become a very useful tool, but I would not expect it to take off anytime soon.
