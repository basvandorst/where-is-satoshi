Gemini is great.  I mean if you have the IQ of a carrot or higher you can figure out Gemini in &lt; 3 minutes
Yes Coinbase is for literal retard IQ.  But come on look at the risk you’re taking with them

He made hundreds of billions of dollars for George Soros and executed 600,000 trades through multiple recessions.  They guy might know something.  But maybe he just got lucky like you say.

And now it’s up back to what you invested.  Can someone post again a reply in a week?
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:55:36
Yes I said that.  It’s also for retards that want to fork over shit loads of fees and deal with a corrupt ceo who shills BCH (just had to wait 6 hours for 15 confirmations lol) as much as possible.

When a reason is assigned AFTER an event that’s how you know it’s not the real reason 
I remember when market futures were down 20% on Trump winning and Paul Krugman had already published an end of the world article about how the market hated Trump and it would never recover.
Then we woke up and the market zoomed up every week even until this week.
Just stop with the fake reasons and need to have to explain random when sometimes random is the only answer.

Bingo.  If the exchanges and general population can beef up on security we have something that could last for centuries.  This precisely fits anti fragiles narrative.
It’s taking a massive beating from everyone and still standing on 2 legs

1 trillion market cap is 1/7th gold.
1 trillion market cap is ~ 50k bitcoin. (250B = 15k BTC in early 2018)
You don’t think it can get to 2/7 of gold?

I’m investing in this so called gold

Calm down Pajeet.
India doesn’t have 0.0000001% the middle class lifestyle we have here.  Just because we have an occasional beggar that won’t go hungry if he shows up for his daily buffet at the shelter doesn’t mean we have the problem India has

Good point, if bitcoin isn’t up 30% literally every single day we better keep all our money in a system that prints trillions every year and can close your account or confiscate all of your money on a whim.
While we’re at it let’s put all the power to control our currency we use on a daily basis in the power of 12 families with no audit or oversight.  And we will call it the ‘Fed’ so nobody cares and thinks it’s an official government body. 
Then we can pretend it’s all backed by physical gold we will be compensated with in the event of a collapse.
Sounds like the perfect reason to stay in FIAT if crypto isn’t getting me a new shiny lambo literally every single day

He is.  His books have a major theme where compiling shitloads of top heavy mega structures (govts/corps) result in massive collapse and destabilizing of the environment because of black swan events 
He preaches localized level of governance and decision making because people and cultures are so different.  You can’t make everyone act the same or pretend that Walmart makes us all happy and serves up high quality content.  It’s all cheap lowest common denominator bullshit and a packed clown house full of underpaid handicaps.  But go ahead and defend it now!  Lol
