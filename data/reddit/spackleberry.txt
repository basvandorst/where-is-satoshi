No, *demand* is the only requirement for currency to work. How that demand is driven can vary. If the currency is backed by something, like gold, then the value of the currency is driven by demand for gold. If it's fiat, then it's driven by the fact that people need it to pay taxes.
But Bitcoin isn't backed by anything, I don't need it to pay my taxes, and I can't pay my bills with it. Why should I want it?

What happened to McDuck Enterprises? Doesn't Scrooge (Dagobert) own a large corporation and assets other than the cash in his money bin? Doesn't he have bank accounts?

An example of a poorly-managed fiat monetary system doesn't refute anything. It's like saying that because the Ford Pinto was a lousy car that we should all ride horses instead.

From the Fed itself. From the Federal Reserve's statutory power to create money. Somebody at one of the Federal Reserve banks puts numbers into a computer and credits the account of one of its member banks, and the bank or whoever transfers their assets, mainly US treasuries, to the Fed.

You don't have to believe in fiat currency for it to work. Fiat currency has value because the government levies taxes, and you can only pay your taxes in money the government creates via spending.

Fractional reserve banking is an outdated concept because banks don't lend out their reserves. They create money by lending and then find the reserves that they need after the fact. A bank lends you $10,000 by depositing $10,000 into your account and adding your debt as an asset on their own balance sheet.
