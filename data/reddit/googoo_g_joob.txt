Right- becoming independently finnacialy independently is important. It is freedom and fuel for doing whatever it is that you want to do.  That opens the door to maximizing the flourishing for you and anyone else you include in your life. :)

US public debt is now &gt;100% GDP. Should I be worried? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:33:10
THIS. It is a protip, never leave working until you are sure you have made it, like the money is in your hand. Keep at least 5% of the coins you had to hedge vs. Fiat is my suggestion. Good luck!

Cheap Chinese Bitcoin rip-off that will not be relevant decades in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:11:58


Lol, this is nonsense by thirsty elite control freaks. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:00:27
Rat poison squared that is. 
Trading fetus brains is highly lucrative too I hear. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:35:01
Snap! What do I do? 
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:13:06
An article online said not to worry until 70 debt to GDP. A guy in college told me 100%. You tell me 120%. 
I really think we will reach that as politicians like to kick the can down the road in regards to necessary changes that would make their elections more difficult to win. 
We should do a U-turn, right?

We are mooning him! ������

What if a brother only has 5 years to live? Monnies have no use or value if I only accumulate and never spend. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 16:58:27
That would make it less stressing and simple and improve fintech adoption leading to economic efficiencies. Fuck it, let's do it. No tax for cryptocurrencies! 
@_date: 2018-10-01 03:51:26
At current prices, it would be worth the wait. 7% yearly is pretty average for stocks being a doubling every decade. To get to a new ATH Bitcoin would have to more than triple today's price. Of course most people don't have such patience. I am iron hands though, baby! 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:58:54
Both are in limited supply so deflation fundamental should hold true? Price naturally up over time? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:57:44
Nahhhh 1mil by 2020 EOY or John McAfee eats his dick. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:55:44
Buying and holding has been proven to be effective. Buy at the local (big) dips for even more effectiveness as you accrue capital to invest.

Is this a Netflix adaptation?

It's all a conspiracy, they are watching and the whales are manipulating and accumulating. This is the lesson of the video.

So does Snoop Dogg, and Willie Nelson and I like their music. Joe Rogan, and I like his comedy. Mike Lindell was a Coke addict for decades and crack for 9 years and I like his pillows. Some good people have used drugs.

They won't make it guys.

The boldest prediction I saw was 4 million per Bitcoin by 2030. Lol

Do the Winklevoss Twins HODL 1% of BTC? 
@_date: 2018-12-08 10:32:52
To the mooooooooon
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:16:10
Now is the most important time to HODL. You can never take a loss if you never sell, ahahaha.

Yes, a de minimas would be great for reducing accounting pains. So many small transactions can get made.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:31:30
