I promise that I searched both here and the actual ELI5 sub and didn't see anything; I knew I couldn't be the first person to ask this. I must have used the wrong keywords. Sorry.

That sounds circular. I get paid to process the transaction, but I can't get paid until that transaction is processed.
Or you pay me with traditional money, which undermines the usefulness of crypto.

Let's pretend that bitcoin settles on a value of around ~$12,000. Let's say all 21M bitcoins are mined. Now let's say that every single bitcoin gets purchased tomorrow by a Bank of America customer out of their checking account. What percent impact do you think that'd have on there books? 10% loss in total checking account balance? 20%?  Maybe even 25%? Not even close.
Bank of America would see less than a 3% dip in their deposit product assets.  If you want to look at all their assets (mortgages, auto loans, securities, investments, etc) it's closer to 1%.
Banks are about as scared of bitcoin as an aircraft carrier is of a wooden canoe.

Even if it settles on $120,000, it's still not enough to worry a single bank, let alone the entire industry.
Banks don't particularly care about the day to day transactions. In fact, between data upkeep, processing fees, etc. most demand accounts (ie checking accounts) *lose* money for the bank. That's why they try to recoup these costs with fees, ensuring minimal balances, etc.
Banks make money on loans, primarily on property, and on investments. 1. *If* a crypto comes along that actually threatens the industry in some way, they'll simply buy up the crypto. BoA has over a trillion dollars in assets. They're bigger than a lot of countries. 2. People are still going to need to borrow money for large purchases, and where do you think they're going to get that money from?
