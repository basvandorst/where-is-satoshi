Galloway talks a lot and delivers .. Rarely. Ignore.

My attempts to barter using chickens are failing. WTF?!

Yeah that was obviously (?) a metaphor, but when I first sorted out I was looking forward to bring able to use Bitcoin to buy "everyday" stuff. Just recently I got called out for suggesting that what I bought it for, rather than to just invest/HODL, but really I'd just like an alternative, universal (crypto)currency to use anyhow I want.

I *still* can't buy a coffee or a beer with mine - I don't feel the need to travel to the nearest conurbation to do so either.. I'm HODLing for now..

It'll be interesting to see if the UK Government will help a citizen in trouble.

I used to use a desktop calculator, but the batteries would never last long enough to complete a block. Then solar-powered versions came out, but evening would come far too soon...
Those were the days...

Pictures or it didn't happen ��

Unlikely. But we'll send one of our best-qualified people. Parliament's in recess so Amber Rudd will be free

Interesting .. So do I. Coffee, beer...

Wow! Just had one of these and marked it as spam.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:46:46
I'm surprised at that - would've thought they'd embrace it with open arms.

Pyongyang maybe? 
Mind you, the only reason I'm able to hang onto my little Bitcoin stash is that I can't find anywhere to spend it. I keep using it to donate to software authors though.

Thanks! It sounds like something interesting is coming up in a future version. Thanks for a great product!

I'm worried that the idiots in the alleged government are showing an interest in digital currency - they've screwed everything else up so far.

I've installed 2.2 and have a noob-ish question for you. I recorded the wallet address when I first set it up, and used the address as a "tip jar" link on my web site; is that the right/recommended way to do it?
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:37:29
Hmmm, maybe not with chickens, but ducks and pâté - that's another matter 
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:35:37
People will barter with chickens. You can raise (mine) your own, and unlike a blockchain there never seems to be any limit.
