You obviously didn't read or comprehend the comment to which you replied, because you're talking past its point.
I enjoy a good conspiracy theory, but I don't enjoy a conspiracy theorist who just froths and rambles without facts or understanding to give his claims any plausibility.

Because freedoms and liberties defend themselves, Mr. Paul?  Stop being a dumb ass Mr. Paul.  You obviously have no idea what good purposes that government can serve.

**Because there's infinite room in *publicly owned* easements for cables?  Because there's infinite room in *publicly owned* spectrum for signals?  Most people don't understand how the issue of regulation is often grounded in physical limits.  If there was vast opportunity for new ISPs to start up and offer customers their product, then we could let free market economics play out and people would vote with their wallets - but that's not reality.**
Either you simply don't understand the issues involved or you're trolling.
edit: Maybe bold will help, but I doubt it.
BTW, your account is 1 day old.  You calling others a shill is hilarious.
