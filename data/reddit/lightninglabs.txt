I won't elaborate but it certainly has the potential to be used in such manner as do all cryptocurrencies, it's the easiest way to move masses of wealth in minutes anywhere in the world.

Then why's it sitting at 6300..... Knowing about something and buying something are two different things unfortunately. Hopefully it's not known for the wrong reasons.

Didn't the Indian government ban banks from letting you deposit onto exchanges? Mind me asking how your buying it?

Same guy that started a mdpv thread on bluelight moved to a discreet island where he was attempting to turn a batch into a different color or some shit then returned back to the us only to be accused of murdering his neighbor think I'll let his opinion slide...

HODL, MIDGIT, HODL, DWARF. We have HODL we need a new word for short.

Your not going to make crypto returns on blue chip stocks. Less risky though when volatility is accounted for though. Why not do both?

Only worth trying if you used a weak password, all they'll do is brute force it. Cheaper to rent out a bitcoin ASICS and going to town with that on your wallet.

People underestimate how large a variable being able to scale globally is. I'm surprised it's slow introduction hasn't had more bearing on the price, it's cheaper, faster and even allows cross chain swaps.

So the hashrate will fall to adjust this, I don't see the issue.

Nazis had fucked up motives to say the least. I'm talking about a fair world government. Yeah war yields huge profits for certain countries, but it's rather messed up.

This is underrated information, this is massive for bitcoins future as a potential currency.

Zimbabwe dollars where the next best investment following cryptocurrencies, they went from being worthless to £50 a pop on ebay for the 100 trillion dollar ones.

We need a world government in order to establish a fair rule of law, trade deals ect. Isn't going to happen though for the simple reason that some countries are better off then others. Some are ruled by dictators corrupted by greed and some are just plainly fucked up places altogether. 
Brexit made me less patriotic I guess, finding out that the majority of the population voted because of a bus advertisement for the nhs or lack of knowledge on the subject.
