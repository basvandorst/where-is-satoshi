That 4.4GB number is for around a quarter million transactions per day,  and would definitely not suffice for a billion people.
Edit: It would work for a billion people if each person only made 1 transaction every 4000 days. (Every 11 years!)

You are wrong. There is nothing stopping us doing this right now. You are confusing "digital units" with the smallest possible fraction. A "digital unit" has no value unless we assign it value. Using your argument, we already have an infinite supply of bitcoins, which is not true. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:09:21
A "digital unit" is not the same as a unit of bitcoin. A set fraction of something is not a unit of something. Pennys are not dollar units, dollars are dollar units. 100 pennys units is equal in value to a dollar unit. Right now we could exchange  10^100 / 10^100 bitcoins, it would still be 1 bitcoin.

What you said is pointless. Wouldn't you agree that economics is driven by technicalities? A small nudge to a single constant and your system could go from stable to unstable. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:24:27
Let me help. The problem is in the definition of a unit. We are calling fractions of something "units". If you divide a satoshi by ten, you still have the same supply of satoshis but you now have another "unit" of which there are 10 times the amount of satoshis. If you redefine the satoshi to be that unit, then it's value will change to that of 1/10th of what a satoshi used to be. 
Edit: Okay I can tell that you're definitely not an idiot because for the most part you are right, the number doesn't matter. What does matters is what fraction of the whole each person has, and can get and can lose. If we double the number of bitcoins, then the fraction that everyone had before, is cut in half, unless doubling the amount of bitcoins means you give everyone twice as much as their current value.  It's all about control over a fraction of the total... I think most people envision that increasing the supply means they will have a reduced fraction of the total.

I used to do outreach for my engineering college. We would visit local high schools to promote science/engineering. Our biggest goal was to encourage high school girls to become engineers and it  seemed like what we were doing was really working because almost half of the freshmen enrolled were females. After the first two years though, the majority of women would drop out or change majors. It takes a very dedicated and passionate woman to finish engineering school. Same goes for men, but I think for guys there is just more pressure; even if they hate it, they are almost forced them to stick it out.
I totally agree with you about this though.  All I can think is... DUH!      Humans will shape the bitcoin economy and bitcoin will shape the human economy. It has nothing to do with gender.

I also bought a hard drive. Make sure you have the right shipping address! For some reason they cant change where it's sent it after buying with bitcoin. I had to drive 40 miles to pick it up.

Update: I set up a coinbase account and decided I'd just trade for enough to cover the amount i'll lose from my mined stash. Bought some tea, stickers, and hardware from tiger direct.  It feels sooo cool sending money from **my wallet**  to buy stuff over the internet without a third party (minus the coinbase trade :/). Maybe i should start a business so that i can earn more bitcoin organically. :D

@_date: 2015-05-10 06:55:41
It is possible, but for people new to bitcoin it is hard to fathom how unlikely it is for that to happen. (assuming you are actually generating a true random number). Basically if you used all of the suns energy to operate the most efficient random number generator possible... it would take billions of years just for it to happen once. 
Here, watch this:
Basically, if there was any reason to check... then that would imply that either your random number generator sucks, or the entire system is flawed. **The randomness is what makes bitcoin secure.**  
@_date: 2015-05-29 04:05:12
That's actually really interesting to think about! I might have asked the wrong question though. Sounds like I need to do more research, specifically about pruning. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:31:37
Cool. This is the best argument I've seen for increasing th block size.  
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:55:22
I would like to use bitaddress too, and I keep seeing this advice to move it to an offline computer. I'm more worried about their algorithm producing predictable private keys... it wouldn't require you to send them any information in order for someone to steal your key. With the possibility that their website has been hijacked, do you pretty much just have to proof read the source code and compile it yourself?
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:32:52
Great article. Bitcoin has completely changed the way I see money. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:51:12
I disagree. It may just be my silly psychology but I think seeing what you can buy with a small fraction of a bitcoin... makes bitcoin seem worth more. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:13:30
"Bear in mind there is little distinction to be made between some internet-connected machine with the ability to mandate an offline air-locked machine to sign (through some means) a message, with an internet-connected machine that holds private keys."
That's a good point.
You are thinking more in the context of an exchange. I was thinking of an individual doing their own transaction. But your point still holds I suppose. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 18:49:52
I understood Bitcoinfuturist perfectly. No offence but what you said does not make any sense to me. Maybe this is a problem of definitions? 
Just for clarification, do you know what it means to generate a transaction offline?  As far as I understand, cold wallets are offline wallets, meaning that the private keys are isolated from the internet. Generating a transaction offline means that those private keys are are never on a device that has an internet connection. The wallet is never transferred to a device that is online and only the transaction data needs to be moved. In addition, a cold wallet does not imply multisig. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 06:43:34
The idea is, if by some random chance you end up with the same private/public key pair as someone else, you would have control of their bitcoins. Unless you are both using an incredibly flawed random number generator, this would indicate that the entire system is flawed!
Basically you can just expect that, using a sufficiently random system, generating the same key wont happen, and again if it did happen, that would indicate that the entire system is flawed. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:34:11

[This]( is what I was reading. My idea was that there could be side chains that would be dedicated to different divisions of bitcoin. To be honest I have no idea how it would work though.

Yes it is trivial to send 19MB of spam if the fees are low. . A Larger number if transactions are not irrelevant to processing required to validate transactions. I have an 8 core 4.4ghz processor it takes a lot of electricity and time to validate transactions.

@_date: 2015-07-08 01:23:02
The block size doesn't have anything to do with that load. That load doesn't get put into the blockchain so those are trivial to deal with. Peoples transactions are going through just fine.

You: "Sorry no. Nobody could afford to send that much spam. It's only possible today because genuine transactions are already almost at the cap so adding some extra spam is nothing." 
They are not adding "some extra spam" They have more than tripled the number of normal/legit transactions. Normally I'd say that you are just misinformed, but you are clearly lying to push your agenda.

Yup it's a flat out lie... no way he actually expects people to believe this. This guy is a total troll. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:19:58
Spammers being able to afford an attack has nothing to do with the block size. The cost per transaction will most certainly go down if miners can fit more transactions into a block... when spam isn't happening many miners include transactions with a nearly 0 fee! Have you verified a couple weeks of transactions lately? It takes a ton of processing power.

On a side note this stress test shows that nodes can handle a ton of txs/s. I still can't help but feel like there are some subtle issues to having a larger block sizes. I mean just turning on my node after a couple weeks of being offline takes a couple hours to catch up and makes my cpu roar. I can't help but feel like having 20x the blocksize would make it much worse. Anyways, lots to learn still.

Interesting! While waiting in line at Arby's yesterday to grab a roast beef classic, I was reading one of the many block-size debate threads and I was thinking, if we are to limit the number of transactions, and keep a fee market in place on the main chain, then most of the smaller divisions of bitcoin (below the fee threshold) will never get used! I wonder if this is related somehow. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:52:46
I'm pretty sure transactions just get relayed. Only transactions that enter a block need to be validated

That is one convoluted sad story :'(. 
As someone that works in the "financial services sector", (whatever that means) I don't know how you could have run into so much trouble. Getting bitcoins has been ridiculously easy for me. The initial set up was a little annoying but now I can buy bitcoin whenever I want instantly. 
Not one of your points are  actual problem with bitcoin itself. They are a problem with the services that people have chosen to obtain bitcoins.  If my family or friends needed bitcion to buy something online I can trade them bitcoin for fiat and then click a couple buttons if I want to restore my bitcoin balance. They wouldn't have to deal with any of those "problems".

You have a good point but the difference is that nodes can refuse to upload low fee/size transactions before they enter a block. Every full node will eventually have to download every transaction that enters a block.

I'm not sure what you mean by "seeing bitcoin as a stream of code"?   
The code to Bitcoin or the actual Bitcoin protocol, is public and open source which means anyone with the aptitude can go read the source code to see exactly how bitcoin works.   
A private key is something you generate privately and presumably never tell anyone. The private key is a sequence of numbers and letters that (if randomly generated correctly) is sooooo random... all of the computers in the world, generating random numbers for billions of years, would never produce the same random number again. There are many different ways to generate a private key, and doing it offline is usually recommended. Anyway,  when run through an algorithm the private key produces a public key (or Bitcoin address). If people send bitcoins to that address you are the only person who can send bitcoins away from that address because you are the only person who knows the private key. 
Here, watch this:

I'm not sure why you got downvoted. Maybe because you stated the obvious? Or because nobody understands that a stable economy relies on a ton of people doing their jobs?

Okay, I see where you are coming from and pretty much agree... but this goes against a lot of people who have claimed that miners run on very thin margins. 
In the 2016 Blocks that are required for a difficulty change there will be 2016*25/2 = 25200 less bitcoins rewarded. At the current price that is around $15 million that the miners would have earned before. 
It will be **really** interesting to see how the price and hash rate adjusts! 
Edit: Added Math. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:05:37
Can you explain more? This seems short sighted to me. To maintain blocktimes around 10 minutes, miners will need to keep up a similar hash rate while only receiving half the reward.
For illustration:  At 50% hash rate it will take ~28 days (of 20 minute blocks) for the network to adjust difficulty,  this results in 1/4 the number of bitcoins (per 10 minutes) until the difficulty adjust. (Actually this is more complicated than i realized!)
