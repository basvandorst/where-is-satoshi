Pardon the intrusion on your privacy, but since you've shared, I must ask: did you rub one off?

Well, that would make sense. 
I know for a fact that UBS addressed BTC at an internal employee event in Zurich (their chief global economist, in fact, seems to be well-versed on BTC), and part of that presentation was also made available on the company intranet. 
Disclaimer: I don't work for UBS, but someone very close to me does. I remember this well because he made a point of telling me about it, as he is (painfully) aware of my interest in BTC. I don't think it was supposed to be a "secret" externally though, or anything like that, since they have also publicly commented on BTC many times, as far back as 2011 at least.

He's got no proof because it isn't true. Hard to believe that anyone who frequents this subreddit wouldn't know that major Wall Street firms have published papers on BTC. Not to mention that the Goldman research has been widely covered in the financial media and the business section of the NYT.

Amen to that. By his works ye shall know him... And karma's a bitch. This author shall reap what she has sown.

Should have John Noecker Jr., the chief scientific officer at Juola &amp; Associates, who 
did the linguistic analysis for Forbes comparing Dorian's writings to Satoshis, do the same comparing this paper by Jaap-Henk's to the Satoshi white paper.
