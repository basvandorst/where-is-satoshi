We should really burn up that company..Of course after we got our money.. If I had 1 million at their online wallet I'd drive 10 hours straight to ther HQ and wouldn't come home until I get my money..

Hi guys, I'm new in bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I've reading about bictoin since a couple of weeks now and recently bought €100 on coinbase. It was very hard to verify my ID, and still can't use GDAX. But that's not what I want to say. So I have very bad experiences with coinbase and read a lot about bad services. As I see there is a lot douche who doesn't care bitcoin just want to rip off this industry. Now I decided to take out my money from them (a little but I'd feel better) and asking you for the best or just better place to store my coins. I want to use a provider or developers app who is supporting bitcoin and it's future truly. I don't care if I will pay half of my bitcoins in fee to coinbase, just want to support bitcoin. So please advice me services, apps, and show the general direction. Thanks

A teenager in an early age as he is just can’t make discussions careful enough because hormones and missing basic knowledge of how he world is working..
What you are saying is basically let teenagers do whatever they want, is they don’t die they learning from it..

How about fees? Can I transfer my btc for free from GDAX to Bitstamp for free? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:08:06
Thanks fort sharing this. I think the community need readings like yours to not to be blind stupids.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:08:13
i think it’s not really random
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:41:56
If you download the app then you can give it a 1 star rating.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:36:42
So your loss if about half a week of work. Not a big deal for you..
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:21:39
Yes of course. It's only good for who have to store it on coinbase because of simething. For example I had btc but no gdax verificaion so I had to wait to transfer it with gdax for lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:34:53
Probably you never heard of the thing that they are making new accounts to cover identity.

As a 14 years old you should go and watch cartoon network instead. It's a bit offense I know but as a 14 years old you just way too young for this. And if you think you are smart enough then you wouldn't think about investing in BTC..

Can you please tell me a little about LN? And what's expected?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:24:27
Instead of googling it and read it instantly you posted this here and wait for answers. Not so efficent.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:07:23
Remember [this](
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:00:43
I advice you as a "not so newbie but still" to learn from the basics. First learn the basics and after you learned how the system works you can look for answers to these questions. I'm still curious to these and many other questions but I'm not stressing myselft with it until I have the needed knowledge.
Here is a good one to start:

Can you guys tell me which aantonop video is when he introduces himself? When he talk about the years he spent on studying bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:45:47
I sent "!withdraw &lt;lnbc100uXX&gt;" thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:41:15
It doesn't work for me. !balance shows the amount but the bot doesn't reply to my withdraw request..
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:21:57
No, it's because I bought more yesterday.
@_date: 2018-12-09 09:42:58
LN for everyone!

Thank you so much for your time. I will check it tomorrow, it’s night time here.

Yes it’s a light client, I don’t have a node, and currently I’m over on my second full chain sync with the app crashing at the end. Now I reinstalled it and waiting for the 3rd full sync which take quite a long time.
