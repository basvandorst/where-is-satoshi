Can someone please copy and paste this into pastebin or something? I can't get past the paywall.

They certainly will not support the country in its quest to be free and independent. Rather, they will support whoever can deliver the type of government that the US desires.
And we all know what sort of 'government' the US likes working with the most, right?

Marx was right. He was always right.

I don't think there is any need to call the mother a 'bitch' - she is obviously grieving, but of course is grossly misinformed and thus prone to a mega-knee-jerk-reaction.

Fuck McDonalds. 
I still wouldn't eat their crap if they had a Bitcoin burger or if they even accepted bitcoin.
No thanks.

It's what Bitcoin will eventually replace. Hence people wanting to collect them.
@_date: 2013-10-29 10:55:07
LOL - read that thread - its nuts.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:14:32
Many thanks :)

Really? I could have sworn the words 'United States' weren't there when I initially replied.
Hence **my** reply.
(I was hit in the eye with a shuttlecock a few days ago - perhaps this has something to do with it).
@_date: 2013-07-04 20:41:26
You have to be kidding me.
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:02:50
Your explanation has been edited since my reply, which makes it clearer now.

You feel like a 90 year-old?
I feel like a beer.

The blockchain is more like 8GB.
Once you d/l it all you need to do are smaller syncs afterwards

That's not as daft as it sounds.
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:40:21
Is this doco available for download from anywhere?
@_date: 2013-10-09 05:26:59
Agreed :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:01:06
I've seen your freedom. It needs some improvements.
Thanks for the offer, but I'll pass, thanks.

Is the cafe on Leguna Street going to become a shrine like the house of Walter White was to Albuquerque  meth-heads?
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:23:38
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:08:46
Yeah, sure.

America does not own the internet. It does not own the world.
It's about time it stopped acting like it does.
We're sick of it.

That's awesome.
My niece gets married soon. I think I will do the same. Imagine a paper wallet neatly tucked inside a card.
