Use Native Segwit. If you need to receive funds from some exchange that does not recognize bc1 address, then have them send to your other wallet (nested segwit)
Having funds at a native segwit address means you pay less fees when sending outbound (to any address format)

It's not about skill level, it is about access.
For example, if a person did that, then an interested Reddit employee may take it upon themselves to check the logs and find their IP address or any other personally identifiable info, then track them down, and go put a gun in their face.
Sounds crazy, but that is a lot of money.

QR codes are safer... No one can steal your hard earned coin.
However, for lightning, Zap on iOS is pretty great. Breez is good too.

That seems to be the opposite of the point... If it is so scarce, why would you spend it? The only logical choice is to HODL forever

Yeah, but that probably costs more than the $7 he made

Beware, you may have just tainted your wallet with stolen coins. Could cause problems w/ exchanges, etc.
