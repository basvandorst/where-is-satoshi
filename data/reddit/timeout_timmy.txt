Specification is here:
And unlike mastercoin and ethereum, counterparty was released with a working command line client (nxt is more a bitcoin competitor and not ripple/mastercoin/ethereum/counterparty, at least in theory).  
Finally, counterparty has conducted no marketing whatsoever beyond a single Bitcointalk thread, so if anything it's the opposite of 90% marketing and 10% implementation.

How did *you* mess up, I'm confused?
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:42:55
No, actually it's not.  There's a third-party in control of that fiat transmission who can and will stop it if it doesn't suit them.
With Bitcoin, there's nothing in the way.  No one can stop it.  It's literally as simple as letting someone else know a passphrase.

See btcd.  Full Bitcoin node in a memory safe language (Go) built using modern software engineering practices.
Edit: To their (immense) credit, the bitcoin core devs have done an incredible job avoiding memory safety issues in a memory-unsafe language.

Awesome!  First major brick and mortar franchise, if I'm not mistaken.  This is pretty huge.

Yeah, all the Bitcoin devs (maaku7, petertodd, gmaxwell) don't get it, do they?
Wow, the things miners tell themselves to justify their greed and ignorance.

Yes, all true, but for a corporate legal office, approving an asset that may drop to single digit values is a massive step away from knowingly approving adoption of a fraudulent activity, for which they could be held liable both civilly and criminally.
Or, in your own words, "they will jump on any bandwagon which they think will assist provided it isnt[sic] illegal."  Running a pyramid scam is clearly illegal.

"We reach out our hand of friendship to Bitcoin ATM operators and encourage them to come within the fold of our industry and its governance framework and best practices. The time is right to integrate them upfront into an industry with a proven four-decade-long track record of secure, convenient services to cardholders and consumers."
Wait, are we talking about the same industry that still uses *Windows XP* in many/most of its products, and whose "secure" services are routinely exploited by skimmers and crackers?

So you contacted them to ask them to watch out for the stolen coins (presumably including some of your own)?  Then, when they did what you asked, you wrote up a controversial Reddit post calling their actions into question?
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:37:18


Think about it.  If someone stages a simulation of the Bitcoin network, and you connect to it, are your Bitcoins at risk?  No, the worst they can do is make you think you've paid someone when you actually haven't.  Because they don't have the real blockchain that everyone else is using, so any transactions on it will be worthless.
Also, the same risks apply when connecting through Tor as they do connecting through the regular Internet.  Bitcoin's defenses against these kinds of attack are not dependent upon the low-level network protocols they're running on top off.
Finally, I'm just curious how your thinking here goes.  If you're not an expert in this field, how do you know there are technical/theoretical risks?

As long as you generated your wallet on Windows, Linux, OSX, BSD, or any other computer that uses a secure random number generator, almost certain no.
Electrum uses Python's os.urandom (via the Python ECDSA library), which uses cryptographically strong random number generators wherever they are available.
More important, Electrum's developer -- like Multibit's -- are responsible developers concerned about the security of their users.  So if they somehow discover a weakness in one of their processes, they'll be on here and other forums disclosing it to their users (they probably even have a way to do it via the Electrum app itself).

Something fishy is up.  Some of the numbers miners are reporting don't make sense.
I'm beginning to think some outside entity might be subsidizing GHash.io.  To what ends, I think is pretty clear.

Oh nice, perfect gift for my wife for Christmas.
Nice idea for a business, by the way.  Wish I could come up with such a creative idea -- I've got the software development skills and experience, but just can't think of any good business ideas.

I don't know, but we'd need several hundred responses to be able to draw any conclusions with an acceptable CI (out of ~120,000 Bitcoin Redditors).
Also, I'd change the wording of a few questions (last question in particular was unclear).  I threw up this survey over the course of a half hour, just to try to get a true picture of why people were choosing GHash.
If enough people would support it, I'd try again.  But I don't want to bother people.
@_date: 2014-06-22 16:33:04
Thanks!  Here's my first tip from  for $5.00
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:35:01
I realize that, but I gave my word I'd publish this survey if people participated, so I'm keeping that promise.  I tried to get more responses, but no luck.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:41:39
You're fine.  As long as you keep an eye to make sure they're not climbing above 20-25%, what you're doing is great and admirable.  Thank you.
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:32:43
Read far enough into that thread, and you'll even  see a rep from GHash come on and admit that the double-spend took place, but that it was a rogue employee that they've since fired (supposedly).
@_date: 2014-09-16 10:03:15


I think you're underestimating the difficulty involved here.  This isn't "Uni student" internship-level stuff.  Bitcoin-core has several extremely experienced full-time devs working on it -- it's not some semi-abandoned open source project on Sourceforge (well, ok maybe it's *partially* on Sourceforge, but still...).
Do you really want a university student making radical changes to a codebase undergirding a 7 billion dollar economy that depends on consensus to survive?

Suvorov's books are absolutely fascinating.  Highly recommended.  I'm not 100% convinced he's always telling the truth, but he's always entertaining.

First of all, that almost certainly isn't Hal's address -- it's Satoshi's.  It's the generation tx for the block that *mined* the first network transaction.  It's not any of the addresses that participated in the first transaction.
It's still got the original 50 on it, which is characteristic of a Satoshi address.  Hal had medical expenses to pay for and inheritance to consolidate, so he probably wasn't leaving 50 btc laying around.
So please, no one bother Hal's family about this.  It would not only be seriously uncool to disturb a grieving family, but also it's almost certainly not his address and there's absolutely nothing anyone there could do about it.
I'm really sorry for your friend's misfortune, and I appreciate that you want to help him fix it.  But it was his mistake, and his mistake alone.
And there's absolutely nothing that can be done about it now.  It's gone.
EDIT: Since the conversation below has degraded into accusations toward Bitcoin of being an "error-exacerbating system", I'd like to explain *why* transactions are irreversible in Bitcoin:
The problem is that in order to reverse a transaction, some person or entity has to make a judgment between two competing claims: the payer and the payee.  But by its very nature, Bitcoin is a *decentralized, distributed* system.  Every node is equal is the eyes of the Bitcoin protocol.  So there is no one "authority" in the system with the power to make this call.  This is a really simple concept, but it's not clear to me if Bitcoin's critics on this front understand this basic reality about decentralized systems.
By the way, in the eyes of most Bitcoiners, this is a *feature* not a flaw.  Unfortunately, it has occasional negative consequences like when a payment is sent to an incorrect address, but most of us are pretty happy with the fact that payments are irreversible.
@_date: 2014-02-03 13:33:54
Exactly this.  The fact that people are burning BTC for XCP shows their confidence in the technology.  Indeed, this is the easiest way the transfer value from BTC to XCP in order to bootstrap the currency.  If XCP purchasers had instead been instructed to donate to a charity in exchange for XCP, the value would then be with that charity, and not the counterparty project.
I can, and frequently do, donate Bitcoin to various people and charities, but that's not what the counterparty burn was about.  It was about bootstrapping an innovative new currency with integrated decentralized exchange and many other features.
Besides, counterparty's was almost certainly the fairest distribution -- no single person or entity is ending up with 50 or 60% of the currency.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:26:09
Are you kidding?  Come on, it's easy to get jaded in but Bitcoin is the first real, working, accepted implementation of *Internet money*, which has been a highly-sought-after target since the advent of the Internet.
And it's decentralized!  I really don't see how you could overestimate its importance if it becomes widely accepted and exchanged -- and it's well on its way already.

In an effort to understand GHash's dominant market position, I have created a very short web survey. 
Why are miners chosing GHash.io?  Is it fees?  Appearance? Customer support?  
We don't know, but with this survey I hope to find out.
If you are a GHash customer, please take a few seconds to complete the survey.
The survey can be found here:
I will release the results of this survey to the public domain in 24 hours.  I hope that either I or another potential competitor will be able to use this data to create a competing service.
Thank you.

What exactly are you referring to?  People encouraging alternative implementations?
If so, I'm afraid you'll need to include Gavin in that group [1]:
"Diversity is a good thing. Diverse, inter-operating implementations of the Bitcoin protocol make the network more robust against software bugs, denial-of-service attacks, and vulnerabilities."

I'm trying to understand why people are choosing GHash.io.  So I created a survey.  My hope is that potential competitors to GHash will be able to use this information to improve their services and offerings to better meet the need of GHash customers.
If you are a GHash customer, please take a few seconds to complete the survey:
Already, a good number of GHash customers have completed the one-page survey.  I will release the results of this survey to the public domain in 24 hours. I hope that either I or another potential competitor will be able to use this data to create a competing service.
Thank you.

Here's a logical question for you, then.  Would the legal departments of:

We've been trying that for months now.  It's pretty clear that most people just don't care.  But I'm pretty amazed that they're going to kill something they're profiting off of.
It's pretty clear now that it's stupidity, ignorance, and stubbornness more than greed.

They *did* implement the idea.  I can't believe how many people here are missing this basic truth.  Do you guys not read the post?  As the guy said, this wasn't just 2 guys talking in a coffee shop.  They *implemented* the idea with code and design, wrote a pitch, and won a hackathon, and then made the bad decision to bring someone on board who basically took the idea and ran without them once she had a funding contact.  Not cool.
This isn't some, "that guy stole the idea I posted on Reddit last year!".  This is...they were starting a business, built a prototype, won a major hackathon, brought on someone on board with industry experience in the area they were advised to focus on, who then took the project and ran with it.  It was much more a palace coup kind of thing than a "hur dur my idea was stolen".
As a professional developer, I can't stand "idea men", but I'm not at all getting that vibe here.
That said, because some  people clearly only read titles, OP made a mistake by entitling the thread "....idea stolen".  The *project* was stolen, not the idea.  In fact, he may have legal recourse.  I'd look into it if she continues to raise significant funds (and it sounds like this is her modus operandi).

Have you interviewed for many software engineer jobs with big corporations, and (even worse) recruiters for big corporations?  If you don't approach these things with suspicion, you'll end up coding CRUD apps in Java when you were recruited to build DSL's in Scala (for example).  It's happened to me and many of my friends (it only happened to me *once*, now I'm much more cautious).  There are always promises of "eventually" but no firm plans.
And how it works is not that you're told the truth during the interview, unless you ask very specific and pointed questions.  It's that you find out *after* you start the job.  And it happens all the time.
In this case, I suspect that they're "considering" implementing Bitcoin support.  And maybe they will, eventually, or maybe they won't.  But this job is clearly at least partly oriented toward their existing payment processing system, just look at the skills involved (DUKPT algorithms, TR-39 PIN security standard, etc.).

I agree with your interpretation of history here.  However, how does it address your parent comment?  For example, all these "money laundering" laws in discussion here came into effect only as the cold war was ending, and many of them have only started to be enforced for non-organized crime in the past 10 years.

Yes, that would perfectly explain his "leaked by a hacker" Tulip Trust document:
This is one of the docs shopped around to media outlets last year by the "hacker" of Wright's email.
It's all starting to make sense now.  Wright wants to get his hands on the Bitcoins that now belong to the family of the (perhaps) true Satoshi, who died back in 2013 after being hospitalized in 2011 (and perhaps they can't access them, because encrypted, or corrupt, etc.).  
I don't think a judge, US or Australian, is going to be sympathetic to that letter.  But perhaps a gullible investor will be.

I suspect this is just a play by Target to get a better quality of software engineer than they usually would for their payment processing department by making the position sound cutting edge and exciting.
Yeah, they played buzzword bingo and threw out "blockchain" and "bitcoin", but when you look at the specific skills/background needed, my guess is that this person will be working on Target's existing payment processing systems primarily.

100%.  If the real Satoshi turns out to be a dick or a fraud (and none of his prior communications in 2008-2010 suggest this is the case), I move to nominate Dorian as the official Satoshi.
Dorian, if you're reading this, keep on rockin', man!
