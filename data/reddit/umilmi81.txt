You are completely right.  Digital currency poses a good threat against the world monetary system, but nobody can know which one, if any one, will emerge as the dominant standard.  Anyone who claims otherwise is either ignorant or lying.
Bitcoin has nothing going for it other than being first.  There are other clever coins that do add on what Bitcoin is lacking.  Bitcoin could also change to add these missing features in the future.  It's a wide open field and there is no objective way to measure the long term value of a coin.
That being said, I'm glad these crypto-currencies are emerging to offer a real threat to fiat currency.  I personally am staying vested in fiat currency, but I'm glad something is threatening competition to fiat currency to "keep it honest".

I don't think Lightning Network is supposed to make Bitcoin more accessible to the common masses.  I think it's supposed to cement Bitcoin as the coin of financial institutions.  I think Bitcoin stopped being a coin for the people a while ago.  There are other coins for that.

But the security of the Internet is not determined by being computationally complex like blockchain.  The security of the internet is determine by non-anonymous cryptography.  I say I'm umilmi81, you say you are bitstamperio.  I encrypt my message with my private key and your public key, you decrypt my message with my public key and your private key.  Now I know my message can only be read by you, and you know my message really came from me.
But Bitcoin is built to be anonymous.  The security in the anonymous system comes from the computational difficulty.  If blockchain processing ever becomes simple and fast, then the security of the blockchain becomes compromised.

You have a pretty low bar of success.  Until my mother can buy a knickknack with bitcoin it's not a success.  It's too complicated and slow for 99.999% of the population to use.  Even among Generation Z it's too complicated and slow to use.  And sadly that's not fixable.  Being complicated and slow are features, not bugs.  If it ceases to be complicated and slow then it ceases to function.

If it's mandatory and you don't have a choice of doing it or where you get the "product", then it's not a service.  It's an obligation.
In the US children must go to school and you have no choice on which school district you are assigned to.
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:57:27


Yeah, I guess, but you are still paying your taxes as if your children were going to school.  So you need to be pretty wealthy to afford the luxury of paying for your child's education twice.

The government doesn't and shouldn't "create" those things.  Those things are created by the free market and the government funds them through taxes.


The government does **do** those things, but those are overhead costs, not goods or services.  Governments have 4 jobs.  If a government doesn't do these 4 things then it's not a government.  It's a social club or something else.  It can't call itself a government if it doesn't:
* Enforce contracts
* Settle disputes
* Defend from enemies
* Punish aggression
Those are all overhead costs, not "products".  Governments need to organize and operate police, military, prisons, and courts.  Governments are the dispassionate threat and use of violence.  Government is the "or else" of law.  Wear your seat belt "or else".  Pay your taxes "or else".

Limited supply is exactly why Bitcoin is failing as a currency.  Billions of dollars are changing hands every hour but nobody is buying shit with it.  They are trading it on speculation.  This is exactly why the gold standard had to go.  When the "smart financial move" is to bury your money in the back yard instead of spending or investing it the economy grinds to a halt.
What kind of a lunatic would invest $1,000 for 4% return when they can stuff it in their mattress and get 15% return?
Inflation hurts the rich more than the poor.  Losing 3% of $50 doesn't hurt as much as losing 3% of $50,000,000.
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:57:44


That is the whole point of the post. 
*"Why is inflation bad?"*
Inflation is not bad when it is a result of productive people making new goods and services for other people.
Inflation **is** bad when it is a result of governments borrowing money that has to be paid back by the taxpayers.  The missing piece of information that I failed to include is that the only good thing about the gold standard is that the government can't borrow money.  Under the gold standard the government must get 100% of it's revenue through taxation.
Notice that I make no statement about how much tax is "good" and how much is "bad".  I simply want government funding to come through taxation, not borrowing/inflation.  If we, as a people, want a 90% income tax, then so be it.  But we don't want a 90% tax do we?  The government uses borrowing and inflation to tax us at astronomical rates and we don't even realize it.
In fact calling our tax "astronomical" actually understates it.  There are only 180,000,000,000 stars in the Milky Way.  The US debt is $20,000,000,000,000.  There are 1000X more dollars in the US national debt than there are stars in the galaxy.

Inflation evaporates wealth is "debunked and baseless nonsense".  Got it.  Thanks for the hot take.
@_date: 2019-03-15 14:19:43


No I don't.  I'm unable to make any of the connections you seem to be implying.  I have no idea how the Koch brothers advocating libertarian principals "helps the billionaires".
I have no idea how inflation could be "used properly" to fix the healthcare industry.
I have no idea how the rule of law is a "tool of the rich" and hurts the poor.
So no, I don't get the idea.

I'm talking about $50 in savings.  Poor people with no savings are said to be living "hand to mouth".  On average their cost of living matches their income.  They don't make enough to save, but they make enough to survive.  As the cost of living rises *typically* their salaries rise to match.
Again, in that situation, a poor person won't "feel" inflation as much as a rich person.  You can see this demonstrated in the real world by the television show "Shark Tank" (or the British version "The Dragon's Den").  Why are those rich people so eager to make a deal?  Because wealth that's not growing is actually shrinking.
Mark Cuban is actually considered to be a bit of a failure because over 20 years he only grew $1 bn to $1.1 bn.  That's only a 10% wealth growth over 20 years.  It's actually quite a loss considering inflation.

And eventually gold.  Everyone laughs at gold but once the immediate crisis is over gold has a lot going for it.  It's hard to counterfeit, it doesn't rust, it can be melted and reshaped over and over, it's physically beautiful, and easy to carry.
You literally couldn't design a better medium for barter.  There is a reason all cultures spontaneously assigned value to gold without a central authority pushing it.  You'd give up your car right now for a big enough piece of gold.  Anyone who claims gold would be useless to barter with has never held a piece of gold in their hands.

Credit is created out of thin air but so are iPhones and LED televisions.
In fact a definition of a human may be *"An animal that creates things out of thin air."*
The problem with fiat currency isn't that it's created out of thin air, it's who's allowed to create it out of thin air.  A business owner putting up his assets as collateral who needs credit to upgrade his business so he can make more things (out of thin air) doesn't hurt the economy because on net he's going to be adding to the total sum of things humans can buy.
A government on the other hand, that doesn't make a god damn thing, borrowing money and putting up the citizens as collateral as though they are tax slaves is a problem.

True, but gold passes the "regression test".  Gold works as a medium of exchange and it **also** has desirability for other reasons.  In addition to being a currency gold is also used in manufacturing and art.  Gold never rusts.  Gold can be melted and remelted a near unlimited number of times.  Gold is hard to counterfeit.  Gold is rare.
Ninja edit: I am not shitting on crypto as a currency with a niche.  I'm shitting on it as an investment strategy.

I didn't criticize it as a savings storage device, I criticized it as an investment.  Though I think I'll take the opportunity to criticize it now :)
Anything that can go up 40% in a week can also go down 40% in a week.
The one intriguing thing about crypto is circumventing banks.  In an era where Chase is closing the account of the NRA and Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal are refusing to conduct transactions for people they disagree with politically, the world seems to need a decentralized electronic currency.

I wish nothing but the best for you guys and hope bitcoin is a major disrupting force, but I don't see the wisdom in "investing" in currency.  Currency is for spending.  Bitcoin is still really bad at that purpose.  It's a fundamental flaw.  In order to be secure it needs to be computationally complex (aka "slow").  You can't have the benefit without the drawback.  They are intrinsically tied together and if either of those attributes change the currency becomes useless.
I'm feeling the FOMO really hard.  I laughed at bitcoin when it was $3.  Yes, I hate myself for not grabbing some.  But I invested in Vanguard mutual funds instead.  I'm not a millionaire, but I'm building wealth slowly and hopefully in a stable and sustainable way.  Of course there are never any guarantees in life.

Bitcoin Cash is not bad.  Bitcoin Cash is the market response to a stupid decision by Bitcoin.  Bitcoin refuses to make reasonable and easy changes that increase the volume of trading that is possible.  Bitcoin Cash is just Bitcoin with those very easy and reasonable changes implemented.
Bitcoin Cash is the ideal of open source.  When a pack of assholes tries to ruin a product someone just forks it and does the right thing.

That's fine for people living hand to mouth.  Of course you have to spend your money to buy groceries.  But for people who have large amounts of wealth the way they grow the purchasing power of their gold is by putting it in a hole.
An often under appreciated turning point in history is how coming off the gold standard defeated communism.  Marx had one (and only one) crucial point.  The longer economic systems run the more wealth gets accumulated into the hands of fewer and fewer people.
When a nation is on a gold standard this is a major problem as the money supply is finite.  If "the rich" aren't spending money then there is literally no money for other people.
In an economic system with inflation (fiat currency) the value of money is constantly depreciating.  A mega-rich individual must ferociously and continuously grow their wealth or their money literally evaporates.  If there is 6% inflation a person with $500 in the bank loses $30 worth of purchasing power year over year.  Naturally they aren't happy about that but it's not going to make or break them.
For someone with $500,000,000 in the bank losing 6% per year is $30,000,000.  So when someone with that much money comes across an entrepreneur or a venture capital opportunity they say "Fuck it.  May as well take the chance."
Edit: ~~Inflation literally destroyed communism.~~ Inflation destroyed the only reasonable argument in favor of Communism.

You just demonstrated one of the problems with Bitcoin.  It's the same problem as the gold standard.  When you believe that money is going to increase in the future you treat it as an investment instead of as money.
Why spend your gold (or bitcoins) when you believe they will be worth more in the future?
@_date: 2018-07-16 22:18:47
You are ignorant of history.  Read about the Robber Barrons. There were mega-rich before we left the gold standard and they used their possession of the money supply as a weapon.
Being rich today means you can buy nice things and manipulate markets a little bit but you can't hold nations hostage. When a bank runs out of money they just print more and the printing of more money disproportionately hurts the rich more than it hurts the poor.
