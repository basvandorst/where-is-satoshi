The real question is, is 21MM actually the hard cap on bitcoin? If S2X goes through and every node does not update, that essentially means there is not consensus on blocksize, and if theres not consensus on blocksize, then what is there to say there can be consensus on bitcoin

Hasnt Bitfinix already confirmed it will support BTG?

Can you elaborate on your future trades and what you did...

I use Exodus and never have to spend that much on transaction fees

But look at top. Without Replay Protection wouldn't selling BTG make your BTC vulnerable?

Didn't McAfee tweet out that he likes Verge Cryptocurrency?

 - thoughts?

Yes you're right. I believe Bitfinex set up some sort of futures market to test confidence in either coin post split.

What effect would this have on BTC pricing and valuation? If any...

Love to hear your thoughts after you read this piece.

But how many people uninformed enough to take BTG seriously will be informed enough to find a way to sell it?
