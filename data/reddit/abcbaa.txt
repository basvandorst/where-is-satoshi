It's a surprising statistic - so much so that I thought it was a joke to start off with - the more I thought about it though, it seems like the data is true, and it's just Bitcoin that's extremely unequally distributed. The people who had Bitcoin at the start are really raking it in I guess...

Given that this is the case, The bottom 50-odd percent of all addresses own 0.02% of the coins - doesn't that portion of the data show high inequality?

That's a very fair point - thinking about it now and seeing various news articles use these figures (e.g.  [ ), it's becoming more clear that this data's flaws are just being exploited to convey anti-Bitcoin rhetoric.

That's for fiat-backed stablecoins, but there are stablecoins like "Wrapped BTC"  ([ ) that explicitly back 1:1 with crypto. I can't imagine how they keep these stable though...

Where should I post this? Sorry if it's in the wrong place!

Surely transaction fees will start rising before this limit though, as the rewards for mining decrease...?

Am I right in saying that any stablecoin that uses a certain cryptocurrency as collateral will peg its value to that cryptocurrency?

I've just seen this website - it's really amazing! It's the place to go for cryptocurrency-related news. One thing I might advise for the Edu section is a search bar maybe, so that if there's anything in particular you're searching for, it'd be easy to find. Apart from that, it's a really good job. Well done!

Just a quick question - once Bitcoin reaches its 21 million limit, how much higher do you think transaction fees are going to go?
