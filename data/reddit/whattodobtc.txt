I need it to stay on the exchanges because I actively trade sometimes. I open positions based on the market action on a particular day and only close them when i've made a profit.

Youre assuming 40 hrs a week. i've never been lucky enough to find employers to give me that many hours. its usually much less. and then they always require me to have a completely open schedule, so that i cant work 2 jobs.

honestly man.. ive lost enough now that 55k feels like nothing in comparison. given that I know what bitcoin is going to do to revolutionize money and the world economy, i have a pretty good feeling that it's going to end up rebounding from this. so i would naturally be willing to put all of that 55k back into bitcoin to profit from the upswing.
the **problem** is, and the reason why i posted this thread, is that I dont know what I should expect the timeline for recovery to be. i cannot afford to continue to hold this position for longer than 8 months or so. i have to answer for what has happened to the money. the reason i posted this thread was to get a general idea of what people here would **do in my shoes** given that they know a) bitcoin has true value and  b) bitcoin has pretty much grown in value its entire life (do a linear regression on a log chart of btc to usd to see this, its pretty much linear up).
All this keeping in mind that a person like me can't wait forever for the market to fix itself. i have to start using this money within a year.

My net position is long ~360 coins right now.

I might not be an expert but i have spent many years learning technical analysis and I definitely know more about it than the average trader. As I said before we are all just stuck in a really horrible downswing that I doubt anyone was prepared for or predicted would happen.

I've read about this quite a bit and im pretty confident that big money is here and it's here to stay. Winklevoss twins have begin moving forward with their ETF financial product and that's going to open the door to mom and pop investors that want to own bitcoins without having to touch the tech. On top of that, it seems pretty clear that wallstreet has been itching to get into this space to control bitcoin by buying it up cheap, and i've been thinking maybe thats part of the reason why the price has been manipulated downards for so long: to bring the price down to a level that is palatable to wallstreet bankers that want to own coins before they increase in value rapidly during the next bubble.

Listen man, I'm in a tough situation and comments like these don't really help much. I'm trying to get some advice on what to do with my positions as they are.
And I'd like to add: I'm not gambling. The market is just being irrational at the moment. I think I explained in my post that i've been studying chart movements and things like support and resistance. I understand the technical side of things and I've made money doing it. But now I need some fundamentals to back everything up in the end to know if it makes sense to keep holding hoping for a rebound or if I should just cut losses. More than half of my parent's estate is gone now, but I could possibly buy more BTC to double up when the bull market re-emerges. I just need some reasons to believe this is actually going to happen because after months and months of mostly down I am starting to get really worried that this will never turn around.
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:33:37
I mostly just look for big downswings. Usually anything that goes down 15% or so within a 3 day window, I open a long position using 5% of my available margin. If the price continues to go down I'll open some more smaller positions with 1 or 2 % more margin until I see another big downswing, at which point I open another position with 5%. I have had to scale this number back though recently because I've been using a lot of my available margin lately and I don't know how much more I can handle before it's all gone.

I went to school as a traditional student for a while, ended up taking medical leave [depression :(], then came back to finish. I'm too far into my majors to quit now, i'm doing double major of sociology and history of art and architecture. i'm in debt from this as well (18k a year tuition + room and board) and it causes me a lot of stress on top of what im dealing with so thanks for bringing it up.

I've been successful before many times. I think we are all just going through a period of bad luck and maybe it isn't as bad as my mind is making it out to be. I wasnt in bitcoin during the days it went from 32 to 2. that mustve been devastating. i know a lot of other people in this sub have lost money recently but a lot of em aren't selling because they believe in the future of bitcoin. i'm trying to get in that mind state but i keep having these demons of doubt coming up time and time again trying to convince me to just bow out.

if i buy at $100 for 1 coin and it goes to $50, but then knowing we've hit the bottom (or atleast we're close to it) based on technical analysis then I can put in another $200 and buy 4 coins. Now i have 5 coins i purchased for $300. Now when the price goes back up to $100 I'll have $500 making a profit of $200 i wouldnt have otherwise have. not only did I make back my money, but i also made profit off the upswing by being smart enough to buy when prices were at the bottom.


I have to. this is my job. it's a lot of stress. I am managing my family's investments and it is for better or worse almost entirely in bitcoin at the moment. I wish I had seriously gotten into bitcoin trading (i.e., not just with my personal account) before the december bubble so that i could have sold when it was selling at 900 or 1000 a coin but in  this case i missed the boat so to speak.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:33:03
I only have $55k left in that account. Had to spend some of it for repairs/remodel of the family home. Unfortunately (or fortunately, I guess) I'm the only one that knows how much of the estate is left because I took complete control of the account. I don't know how I can possibly explain it, and its probably going tear my family apart. That's why I'm looking for any good reason to hold at this point and hope for a recovery so that I can fix this situation without having to resort to that.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:13:50
I'm going to repeat this again. Investing in bitcoin isnt gambling. We are just seeing the longest sustained downturn in a LOOONNGG time. There is such a thing as being unlucky. It happens to the best of us.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:08:04
how am i delusional when the market has been completely irrational for an **extended period of time**? this isn't a normal market, as I said before bitcoin has a tremendous amount of value and its not being realized by the market. that's where we (the intelligent traders) come in and buy up an opportunity that is primed to explode. but unfortunately i do not have a 20 year time horizon here, i have to make decisions based on the relative near term becuase this money will need to be used for expenses soon. i didnt imagine that we would be in a downturn for this long. the previous bubble pops didnt last this long so i didnt see this coming. but my question is how long is this going to go for? is it possible it could be for another year? if so i cannot afford to wait that long. once i start dipping into the estate i'll have to lock in losses and that will simply be unacceptable.
Im trying to figure out the best way to play this. if the trend is down, and continues as such, maybe i should just sell my long positions and then switch to short so that i can capture as much of the downside as possible. then switch back to long when we get some reversal in price trend and see a definite uptick that is indicative of renewed growth in bitcoin value. i would love to see it go back up to $1000 by the end of december, that would fix all my problems. but if not i am willing to settle for atleast enough to get me to break even.

I'm a college student double majored in Sociology and History of Art and Architecture. This is my 6th year and I should be graduating in the spring. I had to take several semesters half load and took some time off school to deal with the loss. i mentioned in my OP that it will take me about 10 years to get into a position where i can support my family with my income; thats because its kind of hard to find jobs in this field (yeah i know, i would have done things differently if i knew what i know now) and the jobs available have a really steep curve for advancement. So i'm not expecting much in terms of salary at a "normal" job. I'm hoping that I can just sidestep all that and go full time trading when im done with school, focusing on forex, bitcoin, and maybe some commodities and options trading. All the jobs i've had so far are just part time. worked at a few clothing stores and some local restaurants waiting (though that turned out to be more headache than i bargained for).
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:53:18
The patronizing tone isn't necessary. I have learned the whole way along this journey of becoming a full time trader managing my family's finances. I just got stuck in the longest downturn in bitcoin price movement that has ever been seen. most of bitcoin's history has been a positive uptrend.
Yes, I made some dumb moves early on. Especially when I was leveraging 100:1 trading forex for tiny scalp moves. I didn't know what I was doing early on and that was the price I had to pay. It wasn't a life-breaking amount of money too, just a few hundred dollars.
but after a while I started getting in the rhythm of trading. I started to see patterns and learned to have a plan when i was going into a trade instead of just wishing for it to go up and down. I learned a bit about risk management and controlling my bankroll so that i didnt risk too much of it at a time. So in that sense I learned from those mistakes.
As for mtgox, I learned to not have all my eggs in 1 basket. that was the important lesson. i wont ever do that again. thats why i decided to diversify across a couple exchanges instead of just one. it makes trading a little harder because i have to execute trades on two platforms at the same time. but atleast i know that i cant lose everything just because one ends up being shady.
i dont agree though that there is a cognitive bias. a lot of us here have lost money and some other users in this sub share the same pain I do. we are all looking for a reason to keep going at this despite the terrible news for the past months. its not just all fun and games. some of us are responsible for paying the bills and at the end of the day we're just trying to make some money to feed our families you know?
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:02:08
Chart analysis is the way that most real traders actually make money. The previous price movements heavily affect future movements, and it takes some training to be able to find, understand, and exploit these patterns. I've been doing this for quite some time and have gone through many ups and downs with it. but over the long term if youre analysis is good you will be profitable. there are tons of forums out there with proof of traders that are very successful from studying chart patterns and i suggest you do some research on it.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:41:31
I have tried to have work regular jobs before but they have never paid out as well as what I make trading forex or bitcoin. It just seems like a waste of time to work a job that makes $1200 a month when I can spend my time successfully planning and executing a trade that makes me that much in a single day. I just think my time is better spent doing what i do best, which is trading and analyzing markets.
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:13:48
Listen. I am not rich. This is money that I was put in charge of to invest for my family. My remaining parent is a foreigner and doesn't know anything about investing or trading. Siblings are all younger than me and don't have any expertise, so it was a pretty straightforward decision to put me in charge of the account for investment purposes because i have have the most experience doing this (been trading forex a while and before that when i was in HS i was trading tech stocks on etrade)
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:04:56
It isn't though. I've made plenty of money by exploiting trends in price movement and using indicators to infer where it's going next. And tons of other people have. I think its just that bitcoin has a bit more manipulation going on because the price movement isnt matching up with its true value. True value is many multiples of what its currently trading at. I don't need to explain why, I think you already know. This is going to be replacing (or atleast I really hope so) fiat within the next 10 to 20 years so it's going to have to grow enough that it can handle that kind of market cap. I just worry sometimes that I won't be able to hold out for 10 or 20 years to see that vision. I need to explain to my family what happened to this money and they're not going to like it if i ask them to wait longer for BTC price to get to the level it's supposed to be at.
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:18:29
0.1% is unacceptable return. if i move everything out of bitcoin its going to have to go into some other investment that can make back atleast some of the losses. Atleast something. 0.1 is basically nothing. thats just admitting defeat.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:42:39
but how long before we see a turn around? i can accept getting back up to maybe $550 or $600. I will have still lost money but atleast i can explain that. I just do not have the ability to wait years for that to happen. i have to find another way, another avenue, to trade this money up to recover the losses in the bitcoin market. i have people depending on me and yes although i fucked up im determined to fix this situation before anyone finds out.
@_date: 2014-10-04 11:56:07
So I have about 55k left in the checking account that has the estate money (had to use some of it for repairs/replacements on the water heater / basement HVAC / remodeling of the family house). I think we are either at the bottom or very near. Is it a bad idea to take that and invest it now since it's likely to double or triple (or hopefully more :) ) when the next bubble comes?
Also how long are you expecting before we can see a reverse in the current (horrible, slow, painful) downtrend?
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:17:07
if technical analysis is bunk and 'astrology' as you call it then why have so many people been able to have successful careers trading on technical analysis alone? there are tons of examples of this and i understand that you worked in HFT but your experience isnt the be-all-end-all of trading. there are tons of people like me that spend their time analyzing patterns in charts and find ways to exploit inefficiencies in the market to make a profit. just because you weren't able to doesn't mean its not possible.
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:35:12
After all that happened with gox im pretty sure that no exchange is going to be dumb enough to pull off that shit again. But in the worst case I do have my funds diversified across more than one exchange so I can't lose everything atleast.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:46:03
Ok but tell me **why**. because if i sell now I'll be locking in a loss of over 100k in USD that I will probably not be able to earn in time to pay off. plus the fact that it's going to cripple me for life to have to work that long to pay such a massive debt.
i'm at a really weird crossroads. i can let my investment roll as it is or i can quit it. both options look equally attractive (one has no more risk of loss, but a definite loss lock-in; the other has risk of more loss but what i am pretty sure is a massive probability of upside that results in me not only making the money back but also making a tidy profit on top)
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:38:54
What if I just wait for the bottom and then invest the rest of the inheritance account (~55k)? that way, in case we move up from here I wont miss out on profits and in the worst case I'll be able to recover some losses from the reinvestment at the bottom.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:28:26
But the thing is, this isn't gambling. It's investing. After all I've read and all the research I've done, and based on my understanding of how fiat money is so easily gamed by central banks, its a long term certainty that cryptocurrencies are going to either a) supplant them entirely or b) become a big enough force that they directly compete with fiat. I'm just not 100% sure if bitcoin is going to be the one crypto that ends up ruling the crypto space, otherwise I wouldnt have even posted this.
I guess its like betamax versus VHS tapes. I want to be on the right side of history because this is literally going to make me or break me. I haven't seen much news about anything that would threaten bitcoin in the recent past so I'm leaning towards just holding out for the next inevitable bubble -- it's happened many times before so we're due for another "upward correction"
