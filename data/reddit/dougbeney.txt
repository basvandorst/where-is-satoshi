Wow. Just bought my first ether recently from you guys. Luckily this was of course before the hack. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:14:36
Exactly what I was wondering. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:21:26
Prepare to be surprised.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:36:46
I hope that most of those pictures were staged for some sort of weird stock photo and some people don't actually live like that.
@_date: 2016-03-28 21:24:57
Interesting. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-03-28 03:35:32
That's what I was thinking. I'm still under the impression that they sold that functionality to another company. It's the only logical explanation. It's like a subway station saying you can no longer ride trains, you can only look at the pretty maps.
@_date: 2016-03-28 19:38:59
Does anyone have control to "print" new Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:41:09
Compulsive hodling, lol.
@_date: 2016-03-28 03:33:48
Perhaps they sold that functionality to another company. My only guess.
@_date: 2016-03-28 19:36:31
Good to see they won't be completely off the map. OPENDIME looks pretty interesting. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 03:36:35
It wouldn't make it a business either to take away the main functionality. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:02:35
ETH seems to be doing really good - at $28 right now. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:21:03
Yeah, it wouldn't have even been Facebook if they were in charge. Didn't they call it HarvardConnect or something? It would've probably remained a college social network and Myspace might even still have market share today.
What do you hate about Zuckerberg? Not doubting you, just wondering. Is it mainly because of Facebook censorship, business decisions, or something else? 
@_date: 2016-03-28 05:18:30
True. Twitter did start as a podcasting company after all. I still don't get why they wouldn't just launch a new ap.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:56:36
What degrees were they getting, if you mind me asking? People are getting into a lot of debt at early ages these days. Props to you for paying it all off! Another BTC success story.
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:51:28
Yeah, I actually figured that out fairly recently. :) My initial idea with getting involved with Bitcoin was to just buy a good amount so that if the price spikes up, I'll profit. I don't care about that now and I'm just interested in it as a future technology.

That Yao Ming meme is used by companies. There's a ton of merch that you can buy with that meme on it.

@_date: 2016-06-03 15:11:35
What do you recommend as an alternative?
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:51:44
Trailer Park Boys references in Anything is possible!
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:50:17
get.rich.quick. &lt;- I'd imagine that's how the short-term mindset works.
@_date: 2016-06-02 15:29:03
Not arguing at all. I'm simply correcting the detail that no one is capitalizing Yao's facial expressions:)
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:42:50
He's a funny guy!
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:06:09
Seems easier to just click through to the creator's Patreon account and pay with fiat. I'm not sure many people will want to install a browser extension that does nothing except spending your money. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:55:28
What sub do you view as a better alternative? r/btc?
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:57:50


It's mainly because not a lot of people know about the blackhat side of him. I learned this info today and just thought he was just a cool guy before. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:09:07
Huh. What's up with this sub right now? A lot of doubt and negativity in the comments of a pro Bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:20:17
That makes sense.
@_date: 2016-12-11 03:31:23
Fair enough. I guess we came to a consensus. 
I mean, we're in r/Bitcoin. Very few here will actually like MSM with how they treat Bitcoin, calling dead every other month.
However, I must say that there is a lot of worrying evidence with the whole pizzagate situation. Believe it, don't believe it - Whatever. I just don't think it should be dismissed so fast.
@_date: 2016-12-10 20:55:43
I saw multiple pictures from that fake police line thing. What a joke.
Sometimes I like to think that the reporters are just innocents and they are unaware of how shady MSM really is, but this destroys that thought. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:17:19
Thanks for mentioning that. I had to do some research, [but found some interesting things](
All of this information is from his Wikipedia page under Legal Investigations.
1. In 1994, he was arrested by German police for trafficking in stolen phone calling card numbers.
2. As a teenager, Schmitz acquired a reputation in his native Germany after having claimed to have bypassed the security of NASA, the Pentagon and Citibank under the name of Kimble [...]  He also claimed to have hacked corporate PBX systems in the United States and said he was selling the access codes at $200 each
3. In 2001, Schmitz bought €375,000 worth of shares of the nearly bankrupt company Letsbuyit.com (de) and subsequently **announced his intention to invest €50 million in the company**.[35] The announcement caused the share value of Letsbuyit.com to jump[36] and Schmitz **cashed out, making a profit of €1.5 million**. 
4.  Dotcom moved to Thailand to avoid investigation where he was subsequently arrested on behalf of German authorities. He was deported back to Germany where he pleaded guilty to embezzlement 
5. Dotcom found Hong Kong to his liking and registered Kimpire Limited in December 2003, soon after moving there. He set up a network of interlinked companies, including Trendax, which he claimed was an artificial intelligence-driven hedge fund that delivered an annual return of at least 25%.[39] However, Trendax was never registered with Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission and the company **was legally not allowed to accept investments** or to conduct trades
Let me know if i missed anything.

Thanks for posting this. I nearly forgot about Ross unfortunately. I made a donation to his defense fund. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:56:58
Already is if you can somehow acquire one.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:29:26
That's not really a sketchy reason that would make someone hate him though. Unless you REALLY despise anything to do with Call of Duty, haha.
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:53:49


She said she was at the scene of the crime. She wasn't.
No idea why you're defending them. I don't care if you voted for Trump, Clinton, or Godzilla. Be honest, it's sketchy.
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:33:16
Yep. And let's be honest. The internet is not the only way to get drugs. If the daughter couldn't get them online, you can just go to the sketchy dude at school to make a transaction. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 03:13:53
You're missing the point, friend. 
Nobody is saying the crime itself was fake. (At least I haven't heard that. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't know much about the crime.)
What is fake is the reporter deliberately saying that she's at a crime scene when she's not. It's a fake crime scene. Journalism is supposed to be about truth and they're pulling acts like this.
The reporter could've simply said "We weren't allowed close to the crime scene --- etc". If there were any other TV reporters around, I'm sure that's exactly what they did.
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:48:33
It's clearly deceiving. I mean even the vice president of communications at ABC News didn't defend it and called it unacceptable. And it's not like ABC made this one mistake and learned their lesson. They did the same exact thing with their fake reservation list for an exclusive restaurant. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:09:03
I couldn't stand when in court they had a family telling the story of their daughter overdosing on heroin and blaming the whole incident on Ross. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 16:06:15
Except for CNN. They're the only reliable source of journalism nowadays. 
Edit: Trolling.

What kind of customers are you targeting? This is probably an obvious question but what kind of people want custom currency  notes?
@_date: 2016-09-29 23:23:26
Seems Genesis is legit according to it. I assumed there were a lot of ponzis
@_date: 2016-09-26 00:37:11
Interesting. Have you actually had people pay £1,000.00. I have a lot to learn about cryptocurrency, but I'm having a hard time grasping why someone would pay that much for a note design.
@_date: 2016-09-29 20:14:40
Really good idea! 
I have no idea how to use PGP, so I think I'm going to use Veracrypt instead.
@_date: 2016-09-01 17:27:40
Wow this got a lot of upvotes. Good traffic for you :)
@_date: 2016-09-30 15:26:02
I have to learn more about PGP especially if you say snowden used it.
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:19:57
Gotcha. 
So a way to look at it is an exchange is kind of like eBay, where users  can price products (Cryptocurrency) at whatever price they want. 
Does that mean that the data on the graph is an average of what coins are selling for on their exchange?
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:53:44
I mean the data displayed on the price graph that is shown. 
Since the coin sells at all different prices on an exchange and the price is determined by the users, wouldn't the graph show the average price the coin is selling at?
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:14:50
Thanks! So, the amount of Bitcoin available right now can be calculated mathematically (and accurately) through a formula?
@_date: 2016-10-01 19:21:37
The browser has a pretty sweet logo I gotta say.
@_date: 2016-10-01 20:35:37
Oh ok. Makes sense.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:22:35
):( - Which side is the smile and which side is the unibrow? You'll never know!
@_date: 2016-05-14 23:13:53
Don't you still need a credit/debit card to purchase the Bitcoin though?
