If true the difficulty level will drop and mining will become relatively more decentralized, at least for awhile. But who knows how true it is, and what would be the legal basis for it? Mining is just mathematics -- a hash algorithm. Maybe bitcoin miners will no longer be eligible for subsidized electricity rates.

No. Each bitcoin is earned by doing the real and increasingly expensive and difficult work of registering data immutably on the bitcoin blockchain. That immutability gives an earned bitcoin its market value. The fact that a limit of 21 million bitcoins was established from the start does *not* make them a creation by fiat. But you can say that the *limitation* of 21 million was established by fiat, as indeed it was. In theory, that limitation could be changed, but only by community consensus. Good luck on that!

That's a good rule to follow on a day to day basis and to ignore the news stories about "uncertainty" over this or that being the cause of a drop, but it is wrong to automatically assume there never is a connection. Sometimes there clearly is. Bitcoin began to fall practically as soon as the Fed chairman opened his mouth testifying about the dangers of Libra. I would have thought the price would have gone up and indeed down when Libra was first announced. In any case, Libra is going to be litigated and studied and compromised to death. You can't change the system from within. Only from without, and that is where Bitcoin is --- and will be.

Grandma and Grandpa will have the fear of God put into them when Bitcoin crashes again for awhile. All weak hands will be shaken out. But because of Bitcoin's underlying utility -- decentralized, economical, fast, inexpensive, and immutable data registration -- it will always pick itself up, dust itself off, and start all over again. 
"Yes, it’s still a dumb investment. In fact, dumber than ever" Hitzik writes, and then says "Investors who bought in before, say, midyear 2017 have made so much money in the market that they could weather a crash of even 40% and still be in the black."
Doesn't sound much like a dumb investment, does it? Especially when Hiltzik also wrote "One day in 2013, when the price of bitcoin had crashed to $600 from $1,200 in a matter of hours, I wrote that this showed that the virtual currency was a dumb investment."

As noted below, use your phrase in the  generator. 
Be advised that Receive and Change addresses exist on two separate "paths" in an HD wallet using BIP44... They are more correctly known as "External" and "Internal". External being the receive addresses which are used for sending and receiving coins from external sources... and Internal are the change addresses which should only ever be used internally by the wallet for catching change amounts from transactions.
On the BIP39 Mnemonic Code Convertor ( - use offline copy etc)... if you put your 12 word recovery phrase in... by default it will use BIP44 with the derivation path m/44'/0'/0'/0, that shows "External" (aka Receive) addresses... set the External/Internal value to 1 (derivation path: m/44'/0'/0'/1) and you will get "Internal" (aka Change addresses).

Bitcoin, being a system of decentralized and transparent immutable data-registration, is potentially one of the most productive innovations ever devised.


Of course, the demand for energy *is* highly discretionary and that discretion is registered in the *price* for energy, which changes all the time.


I am claiming that residential, industrial, commercial energy demand is clearly discretionary. (All energy certainly cannot be renewable.) There is no need to eat raw meat, however.

Bitcoin is no worse for the environment than electrical cars are or anything else electrical, including the electrical signs in Times Square and Las Vegas. The premise that bitcoins are bad for the environment is premised on the assumption that they are useless and thus a *waste* of electricity.

It's revolutionary and it will certainly save more electricity than it burns.

The longer BTC gets slower and more expensive the faster BCH will grow. BTC's only hope at this point is SegWit and the LN.

"Bitcoins sit among twisted copper wiring inside a communications room at an office in this arranged photograph in London." In reading that caption, I got the distinct feeling that the editor who wrote it believes the "coins" are real things. 
As for the state of supply of bitcoins, the author seems unaware that that no matter how many miners or how few get in the game, the last one will not be mined until around 2140. 
There are currently over 1300 altcoins in existence. Most of their tokens have essentially zero value. They have had no effect on the market because none of them offer a way to scale up -- they're useless and treated as such. The two recent bitcoin hard-forks, by contrast, have significant market value because they offer modifications to the bitcoin protocol that at least partially address matters of scale, cost, wait-times, and mining centralization. Others are in the pipeline. All of their code will be open-sourced and spell out exactly what they will do and not do. 
If capital markets want to jump into bitcoin, fine. The price will go up but that will not increase the supply of bitcoins. It will probably increase the number of ICOs, hardforks, and altcoins. But it won't take long for people to learn not to trust them before their code goes public.

The author of this piece is described as a meteorologist. He might try studying economics, especially if he writes for the *Wall Street Journal*. Consider this howler:
"Today, each bitcoin transaction requires the same amount of energy used to power nine homes in the U.S. for one day." 
*Really?* One *transaction*? Or is it to *mine* one bitcoin within a certain period of time? Say, where do these figures actually come from anyway? 
Regardless, "That sort of electricity use is pulling energy from grids all over the world, where it could be charging electric vehicles and powering homes, to bitcoin-mining farms.
He forgot to mention that bitcoin-mining farms must also be pulling energy from electric signs in Times Square and Las Vegas. And Super Bowl and World Series games. (Or maybe he didn't forget.) Say, how do we allocate resources anyway? Isn't it by at least a limited free market? Aren't profits a part of free markets? What this non-economist meteorologist who writes for Slate and the Wall Street Journal presumably means is that bitcoin is now so *profitable* that bitcoin miners can afford to buy that sort of electricity. 
"In Venezuela, where rampant hyperinflation and subsidized electricity has led to a boom in bitcoin mining, rogue operations are now occasionally causing blackouts across the country."
So *that's* what's causing Venezuela's blackouts! It's those greedy rogue bitcoin miners! 
"The world’s largest bitcoin mines are in China, where they siphon energy from huge hydroelectric dams, some of the cheapest sources of carbon-free energy in the world."
Siphoning? No, *buying*. 
"And with the climate conscious racing to replace fossil fuel-base plants with renewable energy sources, new stress on the grid means more facilities using dirty technologies."
Actually, wouldn't a good test of the sustainability and cost-practicality of "renewable energy sources" be how well they can power bitcoin miners instead of cities? As I kind of test, I mean. Before we dismantle our "dirty" conventional power plants. One might think so, if one thought about it.

". . .  BoA’s CTO Kathy Bessant said that cryptocurrencies are 'designed to be not transparent' and thus hinder banks’ attempts to catch 'bad guys . . . As a payment system, I think it's troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort, in fact \[it's\] designed to be not transparent,' she told the program, 'The way we sort of quote\-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that,' she added.
Now this is quite interesting. I can accept that the BofA bans the purchase of stocks and currencies in general using their credit card. It's probably a good policy, because a lot of people would stack up debts they couldn't pay back. But her reasoning regarding cryptos to back up that policy is nonsense. Either she genuinely does not know that all Bitcoin transactions are public, or she does know and is simply lying, presumably to keep her Charlie Munger\-like bosses happy. Neither explanation is a good one. But also, think back to the long mortgage\-lending swindle that culminated in 2008. What was transparent about that? And who were the bad guys then?
Just another example of how far banks have got to go. They can't even back up a reasonable policy \-\- banning credit card purchases of a volatile commodity \-\- with an informed statement.

The second guy says that he is happy to invest in industries that service the field, but that Bitcoin will "lose its legitimacy" as central banks regulate it.  He doesn't say how that can be done, and why it needs regulation at all. Is it too volatile? Volatility is good for one party in a transaction, and they won't complain. Volatility tends to smooth out gains and loses over time. Or maybe it's the dark web? Why not just try to regulate *it?*  You'd get just as far.
One gets the feeling that he thinks Bitcoin itself can be regulated, even though it is really based on nothing but SHA\-256, a public hashing\-algorithm written by the NSA. In reality, the only regulation that can occur in democratic countries is to regulate the exchanges \(already done\) and assess higher taxes on miners using subsidized electricity. But the exchanges will eventually be replaced by P2P trading through ethereum smart\-contracts \(and possibly the Augur system\), and bitcoin mining will gradually need less and less raw power burned in huge server farms as the mining technology progresses and changes \(like Bitcoin Gold\). Bitcoin itself, in any constitutional democracy, cannot be touched without changing the fundamental principles of freedom of information.

I think it would, because immutable data\-registration and the changes it will force in copyright and trademark protection, and turning everyone into their own notary public, is definitely a form of production. You are producing vastly more secure intellectual property. But neither he nor Unger know this. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:45:55
The coins *are* the tech, they are integral components of each other. In "permissioned" (private) blockchains (such as the kind various enterprises like banks are working on), there are no coins as such. So the immutability is only as good as the centralized encryption --- they are not necessarily using competitive SHA-256 difficulty levels as the basis of the strength of their blockchains. Recently, a finance company worked a deal using their own blockchain -- but then registered it one more time on the Ethereum blockchain as a kind of public legal notice. (The Financial Times did a story about this last week, but it's behind their paywall.) Bitcoin and Ethereum offer rewards using their own currency to miners who do the work of finding a hash output that meets the current difficulty level. The utility of those blockchains in registering data immutably (using SHA-256) is what gives bitcoins and ethers their market value. This is what Buffet, Munger, and even Gates have missed. They say Bitcoin has "no intrinsic value." But it does: immutable data registration. And immutable data registration is what private (permissioned) blockchains do not have, which is why the company in the FT story took the final step of registering their deal on Ethereum. When people like Buffet say they admire blockchain technology but not Bitcoin, they are missing the whole point. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:11:23
Buffet still does not know that Bitcoin and the other leading cryptos each provide a method of immutable data\-registration. Something as basic as that and neither he nor his business partner Charlie Munger have heard of it \-\-\- presumably because their staffs haven't told them, presumably because their staffs haven't heard of it either.

@_date: 2018-05-03 15:38:18
Buffet has an active mind and personality. I'd say that his partner Charlie Munger is old. He has dismissed Bitcoin as "disgusting", which shows he understands absolutely nothing about it at all, and doesn't know that understands absolutely nothing about it at all.

@_date: 2018-05-07 16:17:34
Buffet has long been technically incorrect when he said, again and again, that Bitcoin is a non\-producing asset. But it *is* a producing asset. It produces immutably registered data online in a decentralized, economical, and sustainable way. He still doesn't know, after all this time, that Bitcoin allows everyone to be their own notary public, and that because of it Bitcoin and Ethereum will radically strengthen intellectual property rights. Munger, his partner, is even worse. He actually called Bitcoin "disgusting" and spoke of it in terms of "selling babies' brains" \([
Here is a case of two putative thought\-leaders of the financial world who do not know even the most aspect of the Bitcoin financial system, which is that of immutable data\-registration.  Bill Gates also doesn't know it \([ So they think it is a non\-producing asset.  They have not bothered to find out otherwise, and neither have their staffs. That says something, and it isn't good.

So once again, Bitcoin "lacks intrinsic value," Buffet says, adding "If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don't have anything that is producing anything."
He's wrong. Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum provide a method of immutable data\-registration, potentially turning everyone into their own notary public. This is huge. It will revolutionize copyright and trademark law and everything else that requires accurate data registration that cannot be altered. If that isn't "producing anything" what is? Buffet and his partner Charlie Munger are clearly unaware of this vital and basic function. Equally clearly, their staffs don't know either. That says something and it isn't good. Imagine two of the country's most wealthy men being so basically ignorant about something that will change how business and law is done around the world!

Too high to take a flyer on like you could have when bitcoins were a fraction of a penny. I wonder what that market you describe is thinking. The SEC is charged with protecting consumers and the greatest number of them. The number of newly arriving consumers who could (at least in theory) be hurt by unforeseen and unintended dangers of an approved ETF could be far higher than the much smaller number of consumers who will be hurt by the known and intended dangers of the current Wild West bitcoin frontier.  I'd like to see the SEC approve the ETF and think that it should, but if (when) it doesn't, I don't see the market collapsing. Litecoin miners will likely approve SegWit first (see  Only then will bitcoin miners follow suit. After that dust has settled look for an ETF. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:29:34
No one knows for sure approval is coming. The SEC itself might not know yet. If anything, rejection of the ETF is priced in, since that seems to be the most likely outcome. 
The SEC is charged with protecting consumers. Its problem here is that if it approves the ETF,  it will bring in a lot more bitcoin users but expose them to possible unforeseen dangers. If they do not approve the ETF,  then there will be fewer consumers but they will be exposed to the very real and greater dangers of a Wild West marketplace.

I think Bitcoin is so new that it still transcends political affiliation. In effect, it's apolitical. I suppose in theory that a Republican economist should be more on the side of the banks, but then again not necessarily because Republicans tend to oppose regulation and banks are highly regulated. As for the Democrat, the Bitcoin ETF would in effect create a regulated bitcoin exchange. Probably both sides could agree that that is not a bad thing in and of itself, and might even be a good thing.

Roubini is either fundamentally ignorant of the Bitcoin system or is deliberately lying. I think it is the former. He claims that "cartelization" of mining in China erodes security. This is not true. Miners must follow the bitcoin protocol strictly. If they don't their numbers won't be accepted -- they won't work in the bitcoin blockchain. This is so elementary that I can only conclude that Roubini. like Buffett and Munger, simply does not want to learn. Their minds are closed.
He actually claims that Bitcoin's recent high fees (which have since dropped substantially) are the result of oligarchies deliberately manipulating the system.
His description of what a private and permissioned blockchain is actually fits his description of  what he thinks the "oligarchies" of Chinese miners on the public Bitcoin blockchain are -- capable of changing transactions to suit their purposes, approving some transactions and not others, etc. 
I don't doubt Roubini's expertise in the mainstream financial world, but when it comes to blockchains he simply does not know what he is talking about.

Governments won't ban bitcoin because its blockchain will be way too useful and has the potential to save them *lots* of money. Also: what would be the constitutional basis for such a ban? "Hashing data with an ASIC computer at a rate higher than *x* shall be punishable by . . . " As for its use a currency, to ban it would be to ban bartering itself, because, since bitcoin isn't really a currency properly speaking, people are simply trading goods and services for it. Governments are concerned about tools that increase crime and tax evasion. Given bitcoin's public nature, it is more likely that gov'ts will eventually decide to stop producing cash, like India has done in part. But again, I doubt even North Korea could declare that hashing data is illegal. What it and other gov'ts could do is tax electricity consumption to get a piece of the pie.

Mining centralization could be the result of geographical proximity but it could also take place around the world by miners forming a conspiracy. People think all the miners in China are under the gov'ts thumb, but that is not the case today and is unlikely to be the case in the future and forming such a cabal would require funding from the gov't. Why would it do that? 
In a way, the bitcoin network is itself a tight centralization, everyone following exactly the same protocol. Anyone who attempts to fight that centralization can simply fork if they think their protocol is superior. Contrary to what Roubini says, such forks do not dilute Bitcoin in the least. Each fork has its own blockchain and its own work to do. Bitcoin has the longest blockchain and does the most work today. That might change. But it also might not. Bitcoin might change itself instead, kind of like how Ethereum is changing itself right now.

It will? Casual users have never heard of either SegWit or LN, and most hodlers -- like me -- will hodl anyway. The most likely outcome will be the realization that bitcoin's killer app will be data registration because it does not require instant confirmation.

The reporter presents "blockchain" in terms of a public blockchain, seemingly unaware that presumably at least some if not most of the DLT technology proposed by Silicon Valley would be permissioned blockchains. (One wonders how many hucksters themselves are aware of the difference.) The failure to make this distinction reflects where DLT stands in our culture today: barely noticed.
Skepticism is surely advised. The story makes a good point about fraud and the lack of transparency in carbon-cap markets, and this is likely a good use for public DLT. But the truth is, if people really want to clean up the environment, they really need only eat fewer animals. Don't know how DLT can help things there.

Buffet wasn't really talking about bitcoin transactions. He was talking about bitcoins themselves: ". . . Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? . . . The idea that [a bitcoin] has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view."  I should add that I'm not aware that anyone has seriously argued that bitcoins themselves have intrinsic value. That was always a straw man. Of course, they do not have intrinsic value. Either does paper money except as bookmarks and kindling. I respect Buffet's policy of not investing in things he knows nothing about, but I do wonder why he does not understand the first thing about bitcoin: that it is a method of immutable data-registration, and that to use that function you have to buy a non-counterfeitable crypto-token called a "bitcoin" that is (like gold) expensive and arduous to find. It is the utility of the bitcoin blockchain that gives bitcoins their value. That alone and nothing else. I suspect if Buffet knew this, he would own some and invest in the mining of them. I also suspect that he will, soon enough, do both.

Here are two howlers from this press release: 
"There’s no specific use for bitcoin." So here is yet another great (if not greater) fool who knows nothing of the whole point of the bitcoin protocol: the use of its blockchain to provide fast and cost-effective immutable data-registration.
"If the SEC closes the door on new ICOs simply ducking stock offering requirements, it could severely curtail the business. That would dent demand for bitcoin, and leave bitcoin owners relying on internet pirates, crooks, and the greater fool theory to keep the valuation at current lofty levels or even higher." I would think that severely curtailing ICO would *increase* the demand for bitcoin, and I would think that would be obvious. As for "pirates, crooks, and great[er] fools," they are the ones who *don't* want a system of immutable data-registration. Alt-coins and alt-coin ICO's are their playground, and the author of this come-on for a conference does not seem to know the difference between them and bitcoin.

The story I read (from CBS) does point out that there is no agreement regarding this matter, and that knowledgeable people have disputed it. What these studies fail to mention or emphasize is that bitcoin miners *buy* the electricity they use. The question is whether they buy it at market rates or subsidized ones. Subsidized rates of anything leads to waste, and the issue here is waste. Nobody is talking about curtailing electric signs that advertise tobacco, alcohol, candy, fast food, gambling, sports, etc. That's because those signs more often than not burn electricity paid for at the  prevailing market rate. That's all this really comes down to. Except in the cases of the distribution of food to starving refugees and similar situations, where commodities are subsidized they are wasted. The issue is waste and that is all it is.

The authors may be professors but I suspect they are of the Professor Bitcorn variety. If the Chinese aggressively moved to shut down their bitcoin miners, the overall network difficulty level would fall commensurately, thus pricing in miners around the world who had earlier been priced out. The network would percolate right along and even be stronger than ever for the increased decentralization outside China. The gov't could require miners to pay full market price instead of the subsidized rate that encouraged mining there in the first place. But for an avowedly socialist/communist gov't, that would be anathema and open the door to a big problem -- paying full price would entitle miners to a degree of independence and indeed power. No way could that be tolerated. So to compel miners to do its bidding, the gov't would have to subsidize them! I wonder what the incentive would be for subsidized miners to keep upgrading their ASIC chips.

I keep reading that there are Chinese miners whose output is about 5% of the total network, and that they have proclaimed themselves against SegWit and will not implement it, thus forestalling or barring (if they last long enough) SegWit altogether. Stop me if this has already been talked about *ad infinitum*, but it seems to me that should SegWit quickly enough get even close to the required amount of miners needed -- or even half as many -- the *speed* of that partial adoption could or would attract a lot of new miners and the threshold would be overcome relatively quickly. Speed could bring a new critical mass.

"Confidentiality is the big killer here; banks don't want their data touching public anything, even if it's encrypted." 
But they could hash their data while adding a secret nonce to it and then register that hash on the bitcoin blockchain by using it to create a brainwallet address and sending a fraction of bitcoin to it. They then could label that address, identifying it as being the hash of a given spreadsheet, etc. Now they have something that their internal data could always be compared to. If somebody messes with that data, the new hash would not match the registered one. If you ask me, data registration like that will be bitcoin's killer app.

It's clear that Mr. Rometty is a well-meaning n00b on the subject of blockchains. For one thing, he (and the headline-writer) use "blockchain" without the definite article and I'm not sure that has yet established itself as standard usage -- correct me if I'm wrong. Second, he says ". . . encryption ensures that the [chain of transactions] remains unbroken . . ." No. Each transaction is a mathematical hash, which is not the same thing as encryption. Third, he writes "Blockchain offers a solution: a trusted, immutable, digital ledger . . ." That, whether he knows it or not, describes a private or consortium blockchain (see  by Vitalik Buterin) which will *not* be immutable. Rometty seems unaware that *trusted* is actually a technical term and is not necessarily better than trustless, which *is* immutable. He then goes on to cite the example of Visa and Docusign's efforts to design a new way to rent or lease or buy a car. But that effort (as of a year ago anyway -- see  is based on the trustless Bitcoin blockchain, something else he seems unaware of. 
Mr. Rometty writes: ". . . the [blockchain] technology needs a system of transparent governance . . . " seemingly unaware that *Bitcoin's* technology already has exactly just that. 
Finally, not everyone agrees that *trusted* blockchains are necessarily better than conventional databases and I'm not sure that Mr. Rometty is aware of that either. 
Still, the article is a straw in the wind. More to come!

Of course, a centralized database can be *changed*. A bitcoin blockchain transaction cannot be. You seem to be arguing that Bitcoin has a limited capacity and that satoshi-level transactions must be discouraged through social pressure (since there is no central authority to limit them). But if the fee is sufficient, who cares whether the value of the transaction itself is low? The miners would make their money. Remember that the amount sent must be too low for others  to retrieve -- it has to be lower than the fee. And if fees are bid up by the increase in transactions, well then, wouldn't that be further incentive to scale the system through innovations like SegWit? 
The app can avoid this problem another way if you like: you would make a substantial-enough deposit to it, and the entire amount would be sent with adequate fee to a given data-generated brain-wallet address -- and then immediately retrieved (with fee again) and sent back to the app. Such transactions would be indistinguishable from normal, higher-value transactions, and thus could not be considered spam. Right? And anyway, these transactions by definition are not spam because they would be genuinely useful -- you are registering data that you may need to be confirmed.

As I understand it, the IRS considers bitcoins to be property and not currency. I would imagine that they will discover that those who bought and held will owe normal property appreciation taxes *if and when* they sell. So those people may get notices to that effect. But many others will have sent their money to other addresses and perhaps used a mixer as well. So the IRS may ask those people what they got in exchange for their b/c. I suppose you could point to a painting you bought for a dollar at a flea market and say: "*That* -- I thought it was a Matisse." If enough people do that, expect new regulations requiring that goods or services obtained by selling bitcoins have full documented provenance and that the trade be "reasonably" equitable in value.  No point in blaming the IRS though -- it just does what Congress gives it the authority to do.

The stability of ice\-cream pricing would seem to be a challenge to Bitcoin as a point\-of\-sale currency. Maybe Bitcoin will solve that problem by forming a new kind of futures\-market, one that is transacted entirely in retail point\-of\-sale networks and enforced by ethereum smart\-contracts. In other words, by handing out an ice\-cream cone to a kid for a price less than the cone cost to make, the retailer gets the right to sell one by a certain date for a good margin more than the cone cost to make. He in turn can sell that right, etc. That right could be bundled, pooled, securitized, etc., like home mortgages have been for years \(and still are\). It might also be modifiable. Eventually all pricing might be done this way. Fiat would, by comparison, seem as crude and simplistic as wampum.

In which case migrants may rely on (to reiterate) a hybrid network of Hawala middlemen taking and paying cash while utilizing bitcoin-transmitting ethereum smart contracts.

I'm no accountant, but I would expect that since bitcoins are property in the eyes of the IRS, you *would* be able to have that loss factored into your taxes, not *might*.
But I'm thinking that a bitcoin address known by the IRS to belong to someone could still be used tax-free. You supply the bitcoins and give your heirs the secret key. They wait until you die. After the rest of your estate is settled, your heirs have access to the address and can use it tax free, as long as they keep their mouths shut. Who can stop them, especially if they use a mixer?

Update on the HTC blockchain phone. Interesting, but the presenter, Michael Del Castillo, seems oddly uninformed about some crypto basics. For example, he seems to think that cold storage automatically requires a third party “cold storage facility” and that this centralizes what is supposed to be a decentralized protocol. Of course, you don’t need a third party. A thumb drive in safe-deposit box will do perfectly well. The phone/wallet itself seems to be a multi-sig arrangement, which allows trusted parties (individuals) to give the phone the permission needed to use the private key (or phone password? -- Castillo uses the two terms interchangeably at one point) that you have forgotten. He says that private keys are “very difficult to memorize” (putting it mildly) but never mentions a wallet’s word-seed and doesn’t mention if the HTC phone stores a word-seed. Word-seeds, of course, are fairly easy to memorize (if you only use one wallet, that is) -- the newest Trezor only uses twelve words as opposed to the twenty-four other wallets use. Castillo mentions software wallets but not hardware ones. What would be great is a phone that hardware wallets can plug into. (I’m not sure you can do that yet with a Trezor.) Altogether probably a good development, but I never would use it save for small amounts.

This is a service that offers data-registration on multiple public blockchains. The idea seems to be that redundancy will provide greater security than private, permissioned blockchains:
"Because permissioned ledgers are centralized to a certain extent in that several participants or actors within the network have more power than others, there would be minimal difference in integrating advanced encryption methods and cryptographic systems into existing database technologies [compared to] implementing permissioned blockchain networks."
He adds that: 
"At the current stage, it would not be possible for public blockchain networks to process massive amounts of data at the level of centralized platforms such as Visa and PayPal. However, it is also impractical to peg each piece of data to a blockchain network and transactions. Companies could possibly look into pegging chunks of data into the bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic blockchains through startups like Stampery."
Isn't this a misunderstanding of how public blockchains like bitcoin work? A company could encrypt their databases as always -- not bother with a permissioned blockchain at all -- and hash hundreds or thousands or millions of such collections -- or individual transactions -- into one single hash, which could then be used to create a bitcoin address. They would then send a fraction of a bitcoin to that address. Within minutes it will be incorporated into the blockchain. That address could then be publically labeled. Sure, you could register the same hash on the litecoin and ethereum blockchains, but why bother? Such redundancy might look good for PR purposes but would serve no effective purpose. And there would really be no need to use a third party like Stampery. Companies could easily learn to do it themselves. 
Services like Stampery might be a good introduction to companies and individuals who don't know how to use cryptocurrencies themselves and don't have the time or inclination to learn. But eventually everyone will surely just do it themselves.

This article reveals a typical core-sampling of ‘expert’ opinion regarding bitcoin.
Peter Mallouk writes that “There are so many types of virtual currencies — like litecoin, ethereum, ripple and, of course, bitcoin — that "there's no way that even a fraction of them can survive."  But litecoin, ethereum, ripple, and bitcoin *are* a fraction of the many types of virtual currencies that have already died – indeed were stillborn for any practical purpose and have had no impact on those that have survived: litecoin, ethereum, ripple, and – of course – bitcoin.
Having said that he goes on to say "Is it possible that maybe one or two will work out in the future? Sure it is." But then adds “. . . in the meantime, "if you buy cryptocurrency, you get no income. It's not a real investment. It's speculation."
Mallouk knows that speculators make money, sometimes a lot of money. One of the reasons for that is that they (sometimes) earn no compensation before cashing out. In other words, the risk they took in not earning dividends and yields is compensated for if and when their initial buy-in pays off. But as a practical matter the distinction between “speculation” and “investment” is academic. Taking stock options instead of higher pay is a form of speculation. And many stocks pay no dividends or very small ones, and bonds often yield very little – depending, of course, on how risky – speculative – such bonds are. As for real estate which Mallouk also recommends, the rent you earn is proportionate to the cost of owning that real estate – unless you speculate and buy land that has low value now but may have high value later. In the interim, you may not earn any rent or rent so low it won’t pay for your investment for years.
Mallouk then makes the usual nod to “blockchain technology” but adds “that doesn't mean that bitcoin is going to work out or ripple is going to work out.” He then obliviously states “Palm and Blackberry were fantastic, but Apple came in and took them out. Lycos and Excite were here before Google,” clearly unaware that Bitcoin and Ripple and (Ethereum) may be the Apples and Googles of the financial world.
Jim Cramer unsurprisingly gets it wrong as well. Bitcoin is a “pure gamble” and "kind of like Monopoly money [showing he has no understanding of, or possibly any knowledge of, mining]. It's just pure gambling at this point. I mean, if you want to gamble, go to Vegas. Vegas is fabulous.”
To quote Edgar Allen Poe, “Observe, here, the laughable confusion of thought!" If bitcoin is pure gambling, you clearly don’t need to go to Vegas to gamble. But worse – and this from a financial adviser (of sorts), Cramer is saying that you should not take the money a trip to Vegas would cost and put it into Bitcoin instead. That’s pretty bad. You should put it into bitcoin instead.
As for Dimon’s comments, they have been largely superseded by Dimon himself.
Regarding all this I will paraphrase the old Chinese saying and state that It’s earlier than you think.

"[The blockchain] also self-checks and self-repairs . . .  Because the blockchain is constantly checking itself, the data on it is immutable. Even if a hacker did somehow manage to break into a block, any changes they made would be immediately and permanently visible."
Uh, no. The blockchain does not constantly check itself. All it cares about is the longest chain. The longest one is taken to be the correct one. A hacker cannot make any changes along the blockchain without also needing to re-do the hashes of all subsequent blocks.

Articles like this usually have at least one technical error in them, like this:
“And if the government of China or the US decide bitcoin is a threat to civil society with its electricity usage, it’s not going to survive,” Bonneau says. “You can run an underground cryptocurrency, but not one that burns a gigawatt of electricity. Producing a gigawatt cannot be done in secret.”
Actually, if gov'ts tried to suppress mining (probably via high taxes, fees, licenses, etc., there being no way constitutionally -- even in China -- to stop people from running a hash algorithm on their own computers will electricity they pay for themselves) the difficulty level would simply fall. Small-time miners priced out by the mega-farms would be priced back in all around the world. And each burning much less electricity -- that they would be paying for themselves.
But the article does contain a bit of common sense: "The market doesn’t really care about fancy research papers,” says Joseph Bonneau, a cryptocurrency researcher at New York University. “Ultimately I think it’ll be economic in the end. As long as there is demand for bitcoin and a proof-of-work blockchain, people will show up to mine it.”
Show up to mine it with electricity they pay for themselves

No, it's no longer a global currency, but not because of its high mining cost.

Blockchain.info is *not* a hot wallet. You have access to the private keys and they do not keep your password. You can protect your own local access with a Yubikey and email notification requiring your approval. You can restore your wallet with the 12-word recovery phrase. I would rather use blockchain.info than a hardware wallet, which can be broken. Ultimately, no matter what kind of wallet you have, to use your bitcoins requires logging onto the web through your browser and inputting your bitcoin data. This is true even with offline transactions. *Stop calling blockchain.info a hot wallet.* A hot wallet is an account with an exchange in which you have no access to the private keys and the exchange stores your password.

[In early 2013] "Klein decided to buy $100 worth. Poking around, he found few easy options for purchasing the tokens and ended up mailing off a money order to an exchange based in Atlanta."
That is a strange comment to me. I began buying in 2011 and never would have considered sending a money order to anyone. I linked my bank account with Dwolla and then sent the money from Dwolla to the exchange (I think it was Bitstamp). In 2013 Dwolla stopped facilitating bitcoin transactions, but by then Coinbase was available. Sending money through the mail never was necessary. I actually made my first single bitcoin transaction through a forum, and sent the money via Paypal.

How can a cryptocurrency be "backed" by oil? Can a holder of a Petro demand a measure of oil at a bank, gas station, or oil refinery in exchange for it?

This Bloomberg fellow is a businessman who clearly fears that cryptos will disrupt his own buzzword-based business of sorts (intellyx.com) so in total desperation he proposes that bitcoin mining be banned, focusing on the alleged threat that illicit browser-based mining poses. This is a tiny threat overall and will likely stay that way because increasingly people will specifically give permission to legitimate browser-miners to block ads. So the parasitical miners, who can offer no such trade-off, will be squeezed out. But more importantly, there is no way under a constitutional form of government that bitcoin mining *itself* could be declared illegal. It's just mathematics, specifically hashing using SHA-256, developed by the NSA. Nor can it be declared illegal to barter the results of such mining -- bitcoins -- for goods and services. And Bitcoin is a world-wide decentralized protocol. How would it be banned -- through the U.N. and Intrapol? I can think of only two places dystopic enough to ban bitcoin mining among its own people: North Korea and Cuba -- the latter because the people there are simply too poor. 
Bloomberg reminds me of those who used to oppose pay cable-TV because it would replace 'free' commercial TV. They used to run ads that were the dumbo equivalent to this article.

Sure was. I think the gov't could have accomplished its end by just announcing that the printing plates for the notes were being destroyed and no others would be printed. People immediately would have begun hoarding them, effectively removing them from circulation.

@_date: 2018-11-05 20:43:44
Articles like this usually have at least on technical error in them, like this:
“And if the government of China or the US decide bitcoin is a threat to civil society with its electricity usage, it’s not going to survive,” Bonneau says. “You can run an underground cryptocurrency, but not one that burns a gigawatt of electricity. Producing a gigawatt cannot be done in secret.”
Actually, if gov'ts tried to suppress mining (probably via high taxes, fees, licenses, etc., there being no way constitutionally -- even in China -- to stop people from running a hash algorithm on their own computers will electricity they pay for themselves) the difficulty level would simply fall. Small-time miners priced out by the mega-farms would be priced back in all around the world. And each burning much less electricity -- that they would be paying for themselves.
But the article does contain a bit of common sense: "The market doesn’t really care about fancy research papers,” says Joseph Bonneau, a cryptocurrency researcher at New York University. “Ultimately I think it’ll be economic in the end. As long as there is demand for bitcoin and a proof-of-work blockchain, people will show up to mine it.”
Show up to mine it with electricity they pay for themselves.

You are right about that, but I think such an arrangement would turn the Petro into a token -- directly useful for one thing only and having secondary trade value in the marketplace only for that reason. You could call the Petro a currency but it wouldn't really be one because the gov't could cancel it at any time if it didn't work or if it worked too well and began to displace the "real" government currency.

"Banning" bitcoin means banning the mining of bitcoin. That's going to be tough even for nation run by a communist party: "Thou shalt not hash data at a rate in excess of *x* GH/s." Such stupidity would never be countenanced. It would make more sense for China to end the subsidization of electricity for its miners. Anyone using more than *y* amount of electricity per hour would need a special exemption to get the reduced rate. But those who decided to pay the market rate would gain a measure of independence from the government, and true dictatorships cannot allow that. Saddam Hussein would not have allowed that. Nor would the Soviet Union. So China will keep the subsidies in place and regulate its exchanges. But suppose they become too popular, which they are likely to do? My expectation is that China will, as the pendulum swings, clamp down, liberalize, and clamp down again. Kind of like marijuana in the U.S. Under Nixon and Reagan there was a clampdown. Carter and Obama tried to liberalize. Now we're back to clamping down. And so it will go *ad infinitum.*

They could just eliminate electricity subsidies for miners (or anyone using more than a certain amount unless are granted entitlements). Which would probably lead to decentralized mining in China. Which presumably would be a good thing. But someone paying true market price would also gain a measure of independence from the government. Which cannot be allowed. Bitcoins also give a measure of independence from government. So . . . CHINA BAN BITCOIN! Which leads to decentralized mining. Which leads China to accept bitcoin. For awhile. Then . . .

Miners run each block of bitcoin transactions and a ten-digit "nonce" through a hash algorithm (SHA-256) as they search for the nonce that, in combination with the block, produces the required number of leading zeros in the hash output. Those zeros define the difficulty level of the system. The more miners there are, the more zeros are required. And the less, the fewer. Saying that miners "submit a flood of guesses" to a series of math problems is just as inaccurate as saying that mathematicians searching for the next higher prime number submit a flood of guesses to difficult math problems. Neither group is "guessing" anything. They are following a specific algorithm. Also, saying that miners are working on "math problems" implies that there is a centralized group of trusted mathematicians who are creating the math problems to be solved, and that such problems don't necessarily have anything to do with Bitcoin *per se* and so the work done is essentially arbitrary in nature. But in Bitcoin, the work done following the algorithm is the whole point of the system. Really, the "difficult math problems" involved in mining have already been solved: creating a hash algorithm that will never produce a "crash" -- a hash output that is the same for two different inputs. SHA-256 is the solution -- and it was created before Bitcoin was proposed in 2009.

He claims to have mined it back then, yet explains the mining-process this way: "Over time, all the transactions that people make get lumped into blocks and validated, and they get a special code that takes into account all the codes in the blocks that came before, and thus you have it: a blockchain."
Doesn't really sound like an ex-miner to me. Doesn't mention hashing or SHA-256.

2) "governments refuse to grant bitcoin any legitimacy" and 
3) "by the looks of it people aren't investing anymore." 
Regarding 1), with the possible exceptions of hermit dystopias like N. Korea, Vietnam, and maybe Cuba, *no* country is in a position to ban bitcoin for private or indeed public transactions because they are not in a position to ban bartering, private or public. Regarding 2), in California and several other states, bitcoin has officially been classified as legal and neither the federal government nor any state has banned it. Coinbase, the leading American exchange, is based in California, as is Kraken. As for 3), More people than ever are investing in bitcoin! Think of all the new miners popping up around the world. Think of the futures markets that been legalized in the U.S. and the ETFs being proposed. Arizona is on the brink of accepting bitcoins for tax payments.
Bitcoin is valuable because it is a protocol for immutable data registration. No government of laws can ban it. No corrupt official, public or private, can alter it. It does not require government funding or subsidies. It is here to stay!

Local transactions for awhile no doubt. But ultimately I think it comes down to the fact that bitcoin mining itself can't be banned because it is a transparent mathematical process using a public hash algorithm powered by electricity legally purchased. As long as there is a profit to be made from mining, people will mine them and sell them to those who want them. For this reason, bitcoin cannot be banned.

Another in a long line of perceived thought-leaders, presumed financial experts, suits, and talking heads who knew not the first thing they were trying to talk about. Has Smith even heard the phrase "immutable data registration"? I doubt it. He mentions the South Sea bubble and its governmental imprimatur and the dot-com one, ditto via the SEC. He neglects to mention the 2008 mortgage bubble, itself the product of an explicit government program to expand "home ownership" among people who could not, then and now, afford to buy one but were enabled to try anyway by going deeply into debt they could never repay. "Bitcoins generate no cash and have no investment value" he writes (doesn't that sound like gold?) which is an obvious lie and probably a deliberate one. (Bitcoin is down this year, but way up overall.) He mentions the multiplicity of alt-coins, but doesn't mention that the market ignores nearly all of them and always has. But Smith also misses a larger point: the South Sea and tulip bubbles were actually manias. The dot-com and mortgage were near-manias. But bitcoin? To this day, I have not to my knowledge met anyone other than myself who owns any. I've overheard it discussed in two bars (one in LA, the other in Philly) and that's about it. Contrast that with a brief pyramid scheme mania that roared briefly through LA years ago. I once went into a department store and couldn't get service at the cash register because the clerks were huddling over their own pyramid they were trying to get going. (Bitcoin is often called a ponzi but actually there is no point of comparison between bitcoin and ponzi-schemes because miners do not try to set up chains of other miners.)

That statement makes no sense. A perceived opportunity is effectively a prediction.

But if not enough people believe in the "opportunity" it will not exist. If TA really could find probabilities and asymmetric trading opportunities, the TA specialist who found them would of course keep them secret to profit from them privately. And no doubt that has happened. The public hears about it later -- if it works.

"None of the cryptocurrencies are truly decentralized. They’re actually centrally controlled by the miners, who can basically rewrite history at will."
*That* is bullshit. What -- bitcoin miners can rewrite the blockchain? No, they cannot. Weaver is either ignorant of his subject or consciously lying about it. 
"These systems require an obscene amount of energy to function." *Obscene* is just his pejorative.  Electric signs and the World Series and the Super Bowl require lots of energy too. Miners, it should be noted, are willing to pay for their energy. They do so because the bitcoins they mine have a free-market value that is high enough to earn them a profit after expenses. 
"But why do you need such a system? Because you’re doing a transaction that a central authority would otherwise block, like paying off a hitman or buying drugs."
More bullshit. The Nutty Professor seems wholly ignorant of how the bitcoin blockchain allows everyone to be their own notary public. I would challenge one of Weaver's students to ask him how that works. He will either not know and so be unworthy of his contract with the school as a "researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley [who] teaches a course on blockchains"; or, if he does know, it would instantly put the lie to his claim that public blockchains are only for those seeking illegal goods and services.

Typical semi-dumb *Wired* story. This idea amounts to asset forfeiture. In order to implement it, a given bitcoin address would have to be formally charged with a crime. It would only work if the indicted address resided in a registered third party, like Coinbase, and the holding party kept it there. But if it is your own self-created address, certainly no one could seize it. And it is inherently counterproductive. Consider the following comment from the story:
*And if innocent users end up having their coins claimed as stolen property, they'll quickly learn to stay away from Bitcoin laundries and shady exchanges . . . If you’re not the person who went in with the stolen bitcoin in the first place, you’re never going to play that game.*
Here's the flip-side:
*And if guilty users end up not having their coins claimed as stolen property, they'll quickly learn to use Bitcoin laundries and shady exchanges . . . If you’re  the person who went in with the stolen bitcoin in the first place, you’re going to keep playing that game.*
I doubt that bitcoin addresses will ever be used this way.

Well then, so be it. As long as a miner can make money from it, it will eventually be confirmed. If money cannot be made, it will not be confirmed. Bear in mind that you could hash all the data in a database, include that hash in your next database, hash that, *ad infinitum*, and thus create your own blockchain. Use the final summarizing hash to create a bitcoin brainwallet. Send to that address the minimum amount needed to complete the transaction. Think how cheap *that* would be! Which is why the Bitcoin blockchain will probably be used for data registration more than for currency transactions.

We will see. Actually I hope you are right if you are telling me that I'm wrong. I would like to see Bitcoin scale and Seg Wit quickly adopted. I just don't see that happening. I see Seg Wit going the way of Bitcoin Classic, alas.

As a member of the public, you don't. Most people would register data on the blockchain for internal record-keeping purposes only.  You would take your data, perhaps add a nonce, use it all to create a brain-wallet address. Send a fraction of bitcoin to that address. The transaction itself is instantly available for viewing, if only as an unconfirmed transaction. If you pay a minimal fee, it will take a while to be confirmed. But that won't matter for your purposes -- it *will* eventually be confirmed. Later, when needed, you would point your accountant or the IRS to that address as proof that the data you are showing them was a certain figure by a certain date. 
I should point out that I personally think that Bitcoin *should* scale up. I just don't think it will. I also don't think Bitcoin will catch on as a currency -- because it will never scale up. {Loop}

Capital Economics, the winner of the 2012 Wolfson Economics Prize for its proposal on how the Eurozone could be safely dismantled, now proclaims that Bitcoin -- a system of fast, economical, decentralized, sustainable, scalable, trustless, unhackable, and immutable data-registration -- is worthless.

Yeah, it's about time all right. But they are not incentivized to get it done because most of their customers don't know or care and won't stop using the wallet. Only when the number of new customers starts falling significantly will they bother to provide SegWit addresses. 
BTW, it's not really a web-based wallet. It's done within the browser, and you can use a Yubikey and other protections. If you aren't using a public computer and your own computer has solid anti-virus protection, it is a safe wallet. I used to use it until I migrated to Trezors.

On Fedcoins: " Instead of being updated by a network of unaffiliated peers, however, the Fedcoin ledger is managed by institutions certified by the Federal Reserve. “These authorized nodes could be things like Bank of America, JP Morgan—basically, trusted institutions . . . To  use fedcoins, people must first show proof of identity and set up a wallet with the Federal Reserve or an affiliate bank, at which point they can buy the new currency with US dollars at a one\-to\-one ratio. "
So it's just a digital dollar, expandable through administrative fiat like paper dollars.  No serious limit, unlike Bitcoin. And no immutable blockchain either. "Trusted institutions" can be counted on making whatever changes deemed politically expedient.

"The real concern is that if the price of bitcoin continues to fall, mining will become infeasible, and without enough participants providing the computing power to record the transactions, the transactions will be infeasible and bitcoin will become worthless."
No, professor Sarin. You've got your facts wrong. The system theoretically could work securely with one miner (although it would never come to that). What would happen if the bitcoin-price fell below a miner's cost is that he and others at his budget-level would drop out and the overall mining difficulty level would fall. If it fell far enough, hobbyist-miners who had been priced out would find themselves priced back in. Bitcoin mining would become increasingly decentralized. Fewer big miners = lower difficulty level = more smaller miners. The system itself would remain just as secure as it had been before.

Here we go again! "No intrinsic value," etc. "In what rational universe could someone simply issue electronic scrip — or just announce that they intend to — and create, out of the blue, billions of dollars of value?" The author actually thinks that what Bitcoin has done, while then pointing out that " Because it is so computer\-intensive,, it takes as much electricity to create a single bitcoin — a process called “mining” — as it does to power an average American household for two years." Out of the blue?  He then adds, "Cryptocurrency is best\-suited for one use: Criminal activity." Now why would criminals accept a currency that was created out of the blue? Are they that stupid? Or are they using a currency that is computer\-intensive? 
Yet another perceived thought\-leader has written the epitaph of his future reputation.

Tice said he is very positive on Bitcoin. He is not mining and didn't quite say he owns any -- kept getting interrupted. But Sullivan didn't really laugh at the idea, he was just surprised, and reiterated that Tice likes Bitcoin, and added "There's your headline -- Tice likes Bitcoin." But Tice also said he likes gold and gold mining better. I think he is wrong on that but it is good that a Wall Street guy is coming out in favor of Bitcoin.

Immutability is key. Private blockchains or shared Excel spreadsheets cannot be immutable. But suppose all those immutable data sources were to hash their data at regular intervals and place those hashes on the Bitcoin blockchain and then label them for public consumption, like those legal notices you still see in newspapers? Voila, immutable private blockchains and shared Excel spreadsheets! 
The banks, et al., have not yet thought of this. But, kicking and screaming, they quietly will. All blockchains and shared Excel spreadsheets will lead to Bitcoin's Rome.

I knew instantly and without effort that what he was doing was total and complete bullshit, the absolute equivalent of astrology, and thereafter never paid the slightest attention to the stuff except to laugh at it. I think that the crypto-community should demand that its media outlets never publish it. It's medieval and unworthy of attention.

The bad news is that the closer the deadline is, the slower the rate of signaling will be, and consensus will never be achieved. The good news is that there will be no forks over this, hard or soft. Instead, there will be technological solutions of limited scale that require no consensus -- miners, nodes, users will just come up with their own protocols and devices that other miners, nodes, and users will be free to use or not use. I would have thought that all this would be obvious by now.

Situations like this is where the Augur system will be a real help in the future. Instead of yapping about it, people could put their money where their mouths are. If Augur were fully implemented now, we would have a very good idea whether or not SegWit will be implemented by a given date.

1) You have to buy bitcoins to put your data on the blockchain. Then you sell them or keep them for future data-registration. The fee you pay will be nominal because you don't care how long confirmation takes -- the transaction itself is instantly available for viewing by anyone, all of whom will know that confirmation is inevitable. 
2) *Know* -- not hope -- that millions will be buying, sellling, or keeping bitcoins for exactly the same purpose and reason.
That's the plan.

I don't think Congress is stupid enough to try to "ban Bitcoin." It's a worldwide protocol.  People could stock up on hardware wallets the way people stocked up on guns when Obama was elected (for fear he would "ban guns", etc.); software wallets are available via Tor; and mining is nothing but a process of data-hashing about as threatening itself as the search for the next highest prime number. Could Congress try to limit mining by stipulating that "no one shall hash data at a rate in excess of *x y flops* per second"? Nonsense -- such a limitation surely would be inherently unconstitutional. Congress could try to impose stringent environmental controls on mining, but even then, there would be no local economic advantage in having miners in rural New York move to Canada and probably no environmental advantage either -- the key point being whether or not the electricity is subsidized to a rate below market level. Regardless, Canada would have to be onboard -- like it *wasn't* during Prohibition. Indeed "banning" Bitcoin would have parallels with "banning" alcohol.
It is hard to identify the constituency that Sherman, who represents the San Fernando Valley in California, is trying to impress. Congress isn't stupid enough to fall for it, and I doubt that many Californians are either. What he *has* done is put his name and pate out there in the media.

I certainly won't be surprised if it turns out to be a comprehensive carnival of every error ever said about Bitcoin, to wit: it is a pump and dump scam and ponzi (both); centralized in China; an environmental disaster; a promoter of porn, tax evasion, terrorism, and drug sales; its value diluted by thousands of alt-coins; repeatedly hacked (because *exchanges* are repeatedly hacked and no effort made to distinguish between the two); difficult and risky to purchase and sell; developed by gov't-hating anarchists (note the plural); susceptible to fraud (unlike Wall Street -- a comparison that won't be mentioned); and might be "banned" if not "regulated out of existence" by gov'ts. Oh but that the *underlying technology* has some potential.
As for the show's impact on markets, I remember when *The Good Wife* had an episode about Bitcoin. It had absolutely no impact whatsoever. Don't expect much if anything in the short term. But no matter what the show reports (or "reports") it probably is a harbinger of greater participation down the line. And as such it is a very good thing indeed.
