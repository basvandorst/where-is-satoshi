For a CEO it's odd you didn't see this rather obvious : it's not one of your staff. it's someone else, outsider, that figured it will create some disturbance. You probably went back had a talk with your exec team? it managed to rattle you or your staff just a tiny bit, create just a very tiny amount of distrust?  Yeah, he played it so it would get you perturbed. You have a relatively small team, so wouldn't happen there, highly unlikely.

Call your banks and credit card companies and ask them to cancel the transactions. Regulations at the banks provides indemnities for customers against fulfilling delays in online transactions.
