I believe you are.... The thread I responded too was "real world trade." You stated Gold is used in conductors as if that is it only use to drive up value beside PM and investment use. Since you stated that a "10% use gives something its value" (your idea not mine) I made the rebuttal that BTC will have demand of at least 10% to buy things like houses and cars... Is it that hard to follow?

Facebook, twitter, and netflix have large values and can't be used for something tangible. Mostly just digital paperweights... but offer a service for a need. Bitcoin/crypto in general offer a service as well with nothing physical.... ohhh I get it. You are one of those old guys that needs to hold something in their hands for it to be real. Got it. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:58:16
Just like gold. Completely worthless. I mean you can't spend it in store..... really?
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:07:14
Yeah what would I know??? Less than 10% of gold is actually mined to be used in industry, the rest if for investment and inflation resistance...... Nice try though. So if BTC is used 10% in industry(buying houses, cars, larger items) it can still survive. But, what do I know?? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:37:28
Do I need to? This is bitcoin after all. What you are referring to is a 51% attack that would take literally billions of dollars to undertake and then, maybe you get two-three blocks before the chains forks you out and starts mining the correct chain again. All for what? 20-30btc? Pretty bad return on investment. Are you one of those guys that can't go two seconds in a conversation without making something political? Who gives a shit about trump? Get over it. Before you morons voted him into office, no one ever talked about the guy, now he is everywhere because you are salty yo couldn't get your corrupt corporate shill elected. To be clear- they are both scum, but not everything pertains to politics. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:25:02
Good job, it is not, 3rd to be exact. Now answer the question where does the $40 fee come from after btc doubles? Which mind you a 60% return on invest is why there is so much demand for BTC. You can put your money in stock and bonds and get maybe 5% a year medium risk. Or 10% a year ultra high risk. Seems like the more you post, the more you set the stage of why demand is growing.

So will you admit you're wrong. See what you did was redirect the argument to your stupid political shit, and failed to realize I was actually right, and no explanation was actually needed. Aren't those called strawman? Not sure, don't keep up with narrow minded politics.

@_date: 2017-12-24 19:35:00
I was replying to the fucknazi guy, he said you can change and alter addresses, which of course is false, and the only way to do that would be to do a 51% attack and change the outputs. Once again, not saying that is the what is for, but to acomplish what OP was asking you would have to do such. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:19:44
the roads, education, and loan assistance that a majority of what people benefit form makes up less than 10% of where your taxes go. War, old pill popping hypochondriacs, and Welfare(of all sorts corporate and low income) makes up the rest. Very sad.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:09:56
"Payed" in dividends...... and you can't spell "Paid" Talk about showing true colors. You sound very old "cyrypto nonsense,"  What are you 60? Now they add the obligatory, "you sound like the horse and buggy guy talking about automobile nonsense"
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:16
Where is there an $85 fee? ohhhhh wait, I get it now. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Ok, cool. Also, I know a lot of people buying small amount of BTC to then exchange for atl coins..... so your argument literally holds no water. People buying alt coins adds to the demand for btc, lady.  Many exchanges have 0 fee to buy.... soooo. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:35:48
He is a buttcoiner, wouldn't trust that assclown for shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:01:29
What will you do when it fails/gets treated like the altcoin it really is? Will you sell at a loss?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:33:37
Well, you DON'T say. It is pretty apparent the FUD that comes out anytime we see a 5% drop. I can't wait for the next 40% spike that leaves people like you in the dust. If you think BTC is unsturdy because of some tether, you are sadly mistaken sir. That is an exchange problem (which affects people like you) not a principles, systematic, code, deflationary issue. So thanks for playing.

@_date: 2017-12-31 21:29:32
All this tax stuff is FUD, Tax advisors looking for work, shorters propaganda, or govenment shills. I wouldn't look into it to much. Tax law also states that "hobbies" aren't figured in your taxes. IE if you own a horse and try to write off your operation as "Farm" they will deny it because it is considered a "hobby" and not a farm.

Hello there, Fun police here. Yeaaah, So we are going to need you to pay your long term capital gains tax on that. Please remit payment to my inbox.

WAY smarter. Why does it have to reach 100k this(next) year? Maybe exponential growth is over, why can't it grow 10k a year for ten years? For someone that claims stocks are a safer investment, you sure don't provide many good talking points. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:03:56
Unlike Stocks, you can buy fractions. It you buy $100 in BTC and BTC goes up 10%, you now have 110$, why is that so hard for you to follow?
Edit: People said the same thing as bounced off 10k and then soared past it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:25:01
Yet, they will audit us normal folks that make 50k a year. Un-fucking-believeable.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:55:24
The 10k deposit you made to your bank. Ohh you don't know that the bank secretly reports to the IRS? Welp.... they do. You can thank your "patriot act" for that. (assuming you are American). Not Recommending anyone evading taxes. That's a bad Idea, but I can tell you all the rich people I know, keep "investments" "invested" so the tax obligation is limited to only when you need it. So, I am telling you to keep it in crypto until you "need it."

This last dump was an attempt to "PROVE TETHER IS MUHH SCAMM!" And it did bode quite well considering the 30-50% drop (depending on what shitty news site you read) Tether did well and kept its chin up. Now if everyone at once WD their tether, that may be a different story. But for now it works. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:33:00
Only to find out the guy was more of a kelp than a whale who sold at 13,500 because he missed the first dump and knows "this is the one"
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:06:55
Fair point, was just giving a scenario. That is why they have things like "asset forfeiture" In the US. Any amount of money over a "reasonable  amount" ,whatever the f that means, they will take it. Any they have a legal right to take it. It is an obvious money grab and push for people to use banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:07:46
Hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahah This guy. Don't drink the Koolaid bro. I hope this was an attempt at sarcasm. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:30:43
What I love is how this guy blames BITCOIN for it's greedy corrupt government. Now that is rich. You live in a country(presumably) where just this year women are allowed to drive. And if they just happen to use their blinker wrong it is possibly  death or jail time. I would reccomend that before you grill Bitcoin, consider your living conditions and ask yourself if that is really a place you want to live.

Step one, go to you parents room/office when they are not home. 
Step two, Get in the "financial file," depending if you are poor or not, may just be a stack of papers marked "Past due" or "final notice" (given their stance on bitcoin, there is a good chance it is the latter, but i digress)
Step Three, Final the SSN
Step 4 start an account on an exchange
Step 5 Get the credit card
Step 6 Profit

There is no way they can track a single person to the blockchain. They did that to scare people. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:01:20
Yeah, BUT the people that make these outrageous claims have a stake in the banks and corps. So of course they will smear the other guy.
