and?  It's unregulated.  Of course it's going to be manipulated.  Which is a great source of confidence in it yeah?

 "the chances of a new technology which allows humanity unprecedented financial freedom" the price dropping suggests that maybe it wasn't really that.  Like maybe you are holding onto it wishing it was that when it clearly isn't.  What if it's you who is preventing something like that from becoming a reality by clinging to something that clearly isn't working?  You don't get to claim moral high ground from wanting something you own to increase in value and give you free money

What's your point here?  That article is busting the myth that tulip mania was widespread, or that it caused a giant financial crisis.  It does not dispute that there was a tulip bubble, where prices rose and rose until suddenly they didn't.  Its position as the prototypical bubble isn't changed by the article.  They weren't worth what people thought, and the bottom dropped out, a pattern that has played out many times since

right and then when someone loses something it's "SFYL.  You should have followed these security best practices"

all those provide things that people value.  Are they worth it for what they consume?  That's a fair question to ask.  Of anything.  Even when it's a (or your) sacred cow

it doesn't occur to you that it's HODLers talking about how it's recovered from crashes before who "threw 3 sixes and think that will sustain"?  
"That's why they are here: somehow trying to move the price to recover their foolish losses and help themselves." This again sounds like HODLers.  Like every single The\_Physicist post, among others.  Encouraging people not to sell to keep the price from dropping even more so they can "recover their foolish losses".
Anyway yeah in a sustained bear market I'm sure the shorters are doing worse than the HODLers somehow.  haha

"for every seller there's a buyer hurrrrr".  It can continue to drop if fewer people are buying than there are people who want to sell that's how this works

yeah might as well buy stuff with an inflationary currency. Of course most people here want bitcoin to be deflationary.  Would make a lot of sense to buy things with it then eh

sure it does, if you know what log scale is.  Or can read the numbers on the y-axis.
It's a similar drop to previous drops and that chart shows it.  And for investing it's the percentage change that matters, and this chart an 80% drop today has the same vertical distance as an 80% drop four years ago.
That is to say an 80% drop affects you the same and it's irrelevant if you bought 1 BTC at $10,000 or 10 BTC at $1,000; your fiat loss is the same.

my initial understanding was that mining was just an arbitrary "waste this much energy to get some reward" thing.  Later I understood that mining was actually running the calculations needed to verify transactions and such.  If that is true, great, lowering difficulty will keep mining profitable for the people still doing it, but isn't there some baseline level of computation needed to verify everything?  Saying "it'll get fixed by lowering difficulty" makes me think it's right back to "waste this much energy for a reward".  If mining is indeed necessary for the cryptographic underpinnings of the whole thing, I don't see how a drop off in mining activity can just be absorbed

the pushback against log charts in this thread is hilarious and sort of sad.  I mean past performance is no guarantee of future performance or whatever and I seriously doubt BTC can continue (or get back to) exponential growth, but all these people acting like log scale isn't useful for an investment are really making my head hurt
