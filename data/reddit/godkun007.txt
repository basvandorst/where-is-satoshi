The funny thing is that we are now likely at the time when the bubble is forming. The US government recently showed interest in tracking and taxing Bitcoin (capital gains). This might cause Bitcoin to crash.

It is this sub. It is full of conspiracy theorists who don't need proof to believe in things.

If you think Bitcoin doesn't get its value from public faith, then you are delusional. Bitcoin only has value because humans say it has value. This is true for all currencies, because their entire purpose is to be an IOU. The only things that truly have value in this world is food, water, and heat.

You do understand that deflation is worse than inflation, right? It causes people to not want to invest their money and leads to an economic recession.

HODL is proof that Bitcoin (at least in its current form) can't be used as a currency. I mean why would you buy that pizza with Bitcoins that might one day make you a millionaire.

These are oversimplifications for the sake of making a point. No one says that inflation in the abstract is good. The point isn't that "deflation=bad, inflation good". The point is that inflation in small amounts is usually a sign that demand is growing, while deflation is usually a sign that demand is falling. There are however other possible reasons for this that have to do with supply.

Somehow, I dont feel like wiping your ass with money is very comfortable. 
Also it is literally impossible to have an "inflation proof" currency because the value of currency is literally based on market confidence. If Bitcoin was "inflation proof" it wouldn't be as volatile as it currently is. Learn economics people.

You are acting as if any type of inflation is hyperinflation. That is objectively wrong. Inflation has been stable at 2% for decades. And you can beat inflation extremely easily by putting your money in a GIC or any other form of investment. 
Bitcoin is a terrible currency because of how volatile it is. Bitcoin going from $1000 in value to $10,000 is not a good thing. All it means is that no one wants to spend it out of fear that they will miss out on it getting even more valuable. You may not like it, but printing money is often used as a way to keep the value of money stable.

Yes, with a currency that will be roughly the same value tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:08:00
Think of it like this: If you want to buy a car that costs $10,000 today, but would likely cost $5000 tomorrow, would you buy it today? This is why deflation is bad. It causes people to hold on to their money because they think they will get more out of it in the future. This then leads to companies making less money and being forced to shut down. Before you know it, the economy spirals into recession because people lose their jobs and end up with less buying power in the end.

This post and bitcoin have been going through hyperdeflation.
edit: You can't tell me that 1000% deflation over the course of 2017 is not hyperdeflation. That is literally the definition of the term.

Home prices are a mix between demand and speculation. If there is a sudden influx of people wanting to move to an area, home prices go up. When that happens, people buy homes with the purpose of reselling them for more money. This can drive home prices up even more. As for a decrease in price, this normally happens when people literally can't afford to pay for the houses anymore. Normally, this just leads to housing decreasing in value until they reach a reasonable price. This however can lead the market to collapse if there isn't proper regulation. 
2008 is a great example of this. The general philosophy was that housing prices will forever go up. This meant that mortgage companies were giving loans to people who couldn't pay them. This then led to mass foreclosures and the entire housing industry crashing. What made 2008 particularly bad was that mortgages were a multi-billion dollar industry which had a multi-trillion dollar insurance industry guaranteeing the debt that was filled to the brim with fraud. This turned what should have been the normal boom-bust cycle into the worst recession since the 1930s.

No, deflation decreases investment and leads to a recession.

There was a time when those chocolates were worth more than a Bitcoin.

Inflation rates over the last 10 years have been largely stable with it peaking at 5% and reaching a low of -2% during 2008. I would trust trained economists over a "trader" any day of the week. 
Bitcoin won't flat out. The fact that it has a relatively small maximum amount that can be mined means that there will reach a point where deflation is guaranteed. This is why some of the smaller coins have a way larger chance of making it to the mainstream than Bitcoin. 
In particular, litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are the 3 I think are most likely to reach the mainstream. This is because there will be enough supply to stop deflation and they have better technology than Bitcoin (I have made several hundred dollar purchases with litecoin and have spent pennies on the transaction fee).

It is also worth mentioning that most consumer choices are driven by confidence. If you are confident you that you will keep your job and that you will be able to pay your mortgage indefinitely, then you might upgrade to the fillet mignon. If not, you will start cutting your spending out of fear of uncertainty. This is why many recessions are often self fulfilling prophesies. 
I have included a very simplistic drawing I made in paint to show what this cycle looks like. It is basically once one person slows down their buying, everyone else follows suit and it leads to a recession.

General goods. Inflation doesn't pop out of nowhere. Inflation is just what we call it when the average prices of general goods (usually using the CPI) increases. This could happen for 2 reasons, either demand goes up and supply stays the same, or demand stays the same and supply decreases. 
For deflation to occur, there are 2 possibilities. Either demand drops while supply stays the same, or demand stays the same and supply increases. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:45:27
No it isn't. Inflation is when the same amount of money buys less goods and services. A decrease in value literally has the same effect. This is why the Venezuelan currency is worthless. It isn't because the government increased supply, it is because no one trust the currency.

People do wait on buying phones because a better one is coming out in a year. I haven't paid full price (or anything near it) for the physical phone in years. My carrier will basically give me last years model for free once the new one is announced. I am currently using the Samsung Galaxy S8 and I paid $0 for it because my carrier offered me a free upgrade when the S9 was announced. 
There is also the fact that the people who do buy phones every year don't see it as a long term purchase. They already know that they will be buying a new one in a year, but the accept it because they want the short term benefit. Everyone else will either wait for a sale of some kind or buy 1 phone and then wait for it to basically stop working before upgrading. 
Either way, when we are talking about economics, we are talking about the economy as a whole. The phone market is only a very small part of the economy. A better example to look at would be the housing market. That is by far the largest segment of the economy to the point that when that market crashes, so does the rest of the economy. Would you buy a $500,000 house knowing that you will be able to buy it for $450,000 in a month? That is what we mean by deflation leading to people holding onto their money.

People will hate me for saying this, but taking out a mortgage to gamble on a currency value increasing is beyond stupid. I mean what would have happened to this guy if Bitcoins prices stagnated? Or if the EU decided to ban the currency and the price plummeted? This literally had to potential to ruin his life and no one should see him as a hero.

Right before the Great Depression people saw an opportunity. There is no such thing as a sure thing, as someone who has played a lot of poker in the past, I can guarantee you that. You should never bet your entire life on 1 hand or 1 commodity. There is a reason why diversifying your portfolio is one of the basic rules of investing. You never know what will go wrong. 
I mean just think what would have happened if Bitcoins did suddenly get banned in half the world. I mean this isn't even that far fetched of a statement. Bitcoins can't be tracked and therefore are used for some shady shit. It is only a matter of time until governments catch up and regulate the shit out of bitcoins. Whether that is tomorrow or in 2 decades I don't know, but it is for sure coming.
