You can open an account with bitfinex.com (bitcoin exchange) using a throwaway email address.  Deposit your BTC, then withdraw the next day to a new address.  No way to track them to you, and it's perfectly safe.

When version 0.8 was released, Gavin said there would likely be a definitive plan for the Maxblocksize getting increased beyond 1MB.  Do we have that now?  
If not, shouldn't this release include at least a partial fix???  Even if it is a hard coded kludge like "after block 350,000, Maxsize = 20Mb".  That would prevent .9 clients from completely breaking 2 years from now when the limit is raised in version 1.0.

Precisely.  Everyone will cash out a significant piece of their BTC, as it becomes the majority of their wealth.  I am mostly retired and live off my investments, and I invested 10% of my liquid assets in BTC, but it has become 75%.  Every time it hits a new high, I will sell or spend a little BTC rather than dig into my increasingly small "other" assets.

From now on it is going to spike every year at Xmas time, just like Amazon's sales. The effect will be huge this year, possibly testing the network capacity (I.e. Blocksize limit will get hit).  Fortunately the community will have about 10 months after that to figure out the scalability issue.

The problem with gas stations is that you have to prepay if you are using cash.  In this situation, Bitcoin is inferior to credit cards, as you will somehow need to type in the amount *before* you begin pumping. 
Has anyone thought of an elegant solution that would make buying gas with bitcoin as easy as swiping a credit card?  Perhaps you scan a qr code to transfer $100 to the pump, then get the change back to your wallet after the amount is determined?  Maybe Circle can figure it out...

He's off by a factor of 20.  $150,000 per BTC would be about right, for a $2 trillion market cap.  Then $300 billion of THAT would represent the 1% of offshore assets that actually moved to Bitcoin.  The rest would belong to early adopters, miners, lost accounts, circulating money, etc...

Actually you can earn substantial interest on your BTC by loaning it to shorters on Bitfinex.  I'm making a 40% annual return right now (.1% per day).  As an added bonus it will feel great to squeeze them someday.
The rate won't stay this good forever, but it's better than zero.

Wrong, mainstream will never care about cryptographic bits.  Storage is in GigaBytes and Terabytes, and bandwidth is in megabits and gigabits.

First you send them BTC and move it to your "deposit" wallet.  In their "liquidity" section, you state that are willing to loan 1 BTC at 0.xxx% interest (per day) and choose a timeframe from 2-60 days. They can always pay it back early, but otherwise you do not get it back until the expiration you selected.
There is a risk of the loan losing some principle if the BTC price goes up extremely fast and the borrower doesn't have enough margin to cover the loan. They are automatically liquidated when their collateral falls under 13%, so the risk is very small. 
So every hour the loan is outstanding you get a prorated amount credited to your account. You compete against other creditors, so the interest rate you need to offer fluctuates.
You can also borrow USD to buy BTC but the interest rates can approach 100%/year.  Better to be the loaner...

As a policy, it would be stimulative to the economy to tax all trading of btc as if it were a foreign currency.  However, if it is spent directly on merchandise or services -- or donated -- all gains are tax free.

Coinbase is an exchange too.  They do their best to match buyers and sellers internally.  When demand exceeds supply, they source from other exchanges, but there is probably a daily limit.   Due to buying pressure from their users, they've likely exhausted their buffer of inventory and are forced to raise the bid/ask above the other non-gox exchanges.

It's a 1000-for-1 stock split!  There will be 21 Billion embees in circulation.
It looks more like a real currency now, worth more than a Dollar, less than a Pound.
Perhaps we should come together as a community and simply eliminate the current BTC as of January 1, 2014.  After that mBTC becomes the *new BTC*, and version .9 of the reference client could enforce the "split" with a simple GUI change.  Nothing in the protocol changes.
Coinbase, Bitpay, etc... could easily agree to modify their GUIs at the same time.

If the average block time remains around 7 mins, the next Halving will occur a year early, as soon as January 2016.  Unfortunately, to do that, the difficulty will need to increase 100x per year (10% per week compounded). 
 Not likely to happen unless BTC skyrockets to $50,000+ and drives major network investment...but 6 months early is doable, so we are looking at maybe July or August of 2016 for the Halving.

Pretty obvious they are having trouble procuring coins.  
(1) it takes time to get
Money into mtgox and Bitstamp.  You have to send currency BEFORE you buy.  Coinbase is realtime, they pull the funds from your bank AFTER you buy.
(2) Thus they are raising the bid/ask to encourage more supply and discourage demand, so that they can match buyers and sellers.  
(3) When there is massive demand that they can't meet, coinbase has to buy BTC from Bitstamp.  The delay can be several days.
So coinbase's price is acting almost like a commodity future.  You are paying a premium to lock in the price, to receive coins several days from now.

This is an indication that Coinbase's BTC inventory buffer is drying up quickly.  It's a lot easier for them to collect BTCs from merchants than to send the orders to Bitstamp, Campbx, etc.. They are trying to balance supply and demand within their own ecosystem.

Just to make it a bit more fun (and secure), I used MS Paint to white out a few of the letters in the private key which together make up a code word that only her and I will know.

Really, you think we will see a 10x increase in difficulty every 6 months for 100 years?   That's like 2 to the 700th power...a much bigger number than cracking sha256.
The % increases can't mathematically continue at this rate for more than a year or so.  The supply will end about 2 years early in 2138.  2137 at the earliest.

500,000 ACTIVE users is amazing.  I am a "serious" user and I probably only have my client running 20% of the time (I only need it when sending BTC)

Maybe it's the $27 guy that found 5000 coins, parlaying his newfound wealth into mining equipment

BoA blocks online-initiated wire transfers to both Bitstamp and MyGox.  Talking to one of their reps, they said they might allow it in person at a local branch.  I didn't bother... I've been using coinbase ever since.

That doesn't seem necessary.  in fact it's a dangerous promise to make.  It would be perfectly reasonable to drop the rig price by, say, 25% per month as you scale up production and the difficulty increases by 40+% per month.  The first to receive the units should expect to pay the most.
You will have to drop the price at some point in the near future, to remain competitive in a fast changing game.  Be careful what you are saying.

More simply, just make it 10x the current block number.  The current block size would be 2.7Mb.  By the time of the next halving, 4.2Mb.  You could always increase the factor, if necessary, in an official release.  But this method would keep the size of the blockchain well under control.

I thought it was more difficult to buy Yuan than USD.  Seems like anyone who wants to invest in Yuan (also a depreciating currency vs. USD) could do so rather efficiently (and profitably) by buying BTX on bitstamp and moving it to btcchina.

Looking forward to switching to Yu-bees
