I think OP is hoping to sell in 2039 and buy in 2040 after everyone reading this sells. Smart.

Nice post, Op.
As an economist, I'd like to ask you; what you think separates/differentiates Bitcoin from other cryptocurrencies and why (if you think so) Bitcoin and not some other cryptocurrency; will eventually replace fiat money?
Thanks for your insight.

I wonder if it was Satoshi Nakamoto himself who sent the donation... Anyway, great news and all the best to Andreas!

Sorry for your loss, and thanks for sharing, altho you've probably still done better than most people by getting in so early.
I've unsubbed from r/btc today, just had enough of the FUD on there. Don't need any that negativity in my life.

Christ, this is so true right now!

This is what he just posted on his Twitter feed:
"Got thousands of people to believe I took out a mortgage to buy bitcoin, lost it all, and still nobody sent anything to my wallet. Fuck y'all"
Saving his tweets to show him how much he could have made if he didn't cry wolf ��

Great post, I've been following Bitcoin of Reddit for some time now and decided to sign up so I could post a comment to this post.
I'm experienced in day trading stocks and foreign exchange, albeit not a great trader, and recently diversified in Bitcoin. I've had the urge to trade Bitcoin but have managed to hold off because I know I'm not a good day trader, (and this post has reinforced my determination to Hodl) and up till now, the Hodl method has been a rewarding trading method for me, and I'm more relaxed and calmer for it.
So thank you OP for your post and your humility. Many of us think it but can't act on it. Many of us fail and keep it to ourselves, but you weren't ashamed to share what you've learnt. And at least you didn't loose any money on your trades.
I hope to hear from you again in a few years and to hopefully find out that you've made some good gains Hodling over the years. All the best to you buddy.
