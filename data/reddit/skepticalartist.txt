In reality, if I didn't have any I wouldn't be that impressed.
I got in fairly early and it's turned out okay so far. It's complicated, too easy to steal and requires unnecessary energy consumption to mine. The blockchain is slow and unwieldy and transactions are at a very low volume. 
Currency is based on reputation and trust. With the recent spate of high profile frauds/thefts a high percentage seems to be in the hands of thieves and criminals.
As it stands go BTC ! If a small batch of bitcoin acquired with very little investment could one day be a life changing amount then great.

Nice photoshop. Shared with credit to OP on Twitter !  I hope that's cool.

7% of total currency falls into the hands of hackers. How many hacks have there been over the years ? Any currency is built on reputation and this is hugely damaging to reputation.
Plenty of Schadenfreude but  is unfortunately a currency of greed.

Yep, Google's pretty open about how it targets ads.  There's even automated ad matching on gmail based on your messages. You get emails about drugs then yep even though apparently no one's reading them you will get ads tailored towards this.
It's a bit spooky when you get targeted from specific things. Currently with a 6 month baby they blast me with baby stuff.

My understanding is that coins are being mined at a huge loss right now in the hope that prices will continue to rise  I'm dubious of this graph but if it is costing more like $3000 to mine a coin then currently BTC is undervalued.

Namecheap have been accepting Bitcoin for a while. I can thoroughly recommend them.
