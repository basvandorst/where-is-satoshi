Don’t you know that wall streeters live paycheck to paycheck and have to wait for their meager bonus to manage to afford anything ? It’s rough man

Yes it’s called “raising the prices according to inflation”

I’m up voting you just so that your retardness goes to the top

It’s not “in demand when price fall” it’s being printed when price fall in order to pump bitcoin to make sure people don’t cash (hint: because they can’t ) and continue to hold

Considering that speech was just during the dot com bubble I think with 20/20 hindsight we can say that Buffet was right

I don't know.. do feel stupid when the Executive of one of the world most influential and one of the richest self made man in the world slam bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:26:55


It doesn't work like that. At all
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:04:05
Those are not features of bitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:21:39
Which exactly means Bitcoin has no value
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:00:02


Oh god no it's not.

So many bad things in this thread but bad math irks me the most

It's a GNU project but it's not "made by GNU" it doesn't mean anything.

\&gt; When you were going to medschool, I studied the merkle tree. When you were having premarital sex, I mastered the blockchain. While you wasted your days at the clinic in pursuit of healthcare, I cultivated inner strength. And now that the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me for help.

So why do you hodl if not that you think crypto is going up ?

Which is exactly why the USD is so valuable.
It's amusing watching crypto holders slowly discover how the economy works
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:45:02
Because they are cash advances, or is bitcoin suddenly not a crypto**currency** anymore ?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:35:48
This analysis is complete shit and proves nothing either way

He arbitrarily decides to remove outliers. While this may be justified in his field (biology) because you expect measurement errors this cannot be justified here as we know the data is perfectly correct. His own analysis shows that there is statistically significant correlation between the two until he decides to arbitrarily censor the data.

No you should have sold around 30-25K as it was dropping and bought back at 6-10K when it was going back up. You would have been rich as fuck AND would have more bitcoins by being a "weak hand". Instead you're just an idiot.
