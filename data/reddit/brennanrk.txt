I love Bitcoin

Good point, and I also would never wear a gag shirt. However, I wear a few shirts with brand logos if I love what they make or what they stand for. The idea is that I could not find any Bitcoin shirts that weren't obnoxious gag shirts, so I wanted to see if I made a few of these if anyone else who faced the same issue as me would be interested as well!

My dad owns a coin store in LA and also loves Bitcoin! So happy he showed his love for Bitcoin for this bit, [

He's the greatest dad I could ever ask for!

This is true, but I could only find obnoxious gag Bitcoin shirts. I couldn't find one simple one like this to show my love for Bitcoin without looking like neckbeard

LOL!! They mostly deal in gold in silver which is not fiat

I disagree, because with that mentality then why have anything nice if it's going to make you a target (phone, watch, car, etc.). And for example, I have a shirt with one of my favorite craft chocolate companies on it and everyone who recognizes it gives me a compliment and then we instantly have a conversation in which we have something in common about.

I work with a silk screen company and it's not as easy as you think to print a high quality shirt. Here is a video of the amount of work that is required and how much machinery it requires...  . Maybe if you go to the mall and print out an iron on design that comes off in the dryer after a couple of washes on a low quality shirt you may be able to save a couple of dollars.

Im opening up a salon that gives a free Bitcoin shirt with every $500 haircut

True, but couldn't one say the same about someone wearing a Diamond tshirt?

I always buy here and there and sell whenever I need to pay off a debt. But the best piece of advice is to not to listen to other people's advice.

Of course a pawn shop would buy them, they buy jewelry and diamonds from people all day long and don't call the police on them. It would go down like this, "I inherited these diamonds from my grandma who just passed away and I wish to sell them to cover some funeral costs" ... "Sorry for your loss, here's some cash."

Haha yes!! Truly one of a kind kind of man

I've looked into Hawala a little bit and I don't know how it's much different than localbitcoins, other than personal information would be more publicized.

Depending on where you live, it may require special state and federal licensing. You don't want to be an unlicensed money service business, you could get in a lot of trouble .

He publicizes what he needs to say in order to manipulate the market in his favor. Either that or to just sound smart in a volatile market. He supports Bitcoin as it skyrockets so he sounds smart, and he bashes it as the price plummets so he sounds smart. I remember reading on his wikipedia page that he made a fortune during the dot com bubble by selling his investments right before the stocks dropped.

It provides a means to allow people to have more freedom over your funds. No one can freeze your Bitcoin wallet or loan your funds without your permission. No entity can manipulate the supply of Bitcoin, therefore will not be subjected to inflation (look into how the federal reserve works). Unless the price of 1 Bitcoin exceeds $1 million USD, then the smallest unit of Bitcoin will be under a penny, which could have use cases for facilitating microtransactions. Here are just a few reasons that piqued my interest and investments.
