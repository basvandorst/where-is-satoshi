Cool story bro. Does he realize Bitcoin is global? I don't live in the USSA, I don't care what laws you pass there, Bitcoin is everywhere it doesn't need government and regulation to 'take hold' and it has even larger benefits to the other 6 billion people in the world who need bitcoin due to an inefficient and corrupted financial network.

You say it's open source but where is the hardware BOM? Only Software on github?

Umm......Okcoin has like 40 employees, then you have Huobi, Btcchina, HitBTC, LakeBTC....more like USA likes to shout about things the most. Actually Bitcoin jobs are made in China....no to mention to miners being produced there.

Correction, Okcoin has 60 employees before their latest funding:

lol Bitcoin as a 'risk' to Australia's payment network- more like risk to their corrupt monopoly. How about we let individuals decide what they want to use to transact with rather than have a mandated system and compliance forced upon them? Competition is good. Thats how innovation works.
They can try all the want, but they're a central bank.....bitcoin doesn't need them.

This is what a standard PCB factory looks like, it's fine. You know board  assembly, hand soldering and testing doesn't take place in places like Intel's fabs, it's not necessary- I have lots of experience with factories like this in Taiwan.

Yeah I'm experiencing the same thing. Have received one email to one new user but not the other. Also not quite sure what I am doing.... added some email addresses to get sent the acceptance message, now have 'accepted'. Now what, UI is stil the same, cant see the address to send funds to?

Can we please stop the love-in on 'decentralised' exchanges, they don't solve the problem of fiat, so they are mainly useless. I'm not going to be paying multiple wire fees ($20) every time I need to send the next installment to the buyer/seller. 
Localbitcoins is as good as it gets until fiat currencies don't exist.

The perception from the community since their inception is that theyre a joke selling a $400 rasp pi having raised $120m to essentially launch an API which hardly anyone uses.

With a 1% withdrawal fee for SEPA + 4-50 EUR also need a European account in EUR. Swift fees inwards ~30 USD and a 1% + Swift outward too. 
Localbitcoins is more decentralised than this.

Obivously not decentralised if there is a 'list of countries'. Also has Paypal and OKpay lol.....Its like a worse version of an exchange. 
Strip out the fiat stuff, make it for altcoins and you are onto something.

This is why LTC rose, it was an alternative funding method to get money into exchanges without needing to transfer BTC and get caught out. The attacker has most likely leveraged up before doing the attack to force a situation like this and has reaped the rewards.

This is no different to having you own wallet and sending BTC to an exchange when you want to exchange for fiat. If you want to exchange for fiat you need AML/KYC and to trust a third party entity that charges a 2-3% fee to fund your account in fiat. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:01:38
Also means you trust a centralised entity and require AML/KYC. So both claims of 'Decentralised' and 'No AML/KYC' are wrong.

I'm going to submit the idea of a decentralised, cryptographically sound, limited supply digital currency that has no leakage of private information and completely removes the need for a central bank like the Bank of England to exist.
