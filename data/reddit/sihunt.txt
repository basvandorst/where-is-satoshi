That was what gold was doing for the first half of 20th century. Banning gold payments and starting the ETF allowed the gold price to be controlled and stopping massive inflation in fiat. 
A bitcoin ETF may be a way of controlling it like gold but the government will never be able to ban it or collect it up.
When I started looking at BTC and fiat currency supply and rates, back in 2013, it occoured to me that I was noy watching a rise in BTC but simply starting to describe the devaluation of fiat. So to get a better piture I turned my monitor upside down (usd/btc) so it just shows how fast the usd is falling. Btc does not bubble fiat whirlpools down and then struggles back to do it again as central banks print more.

HODLing since 2013. Traded cyrptos from 2017 to Feb 2018. Doubled my btc. Spent some on housing and bills - loved that. Should gave taken a LOT more USD out when I had over $100K - regret that. Focused back on my day job and had nice success in 2018. Traded small amounts of cryptos recently but loosing 0.5 btc now but not closing out as waiting for market turn around. Tempted to buy some more btc now with cash. 
Yes this is a big short on fiat currencies. I remember turning my monitor upside down in 2013, looking at the BTC/USD chart and thinking "wow the usd is really falling and loosing value". I am still positive, still believing, still want finacial freedom, still think BTC will bring good to the world and bring billions of people out of poverty giving them control over their wealth. Should I get a Lightening Node..... proberbly yes. Get more involved and support the network that supports your wealth.

You are doing good. I had and 80% loss for 2 years, expect that. I bought at $300 - $1000 massive pay off last year. Target is finacial freedom by 2023. Buying as it drops is very smart but takes balls and guts to watch the losses pile up. Keep going you inspire me to buy again now. Dont spend any money that will effect you current life style.
