The founder of the weather channel disagrees with you: 
Global Warming is a fraud.  Read the article.  The scientists get funded grants by government. Its sad that the scientific community has become so corrupt, and some good people got sucked into it and brainwashed as well.  They got pressured to go along with the crowd.  They thought because every professor tells them global warming is real then it must be true.  I used to be on your side and worked on green energy products.  I know how it all works, and over time I realized its all a fraud.  Hopefully you will realize it too someday.  Stop calling us deniers, its just an ad hominem attack, a personal attack.  There are many credible scientists who are brave enough and have the guts to stand up to the fraud.  Even if we were warming then that is a good thing.  The Earth needs some warming, lets stop destroying humanity and giving monopolies to energy companies like GE for fear of a fake problem.  GE lobbies to shut down their competition so nobody can open power plants because of carbon emissions.  Its called "regulatory capture", if you don't know what that means look it up.  Also they have captured the professors, universities, and academia through their fraud and government control, by using government grant money and alienating any scientists who disagree with global warming.  
I feel good that they called Satoshi a climate denier too.  I know Satoshi and I are on the same page with almost everything.  It feels good to have others awake to reality.
