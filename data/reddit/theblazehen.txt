Got a reply:
 Hello,
Regarding permissions:
the read SMS permission is actually not used. It was used in a previous version when we were paying a referral fee for invitations sent via SMS. Since we no longer do this, we will be removing the permission in a future release.
Regarding SD Card, this is required to help us uniquely identify devices.
We must track location due because we do not offer our services in all jurisdictions within the United States.
Finally, we chose to include location when displaying information regarding users in all cases. If a player does not want this, then they can shut off location services, but won't be able to enter pay tournaments.
I hope this helps...

How do you feel about Bitcoin competing with the x.0 crypto-currencies, specifically currencies that are designed to scale to Visa and beyond transaction loads from the outset, and those currencies that offer a more complete "package"?  
Do you think that Bitcoin can evolve fast enough over time to compete head to head with an x.0 currency if one should see strong market adoption (which we havent seen yet with other alt's and class currencies)?
Do you worry that increasing the block size could lead to unexpected block propagation issues and a "runaway orphan" situation if a large portion of the network do not have the connectivity or hardware specification to keep up?
In your opinion as the blockchain grows in size will this lead to more centralized "power nodes" with everyone else operating via 3rd party services controlled by these "power nodes"?  Even with pruning and other chain size solutions, increased transaction load comes increased short term requirements to process current and recent transactions, which may further lead to additional migration to 3rd party service providers, is this a concern?

I'm not the dev, and therefore am not sure why, however I use Cyanogen mod with cyanogenmod with Privacy Guard enabled. I know that it does use location on startup, and displays your rough location when in a tournament. 
I'll send a mail to the dev asking what the permissions are for

 The developer hopes for this to eventually replace or coexist with the USD, not just bit coin.
This system would on current hardware be able to process over 10% of visa's transaction value.
It is more scalable than bitcoin, as the default implementation uses something similar to SPV .
It also has faster block times, ranging from 10s for POS systems, to 30s for online transactions.
We will also spend more effort on getting regular people to use emunie.

Hey man. I am extremely sorry but my money making plan has sort of failed. What i planned to do was buy 3 vps's at michrotronix-tech.com, so that if I mine litecoin on it it gives me a bit more cash than I put in.
I based the hash rate that I was going to receive on the performance of the one vps that I was able to buy.Two of the vps's gave half of the hash rate of the first and only 1 worked as it should.
After about a week they canceled my account on the single server which was going at the correct speed.
I am now mining with many trial vps's. Can I please have 2 more weeks?
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:33:40
changes after each transaction
