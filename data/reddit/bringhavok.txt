I believe that sentiment is often due to the fact we have struggled to abstract the technicality away and therefore have not built customer experience and/or UX that positions Bitcoin P2P payments as user friendly and easy. 
You should look at how fast "WalletofSatoshi" is as a custodial LN mobile wallet. It has baked in simplicity which renders a good user experience. 
This is a video:  
I think in time as we focus on this, the use case and network effect with more merchants brings us closer to the vision. You are correct however in that many elements like locking up funds may seem counter intuitive however I see it like a bank holding your money. You then can use it on any merchant that accepts such... All in time.

It's dropping because most who own BTC know little about BCH, as the propaganda forces them to believe 'its the real Bitcoin' just like pinocchio was a 'real boy'. 
They sell off seeing this childish shit between Ver, Wright, Wu, and the rest of the bananas in pyjamas and off we go. 
Hold on, grab a beer - and ride it out with us. It will be worth it I promise.

Yes, as the way the smart contract escrows those funds it is necessary to ensure you can protect yourself from malicious actors. 
The UX may improve to having phone applications and other tools to monitor it and make it easier to detect changes. 
Also the channel being there allows for greater network effect related to routing options. So though it's true your 1BTC may never move it means others can more freely to ensure no censorship by nodes.

This is exactly what TravelByBit does in Australia. Gives the merchant the option to keep the crypto or convert instantly to fiat. 
No payment processing fees from the intermediary portion. A simply web based application.

Without seeing it I can't be sure. But it sounds to be the case. This is known as your public key 
Always send a small amount first to be sure.

That doesn't look like Craig Wright... Oh wait, it shouldn't because he's a F...
