There is a reason they warn about catching a falling knife.  I'd rather give up a few points after seeing that the value recovered and settled down for a few minutes, rather than grab it before the selloff is finished.  I am not proposing selling at the top to buy at the bottom, just that it is usually a bad idea to buy when it is rocketing in either direction.

Honestly I think it is trading about at par right now, considering the rate it has been increasing since April.  Anything below this level I see as a good buying opportunity in the short term.  It is a good buying opportunity in the medium-long term either way.

I am not sure there is any such thing as a solid support in bitcoin land.

Watching the price movements has been crazy today.  It has been sold down by hundreds of dollars repeatedly and then it reliably recovers within a matter of a few hours.  It's nuts!  It is still working on recovering the early morning selloff (6am New York Time)  but every other selloff was covered within a short time.

Even if they do somehow earmark some bitcoin for you on robinhood and you feel the lack of bitcoin possession is unimportant, the bigger issue from my perspective has been that you are separated from the market price by some .2%-.5%.  When you go to make a market order, they show you a price that is higher for buys and lower for sales as far as what you can get.  Then, if you try a limit order, they will not execute it unless the price is beyond that threshold.  You can place a limit sell at 11350, watch the price go to 11360 or even 11370, and your order will not execute!  I find the lack of control very problematic.

Might wanna hold off till it settles down.  But yes, I think once it hits support it is a prime buying opportunity.

Go home bitcoin, you're drunk.

Just hope others see it the same way you do :)

It sucks because it feels like paranoia, but do you really want it to be possible for that to happen to your coins?  It has happened in the past to some of the biggest exchanges.  And it doesn't have to be an outside force attempting to do it.  What if an employee decides to make off with a bunch of coins?  There is just no way to fully trust anyone else with your bitcoins.  The less time they spend on an exchange, the better.

Depends on where you are from.  I am in the US and use coinbase pro, so fees are pretty low, around .15%-.25% depending on the order type.  ACH deposits and withdrawals, and btc deposits and withdrawals are free.

Just a PSA that bitcoin is still about flat compared to 24 hrs ago.

Sorry guys, the dip deepened because I bought some.
