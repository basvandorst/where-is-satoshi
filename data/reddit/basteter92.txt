The post was sampled from the song 1983 a merman I should turn to be. I hope someone catches it. Every time there’s a huuge dip that lyric springs into my mind

Who cares it’s a culture stuck in the 7th century.  Once their oil EROIs become uneconomical they’ll implode.

Ask a cab driver what they think of uber... Goldman Sachs and other banks opinions on bitcoin is worthless since bitcoin seeks to challenge their monopoly on global finance.

Not a bold prediction at all considering the last quarter of 2017.

Still made a lot of $ from this time last year and now the average joe has at least heard of bitcoin

If someone offered to buy my car in gold I’d turn them away because they have no way of proving that the gold isn’t alloyed with a cheaper metal without hassle and expense.  Today gold is an investment nothing more whereas bitcoin is a truly global way of safeguarding and exchanging wealth.  Gold bugs are living in the pre digital age and need to accept there’s a better alternative that has all the advantages of gold and much more.

And down and down and down and down we go...

It would have to average like a thousand dollar increase per day for that to happen.  I’m bullish but not to that degree

Interesting perspective however that still leaves open the capital gains tax issue.  After my parents pass I can see myself moving to a country where I can freely use my coins without worrying about the tax man

Max Keiser so none of the above
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:02:26
As long as people have to pay capital gains on every bitcoin transaction it won’t go anywhere in the us.  There’s no reason for me to use bitcoin over my visa which gives me cash back.  I hodl due to my acknowledgement of bitcoin as digital gold.

I know many ppl outside the space who think bitcoin is a joke due to the constant splits.  They ask me which bitcoin is the true bitcoin which imho is a valid criticism.

Umm I shopped 90 minutes away from my place in another state with a credit card and had a $300 transaction declined due to fraud fears.

Actual adoption I love seeing these posts as opposed to a pic of a coin star atm in a ghetto gas station.  Sorry folks but installing an atm is not adoption...

Patience you must have my young padawan

You can’t draw a clear conclusion on an asset that’s not even a decade old.  Plus people just started hearing about it enmasse for less than three years. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 02:50:47
Wait till they start complaining to their bought reps in gov the hysteria against bitcoin will be on par with reefer madness
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:42:03
To the avg Joe dropping over 6.5k on a super volatile asset that may plunge to 5k within a day is not at all affordable 
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:22:38
I don't think you get Bitcoin... The goal of bitcoin enthusiasts is the idea of hyperbitcoinization.  Now what that means is that bitcoin will be widespread in all countries and I'll be able to use it to purchase goods and services anywhere I like.  Why would I want to convert sound currency bitcoin to shit currency $ when I know bitcoin is far superior by being deflationary instead of inflationary? True bitcoiners view bitcoin as a revolutionary form of currency rooted in math and cryptography not a super hot investment fad to convert into fundamentally worthless fiat dollars.

Really ppl are so greedy.  From 2k to 6k in a year and you’re mad?  Since when has 200% been a pathetic return? 
@_date: 2019-02-23 00:20:45
Actual adoption... an atm being set up at a ghetto gas station isn’t adoption.  I’m sick and tired of seeing coinstar posts and people saying look it’s being adopted...

The only one I trust is Max Keiser

People have been peddling meaningless predictions all year and all have been wrong 
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:10:46
2018 has the potential to be the biggest year yet  since the herd has finally become widely aware of bitcoin and institutional investors might throw themselves into the ring.  Once established $ is thrown into the market the cap will sore the price will rocket and the average joes will fomo in.

Bitcoin is the hardest currency ever created by man it’s not just an alternative payment system
