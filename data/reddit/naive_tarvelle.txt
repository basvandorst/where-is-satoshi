Thank you. Is that a fact? I mean, i don't intend to doubt you, but i guess my question is - is this something you've personally witness or do you think it's what's happening? While I don't think i will lose any money 'entertaining' the deal, i am submitting my valid id to the AML process... so I'm a little concerned of course!

makes sense, thank you.

Right, and i think that's exactly the issue here, because on one hand, I think many of us would like the above to 100&amp; true and proven, including myself, which is why i was hesitant. But if I replace the word 'bitcoin' with 'diamonds', or whatever, does that still sound legit? I mean 'oh hai i'm your friend bob and guess what, i was contacted by buyer unknown to acquire 3billion of gold, do you mind looking into this'. 
In other words, maybe it's somewhat plausable to those of us who have been in the business for 4 years or more, for the very reason that we have all seen a lot of people get rich overnight, and therefore well, i mean why not? I am actually very tempted to accept, go through with it just to see what happens, as long as no one asks me for money, but still... could be ID fraud \(against the aml/kyc docs\)?

right, that's my big worry. Big worry indeed.

lol UK and in a way, I wish you were right, because this is stressful - if you look at this thread and upvotes, you'll see that there is no 'consensus' on the topic. Some think that these deals 'do happen', while others go straight 'scam'.
I was hoping for a clear cut 'yup tis a scam, and it works this way: blah blah' type answer, the same way we all understand nigerian prince scams.....
