This is probably the way I'll go with.  I didn't realize that localbitcoins worked outside the US, but I found a guy in Krakow who buys coins for cash.  After doing the math he pays about $542 a coin so it wouldn't be worth it.

She's done this before but it always seems weird when you don't see the rate at the ATM.

I do but it's not easy to wire from the USA to Poland. If it was I think western unions rates would be lower.

Traveling with a small child is already enough stress she doesn't want to worry about a large chunk of cash also.

Wow you just got chewed up and spit out. I'm actually doing the same as you except 30% bitcoin 70% market. To think that people will kick you in the face when you care about your child's educational future in 17 years is disgusting. Whether it's a sound investment or not the people on the front lines of the movement are grossly negative. Here is a Dad high 5 from me and let me lead you to a more positive group. +1000 doge

She does have friends and family there so it wouldn't be a problem. So I guess I have to find something like localbitcoins in Poland.

Our checking account is shared. Last time I asked my bank about wiring to Poland they basically told me how difficult it is and it's not worth it.  They pretty much pointed me to western union.

This sounds great but couldn't this just allow the user to run software that simulates web browsing?
