I'm interested in basic information.  
I trust the bitcoin community.  I won't use MtGox, and I won't use Dwolla.  I just want to know why I shouldn't / what they did.
I'm literally looking for a 5-minute summary.

The motivation to strike it rich is a huge reason for bitcoin's popularity.  There's nothing wrong or malicious about it.  This is how the world works.  People want.  Get used to it.

I see, thanks.  Any recommendations for good depth charts?

Thanks for the information.  
Any recommendations on nice, simple, accurate depth charts?

Thanks, that's exactly what I was looking for.

Currently there's dozens of posts regarding the situation, and none of them succinctly explain what the hell happened.
You can't take 5 minutes and explain it?  You can fuck off, to then.

Is it larger or smaller than a breadbox?

I'm sorry, but that's truly the only way I can respond to that.

You should probably edit this comment as to not spread false information.  Multitasking will **not** defeat this method.

If you don't like it, don't use it.  Don't come here.  Don't post ridiculous shit.  
Nobody is going to try to convince you to believe in it with your attitude.  Just like anything else in life, you can't change people's beliefs.  It doesn't matter though, since there is such a huge number of bitcoin users.  If you do your research thoroughly, you may change your mind, but no-one else can do that for you.

No shit.  This is how the world works.  If someone has an insight or hunch as to how to invest their money and make a profit... then good on them.  They knew how to profit before we did.
Same as the stock market.  People invest money in order to make money.  
And what do we care if early adopters (who have held onto a ton of bitcoin) make money?  We don't.  They do, but we, as outside observers, aren't affected in the least.
I would like to know how you think any of this is hampering or hurting anyone.  The only people being hurt are the ones who are poor investors and lose money on the market, or have poor security and have their bitcoins stolen.  Just like hard cash.
All of your arguments are flawed if you cannot make one valid point regarding how bitcoin has hurt anyone, other than the two scenarios I mentioned.  
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:50:30
Excuse me?  You don't even know how bitcoin works.
You don't give it away to "the people that made bitcoin."
Bitcoin is open source.  That means regardless of who programmed the client, the algorithms, etc., anyone with programming knowledge can see the source code for themselves.  This means you could verify that "the man" or whoever you think is "running this scheme" isn't ripping you off.
You contribute work (your computer calculates equations) and you earn money.  The money you earn is electronic in nature, and it's allocated to you by the [open source] bitcoin algorithm.
You then spend said money how you please.  You can also invest it in the market and wager that the price will increase, thus making more money.
There's nothing different about bitcoin than cold hard cash, for all intents and purposes.  People accept bitcoin as payment, thus bitcoin has value.
You're so uneducated about this and so closed-minded that, like I said, no-one will change your view.  This will be my last comment to you, so you needn't bother with a reply.
Just to recap:
1.  It has value.  Business and private owners accept it as payment.  There's no way you can justify your claim that "it's worthless."
2.  It's open source.  Anyone (with the programming skill) can verify that there's nothing shady happening in the code.
3.  There's no company / organization / person getting rich by means of running / inventing or otherwise administering bitcoin.  It's a decentralized system.  There is literally no one to pay.

I believe any sort of limiting / controlling / preferential treatment (whatever the case may be) should be written into the software.
If, like we've seen in recent days, there are many transactions from the same source / same amount and they're undercutting everyone else, losing money, just to create chaos, there should be some measure in the client to help defend against this sort of "attack."

Isn't this even more of a reason to change their policies?  They really do influence the price of BTC, and if people who abuse MtGox's service help to lower the price, then MtGox loses, along with the rest of the community.

I just have to say, I just woke up from a 20 hour nap, and after reading this, I thought I was still dreaming.
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:39:32
Fair enough.  Do you think this measure would discourage these malevolent parties from continuing their acts? 
Why wouldn't MtGox pursue an idea such as this?  From what I understand, they just increased their server capacity, but this really doesn't address the issue.

I don't think that would help, as the "bad people" could easily make a new wallet address and a new IP address.  Both are extremely easy to do.

Just to note, bitcoin is abbreviated "btc" or by using it's symbol:  ฿
At first glance, I thought we were talking about British Columbia.
