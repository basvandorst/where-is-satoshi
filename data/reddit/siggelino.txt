Thanks for news even though its bad news. I hope you recovered well from your loss. Got to stay strong. Peace :)

Thanks for the input. That's pretty much what I thought and sometimes it's nice to get that confirmed. I wonder if the police would take me seriously if I told them someone took my "e-money" and what the would do if the found the IP in a country far away.

Hehe. You made me laugh even though I feel like a sad, unwealthy shit. :)
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:03:09
No I wasn't. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:53:08
Nope. I have never used bitcointalk. But yeah. Good idea to not keep the same passwords on these sites. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:11:08
Well I don't know what to do now. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:20:26
Yep that's right. I had them stored on Mt Gox and bought them there. 
I use two step verification for my gmail but not for Mt Gox. I feel retarded. It's not a very simple password but I have used it for other stuff but nothing bitcoin-related.

Yeah I know (but try not to be a dick). I started with just about 300 dollars and didn't think it was a big deal but it increased over time and I didn't think of the safety since in my mind it was a "measly" 300$.

If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you another question. Mt Gox recommended going to the police but the odds of them catching the perpetrator is astronomical right? That's what I thought but since Mt Gox recommended it, can it actually work?
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:24:19
I wanted to but I needed to verify myself and I don't really have a place of residence to verify. I guess I could have talked to the support but it's easy to be wise in hindsight.

Thanks for the helpful answer. The thing was that I got a mail that said there had been transactions in my Mt. Gox account so I logged in and found I had several open bids and almost nothing left on my account. I tried to change password and cancel the bids but it was already too late. I watched the last btc disappear. It sucked big time. But I guess it means that the wallet was cracked. 
And yes, the account it was transferred to is out of my control.
I get it that tainting my bitcoins would be a bit naive because I think people would use them anyway.
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:39:26
Yeah. I got google authenticator now. I just don't know if I'll be using bitcoins anymore since I feel kinda turned of.
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:00:23
Here is the transaction. I'm a new bitcoin user so I don't really know what to make of it.
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:02:25
I guess it was a hosted wallet by Mt Gox.
I'm not really used to bitcoins so I'm not really sure but I've never used any other client software niether on PC or phone.
@_date: 2013-10-07 10:44:16
Thank you! I'll report this to mt gox. How did you find out that address is a mt gox one?

It made me feel pretty turned of by bitcoins. I don't think I know enough about the technology or why it's superior to my currency to really enjoy the sheer bitcoin joy. I'm studying now and I don't really have anyting to put away in btc anyway. At least I have supporting parents. :)
