“At this time, only residents of the United States may apply for a Shift Card.
In order to spend bitcoin via Coinbase, cardholders must reside in one of the following U.S. states:
AL, AZ, CA, CO, DE, DC, FL, ID, IA, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, ME, MO, MS, NE, NV, NJ, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, PR, RI, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA, WI, WV” This is from: 
Shift is getting more states, and maybe countries (I can't remember), very fast.
The Shift debit card works like any Visa debit card. You open a coinbase.com account. Put some bitcoins in it. Goto  and click on connect Coinbase.

Whether you want to pay taxes or not, I would keep most bitcoins hidden; not on Coinbase. Just because you're paying your taxes, doesn't mean the government won't decide you didn't, and freeze your coins. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 21:37:14
Shift debit card is great. As soon as they get in MD, and they are getting more states fast, I'd get the card (I have one), cause keeping your money in bitcoin allows you to ENJOY the rise to multi million dollar bitcoins.

Or if they see you have a bunch of bitcoins they want. They steal innocent people's stuff all the time. One incentive, is that the police get to keep 'drug' wealth seizures, so they will take cars cash, etc. If they catch your mom with $10,000 cash, they can and do just 'assume' it's drug money and take it. I'm not totally disagreeing with you, I'm just saying that all bank accounts, etc. the government has access to, are vulnerable. And when bitcoins goes to 10 million per coin, and you only pay 5 million in taxes, they might 'assume' you are holding out, and raid your Coinbase account. Silk Road investigator, DEA agent Carl Mark Force, liked other people's bitcoins a lot. And most people aren't keeping the painstaking track of the tax situation, for American bitcoiners.

Everything at Coinbase is insured, and they're regulated by the fucking feds. At  it says:
Question: “How do I report a chargeback or fraudulent activity? What protections do I have?”
Answer: “The Shift Card comes with the same consumer protections as any standard debit card. If you need to dispute a charge, please contact us at support or call 800-897-0717.”

What should we do??
@_date: 2015-12-14 05:09:08
Is there really a blocksize problem?????? I'm no expert, but if we imagine the blockchain does about 4 transactions per second, to make 1 MB blocks. Mastercard does about 380 transactions per second. So for ease, lets talk about the bitcoin blockchain doing 2,000 transactions per second. That would make 250 MB blocks (2,000 transactions per second /  4 transactions per second). 250 MB is only a 20 second download, with a 100 Mbit Internet connection. And as far as hard drive size, they are atleast 10 TB, some. 250 MB block, times 6 blocks per hour, times 24 hours per day, times 365 days per years (250x6x24x365), equals 13.1 Terabytes. So it all sounds doable, but maybe I'm missing something. In Satoshi's white paper on bitcoin, he thought it would be manageable. And in some writing of his, he talked about it'd be the bigger players who'd have to handle the blockchain, but he still didn't talk about it not being manageable.

THANKS, you feel my great pain of being a slave. We're all under tyrannical governments. I live in the US—FUCK this government. Sure, I try not to give the government any more money than I have to. You can't keep from paying some taxes, like sales tax. Cashila sounds Mother Fucking awesome. I don't pay 'to put bullets into children'. What happens after my money is taken at gun point is not my fault. Let's not steal from the banks, it's the government that's the crook, banks have to go along with the government or they would be out of business.

I'm totally against KYC and anything government; FUCK THEM! I'm thinking this debit card is  a step, and eventually it'll be just bitcoin in all it's glory with anonymity to boot. I always try to spend bitcoin directly, before spending them from Coinbase.

BUY NOW NOW NOW
I really don't get all the cautionary advise. People give it all the time, including the guys “in the know”, like Gavin Andresen. Sure, maybe something could be wrong with bitcoin, or maybe something could happen to it, but that's the same for anything. The US dollar could be worth half as much next year. There are dire signs all around us. But bitcoin is a very valuable idea, that hasn't been broken yet. It has stood the test of time. Bitcoin is a much better investment than anything I can think of. Sure, try to diversify, but it seems nothing has the possibilities of bitcoin. Yes, I was saying BUY NOW when the price was 1180usd and when it was 20usd; and it was great advise. Each bitcoin could be 10million usd. Bitcoin could be 5000usd in a week. Putting money into bitcoin is something to do NOW. I am puzzled about why the price is so low. But bitcoin has put its roots down, and that's much better news, than a good price. And even if bitcoin fails, it is a great concept. It's a big Fuck You, to the Man.

But can it not be easily explained? The patch was put on Launchpad; is Github not the official place for BU source code. Now that patch does appear to be on Github, signed and with the source code. If someone was running a BU node, I don't imagine they would be getting updates from Launchpad (and yes, I do use Launchpad for some stuff I can't get else where), so they'd be okay. Maybe the patch on Launchpad was just for testing or something.

Thanks, I hope so, about the nice faster tech to speed up computers soon! Apart from the network connection out of the computer, I always wonder, what the slow parts are. I guess hard drives are 'slow', and probably the cpu? Do you know, when waiting for tons of thumbnails of pictures in a folder to load, am I waiting on the cpu or the graphics card?
@_date: 2015-08-02 23:29:51
@_date: 2015-08-01 09:34:24
They also said that NAND (SSD drives) are 1,300 times faster than the spinning drives (hdd). We still have to wait on computers, even with SSDs, and we aren't waiting 1,300 times less. The regular SATA III connection is 6Gbps. If I could load stuff from my hard drive, at that kind of speed, I'd be in heaven. 
I don't think hard drive speed is much of a bottle neck with cracking encryption, I think the memory can the holding the instructions for the CPU, and it'd take a while to process that, giving the hard drive plenty of time to load more to memory.

I have laid bitcoin all out to my parents in detail, over and over again, for a few years now. And how their bank accounts aren't safe. They don't believe me, or don't want to. I've told them how obviously wrong Christianity is, and government, and they don't believe me. It's not just them, other issues with other people, I get the same result.
But in defense of the Greek ruling thugs: I'm pretty sure they only took part of people's bank accounts that were uninsured. For example in the US, the ruling thugs insure bank accounts to $250,000. So the Greek thugs took part of what people had, above the $250,000 equivalent. People with less, were “ok”.

I'm not sure it wasn't the Greek thugs taking the money from the Cyprus banks. I certainly was confused about it being Greek banks. And they did only take part of the uninsured amounts. I'm not sure if you read the quotes I listed; not saying you didn't, and you might have a point. The article you linked just kind of speculates, and does back up my post about it just being the uninsured money that was taken.

SORRY, my information is atleast a bit off. It must have been Cyprus bank accounts that got raided. It was atleast partly due to the Greek financial crisis. That is what I remember from the news, at the time. And Greece and Cyprus have some kind of close relationship. Greece did renig on paying back bonds, which caused money to be taken from Cyprus accounts. Below are a few references, links included. Note how often Greece comes up when taking about Cyprus.
From a Forbes article “There's Something Very Strange About The Cyprus Bank Haircut. Very Strange Indeed” (link 
“Although it’s interesting to note that the Greek haircut on government bonds cost the Cypriot banks €4.5 billion or so.” and
“Let’s be honest about it, if you’re clever enough to make a billion or two, clever enough to get it out of Russia, you’re not then going to lend it to the Greek Government, are you?” and
“Rather, it’s a problem of where those two banks invested their deposits. And it looks as if this was largely in Greek Government and Cypriot Government bonds. Which is why they are bust.”
Cyprus deposits are insured to 100,000 Euros. (Link 
From an article, “Greek bond investors take big 'haircut' in bailout deal” (link  
“Private bondholders, by mutual agreement, will get back just 26 cents for every dollar they're owed.”
(link  says “mad decisions to invest everything in Greek Government bonds”
Wikipedia “2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis” (link  
“The 2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis is an economic crisis in the Republic of Cyprus that involves the exposure of Cypriot banks to overleveraged local property companies, the Greek government-debt crisis, the downgrading of the Cypriot government's bond credit rating to junk status by international credit rating agencies, the consequential inability to refund its state expenses from the international markets[1][2] and the reluctance of the government to restructure the troubled Cypriot financial sector.[3]” and
“With a small population and modest economy, Cyprus had a large offshore banking industry. Compared to a nominal GDP of €19.5bn ($24bn)[13] the banks had amassed €22 billion of Greek private-sector debt with bank deposits $120bn, including $60bn from Russia business corporations.” and
“The banks were then exposed to a haircut of upwards of 50% in 2011[17] during the Greek government-debt crisis”

Bitcoin doesn't have an inflation problem. With fiat money, the powers that be print themselves more money. That of course is bad. It devalues the current fiat money. And inflation is impossible to plan for, because you don't know how much your money is being devalued. If a fiat was like bitcoin, and increased to a set amount, at a predictable rate, and then stopped, we could plan for that, and no problems. And nobody is taking the freshest bitcoins to pay off their donors, who make death drones, etc.
@_date: 2015-09-23 10:45:50
Sounds like a good answer peoplma. I'm not an expert.
Jess4less, there was nothing wrong with your question or complaints.
A lot of people on tech forums are what I call Aspergeric asshole-holics. People will post a question and the  Aspergeric asshole-holics start asking for more info, and delivering insults and problems. It'd be one thing, if these aholes solved the problems too, but they usually don't. I was friends with one; tried to help him; he was a genius; but it was all about him and endless nonsense, no matter how I tried.
Bitcoin is difficult, at this point, so it's nice if someone can help you get started. I help people. Big thing to remember, is backups, passwords, don't get hacked, and copy and paste bitcoin addresses carefully. I've followed better money tech since the early 1990s. When bitcoin came along, it was better than anything I'd heard/thought of. But I didn't get into it for a long time, cause I couldn't find it was well vetted. I would listen to Gavin Andresen, the chief developer, try to get the word out, but he wouldn't give us amateurs vetting info. So ya, in many ways bitcoin is difficult. But Gavin and many others have been pervading bitcoin BIG TIME. IT IS AMAZING HOW BITCOIN HAS PERVADED IN JUST 6 YEARS!!!! 
Bitcoin core is necessary for bitcoin to work, but not everyone needs to run it. So if you go with  peoplma comment, you should be fine. I often use blockchain.info, without giving them my email address or anything extra. So as long as I keep my password and download the convenient backups, I'm pretty safe, since none of my bitcoin private keys are seen by blockchain.info, and I don't have a secondary signin backdoor, via my email. Sorry so long, what Peoplma said sounds good. Good luck! Bet on Bitcoin!!

Dude, you are not alone. I preach bitcoin and most people don't care. Same with gold. Not to mention I get absolutely shunned for preaching that Christianity is wrong and the government is the enemy. People don't give counter arguments usually. They see me be right as the price of gold and bitcoin compound, and they still don't believe they are where their money should be. A lot of the bitcoin believers are the same attitudinally. Reading the comments on your post for example, I don't think they get how special bitcoin is. I say it is so great, we need to let people know flat out that we think they need to consider it ASAP. I tell people that I don't want them to be able to come back to me later and ask why I didn't emphasize bitcoin more. We don't need to tell people twice, but if we care about them, we better tell them once, with emphasis. And to the people on this thread talking about bitcoin as if it's a mixed bag, how could we have hoped for a better pervance (spread)? Bitcoin has grown big time. Everything about bitcoins growth has been above my wildest expectations, except for the price. I TOTALLY don't understand why the price is so low. BTW, I haven't gotten rich off of bitcoin yet.

Some of the trolling is by the bullies who support the mods.
I've wondered if downvotes can be easily manipulated. I've seen a comments have lots of upvotes, then lots of downvotes.

Yes, that's all correct. You can keep a copy of the paper wallets.
Thanks a ton for the tip; that's exciting!!
For some more verification, I'll list below, the check sum of the bitaddress.org.html file that was listed a month ago, when I was working with it. And I see at  it is still listed as the same check sum. I didn't run the check sum on the bitaddress.org.html file this time, but it can be helpful to know they are still reporting the same check sum; so it's less likely something malicious has happened with bitaddress.org. Here it is:
@_date: 2015-10-03 13:26:05
bitaddress.org is often used. You can just go to bitaddress.org and print the paper wallets, or better yet, and I'm not an expert, but do this stuff lots, 
1) Goto bitaddress.org
2) Click on GitHub Repository link at bottom of page. Verifying that it really does take you to a  address.
3) Now, on the GitHub repository page, click the “Download ZIP” button, and download it.
4) You can verify the download, by clicking on the following link, that's also on the GitHub page:   The first post you see on that link, gives you instructions on verifying the download.
5) Save the download to a thumb drive.
6) Burn a linux iso.
7) Boot to the linux iso, without any internet connection. This way you are safe from the Internet and from computer viruses.
8) Now you can open the bitaddress download, and open the file “bitaddress.org.html”
9) Print your paper wallets. I always print three copies, for backups.
You can copy the bitcoin addresses, just like regular text, even though they are vertical, so you'll want to do that, if you're camera's not working for the QR codes.
If you are going to take back bitcoin you give someone, make sure you warn them first, because a lot of people will just keep the paper wallets indefinitely, to store their bitcoins, and could be shocked in 40 years when they try to import their paper wallet, to find out their bitcoins are gone. 
Best luck!!

Yes you can spend on both chains at once, it's called a replay attack. So if there's a fork, and I try to send bitcoin to somebody's old btc address, they or anyone could take that transaction I sent and replay it on that same address on the bcc fork. So to avoid it, we need to only use wallets that will prevent it. Come to think of it, you might be right about bcc, cause they have built in replay protection, but some forks haven't. So maybe my point is moot.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:09:26
That is not a complete answer. For example if BCC is the coin to get, you should be prepared to sell your BTC and buy BCC. Also, you need to know how to spend BTC and BCC without spending both at once. And maybe there's more to know.

Could you send the balance in your Coinbase bitcoin wallet to your Coinbase USD wallet? The price of bitcoin will probably go way down, and you could work on using those dollars to buy from elsewhere. 
And for what it's worth, something strange might be afoot. Coinbase is making this suicidal decision; so is Bitstamp; maybe the government is behind it; two dark markets were shut down; one dark market closed by itself; a huge mixing service shutdown; the government arrested the BTCE exchange guy and five others.
