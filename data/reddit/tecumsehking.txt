Ultimate conspiracy thought experiment: shut down the btc network the same days Greece goes full blown category 5. As the dominos fall, btc is dead in the water. More transactions on the network jam it up further.  
Why else wait until Monday?

If it's anything like the USA gold confiscation it means when you open your safe deposit box there is a sheriff watching you. Anything inside the state deemed to be not yours the sheriff takes. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 02:54:26
They post a police officer in every bank who is present when you open your box. This is how the USA confiscated gold back in the day.

Thanks for that. That's what I found via search as well. I should have clarified I was wondering if anyone had actually seen one in person there, as those articles are old. I'm going to call them tomorrow.

On July 5th at 1:22 pm PDT I withdrew 1.02 btc from them. Went through fine.
Though I did have a small hiccup changing my withdraw address. I had submit a ticket and send a photo of my DL before they would let me change it. Despite being level 3 verified for over a year. 
However through that process the email responses all came back within an hour and it was done on the same day.

ELI5 why knowing the keys to the receiving addresses makes it "easier to clean up"?
...though I know there are some aspects of Bitcoin that are impossible to ELI5. Sorry if this is one of them.

The screenshot was cut because I couldn't fit the whole email in one picture.  I was sharing the fact that it happened and left it up to the people to assume a work around had been put in place.  Silly me I suppose, I'll be more clear next time.

Ahhh there it is. I did indeed miss the "billed at the end of the month".
Ps. This sub is under attack via massive down voting of every post. I lurk here often and have never seen such low "points" values on posts as I do now. In the "new" catagory when I posted this most were 0 or well in to the negative. I know because I upvoted every post that was 0 and only a couple registered. Given the drama lately this feels like a good way to kill a sub. It'll be interesting to see if it works.

I'm just posting for discussion. I like Bitcoin but I always assumed micropayments were not possible with credit cards due to fees. But apparently they are. So now I feel like a huge plus to bitcoin has been made in to a small plus, or maybe an equal.

Its not illegal but policy based. Last I heard Chase was the only one confirmed that prohibits it. Though there may be others as well.

Adam Smith wrote two books about capitalism. The well known "Wealth of Nations" and the ignored "Theory of Moral Sentiments". What you refer to is the result of business schools only teaching from one of the two books. Capitalism when practised with morals leads to things like the Carnegie libraries, free hospitals, fully funded cancer research centers and a strong and thriving middle class. It also lifts the standard of living for all classes to higher and higher levels over time.    ...when practised with moral sentiment, that is.
