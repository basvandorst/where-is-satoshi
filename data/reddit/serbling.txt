This. I bought 1000 vtc at .4 sold it all at 1.8 and was happy  but i couldve  made 4 times 3 times  that had i waited  2 extra weeks.  As has been said many times, people  that got rich were the holders.

Just a matter  of adoption. Rn its 100% speculation. &amp; bitcoin  cant really be used for purchases so heh.

Your 250K a year rn will be 90k a year in a year. Its better to just throw 1M into crypto honestly..
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:18:16
That sounds like a 200k  investment though. Unless you are a multi milionaire its probably a mistake.

Let your people  use 10+ exchanges. Easy. Why is this  even a question.

Highly depends on the ground tbh. You can buy a massive  plot of land for a few K in many countries.  Setting up in a western country would be stupid.

If you flash enough cash without  mob ties sooner or later someone will  put a gun to your head or your house will be broken into. A bitcoin millionaire is even easier to rob.

Yea, people live of 2-300 a month. If you put 40k down in a fund you can basically  retire there any age you wish. Im probably going to retire in very soon. We got ground and a house in bosnia, can live there for free(internet and electricty needs to be paid). Only need to buy sugar and some other stuff once  in a while.

I was very  poor back then. I found about 3 litecoins i had bought for 5$ each.  Was a nice  surprise a few months back.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:59:47
You couldve bought 20 litecoin a month a few months back and x3 your money which wouldve netted you a 4 digit number. Its not too late.

Wait you calling  me out  for bunch of judgements without facts without  doing any such thing  yourself? Sounds like you are the classic  redditor kek. The change when Trump came was marginal. Only difference is interaction between different  opinions on reddit, it doesnt exist anymore. One calls the other a russian spy and the other calls the other a commie. Kinda funny  when  both sides use the same tactics.
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:04:44
Its funny you say  1-2years... been on reddit for close to 10 years and it started really heavily around 5years ago and it only got worse. So, or you havent been around long so it makes  sense you didnt realise it earlier, or earlier you shared  the same  opinions as the  'hivemind' so you didnt notice. And honestly if you stay in the major subs  and only read top comments it means you basically only read paid content.
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:09:49
Just look at the events;
Assange; did nothing
Assange; no rapist
Assange; reveals crimes of the government.
Assange; oh yes hes a rapist, btw send him to a country  that can send him to the USA (where he can/could get a lethal injection for being a hero) even if hes not a rapist. 
I mean you have to be truly naive to believe  these things about  assange. +the rape charge  was about not using a condom iirc, so yea, if true, disgusting behaviour but imo not rape. You have to be truly  blind to see the rape case as something more than it is.
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:12:29
You and me damn well know  its just to get him to sweden so he could be send to america to get life sentence/lethal injection. That was literally  clear to anyone since the very  start. Just like with snowden, if you think that wouldve  been a fair trial you are truly naive. Its funny how one election result can brainwash so many people.
@_date: 2019-04-16 10:35:11
Whats the sequence of events to you then?
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:10:29
But you also forget the inmense risk you get by buying a house.  You are stuck there. If the market  turns south and you  cant sell you are fucked. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:03:56
Your numbers  are obviously  not realistic  unless you got lucky buying a house. But  you  should never  ever in your lifr buy  a house thinking it will double in just 10 years.  Even in this highly unrealistic scenario not buying with cash gives you more money. Since you can; VTI. Safe option will give you 10%. So
100*1.1^10= 260k. You can also buy  4, 100k houses. Lets say they rent 500 a month you can go  and retire in the third world.  Never ever use your own money  if the interest  is lower than ur profit.
@_date: 2018-11-14 09:29:32
Are you 12?
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:18:41
But putting money down will simply net you way more.  100k will reach nearly  2milion in 30 years in a VTI. No way your house will have  that value. More money, more freedom, more potential. You  can also put the 100k as a downpayment for 4 100k houses that you  could  rent out . 
@_date: 2018-11-14 09:30:45
If someone convinces you via email to kill people you should be locked up anyway kek
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:12:47
With a basic VTI you'll outperform your house and your money wont locked in a house. Always get the debt if your investments pay off more than the interest.

They literally caught him with  an open laptop. There was proof and tons of it.
@_date: 2018-11-14 09:28:36
Not comparable at all tho.  He 100% didnt rape  them. Its 100% on record Ullrich  was he who was &amp; did what he did.
@_date: 2018-11-14 09:25:23
Tbh. The guy was 100% guilty no doubt.  Does he deserve 2 life sentences? Nah. Does he deserve 20 years? 100%. It should be a wake up call but  the court  is rigged just like international courts. Where the nazi's guilty? Yes. Did the process go fair? Not even remotely. Same with Yugoslavia tribunal, are those people guilty? Yes. The process itself was fully rigged always. And if you  are a nobody your lawyer will strike a deal with  his buddy  whos the lawyer on the other side.
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:13:56
You love him for ignoring the fact  that hes missing the entire point? Hes just throwing numbers without realising one of the very  basics. If you can borrow money and get more than the % is worth  out of it. You  always  take  the debt. Why would  you pay 100k in one go if you can pay 100k in 30years over 2.5% while you make 10% a year on that money. If you put  down your 100k for 30 years you have  1,7MILION. The chances of your  house of 100k to reach 1.7M in 30 years  in slim. Very slim.

The air will clear. This is not even remotely close to a 'bad' crash.

Many western  countries force you to work without pay to get your degree.  Work 6 months 40hours a week for 100$ per month+20hours of school a week. Its really impossible to work another job and stay sane.

Its because he bought the  company that was making the medicine.  I think  right now the company  is barely making a profit. Its not like their stocks exploded because all that  juicy cash is coming.

He probably  wont go. Maybe a few  months.
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:50:01
Hes wrong tho. Very simple math. Lets just use 100. Your house you pay 2.5% so 2,5€ in debt a year. If you  take this debt  and invest your 100 and make 5% a year you get 5€ a year.  You pay off the 2,5€ debt and keep 2,5€. And you can get 10%+ a year out of vanguard. So you basically lose 7.5% profit a year by using your cash.

If he hired hitmen to kill your father mother brother son /whatever you'd be singing a different  story. It was basically a spoiled child  who became rich via drugs and his already spoiled ego became even worse. He doesnt deseverve life maybe but 20 years is the minimum imo.

Many people  who have no clue  are stepping in right now. I even have an amount  of FB Friends  who are getting into it(bragging about a 300$profit) . really they just think theyll get rich  quick. When bitcoin stagnates  or drop a 100 or maybe  even 50 these people  will  panick. The market will take a hit.
