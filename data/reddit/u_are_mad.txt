And enjoy the peace of mind knowing ether has inherent value unlike Bitcoin which will eventually fail because it's only use is a sToRE oF vALuE.

Because it's fucking true. Hop off the bitcoin train before it's moving 100mph straight off a cliff.

Google was actually better than its competitors though.

You're obviously jealous of rich people. You should be thanking the Winklevoss twins because they are supporting bitcoin, thereby raising the price and assuming you are invested, helping you out. When they eventually sell they're not getting rich off poor people - they're getting rich off idiots who wait till bitcoin is 100,000 to buy.

When the rate of price increase passes the speed of light, time starts moving backwards.

Don't listen to the other people. They're trying to overcomplicate things. The easiest way to buy Bitcoin is to use C++ with the libcurl, rapidjson, and libcrypto++ libraries to interface with the Coinbase Rest API and issue a Limit Buy order. Just make sure you install a lightning node on your copy of the blockchain in order to channel the TCP request using the MD5 Hash of your private key.
