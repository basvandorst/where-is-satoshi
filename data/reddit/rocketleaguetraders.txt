Well I been holding for a while, i put money on various types of assets bitcoin being my favorite one because no one knows where its heading and to me that's the fun of it, owning bitcoin is like owning something that has value to me I dont care if it drops or skyrockets. 11 years from now ill  be cashing out my bitcoins if I live that long thatb is...never know if I get into an accident or something. Good luck bud
