Other eurozone countries don't by default (no pun intended) make up the Greek loss - Greek sovereign bonds are held by other countries, financial institutions and hedge funds globally, the risk is global. The nominal value of derivatives on Greek debt would not be nearly as high as 700T, and even if it were, this does not represent how much investors are on the hook to lose in the event of a default. 
You also may be forgetting that because Greece's problems have perpetuated for such a long time, it's likely that a significant portion of the nominal debt has been insured through credit default swaps, further spreading the credit risk globally.
Argentine defaulted recently, it didn't have an impact on the global capital markets. Greece is unlikely to as well, otherwise the market would be significantly more volatile than it is with people speculating on which way the outcome is going to fall.

Greece is an insignificant economy in the eurozone, there will not be any 'domino effect'

Why wouldn't you invest in something with less downside risk? 
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:30:52
You think you do?

Okay, I'll ask you some easy questions then. On what collateral is the value of a bitcoin unit worth? To give you some direction - the value of a dollar used to be backed by gold when the US was on the gold standard. President Nixon ended the gold standard in the 70s. Now the US dollar has value because it is bonded by the federal reserve, which has not defaulted on its ability to redeem debt. What is supporting the value of bitcoin other than pure supply and demand?

This is a bad idea. Why wouldn't you instead hold some other currency with less downside risk? 
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:47:29
You think that bitcoin will soundly store wealth over time?

That's what everybody said before the dotcom bubble hahaha

Never got back to my question?

It can't be a gold like asset because it doesn't have a tangible value - the value is driven by market demand. This is no different to any other currency - if it's used for economic activity and for trade then demand for the currency will determine the fair value of a unit. UNLESS it is backed by gold - in which case the value of the currency is backed by a central bank's gold reserve.
If nobody wants bitcoins, they are worth zero dollars. You can't say the same for gold- backed currencies. Bitcoin is a made up currency. Saying it can be a gold-like asset is like saying a central bank can stockpile Bitcoin to support the value of its own currency, which is erroneous.

Except it cannot become a gold-like asset...its a fiat currency

You guys are crazy 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:08:30
No - you're doing the math incorrectly 
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:45:42
You're wrong - the way that the spot is being quoted is actually reflecting the value of a US Dollar measured in Rubles.
I just wrote CFA level 3 on Saturday, I'm extremely familiar with forex

No worries! Just a small nuance. Thanks for sharing the info, very interesting 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:04:45
You need to calculate this using USD as the price currency, what you've just calculated is the appreciation of USD relative to RUB which is incorrect.

Bitcoin doesn't have a market cap - it's not a company and does not have cash flows. It's a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:20:28
Who cares 
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:11:21
No they can't - banks have the ability to diversify risk in ways that decentralized lending could not. This is why countries with weak banking systems always have poorer economic growth

Just because somebody likes an asset isn't effect for having done research

Suppressed relative to what..???

Bitcoin is a commodity, you can't compare it to a business

Based on what logic can you conclude that gold is underpriced relative to anything? Risk of inflation in the US is low right now - interest rates likely to rise which will increase FDI and cause USD to continue appreciating
