This is always conveniently forgotten by usd oligarchs that want to argue their fiat case. USD is the most crooked currency on the planet.

Has not aged well. good try.

I agree, but it will only take 100's of million other people to agree to get anywhere.  We'll get there eventually.

I know i don't have too, but i want to because i like the idea of having control over my own money. But it comes with big responsibility. Most aren't ready or the tech is not right yet for mainstream like myself who's trying.

This is why Fun Fair's market  share will slowly increase. They will end up being one of the most legit crypto gambling sites on the chain.  Slow and steady wins the race.

Waiting for when we have a 10% drop so I can see it falling back to earth.
