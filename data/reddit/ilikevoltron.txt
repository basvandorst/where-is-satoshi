I gave up after a few days, I think I got an email after sending in a request that went to my spam folder.

Gemini: Type my bank password and username? Why in the world do people think this is acceptable?

Maybe it'll be like what Amazon does for independent writers? Dunno, I feel like there's more than zero bands who got their start without a label. I'd mostly agree though, as of now it's the exception not the rule.

Yea, Gemini, the company that expects me to hand over my credentials to my bank! Seriously though, their bank verification process is the worst I've ever used.

It's embedded in the CPU, it's not a separate management interface like a typical IPMI/iLO/iDRAC connection is, that typically requires some setup on the admins side (and is entirely controllable by the admin). Worst case, you can just unplug the physical interface.

So there are other QR scanners, but none of them hook into a decent and easy to use bitcoin client (that I know of). I ended up using one I found on the app store.. "QR Journal" to grab the text for a address, and then paste that into Electrum. Which sucks, but it works.

Pretty sure it'll import the wallet into 2.0 because I opened up the beta and had transactions still.

$32 USD in rent? holy shit...

Is it just me or is the lacking QR code scanner a major PITA on Windows/Mac?
