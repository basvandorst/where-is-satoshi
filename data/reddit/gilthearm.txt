It was clearly written with a lower scale intent.  Which is fine, truly.  But keep in mind, this person's hobby either ruined them of turned them into a huge thief.

A: Management. I was too busy and couldn’t lay out an adequate corporate structure. I wish I had five of me, as I was too busy with meetings with banks, lawyers and business partners. That was all painful, **I wish I had more time to do engineer-type of work**.
THIS.  This is the single most important reason why this bullshit failed.  It's also the SINGLE most complained about issue the STAFF (I'm a staff, not manager) those on my current team have about our managers - they "wish" they were still software developers.  They pretend to "dislike" the promotion to manager, puff their chests and then when shit hits the fan, they pretend to just want to be developers again. 
PICK ONE ROLE AND DO THAT FUCKING ROLE.

Great.  Next story to appear: Drug dealers use WU and Bitcoin to send money overseas for the funding of cartels.

Really? It's not confusing to me.  I understand what an ASIC is. And I understand what the company name is. Because I choose to write a short version of the company name is not confusing people who can read the entire context of my reply. 
ASIC ASIC ASIC.   Eat a dick.  
ASIC.

I don't fully understand - I thought the transaction fees were for the block miners to split.  So, if this is true, did ASICMiner just take a 200 BTC hit to help someone recover?
@_date: 2013-08-29 17:51:23
Gotcha! I did not get it or understand that ASIC mined the entire next block.  Makes sense! Thanks!!
@_date: 2013-08-29 15:39:26
Right but I mean to say that if the miners split the 200 BTC fee, and that fee was replaced in the original sender's wallet (by ASIC) then ASIC effectively "funded" the monies that the miners split.  Not saying it is good, bad, right or wrong, just curious about the Fee portion.
Also, thank you for your response. :)

One little 'benefit' to going to court with whatever issue around the bitcoin world : judges and court communities get to hear more about bitcoin.

Then again if he just had the address on a piece of paper, he could easily trash or destroy that paper and say your "I sent this to him" is crap as that's not "him" in any provable way.  If maybe you asked him to email you the wallet address, or you exchanged encryption keys, and he sent you an encrypted note with the address in it, it could be proven to be him by nature of the fact that it's a PITA to do all of that "work".. Hrm.
