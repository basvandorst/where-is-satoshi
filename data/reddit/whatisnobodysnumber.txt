Noob speculators? I mean no fresh money will come in the market after these drops... A lot of old guys gonna leave the market as soon they can. So except on every pump a lot of shitload will be unloaded. Between these pumps the miners gonna unload their coins without any matter.
And still no new money flow into market, they’ve got their chance with potential but they chose the fast money, which will end up in insolvent markets...

SEC Never approve an ETF while these shitshows happen. They have enough shitshows on their own markets, another one would damage their reputation too much.

Sounds like a shorter that shorted the bottom, maybe again?
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:10:27
I think we’re at a point, the shorters get rekt with all together or only the shorters
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:24:40
The real reason is just, they do not want any exchanges that are operated by shady people. 
For example, take your coins and let them crash at other exchanges.

In simple words, the difficulty raises when much hashpower is used to mine bitcoins, it fells when less hashpower is used. And the accumulated means the relation of hashpower to adjusted difficulty.

Crypto withdrawal works mostly good on exchanges which are coin based... Fiat withdrawals is mostly a common problem on all coin based exchanges. But that is normal nobody with experience would withdraw fiat from coin based exchanges.
Mostly only permanent shorter which better don’t participate on crypto markets.

Never advise a bull run, the real advice may be “the results may vary”, and this is a real advice. But if you can’t afford don’t trade. Hodl or sell, shorts aren’t the answer at this times.

Can’t believe that they are so slow I’ve traded there for years as a Platin trader and never got any delays. Maybe because it was problematic to verify your Identity.

We’re at an oversold record status, what do you think?
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:07:33
We was at a record oversold status so the correction was overdue, but 2015 happened a very similar case we’ve seen there a hidden bullish divergence, where the people thought they can short more, but it went wrong the price went up.
I am very pissed off, because I’ve sold at the first resistance and now I really don’t know if it happens again. But 2015 there was a chance to get almost the bottom price again. But no one knows in fact.

Could not is, ... this price could already be the bottom. Nobody knows in fact. But when we look at the history where crypto died already minimum 9 times, could that be the price +- 1k.

Do we go to 3k or nobody realize the maybe inverse head’n shoulder pattern? If we go there, we are proof, that we’re all idiots, because we don’t realize the opportunity we’ve got...

@_date: 2018-12-08 22:08:39
As first don’t think futures are good for Bitcoin, they aren’t. An ETF, maybe. But crypto doesn’t follow the Wall Street so it will go up maybe not today not tomorrow and maybe not next week but it will, when it’s a question like “when lambo” or when “when moon”. Actually should it gets a corrective rally but it could after it fall further but not below 2.5 K (and I don’t think it will go to that price without correction) it’s more likely we go to be in a price narrative between 3.5 K and 3.2 K without a real correction rally) with a correction we could go up to 4 K again and bottom out on 2.7 K after some weeks. From there on only slow upwards until the real bull run.
