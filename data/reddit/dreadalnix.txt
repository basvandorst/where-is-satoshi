He didn't try to fight bitcoin, he tried to scam in the IPO. He never supported or cared for any bitcoin forks, anything for that matter. He is like the mobster trying to come out clean by virtue of scamming even more.
I bet that if he fails to pump BAB and get actual buyers, he is going to serve jail time in China.
As we speak, BAB is falling apart.

Don't forget that he is shilling Avalanche protocol for BCH while he will launch the AvA coin with this protocol. BCH became a complete scam.

Absolutely yes. r/btc is a bitmain shilling power house.
RV absolutely needs to go down with jihan.

McAffe only said that bitcoin would reach 1 million because he was mining it and wanted to dump it on his followers, it is really not difficult to understand this.

I really like the new name better, BAB, it is more fitting since it is an ABC pet project backed by jihan "IPO scam" wu. Bcash is actually not a bad name, it is too gentle for the pile of scum that r/btc, roger ver, bitcoin.com and jihan are.

Short relevant comment: deadalnix, BAB (bcash) lead dev, is pushing Emin's avalanche [broken^1 ] consensus in BAB, what makes BAB yet another (even bigger) scam used by Sirer to promote himself.
^1 not difficult to find references showing the consensus is broken if your reddit-fu is good enough, but most won't naively give away all of them to help such people.

LOL is a failed miner and a [vaporware dev]( Very similar level to Rizun's [attention-whoring disorder](
And if you really want to take a look at how pitiful these "developers" are, [look no further](

Well fucking said!
These fake libertarians want to get away with everything because their coin is the "truth" in their mind. Sounds pretty much like any other jihadist crap.

BAB devs are now openly admitting their roadmap is dumb: 
Do you see ANY discussion of it in r/btc?
**I mean, they are simply contradicting their entire fucking narrative and existence purpose**!  They were caught in "adoption" frauds over and over. This is financial fraud 101, usually people go to JAIL for things like this, so you are far too kind in your depiction of what RV really is.

Somewhat related to BTC: BAB lead dev now admits his roadmap is dumb: 
I wonder what RV/bcashers.com that cried out loud about "on-chain scaling" and generated the fork think about it. Meh, BAB really is over.
