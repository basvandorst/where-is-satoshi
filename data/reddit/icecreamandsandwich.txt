the market is experiencing a very tough until now and most probably the halving can be by next year where we can expect a really high pump or surge. So its good to hodl our asset now and wait patiently till the market turns green and we can expect a good profit if this happens.

Craig Wright? Who said he's Satoshi? That guy is fake just like what his project is, I don't know what's with his attitude of insisting of self proclaim. That's why his shit project got delisted in some exchanges. Still, satoshi unknown brother..

Know some people who still mine Bitcoin instead of alts since alts price isnt really that much profitable.
@_date: 2019-06-14 12:18:53
Without bitcoin, you wouldn't even know that blockchain exists and bitcoin is not that bad. it gives you profits.
