i thought there was still problems with JL's quadratic hashing solution?

the problem here is that if Bitcoin is to be Money, then Blockstream should not be in a position to control it.  like the Fed.
but if you think Bitcoin is to just be about smart contracts, i guess no problem.  then Bitcoin won't be anything special.

the problem is you don't think Bitcoin can work as is.

you really are a stubborn cuss, aren't you?  you think that just b/c you throw around a fancy term like "bearer asset" in the same context as Bitcoin that it makes it cash?  lol, that term is only used in the context of real cash, you know, something that is widely accepted and believed in by all, aka, a collective agreement, which it isn't.  and since Bitcoin is internet based, that really means it needs wide acceptance as cash by people worldwide, which it isn't.  yes, it extinguishes once confirmed, but if it's only used by 100K geek groupies, it is NOT CASH.  and don't go scream LN!  b/c that is not a "bearer asset" layer b/c it involves "smart contracts" which don't extinguish immediately but exist over time as defined by the counterparties.  plus, it is less secure b/c as Rusty said, you'll need to hire a monitoring service to prevent your counterparty from publishing a previous tx that steals money from you, then forcing you to publish the revocation tx.  that costs money and has it's own risk, nothing that a true "bearer asset" would have.
so yes, b/c you've relegated Bitcoin to a settlement layer is VERY relevant to this conversation as it simultaneously precludes it as being CASH.  sorry to disappoint you.

But you're equating Bitcoin to *cash*, which it ISN'T, remember? You've relegated it to a settlement layer which means it only has value for moving large amounts, if it will even do that, given that it never gained worldwide acceptance first as a digital form of gold or currency.

it's only money if it is collectively accepted as money by all people's, the smallest subgroup being at the nation state or internet level.  but it isn't yet, not even on the internet, and it won't be as long as it's crippled at 2TPS.  don't scream LN, b/c that is only a smart *contracting* system whose channels don't extinguish immediately and are less secure b/c of the need for either self monitoring or by hiring a monitoring service, which costs money itself (a property that a true cash does NOT require).

i've seen you complain about that guy before.  who is he, b/c it certainly seems you let him get into your panties?
@_date: 2016-09-30 16:58:23
problem is, no one wants to b/c it's so illiquid.  no one thinks of it as cash except for a few thousand geeks.
edit:  thanks for the rate limiting r/bitcoin!

Lol, he just did
