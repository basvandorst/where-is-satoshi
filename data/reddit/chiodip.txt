So you are saying he burnt 850k of bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:59:51
wow, now we are getting some unknown personal bitcoin blogs as source?
looks like FUD for me...

I would take out my stolen 20 BTCs and give back the rest. Maybe I would also keep some unclaimed coins. But why would I need hundreds auf thousand of *stolen* bitcoins?

You still need to launder that money. You think you can buy a 100$ mio dollar appartment and a private jet without any feds coming by for a coffee? ;)

I would also be rich with 10k bitcoins... Nobody can spend 850k worth of stolen btcs

Lost around *11k Euros* in total
*~10 BTCs* and 5500 € in withdrawals pending...
I'm a student and my money on Bitcoin was every *last dime* I had. I was about to withdraw all the money and convert them to fiat right before MtGox went down early Feb, but now I'm left with a *huge debt* and I don't know how my life is going on now. I can't remember any time I felt *nauseous like this morning*, when realizing what happened. I actually had hope until the last second, but now I'm realizing how fu*ked I actually am...
Compared to figures like 4000 BTCs my loss seems not like much, but this were *my whole savings* I had... so for me it is a life changer...
it's not like I'm going to *suicide*, by for the first time in my life I thought about it for a couple of minutes...

still no withdrawal possible. please all panic sell.

I hope some day I can see it as a lesson learnt. Right now I have to check to get over this first... I think I need a couple of days to get my head clear and straight again.
I wouldn't consider myself greedy. But I obviously had trust in the wrong company/people.

Just checked my account and my fiat amount (EURO) on my wallet is just vanished.
I had most of my EUROs withdrawn in end January 2014 (SEPA) - but never received anything on my bank account. But still my fiat balance on MtGOX is 0!
