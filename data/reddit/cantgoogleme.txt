Didn't say there was. They can, however, easily influence it's ability to replace fiat.

The government likes the power of printing money too much to let bitcoin take over.

Three years from now you can use the bitcoin to buy a cybertruck.

I can pay at my grocery store using Apple Pay and my watch without looking and without taking a device out of my pocket. It’s super convenient.

"no fees" isn't exactly true. they charge a spread.

When you buy, the $ price per bitcoin they charge is higher than what you might pay elsewhere. The difference is how they make their money.

Never claimed that there wasn’t a credit card involved. 
I was commenting that the Apple Pay nfc is more convenient than scanning a qr code to initiate a transaction.
