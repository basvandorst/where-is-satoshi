Returns are reimbursed with store credit? Considering how often the Newegg RMA experience is less-than-ideal (to put it mildly), I don't know that I want store credit should something go wrong, instead of my money back.

It doesn't look like you get rewards using this though. That's a big deal breaker for me.

I couldn't help but notice you left Android out, since your statement applies to Linux, can I assume it applies to Android as well?

I can't really say much about iOS wallets, other than to say I  downloaded bread and bitwallet, haven't had a lot of use for them yet, and don't plan storing a lot of value in either.
I'm in a similar situation: My dad wants to learn more about cryptocurrencies and play with them, but he has iOS devices and a barely used Celeron D-powered XP computer.
And no, he won't switch to Android, he's been there, done that, doesn't want to go back.

And since it's new, it gets better weighted in the results 
Why is there? Because money .
