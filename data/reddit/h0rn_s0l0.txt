I can!

I noticed that too...

It's also another word for peanut.

Yep. Cash App if it drops while I wait.

Have you tried Coinbase Pro? You have to wait a few days for funds to transfer from your bank, but the fees are lower. Also Cash App is lower and instant.

My first comment was deleted. We'll see if this one is.

It was like $15 worth. But I'm not doing a lot of spending at the moment.

I tried this, both using the desktop site, and the coinbase app and both times, coinbase pro says there is a hold on the funds when I try to deposite from my coinbase USD wallet.

If I worked hard and lived below my means to pay off a loan for 10 years to suddenly be working to pay off others' loans, I'd be pissed too.

The anger isn't at the people benefiting, it *is* at the system. The system that forces people to pay for loans taken out voluntarily by others.

Why not? As long as they pay me for that info. 
I've used it for a few months and cashed out in BTC successfully.

Count me in.

Chaotic Neutral was a good stopping point. I upvoted anyway.
