Yes buy low is the point. But the word 'fear' makes it interesting

I WILL FIGHT WITH MY UPVOTES!

Trust me. It's not only the LoL community that doesn't 'get it'. There is still a lot of work to be done in the protocol itself and in promoting Bitcoin's use. Regardless, cryptos are only getting bigger until they replace fiat.

is the decentralized internet going to end in .bit/ ? :)
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:24:57
Yes, but this one is particularly bad.

I can't open an account on itBit from Peru - South America. Don't understand why.. support says they don't accept Peruvian citizens or Peruvian companies. Meanwhile Peru is one of the countries included in the TTP...

I think it is a business tactic to prevent other bitcoin processors from contacting their clients. It was very useful though. I wish it comes back

So sorry man :l
i wonder if scammers can live peacefully knowing they screwed people or knowing they would have made more money being legit..

Been to 2020 as a hackathon participant. Couldn't stay for Nasdaq's Linq demo. Would love to see it too. If anyone can post a link to it, it'd be great

I got paid $260~ in bitcoin from one client by doing freelance on reddit marketplaces last year. I did movie-like subtitles for some videos that taught spanish viewers how the IRS worked =P

Sorry to hear that :l I was in a dogecoin marketplace, but got paid in bitcoin and some in dogecoin. It was either or . I did put my work at risk though. I received a small advance, worked, then received the rest. I guess dogecoin's community has less scammers, maybe?. With that said, I'm all about using escrows or freelance websites to make the process more secure and fast for both parties
