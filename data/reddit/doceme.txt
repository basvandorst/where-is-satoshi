I can confirm that I am seeing the same problem on my Nexus 5. My phone has been getting hot for no reason and I have tried many things to figure out what is causing the excess battery drain. Battery usage under settings showed that "Android System" was the heaviest hitter. After uninstalling just the Circle app yesterday, the change was dramatic.  Definitely something up with the Circle app.

Before. Halving happens every 210000 blocks, so the next one is at block 420000.

It's a little pricy, but I'm running mine on an IFC6410 board with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (APQ8064) with 2GB RAM. The 6410Plus is the newer version of this board:

FWIW, mine was increased without me asking.

I agree, except for the incentive of not having to give my CC # over the internet to a company that might get hacked and cause me grief.

Great summary. Very helpful.
