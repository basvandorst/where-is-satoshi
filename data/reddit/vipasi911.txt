Sorry about that dude, I don’t know why not more people are talking about this!
For some people that downvoted, I guess they support scammers

I Hope they implement something to help ��

so if they rolled up with guns to all the major facilities at once, it’s hard to believe they can’t do damage. Why don’t we just change it to a more real time or fewer blocks readjustment?

Its easier to reach consensus with 50 people than it is with 50,000. I'd like to see people go tell the U.S to reduce their $20 trillion debt.

I'm gonna post it at r/btc and see what they think

Once you raise the block size you're never gonna be able to bring it back down. The most important thing is decentralisation. Increasing blocks and centralizing the network is reckless. There is no block chain police to say 10MB is enough, 100mb is enough, even when it's too much at that point in time. Until one day someone says "oh shit blockchains too big we're too centralized now, and at that point u go down like the titanic there is no reroll... I agree that if we try second layer and it doesn't work we can raise the block size. But second layer will work. It's so obvious I don't even know what to tell you.

Please enlighten me then.

It's open source, don't give me FUD about blockstream please, just because the majority of developer consensus is with segwit doesn't make it centralize, It makes it obvious!!! There are always gonna be minority developers who are not as onto it.

Syncing to the digibyte network takes me days... if big blockers get there way it's gonna take months! "Ain't no body got time for dat". oh,
Except centralized institutions that can be shut down, and governments

Yea sure, I'm seeing 400MB websites all the time. If scaling becomes a matter of increasing blocks that's where it'll get to
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:40:55
Sure if you wanna spend an arm and a leg for it haha
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:54:30
