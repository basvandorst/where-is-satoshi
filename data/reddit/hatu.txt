I'm honestly curious how are people day trading Bitcoin. What are you analyzing to base your trading on? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:39:48
I can't imagine anyone would use their platform after this. Would you?
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:49:07
Limited Liability Company. It's right there in the name. It's still valid to ask how far are the owners willing to go to solve the situation but legally they are in the clear to just let it go bankrupt.

Wait till you find out about stocks!

And I'm pretty sure the wife just rolled her eyes when she heard about this and bought groceries with Euros.

Good luck after the Galactic Empire implodes.

The US hegemony is at least as powerful as Spain or UK ever were so 20+ years? The dollar not being the reserve currency wouldn't be a disaster for the economy necessarily either - most of those countries are still among the biggest economies in the world.

Oh you get paid in US dollars? That's adorable. *tips fedora*

Being able to infinitely divide one remaining coin doesn't prevent a liquidity crisis. What if I want 50 coins to buy a car?
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:22:35
Besides if you only get a handful of people using BTC to your store, you're losing money already since you as the owner had to spend tens of hours of your valuable time researching what is Bitcoin, how to integrate it with your current system, how to put it to accounting etc.
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:35:29
Can you explain this a bit more? How is a finite currency better for a developing countries economy? When rich countries are printing cash, isn't it actually easier to catch up since their currencies are now that much less valuable
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:49:23
No it's not. He buys undervalued businesses that he researches like a maniac and knows the business inside out.
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:31:07
Just like the top 1% owning most of the wealth is irrelevant since we can just use the smaller bills and coins?
@_date: 2015-05-07 19:19:03
Oh yeah, because Bitcoins exchange rate hasn't plummeted rapidly for the last year.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:42:02
Past performance is not indicative of future results. You're basing this just on a belief.
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:08:59
I sure hope the super libertarians don't complain about the 1% if this sounds like an utopia to them.
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:33:22
How is it the best money if it's gonna appreciate ten thousand fold? A good gamble, sure.  
The price should be irrelevant, which is why I think it's good it stopped growing. A good currency is NOT supposed to be a good investment - it's supposed to be a good tool for trade.

Why would a adblock user start using a browser that has filtered ads when right now they're getting no ads?
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:23:58
I don't think Mt Gox for example unloaded the downward pressure in one day, this might still be partially because of that.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:16:01
But this is like printing a passport you found online and saying you're a citizen of that country now
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:44:11
That might be the worst sales tactic I've ever seen. This shirt costs 1000 US Dollars. 
  
(and by USD we mean pennies)
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:07:48
I guess you haven't actually looked at the data. The US has the highest gun ownership rate per capita so it should be the safest country in the world right? Oops, it's actually  on the most gun-related deaths per capita.  
Next point out how safe Switzerland is where owning ammunition is illegal.
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:41:15
It its the worst investment with 0% growth (in the local market). But it is the most liquid "investment" which is why people keep their money in dollars/euros.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:48:39
You know what, in your imaginary scenario US is the safest place on earth. Nicely done
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:49:31
Let's see off the top of my head, some troll links to a ISIS website and you click on it. Do you feel like you should be punished for that?
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:50:35
Oh that's a great idea, let's double the NSA efforts to spy on US citizens
@_date: 2016-11-10 19:15:26
It's already starting
@_date: 2016-09-01 14:31:06
Remember how long Gmail was in beta? It doesn't mean all that much these days since software is developed much more iteratively than 10 years ago.
@_date: 2016-09-09 23:41:44
That seems like an actually useful application since they can't accept cards due to banks declining their business
@_date: 2016-09-05 03:04:41
The US government would just dilute USD with inflation. It's very silly to think IRAs would get a haircut
@_date: 2016-09-27 23:41:17
Whatever the chip, won't miners just buy a butt load of them and keep on trucking with most of the hash power?

There was nothing smart about investing in Netflix in 1997. YouTube was 7 years out still. How would anyone have known that Netflix - a completely different business back then would lead the streaming race 15 years later
@_date: 2016-10-18 21:40:53
Oh man, that answer was straight from Trumps playbook. Political discourse in this country has certainly gone to shit
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:53:48
If I had to bet, my money would be on a short-term downward pressure IF whoever bought them just tries to cash out.
@_date: 2015-11-30 05:48:39
And infinity% from its launch
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:48:53
Which is fine, there's not a lot of exciting new discoveries in CS. It's a hilarious show and I'm sure the writers are aware when they're taking the piss
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:04:13
If you're looking into saving it, just put into into an IRA (as a bonus you get a tax deduction). If you're looking to gamble-save then put it into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:10:32
I wouldn't call that a strength. Being e-gold is bound to fail since at some point people will realize it's pointless and pop the bubble. People should be building ways to use Bitcoins for it to succeed.

@_date: 2015-02-08 18:51:17
You're still tying your whole economy to one asset which is dumb. What if Bitcoin tanks by 50% again? It's kind of like all those oil economies that are struggling now that oil is down.
