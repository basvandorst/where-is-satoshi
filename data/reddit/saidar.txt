Thank you for checking. It's good to know it's something on their end and not my IP being flagged or something.

What does being divorced have to do with anything?

Then I guess your "son" is S.O.L. I'm divorced and now have 10 times the amount of money I had because I no longer have to support that bitch. 
But my guess is this is really just a lame attempt to get someone to tip you some Bitcoins. Better luck next time.

Keep in mind that their data is not always completely up to date. My last 2 cars were the same model just different years, a 2010 and 2013. I had just recently purchased the 2013 and I got a question which asked my year and make of my car, and it contained both a 2010 and 2013 option. I failed the validation the first time because I answered the 2013, but apparently they didn't have that updated information yet. The next time I tried I got that same question, so I picked the 2010 version and was able to make it through the validation.

I had the same problem on my Mac. My Windows machine will complete a full sync in a matter of hours, but I gave up after 3 days of syncing on the Mac.
