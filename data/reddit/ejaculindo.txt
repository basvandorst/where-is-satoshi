It actually is, bitcoin transactions are irreversible, our entire financial system is reversible. 
Governments can't do anything about cryptography, once it's done it's done, you can't have a legal recourse against mathematics.

Offchain solutions like lightning network. 


When bitcoin gets more relevant, hopefully we will get new players in the game to provide new ASIC hardware, like nvidia or amd.


The problem is that most of the privacy stuff decreases scalability, monero for example has enormous transaction size.


I don't know what you mean by addressed, by the nature of bitcoin it needs to keep growing, we have 1mb block size limit to keep it sane for now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:40:32
Bad idea, if you don't have the private key its not your bitcoin.

Not false, our entire financial system is **reversible**, bitcoin transactions are **irreversible**.


Neither the laws of mathematics, what a government could do to sha256? 


Yes, but nobody could do shit against cryptography, that's why bitcoin paper was published in a cypherpunk mailing list. 


If you are talking about ancap, it's all about property rights, as you said, our civilization is built upon property rights.

Yeah, you also don't get your coins back but the criminal gets punished. Isn't it better to have your private keys with you?
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:45:22


The difficulty to mine a block is flexible, it changes according so every block is mined in ~10 minutes, every block has a size limit of 1mb.
If i remember correctly, since the end of 2016 the blocks tend to be full of transactions (1mb size), so the blockchain can't grow any faster than now, unless we hardfork to higher the limit to 2mb or more. 


Keeping most of the low amount transactions offchain, using lightning network or technologies like that, we don't need every coffee transaction of millions of users to be forever in the blockchain.
Besides that, hardware is always improving, so 200gb in the future may be not that big. 


Well, maybe Dash or Zcash? I don't really know much about altcoins, but Monero solution is really good but it makes scalability difficult. 
Dash is fast, but we don't know what happens if the user base gets huge like bitcoin.

If you don't have the private keys it's not your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:59:56


No, it's always true. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:36:34


You just stopped the quote in the part that i explain why you probably wont get your coins back, well the criminal will get punished but you will lose your coins.,thats the point!
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:32:49
Ok i got you wrong, i agree with you.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:32:16


No thats not my point, the point is: if an exchange gets away with "your" coins you probably wont have them back.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:06:17
Not a problem.

Bitmain will attack bitcoin with patents on mining hardware, its time for a pow change guys.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:53:52
Bitcoin isn't even prepared for mass adoption, it`s difficult to use for the layman and we should wait for lightning etc... 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:53:01
Hmm interesting, i'm using amd fx hardware so i may be safe from cpu malware, i detached my ssd before booting into the live session, after i opened the bitaddress html i removed the live session pendrive, so i was running everything on ram, then i checked the private key.

Segwit is a scaling solution too btw, also shnorr signatures... After that we may talk about blocksize increase.

Well this theory isn't used in mainstream economics anymore after marginalism.




There is still a great debate over this tho, some economists (mostly marxists) still advocates for labor theory of value which is a intrinsic theory of value.

Not necessary, you can use hardware wallets or paper wallets.

They aren't advanced enough to do that type of thing, assuming bitcoin development stops and no quantum resistent signature is deployed you could do that in a few decades :)
