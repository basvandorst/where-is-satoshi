There's nothing linking the key or email address to The strongest evidence is the screenshot of the reddit pm's. This could be confirmed by the Reddit admins.
Edit: There are a couple of links to the email address. His Twitter reset email may be a match. And there is a domain he is known to have owned which returns the email address.

This is the central innovation in Bitcoin. The longest chain is valid. "Depending on hash rates" you can reverse transactions 100's of blocks old. "Depending on hash rates" you can perform a 51% attack censoring all transactions. But hashpower is very expensive and thus miners only use it in economically rational ways. You would need orders of magnitude more hashpower used within a small number of difficulty adjustment periods to gain on a (formerly) majority chain which is 100's or 1000's of blocks ahead.

The difficulty adjustment period is 2016 blocks. On average the minority chain will have to survive 1008 blocks before a difficulty readjustment, and the fewer that initial period, the less it will have adjusted for the next 2016 blocks.
In other words a minority chain will have to survive for at a minimum 4-6 weeks with blocks being found much less often than normal. Most likely it will never reach an adjustment period and it will die. Even if it does go through two adjustment periods, it will be hundreds or thousands of blocks behind the longer Bitcoin chain.
Taking a chain which is hundreds of blocks behind and bringing it ahead again has always been *theoretically* possible, it is just how Bitcoin is designed (for example reversing a transaction 100 blocks old). But it has never been a realistic issue, nor is it for Bitcoin Unlimited.

What is the basis of your claim?

Minority chain coins will be destroyed when hash power is insufficient to push through the difficulty adjustment period, and the mining reward is not enough to justify continuing with such high difficulty.

Assuming it gets through that period at all. Who is going to spend the approx $15,000 per block, for an average of 1008 blocks before for adjustment on the minority chain? That's over $15 million cost to keep it alive to the first difficulty adjustment, $30 million if the fork is optimized to happen at the start of a difficulty period.
