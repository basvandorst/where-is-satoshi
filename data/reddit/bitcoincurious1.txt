when I go to back up my wallet, I get to a screen where it says "enter all words separated by space" however no words appear, nor does anything happen when I press "next"
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:34:44
but in this scenario I was given a bit of grief because I downloaded the app, sent btc to the app then tried to send from the app but couldn't.  When I then went to make a backup I also couldn't do that so I was told "well you should have tried to make a backup prior to ever sending funds initially to the wallet"... something I didn't know.

Well now I never said I was a knowledgeable investor.  I'm off to bed, hopefully I'll wake up to a flurry of solutions your iOS guy comes up with.  Any chance of contacting him/her directly?  I know have one very valuable iphone. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:10:32
tried all of the above other than  doing that now.
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:27:17
can you please clarify on how to do this?  I cannot seem to back up my wallet.
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:52:03
there it is, I knew the android +1 was close at hand :)  Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:10:34
going to do that now.  will update shorty.
@_date: 2015-04-17 23:14:30
there is :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:30:07
I do appreciate the effort, trust me I'd love to use the app and send you some btc lol :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:01:52
It does indeed.  Exact same amount.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:41:50
no options, just one main account showing my balance.  I can see all the details of the transaction but other than changing currency views...

@_date: 2015-04-06 22:09:51
thanks - I've responded with all info and questions from the emails to both you and Oleg via email. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:12:05
sounds good, keep me updated please.
@_date: 2015-04-02 08:24:12
Online balance is exactly less the same amount I sent to the ios app.
The App is no longer available in the us store either.
balance in the app is exactly what I sent to the app wallet.
Nothing happens with I select the back up feature.
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:11:51
no change, same issue.
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:52:13
I will know this in the future for sure, as of right now the app will not let me make a back up copy.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:24:22
online wallet x to iphone mycelium wallet.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:58:42
I can't create a backup.
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:21:14
life could be worse!   Got the emails from your company, will respond shortly.
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:11:55
no change, same issue.
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:13:14
need to be able to send my bitcoins from mycelium somewhere for me to use anything else.
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:18:14
Fair enough.
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:00:14
this is the sort of frustrating thing that prevents mass bitcoin adoption.  I'm not dummy and my intention was not to keep bitcoins in a hot wallet for longer than an hour, but here we are.  At no point when I downloaded this app did it say - before we totally fuck up, make a backup key, oh but if you can't make one because this thing has so many bugs, then don't use it at all.   
IMO - those two bugs are a colossal fail on the part of apple and Mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 08:25:57
I won't, your help is appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:26:12
I do not have the option to enable expert mode in the ios app under settings.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:42:39
This might explain why it's no longer in the app store.  Kinda wish they had put a little blurb up somewhere.  I goggled the crap out of it before asking the sub.

@_date: 2015-04-02 09:30:32
this might be an idea.  Just so I don't totally fuck this up, can you be a bit more clear as to a step by step?  I just want to be ultra cautious.  what are your thoughts on this?
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:25:12
I've tried to send it to a couple different addresses. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:26:24
do you work for the company?  if so 1 - how did these two massive bugs get by your co-workers and 2 - what is the ETA for the update/bugfix?

when I go to back up my wallet or export my master key, I get to a screen where it says "enter all words separated by space" however no words appear, nor does anything happen when I press "next"
@_date: 2015-04-02 08:44:12
well, nice of them to toss the app through such rigorous testing before releasing.  Nice of the fine folks at Apple to proof read their work before putting it on the App Store.  *sigh*     
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:48:59
same thing happens when I attempt to backup / export from there.  I get to a screen where it says "enter all words separated by space" however no words appear, nor does anything happen when I press "next"
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:43:24
fair enough, your help is appreciated regardless.  11am on a Thursday and nobody picks up the office phone in Germany?  What if I were a big investor?
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:11:09
or simply a prompt when you first use the app.  Bubble pop up "it's recommended you create a backup prior to sending any btc to your wallet for the first time" 
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:48:21
I've been in touch with via email and reddit and I guess I'm basically in a wait and see mode right now.  Please if you can update me with some sort of solution or fix at the earliest possible moment one comes up.
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:50:54
in such a case a popup - or some sort of registration guide should prompt the user of this.  I'm by no means a dummie but I'm also not as advanced as others on this sub.  Making a backup before using any wallet should not be an implicit action, it should be explained to the consumer, not even explained, a very quick popup when you first open the app for the first time would have prompted me to do this.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:24:46
I didn't have any need to, this was my first transaction to the mycelium wallet.
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:38:41
thank you for your help everyone and I will sleep on this and let those others comment with the next steps but from my conceptual knowledge of everything this sounds like it should work.  Much appreciated.
@_date: 2015-04-14 00:05:33
Any updates ?
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:32:42


saw that today, thank you for looking out :)  Already in contact with them, fingers crossed for a solution! 
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:58:12
I would be calling to say my investment funds are currently being held hostage by your app :p  And I suppose so, I just glanced at the map briefly while dialing 45 digits at 3am local time.
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:34:14
I'm not sure what you mean by "on restore"
@_date: 2015-04-03 02:46:20
I guess until they figure out a fix I'll just sit here with one VERY expensive iPhone in one hand and my dick in the other. *gumpy gus*
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:27:48
that all makes sense to me.  I guess when I think about areas throughout central / south america - which have extreme poverty, but also sizeable wealth for some, I would just think there would be a larger atm presence. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:57:26
fair comment about the euro - the notion was lending more to areas that are at risk for hyperinflation.  Not asking about these areas using bitcoin as a primary store of value to protect their wealth - but as an option for sending/receiving money.    
As far as areas with stronger black market industries, there is probably the exact same risk factor for a bitcoin atm as any other fiat atm, and 2-way atm's limit the cash on hand and reduce risk.  I'm not suggesting downtown Mogadishu should be a great spot, but Panama City, Bogota, La Paz, Cape Town, Joberg, Kiev, etc etc etc
