Thanks. Never heard about Ceasar Cipher. Will research. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 09:22:48
Agreed re BIP39.. And actually by private key i meant the 24 word passphrase.. but "wife can only access in case of your death" part is the problem. So that would probably need to be a deposit box or a lawyer 
@_date: 2019-03-25 09:19:08
That sounds interesting. Any guidance how it can be done? Would you know if that's possible with a ledger nano wallet? Thanks
@_date: 2019-03-25 11:50:13
Can you also kindly clarify what do you exactly mean by "Include source code of the SSS page in the encrypted file" and "AES implementation used"?
@_date: 2019-03-25 10:08:47
Thanks! I dont want to trust either lawyers or wills that would expose the private key as you rightly stated. Also, complicating the things would be counter productive and actually increase the risk of my bitcoins being lost. So I would require a method which is if not "grandma proof" but at least "an average to high intelligence, professional, no prior bitcoin experience, no cryptography proof" 
@_date: 2019-03-25 12:30:14
Ah. clear now.. Thank you! 
@_date: 2019-03-25 09:26:42
Thanks! I considered timelock but as far as I know once it's time locked it becomes unspendable before the timelock date arrives. But that doesnt work in my case as I would like to be able to spend and trade at will.

She is a complete newbie, but I have instructed her that if i die, she would need to learn how to use Ledger Nano and how to do a bitcoin trade BEFORE trying to access the stash.

Yes, i joined reddit a week ago, but I was not born 1 week ago. I am invested in Bitcoin more than 99% of bitcoin holders. And I have been involved with Bitcoin way back than I started serious investment. So go "patronize" somebody else. 
PoW change is not only possible, but it is necessary. Without some governance, this scaling debate will go on for years, while other coins gain ground. If you like being slave to an egomaniacal chinese miner, then its your choice. I am waiting until November to see how the UASF drama plays out. But regardless, the pace of innovation required is way below what is achievable with the current PoW setup, or rather lack of any governance (And no..governance ≠ centralisation)
@_date: 2017-04-17 22:00:00
Oh that makes sense..thanks! 
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:40:51
I have been following bitcoin since the silkway times, and have traded occasionally. But I have made a significant investment (around USD 100k) in 2016 before halving. So yes I am growing impatient
@_date: 2017-04-18 10:42:40
1. Well there are over 16 mln bitcoins in circulation, 300k that Roger ver holds (i doubt it is still that much after his pump of alts, but still) is less than 2% of stake. But regardless, in current system stakeholders have very limited say and bitcoin itself is prone to manipulations by miners. What is the guarantee that Jihan wouldnt pull what he pulled with litecoin yesterday? i.e. start supporting Segwit, sell his stakes, stop supporting Segwit, buy stakes and repeat the first? It is akin to a Federal Reserve doing insider trading before rate announements. Something is obviously broken.
2. Well they certainly did manage to scare the hell out of the market and in the process hit the credibility of bitcoin. Plus they could have chosen to do a 51% attack (and it still is not out of question yet)
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:38:35
Change to something where the stakeholders/users have a say in the way forward. A good example would be Decred's governance system, a hybrid PoW/PoS (with lottery determination of the latter). I know that it is a "nuclear" option, but in my opinion it is the best option. Otherwise we will always depend on whims of centralised mining cartel based in China.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:14:17
My solution is following: 
1. Bought 2 ledger wallets
2. Made an absurd (but a full story) using all the random recovery words. 
3. Numerous times deleted and restored the same wallet (matter of fact I do it all the time, everytime being amazed that my wealth is stored in my brain)
4. Split the 24 word phrase in 2. First half is stored offline at home, second half online as a picture (though a person looking at it wouldnt understand what the hell it is)
5. Gave the pin code of my ledger wallets to my wife (2 copies of it) and instructed that in case I die she buys a ledger wallet and learns how to use it and only then retrieves the bitcoins from the original wallets (2 same ledger wallets)
@_date: 2017-04-18 10:44:04
Don't know. I don't condone specifically Decred's governance, but brought it up as an example ofalternative way of looking at things. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 09:10:42
1. I just stated a concrete and active governance system (Decred). PoS/PoW hybrid
2. I do not think it is "throwing Bitcoin away", but rather introduction of a decentralised governance system, as opposed to dictatorship by Chinese mining cartel. It is evolution in the right direction.

Well it would still be accessible to me. I am not talking about panic selling when btc is down 30-40%. I am immune to that, been in crypto for too long and have had my portfolio move in increments of high double digit percentages in both ways. I am planning to hodl relatively significant amount of around 100 btc. So I dont want to be able to sell in case for example bitcoin grows 5 times next year or falls down 5 times. I remember somebody mentioned a technical method couple of months ago (akin to time constrained technical spent lock), but cant seem to find. Also i want to still control my private key, but just not be able to spend anything from it until 2027.
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:10:00
Because something rising too fast will fall as fast. But most probably not the point where it started. I believe the long term support is at around $1800'ish level, but will take some time to get there. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:58:02
That is exactly what i want to do. Do u have any technical guidance on how to do that?

1. I am a participant in the market trading millions of dollars every month. 
2. As a participant of price making process I am sharing my opinion for people to make informed decisions. My mood now is bearish. It has been bullish all year long, and now it has turned bearish. 
3. If you want to hear only the "To the mooon! We are going to 100 k now! Hodl!" and stuff like that then you should just ignore the opposing opinions and continue your mental crypto rose garden walk. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:02:49

I am all for Bitcoin and its implications but I am calling the price a top or very near to top for the next couple of years. I think we are up for a long term consolidation to around USD 1850 level (probably couple of years) before going for another run, this time to at least $30k and beyond by around 2020-2022. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:48:09
Okay smart ass
1. I don't short Bitcoin as I stated earlier and this would be shorting
2. I don't do small bets 
3. I am sharing capture just from "kraken" for this months trading with my "grandmas" money so that you can STFU.. 
See the next post
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:28:59
1. Looks like a double top for crypto in general... a double top in trading means that the price (in this case the total market cap) will correct down.
2. The volumes have been gradually decreasing that means less trading, less radical price upswings meaning people not getting any returns start selling off
3. Pure trader's intuition. I have been trading these swings for a long time
I am not claiming that I am right, and have been proven wrong on many instances by bitcoin. Therefore I never short it. But let's see

1. Damn.. I am a good photoshopper in that case! cool stuff.. 
2. I am not sharing the photo of my balls you sick bastard :) 
3. I don't believe in ANYTHING.. I am just sharing my cold logical conclusion..  i would be very happy if I was wrong because I will be buying regardless of the price just not hold a big position.. 
4. I would bet easily as 1 btc as it is a pocket change bet just out of principle..but it is impossible to bet because it is unenforcable (and honestly i dont trust you have even 1 btc, or would seriouly put that money in a bet)...Also, I dont trust you to pay me 1 btc in case I am right, and you dont trust me to pay you 1 btc in case you are right.. I can go ahead and say that the bet is accepted but without any enforcing mechanism (that doesnt require sharing personal information) it would be meaningless..

To answer this question one needs to separate the "bitcoin believers" and "get rich quick" types. "Bitcoin believers" are the reason why bitcoin has any value, and "get rich quick" types are the reason why bitcoin has had this high rise in price in a short time. "Bitcoin believer" price is the base support price, and "get rich quick" price is the current one. In the beginning of the first wave (around Dec-Jan) the bitcoin "get rich quick" types entered the market at around USD 1000 which WAS the base price back then, and I believe this base price has grown to around USD 1800-1900. "Bitcoin believers" care about bitcoin, "get rich quick cryptomaniacs" believe in quick profits, and they don't care whether it is bitcoin or any other coin. So once this "get rich quick" guys start exiting the market (ALL CRYPTO) because of diminished returns or price pull backs, it will create a snowball effect leading the market up to the "believer" price which as I mentioned is around 1850-1900 by this time.

2. I don't understand your reasoning.. If you are in an extended bubble your 200 DMA is irrelevant as it will show you bubble DMA not anything else.. If you zoom out from 2011 onwards you will see what I am talking about

To the ones  who say "hodl", "do not trade" and bullshit like that.. The only reason Bitcoin has any value is because PEOPLE TRADE! I trade! And thanks goodness I do! Amd will continue to do so as long as I can.. Because of trading I was able to get 80% of my initial investment cashed out (just for the peace of mind) and kept 20% so that I avoid going full retard on the trades.. As a result of trading my initial stack of bitcoins has mutiplied several times! So stop HODLing and trade, because when you do, you are in control and make a statement. When you don't you are left to the pity of the ones who do and got to swallow the statements that they make. Happy trading! And in Satoshi we trust!

Dude.. if you really think that people all of a sudden magically will be selling all of their BTC'es so that you can buy them cheap.. well, you are up for a surprise.. :) this thing is just a correction.. the more price goes down, the more people will start buying.. and precisely for that reason it will not go down much further than 1400 (if it ever does).. So stop waiting for the "unicorn" price and just buy and hold. After the chain split FUD is over we are flying to at least 4k if not the whole 6k.. Because SEGWIT, baby!

Look man, stop fudding..you are not fooling anyone...Just because you lost money on XRP and other bullshit coins, doesnt mean that BTC is going down further.. You are fooling only YOURSELF. It is fairly difficult to price BTC but going with the long term price ranges is a good indicator..long term price range corridor for BTC now is USD 1400-2400. Implementing Segwit (Which is almost sure to happen) will form another upwards longterm trendline. So stop trying to price BTC, and above all stop telling people what to do just because you lost money

@_date: 2017-06-30 05:14:19
Well the issue is that that estimate is a very American centric. I am not an American, nor am I a western either, though live and work in the west. I dont have nearly as much as 5 millions usd worth of it, nor do I think that one needs that much to retire comfortably even in USA . Historical stock portfolio returns have been at around 7-8% minus 2-3% inflation adjustment, so leaving a net return of 5% after inflation. My estimate for a comfortable living would be around 70k usd per year (in USA), so in order to have that kind of return AND keep your wealth intact until one dies one needs "only" around USD 1.4 mln (70K/0.05). And if you dont plan on leaving inheritance then that sum becomes even less. Add to that retiring at a lower costing country, that sum becomes even less.
P.S. College is free in most of the countries actually, save USA. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:02:15
Well that is the issue.. what I could do is actually retire if I chose to.. Or practically speaking could go to college and get another degree in something that interests me, travel the world etc etc. So for me now the choice is between comfortable freedom now, versus POSSIBLE considerable wealth later.. Which I understand is a very luxury problem to have, but makes it extremely difficult to HODL as the downside would be losing the opportunity for freedom.. But the emotional attachment I have to bitcoin is strong (and probably irrational), therefore I am stuck in between cashing out now, and hodling for possible future.. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:26:00
That is a wise strategy and a compromise (kind of keeping your cake, and eating it a little bit at the same time). But after some time the relative size becomes an issue, i never expected it to grow this big, and this fast..i was always expecting a small but consistent growth, with some corrections along the way..but well, the crypto bubble did its job... and now I am sitting on bitcoins worth 8 years of my well paying full time job..
