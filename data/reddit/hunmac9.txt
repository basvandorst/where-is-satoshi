For the money....I mean, the technology
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:34:03
Progress? That's so unhelpful 
Blockchain could help industries, yes. Butcoin-not so much.

Yes, please do. It'll be a lot more pleasant

Well, I'm not really denying that it's hard to ban, just not harder than cars, but I'll answer your question anyways. 
For one, you can't completely ban it. There will always be some means of getting through regulations, as has been proven hundreds of times with various crimes. But taking a few simple steps will wipe out the majority of bitcoins usage (this I'd only if they want to wipe out it's usage. If it actually happens, they probably won't go through many steps besides shutting down exchanges)
1. Issuing a general ban on all blockchain based currencies.
2. Forcefully shutdown all exchanges who do not comply. This is not very hard if they are doing something illegal. 
3. Ban the mining of all blockchain based currencies, making ASIC machines and any other specially made hardware for mining. May include forcing companies like Nvidia and AMD to implement anti-mining strategies. 
4. Put heavy charges on anyone caught using bitcoin.

It's volatile. Makes it completely unsuitable as a currency, and I absolutely understand why companies aren't supporting it.

Username does not check out, but this is absolutely true, it's kind of infuriating that people will believe whatever is shoved up their ass. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:30:44
No, I'm not. 
Talking? Lol
So you're saying there's not a mechanism for stopping people from doing an action online (which is exactly what it is), but there is for stopping over a billion people from doing something that may cost them their jobs, lives, houses, kids, even their lives in some cases (getting treatment for an injury or something), etc.
There are so many things banned online that have been heavily enforced, yet I can't think of one thing that has been enforced to stop people from doing all of what I listed above. You think that the government, which can't even completely stop something like the illegal drug trade, can stop something that has hundreds of thousands more times users? 
You're an idiot...

Feasibility is also astronomically low for cars. 
Immediate bans of cars would cause a revolution. Seriously. I don't even know where to start an argument about how impossible it would be, because of so many reasons. 
Sure, a gradual change over the next 17 years with a reasonable replacement (EVs, which are still cars, by the way), it's easy enough. But it's ridiculous saying that banning cars would be easier then a fucking internet coin that has very little going for it...Billions of people's lives do not hinge on Bitcoin, or are even remotely affected by it. 
Stop talking up your ass.

It's the same amount of work for substantially less reward.

He answered the question...and then went on to brag about how great he is and how much he's made. I'm happy for him, maybe even jealous, but he's obviously just posting to up his ego, which is just cringey. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:24:37
Good answer. 
If everyone in Bitcoin thought like you'd, I'd probably have no problems with it whatsoever. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:30:13
I'll mow your lawn for 5BC 
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:06:35
E. Everything else is completely and utterly useless. 
Don't try to bs your way into saying that bitcoin will last forever and grow exponentially: it won't. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:15:22
*Chart fluctuates thousands of dollars in days*
Pretty much no proof it works. Just no evidence to prove it doesn't right now. 


See point one. 


*very very very slowly making very little progress. While a huge amount of altcoins have vastly better systems*
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:11:02
Common thread here: everything has changed from whatever variation the comment is made on. For example, if computers stayed $5000 bricks, they would have failed. 
They all had major innovations. Bitcoin boomed because it *was* a major innovation. Right now it seems to be one of the worst Cryptos, and since it is the leader it puts a bad name on them all. 
You guys need innovation to keep you alive. Currently it's slow/no progress. 
Also, what retarded post. Millions of things that have been bashed *have* failed. And you're pointing out the few that succeeded? 
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:51:03
It's people like you that make me doubt how Bitcoin will ever get traction. Just blindly following whatever they read. 
As of 2010, over 1 billion people owned and operated cars. 
There are maybe 15~ million people with Bitcoin. 
Banning something that would literally cause our society to fall (not an understatement, think about it) vs a currency that sort of has a influence in a few people. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:05:01
OP is doing that. Not me. I was directly addressing exactly what you said that you believed Bitcoin is doing. 
And yes, no proof that it works/will continue working/is safe/etc 
People like you are why bitcoin could fail. Because (most of) it's supporters are idiots who believe whatever is spoon-fed to them. *Bitcoin is doing great? Yay! Bitcoin is working hard  on segwit adoption? Yay! Bitcoin is an insanely high risk investment? No it isn't, GTFO! Bitcoin is ten years behind altcoins? No it isn't, "do your research".*
There's reason it isn't being adopted very well. Downvote me if you want. It doesn't really help your argument. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:15:38
Equally true. 
Pretty much anything on this list could probably get you killed in the future, too. What if plastic is completely outlawed? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:18:38
Fall behind? In what? 
It's a great thought and all but it's really quite ignorant 
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:45:04
Yup, disappointed it isn't here yet
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:33:07
Fianlly someone who's legitimately reasonable in all these crypto subs. 
It starts to get tedious when people just start preaching about how great it is and not considering the real problems. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:31:16
Repost.exe and it wasn't funny the first time 
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:40:36
No, this is even better. It's a "everybody else is just buying into the re-education of the big ol corporations coming to hunt you down." 
Basically an "I'm special and everybody else is an idiot." argument..
