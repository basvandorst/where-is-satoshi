Yeah it's a long story but to sum it up I got in by finding the head of the bank figuring out where he will be on the week ends via facebook then I accidentally ran into him and asked him if he was ( that person ) when he replied yes I said I was doing a school project and I asked him if I can go to the work place to interview him he agreed and when I did go to him I jokingly said to him that I would love to work in this bank.to do finance and after 2 weeks if training I told him I want a job here and he agreed. I made him think I'm smarter than I am and he truly thinks I'm some sort of prodigy or genius. You can tell I'm really not because of my grammatical mistakes and spelling lol.

Thank you for replying, the whole point of me doing this isn't to make significant money 
I'm just going to see if I can generate any money at all, while I am on vacation I'll be looking into buying asic equipment, but if you may one more question. I use jaxx as a walet if I connect that to my mining program will the money generated be live ? E.g If I earn 10 cents in 3 hours will I be able to see my wallet update?
