I rode the rollercoaster up and down and up and down during the spike two years ago and got off the ride. Regretting that now, but what a ride! Have fun!

You are not understanding the concept in its fullness. There is a difference between transparent and private. Transparent is a quality of decentralization and centralization (sometimes). Transactions should be transparent. But privacy in terms of who is making the transactions is crucial to decentralization. If an institution, corporation, government etc can decipher WHO is doing the transactions, it is not decentralized ledger. It is just a database.

Not true. There is a difference between transparent and private. Transparent is a quality of both centralization and decentralization. Transactions should be transparent to all. But privacy in terms of WHO is making the transactions is crucial to decentralization. If an institution, corporation, government etc can decipher WHO is doing the transactions, it is not decentralized ledger. It is just a database. Anyone can track transactions, central or decentral. No one should be able to track specific people making the transactions, eliminating privacy.

No, monero is excellent in that regard, perhaps even the most excellent. Re-read my post and you will see me say that.

I agree completely about your choice of crypto, but that is not the point in my personal opinion. Blockchain is a means to establish decentralization. In order to have true decentralized communication in the form of transactions, they must be highly protected and private to the level of satisfaction of its users. If blockchain can be deciphered it is not decentralized in the truest sense, which is why this is something we should all be “worried” about.
