that does not seem to be in any plans as far as i've seen. 
i'm sure somebody will come along and make some kind of combo bitcoin/ln enabled wallet that does all the right things and makes it easy. but i also think core is going to want to stay core, and as a "layer 1" protocol, it can never truly acknowledge that a "layer 2" exists. that's just how you build these things. protocols can look down but not up. http uses tcp but tcp just shuttles those packets knowing nothing about its payloads

i think we'll arrive at lower volatility but it will take a long time, decades
right now we're trying to discover the price of a new kind of asset, never before seen in history, and barely considered. the value started from 0 and we don't know what it should be, all we know is it's somewhere between 0 and infinity, but probably not close to either of those

this is like looking at a model T and declaring that the car will never replace a reliable horse.
mostly the answers to all those problems are some kind of multisig schemes or advanced scripting solutions. complex stuff that will come in time, but we're still grinding out the basics. 
listen to rusty russell describe a feature they call 'covenants' [in this recent bitcoin talk]( he describes how you can set up something called a 'vault' where there's a time lock on any outputs and an emergency key you can use to override it. this seems like it'd help defend against all kinds of theft.
for the other problems, anybody with a significant amount of wealth is going to want to consider those problems, and, in the future, if they have a lot of wealth in this asset class, they'll do the same thing they would do now for any other asset class: find a professional to help you and probably do most of the hard work.
so you're not wrong, these are important problems, and if you watch the rest of rusty's talk you'll see that they're thinking about these and a whole lot more. so i think it's very premature to declare this a failed experiment

already done. you can't fractionally reserve bitcoin, so you can't do loans. instead, bitcoin deflates and by saving you increase your buying power in the future. in other words, by not spending your money you *de facto* are extending a loan to all other holders of bitcoin. you get paid back in the deflationary interest rate.

it does. [this BTC "dominance" chart]( has bitcoin down to 33% and eth ~20%, between the two of them that's a little over half the field. 
25% of the chart is simply listed as "others", up from 5% around april 2017 to 10% and another jump from 10% to 25% in early december.
great observation you've made, thanks, i was looking at this chart earlier and didn't even notice that
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:50:57
well, first of all, i'd point out that the dollar is NOT backed by gold and it hasn't been since 1971. i'd go on to point out that, in fact, this is the problem that bitcoin sets out to solve. 
by taking the US Dollar off the gold standard, it became possible for committees of persons to decide to print more and more currency. with a consensus-derived monetary policy, like bitcoin, where inflation of the money supply happens predictably and cannot be manipulated we actual have a better standard than the standard that gold was trying to be in the first place.
and finish with the observation that gold, like dollars and bitcoin, are only worth what somebody will pay you for them at that moment.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:43:41
well the way it is right now, if your coin is locked in a channel, you can't sell it on an exchange.  ergo, price goes up. but remember there's not yet even 4 whole BTC in the network yet.
if exchanges start accepting LN coins directly, that changes that calculus though, we're back to where we are now i suppose (just metcalfe's law etc).
as long as a barrier continues to exist between the on-LN coins and the coins you can trade for fiat there will be this downward pressure on supply. but it probably won't exist for long, and/or arbers will show up and find a way to exploit (and neutralize) this difference

i wondering if this is a scheme that RH is in on for some whales to paint the tape in advance of the next (or some future) futures contract closing
they have said they will allow crypto withdrawals but not deposits, and you can obviously do fiat withdrawals and deposits. so that means that any arbitrage opportunity using RH will require crypto to exit their platform, raising the prices. since its no fees, somebody can just be washing trades and pushing the price whichever way they want, while arb'ing is broken and biasing the prices in one direction
Real stock markets have fees because it's illegal not to, for just this reason, because regulators don't want people to artificially inflate volume in order to control the price on the ticker, aka "painting the tape"

linking electrical generation to the basic token of economic value (essentially by setting a minimum value on a unit of power, relative to everything else) seems like an incredibly elegant way to structure the economy
there's a guaranteed buyer for power now, and they're paying something like 12.5BTC for however many watts it takes to mine a block
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:16:49
no you'll still only have 1 BTC, but your purchasing power will increase since prices will come down. it's deflation, reverse inflation. that thing that costs 2 BTC (for example something that costs $20,000, might cost $18,750 next year)
practically speaking, this means you'll probably still be buying things in dollars (or priced in dollars), or some other local fiat, but the exchange rates will continually be increasing. the market is very volatile right now, but with enough market penetration we could arrive at a state where it can be relied on to deflate at a consistent, predictable rate.

@_date: 2017-12-27 14:38:16
technology and engineering are all about balancing tradeoffs, about compromising to find the best balance between wanted features and undesired side effects.
i don't have to "pay" to "pre-fund" a credit card, but on the other hand, that's because visa is perfectly happy to make it seem easy to extend me a loan, in the hopes i'll forget to pay them back right away and end up paying more in fees.
we'd all prefer perfect on-chain scalability and autonomy, but there's no way to do that, so here we are discussing the best place to put a "seam" in the system so we get more of what we want and less of what we don't. slowly, slowly, the world turns and maybe the next day is a little better than the day before.

analogies are by definition flawed, if you wanted to describe the concept you'd just describe the concept and not use another concept to stand-in for it to help describe it.
but the cash in my wallet IS locked there. the only way out is via the "cash system" (or in this analogy, the lightning network). if i want to "convert" it back to "bank money" (not cash/not lightning) i have to go to *my* bank and deposit it, which i can do at any time (well, from 9am-5pm M-F and not on holidays). the deposit is free, but i don't get the ATM fees back that i spent to withdraw it to begin with.
in fact, i don't believe i can deposit cash at an ATM, I have to visit a teller where I live. i've never had to do this though, usually i end up spending all the cash i end up withdrawing. which i suspect is what will happen with all the lightning channels i open too.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:33:33
i do usually have to pay like $2.50 though. sometimes as much as $4

we don't even know what a flaw would look like if they hacked it. we know of some possible attack vectors, like a 51% attack, and a lot of thought has been put into mitigating it, and other known attacks too. 
of course, nobody knows what we don't see. and in 8 years it hasn't happened, but it's grown to $250b in value. that's a big pot for someone to figure out how to break. maybe whoever can break it needs a pot bigger than that to make it worthwhile. we'll have to keep testing, essentially the existence and "non-broken" state is a another test, a little more proof each day that it *probably* can't be broken at this level of value.
(edit, add:) if it can't be broken at this level, it's less likely that it could have been broken at a previous level, and it's almost certain that it's not worth breaking it at any level prior to that. so as the value increases, and it remains unbroken, it proves that's it not breakable for the value you could obtain by breaking it. the higher the value, and the longer it goes, the stronger the little bits of proof become. how big does the pot need to be until we just say, "yea, at any level of value, for all practical purposes, this is not going to break?"
so it's not that it will never happen, but it slowly, incrementally, becomes increasingly unlikely. it never becomes impossible (0% likelihood), but it's the direction it's trending.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:15:30

the decentralization isn't about fees, it's that at 1MB it remains feasible to run a mining node on hardware and bandwidth that just about anybody can access, and is available pretty much globally
it doesn't mean mining *is* decentralized, but it *could be*. if you increase the blocksize and remove this "feature" then it almost certainly *couldn't* be decentralized
the fee market is a side effect that is not being optimized for in this scenario, hence 2nd-layer solutions to solve that wrinkle without affecting the mining decentralization goals
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:53:53
you really do, i've already been through it twice now. still not enough to really grok it all. there's several layers of depth at play. i don't think you need to see Michael Crichton's 1973 original version though, as that was far less interesting (and entertaining). The sequel Futureworld wrestled with some different concepts, and is pretty interesting though. I'm absolutely certain Westworld's second season will do it justice, however
i don't want to get into spoilers for you, but I now see that they are definitely addressing Jaynes' concepts directly, if the naming of their (epic) finale didn't already demonstrate that

i think the forest you may be missing is fractional reserve banking. currency isn't just about transacting, it's also about price discovery and value comparison between commodities. 
fractional reserve banking, or the ability for a political institution to influence the value of any currency they control, is the central tenant that the genesis block message was addressing. the bailouts were specifically the problem that satoshi was considering when he imbued this blockchain with that concept. more centrally (no pun intended) are the ancient abilities of governments to passively tax their citizens using rates of inflation.
the bailouts were a way for government(s) to alter the sea levels of the economy in order to enrich those few who had lost funds at the expense of the many who had been saving. nobody cares about buying cups of coffee with bitcoin, but what bitcoin does care about (since it contains in its genesis block the phrase "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks") is the consistent value of that currency. In other words, that that cup of coffee remains the same price from day to day, and that in relation to say, the price of grain, or a liter of water, it remains relatively consistent. 
You might argue that Bitcoin cannot fulfill this mission, due to the volatility of it's price, but we're looking at a revolutionary class of asset that is growing from the value of $0. Anything that grows from the value of 0 is necessarily going to grow at an infinite rate. The value in relation to our legacy fiat currencies will eventually flatten out, and furthermore, these fiat currencies will continue to inflate while Bitcoin continues to deflate. The volatility is not inherent in the system, it's simply a symptom any system would have in its early stages of growth.

6.25BTC * 10 blocks/hr * 24hrs/day = 900BTC paid in miner rewards per day, that's almost $6m/day before you factor in fees.
so of that 0.025% that we pay out/day some significant portion of it must be going to pay miner's expenses, like electricity and chip depreciation.
we know that they're not typically spending more than $6m/day (or %0.025% of market cap) on average because if they were, they'd go out of business and stop mining and the hashrate would would fall until they were profitable. and they're probably spending slightly less than that, the in-between is profit. and the profit margin most likely trends to 0

if one of the nodes on the hops doesn't fulfill and pass along the contract, the payment will fail. again, it's as if it never happened, nobody claimed to have decrypted the necessary information in the alloted time allowed
@_date: 2018-08-05 15:04:51
there is no concept of "lost". a payment is a contract inside a contract inside a contract, etc, each hop on the network has the crytographic capability to peel off exactly one of these contracts and route the rest to the node indicated, retaining the fee. your recipient needs to collect all of the unwrapped contracts to fulfill the AMP contract, once they have all the pieces, the money is theirs, no sooner. and if the payment fails, you lose nothing, you effectively never sent it.
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:41:56
this new outfit, bakkt, i think aims to undercut visa and mc, who have since time immemorial had a hard floor on fees of about 2% per transaction value. it shouldn't be too hard to undercut them by a significant amount, especially if they are offering transaction rates that aren't tied to transaction value (or have a high value for the cutoff there, like ~$500)
it's got to be the reason starbucks is on-board, think of how many transactions they make on a daily basis, if they can get that down to a flat fee per-transaction there's a lot of money they can save
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:16:04
that's definitely the problem. it's granularity of it. i don't know what newspapers i'm going to read in a month, but if I land on the page and it's paywalled, I have a choice of either paying $10 with the hopes I use that value or finding a way around the paywall, like asking in the reddit post for someone to post it. There's lots of leaking that can happen here
But lightning network presents a new option, because I can add $10 to my browser's lightning wallet plugin and instead of finding paywalls as I click around, they'll present themselves invisibly to me, and when they request $0.000539 per page view, it's below the "automatically pay" threshold I set and they get paid. 
Now I spend a lot more money online, because I don't have to think about it each time, and can broadly say, "here's a budget of $X to access paid content online without me having to think about it". Content providers get paid, consumers have control, and they can passively be paying small amounts frequently.
the problem right now is that there's never been a way to collect payments of less than about $5 economically. think of all the content that can be sold for for under $5, when you can legitimately have transactions taking place for millionths of a cent.
so it's not the price that's prohibitive, it's the friction.

the next level is people buying goods priced in fiat, the seller receiving funds of fiat, and the transaction taking place invisibly to them over a crypto network, like bitcoin itself, lightning or something else
from a user's point of view, it's a different kind of payment card (probably a prepaid debit card), just like any of visa's, and from a seller's it's the same thing but they get cheaper rates or different rate schedules than what visa offers.
it's centralized, sure, but it's another use case
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:32:19

@_date: 2014-02-10 16:45:04
look at it as 4 tables of 2 columns each.  
on the left you have the the buy/sell orders currently on the book, and on the right you have the same but a broader view, because it aggregates all orders up to a price.  the top are sell orders, the bottom are buys.  the big number in the middle is the price of the last trade.   (the box with timestamps below these order tables is the trade history, the top item will always match the value of the "big" number)
so, to use your screencap as an example, it's showing on the "top" of each book: a seller (it could be multiple sellers) asking $704.80 for 0.4160btc, and you have a buyer (or number of buyers) bidding $704.00 for 10.548btc
so anybody that places a sell for $704.00 or less while that buy is on the book will execute at $704.00, until those 10btc are depleted.  likewise for any buy at or over $704.80, it will be executed at $704.80 until that half btc is depleted.  of course, orders can be cancelled at any time, so the amount of btc for the order may not all be bought or sold, it might just be taken down from offer
the tables on the right tell you that there are 167btc in buys at 700 and over.  320btc at 695 and up (including that first 167, mind you), and so on. there's a very small amount for sale at 705 or below, and 38btc for sale at 710 and under, etc, etc
notice also that the green and red lines to the right of the chart (and left of these tables) are an illustration of the order book, showing you visually how the orders are currently distributed.  you can see a small ridge at maybe $713 and another at $715, these show where some (small) "walls" are in the 38btc to 229btc jump between $710 and $715.
*edit: misread a number*

That's a failure of the coder to properly engineer the machine.  Both parties sue them, and maybe their malpractice insurance takes care of it.
But this isn't going to happen because they can model and test the contract before making it active, something you can't do using a civil justice system.  Anything of significant worth i'm sure would be audited by a third party for verification.  Any programmer worth their salt would also be providing proof of functionality as well.

People have always been musing about the robot takeover, but I've always been of a mind that humans (and, generally speaking, any meat-based consciousness) has something of value that a robot (or AI, or digitally based consciousness) can never have:
**the ability to make mistakes.**
making frequent mistakes is and always has been one of humanity's greatest assets.  it's reliable, it's consistent, and there's an endless source of energy to provide them.  in this line of thought is also another crucial aspect of our humanity, **the tendency to do things for no logical reason**, or even for illogical or anti-logical reasons.
so much of our culture and history is based around people taking risks and winning, or doing something by accident and having it turn out better than it ever could have had it been anticipated.  more often mistakes can lead to bad things, of course even catastrophic things.  but those few times when a mistake turns out to be beneficial the net gain is off the charts.
And so we will coexist, the perfect and the imperfect, relying on each others strengths and deferring to each other in our weaknesses.  Robots will complement us, they are us, created in our image.
TL;DR, humans will always have a place by the side of robots as an excellent source of entropy

well i didn't say it wasn't going to be difficult, contract law is hard too.  and like contract law, established templates, probably even open sourced contracts, will come into existence. and nasa never had *that* many eyeballs.
but those were big software projects, huge, some of the biggest ever.  is a contract going to rival that?  no way, not ever.  we're talking like on the scale of shell scripts, max, and usually they'll be just a couple of one-liners, realistically speaking. 
you can formally verify that, it may still be difficult, but it's not rocket science
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:57:16


no way, the value in the network lies in the fact that is of *peers*, you can't exclude *anybody* without heading down the slippery slope
it's been taken into account by diff adjustment and the ability to distribute mining.  ie, it will help to make it more expensive for them to 50% or 99% attack it or whatever, as well as increasing the risk.  i suppose the security is based on the assumption that there's now way they could "quietly" just outperform the network, they'd have to build some massive infrastructure to do so (much more expensive and risky), or do so slowly, which would allow for the network to adapt (and so is still expensive, since you run your massive mining cluster for longer and still risky)

well yes, if pure randomness is what you're looking for, we're not good sources of that.  humans that may be provably good sources of entropy, in a technical sense, we'd probably only find in mental hospitals.  that's *too* random
no, more typically we're not good sources of entropy in that way, but maybe a better way to say it is that even our entropy output tends to be erratic.  we produce "normal" for long stretches before "random" pops up (in the form of a "mistake", as i'm sketching the this theory)
I guess I'm trying to say that we're not the entropy source robots want to use for encrypting their communications, we're a different kind of source, with certain properties that can't be found anywhere else
I suppose if a robot could explain it, they'd call us their muse.  Their creative inspiration.

I'm a developer, but I have trouble visualizing what a a solution that meets your requirements would actually look like.
I've not used p2pool, but the wiki page was clear to me, and i understand how the system is operating.  i don't mean to blame forrestv, though this sounds like it, but due to his (actually very clever) modularization of the p2pool code, there have to be 3 different "actors" on the stage at any one time.  herein lies the source of complexity.
you have the wallet software, the miner software, and the p2pool client.  basically the miner just mines normally, and the wallet acts as a blockchain server (just a big database, really), while the p2pool code runs in a loop, studying the blockchain, receiving information from the pool network, and feeding it to the miner and feeding its outputs back to the pool network.
see how none of that actually relies on specifically being bitcoin itself.  any wallet and miner combo you can drop in and run the p2pool client against them and be pool mining whatever coin.  genius.  and updates to mining software or the wallets (important stuff, that shouldn't affect pool mining, ever), those can happen, no problem.  just don't mess with the external APIs (wallet rpc and mining protocols), which nobody is going to do anyway.
so it's very good, the "3-part" system is very agile, and maintenance is much simpler (reducing bugs!).  great, wonderful, except, as you point out, for new users. 
so i ask again, what about this system could change to actually meet the requirements?  i ask because requirements are an important part to a solution, but i have not seen any solutions here
now that i've got my juices flowing, maybe i can try a stab at this.  perhaps to take a page from the windows security center (i can't believe i just said that), imagine a UI, we'll call the p2pool GUI, and it'd basically just display to you 3 big status icons for each "subsystem", one for wallet, one for miner and one for pool client.  of course they can be red X's (software not running), yellow triangles (software running, but not connected or ready), and everybody's favorite, green checkmarks (software running and working)
with all 3 checkmarks, you are mining.  it would be quite nice to show some mining stats here now (ala, relaying what is provided by p2pool's "Web interface" as described on [the wiki](
the 3 subsystems shown can offer you options to start each one (which as an option the tool will do upon startup, and the tool can be started at system boot by option too), and maybe (ahem, in v2) provide ui for setting the relevant configs in those.  (the wallet rpc config stuff is simple, but a gui for setting the mining parameters, yea, no, not at first, somebody must have made some of those, like GUIminer, but i've always just used config files though, i'm sure there's code that could be "borrowed" for this though)
i'm mostly a backend and web developer, however, and what i've just described sounds more like it should be a QT application (or some other cross-platform desktop app), something i don't have experience developing.
do you think this is heading in the right direction?

i hear you and i like your succinct description.  
i suppose i was trying to describe why it's difficult to do that, and it's because the p2pool code we're making the gui for is designed to not care what miner or wallet you use, and furthermore, guified miners aren't all that common besides, which is something that would actually be built right in to the tool you describe, not just sort of "outsourced" to cg/bfgminer whathaveyou
the p2pool client has to do all the blockchain validation, unlike "centralized pools" that do that for you, i think it's important to underline just how crucial this operation is.  this *can not* fail or produce incorrect outputs.  very bad, unpredictable consequences can come from that.  so thats why we use the wallet and its rpc api instead of shipping that part with the p2pool gui tool.  
i guess i'm just trying to make clear just what kind of tall order a p2pool gui is, and the reason it doesn't exist yet.
if you're going to operate a miner like this, you're going to have to care it's in 3-parts, that's how it works, and if there's a problem with one of the parts the tool is going to need "language" to inform you about it.  it sounds like the above is more of a "check engine light" approach, that just says, "take it to a pro to find out what's wrong", i'm thinking it's better to inform the user about what's under the hood a little, if it's all working, they don't have to care, but it's when things break you want to know where.  even you, i'm sure of it.
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:35:05
i think the key you're looking for is the core "theory" of the p2pool code, basically think of the p2pool as another coin that you can merge mine bitcoin with, just like namecoin.  the p2poolcoin blockchain contains information about each miner's payout address and the shares they provided, when somebody finds a block that has a difficulty high enough to go on the btc blockchain then it pays out to all of those addresses.  
at this point, we know *how* they pay out, but i had to read a bit more to find out the answer to your question of *how do they enforce the payout*
and i finally found it, which is basically that the p2pool blocks you're hashing for include valid transactions to payout to all the previous contributing miners in proportion.  and if you are producing blocks that *don't* have these payout transactions in them they're not going to be accepted by the p2pool chain and you're a jerk.
to put it more simply, the blocks generated by the p2pool *contain payouts to all miners*, and if it can go on the bitcoin blockchain it'll go on there with *payouts to all the miners* for the reward in the found block
[here's an example of a p2pool found block]( you can see that the 25 and change block reward goes out to about a thousand people.  a chummy community of peers in a pool. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:05:58
who is "they", there is no "they", there is only "us"
if somebody messed with the payouts in some way they wouldn't get into the pool's "share chain" because their blocks would be rejected by all the other honest miners.  they could spend all their time just hashing nefarious blocks that steal from the p2pool, but they won't get any shares the entire time they do that (they all get rejected), and if they finally find one, they'll just get the pools reward instead of the pool, but at that point they'd probably have better results just mining solo.

Lawyers have to be involved because the way a contract is evaluated is you get a judge and go through the whole courtroom thing.  Lawyers study how that process works, that's their job, so they guide you through.
If it's a bitcoin contract, it follows the set out specification rules, and outcomes can all be accurately predicted beforehand for all possible events.  You don't hire a lawyer to create this contract, you hire a programmer.
A failure to obey a contract requires a suit to rectify.  A bitcoin contract cannot fail to be obeyed, it's a machine, it's gonna happen.  Maybe now you'll have to sue the programmer for providing faulty code, but that's another matter.
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:40:32
yea using the same word, a contract, here is leading to a lot of the confusion.  they are very different things.  You probably will never have  a "large contract" like you do in the traditional model.  Most likely it will be a system of smaller contracts acting as a whole.
you seem like an executive type, not an engineer.  i think you're trying to view them as both being in "soft" systems but they're not, they behave differently and are made of entirely different substance
if you really want to wrap your head around what i'm trying to say, take a look at the [ethereum protocol specification]( which goes into all kinds of gory detail about what you could do with a software-based contract system that you can't do with our traditional legal system.
ethereum may not take off, and the system we're discussing (i'm not even sure how we got here now) may be nothing like it, but they're talking about how to solve the same problems, and that paper is probably going to make much clearer arguments than i can
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:05:14
the big difference is that nobody can create money out of thin air ever, which has something to do with how loans work but i'm not going to try to explain anything in this area for a little while
see [parxulus correcting me below](
~~the big difference is that you can't do fractional reserve banking (FRB) with cryptocurrencies.~~
~~FRB basically means that say you have $1000 in your savings account the bank can legally provide something like $10,000 in loans, thus actually creating more money in the system.  They can do it because the money doesn't need to actually be cash ever, it's just the debts that they add up, eventually they get paid, and they do have that money, but by then they've loaned out even more, you see how it works.~~
~~You can't loan invisible money like that with crypto, you just can't.  Nobody can spend coin the blockchain doesn't really have on it.  So nobody can set up a bank and loan out more than have on deposit because it simply isn't possible.~~
~~That doesn't mean you can't have banks and loans, they just have to stay flat and adjusted equally with deposits, not scaled against them.~~

@_date: 2014-01-21 22:26:19
well, yes, on the surface that's the case.  However, if you look at it with a rational mind and not hyperbole you see that the lawyers work within a "soft" system, operated by people, frequently inconsistent, and overall, when viewed as a closed system, difficult to accurately predict outputs based on inputs
but the programmers work in a world of math and of machines.  the contract *can't* be violated.  it's terms will *never* be ambiguous, nor will there be even the slightest uncertainty about their effects *ever*.  it is iron, because that's how words in this world work, unlike words in the language of law, which is itself a subset of english and even referred to as "code".  
these words *are* the machine.  these contracts are written using a more sophisticated language than the language that traditional contracts are written in, it's more accurate, it's more predictable, and it's impossible not to obey the language.
So, overall, i'd say it's an improvement, by quite a bit, yes, just because DIY is still difficult doesn't mean it's a poor trade-off.  i think it's a big improvement in this area as well, though.  
i'm pretty sure there's a lot more people that can read a white paper and understand a protocol specification than there are that can understand and be knowledgeable about the nuances of contract law and court precedents. so because of this, these "contract coders" will almost certainly be less expensive than any lawyer.

i am a programmer, i know what tests are.  and they are proofs, they are proofs for very specific things, that's correct, but if you test everything (and there are ways to prove you did) then you are proving everything.
and we're not talking about "most software" here, the level of correctness required for the code for Angry Birds is quite different than that required for the code operating an MRI scanner or rocket launch.  and the amount of effort that goes into proving correctness with complete test coverage is adjusted accordingly.
ie, Rovio has tests, sure, but NASA has more
it's easier to test smaller bits of software too, and a contract will always be a pretty small piece of software.  so being small and of high worth, you're going to have complete test coverage and *know* behavior for *all* inputs and outputs.  i don't see how there would be anything left to "prove"
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:11:35
proofs of software are rare?  they're usually in a folder called t/ and they're called "test suites" or "unit tests"
good software has them, and good programmers use them as development tools
if you're coding a contract and your job is to ensure it has to be correct, you're going to have tests that prove it.
take, say, airplane landing software for an example.  that can not be wrong, and they have many, many tests proving it won't be.

let's look at the arguments made in this masterfully crafted article
1) Finite supply


what?  supply is to be increasing for at least the next 100 years, and after that fees for using the system will continue to be reallocated to miners, achieving the same effect as a virtual, constantly increasing supply
2) no automatic supply altering reactions


*growcoin*?  what is wrong with this guy?  it's called the difficulty adjustment, that's exactly what it's for.  bad news is going to make people turn off their miners, the ones that hang in there get a bigger slice of the smaller pie.  when times turn around miners come back.
perhaps the reaction (diff adjustment) occurring roughly every 14 days is a bit slow, but how long does it take the fed to act on bad news? 
3) no where to go to prevent a bank run
banks can run their own miners and all they need to do is have a rate limit on your account and they can be sure they'll mine enough to cover you given some predictable and reasonable amount of time

starting at 
the most efficient miner requires 0.27W/GH/s, and is a 1600W device, yielding (1600w/.27w/ghs) slightly less than 6THs per device.
[today's network hashrate]( was 297,274,672.05, or about 300THs, so if we magically replaced all existing hardware with one of these we'd need (297274672.05/6000, or 300/6) about 50k of them
the specs page says these are 2U racks, [one rack unit]( is 1.75" high, and we're stopping at 4 of them so you'll need a 7" high warehouse with a lot of acerage it sounds like.  let's not do that, and instead figure we're going to use standard 42U racks and be able to cram them all full of 21 miners each.
so that might be something in the neighborhood of (50k/21) 2,400 racks,


assuming the most compact rack at 600mm or 23.622" per side, round that up to 2ft per side, and pack them all in with that more generous average footprint of 4sqft.  2400 racks would need (2400*4) nearly 10k sqft, which is only (~0.23) about a quarter acre.
but, now that i've done that, back to the original 4-high racks that would hold only 4 miners each so you'd now need 12.5k racks, or a tidy 50k sqft, or (1.148) a little over a full acre
so, as an interesting corollary to your question we can say that a requirement of 4-high racks basically yields an equivalent of about 1 miner per sqft

reproducible builds is pretty much what i came into this thread to bring up, but i didn't know it by that name.  it's definitely what you need here.  i think it is possible to allow the user to select from a list or provide an existing iso on their machine (ubuntu, debian, knoppix whatever) and the script would mount the iso, perform the necessary alterations to add bitcoin software to the image, and produce a modified iso.  i know the tools exist to manipulate images, but it's a complicated thing i know.
[UNetbootin]( is a good example of an end goal.  you pick a distro, it downloads it.  in yours, user can provide it themselves if they want, same for all the bitcoin packages we're talking about.  go as far as to download a fresh blockchain and stick that in the image, even update images with fresher blockchains too.
but even if they don't provide the software, it's downloaded from trusted sources (github official repos), not distributed in the download

 is your friend, friend
today they estimated bitcoin cleared around $50m, i don't know how to estimate daily global transaction volume either, but the [forex market]( clears an estimated $4000m a day, or just maybe 80x today's activity.  seems a good market to compare against.
the problem with this line of thought, fun though it is, is that the real issue here is the power consumption.  at 1600W each for 50k miners you'll need maybe a dozen medium size nuclear power plants or 3-4 three gorges dams
if we assume moore's law plays by its rules, in 2 years we'll only need 25k miners at 1600W, and 12.5k in 4 years.  in 30 years we'd need only 1500 miners and about one large nuclear power plant to provide the roughly 2400MW we'll need, for today's hashrate, sufficient for $50m in transactions
the other side of this (sigh, ..coin) is the btc/usd conversion rate, because if it's low, you need more miners (and more power) to clear all the coins you need to get to 80x less than a forex-sized market.  but let the usd price jump up 10x to $2000 and now you're clearing 1/8th of a forex market with the same, today's, hashrate.
i don't know what conclusions to draw from any of this about how the price or the hashrate will change in the future, but i think it's fair to say that the nut holding back is going to be power generation, and miner density, because let's be blunt, you can only consume so much power per square foot before you get set on fire.  
that difficulty adjusts to hashrate is a whole extra dimension to this problem and, being non-negligible, cannot be ignored.  i'm not so clever as to know how to include that in my calculations though

if bakkt were only holding the bitcoins, that's true, but i think they're immediately selling them on their daily futures market. that's when a customer preloads their card, when a customer makes a purchase they'd buy back a little coin on their futures market. the risk is all borne by the market participants, they hold nothing (or just what they need to operate day-to-day)
besides, the price is going to go up anyway, right?
@_date: 2019-03-06 13:38:29
no sarcasm! maybe a bit tongue-in-cheek. but **it is** a cartel by definition...
who knows what they're going to charge. starbucks definitely wants to pay less than what visa&amp;co are asking, bakkt says they see a way to do it. [strike]( is a new processor that will let merchants accept lightning payments, they're asking 1% flat, i assume bakkt is going to target the same rough pricing. if bakkt isn't cheaper than visa, then they serve no point for starbucks
if they raise their fees, so be it, until bakkt jr. comes along and undercuts them....
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:13:03
and don't forget undercutting the existing visa/mc/discover payments "cartel"
(you see, they all charge the same minimum rates of 2%+$0.30/transaction, so it must be a cartel)
@_date: 2019-03-06 00:17:37
yes, i think that's right. and while your scenario might sound absurd on the face, it doesn't seem to me conceptually different than you and starbucks having and wanting dollars, but wanting to use visa or mastercard to actually move those dollars. 
so instead of having visa use its proprietary network to accomplish it (and 
charging starbucks a 2% + $0.30 fee), bakkt is going to do some shenanigans with bitcoin and futures markets to accomplish the same feat, and charge starbucks 1% and no flat fee (or who knows what their pricing model will be, but thats what other emerging processors out there like [strike]( are asking)
starbucks wants to accept cards, not cash, and they don't want to pay 2% for the privilege. bakkt thinks it can cut that rate in half using open source infrastructure, which seems very reasonable to me, open source has been doing that to every industry in the last couple decades
when all is said and done, i think it will feel to the customer like they have a special new "bakkt card" that they maybe have to prepay, and nobody who doesn't want to will have to know bitcoin had anything to do with it

that would be such a cliche old timer story, that you could be telling for the rest of your life
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:18:05
now that i think about it, it's not that dubious. this is really how bitcoin works. but you have to understand that the blockchain does things in a way that seems pretty awkward if we were going to do the same maneuver in real life.
what you have to realize is that when you "pay" someone, a transaction consists exclusively of a declaration like so: 


where 
* &lt;addr&gt; is the wallet containing X amount of BTC
* Y is how how much you want to pay Bob (Y &lt;= X)
* and &lt;addr-change&gt; is a new address that you hold private keys for 
(your wallet software handles all of this for you so you don't need to be bothered with all of this). 
and that's all the blockchain *is*, just lists and lists of declarations "I am Soandso, owner of X at A1, send Y to B, and the remainder to A2", and miners make sure those declarations never do anything _untruthful_ like declaring you have more in A1 than you do, or sending from A1 if you don't have the keys for it. Rules are rules ^(until ^they're ^not)
Now if you want to pay Bob *more* than X, then you'll need multiple addresses, right? and now your declaration has to ramble on, ....


so now your declaration (that you are humbly requesting that the network include in the next block) *is longer*. 
the block isn't limited to how many *transactions* it can hold, it's limited to how many *letters* can be written in it, and the fee is *per-letter*. so, a long declaration is like showing up with a sack of pennies, each of which you need to prove ownership of in your rambling decree.
*transactions can also have multiple outputs, you can send Y1 to B and Y2 to C etc, so long as (obviously) the sum of all the Y values (outputs) never exceeds the sum of all the X values (inputs). and, again, that takes more exposition for you to describe, and in turn costs more, proportionally
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:59:55
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:38:37
yes of course, before you broadcast a transaction you know how large it is. there's a thread here that gets into the nitty gritty, 
in most wallets when you are sending, there's a "view transaction" or "advanced" button, where you can see the transaction details and it should display the kB size of the transaction
basically you're looking at a minimum size transaction of in the neighborhood of 200bytes. also note that segwit brings that number down, _segwit transactions use fewer bytes_
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:20:04
the fees are scaled to the number of inputs you need to use. if you want a metaphor to the legacy world, you're paying for the "weight" of the sack of money you pay with.
if you pay with a crisp, brand new $100 bill, fees are very low. if you bring in a sack of pennies and nickles, it takes them longer to count and your fee will be higher.
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:37:53
i believe this is in fact how it works, by your own example, the bank has turned $10 (your deposit, M0) into $19 (the $9 loaned out and owed, plus your $10, M1).  when the loan is paid back, the bank **will** have $19, where did that $9 come from?






@_date: 2017-08-22 13:55:08
it is, yes.
miners *do* choose transactions with the highest fees. notice that fees are usually talked about in "satoshis per kilobyte", kilobytes are the constrained resource here. maybe you've heard people talk about block size, here it is, a block can only hold so many kilobytes (about a 1000KB..., ie, ~1MB)
so miners are incentivized to include _the transactions that have the highest fee per kilobyte_, ie, people paying sack-of-penny rates but actually $100 bills.
if you get paid in pennies for weeks and now you want to go to the store, and you only have sacks of pennies, you have a higher fee. you could say there's a fee for "converting pennies into bills", and during low-fee mining periods (if blocks were emptier for some reason), you might want to take advantage of that situation by going to the bank and cashing up your penny sacks at a discounted rate

well the investors might be interested in holding that hedge, maybe they are dealing with a lot of international currencies, and they don't want to select one to "prefer" - so here's another choice for them
but the way i'm seeing this, is that bakkt is trying to offer a payments solution for merchants, and the futures contracts are a way for bakkt to allow investors to profit from providing liquidity to those consumers and merchants. so i don't think they're only offering the contracts because it's a product investors want (though it is), but because it's a key mechanism in an overall strategy to serve several markets simultaneously
i wouldn't be surprised if many of the consumers (bakkt card holders) and merchants (we accept bakkt cards here) were both de facto "contract investors" by signing up with the service, they just don't have to be aware of it for the system to function

why not make it cost a lot of energy? i think in the long term it incentivizes creation of renewable generation capacity
edit: reflecting on this, proof-of-work is proof-of-ununsed-energy-generation-potential. it's literally a signal saying, "we can't find a buyer for the energy we're producing at the rate we want, so let's burn it into the blockchain until we can, that's better than nothing" and maybe they say this every evening at 6pm when the sun goes down, with demand, and the rates go up. i think tying our token of economic potential to energy generation _potential_ makes sense

yea, you're right, in order to enforce a "smart" contract, all the conditions need to be digitized in some way. you can't trade one set of restrictions away and not expect to get another.
"Payout upon gardening and yardwork" might be a little bit of a difficult proposition for this (but it could be done), and the example that comes to mind readily is a little bit jaded, but it illustrates it well. Imagine that somebody out there was encoding all the scores of basketball games onto a blockchain somewhere, somehow. If people trusted that these records were accurate, then they could be used as the basis for one premise of a contract like this. Say you wanted to set up a smart contract as a wager on who would win a game, now you have funds tied up ready to be dispersed based on the data found in the next output of that oracle, the Basketball Scores Oracle. If the team you chose got the win, funds go to your address, if not, they go to the counter party's
I'm not saying it's simple, or that every case that our financial-legal structure can accommodate today can be done on smart contracts of tomorrow (or today), but there's a new capability here that that legacy system doesn't have (and really, really wants to have): that of immutable contracts.
New capabilities are a very interesting thing, they don't come along often, especially at this scale, and they tend to have profound changes on the systems and infrastructure they disrupt.
All in all, my point is that I believe this is something worth paying attention to and not to be dismissed lightly.

not like this they don't.
in the legacy banking system, if any party to a contract decides not to hold up one of their obligations, or is unable to, you probably need to go to court and resolve it using some kind of justice system. which results in essentially more obligations forced onto the negligent party. (and guess how you resolve those if that didn't make you whole? ad infinitum)
in this system, that can't happen. let that sink in. it's literally impossible to defy the contract, it simply can't happen.

i'm not sure if the technicals allow for this, but couldn't a tipper prepare a preimage of a transaction, essentially locking the funds they intend to tip for the duration of the life of the transaction. if the tippee never arrives to claim the tip, it'd eventually expire (unless retracted by the tipper). but if they did show up, they can claim the payment with their own node.
then the tipbot is never a custodian of any funds, they are just the custodian of keys to activate an IOU, which, if never activated, never depart possession of the original owner
i guess the tipbot could get hacked and all those unclaimed tips stolen though

if you can't do it on your own, sooner or later you gotta trust someone somewhere. that's a tough prescription in this community, but it actually is a great environment to make this argument since everyone is so sensitive to trust and what that means. you know people are always willing to trade security for convenience, and this is just another form of that
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:30:46
but then the rabbit hole goes deeper. you want to use a blockchain to track property deeds? ok, now you have a blockchain that carries billions of dollars of value on its security. who guards that security? the handful of "miners" that this private blockchain system allows. what if one of them is hacked? now thieves can steal or alter all your property ownership records. 
there's some hyperbole in that, but the point is that no matter what application you want to run on a blockchain, you're going to want that chain to be secure. now, if you can just *outsource* that security and base it on an *already proven secure* blockchain (such as bitcoin or ethereum) then you've got a much higher level of security than you need, and it cost you nothing. 
so everybody does this, with all the bureaucracies that we decentralize into systems of tokens on top of blockchains, because it's simple, and it works. and as it happens, every new asset you do this to increases the value of that main chain even more. and the spiral continues
so while the blockchain part *is* the interesting revolution here, trying to make use of it without also using the security afforded by The Blockchain is a fool's errand. So the value of the technology *is* coupled to the value of bitcoin (or whatever blockchain you choose)

it replaces companies like visa, and also offers a novel use-case that no other platform has ever offered
currently, and historically, no where in the world has it been possible to conduct a financial transaction that totals less than the local equivalent of about $5, without using cash\* (using cash then restricts transactions to only those that can be conducted in the presence of both parties at a specific geographic location, simultaneously)
what kind of business models might exist where it would be profitable to charge people over the internet $1 frequently? how about $0.0005 millions of times a day? there's a lot of opportunity below that $5 line, and humanity has never had a chance to explore. i can think of a few interesting use-cases off-hand (tone down internet advertising! truly economically supported journalism!), but you should let your imagination run wild with it. it's certainly a revolutionary technology, in my opinion
\*the cutoff is about $5 because usually credit card transactions (the cheapest digital platform we have had) charge a flat fee of ~$0.30 and add a transaction fee of ~2.5%. so your $5 charge costs the merchant about (.30 + .025\*5) = ~$0.425, or roughly 8.5% of that $5 transaction, which is probably about how much profit they took on that to begin with. that's the *minimum*, transactions get cheaper from there (percentage-wise) as they go up in amount, but only because the total starts to make the flat fee negligible, 2.5% off the top is always going to be *a lot of money* - LN is several magnitudes cheaper

think of lightning like a coat check for bitcoin. you lock some up in an channel opening transaction, which appears on the blockchain, and receive a ticket. 
now you walk around and when you want to buy something you show your ticket to the vendor and they cross off what you were owed and write down the new amount, by subtracting how much you owe them. they also cross off their ticket and write a new larger amount that they're owed. *(cryptographic handwaves all assure nobody cheats here)*
when you're ready to go home, you head back to the coat check and get your ticket redeemed, for your total amount minus all the transactions you had as a closing transaction. the vendor goes to the coat check and receives back more than they originally checked in. 
there's no blockchain or evidence of transactions other than the tickets with their histories on them, and you would need to collect all of them to show all the steps.
also, when you do the whole ticket crossout dance with the vendor, it's actually you finding somebody who owes the vendor money (or somebody who owes somebody who owes the vendor money) and arranging for some of your checked-in bitcoin to end up on their account, and they in turn assign it to the vendor (and they also get a tiny fee for the service). the lightning network is all just long chains of people owing other people like this. opening a channel is just you starting a first deposit with your channel partner and declaring that anybody that owes them money can use you to pay them.

ok maybe i'm being hyperbolic, but if we're talking about visa and mastercard those are the base minimum processing fees they charge merchants. if you have super high volume, you might get a little break, but it's pretty much flat fee + % wherever you go. it's that that leads to a $5 minimum, because that's where your profit margins start to get seriously dinged by an 8.5% transaction charge. visa and mc don't want to do $3 charges (and they certainly don't want to do sub-cent transactions!), they don't make money doing that either. so they set up their pricing models this way, and made everybody fall in line
simplest proof of this is at [stripe's site]( - [visa makes it less clear]( i'm not going to dig in that. but i've built a lot of credit card processing pages, and these are always the fees. if everybody is charging the same fees, it's either the near the minimum cost, or some kind of cartel operating without competition
are there other payment methods? yes, are they as widespread? no, are they cheaper? probably only by a small amount. have we had this in history? well i know we had networks of banks so you could deposit in one, and withdraw from another far away for a long time (like in the crusades, and probably much longer ago) but surely they took a fee, and it probably had a flat fee component too. but i'm no expert in medieval banking price schedules, though now i think it's a really interesting question

it takes 1 bitcoin transaction to open or close a channel, so it will cost you your normal bitcoin fees at the times those events take place. 
(opening will cost slightly more usually, since to open you're probably spending from multiple inputs, though maybe not. to close you're always spending from one input, but you might spend to multiple outputs. fees are calculated per-byte remember, the more inputs and outputs you have the higher the byte count)

well one big thing i think that separates bitcoin from alts, and doesn't get mentioned a lot, is the credence of the origin story. it's an inspiring story of the little guy taking on the goliath of legacy systems armed only (as was david) with ingenuity and a precision shot. adding to that, the preservation of satoshi's anonymity was a brilliant stroke and anyone ever trying to do it again can only be second rate. and through some kind of jiu jitsu, the anonymity enhances the sincerity of the story, where in almost any other situation it would be a detriment.
bitcoin, *just like fiat* requires trust to succeed and the origin story has to be something *people will buy into*, literally. i think it would be very hard to tell a better story than this, and i think that's just one more reason why it should be difficult to unseat bitcoin

I don't think they are setting up this market for "gambling". They stated at the outset they wanted to create a payment method for merchants that would compete with the big credit card companies, and offer lower rates than they do (which is almost unilaterally ~$0.30 + 2%/transaction).
but how can they offer credit card level daily transaction volume for cheaper than the incumbents? the credit card companies need to charge those rates to keep solvent, and fund any transactions that consumers default on, and still have some left over for administration and making a profit. but a big part of their costs are that "float" between when they pay the merchant and when the consumer pays them (and they play all kinds of tricks to shift that risk to the merchants as much as they can too). 
Bakkt is looking at this system and seeing a way to basically make use of the security of the bitcoin blockchain to offload a lot of the technical aspects of this, and the futures market basically exists to manage the float. Now they are just a clearinghouse, can offer payment services using the pool of open daily contracts, and make fees on all the futures market trades at the same time. 
Basically they are planning on using bitcoin, and bitcoin investors, as the pool of reserve capital instead of holding it privately as the credit card companies do

that is an interesting service
reading your faq, and the response to the shared private key issue ("sadly..."), i wonder if there's a way to use multisig in order for a user to protect against the downsides of this?
i guess i'm thinking that when you provide the input funds you also provide something like a public key that can be used for the multisig and the private key your service returns will become the other sig. then the user can withdraw the coin safely, using their two signatures, the one they had prior to mixing and the one they receive from you after
if that works (which i am curious about) essentially it would mean that the private key you furnish would be not enough information to sweep those output coins, and the "before mixing" key would be the missing piece. end result: only the funding user can withdraw those outputs, no more unfortunate downside.
i'm no expert, just thinking about this idly. i hope that this idea may be useful, but i understand you've probably thought this service through much more deeply than i have. thanks for your interesting contribution to the cryptoconomy

In my mind, I don't see any way of reconciling this except by having independent blockchains on every planet.
You'll have to change your btc for mtc when you get there, and there will be a fee

it's per byte
some transactions will require more bytes than others because you'll need to include more than one "input" for the coins. So if you've received a lot of small payments, then your wallet may consist of what's called "dust transactions" and you might need a lot of inputs, thus requiring a lot of bytes, to create a transaction that spends them all
it gets a lot more complicated than this, due to the way the blockchain actually functions*, but this illustrates why transaction fees are independent of how much bitcoin you're actually trying to send. the fees are more closely related to how "complicated" the history of the source of your funds is.
*it's complicated, because non-intuitively, you can only spend entire inputs. what's done is that you specify your destination (who you actually want to pay) and a "change" address (the remaining balance, sent back to an address you control) when spending anything

banks seem to think that instant payments is the reason bitcoin is prospering and is the feature they need to offer in order to stem that tide. it's an easy sell in the board room too.

it's not a ponzi scheme, but the same game theory mechanisms that ponzi exploited in order to make his scheme run are also used by bitcoin. it's easy to get these concepts conflated.
the difference is is that these incentives were designed into the consensus algorithm from the start, in order to bootstrap and secure the network of a fledgling asset class, while ponzi used those concepts simply to perpetrate his fraud

it is, it's almost exactly the same, that's the point.  we're looking for trust here, bitcoin doesn't provide that.  the difference between the old and the new is that you don't *have* to use it.  you can just use bitcoin, b/c bitcoin basically has a payment mechanism built-in.  
right now the only way to pay somebody is mailing a check (backed by the bank), a credit card (backed by visa) or fiat (backed by an army).
MCP as i've described, is backed by bitcoin and is organized to provide services that bitcoin itself cannot offer

are you trying to keep the bitcoins you're paid, or convert them into dollars (or some other local currency) immediately on receipt?

if you had a substantial number of miners you could make a dent in prioritizing a % of transactions you attempted.   like on the order of a couple points of % of total network hash rate, *substantial*.  i'd think eventually we'll see business offering this service, taking a fee in exchange for prioritizing transactions using their mining datacenter
you could also raise the inclusion fee for the transactions, encouraging miners to hash your transaction into a block sooner, which is amounts to about the same thing, but much simpler

you're right, i didn't say why, but for the first, cash is 100% (in that if you have it, you can give it to somebody, that will always "work") and if we're replacing something we certainly don't want to lose an important feature.
obviously 99.999% is a number i made up to illustrate a point, but i believe is that *any* downtime is unacceptable.  
ok, buy why is it unacceptable?   i think the crux of that comes down to asking *when* that downtime comes.  if downtime *can* come, downtime *will* come, and most likely when you need it not to come most, like during a war say?  or a chaotic escape across a border?  maybe a storm is coming and you need to get food and go home, but so does everybody else and the money isn't working, that's bad.  
it's a slippery slope, and any downtime should be unacceptable.  the *possibility* for downtime should be *impossible*

whoops, that could be an issue.  certain places, certain times.  you don't want uptime on your money system at 99.999%, it's got to be 100%
i suppose what is needed is it to become common to use "local networks", maybe in places like this where bitcoin is taking off everybody carries a little dongle, a hardware wallet.  but the key feature is that it also has enough cpu to run bitcoind in the background and listen for connections on maybe an ad-hoc wifi network.  something so all these wallets are chattering out new blocks all the time, with the idea that somebody will connect to the global block chain at regular intervals and sync it to the network of all the folks shopping in local bazaar beyond network connectivity.
hell you could even set up some scheme to have an AM or FM station broadcasting new blocks and have them tune in to that

there are no coins.  
there are only wallets.  in fact, the picture posted by op is a picture of a "paper wallet".  it's shaped like a fiat coin, because people like that and think that's cute
a "wallet" is simply a pair of numbers, each nicely represented in a QR code, but there's many ways to store long numbers
1) the public address, is where you tell people to send coins when you want them to pay you
2) the private key, to put it simply, is the only number that exists that can "speak" for the public address.  it's the pursestring, anybody with the private key can send coins from the wallet, and without it there is no way to send coins from the wallet
wallets contain a number of coins, divisible to 0.00000001, or "1 satoshi".
so if you own (="possess the private key for") "1 bitcoin" you actually own 100 000 000 satoshis, because that's the smallest division that bitcoin allows (right now)
it's the blockchain that can tell you how many coins a wallet contains.  the blockchain is the list of every coin transaction ever, all mined coins, all coin movements.  so, your bitcoin client asks you your address, reads the gigabytes of blockchain data and deduces how many coins that wallet currently contains.  when you bought your millions of satoshis (ie, single bitcoin) they inserted an entry into the blockchain to put that many into the public address you provided (for which you presumably hold the private key).  they will stay there until a message signed with the private key is announced to the network that they will move somewhere else.
TL;DR, the lifecycle of a bitcoin is long and complex, originating in swampy marshlands and ending with the majestic flight of its flock as it migrates south to the 5th dimension and beyond

on the other side of the *coin*, it's also a race to more efficient energy production
and mining can also provide a rough guarantee of unlimited demand for energy, helping to provide even more incentive for R&amp;D
of course these things would only matter if there were *significant* mining operations, the likes of which we won't see in this generation, i don't think

loosely speaking, if the entire bitcoin market were a pool, the market cap (=current market price * number of coins=~$12bn today) is the amount of water in the pool.
if you "dump" a billion dollars into the pool there's now about 8% more water in the pool.  
and the key, since all the water looks the same, everybody's "personally owned" molecules in the pool (they're all owned by somebody) are each worth as much as the the ones on top are, which is just to divide the market cap, now $13bn in the example, by the number of coins, which stayed the same, and the current market price will be up by ~8%

well idk where this thread went, but the way i saw it was, 
a) OP: exchanges should exist in third world countries (de facto remote locations)
b) You: we shouldn't need exchanges there, because they should just use bitcoin directly, which can be used "anywhere with connectivity"
c) Me: but remote areas/third world have network isolation problems, so they can't use it directly, because without an "internet connection" all the nodes (people) can't even connect to each other.  and the connection to the global blockchain will probably have a certainty of some downtime in these areas, meaning adoption will be even harder (because over time probability == certainty, and people know that, if only innately)
but, if the hardware wallets could just talk (send packets) to one another locally then c) is not a problem, and b) will work, because complete systemic failure (an inability for anybody in a time/location to send or receive coins) will not be a consequence of severance from the global blockchain.
so TL;DR all of my posts here, P2P hardware wallets would be really neat-o and solve some problems for adoption in certain environments

the central problem with the scheme is enforcing the contracts.  just as bitcoin solves the problem of double-spending using a decentralized authentication scheme, the obvious, and probably only reasonable way to implement futures contracts for bitcoin would be to use the same mechanics.  ie, it has to be decentralized and mathematically impossible to violate the contract, just like bitcoin itself
idk how to do that, but off-the-cuff here i'm thinking of (yet another) fork of the bitcoin codebase that would provide this as it's mission.  so a bitcoin future is just sort of another type of cryptocoin, but tightly tied to the bitcoin price somehow, maybe by a programmed in lag.  i'm just rambling now so discuss..
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:55:32
well it's hard to use bitcoin in remote places where nobody has internet connections or a link to the global blockchain somehow.  turns out these places are also the same places OP is proposing for exchanges, and you propose that exchanges are not needed, as bitcoin transactions can be conducted directly with no fiat.  
so i proposed a local ad-hoc network with infrequent links to the global blockchain as a solution to this.

those are all problems that will affect only you, or, put another way, a single node in a network.  not systemic downtime affecting everybody who is part of the system in that instant of time and space.
the system should always work, it doesn't always mean your wallet will

suppose you're a store owner, you'll hire MyCoinProcessor ("MCP") to handle transactions for you, they'll accept btc from your customers and deposit btc in your account immediately, or maybe spot-price cash, or maybe there'll be a small delay before deposit, something guaranteed, like &lt;1hr. 
but the up-shot is, MCP takes a small % (0.1% say) and waits for the confirmations.  eventually, most of the time (how much, they can tell you), they'll get paid what they paid you.  they'll wait, they'll weather difficulty surges and miner strikes, they'll run their own miners to prioritize their transactions, they'll smooth the blockchain's adjustments because a smooth mining trajectory is good for their bottom line.
they bank the fees, and they'll absorb the small number of transactions that don't pay out.  they'd even investigate why not and find other channels for payment.  they'd act the middle man in the face of a consumer complaint to provide a refund (perhaps immediately, and follow up with you, the vendor)
they're visa, they're no different really.  it's a service layer atop the crypto ecosystem.  but the guts of this company are completely different to visa, fueled on cryptos not interest and debt.  and they're interested in keeping the the mechanisms that move the coin stable and in good health.
all these technicals about diff adjustment time and coin scarcity, they're looking at the system as it exists today, which is just a skeleton.  it's like supposing in 1988 that TCP/IP really won't really work out for one reason or another.  might be so, but the problems were dealt with.  we still have them, but nobody but the engineers care about them.  same will be of crypto, problems get abstracted from general view.
