What does it actually mean?
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:55:54
I take it you mean "poof" as in the sound of something disappearing!

Thanks for setting this up, very informative. I have joined the google plus circle, please feel free to let me know thru google + when this happens again :-)

Hi, thanks for post, I haven't heard anything about Jeb not wanting us to find out what happened. Do you have a source?
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:21:06
Never is a long time. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:09:42
Theres conflicting stories here .. is it really game over?
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:20:39
Hi, thanks for your insights ..  anything to back up your theory?
@_date: 2014-06-07 12:48:04
Ok, so i got the email, so theres no need to do anything then I take it.

Use armoury, and I wouldn't print it out with a printer that has internet connection either. Use armoury whilst offline too.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:00:32
your funny man ..  I didn't troll you, I think you trolled yourself. Rather than take advice from a marketing guy, you throw insults. Your game isn't the problem, you are the problem. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:57:42
In his shoes, would you go?
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:23:10
Wow, I'm very impressed with what you did there.
Will you be able to show the user ids or account ids with the top 500?
Congrats on your initiative to do this.
@_date: 2014-04-04 23:24:07
Yep .. is there a source for this?
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:01:56
Well, I'll just have to take your word for it.
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:54:11
OKCoin ..  interesting twist to the story.
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:54:44
don't get me wrong, I actually hope it is true.
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:55:50

How much would you like to pay?
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:27:35
I wouldn't be too sure about that, there could still be a buy out, it has not been ruled out.
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:53:35
I must have missed they news then .. i thought the announcements indicate a failure to self rehabilitate, buy outs were still a consideration. Where did you see a commencement to liquidate?
@_date: 2014-04-06 19:23:09
When exactly did this conversion happen?
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:57:53
Saving your post here .. please update in 4 years .. if reddit is still around.
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:52:50
I don't know if Japan is any more lax than any other democratic country.
Banking criminals/terrorists have been getting away with financial crimes all over the world.  Also, we don't really know what criminal investigations are going on or who else might be behind the mtgox debacle. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:13:38
btw ..  the bitcoin community talks about price, lost coins because its important to them. I wouldn't start my social media campaign by saying bitcoin users talk crap and don't add value to the ecosystem. .. but seriously, good luck with your project.
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:38:44
:-) .. maybe just repost after the 4 years .. great experiment there.
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:26:06
I read somewhere he's still got 400K still there, but don't remember where I read that.
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:48:33
Yes, I hope so too, for bitcoin's sake.
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:53:29
If you are on the team, I wish you best of luck with this.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:42:02
So you would bet with odds 1:1000 that either: 
1 - Mtgox users won't get coins back or a part of their coins back?
2 - That mtgox users will over estimate their chances of getting their money back.
Option 1 or 2?
I'd love to take that bet with you :-)
@_date: 2014-04-30 00:06:58
It would seem that no exchange is fully worthy of trust for huge purchases, Buy in small amounts and move them to a cold wallet. Minimise the risk, at least until a decentralised exchange hits the market.
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:39:43
I thought we moved on to kittens already.
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:35:25
I didn't know that, thanks for telling me
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:37:38
How can it not? I am big on bitcoin, but I wouldn't be buying any right now, but I wouldn't sell up either.
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:08:37
Invest what you can live without .. very high risk.
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:09:33
Sorry, is that what the 500 Gox traders stuff points to?
That it wasn't adoption and the chinese coming into the market?
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:35:01
Hey .. thanks for that .. I'm ok with OKPay.. might be a pretty good solution after all.
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:59:30
.. like you said, you don't see what is soo complicated about it … BUT..


If you can round up a collective to spend millions of dollars a day to "maintain your holdings" then you have a skill worth far beyond what ever your btc holding are.


The chinese ! :-)
Everybody is selling BTC .. there are no sides here.
I doubt any "chinese" is doing anything to us.
Try selling high and buying low, don't fight the trend, follow it.
Trying to swim against the current will exhaust you and kill you financially.
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:28:34
Thanks :-) ill check it out.
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:17:11
Wow .. ok .. i need to look at that then. Thanks
@_date: 2014-05-20 08:50:52
Hey .. thanks for coming here on reddit to talk to us.
For the moment, I support this project and am even thinking of contributing to the project myself.
OKPay is a good option. 
When do you expect to launch?
How long do you think before the web client will be ready with the OKPay option? 
I can't wait to see a project like this take off.
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:31:31
my my ..  as soon as anyone critizes blockchain.info, the name calling begins .. saying the OP is stupid or full of shit doesn't represent a good argument.
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:24:44
Where did you see this? I didn't find a mention of OKPay in the slide show and wiki.   Is the client operational yet?
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:36:06
Cmon guys, join in and ask your questions.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:24:46
So whats the odd then for your bet?
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:02:57
Fantastic, can you tell us any more?
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:54:51
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:47:54
I don't think everyone thinks its dead .. infact, the mtgox attorneys just announced they found 200k for the rehabilitation
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:15:06
Stranger leaks have happened, and some leaks are intentional. I wonder if this goes anywhere.
@_date: 2014-03-20 09:53:13
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:20:00
Is there a betting site for the mtgox coins recovery, id like to see what the market odds are.
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:03:05
:-) ..  funny… and also probably illegal, which is something many bitcoiners would enjoy.
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:44:05
Directly from your source, who apparently knows mark. 
Does your source know anything else thats interesting? Anything worthy of a leak?
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:50:39
Mtgox issues are still not resolved .. uncertainty is bad for the market.
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:07:59
I don't think you'll get a good answer here. It depends on what coins you mine, and also, how and when you convert that coin to fiat or another coin. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:22:36
I don't think its 0 .. I would probably say about 50% if the rehabilitation starts up. Although, you might only get 23% of the coins if they only found 200K
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:35:45
The paste bin indicates the conversations happened late jan and early feb ..  is this an old chat?
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:31:31
Sorry to hear that.  150 went to  .. and it's sitting there it seems.
I think it moved on the 18th of this month, from   or maybe I'm looking at it wrong.
Did you perhaps spend and some funds went to a change address?? 
Best of luck, I feel for you.
@_date: 2014-06-20 08:42:26
it looks like an interesting project, I'm looking forward to a release.
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:36:26
funny .. true.
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:13:26
You seem determined, I'd hate to pop your bubble .. good luck with this post :-)
Perhaps you should hit the streets man .. get more users on board, alot of bitcoin holders have already invested what they can, we need more fresh blood.
.. but consider my advice in previous posts perhaps.
Whats the difference between 1000 btc's at $500 or 2000 btc's at $250?
Sell high, buy low, you might find it's more effective to make money like that then to encourage reddit users to spend 20% of their fiat at the risk of being bag holders.
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:29:47
Thanks for posting this. Appreciated.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:01:26
In the US perhaps, but these things can change very quickly. For the rest of the world, not really.
@_date: 2014-05-28 12:01:40
Has anyone with a verified account and btc at Gox not received this?
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:12:03
Maxcoin is actually great, try it and see, super fast confirmations.
i think its 6 confirmations in 30 seconds. Plus .. its supposed to be asic proof and other bollucks like that.
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:36:58


Wifi Packets? . sorry .. is this script a variation from some wifi open source system?
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:23:49
I would love to know how that is done too.
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:46:07
lol :-)
 ..  are you proposing to "pump" btc? 
So what happens if the price keeps dropping?
Basically, if the price keeps dropping, you just encouraged more redditors to become bag holders.
Another thing to consider is not to leed more guys down that road and improve your own btc holdings by selling high and buying low, like other successful traders.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:05:44
That would be bad, especially for those who were trading the last few days including those who used bitcoin builder too. Ofcourse, it would be great for Anarchystar, as he would double dip, got his coins out using bitcoinbuilder, then get the coins he sold back coz the last few days were wiped clean. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 01:54:57
It sure is amazing, and its great to see such great investigative work being done. Thanks
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:59:16
It's being worked on by a few, nothing concrete has come out, I think theres a few being tested swell, but I didn't save the link, sorry.
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:54:10
Agreed. The btc price indicates that the market is not ready to move on.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:56:19
Bitcoin, I can't believe its not money!
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:47:57
Very interesting indeed.

@_date: 2014-07-16 20:03:53
I would say exactly the same thing.  Except now he's on twitter and started to give the impression that there is no gag order. Anything less than the scenario you mentioned is unforgivable. Unless something even more bazaar is revealed. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:59:58
OKCoin is bidding for MtGox and we should know soon .. looks like a team of OKCoin guys are meeting with Japanese Courts/Lawyers next week to discuss.

@_date: 2014-04-28 00:49:10


How on earth did you get soo smart and generous?
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:47:40
Are you saying that 20% of subscribers in the sub-reddit are scammers? Where did you get this percentage?
Also, Are you saying scammers don't manipulate the stock market?
Look, I see your point, bitcoin/altcoins have many scammers, but to think the stock market is free of scams is a little naive.
I think you may have fallen for the ultimate scam in believing that.
No offence, just an observation.
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:11:40
That would probably be a better scenario .. might have to give it back!
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:14:55
Mmm .. I wonder if this is true IRC chat .. "Nothing was stolen" ? lets see .. it also seems to be a conversation with the alleged hacker there too.

@_date: 2014-03-20 18:46:44
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:00:12
So .. what your saying is you want bitcoin to be for people like you.
@_date: 2014-06-22 14:30:43
hadn't thought of that, might be very interesting.
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:54:39
Good news anyone? lol .. i did it.
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:44:57
Cool .. so the c64 is the POS ..  I'm impressed .. good to see technology recycled, just for the sake of it. :-)
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:54:20


Bitcoin will find a way without NY .. fingers crossed.
@_date: 2014-04-29 23:41:18
If there was a way to do this with a decentralised ledger, then perhaps it would be a good idea.
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:18:14
opps .. you contributed a comment :-) 
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:05:57
China + MtGox was very good for the price late last year.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:19:38
If MK gets all the coins back, theres going to be a lot of happy people with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:36:49
I must say…
I feel for Olivier, he lost a lot of money, and sounded like he made some hard decisions, such as using bitcoinbuilder and getting only 23% of the coins out, which probably resulted in 4 million loss, which was about 10K coins. 
And onto of that, he sold about 2.5K coins for fiat in GOX, about 400K USD still in GOX, man .. he must have had some sleepless nights. 
Best of luck to him, his loss is huge.
He also presents himself very well, especially on the hangout you made. 
And I wanted to say thanks again for doing it. I appreciate your great work with the hangout. Please do more.
BTW .. thanks for asking the question I posted in QA in the hangout about Oliviers suggestion to roll back the trading to Feb 7th.
 
I appreciated his response, especially considering his loss, and I would also understand his motives for this, it would of course provide him with a 4 million dollar gain in coins, but unfortunately at the expense of those who bought his gox coins using bitcoin builder and anyone who deposited USD etc to buy coins on the exchange from Feb 7th onwards.
Olivier, I understand and appreciate your motives here, but I would see this as a disaster to many many users. I hope he doesn't press this any further.
anyway, Fibbrmarketplace .. thanks for everything.
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:00:56
Nice use for c64, but I see a POS machine right next to it .. is the c64 just for displaying invoice??

…opps …  i forgot .. all websites exist forever !
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:16:10
The market is waiting to see what's happening with gox perhaps. It might be months still before an up movement, but who knows.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:20:10
Its LIVE Now 
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:29:03
Perhaps .. I look forward to hearing more on this, fingers crossed for mtgox users this is true.
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:34:20


I must have been living under a rock :-) ..  when did this launch or start?
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:53:24
i think its speculation ,nothing indicates trading bots inflating price thru internal arbitration as someone said here .. it would be good to see proof rather than just talk.
@_date: 2014-04-30 00:13:51
If its true, I wonder who was in favour of returning the BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:07:47
Fingers crossed for you.
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:16:21
Well said.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:07:53
lol . how true is that.

@_date: 2014-03-20 12:41:45
I call bull on this.
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:51:34
Is that considering all the coins that have been moving around? If so, then another announcement might be coming.
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:18:48
Fingers crossed it was just an incorrect email, apparently it has  been happening lately, also .. FYI, it seems that some users get cranky if you criticise or complain about blockchain.info .. just giving you a heads up :-)
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:18:46
Don't encourage this.
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:35:24
what was the joke?

Thanks for that .. and happy reddit birthday to you.. theres a cake icon near your name.
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:09:28
Ive worked in marketing for the last 5 years, and I think you may have thought it was going to be easy with social media.. it takes time, but if your project is good and people like you and your website, it will work. Try harder, don't give up that easily.
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:37:07

Perhaps speak for yourself.
If the profits can help partially pay off the 120K traders that lost money, then I don't have an ethical problem here.
I suppose there is also no ethical problem with asking for donations either.
@_date: 2014-07-19 01:48:54
right ..  absolutely right.
