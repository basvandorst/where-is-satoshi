Meh, it's all BS, just practice for the big players using OP $$. In fact, the more crypto people getting interviewed on various biz TV channels appear obvious they have no friggin clue WTF they are talking about and spit out erroneous BS, most notably ico creators, devs and all those involved in X-shitcoin, and those who also get in on the funding.... that's where the $$ is..... @ the top of the chain, after that... crumbs for those who like to gamble, or speculate in technical terms... :-]

And I don't think my maintenance account could cover the 100k minimal investment they are suppose to require. Read in DJ news about a week ago...

"but it's far from user friendly."
Agreed, is it true I need BTC full node to compliment a LN node  in order to allow Tx's ? I'm thinking this could be a cool project for this winter.
@_date: 2018-09-25 14:10:24
I just can't seem to get a grip on the LN for end user efficiency. Will they actually want to open/close &amp; fund channels to use, or will the client perhaps warn what is needed to complete the tx's? If LN is destined to become mainstream, I've been thinking of creating a node using a RPi to run 24/7 and fund it to allow tx's.... I'm on a 200Mbps cable which easily averages 213-222Mbps consistently..

People gonna believe what they want to believe, but it's just more deep pockets wanting to control the btc price through buys/sells so the RSI becomes stable and the sec approves the ETF paper.... I'm seeing more and more every day, there's more happening outside of reddit subs...
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:14:52
Now it's all starting to look like a BS OP? Imagine being a company starting a new year with a fresh payroll account and now paying employees 40% more (bitcoin) to meet their salary since bitcoin is hovering @ 60% down for the year..... not sure that's good business sense?
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:11:10
You are correct, and just recently the rise was caused by a few big banks working on an ETF approval (watching now on tv to remember who), big investors started a buying frenzy and btc shot up,, SEC wants more info and a selling frenzy started and btc is going back down. It's been that way, and those who disbelieve are sadly delusional.
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:24:53
Nothing new... ALL the big banks now showing interest in crypto in fear they will be left behind. While some analysts are looking @ use cases, most banks are already working with blockchain for client account privacy, data transfer, etc...

Play the game, I bought a drone part from a company over there through ebay, waited the usual 6\-weeks and nothing, sent a email and got very apologetic replies they would fix problem, opened case with ebay, still emails from japan.... I returned emails in the same tone with solutions for them, as in send part or return money..... 10 weeks later they returned money \(even while case was ongoing\), $3.85. LOL, yup, it was the principle. Play the \(their\) game in a persistent manner.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:22:20
That's great, how do you ensure that you will always get the proper amount and what's the fee involved if you cash out? I don't believe in anything that friggin much when it involves $$ to incur costs.... not even my 3 ex-wives ... bwahaha
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:04:18
Whats it pay? a.k.a. show me the $$
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:17:04
I think he's saying that world economies can exist on peoples' bitcoin accounts only.... how that translates into GDP, trade, M&amp;A, business cash flow...... is beyond me
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:46:36
That's great! but, none of my local gas stations, supermarkets, restaurants, vape stores, etc... take BTC, perhaps hibernate and return when btc is universal pay?
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:12:27
Isn't this similar to shaking out the weak? Those who prefer to ride off the shirttails of the serious contributors in the investment both current and future? Those who whine over the price drop, have no understanding of risk factor yet want huge daily profits? Those are the ones who discourage future development and cause decay, just like in the equities markets. Yup, the ones who laughed @ me when I bought 1000's of Starbucks @ the split adjusted price in 2008 for $8.76/sh.... yeah, that look.. the look of "why didn't they listen", I'm still smiling, and hodling the BTC
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:48:50
Must be more payouts? LOL, I see cnbc &amp; bloomberg all day while trading the markets and no mention of this bs.

And imagine if a *Reality Star* asks her fans if anyone even cares about bitcoin like the *Reality Star* asked if anyone even uses Snapchat anymore,,, and it drops over 1.2billion in revenue during the next hour, yeah, that kind of insanity.

In my world that would get me a Do Not Pass Go ticket and behind bars....
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:07:10
Actually I think it may be one of few BofA bank will deal with. I've heard several negatives when cashing out though. I could open account and transfer some of my btc from my private wallet to cash out? Or would I need to buy from/mine to them first?
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:32:13
That's a plus, I've looked into them before and they are the most mentioned on Bloomberg I watch while trading stocks... also gonna check with bank for any weird restrictions. Probably going to need 6\-7k transferred 
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:44:15
Sure, I didn't lose that much but my snap stock dropped to my &lt;5% loss sell order...
EDIT: so, if people worry that much about price fluctuation in BTC, now they can have more to worry about
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:25:23
Checking them out also, I've never thought about this stuff until now. Looks like all the exchanges have their pros &amp; cons, so I'm hoping to use the one with the least hassle
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:11:48
Or, currently how do we explain to someone who has ($)100 in their BTC wallet and 2 weeks later they go to pay the cellular co., and find that it's now only ($)65? 
@_date: 2019-02-07 13:20:22
50/50 chance of Bitcoin snow soon?
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:50:53
Exchange rates could become massive in everyday-all day usage unless it perhaps replaces the tax system? Also, volatility will be another huge factor since most in today's world live week to week and penny to penny. I think bitcoin is a great concept and don't really have argument, but I think it's still years away and that somehow when regulators get involved it (btc) won't be the product we all hoped for. I had fun mining it, converted my mined Altcoins to it and stuffed it in an offline wallet while I watch this scenario play out.... if I live that long :-)
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:32:05
Ok, but how do we arrive @ that figure? A Bitcoin analyst/investor on Ameritrade Network yesterday mentioned that the current resistance to bitcoin is not so much the idea as it is the amount of research/learning and real life intricacies of using it. I don't see how bitcoin could possibly sustain an unregulated currency vehicle.
@_date: 2019-02-07 13:13:11
That, and bitcoin is still too early in development for me to explain to family. Except my youngest son who, if he can implement tech on his phone he's good to go and already plays with BTC wallets/useage. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 12:56:29
Of course!! And no doubt the vast majority of humans wake up and rush to their phones to read more about segwits,base layers,3rd layers, security advantage,hash power,validation,chains, and all that cool stuff. And, no need for regulation, so no need for taxes, or GDP, governments, all those irritating aspects of life like world economys. And, I have to wonder, if the USD was removed, or any other  currency for that fact, what would the value of our bitcoin be now? What would it be based on? Stones? Oh, maybe Tethers, no wait.... what would be that value now? ..Since that's what many exchanges store your bitcoin as..... wait, would the Exchanges be able to cover what we hodl now? What would the value be?

Wait to see large institutions get more involved with their created ETF's so many are hungry for,, and then, they become the ruling HFT's with algo loaded quantum machines, and the Crypto exchanges start drying up from lack of sufficient funds to cover....bwahahahaha
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:01:46
I'll upvote that since you are about spot on. Analysts are confident that Bitcoin will become just a *storage of value* (like gold) to ensure payment for the transfer of contracts/data/inventory/shipping/etc by those developing/using Blockchain (like ETH) to provide those transfers. Perhaps Tether (USDT) will be the actual $$ used, IDK. But all day while trading stocks this is what I'm reading or seeing on tv. Blockchain is the main interests of the Big Guns...as you mention. Myself, I can see that happening.
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:58:27
Not sure if this provides some thought, but a good read
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:59:09
Thank you, you just posted my thoughts. So many have no understanding of investing.... like the silly technical graphs they try to create on a *commodity*

yeah, here they come all the Media pundits who practice the *Art of Delusion* that all the weak minds love to follow...
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:13:36
So if BTC disappears right now, what are all your other cryptos' worth? My post reflects exactly what I've heard a half dozen times by developers/analysts guests on bloomberg &amp; cnbc all last week. There's more development/practice and use cases going on now that you obviously don't pay attention to
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:36:36
Another fine example why people are anxious to adopt BTC for their everyday currency...

People will believe what they only want to believe, just like gpu mining, they still believe they will bank millions in a short time. Now, I can see all types of financial/institutional vehicles developing in the crypto ecosystem. So, here are a few folks *in the know* as far as what we know today... tomorrow will change:
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:35:09
maybe ask for USDT since most exchanges do NOT have the proper amount of USD to back up their shit during this extended bear mkt?
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:53:46
Or perhaps you haven't been around long enough, but yes, it is genuinely true. Back then I ate Big Macs &amp; fries everyday from different stores depending what area I was in. Years later, when they brought it back I tried one @ a few different stores and they are NOT the same.... just as I described. All these fast food chains should get Reps on the road and experience what many people are getting and then maybe they could increase sales. To be fair, I still trust McDonalds far more than the competitors but miss a REAL big mac

That's what r3 is working on, Quickbooks will have to get on board or be left behind
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:58:49
Yet, the recent drop as per (Bloomberg) report is caused by the ETF rejection as well as the RSI index is not inline with recent price increase (or paper value), which points to the fact that regulatories are involved, so even building on the idea of decentralization is being hindered  and will continue to be so.... The involvement from regulators is much greater than we are seeing in print, aka, the *Big* picture
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:26:14
Much wall st buzz about it, I noticed a few days ago in my thinkorswim software under *social sentiment* (good list for whats hot) watchlist that there was a ticker for BTCUSD and today I noticed another for ETHUSD, both currently inactive, *or* being used for testing or a placeholder for something coming up. IDK but all my crypto mining gets converted to BTC &amp; held.

True, plus big-macs aren't even close to what they were 35yrs ago. They used to have better beef, shredded lettuce, real cheese, and a genuine special sauce.
