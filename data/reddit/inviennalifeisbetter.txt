I've tried to pay with bitcoin here multiple times. Hasn't happened once. Staff don't want to know, and are annoyed by you asking. 
These guys are just jumping on the bitcoin marketing bandwagon. Classic hipster shoreditch

I bought my nephew a trezor for his first christmas present. will be topping it up every birthday and special occasion. I like the idea of him having something physical and it's at least relatively secure

I dunno... Each of those things may have lent support to the price. As something like bitcoin grows it becomes influenced by thousands of different factors which all contribute. Knowing about as many of them as you can gives you the best shot at knowing what the price might do.
This is just another of the factors that's good to know about. People are using bitcoin in Russia ahead of the world Cup... Good to know

Her actions were what they were, and are not really relevant to bitcoin. Approve of her or disapprove I found the Atlas shrugged excerpt an interesting read considering bitcoin has redefined what we consider money

Why both having all the region specific Googles? Surely if one gets it they all will?

"Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force."
bitcoin seems to work against the "looters" (government in Randian) and the "moochers". I imagine she would have approved of the nature of bitcoin

Arguably she was but that doesn't mean she didn't have some interesting ideas on the concept of money and ownership, two things that Bitcoin has changed a lot

You'd need a Blomberg terminal or a factset subscription or similar. Both cost silly money

forbes writers get paid per click 
it's a cancerous journalism model and there should be a site wide ban on the domain

i wish I'd invested in Google in 1996. looking back is pointless, look forward. but remember nothing is a sure thing and any investment can go back

Probs just could fit the detail in the headline

these people aren't progressives, just because they say they are. they're at the top of the system and don't see its flaws. They don't see a problem with the system being as it is because they have only benefitted from it. When something threatens that system that thing must be bad, because for them the system is good.
