One of the main reasons I think this is probably legit is the number figure. 
132,158 BTC would range anywhere from $15,000 to $8,000 for the price of BTC at the time. This is right in line with what the best builders in SL were getting to build sims. 
Why did he not cash that out? 
Because he was using it for his hobby. Buying server space with enough Prims to do major builds could get pretty expensive at the time and so it is very likely he was paid in BTC and was using BTC to buy prims and sims and when he stopped playing he just left it there. 
In all honesty WTF else would he have done with it between 2010 and 2013?

As a former SLer I can confirm that everything in SL could either be all consuming and also easily forgettable. Some people were on SL for money but the vast majority were there for either Building, Playing Dress Up, Watching Pixels Fuck, Or Music.  
People spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on SL clothing, skin and land and for them it was all just the price of entertainment and once you stop playing the entertainment is over.
I can totally believe that someone who only used bitcoin in SL and considered it part of SL could stop playing and assume that bitcoin was only a Second Life currency. 
Also there are many people who pay zero attention to news or finance and much less the price of an Alt Currency and I think most of the people in this forum are a little to engrossed in Bitcoin news to even conceive of the possibility that it means absolutely zero to most of the people in the world.

A friend asked me why bitcoin is all but invisible for a year or two and then pops back up with the same story of Surge and Crash, but why does it seem to never die or fully take hold?
He, like 99.9 percent of humans keep zero tabs on Bitcoin until national media pics up on a big price run and I am exhausted preaching to people who already have their own set of beliefs.
"Why do you cast your pearls among the swine?"  
But to answer his question as briefly and succinctly as possible I said
 "It has not taken off in the mainstream because it is a new technology that has yet to become extremely user friendly and the entry barrier seems daunting.  It will never go away because while it has a thousand ways that it can positively change the world Bitcoin at its most base function is the best way to send money cheaply, and purchase naughty things online relatively anonymously. That one function alone makes Bitcoin insanely undervalued. As long as Bitcoin can just do that, it will be viable and will never go anywhere but up over the long run.

Possibly the greatest long game plot point of any book series ever. I began reading the series in 1998 and did not get to find out what Hodor was talking about till that episode aired. 
For thousands of pages GRR Martin kept this gem in his pocket. The directors, producers and actors of the show deserve a lot of credit for pulling it off perfectly because GRR seems to have just given up on it.

Is there any count of how many millionaires have been created in the last month from bitcoin?

I really do not think the bubble pops till $80. 
Bitcoins will be spilling out of wallstreet TV talking heads mouths like vomit at a frat party by the end of the week. This time next week the people who worship Jim Kramer will be waiting for his sound effect to hit the buy button and that will be the last group of people to the party. 
I expected this to move slower and pop sometime just before June but its moving much faster than I had wanted only because I have not had the funds together to invest the way I wanted to. 
I would have been happy to get in at $35 but that has all gone by the wayside. I will still gamble at $50 but after that I will just have to wait till this particular bubble pops and it settles back down in the $20 range.

Well I think the number of people who thought I would have shorted the mark by no less than a $100 would have been all of zero.

Well it hit $80 much earlier than I would have thought and I thought I was being very aggressive with it. I was able to but in at $45 but only a couple hundred dollars worth. Not willing to go in heavy at this point but with Europe going ape shit its hard to get a feeling how for this will swing up before falling. 
I still think it will end up back in a high $20's to high 30's before the end of summer but I think it might get well over $100 before we see that sell off.

I have been looking at bitcoin for about a year now and have not really had the money to invest but I am hoping I will have a decent infusion I can put into bitcoin within a month and I plan on buying $3,000 worth as well as putting 3 grand into some kind of mining rig.
I always believed that the currency had serious potential but it was not until I noticed that it had become the currency of choice for cam girls and the online porn industry that I was sold. I remember my dad telling me about the old VHS vs BETA battle when home video started. BETA was clearly the better system but the porn industry chose VHS and that is what the standard became.
It will be everyone's little porn secret that I think gets people familiar with bitcoin and I can feel the wave cresting quickly now and I am hoping I can get my investment together because I think the next three to four months are going to be a rising wall of profits where you will see values hitting 50 to 80 dollars. There will be a crash of course but I think it will stabilize in the 20 dollar range and then start a long steady climb. I will be ecstatic if I can still buy in under 35.
