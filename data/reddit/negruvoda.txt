Why do you say that?

I did not say this - hence the quotes around karma, followed by a definition of what I was talking about. 


That's the point I'm trying to make - don't put good out there just for the sake of it returning to you.
Stop trying to 'game' the system, there's nothing to 'game' over life. We struggle in life chasing wild, social dictated dogmas. Mass media exploits some really vulnerable human conditions and defines this 'game' you have  to 'win' in life. We're being spoon fed idiotic concepts of happiness - which itself is the most complex and diverse state a person can be in.


This is pretty much a contradiction. Protect yourself, yes, correctly put. What is this 'clan' you are talking about? Sounds like another geopolitical construct, an illusion we comfort ourselves. I get that we enjoy oxytocin in life, but we need to be self-aware of how restrictive we are with our social circle and reject everything else, more so we get aggressive towards outsiders. 
Let's say we're being invaded by some alien life form that intends to indiscriminately eradicate human life - do these 'clans' still exist in this context? Is it still the optimal strategy in life to seclude ourselves to these small social circles?

There is no such thing as karma - thinking in "karma" implies a quid pro quo which shouldn't be the reason to be kind to others. Being kind and honest to others should be something fundamental in human collaboration, for the benefit of everyone.
