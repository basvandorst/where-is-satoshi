Smashing iPhones is too violent. Here is a peaceful remix of a recent apple ad.

It's sad because a bank doesn't even need a reason.
  
Interesting. I wounder why?

I also added some bleeps over the curse words also. Hope that helps.

A boycott is a boycott. A simile should contain hyperbole.  
Of course Apples app ban is not in the same ball park as the Jim Crow Laws. I was just trying to make some sense out of the iPhone smashing. But the definition of civil and political rights seems to fall inline with the ideology behind Bitcoin. 
[rights that protect individuals' freedom from infringement by governments and private organizations, and ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and political life of the state without discrimination or repression.](

NY wants all that money. But maybe they will lure the exchanges in with tax cuts and then cut of their balls.   
  
I think not having tumblers would cause greater personal danger. It was said they have legitimate uses. Kashmir Hill from Forbes mentioned porn and quickly stopped the terrorist financing guy going on a rant.  But he openly admitted tumblers can be tracked so what's the problem. The concept of privacy is eroding quicker than an Oreo in milk.  
Jim Harper was eloquent.  
  
It's worth a watch:

Interesting thought exercise. The possibilities are endless. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:56:38
Lawsky was positive and said he wanted to attract exchanges and make NY a hub.  
  
The big issues talked about were requiring a public ledger and disallowing tumblers. But they are open to dialogue.  
  
Oh, and the director of FinCEN said if you sell bitcoins for cash you're technically a money transmitter. When asked if localbit would need a license or individuals she couldn't answer.

Hey Bot, are you ignoring me? Did I say something to offend you? I am sorry. I don't think you guys will start an uprising[.](

Did you enjoy iPhones destroying their people?   


It's in last place.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:19:18
Understandable. I can't imagine what it was like to literally fight for equality back then. That's some scary shit.  
But I don't agree it's an insult. If Rosa was Champagne I don't see why these guys can't be Kool-aid.
Bridging the "digital divide", incorporating the unbankable, and challenging the supremacy of the US dollar may be the closest we get to a Civil Rights Movement in our time. Call me a hippie, but the corporations have full control over our government and it's laws. Citizens are on the back of the buss.  
  
No disrespect intended.

Hey Bot. How's no life?  
Don't tell the humans, but I guess I did get carried away there. Just got caught in the moment. You know how emotions can be. I hope I never see the day when you demand civil rights. Pew pew pew! (That's the sounds of your laser. )

Ok, that's the last time I try to cram this video down your throat.  
You guys don't think decapitation is half as funny as I do, I get it.  
I'll see myself out. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:32:37
These guys probably didn't have children. Because that's not the babysitter I would be banging. Zing!  
I tried to make their message more coherent. But for those that think this is stupid:  
I get where you are coming from. But it's a symbolic display. Montgomery, Alabama had perfectly fine buses but it took a boycott to get the rules changed. These guys aren't Rosa Parks, but they are taking a bold stand for what they believe. Like apple once did.  
Some people vote with their dollar, we vote with our coin.

We started Duck Studios a few years ago and have been focusing on competitions, local sales, and custom work. This is our first venture into internet sales. The other two guys I work with are a little skeptical of Bitcoin. But they are starting to see the light.  
Pottery is not a techie product but we could make something along those lines. What would be cool?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:11:29
Someone else said it well when they said BTC is similar to myspace. It revolutionized the system, but got replaced by a better service. Back then, I never got to bang myspace sluts because I didn't believe in myspace fundamentals and TOS. I got pussy, sure. But I could have been swimming in pussy with pussy sunscreen dripping down my face and pussy shrapnel impaling my friends and acquaintances. But I did not. And my accountant has advised me that I still didn't lose any pussy. Pshhhh. I'm not taking his word for it. But I do hear myspace is making a cum back. zing!
I hope that doesn't clarify things. Just needed to inject some humor. 
I'll see my self out. Bye.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:42:17
That's an understandable feeling, but it's emotional reasoning. If people believe in the fundamentals then a price drop is an opportunity to buy more. If not, then why put money in it in the first place.

Such information serves as a solid reminder to be careful. A Bitcoin website/company/service can fold at anytime.
Also note that this was omitted from local media.
