@_date: 2017-12-25 00:53:22
This is entirely too confusing for the normal person. I tried to transfer $100 worth of btc to my bittrex account and didn't get an option for fees. It just told me I'd be charged about 35 dollars worth of btc foe the transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:04:33
If I'm on GDAX and sell some btc and get money in my USD account, is that considered gains even though I have not yet technically cashed out into my bank account? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:51:00
Coinbase to Bittrex. Not sure why I got down voted, this is a real issue. I'm btc 4life,not bcrap. Just stating facts.

And how would those roads you drive on be built without taxes? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:42:46
I did. I bought before 13k and love seeing the gains already

Oh, so wait, Medved costs money after the first month - 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:19:49
I'll look into that but will avoid going the bcash route unless it's utterly necessary. I really just wanted a proper way to get my coin to bittrex to pick up some ripple
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:24:56
Did you panic when it dropped to 11,400 after that? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:17:27
When it's 1270?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:44
Yeah, I know volume goes ape shit, but when it crashes for most, others seem to be able to sell down and drop the price. Weird for sure
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:38:21
Oh I understand that, but if it were to happen, would someone else have your wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:31:16
Why not both? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:36:21
Yeah - and Coinbase to Coinbase accounts should be free as well.  It's on their FAQ.  However,  I have several transactions between my buddy and I where I sent him x btc and he receives the btc I sent, however my outgoing btc is higher, the cost of the fee they said they'd waive.  He sent me some BTC as well and the same thing from his end.  Weird as hell.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:17:21
Ok, cool. Thanks for the info. Another question, with this be a single type line item in my taxes (loss or profit) or will each and every transaction need its own form? I've done a bunch of alt trading from coin to coin, lost a few bucks with stupid trades, now got most in just btc but had sold and rebought a few times. It'd be quite the pain in the ass if each transaction had to be documented on taxes separately 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:26:12
Yep. There it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:33:33
And..... Its down
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:04:34
My buddy and I just realized we're still getting charged the fee on Coinbase to Coinbase transfers. I've sent them a message but no response.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:28:11
One wall down, one to go. Almost there boys. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:48:01
Two things I've noticed (and I'm no expert)
1,thats just an even number and a shit load of people are selling small amounts, in addition to the big dogs trying to keep the price below 20k so they can buy more before it skyrockets.
2, computers are doing a lot of the trading. Those walls jump around so fast, it can't only be humans doing it. It could be there for visual threat alone. Once the value approaches that number, the walls shift in or out depending on what the wall holders are trying to do to the market. Sometimes the wall is there and then taken away entirely and the price soars (or drops) to the moon
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:48:32
Kinda like GDAX today
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:27
This was way more coordinated than that. These were sudden drops that occurred in minutes   we  were going up and down 6% value in seconds. This wasn't a panic sell situation. This was planned. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:33:53
Great stuff
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:03:59
This is not a trustworthy or good guy.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:34:12
Why 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:15:48
What if somehow someone else used the same seeds? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:37:41
What a perfect time to have a technical problem. Just so happens it coincides directly with a massive insider trading scandal.

Say I want to get I to mining or learn the lingo you all use for block chain technology, where do I begin? There seems to be so much detail, as a newcomer it's hard to focus

I wonder what it feels like to be someone with 1000 coins... Watching this shit

when you sign up to the exchange like Coinbase, you link a bank account to deposit money.  You use that same bank account to transfer BTC to your bankaccount and it converts the USD amt for you.  Keep in mind, there are transaction fees for this - so Coinbase and others can make $$$ in the process.  If you are familiar with online banking and bill pay, this isn't much more complicated than that really.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:12:56
I Xferred BTC from my Coinbase to GDAX account and it shows as completed in CB and nothing in GDAX - been an hour. A bit concerned.

Decisions are always better made in hindsight. No one here should tell you yes or no to do this... You gotta commit or retreat on your own. If you are confident in the currency, put in what you'd be willing to lose entirely.
Here's the thing... Regulators, governments, etc. They will want to make bitcoin useless. There will be challenges, dips, and possibly large slides. I was looking at the insanely massive pay wall that's just above 10k.itll be hard to stay above 10k for a little bit due to the pay wall. People will sell like crazy at that point. Others will help it recover if it dips.
There are all sorts of factors in play that could cause it to crash, but not many people thought we'd be looking at 10k today. One guy is about to eat his own testicle for God's sakes.
If 5k is something you're willing to risk, 20k,etc...but remember, if you lose it, it's gone. If you double it quickly, would you want to pull it and run, or keep it in and hodl.  I like risks and am willing to commit what I can, but I'd never put my family or future in serious jeopardy on such an unknown. Then there's the guy who took a mortgage out on his house and he's worth a few million now.

Right now on coinbase if I want to buy bitcoin it is over 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:42:19
Wow. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:52
I dunno - but I am very skeptical that there wasn't a reason for it.  During that same time, BTC went from 11.4k to 8k and back up to 10k.  It's been crazy all day.  Fidelity.com also is having major login issues.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:45:59
a few people with lots of BTC just did a quick cash out or something - drove the price down - now it's already correcting 5 minutes later, back to a steady 10700.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:41:43
You know the drill. You should have purchased some coin when you set up that reminder. It's already up to 10031
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:01:36
There was a quick dip a few weeks ago when it dropped to 5k for a day. Should have gotten some then - but should have also gotten some this morning at 9k - or right now at 10.5k - get a little, taste it and grow. (if you can take the risk)
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:48:49
Edit: 10090!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:31:18
The one fear is how the government regulations will impact  your bitcoin spending.  For example, every time you trade BTC for say, a loaf of bread, you've gained value in that BTC and the government wants their piece.  For now, its pretty vague and ambiguous, but be careful and aware in your country of how the laws are formed. It is inevitable.
