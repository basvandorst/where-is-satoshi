@_date: 2017-12-01 03:53:55
every euro country that took hell during 2008 should be 100% on board with the limited shenanigans of bitcoin.  keep listening to the well rewarded corporate shills like stiglitz and we are all headed towards zimbawe million dollar bills.

@_date: 2019-06-12 19:49:55
I think what trump is saying is a veiled anti bitcoin tweet.  What makes you think he of all people is gonna be pro bitcoin if he doesnt have a ton?
@_date: 2019-02-27 04:07:46

@_date: 2019-02-20 21:02:41

@_date: 2017-11-27 00:56:45
also keep in mind, when you see these 'pro' analysts make price targets they are always going to come in low bc they dont want to blow mom and pop's minds with crazy gain % numbers and put the financial adviser racket out of business with their 3% a year gain hype.  somebody's house might get burned down.
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:46:42
Why do you think he comes off so robotic nowdays?  Trying to keep his true nature suppressed isnt easy.
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:16:49
You overestimate the non tech public.
@_date: 2019-04-16 21:38:33
GOT DAMMIT THIS THIS THIS.  Why is everybody acting like this is a first and why didnt binance nip it in the bud?
@_date: 2019-12-14 06:56:04
Chinese miners are attempting to pervert bitcoin just like drug dealers perverted Spanish Fly (ndma).

The world economy is what it is.  They can produce factory goods for cheap elsewhere.  He probably though oh well lets just put the blacks in the factories.  Typical.

Clickbait salad.

Walking out your door in the morning to go to work is a risk too.  And yet...
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:16:22
Whats the difference between wright and roger ver?  Bc wright claims to be satoshi?  That's stupid.
@_date: 2019-04-30 19:24:01
Bull run no time soon with these article titles...
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:26:05
Will the btc halving also apply to sidechains like btg btd btcsv etc?
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:34:46
Roger ver said bch is the true btc.  On and on and wanted to fight everybody about it.  I dont see the diff.
@_date: 2019-04-16 03:16:53
Maybe, but just to point out Ver DID try to sell everyone on BCH being the real bitcoin through various marketing attempts and where do you think the phrase "satoshis vision" even came from?  Ver. When he was trolling for BCH.

Alaska has no bitcoiners TIL.
@_date: 2019-09-16 23:46:17
This is why its hilarious that out of all the top world financial orgs that jp morgan, the original robber scammer, calls bitcoin a scam.
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:54:48
Short to zero.
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:10:05
They are gonna fuck this up like they fucked up draftkings lol.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:06:51
Yeah reading this kind of clarifies that satoshi was some kind of codename for a nsa/cia black op.  I mean wtf does some japanese programmer get bent out of shape over wikileaks which mainly attacks the west and not asia?  That carefully loaded plea to stand down, etc.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:28:56

Trades are fast.  Transfers not as much.
@_date: 2019-05-02 05:15:32
They ran tv and radio ads for draftkings and fanduel almost every other commercial for about a month and people got so sick of them that states started banning the sites and killed all the momentum they had built to that point.

Not the same thing at all.  The article clearly says consumer records were stolen not cash from accounts.
