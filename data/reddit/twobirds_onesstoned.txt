Watch the people. Bitcoin reacts to the sociology of it's users and potential users. In a way, predictive bulls actually lead the market. People follow the advice of bulls they trust so predictions are more like threads of possibility that people fulfil by attempting to take advantage. They never last, every peak I've ever seen is post big news from a powerful source. People pay up for the potential value, increasing the current value. Then when they realise the value is artificial as it is only the demand they create by attempting to beat demand and it slows to a crawl as people struggle to sell and drops again.
It was a good way to get a max consumer specs gaming PC for 200 in a year just before the price of hardware increased thabks to mining and bitcoin value dropped. In a way I got an extra 200 on top as my GPU value went up from 750 to 950 for several months after purchase.

It's absolutely going to rally between December and February. Probably start climbing late November. It will crash back though by March. Not as big as last year, but it will happen I'm sure. I'm not expert but my gut told me to pull out after a year of watching it and the media surrounding it and it peaked and dropped within 24 hours of me pulling out. Haven't come back since, but I'm tempted to buy within the next month and find a stable crypto to trade into at the peak before the inevitable crash.

Much like the legal psychoactives market, banks and countries banning it will only drive it underground ar a higher price. And reporting on it will increase the desire and knowledge for it. Cautiously doesn't make spikes. When the number of people googling how to buy bitcoin with paypal or credit card or just online or how to get free bitcoin increases and people start buying in with no clue of what's happening, they will be taken advantage of inadvertantly.

My missus seemed annoyed when I spent money on crypto.
She seemed even more annoyed when I multiplied my investment x10 in a year.
Even more annoyed when I spent it all on myself because I asked if she wanted to invest any of her money and she said no.
Watched me gamble my money for a year and got annoyed at me constantly to then want a piece of the pie. Nah. She should've invested in the first place.

I do. But poker players don't just win on the luck of the draw. There is strategy. And often it lies outside of the probabilities and numbers, like readibg the players. Same rules apply. The element of luck doesn't negate a successful strategy. I was lucky in that I chose a way to make my prediction and it paid off. I'll continue to test my system and if it fails I'll be back here much more humble.
Also I wasn't entirely accurate. I thought it would pick up more speed and peak higher and I was ~24 hours off. Then as he climb came I reacted. It went about as high as I thought, a little lower and took a day longer. The pattern was spot on, the scale was slightly off.
Of course I'll be back to eat my words if my next investment goes badly.

Like I said in the other comment in this thread, I kept track of a lot of factors which influence the value. What I did worked. Call it luck if you want, but I put in about 10-20 hours a week for a year just analysing. Why does doing well imply luck but doing badly imply being good?
Obviously it's Bitcoin's fault for not somehow bending to suit the "good" strategies. Damn cryptos, not knowing how they should act.

Just saying, I totally saw it coming and sold the day before the peak. Tried to get family to invest for a few months but they didn't believe me or thought it was too risky.

Oooh boy. A few more posts like this and it's time for a price jump.

... So why didn't I sell when it started dropping? Well because it was worth less then. I sold before the peak hit and dropped by 24 hours and knew it wouldn't rise again. It would've been harder to get a good rate as the crash was happening. That's why the price dipped. People had to go lower to sell it as the market speed hit critical mass and there were tons of delays in the network and exchanges.
I'm pretty sure I understand the system. Which is why I got out within 24 hours of it peaking and dropping because it was unsustainable and was one of the people creating the peak which theb had to drop as the artificial nature of it's current value became apparent contributing to the fall.
I guess I could've risked 400-500 over a possible $80 gain. But I figured I'd stay ahead of the curve. And unfortunately for many, the ones who bought high and lost out have the coins people with my strategy sold.
I also spent it on computer hardware that jumped in value a few days after purchase. Wouldn't have had time to do that also. So got an extra $300-500 in the value of my hardware.
I've still got time to buy. No point sitting on a stable coin all year.
All I know is I bought in Feb and guessed in June that I should pull out mid-December based on sociological factors and it paid off and had I followed the masses, I'd be as sorry as many of them are. I only played with 0.2BTC. Didn't have the funds to put back in and I wanted the PC. I know I'm gonna regret not keeping the cash in the next 6 months.

Spread of news and unique audience progression, search analytics of new users with little knowledge asking how to buy bitcoin with paypal or credit card, uptick of YouTube exposure and content production, increase of scam operations and malware centred around bitcoin, political discussions and legislation propositions, availability of darknet contraband, sales figures of mining hardware and available computing stock, celebrity exposure and public opinion.
The people control the value. The people aren't always in control. That's why it's been modelled similarly to bacterial growth. The process is organic.
