Sounds good in theory, but the fees show that it isn't capable of being the world currency it sought out to be. Not without adopting LN and becoming centralized, that is. Such is why other cryptocurrencies keeping with the goal of staying decentralized are moving away from proof of work. The value of Bitcoin came from  it's ability to complete transactions on-chain, decentralizes. Bitcoin no longer is capable of doing that within reason.

Don't you see? You just have to modify the white paper. Replace "decentralized" with ~~centralized~~ lightning network and you're golden!

If by well-crafted, you mean an overly complex solution with more problems than solutions to the major scaling issues Bitcoin faces, you're correct. Don't get me wrong, SegWit is decent as a first attempt. Lightning Network, and the seemingly acceptance of it's implementation by the (moderator's  cherry picked comments of the...) community convinced me to sell.
Has anyone read the Bitcoin white paper?? It shouldn't be a fucking store of value. It's value is derived from it's solution to a relative societal issue: all digital payments go through a third party. These companies take a cut to survive and feast on the merchants. Bitcoin is community focused. The community now wishes to adopt lightning network, effectively adding a third party into transactions, recreating the issue Bitcoin originally attempted to solve. 
I sold all my bjtcoin a while ago. I now own zero BTC and zero BCH. I have nothing at stake while the two will inevitably battle it out. Both have faults, however, one's value is derived from fundamental attributes the community has abandoned.

It only takes two brain cells to scream "increase the fucking block size". You can tell the non-informed you can buy fractions of a Bitcoin, but when it costs $35 to purchase $10 value of BTC, clearly something is broken.

Are there any other reputable exchanges available in WA? I gave up trying months ago.

SegWit ��is��trash��. Why do you want that??
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:59:01
The problem with Bitcoin is how it's success was handled. God forbid lightning network ever isn't just vaporware.

You're not wrong. That's exactly what occurred during the dotcom bubble. Everything lost its value. Pets.com dropped until they were no longer. Amazon dropped from around $50 to $7. Pets.com is still no longer around, amazon is trading above $1k/share.
Amazon was innovative and superior over it's competition. I don't see Bitcoin being the Amazon of the crypto bubble. If anything, failure to innovate, separation from it's original goals (lighting network would make Satoshi absolutely appalled), lack of competent developer cohesiveness, lack of community adhesiveness for the exception of the community completely blinded by choice-supportive bias, the sudden rush of first time investors who have done zero research, people taking out money they don't even have to purchase Bitcoin. You can literally buy crypto on margin, now. Not just Bitcoin, any crypto. For those unaware, buying stocks on margin (ie with a credit card) was one of the larger causes of the great depression. 
A downfall is inevitable. However, eventually, many will fail to recover. A few will rise from the ashes and become greater than the entire current crypto market cap by orders of magnitude, but that isn't Bitcoin. High fees, not Bitcoin cash, caused the crash. New money influx into BTC caused the network to be unusable, and once everyone realized the current system doesn't work (sending $10 of BTC for $35 for example), everyone is trying to GTFO. 
The worst part is that everyone in the communities say they are in it for the technology. Yet, these are the same people promoting SegWit and god forbid, lightning network. These people took a technology, and anyone supporting lightning network wishes to decentralize Bitcoin. They want to go against the very fundamentals of which Bitcoin was created. 
I have zero long term faith in BTC or BTH because of these people. You can't blame BTH when that's an obvious creation/response to what the community allowed. BCH isn't new, it was just simply called Bitcoin last year. Bitcoin is new. Again, I have zero faith in either, although, my faith is in Ether.

The stickied post on this sub is titled "please invest responsibly". You're familiar with the phrase "don't invest more than you can afford to lose". It sounds like you got greedy/stupid and did the opposite.

Exactly! They should be nonpartisan and give users the opportunity to purchase both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core!
Oh wait, aren't we mad about that?

Litecoin is a slightly improved version. And then it's creator said fuck it and cashed out yesterday. If that isn't concerning, and it should be, to any crypto, then I don't think anyone here is capable of uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:54:23
Certain other alts have realistic scaling plans that don't rely on adoption nor do they create a decentralized power, as lightning network would do, god forbid  that ever becomes  commonplace. Certain other alts go above and beyond to serve as far more than a currency. I get it, there is a problem. All digital transactions go through a third party like Visa. The solution is clearly not Bitcoin with these fucking fees. Introducing a third party, or lightning network is not a solution either. 
Bitcoin is to the crypto bubble that pets.com was to the dotcom bubble. I'm not sure who will be the Amazon.com, but in no way will it be btc.

Fucking this. Both communities need to grow the fuck up. Both BCH and BTC took different routes from the original chain. BCH is intentionally misleading on occasion, but BTC is too ever since Blockstream took over.

r/btc was created to be this sub without moderator overreach back when BCH wasn't a thing.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:51:07
Wouldn't that be inflation at a declining rate? Without increased adoption, the value would decline at a decreasing rate.
@_date: 2018-05-06 03:59:34
Bitcoin and BCH are coins. Don't use the dictionary definition of "token", as it isn't relevant in this situation. That'd be like someone saying Bitcoin isn't a coin, it's a digital currency.
In the crypto space, a coin is it's own block chain. A token runs on an established block chain. Perhaps you should both resist segregating the crypto community until you've done your research on the fucking basics.

Get outta here with that tumblr garbage. If you're implying someone is wrong, or if you're making a claim, the burden of proof is on you. You know that, but you also know your argument must be weak as fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:16:57
As someone who currently has neither had BTC or bch, it certainly seems as though this sub is the salty one, especially the moderators, and the users calling the last Bitcoin price drop an "attack", tearing down posters, etc.
