You bought at the top of the hype-cycle. Just wait for the next one, might take 2 or 3 years though.

There is only consencus on CO2 being a greenhouse gas. There is no consencus on what the exact effect is of our CO2 emissions. 
The alarmist models have been proven wrong time and time again. And when reality doesn't follow the models, the arrogant scientists say that there was a global warming hiatus (2000-2015). That's not how you do science.

Networks grow following Metcalfe's Law, so the price will keep on increasing as it has done in previous years. It's the hype-cycles that confuse people because the price skyrockets and then comes crashing down. But for the long run things are going just fine. Just hodl.

You're not answering my question.
And I'd rather have exit scams with relatively small shitcoins, than the entire worldwide financial system collapsing.

The dollar is also backed by criminals that almost made sure the entire worldwide financial system collapsed and none of these assholes went to jail.

So if the financial system collapses, the entire world can just shift to cash and we can all continue as before?
Companies will have enough cash to pay the wages of all their employees for months and years to come? Companies can still function without the current financial system? A producer in the West of the country will just send a parcel of cash by mail to a supplier in the East of the country?
You really think that's how the world would work if the financial system collapses?

No value at all.... Another person that has forgotten about the 2008 crisis. You do know that the global financial system almost collapsed back then right? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:56:51
You're full of great arguments, aren't you? 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:40:55
Yes I do, but apparently this "backed" system can still be at risk of failing since 10 years ago this backed centralized system almost failed.
I prefer a decentralized system, since it's a lot safer. It's pretty apparent that the 2008 crisis has proven this.

A while back there was someone who started a thread and confessed he had been part of a paid team of shills.

You don't care that the worldwide financial system almost collapsed 10 years ago? You're fine with that?

Tell that to the people in Venezuela who have more trust in crypto currency than their worthless hyper-inflated local currency.
And there's plenty of countries in the world where monetary policy is far worse than in the West. Cryptocurrencies hold the biggest promise in the developing world. 
This has nothing to do with crypto being a ponzi scheme.

Metcalfe's law will ensure that Bitcoin's price will rise more and more in the years to come. 
I think a new hype-cycle is still 2 to 3 years away and then we will probably see prices above 100.000 dollars.

Bitcoin at the very least is a safety net. How much of a safety net depends on the level of adoption. If the financial system collapses tomorrow, Bitcoin's role in the chaos afterwards will be minimal.
In the future when adoption is higher, Bitcoin can definitely help to pick up the pieces if the old system collapses. Just because it's decentralized and people can control their own Bitcoin.

If you just hold, then yes.

Ask your dad why the global financial system almost collapsed in 2008 and what was done to prevent this from ever happening again.
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:00:39
There is only consensus on CO2 being a greenhouse gas! There are different climate models, ones with more conservative outcomes and one with alarming outcomes.
There is no consensus on what the exact effects of CO2 are! This is a fact. It's a FACT that there are different models!
The problem is that the subject has been politized and that's why people are thinking there is consensus on the alarmism.

If the old system would have collapsed, you and I would not have been able to do any payments. We would not have been able to get to our money.
With cryptocurrency you don't have this issue. If all the banks fail, you and I can still do payments.
It's pretty obvious which system is the better and safer system: the decentralized one.
