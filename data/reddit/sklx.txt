That really depends on how you define a crash. Bitcoin crashed and spiked multiple times since December, most of the time crashing to a lower point.

They aren't ignoring simple economics. They're just stating that cryptocurrency is currently detrimental to their hobby. Is it irrational for them to wish that the crypto market would crash?
The comparison make no sense. There hasn't been an order of magnitude spike in demand for Bugattis. They've always been expensive.

Around 200 depending on which organization you ask.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:57:49
Do you have literally any reasoning for that besides your gut feeling? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:52:46
Not a fair comparisson. 
1k drop from 20k is 5%, 1k drop from 6k is 16%. Think logarithmically

Better luck next time
