it will always be a thing how could you possibly think otherwise

Not really, in what way has this happened at all. Some coins are centralised as fuck. 
Are you going to loan a corporation $300million in bitcoins?

Its reddit. Top post is a girl attention whoring because she bought a dog.

Bitcoin versus Bcash is for noobies. All relevant exchanges use bitcoin and ethereum to buy cryptocurrencies. No one uses Bcash to buy shit, it is an alt overpromoted by scam artists. Fucking Craig Wright trying to claim hes satoshi, gtfo of here

this, so many altcoins are insanely undervalued because their product/s are a long way off delivery, and not many people can read 100's of white papers or even FAQ's to make any kind of FA at all. Bitcoin will breach 50k maybe 100k in 2018 but countless alts will increase their satoshi value multiple times on top of that.

don't be a homo and fuck your work over. You are screwing over all the other wageslaves who have to catch up on your stuff, you aren't sticking it to the man

The "developers" are precisely why I wont ever buy BCash. They all seem like sex tourists running a marketing scam from Thailand. Roger is an emotional idiot, you have millions of dollars, buy some chill man
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:23:24
they wont compete on technical merits, mostly marketing and brand awareness, which is why Roger is trying so damn hard

I want to retire from wage/salary work asap. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:35:43
literally all crypto currencies including bcash
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:46
everyone on Bittrex Binance and wherever else

its conditional on it going to 100k....

CNN is such a disaster

Was it a scam all along? Pure market manipulation? The cynic in me says yes....

Its pure fantasy that it will replace fiat in countries with a functioning government.
It will replace fiat in broken countries like it has in Zimbabwe and Venezuela

Crypto is still prone to manipulation in many forms as we saw last weekend. PnD, a DDos and crashed exchange for the majority of a region. At what stage do you think events like that become impossible? There will always be whales in some form or another and there will always be people screwing the market. Crypto whales will just have more real wealth in the future.

People do that with company stocks as well, its just more clearly defined as illegal. It does not make BTC a Ponzi scheme at its core, just that there is a lack of regulation about forks. I doubt there will be any soon, the focus will be on taxing and tracking laundering/criminal payments.

its a tough choice, the next dip could be from $7500 to $7000 again, or from $10500 to $10000...
