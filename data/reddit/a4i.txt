I disagree. The concept is different. Torrenting can give you illegal content directly. Bitcoin cant be illegal directly. Exchanging bitcoin for an illegal good can be done for anything of value.

If humans trading increased vastly, wouldn't it naturally arbitrage? I pick the cheapest exchange. Local bitcoins is incredibly slow and I'd only practical to perform complete buy sell for total amount desired rather than being it down. Also, the price on localbitcoins has a wider spread because of les supply and demand and people want profit for the effort involved in the transaction.

Edit: you assume a crash in dollars impacts all currencies? Usually they crash relative to the others. You are referring to a vast reduction in purchasing power. Extremely unlikely on a global scale across all currencies. Just compare your bitcoin to the number of big macs it can buy and it'll give you its purchasing power.

Puppy linux encrypts persistence (e.g. your armory wallets) out of the box and loads and runs faster. It only runs on RAM so nothing is preserved except for the encrypted persistence file. Unity is a terrible UI. I use armory in puppy linux, but it isn't the latest version.

Interesting, I'm learning a lot in this thread. I was thinking about a wireless technology with a much wider range than what is in typical WiFi routers doing 802.11. I didn't think it would be efficient, but rather it would be be populated with a lot of nodes so providing a lot of redundancy.

I'm just describing a way of accessing existing internet addresses from the new network. As the new network develops, people can transition to it. People could provide services via two addresses, existing IP address on the old network and the new network. It isn't 100% centralization if it depends on the old infrastructure since that could be via multiple access points. Thanks for clarifying binary blobs. The link this post refers to doesn't go into technical details but if they are really pushing FOSS, they could opt for a wifi or wireless technology that is available in code form (or written from scratch) so not reliant on binaries.
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:44:20
You sound like a troll. An aim of the network is to be robust - so alternative routes could be established for connectivity, exactly like the existing network. Regarding speed, that'll improve as the technology is developed but getting low datarates is a big step up from 0 bits per second.

Anyone with an internet connection and a connection to the new network could volunteer to provide access if their ISP permitted it (or didn't know about it). I'm referring to the kind of connection that would be like a VPN, which performs adequately. I didn't see anything with a google search that would explain what blobless means. As for supernodes, those interconnections can be classified or configured as being supernodes.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:28:25
They won't know. It could be tor traffic for all they know
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:37:33
In the USA? They wouldn't need to know. Universities and google at first. Outside the USA, there is probably less resistance in some countries and more in others. It could be possible to use the new open network to connect to my modem to use the internet from anywhere without needing a cellular connection but have security so I'm the only one able to use it. Anyway, I didn't say there wouldn't be barriers and opposition.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:59:43
Hacking in the 90s meant breaching network security. Other broader definitions came later.
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:42:14
Because the traffic won't look any different than if it originated from a device on the local network of the access point to the ISP. Or, it could go through a VPN so it is indistinguishable. Or it could go through TOR. All the ISP would notice is potentially an increase in network usage. And that could be throttled.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:48:13
I'd only heard of I2P. Thanks for sharing those, they are interesting. The only communication protocols I write code for are automotive and those are a lot simpler ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:14:12
Make the new network talk with the old network through certain access points.
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:24:36
I'm not specifying a protocol to use, just a concept. I hadn't heard of a BGP peering agreement until I read your comment. From a completely amateur &amp; ignorant perspective, lets say there is an internet 2.0 with wifi devices that all talk to each other and discover each other and some of them have a dual connection to the regular internet. They keep routing information and that information can keep track of nodes that the internet 2.0 connectivity. UDP and TCP requests can be transmitted from internet 2.0 nodes to go via the nodes that have the legacy internet connection.
