How much do you pay per kwH? In Germany you pay at least 30 cents...

No Monero on your list? Most underrated currency since 1 year

The ballance of Deutsche Bank shows that it's running out of steam at the end of next year. The Target 2 debts are mainly debts that southern countries own to Germany. They can never pay them back what brings further instability if banks are tumbling

The Deutsche Bank will lead the crisis in Q3. They have so much derivates in their portfolio with no value. This time it'll not only be a banking crisis. It's the first currency crisis since nearly 100 years that will be a problem for every country with debts in dollars. Countries that can print their own money like Japan will suffer through devaluation. European countries will split up in a norther Euro zone after Target 2 debts bring southern countries to fall.

Brilliant design... Shows people unfamiliar to cryptos that Satoshis can be a currency as well as a Dollar
@_date: 2019-03-23 19:22:36
Hodl as lo g as you can and sell it only if really necessary... The algorithm is on your side and inflation burns your fiat currency to zero
@_date: 2019-11-20 15:56:24
Take a look at coinmap.org  There are plenty of possibilities
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:57:12
Yes, than it's definitifely worth mining. Have  fun and grats to your private mining station

All the best from the bavarian highlands
We are close to the czech and austrian border. It's definitely worth to plan a trip to Prague and Vienna if you haven't been there��
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:19:59
Hi, of course you can send via coingate. Happy to see you here in the highlands��
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:20:59
Enjoy hiking, biking or skiing in a scenic landscape! 
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:12:14
Let me know earlier if you're in this region that i can make a reservation for you, ok. Have a nice holiday and all the best��
@_date: 2019-11-10 13:59:47
1 or 2 quarter years sooner or later could be possible. In Q3 German banks will get problems. In Q4 after the election of Trump the war with Iran gets green light for sure. That's the last big war the U. S. will fight for the next 2 decades... Unpossible to win as the wars before and a pot of 2 trillions of costs for nothing...
@_date: 2018-10-04 21:00:19
Hi, we are completely booked until the end of February. Minimum nights to stay is 5. We are a very small business doing it real family styled so we can't offer to stay for a night or 2.
If you enjoy ski sliding or skiing the beginning of March is the best time. 1,5 meters of snow and perfect conditions
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:02:14
Try coinbase
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:10:53
Nope, that was just an advice... You can buy btc immediately with a credit card
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:45:35
Hi. We take Bitcoin, Ethereum or Monero. Copay, coinbase, coinomi and different more wallets are in use��
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:01:14
The 3 or 4 big wallets are owned by exchanges. That's ok and necessary, but 2 %of the wallets own 82 % of all btc... Similar to the real world where more and more dollars belong to just a few... As everybody knows... This causes chaos and greed...
But why sould new money move to Bitcoin dew to the fact thst it's not necessary as a currency in the real world.
You can also hedge with real estate, precious metals...against the dollar and it's sinking importance in the future
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:20:04
You're right and that should make you think about the dollar as a world reserve currency in the bags of the countries in the emerging markets. They collapse cause they aren't independent from the dollar...
It's the same with bitcoin. Who is willing to get new in the market to just fulfill the rule "buy our money"?
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:22:21
Cash out and buy a real Btc at a coming dip and store it on a Ledger Nano S. Wait for a few years and stay calm. Next years financial crisis will show you did everything right��
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:32:00
That's true.... In Germany every newspaper only reports about btc 10% down.... 10 to 20% up....? No single word
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:48:26
As we would say in Bavaria "Droddl"
@_date: 2019-06-23 11:55:16
No, the beginning of a bull market
@_date: 2019-02-13 14:57:10
The same as in Fiat currencies��
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:16:27
How should it go to zero? Just think about someone offering you an ounce of Gold for 5 Dollars? Would you say no cause it's only shiny yellow metal? Sure not. 
It's the same with Btc... A brilliant save method to store value and a possibility to send money by the way... 
@_date: 2019-02-21 11:01:30
See it move to 3850 and then to Fibonacci at 0.382....means 4400 until the end of march
@_date: 2019-02-14 09:59:59
As in every asset category everything is build on algorithms, so as here. Believe me... We are at a very early stage and this is the only way to find out halfway a correct price for a product...
Most assets are traded in milliseconds on algorithm. Thats why markets crash in just minutes...
I expect Btc to fall to 2550 to 2800 before we see it rise again.
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:26:01
BTC / ETH / XMR / IOTA / ADA
@_date: 2019-02-15 05:46:26
No country in the western world would be so stupid to make cryptos illegal. Their price would explode and it would follow a Darkweb boom that's even harder to control than watches legal usage

Hi, buy 5 oz of Gold and put the rest in Bitcoin. Just forget about it the next years and sell it if you need to
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:24:05
One circle is 4 years normally. This should lead us to the top at the end of 2022, so calm down and be patient
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:36:39
In 3 years we could see 100k...it depends also what will happen with all the QE programs of central banks around the world. The more they print the more they pump the stock market. That's not good for Btc, but if the bubble bursts we will see many people flee into Bitcoin and gold. People in BRIC states will be forced to move into Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:31:27
No, 20k will be in game at the beginning of 2022....still a good investment if someone buys today
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:26:41
You can mine one Btc in Venezuela for 530 $ or in Ukraine or Belarus for about 1800 $... There are always good places to make enough profit by mining...
@_date: 2019-04-17 17:57:53
I can say for sure. It's not my wallets
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:58:38
Buy some, spend 100 bucks in btc and buy btc for 100 bucks again.... Do it like this all the time
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:22:29
Nice to see czech Republic so open to new and innovative things. In 10 to 15 years we will talk about the prime countries in crypto that helped out to start a new future in finance. Austria and Switzerland are superactive too!
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:06:53
I miss ads like this everywhere. This is how the public gets into it.... Especially in Latin america and Africa it would be useful.... 
@_date: 2018-11-14 12:32:11
About 1000 people own 40% of all the money that's around...wonder why you're not one of these 1000's?
@_date: 2019-01-04 13:12:22
You can buy hard wallets, merchandise, cryptos (btc and altcoins) there. You can buy it on atm's. It's a nice shop with superfriendly owners that love to help out everybody answering their question.... Good luck bitcoin store��
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:19:23
Is it like this, that you can create a "lightning wallet" with a regular btc transaction? All the money in this wallet is free to spend in the LN without permission of the nodes? That would be fine i think
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:22:13
True, i just don't understand how government (also like here in Germany) can be so much against innovation. They should see it as a chance of technical progress. It's unstoppable, and the first countries that adopt the tech at every sector (finance, trading, health care, production....) will be the future leaders
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:07:38
Adoption is still 5 to 10 years away. The price of every asset is manipulated. Take gold... 2 times a day 5 persons are making a phone call to talk about the price of the day. Coffee...a big buyer in Hamburg buys so 45 % of the worlds coffee just to make it rare and sell it if prices rise cause there is a "lack in the coffeemarket"... Same with stocks.... Really everything... The whole thing is to keep it long. So you don't have to care about swings...
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:03:05
The Dollar doesn't have to compete with Crypto. It competes with other fiat currencies. The Renmimbi will replace the Dollar in the next 20 years anyway. Many countries try to get rid of the Dollar dominance and buy gold...and other currencies
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:43:51
Hey, you still have enough time to buy in. We are still very low and early. Just buy a bit every week and Hodl. That's the best choice. In the longterm you'll be happy��
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:15:37
Me and many of my friends hodl. We play the game the long way to keep btc rare and safe it like gold bars. Hodling could keep the prices more stable and make it attractive to more scary people that look for longterm investments
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:18:59
Please wait... There will be a drop for sure.... I'm sure we will see 5200
@_date: 2019-05-25 20:27:31
Ask him to move just 1 btc from "his" 1 million btc wallet to prove he is SN...if he really can you can bet on falling prices...
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:40:16
4k...? I don't think we'll see that ever again. The next thing is that the leverage inversion will send us into a recession. Precious metals and for the first time bitcoin will take profit in the next crisis. It's way to much printed money out there and the derivates market is going to explode soon
@_date: 2019-05-05 08:37:54
2 scammers in one room. Making profit out of people working for them. Hard labour has to be done to make these 2 unproductive old man rich.
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:53:10
Thanks i wish you luck too. There are only a few rules i follow. Never trust a bankster, invest only in things you understand, never invest in things that a company guy told you to do.
The next financial crisis is hitting us 2019/2020...buy gold and silver and keep money left for the time after the crash to go back into stocks
