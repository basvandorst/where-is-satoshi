I think 36% off is a more reasonable price :)

The code could be MtFinexDAO.

Poloniex is a liar that state they will adopt winning chain. And it's polo that caused such a disaster.

If TREZOR support ethereum some day will it be required to buy a new one or just update firmware to use eth wallet?
@_date: 2016-08-31 17:26:13
Thanks for your great works. I can't wait to use ethereum wallet.

If it is with Satoshi's private key I would buy it.

I can tell you one must success strategy. That is "buy low and sell high"

Did anyone ever wonder why core considered double block size as evil as being like it will cause the end of the world? Is it really so bad such that they would like to take the risk of splitting chain than just increase merely double block size.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:59:53
I doubt that, you core fans

If this is crazy, how about FED printed 60 billion USD out of air per month.

Will it be possible that bitcoin itself cause a global financial crisis?

I wonder if running a LN hub is profitable. For example, I open payment channel with payment hub and lock, says 1BTC, in the channel. I wish I can received BTC so counterpart should lock 1BTC in the channel as well. This means payment hub have to prepare 100 BTC if hub has 100 customers. It makes no sense to lock so much funds for 6 to 12 months just for customers daily transaction. 
If you think network topology will be built by real P2P without big payment hub involved, then how many payment channels I have to open in order to ensure that I can pay to any node in LN.

Decentralization is great, but user running full node is no loner meaningful since the mining become centralized. Full nodes running by miner, exchange, wallet corporate, big merchant are those really important. These nodes keep some sort of decentralization already. I really like to know what will happen to bitcoin ecosystem if all full nodes running by normal user disconnected instantly.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:06:20
You got it . Funds locked in LN cannot be cold wallet, especially when you use it to receive funds.

My brain wallet was fail to restore from v2.0. I found it add a restriction to force length of passpharse to be 32. If you created branwallet using arbitrary  passpharse in hex format , you have to use previous version to restore your wallet.

I worried about the size of bitcoin blockchain will become huge since every transaction occurring in exchange will now all be recorded to blockchain.

We need another financial crisis to teach them what the bitcoin is.

People who deposit more than 2000 dollars will benefit from this change.
