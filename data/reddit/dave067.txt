btctrip is quite expensive, but cheapair it's on the same prices provided by other sites :)

I see gpus on the preview
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:47:28
Lol, can relate highly to this, but i can also relate to customs transaction fees ;)
@_date: 2018-09-01 21:46:32
You talk about btc and mention gpus which aren't used for btc mining, s9 price is wrong, now you can have them for 650 usd.
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:10:04
Also kraken offers OTC services
@_date: 2015-12-25 11:53:30
it's clearly written on their site, you're free to check it out
also not everyone it's a us citizen you know...
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:38:03
Have you tried to pay through expedia.us?
In other versions the bitcoin payment option doesn't even appear
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:28:43
I do suggest you to use bitcoin suisse, aml/kyc compliant, fast service, they do not report transactions to anyone
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:34:46
I lol'd :D
@_date: 2014-05-25 00:06:26
We haven't found one yet that's able to use 3d technology
@_date: 2014-09-03 15:47:50
bleah, ridicolusly overpriced
@_date: 2014-05-19 10:23:58
Nice idea, working on it
Let's see the real power of the bitcoin community
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:28:07
Sorry but the 3d player is working only for windows and mac
@_date: 2014-05-24 09:15:49
You must have unity 3d web player to see the embassy
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:04:04
less than a skyhook atm, since it's an unpleasant big chunk of metal with a couple of lcd screens and a note accepter
@_date: 2014-05-25 09:41:11
Thank you for the idea, we will take a look on it
@_date: 2014-05-24 09:16:17
Answered in reddit, you must install unity 3d web player
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:13:17
You should try tghabogados.com, law firm based in panama, they offer all these kind of services and they accept bitcoins
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:39:31
A common mobile phone in those days costs way more than a trezor
@_date: 2016-03-24 10:08:23
Next time i suggest you trying to book using cheapair, they offer both hotels and flights booking, i used them instead of expedia and can't regret it
They also know how to handle btc refunds!
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:11:17
FATCA, applies to banks usually
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:10:56
as already said just use bitwala, you can send sepa transfers to anyone, 1 percent fee, you just need to verify yourself, otherwise the first level just allow you to send up to 500 euros
The second one is up to 2000, but you have to submit an id, and a statement to confirm your residential address
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:39:54
You deserve a cookie :)
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:54:02
nope, all cfd shit
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:53:59
we know what the real deal is
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:26:30
they still accept them though
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:45:54
on the next episode, kale seats!
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:32:54
oh my gawd, they do really exist, white vegan leather seats???
@_date: 2017-04-01 14:52:48
Real experts support segwit, that's how you do it, high five bitcoin bros!
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:24:37
They're safer than online wallets for sure
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:42:10
yeah, or if you lose the seed and device in a house fire if you don't have any copy, otherwise it just sits in the blockchain untouched
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:25:02
quite difficult, as long as you check the addresses you should be good
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:23:58
welll, ledger received something like 70 mln in funding but still not compromised, and they wouldn't gain something from hacking, money is in the long run, not in stealing client funds. Got some trust in the trezor creator and his pool :)
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:30:23
exactly thaaaat
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:31:37
a copy or more in different locations, charlie shrem has a ring with part of his private key on it, remembers the other part.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:25:28
same :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:24:13
seconded, you buy an hardware wallet and simply don't give a fuck about hackers :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:08:48
Or everybody could just use an hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:47:18
If you're level 2 verified you're ok until you reach 2000 euros per month not more
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:37:11
Pm sent
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:04:26
maybe you've got to send the documents again for the cards?
anyway their support is quite good, they will probably answer today
