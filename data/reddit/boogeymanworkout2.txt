Why is there a maximum? Why isn't a country allowed to insure their citizens better?

Stay calm and carry on.

Microsoft doesn't support xp. Do you expect others to?
@_date: 2015-12-28 05:42:54
Shh. The mods don't allow it. They'll ban me if I say too much.

There are other subreddits where you can discuss 0-conf. Not here though.

Let's encrypt is free for all sites.

If he can do that, you've got bigger problems. And the certificates have short life spans, so he won't have it for long. Let's encrypt could even revoke certificates if requested to keep it further down.
If someone hacked your server with a regular ssl cert, it would be worse.

Are they a large percentage of your visitors? What kind of site is this?
I'm sure your site is not the only thing that doesn't work for them though.

I've heard of agreeing to disagree, but disagreeing to agree is somehow a really strange concept. Go home. You're drunk.

Exactly. Just like how blockstream is insisting so much on low block sizes, that there are starting to pop up new clients (recently bitpay), to give new options the market wants. It's truly power to the people.

I think this is where this thread went wrong. He asked about the coordination and insurance since we're comparing it to uber and airbnb. I don't see any negativity in that. Asking into it is not negative. You interpreted that somehow.
But i personally like the idea that it could compete with them. This might be really cool. Disrupting those markets even further. Although it's important that we notice these potential issues, just like we should notice the differences between uber and "old fashioned" cabs or bitcoin and fiat. We might find some interesting solutions to this.

Does Netflix and chill go to another level, when using bitcoin? Ding - you're a daddy.

Well it works on this one too.

If you're in a place that charges capital gains taxes on bitcoins, can you also deduct losses?

I just wanted to see how it worked. But I realized I needed the password to my account, which I don't have cause I created it as a throwaway account. I might have to create another account.

You don't think bitcoin should be used for retail then?
@_date: 2015-11-03 06:45:39
RemindMe! 1 year "Does ₿ look like a bitcoin symbol yet?"
@_date: 2015-11-22 01:01:00
Well that should technically be a new investment (in bitcoins) if you're taxed on capital gains/losses.

Instead of warning people every time there's a new scam, wouldn't it be better to teach people how to tell the difference?
There are constantly scams going on. If people warned me every time I got spam, I'd have double the noise (if it wasn't for the spam filter).
Not everything gets caught in the spam filter and not everybody knows how to tell the difference. So educating them is great. But make sure to do that. Otherwise you're just saying don't trust emails from blockchain for a while.

It's the same kind of nonsense as when people notice random patterns in elections or sports. Xkcd did one on the election part:

Why is one consensus critical and the other's not?
@_date: 2015-10-24 10:54:22
Yeah right. That is a ridiculous strategy. Good luck getting people to use backdoor'ed open source software.

How does this work? send this man 1 bit.
