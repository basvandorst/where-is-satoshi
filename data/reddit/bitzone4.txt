Someone doesn't understand freemarket capitalism with limit resources...its going down because it went up, people are selling it and with a large number of trades the price will be driven down as then they need to compete to sell, when less trade occurs, demand increases, and so price increases.

And btw when bitcoin reaches 80k 140k+ don't expect some small loss along the way.. it could wipe your portfolio more than 30k per coin or 50%. We will have ups and down but always going to the top just like [this](

At least the fee is way better than buying cash in Bitcoin ATM's

Np I downvoted. Bitcoin network was attacked and spammed by Rogev agenda to push BCH on the Cryptomap. Bitcoin fees are very low right now less than 1$ also Segwit has been activated and lightning will destroy altcoins.

Nobody knows the price short term. But you must be blind if you can't see a trillion$ market cap in the near future.

I don't know how u came up with 2026? An average of 1800 BTC is mined daily until 2020. By the end of 2020, there will be 18,731,787 Bitcoin. So this screenshot is more likely from the near future.
