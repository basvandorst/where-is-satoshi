plenty of people would love such an option.
also, not a very good comparison. paypal is a payment method at the end of the day, not a currency

It's full development of game server software for my companies mobile games. I change my title every time I say it, seems to be getting more confusing every time.

It's a P2P system, the closer you get to complete, the less people that have the blocks to send out, just like when you're sat at 99% on a torrent for the same amount of time it took to get there.

I'm a web developer (freelance) and game server infrastructure developer (full time).
AKA I spend most of my time developing systems using web technlogies that keep blinking changing :D

Yeah, this is going to end badly. Have fun everyone :D
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:29:57
exactly that. it's good fun, lots of challenges that are rarely solved, and even less likely to ever be published (can't blame big companies for not telling people how they do awesome things), so googlefu only gets me so far when hitting big problems.

I'm still a sceptic, have yet to put in a penny. Hoping to start selling my products for bitcoin as a way into the currency instead of "converting" my current cash. This feels like a much safer approach to entering the market, and will allow me to completely separate the currencies in my mind

do you only give me money if you win? cause that's boring ;)
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:45:18
would definitely have to bribe everyone else, bribing the op isn't going to send you to the top ;)

What tool are you using to generate this report?
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:45:47
nah, you beat me damnit! ;)

Planned maintenance for a server move, should be back up shortly
