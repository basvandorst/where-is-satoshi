Catholicism is a good analogy - wealth ended up concentrated in the hands of the clergy which eventually became so extreme that it was replaced in Europe with protestantism. 
The cult like nature of bitcoin is self serving, mass adoption only serves early adopters. Wealth is increasingly concentrated and peasants are left scrabbling for the scraps.

But even more concentrated. Also it seems to me that whereas many of the richest Americans are self made - the increased adoption will leave the masses scrabbling over an increasingly dwindling supply. Driving more and more wealth through inflation, never mind traditional financial economies of scale.

I don't think bit coin is dead, it seems to me that there are too many large investors to let it crash completely. What I worry about is that these large investors / early players are slowly cashing out to avoid this crash.
As for falling transactions I was going by the block chain chart, If I'm misinterpreting this then pleased to know why.

Bye bye bitcoin support!

They will not just be individual investors, it will be pension funds, insurance companies etc. Financiers gambling with everyone's money. Driving up the price. Where you have this many bit coins in control of one organisation, where bitcoin has a finite supply, do you really think this is a good thing? It's developing a fund with the ability to manipulate prices at a whim. Financed by those who don't want an alternate monetary system to succeed. TL/ DR You are praising your rapists.

Why would anyone discontinue using banks when the possibility of loosing all your money very easily still looms? And regarding paper wallets, unless stored in a bank vault it's still vulnerable to loss or damage. And doesn't earn interest? Help me understand. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:07:09
Why do you want them to suppress the story?? Just because they are reporting on bit coin they don't have to be part of the circle jerk. If they reported only the good news and not the bad  it would be a fucking rag. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 12:33:09
you can't pump thousands of dollars into a gumball dispenser, and then buy drugs with the gumballs on the silkgumball market. Ok that doesn't make complete sense but think you get the gist. Bitcoin is too brilliant an innovation for criminal entities to ever die. Long live bitcoin. Or a better regulated alternative.

"Though the report neglects to mention bitcoin by name, indications suggest the reference of embracing and adapting to new “contactless payments,” serve as a subtle cue to the e-commerce community to keep a close eye on digital currencies"
That means NFC payments... seeing images of Jesus in toast now!

I think your missing the meaning behind he words - of course it's going to be hard to find someone who is against bitcoin and actually understands it. Because if you are your not likely to publicise yourself with anything to do with bitcoin, and that's how journos find people to speak to.

Problem is that someone can walk into a western union (scum scum blah) with a card they are paid onto, and then someone can walk out of a cafe with a wadge of cash in Zanzibar. It simply isn't that easy with bitcoin and I doubt it will ever be. 
Further up the scale, large transfers, may be viable but the price volatility matters far more when talking about thousands. So unless you have the transfer recipient able to convert back instantly (and withdraw, or risk it getting stolen) then you risk losing allot, and people won't tolerate risk at these levels.

It hasn't re-enabled withdrawals it's said it will, in a week. Well with all the honest bit coin companies out there, why wouldn't you trust them!
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:18:20
Trust? you have to be kidding?
You can't trust that the £ you put in will be the £you can spend. You can't even trust that the £ you transfer will be the £ someone can withdraw internationally. 
You can't trust that the exchange will go bust / get hacked / be scamming. 
You can't trust that you wont loose the bitcoin through spyware, hacking, human fallacy. You can't trust that you wont lose your "paper wallet". 
You can't trust that a 51% attack won't break the network over night. You can't trust that the prices aren't being manipulated by "whales". 
You can't trust that the millions of dormant coins aren't going to flood the market suddenly bringing on an even greater crash. 
am I missing anything?
