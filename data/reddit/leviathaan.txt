Right, you can't snort coke from the back of the hookers with crypto, I'm out guys. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 00:10:06
why do you think that?

I have £2k, should I wait with my buying until the correction occurs?
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:57:29
LBC is horrible here in the UK, ask price is usually £10-15 higher than market value..
@_date: 2017-02-24 00:30:16
Don't you lose more on the transaction fees that way? Or is that proportional with the transaction education amount?
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:04:04
And if you could please update the thread with the link.
RemindMe! tomorrow
@_date: 2017-02-26 19:24:42
Thanks for explaining. So the problem is, because of the blocksize limit not every transaction can be registerd, so the transaction will have to wait for a block with sufficient space? Transactions of higher value need more space?

There are only 100k people trading bitcoin?

What happens if you lose your phone? (and the app gets removed from the store)
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:58:49
All I think this is a poor attempt from Gizmodo to buy some cheap coins. Looking at the post history of this kid most of the articles have a sour taste, I don't think he is a happy person.
As long as the darknet is using bitcoin, or China has to put effort to compete with bitcoin, doesn't look like it's dying.

If half of the miners are shut down, would the difficulty decrease automatically?

Create a new wallet, select "I have a seed" option.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:15:56
On the other hand transfers take ages, not very optimal for day-to-day purchases
@_date: 2017-02-24 00:19:18
When was that?
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:09:01
In economic terms they might have bigger leverage tho
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:19:20
Why Japan?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:42:09
what is this?
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:38:37
When is segwit going to be activated?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:46:25
this is new for me, blows my mind lol.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:21:29
Everyone will get the news at the same time. By the time we're about to SELL, the price has already crashed.
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:42:01
Trust mouse? Loll
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:35:12
I had once, when the ETF was denied. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:10:26
op is lacking basic opsec ffs 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:05:43
Now I wonder if this mini crash was generated by that stupid article 
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:30:04
They don't have funds, many computers still running Windows XP. It's not their fault. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:42:26
Money can't buy class
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:14:31
Too late, the price is already up trending
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:02:38
Op wants to sell his coins but not pay tax  
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:56:07
Using blockchain centralized is just an unnecessary overhead, you are way better of using OLTP DBs instead. The beauty of crpyto is its decentralized nature.

I prefer fees to not be 0, as that would allow spamming the block chain.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:52:53
They would be better off accepting LTC
