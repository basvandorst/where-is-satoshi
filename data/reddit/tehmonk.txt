Does anyone know where I can mine crypto I have a gtx 1060 6gig vram and 16 gig ddr4 ram 3.6ghz i7
I'm a noob so would need help setting it up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:52:07
Buying more next dip for sure. What are your thoughts on futures and it's affect on BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:04:10
LETS GO!
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:25:15
Ok :(
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:36:28
So to be clear we need to report any gains to who? Do we really have to? Asking for a friend.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:34:23
I don't buy this. Get it?
People are always buying esp during dips
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:33:34
I hear you but I think it's necessary to learn the hard way myself. My gut tells me it will dip in a day or two. Worst case it goes up 10-20% I miss out and buy back in. Wish me luck.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:46:47
I understand it's no guarantee however it's better than not having one set at all. You don't have one set?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:58:18
You seem rude and seem to have an issue. Who said anything about a problem or crying? We as individuals can do as we please with our own money / crypto. Yeesh
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:59:23
am i the only one here about to sell at 12,250 then wait for a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:27:33
Do you know why cryptos are so interrelated with value increase or decline? I can't figure it out.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:40:45
What about the average worldwide consumer coming to the conclusion that a limited digital currency is a more sound place to put their funds than in an inflation ridden currency that has proven time and time again that the value of said currency drops over time due to increasing printing of bills?
The more investors the higher the value. Big numbers like 200k don't seem so outlandish if you believe in this cryptocurrency. More people are learning of Bitcoin and appreciating what it stands for.
My real concern is the fact that there are literally 1200+ alternatives and growing. I really wish there were a few contenders but I still believe that a main cryptocurrency will be adopted by the masses and at this point in time it looks like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:06:10
I am pretty inexperienced with this stuff but after such a great day we should expect some sort of correction, no? This is crazy.
@_date: 2018-09-04 03:43:06
Offer shoes and a handbag should the price rise.

Bro bitcoin is just getting started.  Risk to reward is heavily in your favor.
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:34:53
Wow can I suck your dick? Congrats.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:26:27
When people like you start saying you'd be delusional to invest now simply means we are nearing a time that would be wise to invest, it's all part of the cycle.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:07:33
Not necessarily.
@_date: 2019-10-09 22:55:24
lol. well said
@_date: 2019-10-31 14:11:55
May I tell you of our Lord and Savior?
@_date: 2019-10-08 03:20:18
Explain in layman's terms
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:23:59
Not me.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:10:13
Sorry mate. Should break even at least if you wait, could take a year or two.
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:02:06
Recently bought at 10k like a few weeks ago. Hopefully it will be a trend shift.
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:42:18
@_date: 2019-02-19 04:33:51
Hook a brother w student debt up!
@_date: 2019-10-31 14:13:02
Could be a good day for BTC. Grab some pocorn and candy and watch the chart.
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:36:28
just because you cant see something doesnt mean it has no value. Just look at the derivative market!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:50:05
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:00:04
Mine still isn't through...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:34:42
Holy shit just went over 10k, congrats guys.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:15:59
But you can't sell w a wallet right still better than being unable to do anything
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:26:27
Hold up, that should be 3 Buys, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING!?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:52:30
I want to buy so bad ppl say it'll drop but shit keeps mooning
@_date: 2019-12-05 20:02:24
This is Binance rep. How may I help?
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:04:06
What about the futures. They control the market.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:59:08
Seriously this makes me hesitant because what if there's a crash and you can't do anything...
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:23:18
I just read an analysis saying bitcoin will drop to $3,500 before rebounding. I kinda believe that too. Here's a link and it's worrying I would love to take advantage of a dip like that. Thoughts?

@_date: 2019-01-05 06:13:03
BUT it wasn't at 3k? Calling the exact top and bottom is a fools errand. Be more realistic. a sell at 15k and buy a 4k would be excellent still. You could look at the major dot coms and be like, "man if I sold apple at the top and bought back at the bottom I'd be rich" well no shit Sherlock!!! Saying you could've sold the top and bought the bottom is just stupid.
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:15:42
Laws are still grey in regards to digital asset taxes.
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:45:34
And we're dropping. HODL ME.
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:50:35
Crypto tax laws are not clear in the US. Send me a .gov link and prove me wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:11:49
Covesting and blockport. Gonna be huge.

@_date: 2019-01-23 00:35:33
Um depends on the relationship.
Mine doesn't give a fuck but supports my passion.
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:35:33
Let's suffer together! Happy New Year ya bunch of animals.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:12:29
Same with mine.

Turns out bitgrail also won't allow me to get a csv that's just great
@_date: 2019-09-08 12:11:54
The thing isn't as sure as the sun rising i'm afraid. There's a really good chance bitcoin will be the chosen digital currency but it is still speculation and will be until people spend it regularly.
Bitcoin has first move advantage. I agree fiat is highly flawed but another digital asset could come along and reign supreme ultimately. We don't know. Nobody knows. We are all speculators here who see the benefits and potential of something like bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-21 23:04:59
Got 2 on my ledger nano s will wait until 100k a coin then pay off my student loans!
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:13:53
Haha! Only 250k in student debt! Got 2 bitcoin on a ledger. Hodl.
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:31:27
It has been at 6k+ for a bit now, better than nothing.
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:33:20
Hmmm to convert all my savings to bitcoin or not to. The possibilities.
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:50:14
I love  listening to what he has to say.
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:16:37
Most often you have 300k+ in student debt because your a doctor who can pay it off. Otherwise what the fuck were you studying!?
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:14:12
He meant he's short himself.
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:24:18
People don't change 
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:23:24
Bullish. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:19:52
Funny thing is banks are due for reckoning with the invention of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:24:42
Did it hurt.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:28:45
So you think buying a big chunk of an asset at once is smarter? With the unpredictability in this market DCA makes complete sense.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:13:02
I don't but you recommend spending all your funds at one time rather than accumulate?
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:14:12
With the unpredictable price in the short term why would I catch a falling knife in one shot? Nobody knows the bottom but I think it's near that's why I'm averaging in. It makes sense to me, maybe not you. Fortunately we are different people with different strategies. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:06:04
Heard of dollar cost averaging? That's how you enter.
@_date: 2018-12-28 01:43:49
Roger that!
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:43:28
are we rich yet?
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:12:06
Such as?
