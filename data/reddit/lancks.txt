Right, just you'd need to have an awful lot of cash in your account to BE tapped. Not really an issue for the 99% (or even the 99.9%).
Unless you meant 'trapped', referring to the FDIC insured deposits? In that case no, they don't.

Just FYI, banks don't take health cards as ID either, except for Quebec. Source: From experience, having worked at a bank.

It's in the OP.

Where are you located? That's a big issue on which payment processor you'd want to use.

He's talking about the ~20% of miners signalling BU support instead of Core support.

Looks like it got in: 
Appears that OP used the ViaBTC Accelerator, or just lucked out and Via got it anyway.

I really don't understand the outrage over the bail-in regulation. 
Primarily corporate debt (i.e. money lent to the bank by other companies) will be turned into equity, so that won't affect the lay-person. If that isn't enough, deposits are tapped, but only deposits outside FDIC coverage - and if you have over $250K in cash in your bank account, you probably need a new financial advisor.

No regulation = more Mt. Goxs. We need *something* in place to prevent con artists from making exchanges... can't just be word of mouth.
