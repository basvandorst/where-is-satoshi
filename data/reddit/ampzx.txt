It's 2 coin so it's a significant amount. How long could this possibly take? This is the longest I've ever waited

Thank you, I really appreciate it! :) This stuff is too technical and complicated for me haha

I'd rather not lose the privacy, that's why I messaged you instead of writing it on the forum. One of the great perks of bitcoin is the privacy :)

Hey is it possible for the transaction to get canceled the way it stands? Or can I rest assured the coin will be in my wallet once mined and can't be canceled?

I've watched a lot of video on it. I'm pretty aware of the majority of it. It's very specific questions I am needing answers for. This is the only question I have atm that confuses me. Pretty much everything else about bitcoin so far I understand.
We know the public key is what everyone gets to see so that's not confusing to me. But the private key is needed to create a digital signature in order for the blockchain to be able to trace back and verify that you do own whatever amount of bitcoin you are trying to send. The confusing part is how do they know that the private key is correct? What if someone took your public key and used their own fake private key? I'm aware it would be refused by the blockchain but how does it know that it isn't legit without actually knowing what the private key is?

I kind of understand what you're saying. I just don't understand why false history can't be replicated on a block that doesn't actually have history. If each coin had to check out on a main website that would verify the coin was mined I'd understand. It's also puzzling thinking that if you duplicated your hard drive you wouldn't have 2 wallets you could use.

If you give a person your bitcoin address, in order to send you funds, what's stopping them from spending funds from said address? Isn't the address what you need to spend the funds? Wouldn't it be like giving someone your paypal password in order to deposit funds into your account and they could withdraw if they chose?

"Only the one true Private Key can encrypt a signature that can be decrypted by the Public Key."
That was exactly what I was looking for. That is what i need to understand more of but just conceptually I'm satisfied with this answer. It was what I was confused about.
