I spoke with a senior, international banker, with MBA, and he said it's not a good idea to be a "currency" because the price is too volatile and can't be regulated again manipulation.  
The problem is, the centralized banking is susceptible to manipulation because of it's structure, so it's a lose lose.

You need to try [Coinbase]( so far this is the best one I have used.

2. Link your bank up in about 90 seconds.   
3. Sleek, simple interface.   
4. Works well in the USA.   
5. Easy to send/receive bitcoins to other people.    
I've tried about 5 sites, this is by far the best one I have tried yet, and very professionally done.

I'm not the one who posted "It will be worth 100,000 one day". 
I have some ideas about why it won't be 100k a coin.  
 
If you think that one day, 21 million coins, will be worth **$2,100,000,000,000 USD** or 2.1 trillion dollars, this means that guys with 1000 bitcoins will be worth 100 million dollars. Do the laws of the universe,economics, and the progression of technologies we haven't seen yet, really allow this many people to become that filthy rich for mining invisible coins from SHA-2 encryption?

What if the entire bitcoin network was created to pay millions of people to slowly chip away and map out the entire encryption structure. And at the same time, smart anti bank people voluntarily participate and identify themselves as being pro-crypto and the gov. has a perfectly complete list of all the dissidents.

@_date: 2013-12-16 20:42:05


Harsh words, but makes it easy for me to see what is going on here. And I can respond to this in 2 ways. 
1. You are a "bear raider" revealing him/herself and you are shilling, because you are fully aware that this is occurring live, now, and you'd like to maintain that BTC is a benevolent creation and nothing can ever be done wrong with it.
2. OR - You actually don't know shit about how markets behave, you don't know how much market manipulation actually happens.  But then again, to claim you know how a cryptocurrency market behaves is rather naive because this is the first time one like this has gained mainstream attention.

BTC: It has already been proven that there is such a huge underground market in bitcoin that even if it goes down to $10 people want to use it as a way to discreetly move large sums of money in seconds.  So even if it turns out to be lead, instead of gold, lead still has a value.

OP, you have some good points but you seem to have missed some major points.
In 1971 the World Bank plotted to go off of gold entirely, creating the [Bretton woods system]( was put into place, which basically tied all the worlds money to the US dollar, which we print at will... this has caused a lot of problems.  
I'm not saying he was a boyscout, but coincidentally [Kennedy opposed going off the gold standard]( which may have led to his demise. I digress. 
The problem with tying all the money together and having global banking corroboration, this leads to international monetary fraud happening like the [LIBOR](
