@_date: 2017-12-09 18:46:39
You guys need to go read the Bitcoin whitepaper and come back when you realize what bitcoin is meant to replace....
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:57:44
well the thing is my friends are Luddites and thinks bitcoin is shady fml
@_date: 2015-12-04 23:25:51
maybe you should have posted this on the darknets hmm
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:35:50

your bank must suck,my bank did not charge me...
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:43:30
not right now I can't 'instantly' and globally, if it was as easy as buying something of amazon load of people would be into bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:05:17

ARE YOU SERIOUS Dominica and the Dominican Republic are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
@_date: 2014-09-23 01:51:06
I can has bits?
@_date: 2014-12-16 11:30:18
depends on where you live, if you live in America circle.com is the easiest....
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:39:22
eww a robocoin nty, no way I will be scanning my hand into that thing...

I heard about it in 2009 and stayed away FML
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:58:43
still hard as balls to purchase bitcoin 'instantly'
@_date: 2014-11-08 20:55:56
@_date: 2014-08-29 19:28:50
what proof do you want hmm, xD
@_date: 2014-09-28 16:18:07
more cheap coins :D
@_date: 2014-09-11 03:42:50
oh ok, lol disregard my message xD
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:24:34
they want control...
@_date: 2014-12-08 01:32:57
obviously intentional, also in the show Continuum they mention cryptocurency such as bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-17 06:39:03
I believe on btc-e it's only through wire transfer, but circle.com (accepts debit/credit card also) is instant I used it awhile ago bought btc, withdrew seconds later.
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:43:51
I had a similar instance, and guess what happened they asked for verification so I send it in. Then they were like, thank you so much for verifying. Then another circle.com rep sent me this "I want to first thank you for providing us with the documentation you have provided. After careful consideration, we have decided that too many unusual aspects to your account exist. As a result, we unfortunately cannot offer you our service. We have terminated your account and we appreciate your understanding."
wth,  I still have some bits in my account, contacted them to send it to me, nothing, no response, yet...
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:30:40
I don't get why you all or all so concerned with what Warren Buffet said, yes he is a great financial guru, but you have to remind yourself the dude doesn't even use a computer on his desk neither a smart phone, he is mostly a technological luddite, he is still holding firm to this aging financial system. I like him, that doesn't mean I drink all his kool-aid. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:45:44
~1m Bitcoins hmm how did you come up with that one?
@_date: 2014-08-29 02:42:11
I would say it plays a large part on the economy there. It is located in Portsmouth, the second town of Dominica. In Portsmouth the entire area surrounding the University is geared and catered toward the students there, down to apartments, eating areas, and supermarkets to name a few. For example, Whitchurch one of the local IGA super-centers' Portsmouth branch of that supermarket is completely transformed to an American style supermarket even with American imported goods.
@_date: 2014-08-29 02:46:48
In terms of cellphone use nearly everyone has one more than one actually 2-3 per person. There are more cellphones in Dominica than people. In regards to smartphone use the most common would be Blackberries, although some would say Android is quickly taking over. Practiclly everyone I know owns a smartphone. This has prompted one of the local telephone companies to upgrade their network to ''HSPA+/4G'', due to be rolled out this month.
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:44:39
I still prefer circle
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:19:36
my card treats it as a credit transaction :D
@_date: 2014-08-28 20:08:31
It's spelled Dominica... I should know, I live there...
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:21:12
how is this possible :O
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:39:39
too bad they closed my account without warning, and have some of my btc and will 'apparently get it 6 months after, (the time it takes them to do 'investigations' 
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:35:34
I like how they use an image for the secure ssl in the website description, lol
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:12:09
it's raining bits
p.s. nice music
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:01:46
@_date: 2014-12-21 04:35:41
too bad circle does, they closed my account and won't give me my money, until they do a 6 month investigation, now I'm stuck with not buying bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-09-11 03:36:10
@_date: 2014-08-29 12:29:42
Sure, the people here are very friendly and eager to help each other.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:59:59
lucky you... you can link your chequeing account, all I can use is my credit/debit card and get charged a nice 2.9% circle fee...
@_date: 2014-12-13 02:39:11
check out circle.com you can buy bitcoin instantly using a debit card or credit card
@_date: 2014-09-05 02:49:54
I heard about bitcoin in 2009 ignored it should of bought some would of been rolling in the bitcoins now :(
@_date: 2014-09-11 03:49:34
good thing I use two factor 
@_date: 2014-10-04 04:09:03

Exactly the old ones are the ones holding back progress....
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:48:49
I live in Dominica hit me up when you all get the chance...
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:50:18

@_date: 2014-12-13 14:00:30

@_date: 2014-08-30 11:19:54
@_date: 2014-09-23 22:59:19
well it's going up right now
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:54:17


 Caribbean, what I should of said is there is no option to instantly buy bitcoins, right now, available to anyone with a credit card
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:46:00
there are gay people in Dominica just not out in public...
@_date: 2014-10-26 12:08:49
and of course I'm always late :(
@_date: 2014-09-05 14:15:40
well you can mine alternative coins and sell them for bitcoin.... made some bicoin that way, but if you really want selling and buying is the way to get in quick
@_date: 2014-09-05 02:47:40
you can mine or trade on bitcoin markets
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:28:18
yes, 'they'
@_date: 2014-10-26 12:24:12
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:13:12
Here they are
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:08:38
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:57:21
um done already
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:16:30
sucks that they closed my account for no reason and are 'investigating' sigh 6 months till I get my bits, which they have
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:43:28
ah, I feel the moon rising though due to the whole tomorrow you know...
@_date: 2015-01-16 05:58:21
look it's Mark Karpeles new site @_@
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:51:16
also cex.io since they halted cloud mining, they are probably selling their bitcoin profits for straight fiat to cut loses, and well get back into the game when things cool down
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:50:52
um work
@_date: 2015-01-26 00:40:57
apparently coinbase is going to the moon
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:20:46
circle.com used to be awesome until they closed my account for no reason
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:36:05
ouch which exchange is that
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:25:17
maybe cause they close your account with no warning and hold your btc, until they do 'investigation' 
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:48:36
where's the answer?
@_date: 2015-05-10 02:38:56
then the blockchain would be enourmas, making it centralized since the common day folks wouldn't want to be storing 1tb of data onto their harddrives increasing everyday
@_date: 2019-03-27 18:44:53
Something about your comment just made me feel warm and content...
@_date: 2019-03-10 02:22:25
this looks like Singapore 
@_date: 2019-03-13 01:09:17
A massive one at that
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:00:26
so how big of an SSD would one need to get assuming they don't want to worry about upgrading it in 10 years?
@_date: 2019-11-25 15:30:59
Meanwhile some exchanges are still charging 0.0005 BTC to withdraw!
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:18:01
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:07:52
scratch circlejerk (circle) of that list
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:45:10
yes he did
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:05:24
I'm scared to buy, waiting for that correction or just do it?
@_date: 2016-12-22 03:25:44
this seems appropriate 
@_date: 2016-12-22 13:57:01
We are going to crack $1000 I can feel it, then ye know yeah....

@_date: 2019-10-25 19:04:34
mmm good old dollar cost averaging
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:46:38
I think for things like that you have the option to remove it and if you keep it they cut you a deal for the advertisement, or something like that
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:03:30
doubt it, he advocated keeping all your keys
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:21:45
So that means you just can't send from a segwit wallet to theirs right? Totally fine sending from their wallet to a segwit one right?
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:38:51
Wow, that sounds like a wonderful idea.
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:38:58
this is probably in the UK it keeps on spitting out GBP
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:57:44
cheap coins incoming :D
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:42:50
@_date: 2019-10-17 20:24:23
or buy it from a decentralized exchange, or sell it for some other 'anonymous crypto'.....
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:29:15
That's an accurate picture.
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:21:53
It depends on the island, this ad smells fishy though
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:45:52
of course you can
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:39:04
Sorry for the price drop, I bought some today, I swear this always happens....
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:23:19
ye bad voodoo indeed
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:01:46
Oh, no where close to too late, dollar cost averaging, buy a fixed amount every month.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:08:17
Is it me or is bitcoin hitching a ride on the FH launch today o.o
@_date: 2019-04-20 13:07:39
Yes, there was lots of euphoria.
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:25:53
Just send them to a segwit address, you'll probably have to create a new wallet, not sure which wallet you're using. Most well used wallets have been upgraded to segwit 
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:19:49
Hey will you point me to some recommended apps to us?
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:14:52
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:36:21
DON'T PUT THAT in passphrase.io it's NSFW
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:55:05
It's mandatory 
@_date: 2016-09-26 13:47:39
going to have more fun challenges?
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:07:32
well circle did something similar with me then they were look opps sorry
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:53:36
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:48:52
This is indeed misleading rather than simply stating your opinion why not give the people a brief history and let them decide for themselves, instead of shoving it down their throats...
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:19:00
I sent a transaction with 1.00 sat/B it got confirmed in a couple of hours ��
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:09:30
this is the bitcoin I remember *tears in eyes*
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:55:21
I guess there is hope for me then :D waiting since December
edit: it got confirmed :D
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:42:47
well I sent a 1.00 sat/B not too long ago from legacy to segwit and it got confirmed in a couple of hours so...
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:00:01
just so you know according to the US bitcoin is classified as property
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:23:24
why Grenada though?
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:22:47
2009 :( :( :(
@_date: 2015-09-18 02:45:13
well you could try cex.io
@_date: 2019-09-10 13:39:18
I know of this one country that won't accept foreign currency with markings on it...
@_date: 2016-10-05 12:11:01
Caribbean people are uniformed (well not all) and afraid of change, quick to jump on new technology or ideas calling it a scam, for example look at what happened in Dominica...
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:50:06
so the price drops thanks to NSA -___-, or to people who don't understand bitcoin hmmm
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:40:10
Soon we won't need them,they will be/are obsolete and will be crying for us to return. This will be my response ..l..
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:22:40
is now a good time to buy, or nah?
@_date: 2015-11-30 01:27:26
this post reminds me of that one Caribbean country who shot themselves in the foot aka Dominica
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:40:19


in the Narutoverse depends yes,no, maybe, actually no, eventually joined the light....
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:06:43

@_date: 2017-05-22 04:03:12

@_date: 2017-05-25 16:49:34

@_date: 2015-03-06 00:37:46

@_date: 2017-05-24 17:17:24

strap in guys somethings happening, CHEAP COINS INCOMING 
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:00:41
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:36:05
If you take a look at this it's clear what is happening
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:32:00
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:01:09
as long as the provide identification nothing wrong with that
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:18:47
so what do we do as a runner of a node?
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:01:13
you can try this
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:10:53
and you are confirmed now :D
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:29:59
$3,000 is the next psychological barrier, but holy shit if this continues 1 bitcoin is going to be $10,000 unfucking believable, unfucking believable, what a time to be alive like holy FUCK!
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:58:51
bitcoin was the first, the technology has been unleashed and no stopping blockchain tech
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:02:18
hmm, but BTC/USD is 249.00 on cex :S
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:55:08
that's why you encrypt your phone and use some form of login to the wallet
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:58:55
so armory is like a full node right, so how do I check to see my node or is that hidden?
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:25:32
hmm this link to bitcointalk seems appropriate to the subject matter
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:19:09
already did, ^^ the first in the Eastern Caribbean
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:37:47
well I've seen it go to ATH of $1,000+ the last time and go all the way to $100 so meh
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:35:52
and we're going up again guys
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:38:07
Bitcoin is pseudonymous. Sending and receiving bitcoins is like writing under a pseudonym. If an author’s pseudonym is ever linked to their identity, everything they ever wrote under that pseudonym will now be linked to them. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:43:07
I'll just use the Tardis
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:02:08
thought this might be appropriate in case something happens to the surge in the bitcoin price
@_date: 2015-03-27 20:16:25
exactly once you plug in a badusb that's infected you might as well burn your pc
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:51:27
wow, probably a random delay
@_date: 2015-03-29 00:42:57
try cex.io
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:21:18
I had the same problem, I just re installed it again ontop of my current install pointing it to the same install folder, try that, also run as admin
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:15:41
this gif seems appropriate
 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:55:00

@_date: 2017-05-09 03:07:10
don't worry OP you will get your chance soon I remember when the price was from October $150–$200 in November, rising to $1,242 on 29 November 2013, then
@_date: 2015-03-04 07:25:16

@_date: 2017-05-09 03:54:16
and they probably never bothered to upgrade...
@_date: 2015-03-17 02:39:15
try to redeem there 
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:23:30
selling their altcoins probably due to the DDOS on poloniex and trying to offset the loss with the gains from bitcoin, since bitcoin is showing no sign of stopping it's rise for now
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:59:41

@_date: 2017-07-26 17:32:52

@_date: 2015-02-19 03:40:07

hmm from what I gather they are targeting people who participated in the DAO Tokens, so this does not have much baring on the other ICOs, most ICOs these days specifically try to block US buyers, because they knew of all this crap which follows the US
