1- Ratings are the basis for lending or credit worthiness 
2- Completely irrelevant in bitcoin and would only matter if banks were needed to fractional reserve lend to customers.. which they cannot with bitcoin.
3- This is bitcoin anyone who buys it already doesnt trust these corrupt incumbents. 
i wish them luck in depressing the price while they accumulate

10 billion / 4 million(max actively daily traded coin) =  
two thousand five hundred
 
2500 + 9335 = 11835 per BTC

incorrect, there are not 18million available because of loss and far far less available at any given day...  
If you check order books are between 1-2million active coins for sale in the markets on any given day.

on testnet 1.7MB was achieved but this is using transaction types that do not exsist yet (i.e they had 300 inputs and 300outputs per transaction). It is in theory possible to transmit and for the network to sync with 4.5MB blocks.(thats with ALL current node operators  able to download and confirm worldwide in 10mins or less)

keep telling people till you at least 2 people have listened and brought bitcoin. 
Just make sure they know to repay the debt to you they have to ensure they bring in 2 more people each too.
Its this simple

truth is none of us know when mainstream adoption will happen but if you compare it to the growth of facebook we really are hitting the elbow in the adoption curve....

in bitcoin we are somewhere around December 06 and April 07 in terms of where facebook was with users.
