It was a mix, yes maybe confirmation of China ban was a bigger portion of the drop than Dimon. But Dimon was the icing on the cake, the wales saw an opportunity to shake out weak hands, and took it and pulled it off pretty successfully.

The thing is, Chinese exchanges weren't the major volume exchanges for months now. In fact "Western" exchanges are back topping volumes again, after the Korean exchanges went crazily high in volume, and then quietened down. This is good, because Korean authorities have intimated their intent to oversee/regulate more - if Korean exchanges topped volume and then were banned from trading that would cause mayhem to the Bitcoin price.

Actually, a good song analogy - that's exactly what being in the Bitcoin space is like - for small holders. People with more capital probably aren't under as much pressure and probably perform much better.

They'd get nervous and sell into the wale's crash, the wale would then send in a buy wall, price would rise massively, and wale would sell out at a strong profit. That explains a lot of price movements. I mean with  Bitcoin, as soon as it breached $3000 to the decimal place a massive buy wall came in - that's a pre-planned wale action. The small holder is the guy who bought at $4500, got nervous, and sold at $3000. He loses, wale wins.

This was clearly wales taking advantage of the bad news flow, and they pulled it off flawlessly.

What is this? A lesson that the wales control the market. They sold at 5K because they wanted to - then unforeseen events like the banker mouthing off hastened the decline - it would have probably settled around 3500 but the wales wanted it down to 3K, and that's what they got - soon as it dipped below 3K, around 2900 massive, massive buy wall.
Another day in Bitcoin, another wale richer. Some small holder squashed. And so it goes.
