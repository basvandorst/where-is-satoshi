What are you talking about there was a reddit post and he even came out on twitter and said something along the lines of “no need to worry I just took it down because I felt like it no real reason why I did it”
It has been pretty commonly known that this happened months ago.

Banks/Govts clamping down on it really shows their weakness and destroys the trust people have for Fiat. This would only increase Bitcoin. Making it harder to get only drives up the price - supply vs demand. The transaction speed/volume has improvements coming and we are still in the early stages - the tech will evolve. I don't "believe" anyone I make my own decisions based on facts and knowledge which is why I asked your reasoning for your conclusion.
I understand your doubt and hesitation, thanks for the information.

I looked at BTC during Silk Road days and then again at about $300 and $1000 USD (it popped up at work with the crypto locker virus). Each time people told me it was silly. Finally bit the bullet at 3K went hard into mining and also bought in at 6K. Those same people are still telling me it's silly while questioning how I can afford to buy things far nicer than theirs. I would say 99% of people are incapable of independent thought.

How the hell could you make this estimation with the facts at hand? Adoption is up, improved tech is close, BTC making headlines, real estate markets about to drop and the next GFC looming, multiple useless alts seeing increased market caps that will soon come to the realisation they are useless. Logical conclusion would be BTC skyrocketing. What facts are you using to conclude this?

So you did something illegal and bitch when the financial company you used handed over documents they were obliged to hand over under regulation?
Even if VISA wanted to risk their ass for you they wouldn't last long. The supplier is not under US regulation, VISA is. That is why decentralisation is so important - but this would still be illegal and you would still get caught if you are this reckless. You are not here for the right reasons my friend.

To create a currency and asset that is controlled only be oneself, cannot be forcibly taken by any authority and to give banking and financial power back to the people - at the very least creating competition in the market and forcing the financial institutions to act responsibly.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:39:49
Incorrect. It is a more efficient way to use existing block size effectively increasing capacity a block can take without increasing its size and impact on decentralization. This increases the amount of transactions we can fit into 1mb - a form of compression.
Nodes do not have to store more data for segwit.
This is like saying zipping two 1mb files into 2x 0.5mb and sending as 1mb total is the same as just sending the original 2mb. This is not a smart approach and you are spreading misinformation.
If you want to compare technology advances look at email. We still have extremely small limits on email, but we can still send larger files using email via things such as Dropbox links etc. This has not made email useless and in fact has been vital in preserving its existence.

Bitcoin Cash has no means of scaling than simply increasing block size and no future development or ideas outside of that. When Bitcoin finally increases block size after Lightning and Segwit and has less block size than Bitcoin Cash but can provide more transactions and use that space far more efficiently along with much higher volume and greater decentralization what do these people think will happen to Bitcoin Cash?
It will literally have no advantages over Bitcoin and be a inferior coin. Bitcoin is not ready for what they want it to be unless it becomes centralised, and as Satoshi made the coin completely decentralised and therefore out of even his own control, controllable only by consensus, then decentralisation was obviously the most important purpose of Bitcoin. Yet they claim to do what Satoshi wanted and what his white paper suggests - but Satoshi relinquished all control for the greater good.
These people supporting Bitcoin Cash are fools with no foresight, it only has another 2 years at most to serve any purpose.
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:55:51
Satoshi had one idea* for a scaling plan which was to increase the block size. He was also incorrect about how quickly storage etc has evolved. Satoshi did not have control of Bitcoin and to hold a man to a single idea for future development developed 10 years ago is m absurd - no different to me holding you to thoughts you expressed 10 years ago.
It's time we stop likening Satoshi to god and treating Bitcoin like a cult. He was human.

@_date: 2017-12-23 22:09:40
Except it's not scalable, you can't just keep increasing the size for more light eventually it would not fit. It also takes up too much space, more resources to make and gets harder and harder for people to own one. Sure it bandaids the problem quickly but it quickly becomes obsolete by its own nature.

Until you realise Bitcoin has increase at least 5x per year with 2015/16 being the only exceptions due to the MtGox incident causing uncertainty and instability. We have seen recent incidents with Bitfinex and China ICO ban but fact is Bitcoin has proven itself resilient, had now attracted worldwide interest and is seeing increased adoption. The increase in market cap simply reinforces this and is more of a correction to the last two years than a bubble.
My economics teacher always told me it was better to service debt than to save. He had never heard of Bitcoin.
The first real world Bitcoin transactions was 10000BTC for a Pizza, and in 10 years time this post will be a very similar story.

Bitcoin is open source. That means literally anyone can take the code and make their own version. This will however be a separate network. It is a fork that results in two chains however the main chain remains unchanged. This is how Bitcoin was designed so it can be upgraded, improved and most importantly never controlled by a single entity.
Saying there is cause for concern how often and easily Bitcoin is forked reads “I have no idea how bitcoin works or what it is”

The problem is that it defaults to bitcoin cash and makes no mention of it. Everywhere when setting up it says Bitcoin then changes to BCH. Imagine you are a brand new user, heard about BTC hitting ATH and purchased some. You then send to this wallet but never receive and lose your funds.
You will forever have negative connotations about both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin and see them as a scam. This is terrible for crypto as a whole.
I thought this was hyped up so I downloaded the app and only noticed the BCH default wallet due to already knowing the difference. No where does it explain the difference or your default wallet. It simply refers to itself as a Bitcoin wallet and says you can purchase Bitcoin then swaps to a BCH wallet default.
Bait and switch, just the next scam in Roger Ver's book. I don't understand why he hates crypto so much.

On the flip side I put 2.5k in because part of me doesn't believe this bull run is to do with Segwit 2x. As someone who knows a lot about crypto Segwit 2x gives me uncertainty on BTC and makes me nervous - not wanting to be in BTC. A lot of people in Aus have been asking me about BTC and wanting to buy as an investment - they know nothing of Segwit 2x. Bitcoin has proven itself with the China crash. It is extremely resilient and has such a massive volume now it is more stable than ever before. On top of that it is reaching a broader market and a greater coverage. A crash would simply be short term.

I had 5K to go in and put the first half in yesterday after BTC dropped below 7k on US exchanges. Something to note currently BTC is trading 400 USD higher in Aus than US exchanges.
Eg right now I can buy 1 BTC for $10160AUD which is approx. 7770 USD. This also means it's selling higher too (I can currently sell for around 7560USD on the same site). This isn't always the case, last month I bought for about 80USD higher than US exchange prices. So maybe not the best time to buy in Aus. If it drops and the Aus demand goes down to closer to the US price you stand to lose more.

So a millibit is 1000 bits. Kind of like how a millimetre is 1000 metres... wait a minute. So bits can be short for Bitcoin if preceded by milli but not in it's own, kind of like an I before E situation. Oh now you've done it.
