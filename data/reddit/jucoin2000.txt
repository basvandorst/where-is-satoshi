Interesting to know that everyone has a different opinion, welcome to the world of crypto...lol

I thought this interview was going rather well until he opened his mouth...
Now I’m questioning whether this guy actually believes what he is saying or whether he’s just making the statement to make his case for anti crypto currency stick more.  Either way he’s achieved the complete opposite.

Hahahaha...This is pure gold, I’m laughing so much I’m
In danger of soiling myself.  Open your front door, there’s a whole world outside.  Was you actually serious about the reporting to police thing?  Hahaha oh please stop, 
Yeah officer...I’d like to report Reddit for taking down one of my posts...OK...? I’ll get right on it...?

I have the upmost respect towards you as you have used a semi-colon in your response.
Unless of course it was a typo, then our reddit relationship is over and my trust in humanity has hit a new low!!

The funny thing about all this now in 2019, if the real person(s) did step forward you have to ask yourself...Would anyone believe them anyway??

I appreciate every man to his own but I have had nothing but trouble with Blockfolio, many times it’s slow, inaccurate and has sync issues across from your exchanges.

If your look under the &lt;About&gt; tab on this Reddit it will answer 99% of the questions you may have about BTC.  It’s really quite informative.

Bit harsh
