I was at Walgreens staring at a bottle of lube, and I hear a ding from my phone, I look and it's my recurring purchase of Bitcoin. I decided I would just let that $15 roll, and save the money on Lube. I've got dish soap.

Serisouly. Trying to compare the two shows serious ignorance. Owning land is hands down a better investment than owning bitcoin. It's not even comparible.

I bought 2 bitcoins at 6200 and sold both at almost exactly this price.

That's awesome it worked out for you. Too bad it isn't always this way. There's a reason Realtors exist. Sure, some aren't great at what they do, but theirs a lot more than 2% out there that know what they're doing. Theirs also bad doctors out there, doesn't mean you do your own procedures or fill in your own cavities.
At the very least I would get title involved. You're setting yourself up for legal battles between title issues, all the way to IRS reporting. But what do I know, I'm just a parasite ;)

That's not why it's sitting in wallets. It's sitting their because people want to see it rise further and further until they make some kind of decision on executing them into cash.
Let's not pretend like the majority of bitcoin holders plan is to wait until bitcoin is the new currency and all the issue have been worked out before they spend any of it.

You know why us realtors take a cut? Because we know how to get you through the transaction. We know how to keep both buyer and seller out of legal battles, ensure they are purchasing a home in good standing, and God forbid something goes wrong, there is E &amp; O Insurance to cover things. I appreciate the sentiment of wanting to do a direct transaction using Bitcoin, but as a realtor in Phoenix, this has some serious risks to it.

Yeah, fuck those institutions that insure our money they hold for us or give us large loans to buy things we normally wouldn't be able pay cash for!
Jk, cool ring.

You are trying to explain how real estate Works to people that have little to no idea how homes are transacted. I want to try and come off as least offensive as as I can, but you are basically trying to teach first graders algebra at this point.
There is a reason we have title companies, Realtors, banking experts, inspectors and many other institutions and professionals that are involved in a real estate transaction. Land is messy, title reports can be messy, there is a lot of history to a home, and there are a million and one things that can go wrong in a real estate transaction. Treating this like you're selling a $300 mountain bike is simply a way to keep everyone open to lawsuits and complete and total headaches.

I also own multiple homes, have diversified stocks and still have plenty of crypto.
Don't be soiled I made 3x my money back lol.

They weren't actual questions, they were rhetorical ones. You've been told by multiple professionals in the field of real estate you're making a dumb and dangerous decision. I could give a hoot what articles you'd like to send me that will somehow validate your donkey like decision making. I didn't think you're were dismissing me or ignoring me, I know you have your hands full trying to argue with this bombardment of intelligent advice.

Do you even know what it would cost to be represented by a Realtor? Why not just sell it at market value (since it's a sellers market) not take bitcoin (because it's a risky and ridiculous idea that doesn't benefit you one bit) and you'll probably make more in the end, all while being protected by professionals who have insurance in case things go south? I mean you want to sell it for less to take bitcoin, WHY??
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:55:21
You're right. These things can be done without representation. However, you're a different kind of buyer. You take on the risk. Some don't want that risk. Some want piece of mind.

But buying a hard wallet from some new company overseas and storing thousands of bitcoin on it all completely self managed and not insured is the smart way to do things!
Just don't lose that huge password, or the key, or accidently send any to the wrong address, or get hacked or any of the other dozen ways you could lose your coins, lol.
Comparing the security of your money in a bank to holding bitcoin is not even close.

Drugs. That's why that machine is there and probably used quite a bit.
Source, I live in AZ, and Tucson is a very heavy drug city.
