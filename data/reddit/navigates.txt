Are you talking about the picture of the "fly" swatter hitting the butterfly?
Have you ever killed a butterfly with a fly swatter?
I think the butterfly being caught in a net would be more fitting.

If you are new, virwox is the most trustworthy exchange. They are now the oldest running, even before btc-e. They were a second life exchange before bitcoin. AFAIK they have never been hacked. I've had 0 problems with deposits and withdraws since 2012. They should be the  exchange.

I like that virwox takes 48hrs for btc withdrawals. It's never taken longer than that. If someone was to hack your account, this would give you time to possibly cancel the transaction. I think when your account is more active, the withdrawal happens more quickly. I remember getting some coins instantly, but I haven't really bought any coins since they went over $20. 
I stop using mtgox in 2012, been using virwox ever since. They were an exchange for second life long before bitcoin and mtgox. I have had 0 problems with them.

If you want to buy btc using paypal, use virwox. They are the oldest running and most trustworthy exchange. They have never been hacked that I know of and any problems are fixed immediately. They are secretly the  exchange that no one pays attention to. When people were shouting "it's sunday, wait til the fiat comes into exchanges monday", I would be depositing money and buying btc on sundays. I never understood why people thought you couldn't put fiat in on the weekends? I first started using virwox in 2012 when I left mtgox. The only btc I've ever been scammed out of since I started in 2011 was from bitcoinica squeezes. There are a few shortcomings and limits to buying btc on virwox, but when compared to the other exchanges and what has happened to them, those limits can be overlooked.

I think that micro-transactions are one of the coolest features. I can easily send small amounts of money to friends or family members.
For instance, I have a steam friend who can make maps in source and is kinda artistic. I could get him to make me an avatar, logo, or similar. It would be easy to send a small amount of btc as payment for their work and time. Using paypal to do a small transaction like that is quite the headache.
I think btc can work well as a bartering tool. We need to start spedning more with friends and family members we already trust instead of making shady deals on the internet with a chance to get scammed. We already have a trust network built up around us and we should be using our btc on those channels. If I mow my parents grass and they pay me in btc, there is no need for escrow for that transaction.
If most everyone is only separated by 6 degrees or whatever, then we don't need to send our btc very far to have a large impact on its distribution. If I give my friend btc that give his friend btc, and you give your friend btc that gives his friend btc, then our btc may end up colliding. Suddenly people you know have btc that they didn't get from you. Once everyone has a little, there will be much more options for using it.

If you could get every single user of a pool to cooperate, you could get them to report every block found by their miners. You can use the data from the miner to figure out which block was generated. If the pool is trying to hide a found block, there would be a discrepancy in the blocks reported by users and the pool.

If the dogecoin shibes put as much effort into bitcoin as they do into tipping with dogecoin, then bitcoin would be in a better place. The ONLY reason they use dogecoin instead of bitcoin is because the chance for an exponential price increase is greater with dogecoin than for bitcoin. It would be easy for dogecoin to double from 120 sat to 240 sat, but it's hard for bitcoin to double $460 to $920. Every single person involve in dogecoin is in it for the money. If they weren't, then they would be using small amounts of bitcoin to tip. There is nothing different about dogecoin and no reason bitcoin can't do the exact same things people have been doing with doge.

What do bitcoins smell like?

Maybe this is just a test to see how many people click and act interested. If we pass the test, they may put more effort into possibly accepting bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the convoluted singularity of monetary systems.

The Wolf(Bitcoin): You see that, young lady? Respect. Respect for one's elders shows character.
Raquel(Doge): I have character.
The Wolf(Bitcoin): Just because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.
