I'm going to be following this. Ledger is not specifically listed in the article but it does say: "requires a connected hardware wallet, ***like*** Trezor or KeepKey". Trying to get away from Coinbase/CoinbasePro. [

Not trying to be mean, just curious. Do you know what a central bank is? Also, read up on Fractional Reserve Banking.

Agree, my guess is a single person, working with many others to develop, suddenly dropped off the face of the earth, no more communication with other techies and his coins on the blockchain haven't been touched since. I'm thinking he died without letting anyone know how to access his fortune.

I think it's entirely intentional on the part of the IRS. What better way than this to get a list of every Hodler in the U.S.? Definitely a trap.

In Dec 2017 I was looking for a dealership that would accept BTC, unfortunately there was nothing in Florida. I used this site (among others) to look for one. You may want to get added to any sites that list dealerships. I was willing to travel (FL to AL) but not cross country.

Is it possible he's looking for Bitcoin Accepted stickers to put on invoices (bills) he sends out?

Help me out here... I use Coinbase &amp; Ledger, what wallet did you send the BTC to? I'll definitely try it when I see one but can you give me a little more info, recommendation? (I don't typically use my phone for anything financial but I do have Bitpay app on my phone)
