Steady hands, not a bad thing. Look at the non exchange transactions, no effect on that market.

Paper wallets could work for this. Just put the code under a scratch off like a lotto ticket.

This is why cash will never see mass market adoption. Oh wait, it did anyway. 
You just have to learn how to use it, it's not that complex. Nobody blames the bundle of cash sitting on your window sill like a pie for getting stolen, so why blame bitcoin?
 Frankly, thefts like this, if real, and I'm definitly not saying it is, only show mass adoption is happening faster than most of us could have predicted. It's now in demand for thieves, where one year ago they would not care.

If you left a wallet with 10,000 dollars in it and it got stolen, then its not the fault of the wallet manufacture for making it easy, is it. no? So don't blame bitcoin providers for your mistake, and man up.

Theirs no taxes until you cash out, don't do it, just hold.

If target had used exclusively bitcoins, they would not have had the problem with credit cards like they had, helping brand reputation. be sure to mention this.

Look into the size of China. There's millions of interested buyers wanting in before it explodes.

It's bitcoin that is easy to get and your fiat is the difficult thing to offload. That's closer to the truth, fiat has so many rules about identification it isnt funny, while coinbase just requires an email address.

Yeah, and it's a circlejerk at when they don't want to hear every day about how somebody broke into someones house and stole their ps4, so be careful guys. And upon further reading we find they made a lot of the details up, and it still has shit all to do with a ps4. 
2fa, nor the pin, have high odds of being broken separate, let alone together. If they did then it's OP's fault for keeping that much in them in the first place. It's called cold storage, I can't feel pity for failing to do something that has been advised thousands of times around here.

Yes, he is forgetting that other forms of wealth like property will need to be mapped as well. He's off by quite a lot with that assessment cause of that.

They're not losing money at future projected prices, theyre actually still making an amazing profit.

It currently gives heavy players a chance to get their hands on BTC at a higher cost than market **but** they don't bring the price up when they do it that way. Think of a large pool of miners instead of mining buying a few dozen coins an hour, or some such scenario. Yes in comparison to an exchange like mtgox it's not much, but the fact that they plan to consistently buy and not sell could very well make the number skyrocket. It's been influenced by trends much lower than a dozen BTC an hour changing hands. They would not want that to happen until they were completely invested, so it is really in their best interests to hold, that's what they are all doing spare some pizza money here and there. It's a well calculated move, I expect no less from the big money that has moved into it.

Forget 12 hundred is even a barricade, it's undervalued at 12 *thousand* based on china alone. Maybe "explode" is the wrong word as it will take place over a year or so, but it will go up to that and more with ease, and with the kind of market volume that would make 2013 look like a lemonade stand.

It didn't crash, it went on sale for a while for some steady hands to be back in and bring it up again.

Collisions will never happen in the lifetime of the solar system. I'm not sure why people think otherwise. From a physics standpoint,  all the atom's of a one hundred dollar bill has a higher odd of teleporting from your wallet to a strangers than one address being collided.

This absolutely should be done. It would definitly prove that bitcoin is not susceptable to government intervention, and make it very popular. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:50:27
Proof or you're just a liar. Also, complaining is not appropriate here.

Short of a quantum attack, bitcoin will never be worthless. The good new is we will have plenty of warning on that, so there is time to switch all bitcoin value to a new system. People think altcoins are bad. While they are needlessly distracting today, they have already shown this transition to a new algorithm is possible. Bitcoin has nowhere to go but up.

Yeah, and if you wanted to send a penny by mail it would cost 50 cents. 
If you wanted to use a credit card for a penny it would cost at least a dollar in swipe fees. 
The flaw with this divisibility is because of a well ingrained flaw with fiat, it costs money to use it, and this crossover between currencies will not be resolved with fiat still being a major player. 
Once people think globally with bitcoin, there will be many businesses that will allow free micro transactions for the spirit of good will. The thought process is that with its deflationary nature a small transaction today could be worth a few bucks, it would be good for a business to use because then they could invest back into bitcoin in a major way. Then this problem will be resolved, so don't worry about it. Until then, perhaps your thoughts may be worth more than a penny.

Fixed that for you.
