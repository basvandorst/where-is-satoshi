Maybe I'm wrong, but how could this happen? I though that the difficult is so high that the block will take long and therefore be very big.

So if the difficult in BCHC (Bitcoin Cash Classic) would be suddenly higher than all wallets would point to this? This sounds a little crazy, dosn't it?

Didn't JP say, that he'll fire anyone that will trade with bitcoin in his firm?
Will he just firs himself or the rest of his firm, too?

Well, the number can always drop about 20% if there are not 6(?) blocks in 6(?) hours. Miners are often stopping to mine to continue later and produce up to 60 blocks each minute.
Yeah, you read that right. In the time you could get 12.5 BTC they can get  7,500 BCH. Considering this, the price is still much too high.

Kindly point me to a cellphone that can run core full node. Unless you find one we have to stay with a SPV wallet on our phone.

Since the price is now 5300 you are not part of the club where you can talk about when you bought bitcoin low and could now sell for a profit.

Too bad. I wanted to visit them the next time I'm in Prague. But if they are so much against bitcoin, I'll just skip my visit there.

Excuse me what kind of statement is this? They are delaying the payment for DAYS because of a lie and promise that it will be only 14 hours before the fork there.
What about people that need there money now or can't access their bitcoin in this 14 hours, they could miss quite an opportunity.
Beside the fact that the promise of a liar isn't that much worth, is it?
