Genuine question: how and why do people fake volume? Who is doing this? Do we have any proof?
@_date: 2014-11-05 15:45:40
I've noticed this too, but wouldn't people just send the name number of transactions but in higher amounts of the price decline were the driver? I wish blockchain gave more information on how its USD estimate was calculated.

Thanks for doing this. Electrum is my client of choice. It may not be the prettiest but it just feels solid to me. 
Obviously I wouldn't be able to use it without people running servers.

Did you make this yourself? Do you have instructions for repeating this? I hate relying on blockchains numbers. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 14:17:41
This is a fair point. Not nothing, but surely you agree financial system got less than they would have had I used credit. And I do disagree that it would be impossible for Overstock's venders or suppliers to one day accept bitcoin, closing the loop.

Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:49:29
Completely agreed. Before they took bitcoin, I donated in USD and asked politely that they accept bitcoin. Now that they take bitcoin, I donated in bitcoin and thanked them politely for taking bitcoin.
It's really simple.

I have a few objections to calling these transactions fake. One, there might be some legitimate use that we just aren't aware of. I heard someone mentioned a mixing service at some point.
Two, I tend to think that any transaction that someone pays a fee for is a real transaction that adds value to the bitcoin network. If someone pays an ATM fee to take money out of one ATM and deposits it back in the ATM across the street, the bank is still making money.
Three, it could be an automated program. I think one of bitcoin's great strengths is that it is as easily accessible to programs and artificial intelligences as it is to humans. We may need to accept that we won't understand why the computers do what they do all the time. I sure as hell don't understand some of the automated HTTP requests I see in my web site's logs, but those robots are doing something of value for someone.
That said, you're probably right. Someone probably is trying to artificially inflate the transaction count. I'm just not as confident as you are.
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:25:08
Very interesting!! Obviously Bermuda is the Bitcoin capital of the world. 
On a slightly unrelated note, do you have any thoughts on whether the increase in transaction rate over the past six months correlates to an increase in value transacted over the network? As opposed to just more small transactions?
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:53:46
Hey I had nothing but good experiences with bitstamp.

I always thought b2b is a huge opportunity for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:03:51
Also a new records for [number of transactions per day excluding chains longer than 100]( Though I still think those long chains should count for something.
@_date: 2016-01-03 22:35:52
I appreciate these articles because I'm always trying to get a better idea of whether or not bitcoin is growing and if so at what rate.
However, I'm not sure I agree with the writing off of long-chain transactions. The author disregards them because they are "comprised of spam, wallet shuffling, coin mixing, mining payouts, faucets, etc". Is that true? Also, people are doing things like mixing and shuffling precisely because they are using bitcoin. Why go to all that trouble if you're not going to use the coins (even if it's just as a store of value)?
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:29:35
Sure. You could do it by hand too.

These usually get revised down as the day goes on. Looks like it's already below the sept 2015 peak.
But if the trend continues, it won't be long now before we beat that sept 2015 peak.

That's a good point. I'll try to make it clearer. There is an option to have the bucket close automatically if it hits zero, but it would be helpful to indicate failed drips
@_date: 2012-12-02 15:52:06
Yeah I agree. But also consider the difference in number of people that probably visit eBay compared with Bitmit. 
@_date: 2012-01-27 16:31:17
How much time are you giving it? For some reason the bitcoin client takes a long time to connect on my mac
@_date: 2012-12-15 19:24:00
I don't see why only taking bitcoin is a selling point. It seriously limits your market. Why not take credit card too and maybe only issue refunds in bitcoin or something.

I'm also an attorney. For those who are wondering, clerking in federal appellate court is impressive and probably indicates that OP attended a very good law school and was at least in the top 25% percent of his or her class (but probably higher).
Doesn't speak much to experience actually practicing law but would certainly require excellent legal research skills.
Questions for OP:
Are you subscribed or do you have access to any legal research service? Obviously, it's not strictly necessary as much is available online for free, but it's certainly helpful.
Have you thought at all about the ethical considerations of giving legal advice over the internet? I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm just saying you might want to carefully set up the ground rules before you start giving advice.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:36:13
I understand the savings there, but they can always do separate credit card and bitcoin prices. Gas stations by me do a lower cash price and higher credit price. There's also savings to be had from the volume of transactions.
Edit: Don't take my criticism as wishing against them. I'm just worried they won't be able to cut it do to lack of demand like BitMuchies a few months back.
@_date: 2012-03-24 19:05:53
Some interesting stuff in there. I would love to see some numbers on Bitmit's growth.
@_date: 2012-02-13 22:52:41
Great news! I know there are other similar services in other cities. Maybe, if this is successful, they can be convinced to accept Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2012-02-01 01:42:57
Also, it's been my experience that getinfo/listtransactions won't show a reflect transactions until there's at least 1 confirmation

you could think about trading entire wallets on usb sticks or maybe giving out instawallet addresses. There may be a way to rig a setup where you could get a text message on the prepaid phone if a certain address receives a transfer

One more question. Do I need to keep the client running and Internet connected to recieve money or will it show up when I load up the client?
@_date: 2011-08-16 15:55:43
Very cool. I've been wondering lately whether btc transaction volume has been increasing or decreasing.

@_date: 2015-03-01 16:08:26
Electrum 2.0 includes support through a plugin for broadcasting transactions over audio. I'll never use it but I think it's very cool.
Electrum is my client of choice. Can't wait to try this out, though I'll give it a few months to shake out the bugs before I actually start using it for real. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 03:53:40
Did anyone else actually try to verify this? I got bad signature :( but I may be doing something wrong as I'm new to this.

@_date: 2011-12-31 02:02:50
Thanks for the feedback.
Since it's it the testing phase, there are no user stories yet, but hopefully there will be soon. I'll be glad to add some of the envisioned uses to the site though.
As far as my professional legal opinion goes, the answer is I don't have one. For me to do legal analysis of Bitcoin in general, or my site specifically would take a significant amount of research and might involve me retaining a more knowledgeable lawyer of my own.
For the security issue, I agree with you completely but there really is only so much I can do. I don't believe in security through obscurity so I thought it best to let everyone know what I was running. However, the general idea for gaining trust would be to become properly insured thereby giving people someone to sue if I lost their money. ;-)
Thanks again for testing it out!
@_date: 2011-12-29 22:47:30
Thanks for checking it out. I'll look into adding a monthly option. I had originally decided against it b/c a month isn't a fixed length of time, but I don't see why I couldn't implement it.
To have money sent immediately, all you need to do is set the spill address to where you want the money to go and close the bucket. Everything will be sent to the spill address. In the alternative, you could set up a 30 second spout to send some very large amount of money to an address.
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:35:35


How do I know?
Often when I have professional services I usually have no idea whether or not they were done well or crappily. I guess if things go south, at least I can request that the professional fixes it or issues a refund and if that doesn't work I can complain to an authority or even sue.
What the computers could do however, is have a trust system much like you see on darkmarkets or ebay. That way a mechanic would be incentivized into doing work properly.

This looks incredible. Honestly I would use this often if I had access to one. My biggest concern would be the security of the box itself though. Also, couldn't people produce fakes?

I really hope they launch soon. I really think ATMs will make getting bitcoin much easier. I know I'll use bitcoin much more once one of these hits NYC.
@_date: 2013-06-01 00:16:29
Delivery was quick. Everything was well packed. Shipping took a while, but that's cause I selected the cheapest option.
Best of all, the banks and the credit card companies didn't get a cent!
@_date: 2013-03-04 13:45:36
I've been waiting for this. Also think about bets on speed run times or races. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:01:26
Glad to see them back up.
@_date: 2013-01-04 21:15:16
I'd imagine someone like memory dealers already does a lot of shipping. Also, there are other office supplies besides paper.
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:56:34
Same with me (and I think the vast majority), but just cause it hasn't happened, doesn't mean it cant. Now is the time to add extra security, before something does go wrong. Or put it all in correct horse battery staple.
@_date: 2013-09-11 02:44:00
This is fantastic! The way I see it, it's like the web. Ending IE dominance and having multiple capable browsers improved the web greatly. Hopefully having multiple bitcoin implementations will improve bitcoin just as much.

Wow I'm surprised at the positive reaction. It must be good. 
For my part, I don't understand it and change scares me.
