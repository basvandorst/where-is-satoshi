*All* orders for 506.23 should've been filled before the price fell below that to 500.

No.  Read up on [mining](  The computations it's doing are what makes the blockchain and bitcoin work.
edit:  Also, the vast majority of the bitcoin mining power is coming from ASICs which are built to handle the specific type of math Bitcoin mining requires.  Pretty sure it doesn't do the math that folding requires.

Let me ask you this, if you'd bought and the price had gone up, would you make a thread asking how to refund coinbase their extra money?
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:16:31
Could you define 'large' in this context?  Or is it relative to the amount of money you have in the account?

I was trying to think of a hipster joke involving Portlandia and BTC.  But tnothing is there.

People have asked me about BTC a few times recently.  I'm kind of the tech-centric guy in my group of friends and co-workers.  I explained in like 1 BTC was a Brick of gold, and they could buy Bars or Coins or Chips of smaller demoninations.

iPhone app + Starbucks accepting BTC could be the *to the moon* thing.

Coinbase is the easiest site to use, but it takes 2+ business days to get an account validated through them.  I assume most other exchanges have a similar set-up.

It's a question of staffing.  Extreme growth in a short period of time isn't something most businesses can adapt to easily.  Throw in the technical challenges associated with BTC and the problem only increases.

Considering how long it actually takes them to make episodes of The Simpsons, this is interesting.  I seem to remember an AMA from a writer on the show saying it was a few months from script to air.

Considering that the iPhone market share is something in the neighborhood of 30%, I think it would be a great thing to have a good BTC app for it.  If the goal is to get more people using BTC, a simple straight-forward iPhone app would go a long way.

This is Youtube comment thread level of nonsense.

True, but tying what is a truly international (post-national?) currency until to a variety of national currencies doesn't seem like it's a great thing.
Plus the whole 'averaging several currencies' thing doesn't make sense to me.  They only have value compared to each other, I don't think you can average them in any meaningful way.

Most of them will convert to fiat in order to keep their businesses running.  I doubt very many of them can pay suppliers or restock their inventories with BTC.
But it's still a great day for BTC.  Proving the commercial use is a good thing.

Because all currencies fluctuate.  USD/EUR/YEN are all in a constant state of change.  1USD does not equal the same amount of EUR as it did 1 hour or 1 day ago.  The swings aren't as large as USD/BTC, but there are still changes.

Really really low.
edit:  This math was wrong.  But still: really really really low.

That just means that the **names** Bitcion, mBTC, and Satoshi are made up.  Their value is still going to be same relative to each other.


Right, and what does that have to do with fixing the value of  a Bitcoin to a set of currencies that fluctuate as often as BTC does?
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:13:24
Which is another difference between Tulips and BTC.  BTC can be usefully divided into smaller pieces.

About .25 BTC.
