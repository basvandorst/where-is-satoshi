It's amazing how people still use dollar value at the BTC sub.

I have actually studied economics and I'm well aware off the whole system that started with Rothschild brothers founding national banks in Europe through lending gold etc. I'm not denying how made up current system is. I just asked a few questions which you have deflected.

Buys BTC with fiat money, gets paid by fiat, still thinks BTC is a new paradigm shift... *sigh*

Since we are cutting the middle man, the government and banks, who is going to build infrastructure and provide services? Then who's going to loan "money" when someone wants to start a business or buy a house for example? Please do enlighten me

I thought the whole point of bitcoin was to have all the money accounted for and on a public ledger. During the days of gold as a currency, gold traders/smiths started issuing "bank"notes as they stored people's gold. After a while they realized that not everyone asked for their gold so they would "loan" people gold for interest. In other words their reserves were a fraction of the outstanding notes out in existence. The whole point of bitcoin is to stop this practice of issuing notes and printing money. So that can't work. OR what's the point of switching to a crytocurrency.

no but you can still technically call it bitcoin or even satoshi.

HODLing and spending are the exact opposites, you do understand that right?

That is an issue.

They forked from the same code, good luck with that on any legal basis.

The moment any of them are found to have sold their Bcash, their case will fall apart.

As far as I know BCH was forked and distributed to all the existing bitcoin owners at the time. Some BTC people chose to sell theirs and made money from it. As long as there is support from miners, I don't see why two or more can't exist. I don't believe it's a scam. It's not like he can print BCH for himself out of nowhere. Everyone is in it for the money and he is trying hard to establish Bcash fork to be the main branch like any entrepreneur would.

I'm not vested in either. Just making an objective remark.

I don't see anything wrong with that comment. Every fork is potentially the real bitcoin. It's all about public perception and he is trying to create that. It's not misleading. It's just marketing. There is no false claim.

Bcash and Bitconnect are totally different products by design.

A new account hardly means a noob. I'm not Satoshi but I have been lurking since 2010-11, which is long before your reddit birthday.
