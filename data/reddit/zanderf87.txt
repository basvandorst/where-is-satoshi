Probably close to a dozen now. Support JUST responded, and after a canned response have yet to actually address the problem.
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:31:05
It's awesome for now, but I actually would kind of like to see it go the way of Facebook. Same with how we refer to quantities of Bitcoin. I think we should drop the 's'. I have 17 Bitcoin. Something about it sounds better. Multiples cheapens it in a way I can't describe. Maybe I'm just crazy.
Edit: I don't actually have 17 Bitcoin. That would be very nice.

I find a small amount of irony (I always use that word wrong, I'm sure) in the fact that everyone was hailing Avalon as the company to order ASICs from, since they were sure to deliver despite being much more pricey. Now BFL is *actually* delivering.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:50:05
Yes I agree. I find that the more likely outcome, but it is an interesting situation to ponder. Completely new conceptual territory I feel. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:01:23
Now we just have to see if Roman truly delivers. I'm optimistic, but am still bracing myself for the worst.
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:57:47
The other problem for him is he's right about one thing. We do want an ethereal "benevolent tyrant" as the ruler of our currency. It *is* mathematics because it is the purest expression of an idea. Humans have a fascinating habit of creating the gods of their ancestors. Now anyone can be Hermes for the price of a plane ticket. This is no different. Bitcoin faces many challenges, but the mathematics and open source code are what makes this a potential game changer.

To be honest, I didn't read OP's text fully. So let's see what the $500 thing is about...
Ah yes, the $500 proposal has no more merit than mine if I were to say it's true market value is $10,000,000,000.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:51:44
Yes, it is still somewhat strange to consider that as popular as Bitcoin has become, 99% of the world doesn't even know what it is or how it works. The speed at which things progress these days is fascinating, and I'm only 25.

@_date: 2013-04-04 01:30:19
Because the value of the money they put in: $100 is still what they will have available to them. It just looks funny because it'll look like less than a bitcoin. You'll still be able to buy ~$100 worth of stuff. That's why people will use it. This is assuming the value of their money doesn't plummet dramatically. I'm assuming a stable value (crazy to assume at the moment, I know)
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:30:41
Remind them that they don't have to buy one whole Bitcoin. All they have to buy is a piece of the growth that everyone is experiencing.

Certainly possible, but I wanted to provide a counter-argument to the hysteria that seems to pervade r/bitcoin regarding the gov't preparing to wage an all out war on Bitcoin. It's a persecution complex, in my mind. But hey, it's just an opinion, man.

@_date: 2013-05-20 23:02:23
MPESA is the de facto payment system in developing continents like Africa. It currently costs anywhere from 10-26% to perform a transaction on that network using SMS. Bitcoin has the same capability with none of the transaction cost. You just need the infrastructure and adoption. This is my floor. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:42:45
Not really: "accepts...from one person" means they're accepting it from someone. When a miner succeeds in solving a new block, they're not accepting it from a person. They receive it as part of the protocol, which is obviously not a person. The rest is moot as a result of this. By your interpretation, we're all money transmitters, not just the miners as long as we're sending the BTC to someone else.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:16:29
Good thing you checked to see if I have a job. I leave it open on one monitor during my workday.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:30:52
I hadn't considered that, but it completely makes sense. We need DDoS resistant exchanges (actually resistant, not on-paper resistant) and a much larger market cap. Only way to achieve that is to kick out the day traders and speculators and allow the believers to buy, hold and use.

Thanks for the investment advice trusted friend! Putting in sell orders now! /s
C'mon dude. There are newbies on here who very well might actually follow this kind of advice. Don't listen to this crap people. Sell if you like, but not because some guy on reddit said "hackers and scammers" are manipulating the market.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:07:53
Terror only works on those who have a short-term mentality. I am riding Bitcoin into one of two places. The ground, or the stratosphere. No sell orders here, not for at least a few years anyways.
Can't say I blame them, but really these people must feel at least a little dirty typing that FUD into Reddit. It's even cheaper than a DDoS against Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2013-05-28 22:39:42
Really appreciate that effort. The person you want to reach out to is actually a user called AudenX. She's been the superhero out of all of this. You can reach her by finding her on Reddit, or her Reddit/Bitfloor-specific email address here: reddit

Wow thank you my first ever BTC tip! I agree, Bitcoin will certainly have political ramifications, but that's just not what I see in it. It's the frictionless, instant, empowering nature of it that I am drawn to.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:29:39
I agree that's a very reasonable deadline. I'm afraid that even though my relatively small amount $750, would be lost, but at least a punitive message would be sent to this asshat of a business owner.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:16:07
That's a fair point, but I'd like to posit that most participants of all major exchanges look to Mt. Gox for pricing sentiment. Just my two cents though.

Risk is only how much skin you place in the game. With LTC I currently have none. I will continue to have none until I see a market that uses Litecoin like BTC has. Bitcoin gained real value because it was the currency of the site Silk Road. I understand Atlantis is up now, but again these are all copy cats. 
If LTC becomes the Pepsi to BTCs Coke so be it, but I'll still be standing here calling it for what it is. A knock-off with more sugar added.
Your analysis was solid, but really it boils down to a prediction. Your prediction is as good as mine. I have no idea what will happen to it. At this point it stands to be that Pepsi. Until another coin comes along and litecoins the litecoin. You're a smart guy so I'll assume you know what I mean by that ;-).

Haha claim chowder. Very nice.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:16:39
"strengthened and diversified"
That's entirely fair. Greater participants in mining strengthens the network. No arguments there. You're also right that time is money. What you're missing is that the person who tweaked the time per block to 2.5 minutes was making a choice in a zero sum game. You either have greater reliability of the blockchain with longer block creation times, or you have lower reliability with lower block creation times. LTC is not able to scale to the level many people hope BTC reaches. The moment people are able to bring down confirmation times for BTC without sacrificing reliability, is the moment the last bastion for LTC goes out the door.
You're right. Time is money, and time for LTC is running out. LTC cannot scale without the very thing that would make BTC render LTC obsolete.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:11:43

Maybe I should have made it a little more clear, but for any situation like this, it's always up to your best judgement. The purpose of this post was for people who experience situations where they feel the request isn't appropriate.
Edit: Also you should check out the book "If you give a mouse a cookie." Not saying that applies to every situation, but it can be a very slippery slope if one isn't mindful.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:18:38
Yes. Automation would be critical. Additionally, being able to guarantee that the results will be tax compliant would be extremely valuable. A CPA responded a little while ago about it being an enormous headache. 
I think that although it would be a mountain of a task, if it's daunting to a CPA, it would be all that more valuable of a product. Unfortunately it's just not necessary at the moment, and won't be in the near-middle term due to the volatility we're experiencing.

Yeah but it wasn't all that technical, and a fair amount of time was spent explaining what Bitcoin is and how it works. Chris Larsen definitely plugged Ripple whenever he got a chance, but it didn't detract from the discussion.

Genuine question. What new rules? I thought the money transmitter rule was pretty standard.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:34:27

How long do miners for LTC expect to continue to stay profitable?
@_date: 2013-05-30 00:31:38
Oh very interesting. I hadn't considered that particular viewpoint. Now, if the miner is simply confirming the transaction, why are they a transmitter? Aren't they only verifying the transaction record? Or is the main point simply that the interpretation can be easily made by the gov't?
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:28:28
Thanks! Good points are what I'm looking for.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:57:16
That's what I'm saying. Even litecoin is experiencing rapidly diminishing returns. What you're describing was his plan from the beginning.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:20:59
No, but I can imagine a mixed situation. How about cutting out the fees for a transfer of a down payment? 20% down payment on a $500k house (so cheap it doesn't really exist where I live in Silicon Valley) is $100k. 3% fee on that (which I think is on the cheaper side) would be $3k. That's a nice chunk of change right there.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:26:51
Haha thank you. I wasn't trying to break any rules, and I apologize for not being more observant of them.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:30:20
I *think* this one includes the fees. Could be wrong though.
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:53:23

@_date: 2013-04-07 23:44:42
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like one of the most critical features of this program is to ensure it's tax code compliant. Make sure it calculates and maybe even pays (in USD) the established taxes for companies that pay their taxes in USD. This would be an enormous step for Bitcoin if people were receiving at least part of their paycheck in BTC.  
However, I don't think we are very close to seeing that become practical due to the volatility we're experiencing. Seems like a good chance to see where the puck is going! Or to get hip-checked by fickle lady fate.

@_date: 2013-04-26 02:11:42
"and faster transaction times doesn't count."
Amen, friend. Amen. What a lot of people don't realize is that although it is currently not practical to use BTC for POS, the longer confirmation times are there for a *good reason*. Satoshi didn't just say to him/her/themself, "you know what? let's just not make it instant. Let those silly bitches wait a while for their transaction."

FUCK. OFF.
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:05:06
Would you say the biggest main reason is simply early adopter advantage? Additionally, the higher fluctuations are due to lower market cap, so $100 has greater impact on LTC market than BTC? Seems more like differentiations due to temporal/participation differences rather than an intended effect of the protocol itself.
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:48:07

I watched all yesterday as large buy transactions were regularly performed, and then all at once in the evening (PST) dozens of even larger sells were performed all at once. This dropped the value from $95 to $90 in a matter of seconds. Definitely a pump and dump.

@_date: 2013-07-19 23:14:03
Yeah they're instant for me now too, but this one purchase I made before reaching level 2 has become an enormous thorn in my side. I'm guessing the same for Coinbase, as Olaf said he escalated it to an engineer. I do have to give them props for polite, (relatively) quick response.
@_date: 2013-05-07 04:53:12
Yeah, really your best choice is to do a wire from your bank account. I do the Bitinstant to mt. gox because the liquor store 200 yards away from my house does moneygram lol.
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:56:06
Exactly. People later to the game than the early miners want their own cut. Fair enough I suppose, but doesn't speak at all towards the merits of LTC.

Additional relevant Louis C.K. clip: 
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:22:32
Competition is good. And I agree the market should decide the winner. I'm just way too wary of investing in a crypto that has a decidedly higher risk of accidentally forking (and thus causing a crash due to everyone losing confidence) when it reaches global acceptance. That fact alone may be the reason why some (many?) don't accept it in the first place. Bitcoin offers people a chance to send large amounts of money without having to pay banks transfer fees. Anyone with a brain is happy to wait the extra hour if it meant the $10 million they sent is 100% safe. 
Litecoin currently has the advantage for POS purchases (if you can even really call that an advantage with 2.5 minutes), but the market saturation for litecoin is laughable compared to Bitcoin. And that's saying something because the market saturation for Bitcoin is even more laughable compared to USD.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:07:25
I'd be worried too. Sounds like Roman is making sure everything is looking kosher while the money is put into another bank account. I imagine there are some rather upset high-rollers waiting on their money at the moment.

@_date: 2013-05-07 04:36:26
Yeah no problem. You may want to consider setting up a mt gox account. You pay an additional premium when you do BTC to wallet address, I discovered. Sending the money to a mt. gox account allows you to convert it yourself. I found when I purchased 2.3 BTC at what I thought was 144, I was actually purchasing at $155 in addition to the fees they tell you.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:21:19
Reasonable commentary from MOLDY_QUEEF_BARF. Luckily I too am under $1k in holdings there: "pending" and on hold. That's also what I'm thinking. Once the money is electronically liquid again, we'll be set loose. Only after BTC has tripled in price though... :-/
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:46:07
Businesses should always be subject to regulation. That's just my own view, but I think you're missing the point. Bitcoin should stay unregulated because it is beholden to no country. Businesses have "homes" in countries, and even internet-based ones must register to at least a nationality. 
Bitfloor is no different. It entered into an agreement with its customers, and is failing to complete its part of the agreement by returning funds given in good faith.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:29:48
Aside from last nights huge jump, I agree the growth has been much more sustainable. A pang of fear strikes my heart when I consider that we may never see double digit prices for Bitcoin again. Good thinking on playing with a smaller portion of your holdings. I don't have enough liquid/time to do that during the day, so I'm relegated to buying low when I see an opportunity (as rare as that is) and holding.

The credibility is very real. I find it about as credible as BTC. That's the problem. It's so similar. If an altcoin had the ability to confirm transactions orders of magnitude faster than BTC (don't know if this is even possible) then that would be a very distinct advantage. That would be the game changer in my book. Same security, nearly instantaneous proof of transaction.

You're probably right. More eyeballs more potential buyers

Not sure if trying to prove OP has nothing left to go on, or is LTC enthusiast...

Just a theory, but what if the title is meant to draw in those that don't believe in BTC, for the wrong reasons? They would believe the article would validate their misgivings against it, and then as they go through the article, find themselves with more faith in its future. Interesting little manipulative technique.

Thank you for bringing up the one point I had in the back of my mind. For most people it *is* going to take years for their balances to realize into life-changing fortunes. I was posting in the hopes of placing a thought in their mind that has a chance to become permanent. For those who have the very long term in mind, this is something that could be helpful/effective.
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:22:28
Let's be honest though. If you're investing in Bitcoin, you're at least *partially* the betting type.
@_date: 2013-04-27 06:09:32
Yeah I definitely have no idea what the actual Satoshi wanted, it was more of a topical thing to propose. Nothing serious ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:31:27
I mean in regards to when we can expect our money. If a check has been received. Anything.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:29:36
Also good, but I like the fact that this one displays the price in the tab so I can keep it open.
Disclaimer: This isn't my app, so I gain nothing from supporting it.
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:21:08
Seems legit.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:44:24
A valuable distinction nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:00:14
Yes I suppose you're right. Although if you would indulge me in a hypothetical for a moment:
What if the way we look at Bitcoin is only as a result of having been exposed to the dollar and similar currencies for so long? I would reason that if Bitcoin does become a mainstream currency, that the people who are just children now, would have no problem viewing Bitcoin in the way it is meant to be viewed.
By that I mean they see each zero after the decimal point as a step towards the accepted common denomination equivalent to $1. Less steps, more money. Kinda like seeing the commas and zeros in $1,000,000 for us.
Does that make sense? It's been a long day unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:51:00
"with significant improvements adding real value."
Dude, seriously? At least try to pretend like you're not invested in litecoin enough to appear objective. Not even close
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:18:45
Feel free to give up. About as close as it gets to deserving to lose your money. I however am holding out, and will be watching this situation closely. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:14:14
I guess I mean it's much harder to find the culprit. Are the odds realistic in cases like these that someone will be apprehended?
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:31:26
I agree politics has it's place and purpose when needing to view Bitcoin from all of it's requisite angles. I suppose what is grating about what is presented here on this sub, is the aggressive projection of a person's ideology onto Bitcoin. Maybe it's impossible not to completely remove yourself from it, but I would bet that often the political posters aren't realistic about the effects Bitcoin will have in our lifetimes.
This is really only worth as much as the next person's argument, though. I just got that feeling many others on this sub felt in a similar way.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:50
Sounds a little conspiracy-ey. But this is definitely intentional nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-06-04 23:03:06
A fair assessment but its not so much about having to see/ignore them, but more so about the said undesired posts taking up space for other posts. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 05:57:15
Yeah the meetup was great! Really informative. I was the guy with the decentralized exchange question. They were really good at explaining themselves during each question. Wasn't so sure what the guy asking about other disruptive technologies was getting at though.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:54:46
Ah yes, can't believe I didn't consider those who are locked in cold-storage. Thanks for ending my proposed debate so effectively (seriously).
@_date: 2013-06-27 23:32:02
I don't normally call people names, but you're a moron. It says "FOR OSX/MAC" in the title. "run it on our pc". YOU get lost, dick.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:58:10
Does someone have a translated transcript?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:13:25
Not trying to be mean, but I think you underestimate how many people get into Bitcoin purely for the speculative purpose. When their investment starts to dwindle and even go red, their survival mechanism kicks in.
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:06:31
"One of the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges, Bitfloor, was shut down in April, after it was attacked."
That's not why it was shut down. That's enough outta you, mister.

HP and Dell both make PCs, but they have real differentiation in things like customer service, aesthetic design (not commenting on the quality) and other real, tangible things. So what value is there in a nearly exact clone? And furthermore, the differences that are there, are either at LTCs disadvantage, or are able to be acquired by BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:01:16
Faster processing speed because of 2.5 minute blocks only restricts the ability of LTC to scale. Increased chance of accidental forking. It was a short term, quick-and-dirty way to latch onto BTC. I'm not hating on it because it's a bad idea. I'm hating on it because people are propping it up as a legitimate alt-coin. It's not. It brings nothing new to the table, except for the washing you mentioned.
Also, I hope you've got a sick LTC mining rig set up, because when ASICs hit the BTC market, there's gonna be a flood of GPU miners switching from mining BTC to LTC, causing a mt. everest-sized spike in difficulty.
@_date: 2013-05-24 04:24:07
Of course, I wouldn't even be aggressive. Unfortunately I have no real way of knowing exactly where he was so a true confrontation isn't in the cards at the moment. In the face of this, I try to take small consolation in the fact that he hasn't gone completely dark. This alone gives me hope enough that he isn't cutting and running.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:24:47
A more intelligent and audacious clone of the earlier post to "SELL NOW, HACKERS MANIPULATORS OMG". I'll be here a while folks. Sell if you like, but don't listen to strangers who stand to profit greatly by spreading FUD.
Edit: Thank you for placing a disclaimer. I retract my accusation of a clone, and will have the previous text stand for clarity.
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:34:56
I definitely felt a tug at my logic when referring to those last two aspects of btc. Finance and philosophy are well-intertwined with politics, but still are able to stand exclusively of each other at the end of the day. I wouldn't even mind topical discussions of the political ramifications of btc either. The crazy just gets a little loud in here too often, recently. IMO anyways.
@_date: 2013-04-30 00:21:56
So looking at the empirical data, including increasing difficulty, how long would you say it would take my friend to pay off his $3k miner?
Edit: He said he was looking at 600 K/Hs
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:52:52
Yes yes you're all very excited over there on r/litecoin. Mt. Gox acceptance =/= guarantee of merchant acceptance. Let's talk once miners agree the tweaks can't be made to BTC protocol to render Litecoin obsolete.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:12:56
Oh wow I love the green one. Set as wallpaper! Thanks OPs! (insert something about a bundle of sticks)
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:22:09
I'm really glad you joined the conversation. This has been the most enlightening of any of the responses. I can't say I'm a believer, but you can believe my opinion has shifted much closer towards acceptance of LTC!
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:17:55
And even then, that will only strengthen the network. It won't necessarily make anything better for LTC outside of that.
@_date: 2013-07-05 22:29:41
has become something of an echo chamber for political ideology. If you want to look for the intended purpose, you should check out Satoshi's own commentary. 
I'm not aware of it, but what I do know, is that it's meant to be a tool. It just gained notoriety amongst anti-government types for the opportunities it offered. 
Businesses are held to a different standard than a protocol. You would go after the person peddling child porn on the internet, not the internet, for an extreme example.

Bro, seriously there are at least 2 grave errors I see here. One, is buying on ebay. Don't do that. Two, you sent money to SR the VERY DAY after DPR is finally able to possibly get it back up following a massive attack on the site itself. 
C'mon man. This has got to be the best PSA for "ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
