Except nothing about what they're doing is a crime, there's no minor exemption, but a major process through which they have to go through to have the right to seize property

It proves that they followed a procedure which is backed and based on the tenets of legality. 
If you believe the status quo is in the wrong, you have the burden of proof to show how. You have not even touched that. You have the burden of proof, not me, yet I believe I've still fulfilled mine without you even contesting.

There's absolutely no question that he was breaking the law.
The processes for criminal trials and asset seizures are not the same. They received a warrant for seizure.
You don't have to go to trial to be held in a jail cell, have your car impounded, or receive a speeding ticket. By your claims, a speeding ticket is just the government stealing money- social contract theory justifies the FBI's seizure of the property in question.

You have failed in all aspects to prove that what the United States government is doing is criminal by any definition of the word 'criminal', much less even try. If you want to prove that the mechanism through which the FBI seized the coins is legally invalid, be my guest. I'm fully expecting you to, considering you've had such a tantrum building up to it.

DEFINITION; criminal:  involving illegal activity : relating to crime
your accusation that the U.S. government's actions were 'criminal' is most fluidly interpreted as 'the u.s. government's actions involved illegal activity'. if you meant 'the u.s. government's actions are morally wrong', you used a wildly incorrect word.


i could just as easily call your points an appeal to novelty, but the fact is, if you raise the original accusation that something the U.S. government is doing is illegal than I'd sure hope you could at least back those accusations up with something at all
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:38:33
Phrasing, goddammit. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:26:14
It's entirely legal.




The initial burden of proof in a judicial action is also probable cause. After seizure, the USA’s office must make an independent determination of whether the property can be forfeited. After finding the forfeiture action has merit, a verified complaint must be filed, in effect, charging the property with violating the law. The burden is then on the government to prove the property is subject to forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. Preponderance of the evidence is defined as “superior evidentiary weight that, though sufficient to free the mind wholly from all reasonable doubt, is still sufficient to incline a fair and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than the other.”

Perhaps if you'd actually respond to the point I made regarding procedure of asset seizure &amp; forfeiture instead of just saying 'hurbadurbadur crimnul' we could have a decent discussion.


The issue is that **you haven't proven** that what the U.S. government is doing is illegal. You haven't even TRIED. Nor have you responded to my point that seizure was based off of quantitative and qualitative measures, and passed through a judge whose job it is to interpret the laws.

this is a discussion about prosecution and procedure under the CURRENT law, not what the law should be. hypotheticals and hopes don't change the fact of the matter that the FBI *enforces current law*, not determines what those laws are.
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:55:59
Liqor isn't illegal, drugs are.
If you disagree with drug laws, whatever, that's not the debate- the point is that they weren't societally-upstanding businessmen, they were breaking the law, and the government has the right to seize proceeds involved in illegal activity.

That's a general procedure document, location of the property pertains to general situations, not this particular scenario, although it still applies here, because they were clearly able to obtain the BTC through his organization. They're just saying it's something to consider.


What's the difference? The entire purpose of the private key is to obtain the BTC. If a bank robber kept gold bars in a storeroom, and they seized the key to open the storeroom, you wouldn't expect them to simply walk away after finding the actual target. 


The fifth amendment protects against self incrimination. It's unlikely that he himself gave access to the BTC, it was almost surely done through a judicial warrant, which the fifth amendment does not apply to. The fourth protects from unreasonable search and seizure, but this was not unreasonable.


This doesn't matter here. The criminal organization in question derived value from and operated using the bitcoin, therefore it was subject to seizure (and resale). Bitcoin is revolutionary, no doubt, but SilkRoad used it as a measure and store of value, as do many others within our society. The way it works doesn't change the fact that it is a currency, and that individuals derive value from it.

So if the government found a bank account number with illicitly acquired currency in it, they shouldn't touch it? Because the number isn't the same thing as the cash within?


They did, to a judge, in order to acquire the original warrant for seizure. 
The Silk Road is clearly a drug operation. There's no doubt about it. It is currency obtained through illegal means. I don't know why the Bitcoin community is defending them in this light, either, they're a stain on the currency's reputation.


The properties of money are (a), a store of value, (b), a medium of exchange, and (c), a unit of account. The Silk Road was using them for all three of these purposes. It doesn't matter if it's classified as currency. The FBI can seize a car, a boat, artifacts, etc, so long as the subject of value was used to facilitate criminal activity, and they can do whatever they wish with it after seizure.

I did. I presented the procedure for asset seizure, and the exact process through which the FBI legally seized and sold the coins. That was my proof, proof of legality. But if you're arguing against the status quo it's essentially your job to prove that the status quo is wrong, and the closest you've gotten to that point is vague accusations of criminalism.
