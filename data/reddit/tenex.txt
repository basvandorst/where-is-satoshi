This logo makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. You could remove the word 'Bitcoin' and replace it with whatever brand name you'd like. Perhaps it would be more suitable for an architecture firm, or a 3D printing technology. Bitcoin has nothing to do with being in flux, it has to do with being distributed and decentralized. Complete fail.

Wow, this whole big block/little block debate really mirrors the worst part of politics, making your opposition into your enemy. With zero hard proof, you've been convinced that other side isn't just "wrong", they're paid shills, part of a conspiracy to destroy bitcoin. Both sides are guilty of this, and I find it pathetic. Let's all take off the tin hats and be a little more logical about this.

More like hijacked, muzzled, split in two, and left to the wolves. I think that once the Core/Classic Civil War is over, it'll get back to being a productive place to discuss Bitcoin. Until then, both of the major Bitcoin subs are circle jerks for their respective camps. Nothing we can really do about it. Hope we get past it soon, it's bad for business.

Unless you NEED the money at the moment, I'd just hold. At least wait until the next block reward halving in July. If demand stays the same, and the supply is cut in half, that's usually a recipe for a price increase. Your .7 btc will probably be closer to the $400 you need to break even.

This is the correct answer. We've had to endure years of name calling, stalling, conspiracies, trolling and general stagnation in the block size debate. It's been embarrassingly immature and unprofessional in every way. I won't pretend to be smart enough to fully understand the economic or technical ramifications of having three Bitcoin chains, but at least SOMETHING is happening to get the debate solved. It'll be up to the market, not the "evil" Roger Ver, not the "evil" Greg Maxwell, and certainly not some Reddit comment warriors. I'm HODLing both coins until things shake out further.

I would encourage anyone that wants to know this answer to make a post here about Bitcoin Cash (an altcoin, delete, delete), or anything remotely critical of Core, Blockstream or Segwit. Be your own judge. You can hate on Coinbase all you want, but they've been actively trying to get this situation rectified. Should tell you something.

No, I'm telling OP to do his own experiment on the matter, rather than asking one of the two Bitcoin echo-chambers. It's the only scientific way to find out. Try opening a new Reddit account and post pro big-block arguments here for two weeks, and I think they'll find their answer.

Moderation is when ad hominem attacks, blatant trolling, and low-value posts are deleted. Censorship is when opposing viewpoints are stifled instead of discussed. See other Bitcoin implementations like XT, block size debate, etc. A simple google search on the topic should be enough proof for anyone on the fence. Basically anything that doesn't fit into the Core viewpoint of the ecosystem is "moderated".

I'm referring to your lame trolling of people replying to your post. Tacky and undermines your message.

Thanks for the low-quality contributions, honey.

He gives it a 2.5% chance to replace high-fee processors like Visa and Mastercard (market cap $350M), which would give it a value of $17k/BTC. I'm not a fan of that analogy, since it would require all BTC to be in circulation. Nor will it ever REPLACE that market, just eat into it (and other markets that he's not mentioning, like remittance). His alternative to that 2.5% chance is a 97.25% chance of failing and being worth nothing (.25% chance of To The Moon value reserve like gold). Maybe I don't understand risk and value investing, but I didn't think it's a Zero Sum game. Take over Visa, or fail. It'll just eat into all of those markets slowly, increasing in value along the way. But hey, when the old school value investors see the upside, it's a win in my book.

Very mature. If you don't play by my rules, I'll just pack up my toys. I think that's a very empty threat.

So a humongous venture capital company funds a company that has a business model that relies on 2nd tier transactions. Said company doesn't want bigger blocks because that means fewer off-chain transactions. How is THAT not corporate coin?

I don't trust Core OR the miners, they both have lost sight of the big picture and really just care about maintaining their stranglehold. This is completely understandable from a Sociological standpoint. Those in power will do anything to stay in power. I'm certainly sick of the word Segwit, and think it's an overcomplicated solution. As a casual Hodler, and longtime follower of this Civil War, it seems obvious that the Core team has run its course. From their piss-poor PR, their questionable bankster financing, to the rampant censorship, they're making it hard for me to support them, despite knowing that the miners just care about lining their pockets. Time for a change.

I won't take away from his intelligence, but I don't think he's known for being particularly mature. If they do Segwit 2X, I'd be surprised if he doesn't grovel his way back. He a worker, not a leader.
