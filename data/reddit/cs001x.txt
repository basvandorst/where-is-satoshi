My wife was getting sick of it, so one day when she mentioned it to me after having not said anything about it for a while I said “what’s Bitcoin”. She said “good, that’s what I want to hear”. I told her that’s what she’d hear if she divorced me too. Now she asks about it every two weeks and doesn’t complain anymore when I get excited about it.

Robinhood announced two years ago they’d enable withdrawals in the near future. They still haven’t, probably because they can’t, nor will they ever.
Not only are you not participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem, having none of the benefits of actually owning crypto, but you’ve also exposed yourself to significant risk. You have little respect from anyone in this community and shouldn’t have posted this. 
Here’s what’s going to happen:
Robinhood will announce they have no coin, and all of your funds will be lost. How will this happen? Lots of ways it can, but most likely it’ll be related to them operating on a fractional reserve and have no coin at all. If the price goes up too much they’ll exit scam you, and then everyone here can laugh at having lost your fortune. Easy come easy go right?

I buy both and hodl both for years now. Both increase in value compared to the fiat $, and Bitcoin certainly outperforms by orders of magnitude, but it’s far riskier. There’s nothing wrong with diversifying.
Maybe it’s because I’m gen X, neither boomer nor millennial. I can embrace technology yet understand it’s risks.
And dealers that accept BTC are awesome, because most of the time they don’t record transactions. This will be critical in the bear market of 2022.

I was in Tokyo last week and was incredibly disappointed with my experience. I was so excited to spend it at retail and show the wife. I used bitstream green wallet and chose the lowest fee. About 10 seconds after I sent the payment to the QR code on their register phone, I watched in horror as their phone screen said it failed the payment. Total bullshit, Bitcoin didn’t fail and I knew the payment went through just fine, and to my surprise it actually confirmed next block with 2 sats/vbyte in like 10 freaking minutes. 
I stood there for 40min while they called Bitflyer and took my email so they could work through a refund. It took 6 days and 11 emails to get my $35 worth of Bitcoin refund. I considered posting a thread about it, but didn’t want to bitch.
In hindsight I think it “failed” due to a low fee and a perceived slow transaction time, despite it confirming really quick, they probably just rejected it. 
Bic Camera is making a mistake going through a custodial service. They don’t accept Bitcoin directly and after my experience, I wouldn’t recommend supporting them. When they use btcpayserver or something similar, and accept it directly, I’ll have some respect.
tldr; fuck Bitflyer.

Took out a 401k loan in 2018, didn’t catch the bottom and had to float the payments for almost a year. Wife thought I was crazy. On the run down from the recent $13.9k I also didn’t catch the top but I sold enough to be roughly 250% up over the loan, I paid off the loan plus taxes. Basically got free Bitcoin out of the deal. The interest I paid on the loan went to my 401k anyways, and the remaining investments in my 401k ended up losing 6% during that period, so overall it was a super solid win, especially now looking back 18 months ago.
At times I felt sick at my decision, stupid even because I was paying into a losing position, but I’m a patient person and know how to hodl and not lose it day trading. If the price gets low enough I’ll do it again and if it gets even lower than what I think is already a good price I’ll sell all my gold, stocks, and paid off vehicle(financing a new one), and use that plus my cash reserves to float it just long enough for another win.
Do I do all of that liquidation of assets now? No, Bitcoin is at a decent value right now but it’s not rock bottom discount deal sell all my assets and go into debt kinda prices. But, time is running out. We’re 6mo out from the halvening, and 18mo out from a potential ATH. So, time is now on your side. 
If you can float the payments for 18mo and not live on the street, not reduce your family’s quality of life, and are capable of hodling, I say do it. It’s high risk with a high reward and you’d still be considered an early adopter.

I think encouraging users to learn what it means to be their own bank, and the importance of the mnemonic, is an important part of getting into Bitcoin. Just letting people bypass the things they should learn is just going to result in lost Bitcoin and bad long term user experience.
When I got my friends into Bitcoin I took the time to really teach them what it means to be responsible about being your own bank, how to secure it, how to maintain recovery, and how easy it is to use once you’ve put your base knowledge in place. 
Think about how much time it takes to go to a regular fiat bank and get an account created, the effort involved, barriers for entry. Properly learning and setting up yourself as a bank with Bitcoin is far easier and quicker.
Stop enabling people to be lazy and encourage them to actually learn to be responsible.
Oh, and Bitstream Green Wallet is great, but Mycelium is necessary when using a hardware wallet. I’d encourage using both.

Wrong again, man, you just keep putting words in people’s mouths with the wrong assumptions. Another failed attempt at trolling. Keep showing your ignorance.
Let’s say you empty your lightning wallet, just buy more bitcoin on an exchange to replace what you spent and have the exchange send to your favorite lightning refill service. It both improves privacy and significantly reduces fees to negligible amounts. I’ve done this, it works, and you’re only moving the coin you just purchased with fiat.
As for exchanges and not your keys. Everyone will advocate spend and replace, and the majority of your funds held in a hardware wallet. The assumption of holding funds on an exchange was totally from left field, but ya good try.

If you send it directly from an exchange to a lightning service to refill your lightning wallet, the exchange pays the fees and it cost nothing. To initially open the channel you can do so with as little as 1sat/vbyte just like a normal transaction. So, extremely little.
@_date: 2019-08-21 20:02:49
You small little man who knows nothing of Bitcoin. If they’re selling beer for only 1 satoshi then it’s over lightning and has fees so small it’s negligible to even consider.
And even if it isn’t 1 satoshi and it’s on main chain, it would still cost only 1 satoshi/vbyte to get a transaction through for over a year now, we’re talking single digit penny’s if that. Ya, next block would cost more, but for a beer you don’t need to rush it through.

Get a trezor and an android phone, you can use mycelium wallet to send and receive from your trezor without ever having to connect your trezor to a PC.

You have no idea how close we are to mainstream adoption.
by Reddit - Bitcoin / 2019-04-16 02:54
The internet was considered mainstream by the year 2000. In the year 2000 the internet had four hundred million users worldwide.
Today bitcoin has sixty million users adding one million new users per month, and this is accellerating following an exponential adoption curve (Stats courtesy of Wences Casares of Xapo).
It took bitcoin ten years to reach sixty million users. It will take a maximium of five more years to go from sixty million users to four hundred million users, as is the nature of exponential curves, and this is inline with the adoption rate of the internet.
Bitcoin will be considered mainstream at four hundred million users worldwide, and that will take place by the year 2024, possibly earlier if bitcoin is adopted faster than the internet was, given that bitcoin adoption does not require any physical hardware like a dial-up-modem etc.
Its hard to imagine today but mainstream adoption is sneaking up on us silently and quicker than we can comprehend.

Bitcoin exchanges should stop giving a fuck. Like I did in 2005.
by Reddit - Bitcoin / 2019-04-19 23:39
In 2005-06, I was a freshman in college. You know what I did for money? I was a valet attendant at a golf club. I parked cars. Nice cars. I made like $120-150/day easy. It was a good job. A buddy of mine, who was also a valet, got a nice car too. A Lexus, with leather seats and chrome rims. It was tacky as hell by today's standards, but we were idiots.
We weren't satisfied with $150/day. You know what we did? We printed business cards. A chauffeur service. It was totally illegal, and totally against golf club rules, but we didn't give a fuck, because we were stupid. We charged flat rates. You want to go to the airport? $35. You want a ride to the stadium? $40. The nightclub at the beach? $50. We gave cards to all the guests. When my buddy was working his shift, I'd drive. When I was working, he'd drive (my car sucked, so his Lexus was all we had). Soon we were making $300-350/day. It was Uber before smartphones.
Then one day the supervisor at the golf club was walking by the ashtray garbage bins near the entrance and he found one of the business cards on the floor. It had our names and phone numbers on it. He was pissed. He called us both into the office and told us what we were doing was illegal, and against the club rules. He fired us.
The irony of the situation is that Uber did the same exact shit we were doing. They were illegal, too. They had no license to operate a taxi service, and their service was against all municipal rules and ordinances. They just fucking shoved their way in and did it, and asked questions later. They had more balls, technology, and money than we did.
So how does Bitcoin fit into this story? Right now Bitcoin is hard to buy. The reason is because the operators of these kiosks and bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase are giant pussies. That's the truth. I went to Coinstar's website to find a kiosk near my area and there were none. Imagine that. They're only placed in the worst mini-marts, in the worst neighborhoods in town. If they put a Coinstar BCH/BTC buying kiosk in a major thoroughfare in my area they would rake in the cash. All they have to do is convince a major mall owner or a supermarket company to say yes. That should be easy, because money talks. I went a few days ago to deposit money in Coinbase to buy BCH and they're holding it for 10 days. Fucking cowards. They're scared of fraud, but what they don't realize is that they're scaring away all their customers. At some point they need to put a giant neon sign that says "COINBASE. BUY BITCOIN WITH CASH, RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW," in giant blue neon letters, in front of the biggest mall in town.
That's what needs to happen.
Am I right?

DCA weekly and buy large amounts when it hits you’re value targets. 
Lets say you can afford a DCA of $200 a week, and have $50k cash saved for Bitcoin. When it hits $7k drop $12k. If it goes back up to $9k, DCA back down to $6k, drop another $12k, rinse and repeat at $5k and $4k. The market goes in cycles and waiting patiently for your value targets will increase the amount of coin you collect without having the stress of day trading it. And in the event the market never drops to those targets, you still have your affordable DCA weekly buys. Most plebs can’t time the bottom and cant time the top, so don’t try and just go for what seems like a decent deal to you.

$30k or 1/3 in btc, $30k or 1/3 in gold 1oz coins now. Save the rest and DCA into stocks once the global recession starts in 14mo and buy stocks cheap. Wait and watch what Berkshire and Buffet are doing during the recession and try to follow. I would suggest DCA into BTC and gold, but man the halvening is less than a year away. Plus we’re at the end of a 75 day correction in a bull market with stable prices and it’s anyone’s guess if it breaks out above or below, frankly you’re simply running out of time for DCA to give maximum return on both gold and btc due to both recession warnings and halvening timings.
But, please do treat yourself and scratch that itch, live like you make 3x your salary for a few weeks while you prepare yourself for pretending like you never even got this money, then invest all but emergency funds.
6 years sounds like a lot of time, but in 2025 you’ll be wealthy for making these choices.

Incredibly frustrating indeed.
The last time I went into a branch I needed about $30,000 in cash, it took me four hours and I ended up having to go to three different branches because each branch would only get about $10,000 at a time. Yes, I know I’m supposed to call ahead, but after two days of trying to call the branch over three different phone calls they never answered so I never had a chance to prepare them for my cash pick up.
I could have moved the equivalent amount in bitcoin within 10 minutes, not having to leave my home, and even if I paid a higher fee it’s still would’ve cost significantly less than the fuel it cost me to get around.
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:14:29
Totally agreed, and we’re like what 14mo out from a recession? This is a really bad time to buy a house, much less any asset inflated by the current financial system.
I’ve got my eye on two properties near the lake that I want for airBNB rentals, I’ve got the cash and effort to procure them, but damned if I’m buying anything right now.
When buffet starts investing his $50 billion in cash that’s just sitting there, saying the stock market is overpriced, I’ll start considering investing in other assets again. Watch what the big boys are doing. It’s not spending their cash, that’s what.
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:08:48
I personally would not. Here’s why:
Right now is the middle of the halvening cycle and it’s the second greatest time to be accumulating, the first being after capitulation during crypto winter at the end of 2018.
Selling now is like selling in 2015 before the 2017 bull run. We’re in a time of maximum potential. You should be buying, not selling.
Ya maybe once this correction finishes it keeps going back up, maybe it drops back down to below $3k. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that this is the middle of the cycle and well... kudos to you if you time the market well, but unlikely you will.
But most importantly... a down payment? No, just no man. If it was for the whole cost of the house then I’d say sure, ok maybe. But to sell your bitcoin to go into debt on a mortgage loan for huge chunk of your life? That’s a strong NO from me dog. Why? Because you don’t trade bitcoin for fiat debt, it’s counterintuitive to the entire idea of financial freedom and what bitcoin stands for.

This should have been posted to github as an open source project for all. Hosting it and asking users to give out their API keys is immoral. You’re intention might ultimately be good, but you’re presentation of the solution is incredibly flawed.
For anyone thinking of using this, don’t.

Just because you limit withdrawals doesn’t means you won’t lose your entire balance.

This important statement doesn’t just apply to exchanges and custodial services, it applies to girlfriends as well. In the event you break up and she has the keys, you’re fucked if she understands it enough to claim it into her own wallet.
If you truly want to share this experience with her, I recommend you consider a multi signature wallet for storing it, that way you both get equal vote has to how to use it. Or, maybe you each get your own hardware wallet and split it equally.
