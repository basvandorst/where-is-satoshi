Good argument?

I care about "decentralized" and so do many of the people I know. As for the new people I meet, when I sense they might understand "decentralized" I might talk about Bitcoin with them. And who said anything about evangelizing?

You can blame the gob for that.

I can see that. I guess the thing for me, I see Bitcoin as money and a tool that is more than just money. Brand new people that know little to nothing about BTC might see it like WoW gold or something "not real." I guess all I'm trying to put out there is that new people, new folks who kind of understand what bitcoin is, and those who are coming here to Reddit to learn more, I guess I just want them to think about the question, "How much are you worth" before they ask it. Some people will feel uncomfortable about it. That's all I'm saying :)
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:25:52
I'll admit I own Bitcoin, and I think that's enough. But I don't like telling people my exact number.

If people started paying for porn with Bitcoin, how would the sites know they were getting money from someone at least 18. It was my understanding that a credit card helped prove the age somehow. But what do I know...I'm no expert. Could this be an opportunity for the government to start banning the use of Bitcoin (in this industry) to save the children?

Hey TigerDirect - **How about a discount if we use Bitcoin?**
I'm thinking about buying an expensive computer in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:31:08
To add on to this idea - you get a student loan or money from your parents and the Bitcoins can only be spent at very specific locations. This would prevent students from blowing their loan money on beer, babes and blow.

You need to get out more. I talk to more people than I do on reddit. I wasn't even thinking about reddit folks or "the community." I was specifically thinking about MY friends, MY family, and MY co-workers from MY personal experience and MY personal observations. I'm not making general claims that must 100% apply to everyone in every situation. ALL I'm saying is that everyone I've talked to in my life (face-to-face) wanted to know my Bitocin worth.

**I just sent an email to Dr Smith to confirm this. I will give an update if he responds.** 
He responded to my email very quickly! Here is what he said:
Sure.  I have simply not been offered Bitcoin as payment as yet.  With our online pricing which you can see at  I have no room for discounts.  I would probably ask for a Bitcoin payment the equivalent of the dollar price I have listed online.
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:13:25
Nope, sure didn't.

Great job! Are blogs free to use this?
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:38:23
I guess I don't see it that way. When I talk about Bitcoin to face-to-face people I'm not strumming the "it'll make you rich" cord over and over again. I mostly talk about how it's decentralized and hard/next to impossible for the government to control. I also like how it frees me and others to be their own bank without a lot of 3rd party controls. When I talk about those things, I don't think people are thinking, "That's a scam." Do you?

I agree. The Bitcoin logo seems arbitrary in the middle of the works. The logo seems like an afterthought. The logo is obviously the focal point, but how do the other elements/parts of the composition work with the logo? I don't really see that it does.

If time is subjective then you can rewrite the script. 40 means nothing as does 20. Whatever you wanted to do at 20 (but never got around to it) is still possible at 40. The key is to actively progress on a worthy goal. That's it. If you are doing that, you are succeeding. Using arbitrary ages as mile posts or levels where ideal success should be is futile. This is an illogical way to judge. Go deeper and ask yourself, "Am I currently making active progress toward a worthy goal?" However you answer is where your focus should be centered.

I'm offering a pretty big [discount]( for those who choose to buy my e-book with bitcoin.  The normal discounted price via PayPal ranges around 20-30 bucks, but if one uses bitcoin, I'll sell it to them for $10 worth of bitcoin.

"Bitcoin is Internet cash that's open-source, peer-to-peer, potentially anonymous, bank-free, government-free and it's a money transfer system with little to no fees for merchants and customers, plus it's a great investment opportunity because it's a scarce resource."

Are you going to use Coinbase? BTW, just do an image search for "we accept Bitcoin" and you should find what you need.
@_date: 2013-07-26 21:42:52
I agree! People getting started with Bitcoin need to know their fiat isn't "getting lost" if they buy Bitcoin. Knowing they can easily turn that magic money into funny money is crucial for future success. And like you said, once they see how green the grass is on the Bitcoin side of the fence, they will stick around.
@_date: 2013-03-09 19:53:56
...and since they are scarce, their value will increase.
/does that make sense?
@_date: 2013-03-09 19:10:22
**That's a good point in knowing your audience.  How's this:**
*Libertarian:*  Bitcoin is new money that's open-source, decentralized, and potentially anonymous and can't be controlled by the government.
*Money-Minded:*  Bitcoin is new Internet-created money which fosters lower fees for international money transfers, merchants, and it's an investment opportunity.
*Technically-Minded:*  Bitcoin in new money created online that's open-source and cryptographically impossible to hack and it's potential is yet untapped.

Competition!  I love it; that's the bitcoin marketplace at work.  All I want is a simple text-based widget that just looks like I wrote it out on my site.  So for example, "Buy the e-book for $10 worth of bitcoin which equals 0.293 BTC."  So all I need is the text, "0.293" to automatically update itself.  I'd like to easily be able to change the code to adjust the size, font, color, and to make it bold or italicized whenever I want.  And I'd be happy to pay 0.1 BTC for this, and I'd love to share the code here at Reddit for free.
@_date: 2013-12-30 12:42:00
Keep things simple. If the customer bought something for 1 BTC and wants his money back in a month or 90 days or whatever the terms are, then he should only get 1 BTC back. It's too messed-up to think about comparing BTC to fiat when it comes to "returns." If I return something to Walmart now after 90 days, do I need them to figure out if the "dollar" has gone up or down in value and pay me back accordingly?

That's crazy!  I was just thinking about "bitcoin" and "business cards."  I was thinking about how cool it would be if I had a business card that was filled with bitcoin info.
I think it would be cool to have some cards in my pocket to give away.  I was wanting the card to give a quick bitcoin definition, where to get more info online, where to buy and sell bitcoin, and why bitcoin will be the future of money.  
If you could design this and open up the design for us, I would tip you in bitcoin :)
