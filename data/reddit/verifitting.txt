From alpha to final by end of Q1 2018? Not gonna happen, sorry. I'd actually be surprised if they have a working beta by then.

Last I read exchanges and services actually wanting to implement Segwit said they were being hindered by core itself. See for yourself:
If that doesn't at least hurt your confidence in the core developers a little bit I'm not sure what will...
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:15:48


I too regret this. It's a little juvenile and I hope one day we'll pass this 'phase' and all get over ourselves.

@_date: 2017-12-08 13:39:10
Saying "hopefully LN will be implemented soon" when it's needed RIGHT NOW is pretty painful :/ so many people creating threads like this, stuck waiting 24+hours
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:26:18
Some comments were deleted but the gist was "many services simply haven't implemented because segwit addresses aren't available on the reference bitcoin client yet".
There's also this  ... I mean, it's hard to not see Segwit as a huge failure, at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:00:46


 BCH's blocks are starting to get filled. Does that not look like 'actual scaling' to you?
I recommend reading through this thread and see if you're really so sure the other sub is so insane, or just maybe they are right about *some* things at least 
Or not. I just think is starting to behave like a cult. "I heard that Roger Ver runs his own sock puppet and account trading website" do you flat out believe everything that is said here? :| sock puppet and account trading website? lol

Certain outsiders view each "side" as a near- cult though [link]( :p I just find it ridiculous to say "BCH is seeming more and more like a cult" while not wanting to see the same ridiculous-ness in the Bitcoin sub as well.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:50:39


You're so optimistic and hopeful lol, I fear LN is ways off. Read paragraph "*No rush*" 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:31:48


That's the thing, they're not. They're independent, which seems like a good thing.


I don't know, I think many people would be relieved if at least some measure was implemented. Read this:  Many addresses can no longer move their bitcoin, only the "richer" can. I don't think that's much in credit to Bitcoin "advancing". Some day things may be fixed, yes. But people can be impatient especially since Segwit is not being adopted and LN is an atrociously huge project in terms of software development, no one is sure when it will be "ready".
I see that archive.is post, note the reply asking "Do you have any more details? Names? Scope?". No source, just an unnamed person claiming to have witnessed something. Maybe just me but that does not convince me. I am reading a LOT on both and BTC, and the first is much more quick to censor posts than the latter. There's constantly people bashing on /r/ BTC about Roger and about "Bcash", these posts don't get deleted at all. Downvoted maybe, but never deleted.
About the Roger Ver/ Mt Gox video, yes bad call of him. Still, that was long ago. I'm right now telling my friends I use Kraken as an exchange, it's slow but it works and accepts Euro. If tomorrow kraken is hacked, could I really have known? I'm not a proponent of Roger at all though, I don't think he has a lot of charisma and I don't think he has a lot of tech knowledge. Then again, he isn't "behind" Bitcoin cash, just a supporter. The people that originally forked off into BCH had nothing to do with him as far as I know, he just jumped on the bandwagon and has been positively, and negatively associated with BCH since.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:32:56
It's not user wallets being hacked, it's a website that has been compromised either by security flaw or inside job.
Users can only withdraw every 0.01btc earned, not earlier, so a huge amount of people were simply waiting on their pay-out, not relying on the site as storage at all... (for all you know they were withdrawing to a custom linux distro or hardware wallet anyway).
Sucks for all users of the website truly.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:26:42
You realize bch would be much hard to fill to the brim that it would be unusable?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:41:14
That's weird, the transaction is obviously confirmed.
Probably coinbase lagging behind because of crazy load, I'm sure it's going to be fine. Try and definitely coinbase support, make more tickets. Should be fine!
Also, having 10+ let alone 25 btc in this subreddit will make people message you probably, beware.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:04:06


I guess that's true. LTC, BCH, BTC are all basically competitors (unless you see BTC only as a store of value now).


While that is true, Litecoin is mined by the same mining farms, using just another piece of ASIC equipment. BTC, BCH, LTC, they're all dependent on ASICs for mining :/ People can buy them but the producers are powerful indeed...


I mean yes. Short-sighted, maybe, but with the current state of affairs... if Bitcoin Cash didn't happen, *someone* would have eventually made a fork, possibly a much more foul one (think Bitcoin Gold where people got their btc stolen due to their main wallet being malware...).
Since the Bitcoin ledger is public, forks are inevitable. If Bitcoin Cash was called BitCash, other forks could have taken the Bitcoin name, and again the crypto community could have suffered from it. What I'm trying to say is that this thing was inevitable to happen, and we'll just have to see what kind of effect all this forking business will have on the larger crypto community.
You're absolutely right though, the way things are they're far from perfect, but well if everything involved in Bitcoin got along that would have been great. It's gotten too big though, so conflicts of interest are not that surprising.
Good discussion though :) restoring my faith in this sub
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:25:04


This is where you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:07:33
Nicehash has importance in the bitcoin ecosystem because they let people mine any coin and get paid in bitcoin. Hence why some alts are way down in difficulty now. Speaks for itself that it's not unimportant?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:41:35


Yeah I mostly meant that half of this sub is hodl memes, and that people here can be really narrow-minded at times is all (in my view).
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:08:02
PS my reply to you is not showing -.- seems to have been hidden:


Like I said, Ethereum has since their CryptoKitties adventure increased the block size as well, right away, and has since looking into further advancement. It might be "easy" but it helped a lot! I don't understand why a lot of people are so disgusted by a block size increase. Either way for the future we'll see who has the "best" approach to scaling.
I do believe Bitcoin Cash developers has a long term vision, absolutely.


See this developers journal for example: ... can't link it here on r bitcoin -.- look up cash-development-plan on google. Why can't I even link it though. First time witnessing the kind of things I hear about the main bitcoin sub for myself.


Yes, eventually. Who knows when, though. They have a lot of great minds thinking about how they're going to approach it, very intrigued about how they're going to make the change the day it happens.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:33:39
It's because your transaction was dropped from the mempool. It's full, so lower priority tx's can get dropped. Sucks but it's the current state of things -.-
But segwit will be adopted! But LN will come! In the meanwhile, bitcoin is broken and all people here can say it's *just temporary* and *hodl* ..
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:15:34
Well we'll see. Software product cycle from alpha to beta to working product on something like a layer two network hub or whatever you want to call LN would take much more than 4 months is just what I think.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:53:27
It's the biggest hub to mine bitcoin with asics or altcoins with any CPU/GPU, and get paid in bitcoin. There's literally nothing bigger that enables mining to get paid in btc for both professionals and the masses.
If it really has been hacked, a lot of mining whales and enthusiasts depending on it just lost a lot of confidence in crypto as a whole. Saying 60 million is "small" makes you seem very out of touch with the world honestly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:48:32
Yes seconded, probably should have made a verified GDAX account or something with high limits.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:25:32


Why do you think people are putting their faith in one guy like you say, though? I'm sure many don't even like Roger V. and have not sold their bitcoin cash to see if it ended up successful, those people have won if you look at what it's currently valued at.
I don't like Roger and can appreciate the temporary relief a bigger block size can bring. BTC is only for the rich now, since people trying to send low amounts have their btc returned with message "Transaction failed". The mempool is FULL, and there's nothing going to change that in the immediate future.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:27:16


I really don't understand this, it's extremely speculative. Why does Bitcoin work any better as a store of value as say Monero? :/
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:42:45


Well most people here say they have and I quote "no solutions", which is just not really true, which is the only point I wanted to make.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:37:32
I don't really want to get into politics, but the BCH fork happened due to people not agreeing with each other. The majority wanted Segwit, so the minority forked and did its own thing. "Lite" coin has a 84Mil. coin supply and a different use case as far as I see, so why would they jump onboard with Litecoin?
 Furthermore the team behind Litecoin is supportive of everything BCH disliked about what Bitcoin changed to the code. The people behind BCH found Segwit to be an atrocity and in short, two groups disagreed and forked off.
I understand that Bitcoin supporters don't like that Bitcoin Cash has upended the Bitcoin name into its coin, but right now Bitcoin Cash can be used very well for peer to peer transactions which was their goal, and recently it is really picking up in value. As far as I see the fork was a success.


Note also that BCH changed their difficulty algorithm and now has a DAA that prevents huge hashing power swings. This is directly hugely protective for BTC's hashing power. Huge fallouts have no longer happened since the change, see  the lines no longer ever touch or get close. I guess they did this so that they can coexist in harmony, and as BCH potentially gains in value hash power might slowly go to their side, but never all at once (as sometimes happened in the past with the old algorithm). 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:41:38
I would still be all in in Bitcoin if it worked as well as it did when I bought into it. It's hard to stay neutral, but both BTC and BCH have a vision to keep scaling, not just BTC. I dislike that in general in this sub BCH is shot down as a ridiculous imposter, while they ARE in fact very much developing their scaling along just like BTC is. And right now, while their bigger blocks are working fairly well (ethereum has increased their block size as well by now, by the way), they're looking into other options for the future which do seem promising such as Graphene and possibly zero-conf transactions if merchants desire it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:01:52
Me too.. on the other had I had a bad feeling about this from the very start.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:12:44

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:53:04
I feel you man.. I feel like Nicehash should use their own funds for these pay-outs fucks sake.
But yeah we're talking $60M so we're probably fucked. Maybe they continue service and compensate us one way or another.

One hundred percent agree with you
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:13:21


It would take much longer before BCH is in the situation BTC is in, though.
Several independent developer teams are working at further scaling solutions, just in a different direction than Segwit/Lightning Network is heading in.. I don't like the war between BTC and BCH honestly, but at least I can see that BCH is working right now. BTC, not so much. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:49:31

from the instructions:
- open terminal and enter the following commands, followed by pressing enter and giving your OSX user password when prompted:
- npm install -g mbexport
- mbexport ~/Library/Application Support/MultiBitHD/mbhd-FILL IN THIS STRING WITH YOUR ACTUAL WALLET PATH/mbhd.wallet.aes
(TIP: You could also locate the wallet file in the file explorer application (in finder you can use Go to from the 'Go' menu, enter "~/Library/Application Support/MultiBitHD/" for the destination). Type mbexport in the terminal prompt you opened, and then drag the file from explorer to the command prompt to complete the prompt: it should fill in the long file name for you)
- It will ask your passphrase that you used to unlock your MultiBit HD password in the past:
MultibitHD wallet opened -&gt; Enter your passphrase: 
- After that, look up to import your seed into electrum wallet, this is really straightforward (an example seed would be: measure swim globe radio reunion awful reflect tail produce treat cluster spot, which you should be able to use to import into a wallet such as electrum)

If you have no unconfirmed transactions you can just use your password to unlock, and send it to a fresh new wallet such as an Electrum Wallet, no?
If you have funds that are 'stuck', don't bother use the 'repair' function. Either use the above instructions to unlock your passphrase/seed.
Or do what I did. If you have your RECOVERY from Multibit HD (recovery words + time stamp), install OLD version v0.3.0 on another computer (or TEMPORARILY rename your '~/Library/Application Support/MultiBitHD/mbhd' wallet so it TEMPORARILY doesn't automatically load that one), and use your recovery (the thing it specifically mentions to keep somewhere when making a wallet) into old v0.3.0: it cleared all my unconfirmed transactions in Mutlibit HD in an easy way.

Some did, most didn't. The server it communicated with was quickly shut down due to a killswitch in the malware itself which someone found, so subsequent 'fulfilled' random money could not be used to unlock the software, lol.. at the same time it also stopped further spreading of the first run of the malware, IIRC.
Also, a lot of edits of the original floated around with the bitcoin address changed to wallet of whoever edited it, which made it impossible to unlock these 'hijacked' WannaCry variants floating around.
All in all I doubt a lot of people who actually paid got results :/

The door wasn't properly locked in the end I *suppose*.

But well. Past days it's still been rising though. Doesn't look like a lot of hodlers are dumping right now, quite the opposite.

Too soon, man.

At the new fork, you will get BCC as much as you have BTC because it's based on the same ledger. After the fork, it's no longer based on each other, got it?
So if you send BTC to a new wallet, they are fully separate from that moment onwards.

Sorry dude. 
EDIT: new tweet says BTC-E will return in 5-10 days.

Except if it's seized to be hodled indefinitely.

This is what I find strange about it all, too. Then again, besides 'logical' it could really have been planned, though.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:26:56
Not sure anything really happened tho
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:55:30
Most of us enjoy reading about the drama though. Well, not the whales maybe.

Mind : Blown

I personally use Electrum. It's simple and transparent. Like other software wallets, it's the responsibility of the user to keep the keys safe, not get malware on their PC, have a (paper) copy of their wallet info somewhere in case of hardware failure, et cetera.
But as far as the program goes, I think it's perfect at what it does. Then again, Breadwallet might not be any worse, I just got Electrum because it's also recommend a lot around here.
