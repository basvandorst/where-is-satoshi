Okay. I also notice another inconsistency, but in the consumer's favor. Hopefully they get things straightened out, because I was particularly interested in the tablet.

Hm, my problem was unrelated to this. I suggest calling NewEgg customer service if you're still having problems.

Thanks for the response.
That's unfortunate that Target made that move. Why is Target concerned how technology is used? It seems that Target is being anti-consumer. 
Any word on a "Gyft-lite" app requiring less permissions, similar to what you described in [this comment]( 3 months ago? In that comment you also stated that Gyft is fully functional from a mobile browser, which it no longer is.
Permissions concern me, but they aren't my primary concern. I'd rather not use any smartphone at all.

Very recently I was entering the opening words to various bitcoin related questions into Google to see the suggested searches. "Can bitcoin...?" brought up  "Can bitcoin be hacked?" as the first suggestion. It's obviously something people are concerned about. I think he  dropped the ball by only addressing concerns by pointing out that it's still the early days of bitcoin. Regardless, he made a good point.

Certain government currencies have had serious issues sometimes to the point of failure. Look at Brazil, Argentina and Zimbabwe for example. A quick google search brought an [article on failed currencies]( in case you're interested in learning more.
I'm not very knowledgeable about economics. I'm mainly interested in bitcoin because of its utility. Using an android wallet has been a convenient and seamless experience so far. The future of what can be done with the blockchain, to me, seems to have a large potential. 
I hold a small to moderate amount of bitcoin because I believe in the technology. I don't feel the need to go around acting like a cheerleader or trying to sell something like certain bitcoin enthusiasts do.
Part of the reason I'm posting this is because I've seen the same post "you are all fucking delusional" here at least four times in the past 24 hours. Always "fucking delusional" too. Please, there's no need to lump us all together.
Though I'm not personally offended by your words, the timely quote from seems appropriate "Remember the human."

Or sign something with the private key.

Oh, duh. I'll blame not having had coffee yet today.

Do they display the Walmart gift card barcode on the web? I noticed that they recently stopped displaying at least their Target barcodes. A physical barcode is my preferred manner to use Gyft.

Newegg's LG tablet deal is only showing up as $60 off, which comes to $193 instead of the listed $150. :-/
*edit: The price is now, as of 18:30 ET, correct. The coupon code is still $60 off, but tablet's base price changed. It could be a flash sale, so the price might not last.

Just crested ten..

Gyft isn't involved. 
Edit: deleted a misunderstanding

While this is true, it's kind of moot. At the time of ordering could have easily converted any USD to bitcoin or vice versa.
