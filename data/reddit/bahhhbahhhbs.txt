Pretty sure the first product offered on the site was mushrooms he grew himself, and he sold them.  So, he sold drugs.

I'm not saying his sentence is warranted.  I'm just saying he did sell drugs, which he did.  Facts are facts, and just because the sentence is harsh, it doesn't change the fact that the first thing for sale on Silk Road, which was posted by him, was drugs.  You can still make your case without watering down the truth.

He definitely bit off more than he could chew.  He was definitely naive.  He was definitely smart as fuck.  ...and there is no way he should be serving a life sentence.  The corruption of the law enforcement who was investigating him and pilfering BTC is more appaling than what a 20 something yr old kid who was in over his head and spinning plates at the end did.  Should he get a second chance, for fuck's sake, yes.  Carl Marks Force and Shawn Bridges should be serving more time than him because they were supposed to be upholding the law.  Instead, they entrapped Ulbricht and stole almost $1mil BTC.  Ulbricht had no criminal record and was way too young to be serving serious, serious time for this.  There is no doubt that given an opportunity, Ulbricht could be an asset to society, certainly more so than Force and Bridges at this point considering they were supposed to be defenders of society as sworn federal agents and ended up being thieves and thugs themselves.
