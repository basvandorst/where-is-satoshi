However, people are only exposed to currency devaluation/fluctuation if they at some point convert the currency. What you are describing is inflation, which while minimised, doesn't go away with bitcoin.
It goes back to my previous point I made above - people will only accept bitcoin if virtually everything they purchase is in bitcoin too. Unless that is the case, they are exposing themselves to 'unnecessary' systematic and exchange rate risk. There is therefore not only no driver for people to change their deeply embedded behavior, but a very large deterrent too.
I enjoy the discussion however. :)

Wow, if you could just use inflation to pay for things, Zimbabwe must have HEAPS of .... things. 
It is a ridiculous statement. Inflation is by no means an economic freebie.

Yeah, currently. But not many people would accept the inherent volatility in bitcoin. People want stability in the currency in which they are paid (or no volatility at all if no conversion has to happen). So until everything they purchase is in bitcoin too, very few will want to be exposed to a paycheck that could half in value that month/week etc.

Not sure about that - look at commodity markets globally. More participants lead to far greater volatility - why would that be different for bitcoin?

I disagree - certainly for the short to medium term anyway. Very, very few people can sit on their paycheck for 22 months. Also, why are people not doing it now then: people could receive their paycheck in any currency theoretically and benefit from exchange rate fluctuations. But 99.9% of the time people request it in their local currency - I do not see any driver to change this behavior.
