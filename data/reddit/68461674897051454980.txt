2006 housing market, is that you? 
the amount that people pay in rent/mortgage for houses/apts they shouldn't even be living in, just because "they could afford the payments" (barely) is unbelievable. 
i guess that's the culture these days, tread water with a 50lb pack on and hope nothing goes wrong

youre ignoring the fact that holding a significant portion of your total worth in something like bitcoin, or even gold, opens you up to massive fluctuations. If you had thought "let me put 30% of my total worth in btc" when it was at $800, or gold when it was $1800/oz, you would have taken a huge loss
when you add that to the fact that so many people have so little savings due to their lifestyle choices, that could wipe a person out.
the reason people like fiat currency is 2 years from now, a ____ is (most likely) going to buy you about what you could buy 2 years ago. Whereas with something like gold or btc, it could be massively more or less
@_date: 2015-06-20 10:13:56
this is true but most people prefer gold for storing assets just because of the history and globally accepted value
hopefully btc stabilizes in price and continues to grow in popularity, if it's not btc it'll be something else as cryptocurrency is def. the next step 
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:21:44
wow thanks for the information
the chinese miners don't like it because it would take up more bandwidth on their networks I guess? and that somehow slows down their mining? 
@_date: 2015-06-23 07:34:23
yeah based on how you've explained it, an increasing schedule makes a lot more sense 
thanks again for explaining it :)

people are being hurt, but when you understand the basic economics behind it all, you see how these programs that people have become reliant and dependent on, as economics predicted, is a literal growing problem 
similar to greece
@_date: 2015-06-27 21:46:58
thats why people with any money don't keep it in banks, but treasury bills/bonds. it's backed by the us govt, and if that defaults... well you're fucked either way
but that's where things like btc or gold become interesting 
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:16:35
those still have a lot more risk than tbills, when people are parking multiple millions of dollars they don't want that much risk, or if they do they have better alternatives

eli-18 or a link to what blocksize is?
is it something to do with how many transactions per second you can do on btc? or is it the amount of bitcoin transactions in one block?
and how do chinese miners benefit from a smaller block size?
any info is appreciated, as i have been recommending btc to people but is this a security risk or anything?

I'm a 1 man operation as well, but what difference does that make?
How often when you talk to someone on the phone do you ask who they work with?
anyways I make up people to sound like a bigger company and to have people to blame things on. You should meet my secretary Christine, she sucks at letting me know I had missed calls =)

5 million people could have something that is $1 or $500

be part of the change
offer a % discount for paying in BTC. The more people that start using it, the better they'll see it is and the more it'll spread. 
I've taught some small shops at a local selling event to accept BTC instead of those shitty cell phone card readers that take a big chunk. for a subscription service i run i give a 10% discount for btc
@_date: 2015-08-05 11:48:22
I looked it up. It's for $0 fee*
*exchange rate rape
So basically the same as fees but they tell you it's 'free' so people use it while they get the same money out of you with a really shitty exchange rate. sneaky sneaky

There's not really much you can do. 
The kids don't want to do the work, the parents don't give a shit and want the schools to raise the kids, so it is what it is. 
If your parents care about your grades so you're forced to learn, and you just do what the teacher tells you, you learn plenty. I graduated HS with 6 credits in calculus and I wasn't a particularly dedicated student and didn't do much homework
*edit - ah yes, downvotes. never the parents fault, it must be because we're not SPENDING enough. American mentality, i guess. and decades earlier I guess schools were just flowing with money*

there are real costs of physical cash, but there are also companies, in this case western union - a $10.3 billion company, making money off the exchange. I remember even trying to using WU in the US once and didn't because the crazy fees.

it's the most advanced medical care in the world, so not sure how it's a joke?
the problem is the public morons say "free healthcare", which is just contributing to the problem by attacking the symptoms and not the root of the problem. Even obamacare now has massively added to the problem. 
if there was "free" healthcare, i'm scared to even imagine how much it would cost when the government is taking care of costs instead... maybe a hospital gown would go from $100 to $600.

not downboating you, but you realize these companies WANT the regulations in place? 
They have enough money to pass the barriers to entry (buying a car, meeting all the 'requirements', paying license fees), while a person with a car who wants to be a taxi can pretty much never do it? 
@_date: 2015-07-10 17:00:38
well to have proper communication, especially now in a global arena, we need to have standards so we can understand each other. obviously in that post i was joking, but in general its true because tiny deviations in each area turn into larger ones over times
imagine if with sciences we just started changing little things in lab reports, eventually research would be almost unusable from another area of the world. thats why the standards are so strictly enforced 
also people posting like "DO. THIS. NOW" are annoying, especially when the person can't even put a period between each word like the comment i replied to

I think they're on the right path now that apple has brought more competition to them. They had to fight the "windows has viruses" perception with windows defender (Free), and they are also making win10 free to make people who think win8 was shitty (even though with a few settings changes it is fine) feel better about having a windows computer
as for their products, with hololens, the surface tablets, etc i think they are on a much better path vs the crap they sold before (zune for example)
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:18:20
you are being ripped off for the fact that the government will not do something as cheaply as a private company would be able to do it. 
You do pay less tax, which covers many things, but the part you pay for healthcare is more than it would be if you were paying for health insurance/Dr visits in a private system. 
*edit - ah yes, downvotes because facts that aren't debatable. ok...*
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:25:52
it's worse now with obamacare, because all it does is attack the symptom of the problem "high costs" by throwing more money at it, which has increased prices even more for those who pay directly and indirectly...
Reform which targeted the root of the problem is what's needed, and then "free" healthcare like the rest of the "first world countries" is not needed because it's always cheaper for a private company to do something than the government. Of course that would cut in to corporate profits (the people who pay attention), so they'll keep running the system and cashing out while the people who should care (american public) keep eating mcdonalds and watching american idol. YES WE CAN!
has it reduced the number of people with no coverage? yes. but at what cost? (hint: a lot)
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:00:12
that would be cool, i actually haven't even had much time to meet anyone to buy btc, i just have (what was a few months ago) $1 of btc  someone tipped me on here.

@_date: 2015-07-16 15:16:23
firstly, there are extra healthcare costs in the US because 2 out of 3 people are overweight, half of those being obese. 
but even with 'companies trying to make shitloads of profit', in a free market economy, it will still be cheaper than "free" healthcare. This isn't something we can debate, it's an economic fact.
the US has nothing close to a free market system in pretty much anything anymore
