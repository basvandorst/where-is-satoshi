And we all thought you were joking about 20k by dinner...

This is a good way to get physical bitcoin pretty quickly (1-day) while falling into a well known regulatory regime.
Future contracts are regulated by the CFTC and have clear rules. Also, BAKKT is owned by ICE and they have tons of futures trading already so it's something they're skilled in.  And finally, institutions trust ICE and the CFTC.
Another factor is that futures contracts, compared to trading the actual underlying bitcoin, shares, etc, enable more liquidity b/c you don't have to already own something to engage in selling.  And they enable more leverage too b/c you only have to post margin.  I used to be in trading, and if you compare the futures market on stocks and bonds to the market for those actual stocks and bonds, you'll see surprising liquidity and volumes.  More money trades on the CME than the NYSE.

No good reason for it vs a 190 day or 210 day other than 200 is a Schelling Point and many ppl watch the 200 day.

Yeah, you’re correct about volumes for bitcoin futures vs real BTC trading.  I was talking about in mature markets (stocks and bonds).  I bet over time futures volumes will outpace or approach real BTC trading.  Just look at how popular BitMex is.
But good question about Bakkt vs cash settled CME.  I think you bring up a good point that shows Bakkt isn’t as revolutionary as getting CME futures was.  I didn’t quite realize that until thinking about your question.  I still think a regulated and trusted way to get actual BTC exposure is valueable a new though.

Great point. So Bakkt is directly impactful to price if it can help institutions go net long (perhaps via an ETF). 
Whereas futures are important for price discovery (enabling short as well as long) and to help legitimize crypto. But don’t enable a new class of net buyers.

Cool idea but 365 \* 5 / 7 = 261 week days a year

Cool question that made me think of the circumstances around each.  
30% dominance at $19.8k was along with a ton of scammy overvaluations
57% dominance at $6.2k may be a necessary stop along the way as bad ICOs are shaken out while the good coins continue to build.
Perhaps the next time we hit $20k the dominance will be at 50%+ and there will be a bunch of actually useful crypto projects out there?

Google "trading days per year" and you get:

What about figuring out the transaction fee you'll need to add to your bitcoin payment to make sure it'll execute in the time you need it?
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:40:18
Isn't bitcoin mining power greater than the 20+ largest super computers in the world? And changing transactions deeper in history Grows exponentially expensive. IMHO we don't need that much power - we need better usability.

Another punch line: 2025 is just 8 years away

You’re being too reasonable and using logic. That’s not how things are supposed to work in the church of BTC vs the imams of BCH
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:25:59
BCH  offers cheap transactions (at the moment but not necessarily at scale 10x current BTC) with the same blockchakn history as BTC up until mid 2017. 
So if $8 to transact is more than your daily earnings, as is the case in much of the world, BTC is currently of little use.

Thanks for all that detail.  It's very helpful to understand things a little better.  I'm going to look into a cold storage option but keep breadwallet as my main on-the-go wallet.

Well, it certainly is an ulterior motive and alternative incentive, but it's not just for a tiny bit of extra profit.  Wouldn't they have to replace all of their specially designed hardware chips if SegWit passed?  It's not necessarily that they don't want to give up this tiny extra profitability boost (although that could be part of it) but it would be a major expense to replace all their FPGAs.
Feel free to reply with corrections, I'm happy to learn new info if I'm wrong.  Just trying to turn this back to facts and away from and us-vs-those-evil-guys mentality.
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:44:18
Oh man, I wish I knew what info to trust since this stuff is a big deal.  But since many posts and comments are removed this is certainly not a free marketplace of ideas.  Calling someone a "hero" sounds like propaganda but then again if it's all true he really is.
The downside of information curation is that honest dudes like me don't know who to trust anymore.

Look out, next stop is the market cap of gold at $7.07 trillion dollars!

Um, b/c most people aren't developers
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:01:57
Yeah, good point that "democracy is not a truth machine."  I try to use people's incentives to figure out who I can trust (or at least what arguments of theirs may be biased) and in that context this info that SegWit could have major ramifications on miner hardware is enlightening.   
At this point I my understanding is that 1) these incentives are important to know 2) the demonization of BU and miners seems like it's going too far  3) the entrenched interests on both sides are annoying

Cool, thanks

I dont think this is right, b/c it would make LN really lame, but it makes some sense.  I need to read up on this.

unpopular request: show me any evidence for who should have gone to jail?
it's kind of like saying "NOBODY went to jail for the stock market crash of 1989!"
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:48:42
I think your premise is right and your calculations make sense.  
Something this allows you to do then is to take at 24 word seed and split it into two halves and store them in separate locations, without worrying that if someone only found half they could brute force their way to your funds.

The top cryptocurrency will have the most liquidity, be used the most, and therefore have the highest demand and market cap.  So if you want your BTC holdings to be worth the most possible then it should stay in the lead.
