Interesting idea but I think it oversimplifies fee estimation. A one size fits all solution won’t be sufficient and adding bloat to the block headers should be avoided.

I believe this would leave lightning spin to foot the bill for the on chain transaction fee. Can’t expect lightning spin to pay to solve this problem for all of its clients that end up in an illiquid state.

I'm not sure I understand. For you, with that skillset, you can lower the trust required by reviewing the code and bootstrapping from the genesis block. That's great.
For my grandma without that skillset, she gains nothing by validating from the genesis block. It'd be great if she had the option to speed up the bootstrapping process by using a snapshot.

So this is just a guy whose computer crashed and then he lost money? That’s too bad. I hope his channel partners were all trustworthy guys and returned his lost funds.

Everybody has to run their own always on node in LN
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:51:21
That's great and code should be open, but not everybody has that skillset.  If you can code and have a few months to review the code thoroughly more power to you.  Don't start from a snapshot.  Hopefully you can even improve on the code after that effort!  But it shouldn't be a requirement and we shouldn't assume everybody's doing that.

You could still verify the number of Bitcoin in the UTXO is &lt;= to the expected # based on the block height. 
I think point is that, especially when running pre-compiled binaries like most people do, a certain amount of trust in the code is implicit. Given this, there is little gained by not including a snapshot.  Furthermore, the network could be leveraged so that you could only be fooled by a malicious developer if a majority of the network is complicit.  Seems like a good approach if you want to make running a network node easy to do.

But an alternative client can’t be guaranteed to keep consensus with Bitcoin Core. Probably best to just use Bitcoin Core directly, not Bitcore.

Have you managed to make a payment with more than three hops yet? Curious how route finding through non-hubs is working in practice

Clearly we’re talking past each other somehow. It sounds like we largely agree. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:35:15
Ok I think I better understand what you’re saying, but I’m not sure it’s an important distinction. If your machine is compromised and the wallet can be manipulated into sending all its money to any address without a decryption key, who cares about the private keys? The goal of security isn’t to protect your private keys, it’s to protect your funds. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:31:15
I don’t think there is an easy answer. In a world where everybody is running a LN node everybody will have to get substantially better about data security than they have been historically. Or else they’ll have to trust a third party with the appropriate skill set to transmit their money on their behalf, which would likely be the safer approach.  
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:46:44
Oh I totally agree. I’m not saying snapshots should be forced on anybody. But I like it as an option because it would be very useful for most basic users without degrading their security, since they already have to trust the developers.

Half the fee related posts here are PSAs about how low fee transactions are being confirmed and the other half are about how the network is being spammed with low fee transactions. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:04:48
I understand the concern, but if they don’t understand the trade off they’re already stuck in a position of trusting the developers. The extra CPU cycles and bandwidth of validating from Genesis doesn’t fix that. 
And a significant portion (I’ve read upwards of 90%) of bandwidth associated with running a node comes from bootstrapping new nodes, supplying them with old blocks. If more new nodes used snapshots it would reduce the bandwidth requirements associated with running a node.

Got it. I haven’t dabbled with LN. fun to see people’s success with the off-chain payment channel side of things. Looking forward to seeing how the network side of the system develops.

That would be interesting and certainly possible. Coinbase was definitely unprepared for fees to jump up like that and at one point they had lost millions in unspendable utxos. I imagine they too are looking at this as a temporary opportunity to reclaim a portion of that. 
But I think it’s more than just coinbase. Years ago people were encouraged to use mixers and to split transactions into many utxos to improve fungibility. All the people who did that years ago may be taking advantage of the opportunity to consolidate and reclaim a portion of their funds as well. Bottom line, high fees followed by relatively low fees are likely to cause a lot of consolidation transactions from a lot of parties.

It’s a critical requirement of the LN protocol, not a bug. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:04:39
You COULD do that, but that would require a human in the loop. If you’re routing a significant number of transactions you would have a full time job typing in your password. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:59:31
The node has to be able to sign all transactions routed through it. Programatic access is the only practical approach. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:04:57
I would say it’s a very hot wallet. A standard hot wallet keeps keys encrypted. LN nodes require keys in cleartext, so it’s less secure than a standard hot wallet.

Segwit isn’t a code optimization scaling solution. It’s a block size increase.

If he has his coins in a paper wallet he doesn’t want to use them, LN or not. It’s fair to say he’s fine to do nothing. The only reason to move them is if he expects fees to be higher again in the future than they are now. 
He’d be paying for twice as many transactions that way, but if fees go up hopefully the 60% discount the code gives to segwit transactions will more than make up for the additional transaction.

It’s a natural response to reduced fees. A huge portion of bitcoin had become unspendable as fees rose (“dust” transactions). As fees have come down people are consolidating these dust transactions, which creates very large transactions due to the many inputs.
Evidently people believe the low fee situation is temporary and they’re taking advantage of the opportunity to consolidate their sub $100 utxos.

Mining difficulty wouldn’t adjust though. Or at least it would take millennia for that to happen.
