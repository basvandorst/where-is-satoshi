Yes it does :)

Thanks for the help, I appreciate it!

This is great, again, thanks for the help.

Thank you, I really appreciate the help :)

Perhaps this is a stupid question, but how does this effect coins on a paper wallet? Is there anything specific I need to do to prepare for the fork?

I had no idea he / bitmain was a proponent of b2x. Thank you for helping me avoid giving them money!

I'm with you! What I'm wondering is if it will be worth mining the original BTC chain, not segwit2x. Is there something I'm missing? Thank you.

I have a ledger and love it. I had absolutely no issues with setup and it feels so good to have my BTC safe after far too long on various paper and software wallets. I haven't tried the Trezor but that looks great too.

This is really interesting, and that's exactly what I was wondering. Would you mind elaborating on the issue with Bitmain? That's something I know nothing about. Is there a good alternative? 
Thank you!

I successfully sold my BCH on Kraken very recently and withdrew to a canadian account. I haven't tried it for BTC but I imagine it will work fine. I asked support a question in the process and they were really helpful. I was verified within a day.

Since you're a student and I'm guessing that a hardware wallet is out of budget I would suggest getting your bitcoins secured on a paper wallet if you are confident that you can secure the paper wallet physically. That way you will have your own keys so your BTC will be safe with the upcoming, and any other, fork. 
 is a good resource to help with making that happen.

Oh of course! I don't know how I missed that. Thank you.

Thanks so much for your help, I really appreciate it. Regarding number 5, I didn't realise at the time of asking the question that the ledger app gives you a QR code you can use to receive coin. For some reason I thought it only gave you the public key as a string of text.

I did know that the reward halves every so often but I hadn't considered how that applies long term. I'm super grateful for all of the help in this thread. It's really helping to tie things together for me. Thank you!

This is a basic concept that I still don't quite understand. What happens when all coins are mined and there's no incentive for the miners to be confirming transactions?

Another new owner here, I'd tried to get set up one one of the mainstream exchanges a number of times over the past few months and each time ended up giving up (it's pretty difficult here in the UK)
Ended up biting the bullet and paying the big markup on local bitcoin just before the $1200 high. I've got 3.6 coin now and I'm feeling slightly nervous but for the most part optimistic!

I think so too. And to be honest I'm in for the long haul. But that's essentially all of my savings so it's still a bit nerveracking!
