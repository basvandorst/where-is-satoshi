Yes because everything else is losing value too fast.

This is an internet community. We aren't banging at your door to tell you to hodl. No one forced you to come to this sub. If you don't like the opinions of the people here you are free to leave. 
That being said. How does people telling you to hodl even remotely close to being a ponzi scheme. Most of it is being directed at people considering panic selling. Which is almost always a bad decision. Especially for new people who have no fucking clue what the hell they are doing with a virtual currency.  Some poeple here have been told to sell their houses, cars, take out a mortgage to buy into the Bitcoin craze.
If there is anything to take away from the past it is that hodling is the most likely way to guarenteed profits. Besides, the whole point of Bitcoin is to essentially remove the need for fiat monies, and remove the need for centralized currency. Instead of day trading, why not hodl it to use in the future. I doubt anyone day trades the USD here.

Preach it! All hail Bitcoin!

Thank you for providing the correct answer. I did some research on capital gains earlier this week. It lines up with what you have said! However, I do believe if you are within the first (maybe second too?) tax bracket. There is no tax on long term capital gains. At least in the US.

The can make tons of money by charging people for using the more 'convenient method'. Even though a lot of people will still ignore this advice and buy from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:02:15
Why sell? Sou should be buying more!

IMO, we are not even close to the ceiling of what Bitcoin can achieve. I suppose people have their doubts of Bitcoin becoming equal to or greater than gold however, I am not one of those people.
It's not just your average investor getting into Bitcoin atm. There are also banks, billionaires, professional investors, etc. Everyone wants a slice of the pie which is extremely limited considering only so much Bitcoin is available to the market (Someone did the math before I think it was around 900,000), but let's assume 14 million max currently. What happens when the only Bitcoins floating around are people who want to get out at 50,000 , 100,000 , 200,000? There will be a huge surge in the cost Bitcoin that will make what we've seen recently child's play.
The fact of the matter is, there is a limited supply of Bitcoin and there is a huge demand. That is a big part of what is causing the recent gains.
You're right, some of the gains will go away when people sell. That's' supposed to happen, the large fish will gobble up the smaller fish. Eventually it will balance out. The same people who want to get rich quick or buy into huge gains are going to get burnt, unless they hodl. If you truly believe that the big businessmen of the world don't want a huge stake in the market, then we have nothing to talk about.
Worst case scenario, Bitcoin crashes close to zero and big time investors gobble it right back up. Either way I like my odds atm.

Accounts are backed up on a recover sheet and can be recovered to another device or certain wallets.

Easy, he doesn't work! 
Seriously tho, if you put a lot of money on before the jump you easily made about 10k. idk about you but I make about 2k per month in stipends so yeah... 2x5 = 10?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:05:06
4chan will hack the Bitcoin! I saw it on Fox News!
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:33:29
Actually you can make gold, it's just very expensive right now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:35:05
Sell your sweet bitcoin lower than you paid for. More money for me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:15:40
I mean its an offline device. It's probably as safe as putting it on a computer you never connect to the internet. Safer due to backup redundancies. I wouldn't be too worried about someone hacking into my USB drives.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:14
That's because some of their features are down or limited.

WTF are you doing. Transfer to GDAX it's FREE and INSTANT. There is nothing wrong with coinbase if you do your research! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:55
I'll have one with fries!
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:29:05
Isn't gold at like 7.5 trillion market cap? Isn't it possible for Bitcoin to reach the same value? In that case we should be hodling for a 30-40x increase over many years. I might not ever be able to buy a jet, but a fucking house in 20 years would be nice. 
Hodl for life.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:36:55
Tell him to short or STFU. Snowflakes love pulling shit like this when it goes in their favor for five seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:45:19
Pretty sure almost everyone who didn't buy high made money today. Not even worried about the little drop.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:12:22
It's the most magical number!
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:55:05
I just get an erection. I must be doing it wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:41:28
If Bitcoin tanks I'm buying all the Bitcoin. No ragrets. Hodl for life! Beautiful speech!
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:18:23
It's not just valuable because it's decentralized. It's also extremely scarce, there will ever only be 21 million BTC A good chunk of that is either gone for good or hoarded. Also crypto is generally not affected by the downsides of a global currency. Plus anyone with lots of money wouldn't want to keep 100% of it in US banks and a single currency. While it might not be the ultimate answer for GC right now there is certainly the possibility of it happening in some form.

It's not a story the hodlers would tell you.

Hodl till it hits triple digits. Buy an island.

Big dollar yes, but the education is probably worse than 30 years ago when it was 800/semester.
