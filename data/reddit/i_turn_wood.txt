put in all $500 and don't spend your BTC for 10 years.  do you have the patience to invest for the long term?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:37:00
look at your transactions carefully, maybe you added a transaction fee that  wiped out your balance.

so staged, why did this have to set up as an interview when it clearly was not done in real time?

I dont' think you understand my question.   MtGox and other exchanges are used to exchange fiat currency to bitcoins and vice versa.   The bitcoin protocol is used to send and receive bitcoin only.   
Bitcoin has verified peers, each node contains the full ledger of transactions in the blockchain and confirmations from at least 6 nodes provides enough initial verification of a transaction to make it trusted.
So how is your scheme different?  
@_date: 2013-04-06 07:23:40
it is a slower market right now and the ease of getting USD into an account doesn't offset that.   if you have bitcoin to put into your bitfloor account you could play arbitrage between it and mtgox.

The returns on GPU mining is diminishing, soon to be miniscule.   The GTX560i gets a max of 100 megahashes per second according to this chart:   and that is not going to make you much bitcoin per day unfortunately.
Look into the mining pools like BTC Guild, 50BTC or Slush.
For a wallet go to bitcoin.org for the original client or blockchain.info for an online wallet.

GPU mining is way less profitable now that ASICs are online.   Your only chance of making fractions of a bitcoin per day is to join a mining pool.  use one of the minging calculators to determine your ROI, you can start here

miners will continue to collect transaction fees which will be in greater number due to increased volume of transactions and possible higher fees.

the bitcoins would still exist in the blockchain.  if someone had stored their private keys on paper they could technically get their btc back

if you think $20 is the right value then place limit orders for $20 on one of the exchanges and stop looking at the price.  check your order status and move the coins to your wallet when the order(s) are executed.

is your plan to ultimately gain fiat or bitcoin?  
regarding its bright future, what do you think the price of a single bitcoin will be in 2140 after the last one is mined?  you and i will never know because we will be dead, but assuming bitcoin survives there will be billions of people using it and only 21 million coins.

can the government seize my paypal funds?  can i send money anonymously to my friend in china or north korea? how fast?  what are the fees?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:24:47
i have only used Bitfloor, here are my observations:
1. relatively easy to get USD into my account.
2. making market and limit buys were easy.
3. easy to move bitcoins from Bitfloor to my local wallet.
1. servers were down during critical buying and selling times, but this was not only a bitfloor problem, mt gox was down or laggy during these times as well.
2. their market data page is slow and lacking enough data to make informed trades.
have not tried to sell bitcoins yet, i don't plan to sell for a long time.

bitcoin goes in and does not come out.

*"Unlike mtgox which centralizes of all bitcoin trades, enabling extreme government regulation, my idea uses a different scheme of incentivized and verified peer to peer network of people to verify and transfer deals made with bitcoin."*
The bitcoin protocol already does this.  Are you talking about a decentralized currency exchange? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:57:49
that is what bitcoin was designed to do.  it is anonymous, tax free and point to point.  mt gox is just an exchange to get your fiat into btc and vice versa.  the bitcoin protocol is designed to be person to person without a middleman- govt., broker, exchange or other intermediary.
@_date: 2013-04-15 07:04:21
this is incorrect.  each block mints bitcoin.   please read

Pool mining with video cards (GPU) doesn't pay much at all these days  and it will only get worse as more ASICS come online.  Also, you have virtually no chance of creating a block and earning BTC by self mining.
However, mining does serve a very valuable service to the bitcoin system (block creation) and mining will never go away.

Showing the two side by side really hits home and i get the message, but "Plan B" sounds too much like birth control unless you can associate it with having fubar'd the first time ala the Ben Bernanke meme.

the mining difficulty went up today to 7,673,000 which means if you are in a pool you will make less per share (other things being equal).  
however, if you are saying that your BTC balance went down then you either spent 0.0074 and/or added a transaction fee or something nefarious happened.

you should submit this to @_date: 2013-04-09 06:25:16
the blockchain.info wallet is used by many.  Make sure your password is long (at least 12 chars) and do not forget the password or you are completely hosed. 
if you download the bitcoin-qt wallet client you can back up your wallet.dat file on cloud storage like Dropbox and/or you can copy to a USB drive that should be kept off premises.

i believe bitfloor has other means of getting USD to them but using the Bank of America option is easy and you don't need to have an account with BofA to do it.   LocalTill is a company that works with Bank of America to handle the deposits.
First you create an account on bitfloor.com and then go to the deposit page  
You indicate how much you want to deposit in USD and it creates an instruction sheet for you to take to B of A, which includes the total amount including fees (small) and LocalTill account number that the bank teller needs.   At the BofA branch ( you pick up an out of state deposit slip on one of the tables and fill it out with the details from your instruction sheet and hand to the teller.
You cash will be deposited in your bitfloor account pretty fast.
