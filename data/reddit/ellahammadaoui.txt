it should be dropped from the mempool after 14 days (tomorrow?). Unfortunately Spammers and malicious people will rebroadcast it. Try to track/view it with other explorers
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:47:23
It can be done at the wallet level: wallet broadcasts txs only to honest miners. I know each mining pool/block explorer has a different version of the mempool.

yep if we count the block reward, they are paying roughly 120$ per tx
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:24:11
That's the actual cost of the transaction (inflation adjusted). Miners are paid to process tx and SECURE the network.
If you don't pay them 12.5 block reward, do you think they will still process 1cent transaction?

Can't agree more. Used to complain about fees. When I saw the BCH pump/hashrate attack of Nov 12th, I changed my mind seeing the amounts of BTC being sent to exchanges and fees being spent (1 block has more fees than the 12.5 BTC reward). It was like a self-defense mechanism vs such attacks.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:50:46
villain miners are putting more hashrate to increase next difficulty adjustment. In 2 days, they will pull off that hashrate and leave honest miners with higher diff. and potentioally spam tx.

They are trying to harm the legacy fork in the following way:
* 1- in ~4 days difficulty increase by 38%, they add adequate hashpower to make sure next retarget will increase difficulty
* 2- in ~18 days, redo step 1
* 3- in ~32 days, miners on the legacy chain will face a huge hash difficulty that was artificially inflated.

i'm pretty sure some hodlers do sell 25-50% at ath.and probably buy back same amount at the dips.

we already had 5 consecutive difficulty increases  , despite (Bcash annoyance). So if it keeps increasing in the  next 3 retargets into the fork, it's gonna favor S2x.
