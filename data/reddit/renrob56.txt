its all about supply and demand since there isn't a unlimited amount of bitcoins so when more people buy prices should go up 
look at last monday when coinbase launched all of a sudden there was a big demand for bitcoins and the price spiked also people started selling on the spike which caused a dip 
i'm not an expert just speculating
