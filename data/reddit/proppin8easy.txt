Funny how the UAE starts caring about human rights once money is on the line.

So one of the interesting yet unlikely thoughts I have had is that the success of bitcoin will also necessitate a transition from governing assuming demand-side economics to supply-side economics. We shall see.

Ahh that's part of this whole equation I did not understand. The ability to improve and change the currency is of vital importance.

Thank you for the info!

More of, when bitcoin prices are rising quickly, will it cause many people to hold their bitcoins and cause said inflation to slow or reverse. I honestly think its possible from a theoretical standpoint. So long as there are alternate crypto or FIAT currencies to spend during these high inflation periods, people will hold bitcoins. This will slow or reverse inflation. this could lead to either a self-leveling market, or a highly volatile market.

So through this method you could potentially com up with improvements to the system. Altho the problem would be getting the users to agree on the enhancements.

I appreciate this. I am unfamiliar with the concept of forking. can you provide a little clarification.

Inflation of a currency is driven by supply and velocity (rates at which currency exchanges hands). If the velocity or supply increases, the inflation ,  takes place. If velocity decreases, the currency tends towards deflation or stagnation. So lets propose a series of scenarios. 
1.THE BAD  There is a rapid period of inflation because everyone is spending their bitcoins. Since there in inflation (currency is de-valued), there is little incentive to hold on to any savings and therefore velocity will increase driving a constant cycle of inflation. However, this can be offset by more goods being in the market, the more goods that are available and desired that can be exchange for bitcoin,  given that bitcoin has a finite supply, the more bitcoin will be worth. The only problem with this model is that if i get into bitcoin and purchase some with a fiat currency, I have to spend it quickly so that the value will not go away. 
       This would create a disincentive to bring goods to market and accept bitcoin, because I would have to spend my revenue right away or it would lose value. therefore, the only way to combat inflation (currency de-valuation) is to bring more goods to the bitcoin market, an activity with a heavy disincentive. 
2. THE GOOD Few people are spending their bitcoins. This would tend to lead to a deflationary condition in which the remaining bitcoins in circulation would rise in value. This would provide incentive for me to bring goods to market and accept bitcoin, driving further deflation (currency goes up in value). As the currency goes up in value, there are more people in the market and deflation continues at a more rapid pace. as long as population continues to increase and demand for good increases, this deflation will continue and held bitcoins will increase in value.  
My point is that once bit coin sees any sort of real inflation, it may be doomed. To permanent devaluation so long as there are alternatives. I fear we may be at that point now because of the big spike last year.

Thanks! I added some encryption so that my employees would have to use at least 2 of three changing keys to send money from the company account. I may make this software open source if i can guarantee it will not compromise my system security.
