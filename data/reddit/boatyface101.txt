I'm assuming you mean if Bitcoin replaces Fiat... Let's say the British pound right?
So you've got a wallet of Bitcoin that your employer pays into. You go to a bank or lending service that has loads of Bitcoin... You say you wanna borrow some, they do the due diligence and approve the loan. They give you the Bitcoin which you pay back with interest.
Function exactly the same as Fiat does today. Only it'll be quicker and far simpler. Possibly cheaper too cos peer to peer lending will be even bigger than it is now.
I don't see this happening though... You'll be using USDT or GBPT.

It can take a bit of time to arrive.
Why did you send it to GDAX first?
Have you double checked all the addresses were correct I.e was it a BTC receiving address?
Have you put the transaction ID into block explorer? Does anything show up?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:19:38
I’m a freelance designer too, have been thinking about the same thing.

It’s a bit convoluted at the moment... you have to link your revolut and coinbase accounts then send Eur to coinbase, then on to GDAX.

@_date: 2017-12-03 22:25:19
I don’t use the bank account aspect... just buy Euro and send it to GDAX. Never had any issues with the app or service.
But you’re absolutely right, I should have done more due diligence before I started sending large sums of money through it... just took it on recommendation from someone else.
Will have a look online and see what I can find too.

It is counterintuitive... It's designed to be a currency but it's still a new technology. Over time this will hopefully change but who knows. It may end up being a store of value and stable coins will be the currency.

Thank you internet friend.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:34:50
Is that true?!? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:35:37
I have no background in trading or finance so my personal opinion is exactly that... an opinion. 
I think crypto as a whole is most likely in a bubble, in the grand scheme of things there is very little adoption and every investment is speculative based on the potential of tokens as a future currency and ICOs as future corporations.
Similarly to the dot com bubble, people were investing speculatively in the adoption of the internet as infrastructure and potential promise of companies like amazon, google etc.
That said I think we’re a long way off the bubble ‘bursting’. In a few years, once institutional money has flowed in on mass and retail investors have become more aware of the ecosystem... that will be the time to start questioning cashing out.
Once the industry crashes we’ll most likely see the vast majority of current platforms disappear but a select few with either the most relevant use cases or highest adoption rates will recover and begin a new trend upwards.
The trick now is to try and figure out which platforms have the most longevity which requires constant research and diligence and at best.... guesswork.
IMO the traditional market will crash long before the crypto market and that may well push the crypto market to the brink. Hopefully by that point I’ll have enough value in my portfolio to cash out and pay off my house... that’s my moon.
To the moon friend, to the moon! ����

@_date: 2019-06-28 09:56:29
With mass adoption people won't be using exchanges though. Exchanges will be used by institutions who then pass BTC (either real or paper) onto consumers. Unless they're hedge funds or investment firms, these institutions have a responsibility to hold the asset safe thereby increasing stability. This is why people say we're still on the early stages of adoption.

Exactly, Bitcoin will hopefully stabilise eventually but we need a LOT More liquidity to flow into it. 
I could be absolutely wrong about this and I’m well aware of the repercussions.
After lightening network is fully enabled, bitcoin could be adopted as an everyday currency as intended or the market could focus on IOTA’s tangle technology which may make bitcoins blockchain redundant. Who knows? 
But it’s exciting to be involved and my long term strategy should hopefully shield me from too many losses if all goes to shit.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:31:05
Why would a mass run on BTC have detrimental effects to society? Cash is still king and will be for a long time yet. The only reason people would adopt BTC on mass and in a sudden is if something fundamentally went wrong with the traditional marketplace and BTC offered the solution... for which is it was designed to do.
I buy into bitcoin both as a financial investment and because I believe in the technology. Whether it can withstand the test of time is yet to be seen but I honestly believe if it has an impact on society as a whole it’ll be a positive one. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:09:17
Please correct me if I’m wrong: once support for B2X is made available I.e wallets etc you can use the same private key as your BTC  to connect to your B2X and move it where ever you want. Right?

I think the point is as adoption / awareness grows the order book will grow with it. Each time a whale dumps, their BTC will be distributed more widely across a larger population thus reducing their ability to manipulate. 
Could be wrong though... Happy to be corrected.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:45:38
Yes... the price of bitcoin is going up because the price of bitcoin is going up. If the price of bitcoin were going down then the price of bitcoin would be going down because the price of bitcoin is going down. But it’s not going down it’s going up, it’s going up because it’s going up.

Precisely, market sentiment is the main motivator for price movement but I’m not riding the bubble so to speak. 
With Bitcoin I’m invested as a store of value because I personally don’t see it being adopted as the mainstream currency of the future. But future markets will require a stable base such as gold is now. That’s how I see bitcoin... future digital gold.
With other currencies such as Monero, Ethereum, Vertcoin... I’m invested in their potential as I see these as having a future use case either as platforms or day to day currencies.
I won’t be timing the market regardless of a crash or correction, I don’t have enough time to watch markets that closely so I will just hold my investment throughout and add to it when prices drop/dip.

If you use a service like coinbase you can buy and store it safely with ease. If you want a little more security its just a simple case of downloading a reputable wallet like Exodus and storing it on there.
I've helped so many people get into crypto and not one of them has ever had funds lost or stolen.
The problem is when people try and get smart to avoid fees or leave their funds on questionable exchanges. 
Gateways into crypto are improving every month and custodial services are becoming more secure so for those who find it overwhelming it'll definitely get easier.

Coinbase is an exchange so you don't have access to the private key, meaning you don't have sole access to your bitcoin. All their tokens are stored on their own addresses and your ownership is just a record on a ledger much like the traditional banking system. 
In a paper wallet, you and only you have access to the private keys to your bitcoin. Meaning no-one else can claim ownership of it. Your ownership is again recorded on a ledger but as youre the only one with the private key, only you can access and send your bitcoin.
Private key = maximum security

@_date: 2019-01-02 22:23:19
I use a Ledger so can't comfortably recommend a safe paper wallet. You obviously want it quick so do a quick search of Reddit and you'll find the same question asked 
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:35:10
With a decentralised system, people need to be rewarded for participation. Hence why attaching value to coins. Awesome, that makes total sense. Thanks!

@_date: 2017-09-27 22:21:35
How much have YOU made or lost? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:12:05
Thanks for your replies... so it was essentially created to make transactions more secure, transparent, uncorrupt etc using the ledger, and tokens are required to interact with this ledger. 
But companies developing protocols that allow maybe; the storage of data or files in the blockchain as a decentralised 'dropbox'... this isn't a 'money' but tokens are still bought and sold. In this case, is the monetisation simply a means of investment? Surely you could remove the money aspect and hand out tokens to users and still achieve the same end goal... minus a few lambos. 
Sorry again if these questions are naive.

That's what I'm interested in... does tether appreciate/depreciate? If the crypto market suddenly crashes will tether be safe or is it better to withdraw to fiat?

I’m assuming wallets will issue instructions on how to claim the new coin in given time?

Looked in to this, so its peer2peer trading right? How easy/quick is it to use? Is the exchanging similar to sites like Bittrex where you set your buy price and wait for it to be filled? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:41:48
I’d jump on board if you need some graphics done. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:27:44
Everyone’s BTC value would drop and you’d have a bunch of angry Lambo drivers who can’t afford petrol

He’s probably right... but he’s wrong until he’s right.... and according to google he’s been wrong for a while 
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:42:54
Just.... wow 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:36:09
Do you really think BTC could rocket up if there was another financial crash? Would that not affect cryptos negatively as well? 
I know that cryptos aren’t intrinsically tied to traditional markets but surely all the big whales out there would panic and start pulling their investments in crypto to try and keep themselves/businesses a float.

If I were you I’d stay away from ALL gambling and perhaps investing in general. If you can’t resist the urges to “win it back” then develop a rigid strategy and stick to it or else you’re gonna lose a shit ton on money. Good luck buddy.

This is the ultimate example of emotional trading and FOMO. In 5 years time when alts like NEO and OMG are potentially where BTC is now you’ll make another post chastising people for encouraging you to put everything into Bitcoin.

Thanks for your replies... so it was essentially created to make transactions more secure, transparent, uncorrupt etc using the ledger, and tokens are required to interact with this ledger. 
But companies developing protocols that allow maybe; the storage of data or files in the blockchain as a decentralised 'dropbox'... this isn't a 'money' but tokens are still bought and sold. In this case, is the monetisation simply a means of investment? Surely you could remove the money aspect and hand out tokens to users and still achieve the same end goal... minus a few lambos. 
Sorry again if these questions are naive.

Am I right in thinking coinbase take ownership of your key as they ask for a copy of your ID rather than issue a 12 word pass phrase?
If that's the case then they're kinda already doing what you suggest in a smartly designed interface.
You're right though, a lot of streamlining is needed for mass adoption but it needs to be done by the community and not by Apple lol 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:42:37
Fair enough... stupid question, stupid answer 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:47:57
Most likely BTC. ����
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:56:35
What’s the next best thing for buying BTC.... coin base was so easy!
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:38:16
Do you cash out to fiat or tether or another coin? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:08:55
Exodus wallet are pretty clear with Segwit2X and it’ll be safe in there 
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:03:21
This is true to a degree... Solid small caps can out pace BTC in growth over the short term but as we just saw when the market crashes it's alts that get hammered most. 
Always hold some bitcoin but don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify and take profits as you go.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:44:14
No fraud in Fiat!? Yah ok then... 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:52:10
You got a link or something?!

I'm no expert. I've done stupid shit. I've bought high. I've sold low. I'm not a financial advisor. But... I would maybe wait till it's comfortably above 8k before chucking more cash at it to be on the safe side maybe? We've been here before and it dumped hard after failing to pass resistance.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:04:38
Yeh there is logic to that, all your coinbase funds are insured so they'll pay out in the event they're at fault... Supposedly. It's not government backed so there are some question marks.
All depends on your confidence in storing on your own wallet. I personally have most of my funds on a Ledger but do keep some on coinbase just for ease of access and also havnt bothered moving it.
If you're talking crazy money then buy a Ledger or something... Small price to pay.

It's still early days for the whole ecosystem. Adoption means people using cryptocurrencies without even realising. 
When I have to remind my dad he just bought something using crypto I'll know adoption is finally here.
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:07:23
Basically buy low, sell high

Dunno... He had me at Bitcoin.

Nomnomnom.... Buying BTC with debt. I smell a bullrun.
Just kidding, don't do it. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:48:17
Ledger is a brand, they make a secure hardware wallet. Give them a Google.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:03:14
Do you need the 150 bucks? If not fuck it... You've already lost most of it. Just leave it there and see what happens
