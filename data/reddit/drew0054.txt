Fun experiment: Install Python, then run it in a console. Then try this:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; 1+1+1==3
        True
        &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.1+0.1+0.1==0.3
        False
        &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.1+0.1+0.1
        0.30000000000000004
And that's why you never store financial information as floats.

Stock splits are nothing new. Same thing happened to Apple. About a year ago, used to be almost $600, now it's around $100. Nobody thinks Apple actually lost that much value, they just know that they had a 7:1 split a few months ago. Nobody lost their shirt.
FWIW, I don't think it would be a bad idea to move the decimal point over one. Effectively have a 10:1 BTC split. Of course the number of satoshis stays the same, there's just 10% as many per BTC and there's 10x as many BTC in circulation. Being a money (not float) datatype, the decimal point is aesthetic, anyways.

Would a bitcoin stock exchange be tax free? If BTC is property and stocks are property, every transaction will be "In-kind".

Congrats! You're more qualified to run a Forex brokerage than some of the biggest players in the business.

P2P lending doesn't need Bitcoin to exist... Actually, Interactive Brokers offers the same thing for stockholders, ability to earn interest from short sellers.

You're comparing apples and uranium...

Derivatives can be used as a speculative play, but they can also be used as hedges. I personally would have enjoyed being able to write covered calls a year ago.

You don't want to know the sausage factory that is the financial industry. For one, FIX protocol,  used by everyone, including NASDAQ. That's it. No XML, no JSON. Just FIX.

I know that, but I was wondering if perhaps the algorithm needed a longer number or something. I'm not familiar with guts of encryption/hashing algorithms rather just the principles/applications.

If you transfer to an offline wallet the coins are still there. Rule  of Bitcoin is that you don't need to be online to receive a transaction.

This thread made me create an account. Good job OP.

Aren't paper wallets supposed to be for long term storage? How do you know if it's in a landfill or a safe?

How many random numbers are needed to generate a key? You can generate 256 random bits with a 16 sided die in 32 rolls.

So are options and futures...
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:24:35
Okay, so there'd no incentive to mine, right? But you really want to send a transaction, so you add a transaction fee. Someone will mine a block for that transaction fee. There's the demand, and the supply picking it up. Rinse, repeat, recycle.

Have those returns been realized? Can you sell off your entire wallet without moving the price &gt;$1? No, there's no economic basis, just speculation that there will be an economy.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:29:05
Keep in mind the economy for Bitcoin is still really weak and the Coin is trading like a penny stock. You can save a good $30 at times with proper limit orders. Don't get greedy or fearful and buy or sell at market rates.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:15:36
Yeah, price isn't equal to success, otherwise the USD would be 10x stronger than JPY. Stability is. Ultimately the high volatility kills it as a currency and makes it a penny stock. The fundamentals haven't changed since the beginning of the month, though the price has doubled. The buy and hold is stupid if you're trying to grow a currency.
@_date: 2013-09-27 00:36:08
Thank you for the reply. It's only real time and one way (can only input USD for buying). Thank you though. I fear that's probably the best I'll get. I doubt I could find it if it was a major FOREX pair. FWIW, right now $220,000 would buy ~1,578 BTC with ~28.6 BTC lost through slippage.
Limit orders and dollar-cost averaging, my friend!

Lack of liquidity sucks. One person makes a big move and totally blows the spread apart. This not an[ efficient market]( The players want to partake but can't. Needs more scalpers.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:19:10
It will take a somewhat big event, not a sell wall, unless it causes whales to dump.

I run Bitcoin-qt. I have a mirror of the blockchain on my hard disk. I don't see a dime of the Tx fees. Hard disk space has nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:51:21
Why is there even a fee expected at this point in the game? Is 25 BTC not enough? The whole goal at this stage of Bitcoin's life is adoption and any associated fees are a drag on spending and the economy.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:04:01
Yes, exactly, 
And use limit orders, you can get in cheaper and it adds liquidity instead of volatility to the market.

@_date: 2013-11-14 00:52:14
Or mine your own block. Then you can choose any transactions you want.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:55:18
Miners already get 25 BTC. The whole point is that it's an incentive to mine blocks, the basis of Bitcoin. It's just throttling the network out of greed.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:08:40
Then make the transaction fee 1 Satoshi. Still effectively free and spammers lose money. 0.00005 is still $0.02 at $400/BTC. I'm thinking two more zeroes would be good, 0.0000005/$0.0002.
