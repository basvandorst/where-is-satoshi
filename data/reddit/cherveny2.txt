I prefer the name PonziCoin :)

I actually called it PonziCoin on a guess the name thread at GAW'S hashtalk. Somehow I avoided the banhammer :)

I'm in your situation.  I decided to try ASIC mining so tried an ant and a fury and tried it hosted, seeing their promise you could have it shipped to you at any time.  Then hashlets started. I was a bit skeptical but it looked like better returns were promised,  so made the mistake of converting.   
Then they stated the primes vs solo vs genesis split.  Then the zenpool "being negotiated" which dropped pay rates to nothing.   Plus the total LACK of transparency for other pools and how much is being paid in pool fees. Worth it being so opaque,  they could be skimming any amount they wished of the top and you'd never know!  Plus they never disclose on the scrypt mining how much litecoin you earned,  what transaction rate they sold it for to bitcoin, again leaving no transparency! 
The final straw for me was the hashcoin nonsense.  It smells so much to me,  I'm expecting it to be a giant ponzi scheme.   Especially with the history up to this point just getting shadier and shadier.  
I finally was able to sell off my genesis hashlets without losing too much. Still have to get rid of my primes.   Still undecided if this had put me off mining for good,  but this being my first taste of bit coin has soured my opinion a bit.
I hope people are able to get out in time before getting cheated too bad.
I am thinking of keeping in small hashlet, to see this out to the bitter end and see what happens.   But think now it's not worth it to keep most in place.

Wow.  I had (stupidly) converted hardware earlier to hashlets.  Hadn't heard they had dumped the hardware hosting now.
