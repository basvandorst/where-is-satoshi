that is how markets work -- they don't move in straight lines and this is quite mild compared to the 2014-2015 bear market which was brutal to live through. Also just to correct you there can be manipulation up as well but you wouldn't make this same post would you ? How is that if we are going up then it is all "oh it is because crypto is revolutionary and going to take over everything" but when it is going down it has to be "manipulation" -- if you can stomach this you are right just tap the mat and quit it isn't for you.

I will make this simple for you -- the socialized loss system has nothing to do with whether an exchange is running fractal reserve or not -- it is in fact a completely irrelevant conversation in terms of the socialized loss system and the liquidation being discussed here. Any exchange on planet earth could be running a fractal reserve we have no idea -- the socialized loss system was designed to lock profits for that period so that is the only pool of BTC that losses can be socialized against -- that doesn't apply to deposits. It is a very very common misunderstanding over the years that people could just withdraw funds to avoid the socialized losses but that isn't possible because profits are locked.
I am well known in the space and have interviewed and been on hangouts with every major exchange -- been on popular trading podcasts years ago and exchanges even pay me hundreds of thousands of dollars to consult for them on their products and systems so it is YOU that doesnt understand not me.
Edit: also you must not understand how OKEX works -- it is only very recently they even offered a fiat withdrawal option so they are very much more likely to receive crypto withdrawals not fiat -- most people arent going to want to KYC for the fiat option and the platform's value is it's futures market that doesnt even need a fiat gateway but please keep trying to tell me how much you understand exchanges when you didn't even know that important detail.

socialized losses is a way an exchange can offer high leverage without doing KYC and without putting the entire solvency of the exchange at risk -- you forget that if you blow up on CME or any broker and you have a negative balance they will take you to collections, sue you in court and garnish your wages and bank account if you don't pay. Crypto has and will continue to offer offshore options and evolve with more creative options like BitMEX currently does.

\&gt; Irresponsible actions by the exchange causing losses
for 4 years the system has worked very well with not so frequent clawbacks-- even BitMEX with no customers back in 2015 had to abandon their initial strategy and copy the OKC model. But OKC has been in decline for many years now as they diverted resources to other projects and ignored and neglected the exchange side of things. I wrote about the dangers of that 3 years ago when they made that decision: [
Furthmore, this is more of a function of the loss of liquidity on OKC then it is a system related issue -- it is true they could have applied position limits sooner though so yeah they certainly have responsibility in that aspect.
OKC has far less impact on the markets compared to what it once did -- and all you did in your response is deflect -- any exchange anywhere that doesn't have full reserves could be met with a bank run for any reason. You bitched at me twice of "did I even read the article" well this thread has been about THE LIQUIDATION not what if scenarios down the road that could be valid for literally any exchange in the space. I am pretty sure this your soft pivot way of realizing you don't understand the system in place and how it works -- which is the purpose of this whole post.
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:42:17
you have no idea what you are talking about, best to not speak -- the whole point of the socialized loss system is you it doesn't depend on the exchange itself providing the funds to fill the gap -- socialized losses like the name implies will haircut those that made profits in the period.
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:55:50


I actually agree with this -- that is also why they came out several weeks ago about the upcoming changes to the system which includes position limits.


I am not disputing this point.


Sure that **could** happen -- just like any exchange out there could have a major fuck up and experience the same thing -- it is not specific to OKEX, the socialized loss system, or the current thread that was about the liquidation. 


well again you don't seem to understand the evolution of OKC into OKEX and even OKEX -- it is only very recently they even offered a fiat withdrawal option what so ever, it is rarely used and most traders aren't going to KYC to use it when the futures market they are using doesn't even require them to have fiat at all -- the collateral is all crypto not fiat.


OKEX is not nearly at the market share it once was and not even close to the market share of MtGox when it went down -- it is not even a worthy comparison.
@_date: 2018-08-03 09:52:43
Bro, we have been talking about The Liquidation -- that IS the context -- a context of a near flawless system for 4 years (which you apparently are oblivious to). Your lack of understanding of the system has you making vague claims that really have nothing to do with the situation. You sir are the one that doesn't understand -- go back to noob land before you step up to an elder that was in the space years before you ever heard of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:27:44


yeah I have talked to swapman nearly every day for the last 4 years. In fact we have an ongoing discussion in the private telegram channels with all the OGs of crypto so this isn't a new topic.


yes, OKEX stands to lose even more customers with an event like this but their platform has been in decay for years


I do understand a bank run but that is not the scenario with this liquidation -- you don't seem to be comprehending the mechanics


See you actually lack understanding of how the system works --users can **not** withdraw current profits for the period, they are locked till settlement -- that is the pool of profits that would be subject to socialized losses/clawback -- this is how the system actually is designed to work and why profits can only be withdrawn after the weekly settlement window. The BTC on deposit doesn't matter because all the profits of the current period are accounted for and locked until settlement.
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:40:34
well BitMEX has position limits that don't allow positions over 10,000,000 contracts which is the equivalent of 100,000 contracts on OKEX -- this liquidation was 4,150,000 contracts on OKEX so 41 times larger than the position limit on BitMEX
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:26:43
\&gt; . If the exchange can't cover or guarantee the proceeds of a contract *it shouldn't be offering contracts* or managing them whatsoever.    
NO -- you have literally not a clue what you are talking about -- the socialized loss system that actually has been functioning really well over the last 4 years (up until this week) was an innovation that allowed exchanges to offer very high leverage on BTC without needing to KYC or jeopardize the solvency of the exchange itself. If you do not understand that concept then you do not understand what the system is designed to do.   
\&gt; That's literally the reason the insurance fund exists you moron.   
The insurance fund is there as a buffer and to offset potential socialized losses -- the insurance fund was initially exchange funded as they set aside a couple hundred BTC but then moved to collecting the remaining collateral from liquidated positions (BitMEX does the same exact thing in fact they copied OKC in this regard). The insurance fund doesn't always have the entire amount to offset a socialized loss so that is why clawbacks do occur. You appear not to even understand the mechanism of the insurance fund itself and it's purpose.

pretty sure they can't compel you decrypt your hard drive either 
They formely ordered me to decrypt my data, threatening to charge me with terrorism, and I refused one last time. I was jailed again for a night and new charges were pressed for obstruction (i.e. refusing to help on an investigation).
Then came my turn. The judge summoned me, asked me a few questions, and finally asked: "Why did you encrypt your hard drive?" Think fast. What could I reply!!!
"For safety and privacy, your honor. In case of theft."
"Why do you refuse to decrypt your data?"
The $1,000 question (note: this is not exactly what was said, just how I recall it). What can I say? Quick, a word with a lawyer. Then, the genius answer:
"Your honor I would like to invoke my 5th amendment" "Alright"
Edit: reading your Philly man reference -- yeah that one is going to get messy. He has the ACLU on his side so most likely he should win the appeals somewhere in there. Seems it is more a about the particular judge being stuck on the particular nature of the contents of the HD then actually the 5th amendment rights.
@_date: 2019-11-18 06:04:15
\&gt; If he still refused, he could have been detained indefinitely for contempt of court until he gave up the keys.   
Ummmmmm no.... that isn't how it works. Now sure he could have definitely done more time and you know you can get years of your life back you just can't so the trade off is not an easy one. But this isn't fucking guantanamo bay they can't hold you indefinitely they have to charge you pretty quickly actually -- times might vary but it is usually under 2-3 days otherwise you walk out the front door. They can still charge you later and issue a nasty warrant to come you get you but what you are suggesting just doesn't happen unless you are being held outside of the USA on terrorist related charges.

With all the worthless scam ICOs out there I think there should be an ICO fund that seeks to explicitly fuck with dead beat ICOs and scammers like this and put the fear of God in them. Lol
@_date: 2019-11-18 07:48:47
I wouldn't say it is "well established" -- in all the history of google it has happened what appears 3-4 times.






Your Philly police officer example is certainly an extreme and far from the norm also the guy is certainly going to do time no matter what so he will get credit for time served whenever the actual case gets dealt with. My guess is the court is a bit more willing to let it ride because they already have most of the evidence and he also knows he going to be jail for awhile so is no rush. The ACLU is on his side and they have some serious firepower so I guess we will see how it plays out. I am also guessing if it was an instance where they didn't yet have evidence the pressure on the courts would get wickedly intense -- media and social pressure would come on like a freight train in that instance but no one is in rush to help someone already found with kiddy porn on their other devices.

That isn't entirely how it happens that some Saudi Prince suddenly just wired $250mill to Tether -- what mostly happens is Bitfinex has a float of USDT on reserve that they can allocate to customers upon receiving their incoming wire. When that reserve dips to a certain level Bitfinex wires money to Tether and gets a block like the $250mill to replenish their reserves.

Incorrect, it had much more to do with Carl Mark Force and his partner's involvement in that part of the operation in which the murder for hire was dismissed/not pursued. Not a good look for the FBI when you have to bring your orange jumpsuit wearing in prison former FBI agent to a trial and have the defense and media make it into a laugher field day with all of his testimony and credibility. The FBI just realized it wasn't worth pursuing because they themselves were taking a lot of risk to get ever more exposed and embarrassed.
Source: "No mention of Carl Mark Force IV made it into Ulbricht's trial. Neither did any mention of Shaun Bridges, the former Secret Service agent charged alongside him. The spree of crimes they committed as Silk Road investigators was under the seal of grand jury secrecy at the time. Bridges used the credentials of a Silk Road moderator-turned-informant to rob Dread Pirate Roberts, administrator of Silk Road. Force posed as a hitman and took money from DPR to kill the informant. Force and Bridges then faked the brutal murder of the informant."

it is actually much more complicated then that -- and all the evidence from the murder for hire claim was collected by two agents who are now both sitting in Federal prison as well lol. It would have been my guess that the US Attorney would have more than gone ahead with those charges had they not had to have two of their very own imprisoned agents in orange jumpsuits take the stand and give testimony -- there is way too much risk the defense and media would have had a field day with those agents and put in doubt not just the murder for hire but possibly the entire case against Ross.

Sounds like someone who traded and lost -- usually that is how it happens because people have a hard time shouldering the loss upon their fragile egos -- so rather than admit you lack the skills to trade successfully you will come out saying saying it isnt possible and that TA is bullshit that way you dont have to accept losing in trading.

Here is the youtube list of all 33 exchange hangouts we have done with nearly every major exchange including : OKCoin, Huobi, Bitmex, Bitfinex, GDAX, Gemini, Bittrex, Kraken, Coinfloor, BTCC and countless other's in the crypto trading space dating back to middle of 2014:

yes they are -- but again that is not what I was arguing even -- and you seem to not understand that you can't market sell 16k of BTC anywhere on any exchange, the exchange limits won't let you do such a thing.
@_date: 2018-04-10 04:15:47
This should be the top voted post -- anytime someone includes the phrase 
"TA is useless it can't predict the price of BTC" means they fundamentally lack the concept of what TA actually is.
It is an **analysis** -- ie it is like discussing symptoms in a patient and drawing some inferences of what could be the cause and methods of action going forword to identify and treat such patient. TA is no different.
Secondly just because you can't apply TA and be profitable doesn't mean it is debunked as useless -- 99.998% of basketball players will never make 1 cent by playing basketball -- probably equally the amount of people that could successfully perform brain surgery but that doesn't mean it is bogus. The problem with trading is people think it is "easy"-- some guy looking at charts on his computer clicking around how hard can that be -- well truth is to become a consistently profitable trader you need 1000s of hours of practice likely over the course of years -- too many people get lulled into to believing it is easy.

You mean like when we were at $30 and no one took crypto seriously ? or even like when crypto was at $100 and no on took it seriously ? lol -- every major fortune 500 company is exploring and looking into what they can (if possible) do to get a slice of the blockchain tech pie. I think it is taken pretty seriously these days.


There is no way a competent individual with experience in the markets could say such a thing -- 1) if that was true then why is Tim Sykes a multi-millionaire -- a guy that made all his money shorting scam pump and dump stocks in the listed market and he has taught his students to do the same as we sit here today -- so clearly the regulators are failing if someone can make millions shorting fraud pump and dump companies under their watch
2) Read Michael Lewis's Flash Boys and the work of Eric Hunsader at Nanex  and get back to me if you still feel that way


What has and will continue to be the trend is there will be two markets -- the onshore regulated markets for the funds and Wall Street boys and the offshore markets that actually have innovation, lower fees, and better products at the trade off of not having a legal avenue of recourse. Both markets have and will continue to co-exist

did you actually read my comment -- it is not FUD nor is it likely to effect the overall markets much and this has been what has happened numerous times in the past -- exchange gets notice from US regulators then takes actions in banning/prohibiting US users from using their platform. That is what has happened each and every single time.
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:22:06
 &gt;i'm saying that other think like that
you can't control what other people are going to think -- running around yelling that it is all just "FUD" offers nothing productive to the discussion either.


because I have tried it before -- and I talk to exchanges owners quite regularly about market dynamics and exchange mechanics


yes that is why some exchanges have opened an OTC desk lol
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:56:21


this isn't fear mongering -- people are trying to interpret this new piece of information real time -- even if that comes at the price of uncertainty it is a discovery process. That is why younger generations prefer seeing the opinions of 100s or 1000s of people on twitter and different accounts of an event rather than 1 MSM package news program.


even if it is done on OTC it still has spillover effect into the exchange markets as well -- in fact many of the OTC brokers source liquidity off the exchanges in their deals so it is quite naive to think it is just some partitioned unrelated market.

the market and subsequent price action is just a manifestation of human psychology -- people get all worked up how the market sentiment changes so quickly but it is still the most efficient way to price things unless you think the government/socialism does a better job.

There is no way you can market sell a 16k position anywhere on any exchange. You really are talking from a point of very little understanding if you think such things. Most exchanges have limits of 1k or even less and if you try and market sell immediately another 1k you will error/time out. One could easily just use any of the TWAP or Iceberg tools to sell small amounts over a period of time if they choose to do so.
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:45:36
Because the market is always seeking out information regardless -- just because the information does not appear to be positive does not immediately mean it is "FUD" because you want it to be and hurts your investment. It is up to people and the collective market to interpret to what degree of pricing effect this has on the overall market. Generally as things become more and more well known they have lesser and lesser of an effect on the overall market (ie China ban bitcoin for 787th time)-- not to mention the market is most fragile when it is a parabolic advance like we say in December. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:55:07
Pretty sure we are well past those all those sayings -- we were in the "then they fight you phase" all the way back in 2013 when FinCEN and the Secret Service were holding hearings with Congress about Bitcoin. If they were going to act to "ban" Bitcoin they would have had to then because now you have US Marshals that have auctioned off millions of dollars of BTC in 2014 and 2015 from the Silk Road/DPR as well as the 100s of US VC firms that have gotten involved in crypto related companies and projects. Do you think Andreessen Horowitz (Coinbase VC) the largest VC firm on planet earth is just going to let some crusty dinosaurs in Congress kill their cash cows ? Not a chance in hell. They have the lawyers and the lobbying power to fight any congress person that is trying to do such things and more so will fund competitors to get these kind of people out of office.   
We have already "won" ... the question is what extent do we "win" ? That is still TBD
