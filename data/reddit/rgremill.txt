Hi, u/PAdogooder is selling this. Please go through his posts and you should find a sales page on one of them.

The Bitcoin price on the watch reminds me of this old Poster -

Silver is the money of the future, didn't you see Looper?
Of course... according to Almost Human Bitcoin is the winner...
I bet on both.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:39:49
In the show the guy steals $427K worth of Bitcoin. I like to think that it was only ONE Bitcoin. :-)
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:35:52
Awesome. Next step... 1 in a million!
@_date: 2014-02-13 12:37:58
Nice. Which gig was it?
@_date: 2014-10-12 15:40:55
Why does this remind me of net neutrality? 
@_date: 2014-12-25 17:10:53
Because it is a barbarous relic like gold???
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:39:52
I would love to see what this writer was saying about the Web in 1995.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:50:46
Bitcoin reminds me of Berskshire Class A shares which never split. One day only big institutions will be able to trade them. Currently $263,000 -

Only 20,999,999 people can be as BTC rich as you. :-)

What is he holding up in this video? What did he cash out for?

"That's no moon!"
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:52:43
Will this cover Trezor?

There's a link on the Send page to "use max"? Did you use that?

Maybe needs a lightning bolt underneath the car?
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:14:28
Do they have less volume with all of the bitcoins withdrawn? Are they losing customers because of the non-support? Glad they are doing this .
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:13:05
We are somewhere around 94 or 95. We just saw Coinbase get a $1 billion valuation but we haven't seen a single traditional IPO for a crypto startup. Once we see IPO's and the financial news spending 24/7 on these IPO's, then we will be somewhere around 98 or 99.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:10:59
They made an entire movie about finding lost E.T. Atari 2600 Cartridges. :-)
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:54:34
With the DIP starting / threatening today, I am thinking he might be making the wisest moves...

I want it.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:19:37
I'm still predicting PayPal will buy Coinbase or some other exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:20:32
Watched it last night. Good show. Here are a couple of observations. It is funny how the regulators set up all of these hurdles then become consultants for companies who need to get through the mess they created. Ethereum guy is in the background in many scenes, like some type of "mole". :-) And you know Bitcoin means money when Blythe Masters sets up an office to bank on it.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:32:32
It doesn't have to be Coinbase. They could go after some other exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:50:40
$PYPL is up today because of this post. :-)

It should land on its feet if thrown. :-)

Ordered one. Thanks for the awesome post!
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:14:18
The Bitcoin Cash price has been slowly sinking. It is now below $600. The transaction amounts are slowly declining also. One day soon it could have major swings downward. It should have been called Bitcoin Classic since its price will likely end up like Ethereum Classic.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:11:15
You are dividing by 80 billion people?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:24:11

Sadly yes. I think I hit it right at the low watermark. :-(
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:55:03
I still love this song. The words are perfect.
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:22:24
Instant buy doesn't mean instant get.

We designed a Bitcoin Moon Buggy model.
This model uses the Bitcoin coins from the original Bitcoin Roller Coaster Guy model.

Maybe we should update it to include weapons? :-)
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:37:07
They might need you to debug some code for them first.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:28:05
Thank you! Our last 2 models had 94% upvotes. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:41:15
He uses Bitcoin to attempt to gather support for Gold. So there's one use right there.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:56:35
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:42:34
They said they were monitoring the situation... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:34:19
Bitcoin gets the attention because of the high prices. The high prices would be good for big players and stability. (See $BRK.A stock)
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:57:19
Awesome idea. I think you should put the bottom two boxes to the right side stacked so they can be seen easily on a laptop screen. Thanks!

I think this guy is awesome.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:42:25
That could have been it. But the percentage of upvotes is nothing like previous models.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:01:37
I don't know. Maybe Reddit needs to add captcha to votes???
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:45:45
It is a Bitcoin roller coaster that changes direction based on the price movements.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:04:08
Consider mine Phase 1 and yours Phase 2. :-)
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:29:02
Sorry I don't have that version.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:38:11
I uploaded the files to Thingiverse. I will post the link later today.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:41:17
I don't know what that means. But the arms have to be thick in order to be 3D printable.

I had higher hopes for Overstock. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:51:56
There will always be people who want to kill innovation. I'm not sure if you were around when the web first took off, but we are seeing the same thing with Cryptos.

I had this idea of converting the Bitcoin Roller Coaster guy into a 3D printed desk toy. So I posted an Upwork job and hired a modeler to create the files for me. You can find the files on Thingiverse here -

It is 3D printed. The files are on Thingiverse.

Talked to my Dad last night. He says, I heard the price of Bitcoin went down. Then he also asks: but what can you buy with it? I told him about the Texas Real Estate transaction, just this past week.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:38:40
Yes, once it is done. It uses python.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:33:57
I have a Makerbot and printed this. The files are on Thingiverse if you have a friend with a 3D printer.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:38:19
I like this idea. Nice.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:27:10
Think of this as buying eBay stock to get PayPal dividends. Or buying Amazon stock to get AWS dividends. Etc

This is the same plot from The Social Network. Zuck is supposedly working on a project for the Twins (NYA), but secretly working on his own similar project.

You know the phrase: First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. Jamie Dimon is the they. This tells us Bitcoin is at the fighting stage and on the verge of winning. That's why it is important to people.

Nah, that sounds like a lot of work. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:46:16
Bitcoin is like the digital dollar you use every day, except it can't be inflated away by some government.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:27:51
This is a prototype. It will be switched to the other direction.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:49:16
So you think we need to add a mechanical backup system? :-)
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:06:59
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:34:35
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:37:53
Yes that will be fixed. But it is the direction to match the down cartoon images.
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:12:37
We posted a high def image just for you. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:36:51
The down image is always shown that way btw but we are going to flip it.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:43:56
I agree. Most transactions will be done off chain or via alts. Then moved to BTC for long term holding.
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:05:06
Yes, it was printed on a Makerbot.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:08:26
I like the idea. I don't know if I could pull it off though.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:59:23
Coinbase still throws in this line: If the Segwit2x change is accepted by most users, we may choose to rename these blockchains at a later date.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:02:06
I just posted an image of our really crude prototype. We aren't selling these things we just wanted to make it a reality. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:15:28
It only works when the bitcoin market is open :-)
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:56:48

Bitcoin guy always smiles. There's nothing to be sad about. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:44:38
They did such a great job. The movement "feels" like a roller coaster!
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:14:32
Yes, we will release the code once we get in a better state. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:42:40
I wonder if they had a plan for Segwit2X guy offering his own Alt coin? :-)
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:46:33
Yes we uploaded the files here - 
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:11:20
I used multiple colors for the specific pieces. The only painting is for the eyes.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:05:37

Sorry, we will not be selling these, but maybe you can find someone to make one for you.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:32:44
There's a switch on the back so you can change it to Litecoin. :-)

We plan on writing something up after we finalize the thing. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:34:54
This idea didn't even cross my mind but multiple people had it today. It is a very good idea.

@_date: 2017-10-17 23:56:01
You read the article right?
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:56:07
Yes. The eyes were painted black.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:29:14
Yes it is. We are working on the conversion to arduino soon.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:41:18
It cost me $1.5 to send $10 at Coinbase. :-(

@_date: 2017-10-24 11:25:20
You must hate Bitcoin then. Because it deflates every time someone loses their keys.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:38:04
In an hour. It calls an API every 5 minutes. a 1% change would cause a 90 degree angle.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:29:12
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:00:56
When it moves to the arduino the control/network will be on the host computer. For now the raspberry pi does everything.
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:45:53
We could all stand for the Bitcoin anthem. Just joking. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:38:44
Yeah that would be awesome. I doubt we can pull that off though.
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:25:23
Yeah, we need to make one of those. Good idea.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:39:32

If you ever see the coaster cartoon going down it is facing this way, but we plan on flipping it.

Sorry we are not selling this version. There's another thread where you can buy one.
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:37:23
Good idea. We should run a full node on it also. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:06:22
No, because the dip is a buying situation which makes him twice as happy!!!
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:57:40
That's a good question. I thought it was 25% but I could be remembering incorrectly.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:27:55
You mean this one? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:50:00

This morning the Drudge headline said "Bitcoin Hacked" because he copied the article title from CNBC. I'm sure a bunch of people contacted him saying it was not true. Now the title reads - "Top Bitcoin Site Hacked: Price Stumbles After Buying Frenzy..." which is not technically correct, but better...

Thanks for your replies!
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:09:11
Even if the transactions are being ignored wouldn't this still impact the system with processing?
Also, what if the government, with unlimited "money" did this and added a transaction fee to every one?
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:01:17
You can do a search on his page. I've never seen him mention them before today. I have literally been bugging him about it for weeks.

What's to stop someone from creating a thousand wallets then simply shifting one Satoshi from account to account every second to flood the market with transactions?
Also, how could you use Bitcoin with vending machines if the transactions are not instant?
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:35:52

Waiting for someone to create a Krugman cyrpto currency. (Sadly the Fiat version has been inflated by the media with their over printing.)
