Yep. Until her landlord gets the first electricity bill and it's more than she pays in rent. At that point the landlord will do anything and everything possible to evict her and recoup any losses.
There is no such thing as free electricity. Someone must pay for it. If it isn't your sister, it's the landlord. Can you imagine any scenario where a landlord would pay for a tenant to earn Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-30 07:00:05
You're not really understanding me. She will be evicted. Even if the contract says "free electricity, forever, with no usage limits, because I'm either an idiot or a super nice guy", the landlord will not support her wealth-creation endeavour financially. She will be evicted one way or another, either in a nice or a nasty way. If you want to be litigious because "contract" then you will spend a massive amount on lawyers for no gain then be known in the area as the tenant who gets litigious.
Rental income - outgoings = profit. As soon as profit heads below zero, the business is not sustainable and the landlord will do absolutely anything to save it (or declare bankruptcy).
If you were in this magical fantasy apartment where electricity was really and truly permanently free (maybe your landlord has a volcano or a hydro plant next door) then you'd make much more money by selling the electricity on to several of your neighbours.
Or let's try another scenario- where she's in an apartment block where everyone has "free" electricity but she's the only miner. Maybe the landlord doesn't notice when one in thirty apartments starts to burn twenty times as much juice, but the rent will rise for everyone who will now be jointly subsidising her mining operation. Does this feel ethical to you, or does it feel like theft? Or worse- she mentions this magic money box to other tenants and pretty soon everyone is mining. The landlord gets the electricity bill and has to evict everyone.
Free electricity does not exist. Even where solar or volcanic or hydro "free" energy exists there are infrastructure or operating costs involved in generating electricity and moving it around a grid. So if you are paying nothing for your electricity then somebody else is picking up your tab.

I found two things very weird in this interview excerpt.
1. At the end he complains about not being able to attend conferences "anonymously" any more. So why did he ever claim to be Satoshi? That outcome was an obvious consequence of his own actions, so why rant at an interviewer about it? For an intelligent guy, a measured guy, it seems very odd to be shouting at clouds like this.
2. His heated comment "it's my fucking money". I cannot believe that someone who invented such an elegant mathematical construct as Bitcoin would ever make that statement. I think he'd shout "they're my fucking coins". It's a small but important distinction that I believe Satoshi would make.

Seriously, then the best advice I can give is “get out of cryptocurrency because you will make a mistake and possibly lose all your coins at some point”. Choose a financial product with a manager instead- that’s why such things exist.

Oh I don’t hate GreenAddress, but I think this is a serious problem with their offering which everyone should be aware of- if there’s a fork and NewBitcoin heads to the moon, there is **no way at all** to access your NewBitcoin from your 2of2 wallet without GreenAddress implementing new code, which they are perfectly within their rights to not do. Despite having half a hand on your valuable NewBitcoin, you are powerless to control it.
As far as I know they relented and coded up BCH support but I stopped using and advising people to use GreenAddress about that time (for this very reason) so I don’t know whether they supported bitcoin gold etc.

I'd be interested in commentary from Purse on this. Given that their core product is managing the transaction, it seems fair to say that in this case Purse **core functionality** was broken, and resulted in one party not receiving what they were owed.

The private keys and bitcoin addresses that controlled your BTC at the block of the split also control the BCH created at the block of the split. You just need to construct a transaction using the (presumably one) private key to move your BCH. Probably easiest to import that private key to a BCH wallet.

Thanks for all this effort, but I feel you’ve missed vital information which should directly inform a user’s choice.
Firstly, whether each wallet is open source and so whether it requires a user to trust the company. These companies owe us nothing and could easily be storing our private keys for a future coin grab and subsequent disappearance.
Secondly, GreenWallet needs a health warning. You do not fully own your funds in a 2of2 GreenWallet in the event of a fork. To put it another way, if you own a 2of2 wallet, and a fork occurs, you will **never** be able to access your free coins without GreenAddress effecting some work. The solution is to only use a 2of3 GreenWallet. Then when a fork occurs you can move your new, free coins without GreenAddress’ help.

.... but set up a 2of3 wallet and use that so you control your own keys in the event of a fork. People are still trying to rescue their BCH from GreenWallet 2of2 wallets over on their sub.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:45:15
Not quite.
If you had a GreenWallet 2of3 wallet, you owned two of the three keys. This means you could sign transactions on the BCH blockchain from the unspent outputs you control.
If you had a GreenWallet 2of2 wallet, you had your key and an nlocktime-guarded pre-signed transaction *on the BTC blockchain*. Without GreenAddress co-signing a transaction on the **BCH** blockchain, you cannot, ever, move your BCH.
The GreenWallet folks stonewalled for a while and then relented and [added an API call]( which allows users to have their transactions co-signed on an alternative blockchain, but only BCH is supported.
This is how the BCH recovery tool recovers BCH from 2of2 GreenWallet wallets. To do so is a very technical process and requires an (expired?) nlocktime.zip containing the addresses you have BCH on.

Probably. But very few people get truly free electricity. If it's a parent's then they start noticing really fast; if it's a college's then they just put up the prices next term, at which point you're basically stealing money from everyone who is subsidising you by not consuming vast amounts of "free" electricity.
Edit: sorry I also forgot to mention the risks. What happens if the Bitcoin price halves? Or drops to $100? You spent more than that on a piece of junk which is just a room warmer.

You mean "I think, based on evidence I just made up, it's because of you that there are so few full nodes.", I think. By the way I've run two full nodes for about two years. How many node-years are you up to?
You are conflating usability with bells and whistles. You're demonstrating that you know nothing about software development and aren't willing to listen to someone who does.
I absolutely agree that usability for lots of open source applications sucks. The ebook management software Calibre is the best example of this that I can think of. The problem is that GUI applications take an order of magnitude more effort than a service without some pretty shit. As I said in my previous response, and I'll repeat it, please spend that money on making the service leaner, faster, more stable, and leave the pretty shit to someone else who cares about it enough to spend a bunch of time writing it. We (the people that run nodes) don't want it or care about it.
I never said anything about what you can or can't or should or shouldn't do. If someone wants to spend a million man-hours making something which renders your node's load average in beautiful shades of maroon then good luck to them. I personally think their effort would be more beneficially expended making the software (as I said) leaner, faster and more stable.

What does your Trezor transaction history say? Can you see the funds arrive? Did they leave again?
My guesses:
- You have passphrases enabled and you're not using the correct passphrase for the HD wallet containing the funds. A blank passphrase is possible.
- You've used a compromised machine to send the funds or create the receive address.
- You've found a new bug in MyTrezor.
The next step for me would be to identify my receive addresses and make sure I sent my funds to one of those receive addresses, then see what happened to the Bitcoin from there.
I hope it turns out alright for you.

However, I don't believe people ever read terms and conditions when they install software, so committing them to spending their money in those terms and conditions is not reasonable for the average user.
The software should additionally verify when first run "would you agree to paying the devs $dollaramount every $numberoftransactions to fund the continued improvement of this software? You can opt out any time in the future".
Then, absolutely no problem at all.
TLDR Fine concept, but implemented for engineers, not for humans.

Any news on when a non-instantly-crashing Coinbase app might be released? I've not been able to launch the app since the beginning of November. I can see from the reviews that this is the case for lots of people, and also that it was acknowledged by Coinbase on their forums. Isn't this more urgent than a small UI glitch?
Allowing a broken release to remain so for nearly five weeks doesn't help me believe in you guys, which is a shame.

You didn't improve security whatsoever. You made things worse.
- You made your customers have unnecessarily complex and unmemorable passwords that they have to write down or store in their phones.
- You added friction to your site so people just don't bother signing in when they can't remember what unique and obscure password you forced them to have.
- You displayed ignorance of simple mathematical principals and of human behaviour.
I suggest you google "correct battery horse staple" and see what you [find](

Really super off topic, so this is my only comment on this, but:
Real scientific data shows that fat/cholesterol are not the bad guys (for example, your body creates 2/3 of its cholesterol internally) and in general we've been manipulated for decades by govt and big food companies. Google for Weston a price whose website contains many articles written by independently-funded (I.e. Not big food) studies which confirm this. As another example, there has never been any unbiased scientific proof that eating basically as many eggs and as much butter as you like is bad for you. Further fun reading, Google "Ancel keys" and "lipid hypothesis" to see how modern nutrition advice has been basically manipulated since the 50s onwards.
It all sounds a bit tinfoil hatted, but I've been trying for a couple of years and failing to prove I haven't been lied to about nutrition my whole life. Jennifer McLagan's excellent book "Fat" is what started me off.

The problem with them is that it seems their website is written by a 12 year old script kiddy!
I enter my postcode and am told that it's unacceptable because it doesn't contain a space. When I try to contact their customer support to tell them and ask why this is so poor, I cannot submit my query without providing a phone number. I cannot enter a phone number of 0 but it will accept the number 9999999999. These small but telling inconsistencies of user experience really erode any confidence I have in their ability to provide me with a decent service.
If they can't sensibly parse a postcode, goodness knows how robust their Bitcoin handling code is.

This response confuses me. The starting premise for their taking donations at all is "more money helps us achieve our goals"; they complain here that Bitcoin is untraceable, but then also that their campaigns may be prejudiced if they receive donations from certain sources (by definition therefore, traceable).
If receiving ANY money furthers their goals, and this money is - by their own definition - untraceable, then in what way might their campaigns be compromised?
What's the worst case scenario? Giant world-wrecking organisation bankrolls Greenpeace for a year then makes a proof of ownership transaction and tells the world? Or maybe GWWO don't tell the world and instead blackmail GP with the threat of removing this funding next year? This just mean GP need to be conservative about volatility of donations and to keep a decent buffer of money in reserve. As a charity they should be managing these risks anyway, wherever their funding comes from.
Much confuse.

It doesn't matter what language you code in. All code has bugs in, really. No amount of type safety or garbage collection will save you. What can help is a solid process with good QA. Make sure you understand the quality of and risks inherent in what you release. This can be a lot cheaper than you expect. Be bold enough to not release something when you're not confident in it.

The numbers in the screen grab add up. After the 1BTC you didn't have 91BTC to spend, but you sent 91BTC anyway. Presumably mytrezor doesn't disallow this because the first transaction 1BTC is not "spent" as such because it hasn't been confirmed.
I don't know what hep pens when you try to spend the same bitcoins twice, thought I'm guessing that one of the transactions will be rejected. Best ask the trezor people...

Firstly, you neglected to quote an important point of my reply, which is "and the process". QA can be very cheap and find lots of defects. Targeted QA for security even more so. (It can also be very expensive!)
Secondly, a C variable can take any value- not a well-defined one. A developer can choose to ignore a type warning, and they often do. Yes, I realise I'm arguing that C is unsafe but this bears out my point that any language can be safe or unsafe - it's what you do with it that counts.

What I am not is an economist- I'm an engineer.
The gist of Mike's comments were "Bitcoin is broken, I'm out". From the get-go this is an ambiguous and unquantifiable attitude, as there are no stated goals to the project. One could argue that as it is today, Bitcoin is hugely successful. But Mike is obviously making a forward-looking assessment.
In my opinion Mike threw a wobbler and news agencies around the world saw a golden opportunity to stick the boot in, which subsequently rattled a lot of confidence. Literally nothing changed though between the day before his article, and the day after. Bitcoin is still the same and facing the same challenges, largely political. At the engineering end, someone will always be the core developers- maybe the current group of people or maybe a different group. It doesn't matter. Politically, the market will choose whichever works best. From an engineering perspective, engineering problems get solved. Bitcoin won't go away.

I don't understand this. Apple is a company. Had they failed, they'd be asset stripped and the stock price would go to zero. Bitcoin isn't a company - there's no business to fail, so the likelihood of the tradeable value of Bitcoin heading to zero is surely much smaller?

My experience of managing teams of engineers is that they rarely use all their holidays each year. Some never take any holiday and I've had to order them to take time off. The difference between n-days-off and this is negligible in practise. I suspect as many candidates would see this as a silly buzzword gambit as would see it as cool, so no impact there either.

Your trezor has potentially millions of receive addresses. If you asked for the next receive address and inspected that using blockchain.info then it will have a zero balance because... you didn't send any money to it yet. You need to check the balances of all the addresses in use on your trezor.

You want an HD wallet app to check the billions of addresses it can generate for funds? That may take a while and use a lot of bandwidth! In a real world scenario you use consecutive addresses as receive addresses and wallets will check until they find a few consecutive zero balances.
TLDR guy sent funds to a random HD wallet address he owned and (unreasonably) expected his wallet app to find it.
Also, I suggest you start again. Revealing your xpub has revealed all the addresses you might use in the future, meaning a fairly fundamental loss of privacy. This is why so many block explorers don't support it- because normally people don't want to send their xpubs across the public internet.

Bitcoin is backed by the amazing functionality and facility it affords and by solid maths. The real world use cases Bitcoin enables are like magic.
For example, I can put real spendable money in the piece-of-paper wallet in your pocket from halfway across the planet instantly by telling the blockchain (and therefore the whole world) that it's there. That functionality alone is a pretty amazing asset.

Ok, you've cherry-picked micropayments. Today it is economically feasible for me to send 0.5USD in Bitcoin to someone in Nepal to translate some text for me. It is not economically feasible to do that using PayPal or a bank. Let's try capital controls. It is economically feasible for my friend who lives and works in China to send his pay using Bitcoin to his wife in Spain. Using Chinese currency and banks it is not. I know a kid whose parents treat him like shit who saves money as Bitcoin because he's not allowed a bank account.


If I experience something first hand or someone I trust relates it to me, it is fact, anecdotal or not. You have not countered my factual examples with any facts yet.


You don't need a computer. A smartphone and 10EUR ledger wallet or, with more effort, a smartphone and paper wallet are all you need. If you can't print, then for your cold storage you could literally at its most basic repeatedly toss a coin and create your own cold storage wallet longhand if that's all that's available to you.


The use case I referred to is that of feature phones (basically phones which don't run apps) being involved at all. Pretty much everywhere seems to have smartphones now, which renders the least-technologically advanced scenario obsolete. So you're agreeing with me here. Thanks.
Your arguments still seem to boil down to you not wanting to like Bitcoin. That's fine, but it seems strange that to do that you have to disagree that the use cases I've cited do exist and are a very positive thing for society. I suppose if that's what you enjoy then so be it. Let's make it easier and just say I made it all up then?

Me too, but I'm genuinely mystified by their development process which seems to require secrecy. You create maturity in a software product by giving it as much attention as possible at all stages of development. They choose not to.

It's like they know the best practice and are deliberately ignoring it for some nefarious reason.

You seem to rely on wild conjecture to buoy your argument. Bitcoin provides "almost none" of these things? They're all examples I've either directly experienced or have seen related on various forums. Telling me they didn't happen or don't exist does not endear me to your opinion.
A computer or the Internet is not required to receive payments, but of course you knew that. As for sending money, the simplest and cheapest smartphones are capable enough for this, and who knows- someone may set up a SMS gateway that enables it on feature phones, though I doubt there is the demand. The whole world is full of "developing nations" of people who are smart and ingenious but who are unable to access traditional banking services.
Global micropayments are happening now. Musicians, artists, writers, can all accept tips for their work from anywhere globally. So in answer to how much value are they, I'd answer, they solve a problem that was once impractical or impossible, so they are hugely valuable.
Given that you're saying capital controls are good, I'm going to bow out of this discussion as I don't think there's much good to come from it. I seem to be providing all the facts and you're just lazily playing devil's advocate.

It can function as that, yes, but not very well. Cash is fast and Bitcoin is not. Some changes are being made to address (but not cure) that.

It's folly to use terms like "several orders of magnitude" when discussing such an intangible as quality. One developer, or one release manager, or one product-owner could have spotted and managed this problem.
The biggest failure here is the motivation (or maybe experience?) of someone who would ever try to commit something like this to a core codebase. If you don't understand the risks, don't commit code to the product. Get help. More eyes and more visibility. Knowing what you don't know is important in a developer.

I should clarify. Apologies - I was interrupted as I was typing and sent rather than deleted.
There's no technical reason for any service downtime. Distributed computing makes one point of failure a worry of the past. Whatever reason large stock markets have for their downtime, there's no technical justification for it.
I worked for a crappy startup for a while. Our product was a search engine and we had close to 100% uptime/service availability. We had no failure or fuckup downtime. We had a fully redundant identical rig to our main server and for new releases staged and tested on that and then a/b switched it in. If any major problems were found within the next week or two we a/b switched back to the old server and release. This is at a crappy startup - and we had no responsibility at all for hundreds of millions of dollars of other people's cash.
So my point is that technical risk can be managed to be not a consideration. If Bitfinex are claiming technical problems then they're not applying basic risk management techniques or they're making it up to cover up something else.

You could use a coinbase multisig vault and control the majority of the keys. The issue is controlling enough keys to sign a transaction.
A lot of people on this sub have a knee-jerk reaction to the word "coinbase" and many don't realise there is an option to control your own keys and thus control your coins without Coinbase's involvement.
Note: In such a vault, as I understand it, Coinbase control both their key and another key *encrypted with your password*. If they were hacked it might be possible for an attacker to use both of these to move your coins. It's not clear to me whether coinbase multisig vault coins are insured in the same way as coinbase coins.

My expectation was not managed at all, and that's part of the problem.
You are suggesting that it was inevitable that there would be hostility between the BCH and the BTC community. Why? They can peacefully coexist like professionals, despite having differing goals and opinions.
Blockstream could be using this exact opportunity to show its belief and confidence in BTC by promoting and allowing access to BCH in GreenWallet.

I think I understand where you're coming from now; and I still think you dealt with this case unreasonably. I just can't dismiss that you led someone to believe that they won and then refused to pay out on a technicality. I accept that you used your rules to protect your business however.
Thanks for spending the time explaining. I am more sympathetic to your situation as a result and maybe other readers of this might be.

I can't believe what I'm reading. It almost sounds like you are proud of the fact that you allowed yourself to lock up people's money without telling them. 
Here is a hint as to this customer's priority:
Company acquired by another company we've never heard of: LOW PRIORITY
If I do not take action we lose some free money: HIGH PRIORITY. 
Can you really not see which of these is more important to an end user?
I don't think it's unprofessional to be the very best Bitcoin wallet you can be. I think it's unprofessional to manage expectations badly and to cause active on-side loyal customers to lose money they own.
As I've said in another thread, this is your opportunity to win loyalty, and you seem dead set on losing it.

I'll upvote you for your clearly presented argument but I don't agree.
I have advised people to use coinbase in the scenario where they are not capable of or happy with the responsibility of being their own bank; but coinbase has dealt with BCH very poorly. The net result is that they would own money that their customers should have owned, and I can't support that at all.
I've helped everyone I know onto hardware wallets recently because of Coinbase's arrogance over the hard fork.
I understand your need for "stability, safety and security" but there was nothing stopping Coinbase having a gigantic "BTC/BCH" switch in the corner of their user interface which absolutely switched easily and understandably between the two.
Instead they chose to profit from the innocent.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:31:11
Not really. They create a pre-signed transaction for their part of the 2of2 which has a minimum height where it can be used. So GA users have half a 2of2 BTC block chain transaction, which is, I believe, useless to move BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:39:01
This is correct. To use their wallet you **must** trust Coinomi. You must trust that they're not secretly stashing away your private keys so they can unexpectedly empty your wallets and disappear. That's not a trust I'm willing to afford.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:25:13
So the bitcoin you sent is now at the address you specified and for which you control the private key? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:45:51
Agree re the user experience of Bitcoin. However, a note re GreenAddress:
GreenAddress are purposely refusing to co-sign 2of2 transactions on the BCH blockchain, effectively placing the BCH owned by anyone who had BTC stored using their service in limbo forever. They claim they emailed everyone before the hard fork to inform them. I know three GreenAddress wallets with verified emails which did NOT receive such emails. They are openly hostile to anyone attempting to unlock the funds that GreenAddress are constructively preventing them from accessing.
For this reason I have gone from a very happy GreenAddress customer to someone who will not ever recommend any of their products ever again.
Before the fork, I contacted everyone I knew who had BTC as a result of talking to me about it. I advised them all what precautions to take and helped them move their BTC such that they controlled their own keys and would have access to their altcoin when the fork occurred. Imagine how stupid I felt when the wallet I had advised my own girlfriend to use didn't allow even a one-time sweep of BCH.
I am completely on the fence regarding BTC and BCH. I think there's a place for both, and I support and own both. A supposedly professional company behaving the way GreenAddress has is tough to ignore however. I hope they either come to their senses or cease to exist- their behaviour has been utterly unprofessional.

Reasons to **not** buy bitcoin
Off the top of my head....
- You cannot afford to lose that capital, if bitcoin goes to zero
- Other cryptos may satisfy major use-cases that bitcoin does not and undermine bitcoin's facility
- You don't deal well with high-volatility investments
- You don't like talking about bitcoin and won't like being "that bitcoin guy/gal"
- You can't stand conflicting opinions
- You are unwilling to invest the time to understand the practicality and risk associated with being your own bank
- You are unhappy with the responsibility of being your own bank, particularly if large amounts of money become involved
- You are unhappy with the risk of using an online bitcoin bank like coinbase
- You are uncomfortable dealing with the Bitcoin user experience (dealing with long strings of letters and numbers) as it stands
- You don't want to support a system which, whilst enabling a great deal of "good", also enables the same "bad"
- You don't want to see government/bank/capitalist controls over fiat currency undermined

That's a superb list. Thanks for curating it!
I don't have an answer right now, but it does seem to have a blind spot with respect to BTC vs BCH. If I were a beginner looking to answer the question of what the difference between the two is (which I'm guessing is probably a common problem at the moment) I can't immediately find an answer. I'm not suggesting this becomes "an amazing collection of high quality Bitcoin *and Bitcoin Cash* resources" but that the distinction should be made in both a BTC explainer and a BCH explainer.

I can provide the email addresses to you if you wish to work out why these three account holders expectation was not managed?
One of those is mine, and I thought I was safe in your hands. It seems I was not.
Maybe this is the interface where I should have been more technical and you should have been more helpful, but that's not my problem- it's yours. I've gone from a perfectly happy customer to one who will never recommend your product again because you are in possession of money that's mine.

On **ALL** your accounts. This can't be emphasised enough. If, for example, your email is weak, an attacker will exploit it to reset passwords and get access to more stuff. I've been hacked once only and the attacker got into my DNS registrar (no 2FA) and installed a blanket email redirect so all email for a domain was going to the attacker. In this case my actual email had strong passwords but my domain registrar account didn't, resulting in the attacker getting my emails.

Simple solution: Buy him $10 bitcoin. Put it on a paper wallet. Give it to him, stress that he shouldn’t reveal the private key and to keep it safe, but to forget about it.

1d2 * 1d3 outcomes. 1, 2, 3, &amp; 2, 4, 6.
In the second case, 2 is twice as likely as anything else and 5 isn't possible. 
So if I knew this was your method, I wouldn't need to check for anything with a 5 in it.

This is what happens when you trust valuables to closed-source software. Small companies simply don’t have the test resources to simulate millions of users and thousands of hackers.
I remember when they stopped publishing updates to their source code (but still claimed to be “open source” on their web site), several people challenged them publicly only to be met by a petulant and aggressive CEO whose responses were, in tone, exactly like the statement they’ve issued- full of red herrings, attempts to shift the blame, and not really addressing the underlying problem. If I remember correctly they claimed their code was still open source because it could be made available for review to a vetted (by them) individual. I wonder whether that actually happened?
Giving the master keys to your wealth to google is a hell of a bug though. If a software company can ship a clanger like this, I wonder what else their quality assurance process can let through?
Even if they used a graphical toolkit that has google spellcheck enabled by default, a conscientious developer would be all over making sure that option was turned off, being absolutely aware that third party code was involved, and flagging it up for QA to specifically check, what with it being pretty much the worst thing that could go wrong. Having a developer that didn’t think about that, and a process that didn’t catch it, is an incredible failure for a company whose product is keeping customer’s money secure.

Exactly. Someone forks the code, makes a new implementation, plays the political game to try to get it popular, succeeds, then their implementation is the new Bitcoin.

It's helping by mentioning the names of the services that I use to move money between countries. I also suggested that peer to peer exchanges were a better option than Bitcoin at this time. Does that answer your question?
Before I hit "post" I actually thought "is this post helpful?" and decided that actually, it did contain useful information.
Your suggestion that the man should use a bank is probably one of the more expensive ways of achieving his goal, so I would never give that advice. It's bad advice. At the very least a forex specialist is much cheaper than a bank.

You're focusing too much on one codebase. The code is open, so you, me, and in fact everybody on the planet has commit access. The trick is to convince everybody to use your particular flavour of the code. If I copied the code and made some changes that everyone thought were fantastic, and the current Bitcoin core didn't adopt those changes, then maybe my code would become more popular and then I would be "the one true maintainer" of today's favourite codebase, with er... exactly zero power, because if my next "improvement" pissed off everybody, someone else could fork my code before my change and then *they* would be the "one true maintainer".

QA guy here. I’m astonished that those defects were let out of the door. That’s really poor. Both bugs show that not even one person in the whole organisation even checked the basic BTC/LTC functionality of the code before it was released. Astonishing.
I’m the guy who used to send developers emails about their shitty checkins at 3am saying “did you really mean to do that?”. I would have spotted a random change/typo in a checkin if the checkin comment didn’t explain it adequately. My point being that it doesn’t even need to make it to an actual tester to spot an illogical source code change.
The testnet thing is just shoddy. Pre-release scripts could (and should) be checking “we’re about to release, are we on the right network?” and setting off klaxons if someone messed up.

The current UK govt is the most capitalist and greedy one we've had since Thatcher's in the eighties. They also seem to be the most stupid, as evidenced by their *globally embarrassing* comments about banning encryption.
London is also a major global banking hub. 
I suspect all the talk about FinTech is all marketing to attract money and investment to the UK and as soon as it's realised that Bitcoin etc has the power to fundamentally disrupt traditional banks, the headlines will change to "UK is leading pioneer of FinTech **regulation**", ie if we can't control it (and get rich from it), it isn't going to fly here.

A moment's googling turned up  which seems to be a good summary. It looks like the govt/EU are *still* ping-ponging and things are in a state of flux since it's clearly in their interests to have public wifi available. The original proposal made offering public wifi something of a huge problem, which is when I heard about it (I used to always run a public access point in my house for passers-by. This, among other factors, made me stop).

As a guy who grew up in a thrifty family, (turn the light off if you leave the room, wear an extra sweater if you're cold) Iceland blew my mind. I was there in a harsh January and it was *cold*. We walked up a main road past some residential buildings in something of a freezing cold downpour, and **everyone had their windows open**.
Every nerve in my body was screaming at this deliberate waste of heat energy, until I realised that it's free of consequence environmentally and almost free of charge economically.
What a place. I'm surprised it isn't the world capital of Bitcoin mining.

Not today. I have two internet broadband connections at home and I multi-home over them both. The number of websites which don't work properly with setup is huge. Particularly banking websites seem very sensitive when one packet comes from one IP address and the next from another.
Practically it means I regularly have to turn off one connection just to connect to my bank. Because they don't know about or understand or care about MPTCP or multi-homing this will not get fixed. :(

But ordinary people need to get involved and risk getting burned for it to proliferate. The user experience is really a huge problem as far as I can see.
Also, in my defence, the broader conversation was about Greece's problems and the response Europe was having to them. As the conversation developed I was thinking "Bitcoin fixes that!" and "Bitcoin means *this* doesn't have to happen!" more and more until I had to say something. I wasn't pressing the issue, although it took a couple of very specific use-cases to help her understand the sheer bulldozer power of bitcoin.

I agree. I'm just reading Popper's book about Bitcoin's history, and the amount of work which has gone into the "ecosystem" to date is just incredible.

I don't mind paying a small amount of my cash to support the network in the face of this incredible stuff which has gone before.

I like to peek at his pique from my peak.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:34:51
I'm not convinced that humans are organised enough to make this successful. In my apartment building, everyone has their own wifi which they pay for and use infrequently and spottily. If they were organised enough they could map out which wifi is wasted and share wifi connections to reduce their bills.
The problem here isn't payments- it's organisation and planning.
But suppose this problem is not a problem and we somehow organise ourselves optimally such that the total bandwidth of the building is used perfectly, so the total external data rate is always the same (unlikely I know but let's be fanciful). Since the wifi providers no longer are seeing typical low and spotty usage, they will rate limit or increase their prices to compensate them since, on average, each customer now will use more bandwidth.
Am I missing something magic about this? I know plenty about internetworking and that stuff and just don't see it when people are saying "this is the coolest thing ever". How does this save bandwidth?
Also, see my other post about multi-homing not being practical at the moment. The internet wants you to connect with one connection only right now.
I love Bitcoin and I love networks which means I should think this is a great idea, but I don't. Help!

I tend to agree with you regarding the outward new functionality. I also think the new device is too big and too ugly. :)

I totally understand what you're saying but the problem is that this is not how purse's offering is presented to customers. 
I switch to dumb user mode, load up my wishlist and there! Right there! I can drag the slider all the way to 50%! Well why the hell *wouldn't I*?
This is the disconnect they need to address. Either educate their customers (unlikely) or get rid of the big ol' slidey slider and replace it with something that indicates that the larger savings are for "advanced users" and other such scary words like "risk-aware users".

This guy's business is logjammed for liquidity and support's suggestion is that they send an email? That's a **massive** problem right there. 
I actually sympathise with companies like coinbase as they bear the brunt of regulation/observation by the ignorant businesses they're disrupting, but "you're in a hole? I'll write an email and escalate it until we email you" is just not appropriate. "I'll get on the phone and have one of our senior support people call you immediately" is more what I'd expect. If their business model doesn't support dealing with actual real business customers then they will always be playing in the shallow end.

@_date: 2015-07-30 19:49:35
I can only speak of my experience (although I've a background in QA etc too). I've bought from them twice. The first time I wound up the slider as far as it went and waited for my stuff to arrive. The second time I did the same and it went up even further!
It was pitched to me as "magic 50% discount on Amazon stuff" and I took it as such.
I'm no idiot and maybe I've been lucky. I feel misled and abused by purse as a result of what I've read on here about the risks of higher discounts.
Trial and error don't empower the user in a business-sustainable way if they either are or just feel ripped off.
TLDR sell it to me as "you choose your risk" rather than "you choose your discount" and we won't need this conversation.

Raspberry Pi / 2 just isn't very well suited to this job. It's much better suited to other things.
Your experience will be this:
- mess about for ages compiling bitcoind
- forward ports from your router
- Excitedly run the daemon!
- Wait. Wait longer.
- Restart it when it crashes. 
- Repeat the last two about 300 times. 
- After two or more weeks, get hopelessly overexcited because it's synced!
- Occasionally watch (boring) logs rolling up your screen
- Occasionally restart it when it crashes
Really, you won't learn more about or get the feel for Bitcoin any more than if you read the wiki for a few hours. You're also tying up a neat computer you could be using for minecraft or wolfram alpha instead.
Apologies for sounding negative, but I've actually done the above. A MUCH better option is to spin up a VPS for like 50usd/yr running Linux and put bitcoind on that. Then spend all the time you've saved playing with your neat Rpi and reading/learning about Bitcoin.
Edit: I see some people are raving about what a great experience this is. Let me clarify: if you're already experienced in building and running servers, the experience is mundane verging on dull. If you want to learn how to do that stuff, then it's probably interesting, but it's not much to do with Bitcoin.

You've misunderstood me. I get that there are reasons. 999/1000 people will see "50%" and go straight for that without wondering any further than "moar discount!".
If it's advantageous for the long term for purse to have people NOT default to 50% they need to manage the customer experience to persuade them so. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 12:47:05
I had this from their November release until their January release. Deleting and reinstalling their app didn't solve the problem, so I believe it's just buggy code dealing with something from their servers. It was reported to them and they acknowledged the fault in early November and it took them two months to fix it.
Meanwhile the app still doesn't have feature parity with their web site, so I still have one choice only to instantly buy Bitcoin when mobile- the Circle app.
The cluephone is ringing for these engineers and nobody is answering it. I wonder how many other people want to buy instantly from a debit card when mobile and have to use Circle instead?

We once had a developer who came out as top of the hit parade when some suit decided this was the best judge of productivity. On closer inspection it turned out his code was just ten times the size of everybody else's to do the same job. He was literally turning our product to shit whilst looking to our naive directors like a golden boy. I fired him. The next week I was hauled in front of the CEO to explain why I'd fired our best coder.
Our actual best coder, who made small, considered and efficient code changes was halfway down the magic list. A recently-hired student who had accidentally deleted a bunch of code and had to revert it all was near the top of the list.
I'm not saying there's no correlation between LOC and competence, but one has to be very careful and diligent in understanding the underlying mechanisms of how we got to these magic lists.

Bitcoin doesn't have a concept of account policing. Any wallet accepts any funds. Only when you trust your funds to third parties is it possible for them to be controlled by someone other than yourself. Once you go down that road, it sort of defeats the biggest advantage of Bitcoin over fiat.
TLDR buy a Trezor/ledger/keepkey and control your own funds.

An article saying how successful bitcoin is in Prague hosted on the “bitcoin conference in Prague” web site? No bias there, surely.
Other things of note: this conference has been really uninviting for the few years they’ve held it- I’ve personally chosen not to go to it every time because it was ridiculously expensive to attend, for-profit, and the speakers/programme was dreadful. Compared to the excellent work of it’s doing very little to evangelise crypto in the city.
There is lots of interest in crypto in Prague and the Czech Republic but nowhere like as much as the article implies.
If you want to get a feel for adoption checkout  for places in Prague that accept bitcoin.

It's not the exchanges getting hacked, although this may happen. It's more the horror stories of exchanges confiscating funds, probably on suspicion of illegal activity. If you own your private keys, then you are the bank and nobody on the planet can touch your funds. The corollary to this is that you are therefore responsible for the security of your funds and if you lose them, they are gone permanently. This responsibility is too much for some people just as keeping $1m in cash at your home might be, so they choose to leave their funds on exchanges as you might leave your cash in a bank.

Just a thing to think about: sometimes people are unresponsive for reasons beyond their control. Sometimes people die. Sometimes people get ill. What I'm saying is that there might be a way forward with this, particularly given that both parties benefit from releasing the coin. Maybe you offer 50/50? Maybe you consider 75/25 acceptable? Human beings are surprisingly easily influenced when money for no work is on the table.
Even if I made myself uncontactable to my worst enemy, as the price of Bitcoin rises, it's sure going to get more and more appealing to get back in touch to share part of the funds in our shared-for-life 2-of-2 wallet. Will he still hate you when BTC is 10000USD?
Another angle is this: if the guy did die, then maybe those controlling his estate know nothing about Bitcoin, how to access it, etc. Your approach requires tact and diplomacy, however.

Did he own a Trezor (small grey keyfob)? These can be secured using the 24 word seed and also a passphrase. The passphrase isn't a success or failure thing though- entering *anything at all* acts as an extra secret seed word and gives you access to a passphrase-specific set of addresses.
You can verify the seed words from the wordlist ; the passphrase **must** be correct though to access the funds.
It might be worth trying the seed words backwards too, or maybe your brother had a secret way of ordering them beyond forwards/backwards.

Your "Confidence" section makes no sense to me. Trezor does all that stuff with the exception of showing you a receive address (how does that benefit anyway?).
(Edit: I'm pretty sure my Trezor shows me a QR when I'm on the receive funds screen, come to think of it- will check later.)
I also don't understand your complaints about mobile support, for three reasons:
- These are meant to be hard to spend from- they're cold storage. Use a hot wallet on your phone for spending.
- If you really want to spend from a Trezor, open mycelium, plug your Trezor in, and spend. No fuss.
- Import your Trezor xpub into mycelium and you can receive direct to your Trezor without even having it with you.
I can't think of a use case of Trezor and mobile that isn't satisfied at the moment, so it seems weird to be saying that it could be improved. Plus of course you don't want to be spending from your cold storage whilst mobile as that opens you up to a $5 wrench attack (mitigated by plausible deniability).
Apologies for appearing to be explicitly defending Trezor- I don't have a keepkey.

"Bugginess" is not a security flaw. It is an indicator of the willingness of the developer to overlook bugs they know about, which is itself an indicator that the developer is content also to overlook *bugs they don't know about*.
I won't give you a lesson on making software, but let's leave it at this: pros do not ship obvious defects. It makes them look unprofessional and erodes public confidence.
Whether they chose to ship obvious bugs or whether they *didn't notice they were shipping obvious bugs*, their QA process needs a lot of work before I'll be securing my finances with their product.
As to your second point; trust is earned in open source projects in many ways. I trust hot wallets like Bread for several reasons
- source availability: I can and do sometimes read code
- ubiquity: the more a product is used, the more bugs are found and fixed
- transparency: I haven't read all the source code, but I bet every part of it has been scrutinised at some point
- reputation: If the dev has a good quality process and public presence
And of course I mitigate any losses by keeping just pocket money in a phone wallet. How much I trust the wallet is directly related to how much cash I will trust it with.
Maybe you could educate me further and explain how I can buy a coffee or beer with bitcoin without a hot wallet?

GA only added an API to allow access to BCH after lots of negativity was sent their way. For a couple of weeks it looked like users of their 2of2 wallet would *never* be given access to their BCH.
Credit to them, they spent a bit of effort to give access and even reviewed a *user-contributed* version of their recovery tool which gave access to their users' BCH.
If you are using GreenAddress 2of2 **then you need their help to access your altcoins in the event of a fork**, which means your coins may be locked up forever. The solution is to only use 2of3 accounts from GreenAddress.

Sorry, but you’re wrong- maybe you’re misunderstanding me. **If** you verify an email address you can get nlocktime backup transactions, but those transactions are pre-signed *on the BTC blockchain*. If you want to move the new BTC2 forkcoins you just got for free, **you cannot move them without GreenAddress supporting BTC2**. Your forkcoins are not under your control.
You need a 2of3 wallet to allow you to safely be able to sign transactions on any blockchain without GreenAddress.

They didn't help people much with BCH.

Not easily. :)
GreenAddress has two products- a "2of2" wallet, which requires your signature *and their signature* to release funds, and a "2of3" wallet which requires two out of your signature, your extra signature, and their signature to release funds.
The first one is not safe in the event of a fork because it requires them to sign a transaction on a chain they might not -ever- support, so you will be left with no access to your "free" altcoins, which may very well be worth a lot of money. If your free altcoins are incredibly successful and are selling for $1000000 each, this will be very frustrating!
If you have a "2of3" wallet, you can use your two keys to move your altcoins without any help from GreenAddress.
Does this help? If not it's worth reading up on n-of-m signature wallets.

If you must use GreenAddress, use a 2of3 wallet so you do not need their help to rescue your altcoins in the event of a fork. **A 2of2 wallet needs their support to liberate your forkcoins**, i.e. you do not own the new coins.

It is not as simple as you think. Taxes are not nominal- they're black and white unless you're a large corporation.

I once worked for Microsoft. We had "Microsoft" Amex cards but they were personal, despite having the company name on them. It was not unusual to charge $5k to the card, which technically should be cleared that month. I once paid a day late for administrative reasons. Amex charged me some fine- maybe ten dollars. I resented that, and remembered it.
When I left Microsoft I overpaid my MS Amex card by maybe $0.5. As a result they cannot close my account and have spent around $0.7 every month sending me a final statement. I left MS in early 2003 and still get the monthly statements from the US. That's 14 years multiplied by 12 times 70 cents. I'm winning this one.

Google something like "do I need to do a tax return" and you'll probably find out that the answer is yes. It's not voluntary if you have earnings / unpaid tax to declare (ie you are probably committing fraud by not filling one in), and the criteria are fairly slim. For instance, my first tax return was a result of earning maybe $40 on US stock dividends. I was automatically sent a tax return to fill in in 2001 and have been sent one every year since.
TLDR you'll get sent one when they figure it out but it's technically fraud if you don't do it voluntarily when you know you should.
EDIT just to be clear my post is about the mechanics of tax returns. If earning capital through BTC is not taxable then you may not need to bother with a tax return. OTOH it may be grounds for you to have to do a TR even if it's not resulting in income for HMRC.

This would seem harsh but it really represents how "professional" software companies work. New operating system releases usually require very minor changes if they're source-incompatible and these changes are advertised well before the OS is released. Not following this software Dev pattern incurs huge support and loyalty costs as customers are left without working software. 
TLDR it's cheaper to fix this stuff when the beta iOS is out. Only a company focused directly on short term cash goals or in crisis/turmoil would **not** do this.

Apologies for sounding a little negative... Professional coder here...
The math(s) for generating a public bitcoin address from a 160 bit random private key is almost trivial. This would be a great exercise for a budding C++ coder and would impress a tutor/examiner at school.
Secondly, using libraries as a programmer is not really programming. :( Seriously- it's a discipline, and very helpful, but if you need to code a clean room implementation from scratch (like you're on the cutting edge of innovation or creating IP for a private company) then you likely won't have any libraries to play with. 
Thirdly, asking about problems linking C++ code to C libs is a question for and the solution is "get it to link" and not "find a different library".  :) If the "official C library" doesn't link correctly then there are likely problems with that code which you can probably help fix to benefit lots of people in your position.
Apols to this sub for geeky shiz.

I can't speak for TransferWise but I've used CurrencyFair and was really impressed by this "revolutionary" tech. For those who don't know, these companies operate much like LocalBitcoins- they're just brokering a deal between two private entities as well as escrowing the finances. Ironically I discovered them right after using a "conventional" Forex company to move some money abroad. CurrencyFair would have saved me a huge amount of money for that transaction. I still regularly move small amounts of money abroad with CurrencyFair as they're so cost-effective for small amounts.
Bitcoin is, if you like, the next step, but I really wouldn't want the pain of, for example, converting enough money to buy a property abroad into Bitcoin, then at the other end trying to purchase directly in Bitcoin or convert back into local currency. Getting in and out of Bitcoin has too much friction at this point- I'd rather pay a little more and have one currency conversion instead of (potentially) two.

They do seem determined to break everything that once worked fine. In August I could instantly buy 100GBP/ day Bitcoin, was all verified up and raring to go. Between then and today they dropped my limit to £25/ day with no communication or warning (still don't know why), didn't respond to my support ticket, and recently advised me to re-verify with their new system. This required me to delete my currently- verified docs, and start again using their (now-broken) website. This didn't work and they couldn't tell me why (I suspect it needs flash, just as the rest of the world is moving away from flash). I managed to re-verify with their iOS app, so can buy again, but now their iOS app crashes at startup. In between all that, their support people have failed to read my words before responding to them and generally been helpful in every way but solving my problems.
Really, all signs of a company that is growing far too quickly. Making it hard and indeed impossible at times to be a customer of theirs after months of satisfaction does not seem like a business making progress to me.

It was in the media recently that an entity is trying to set up a Bitcoin exchange in Jamaica. I am astounded that any Jamaican authority would even shake hands with any proposer of this idiocy. I am therefore alarmed that, according to the deputy governor of the Bank of Jamaica Livingstone Morrison,”We have had some exploratory discussions with them, talking about the regulatory framework and the process that would have to be engaged in order for them to secure approval so they can offer the service.” The Gleaner, September 18, 2016)
Bitcoin and its proponents are not to be recognised; they should be chased away. Cash Plus — flawed as it was — had more merits than Bitcoin. And the fact that Bitcoin is being recognised is a reflection of the intellectual inadequacies that now rule countries and the globe.
What is Bitcoin? It is currency plain and simple. Any country that allows a private citizen to create currency has lost its mind. What will the authorities do when Mary Jane decides to reintroduce shark teeth as currency? Or Dorlan H decides to issue “Ginger Ridge Script” (copying the Colonial Script that was issued in pre-revolutionary America)? Will the authority say that Bitcoin is computer-generated so therefore it has validity? But since “Ginger Ridge Script” is printed the old-fashioned way, or even on a 3-D printer, it has no similar value?
The issuing of currency is and ought to remain the sole prerogative of one central authority. Money supply must be heavily regulated and tightly controlled. Money is a medium of exchange used to circulate goods and services. Money has to be in proper proportions to the amount of goods and services that is to be circulated. If there is more money than goods and services hyperinflation can occur.
  
But it is significant to note that if an oversupply of money does not cause inflation it can nevertheless blow up the economy. It was an oversupply of money caused by the then Government’s unrelenting tax cuts, and its refusal to spend, which led to the blowing up of the American economy and that of the globe in 1929. The same oversupply of money was again present in 2007 blowing up America’s economy and that of the globe when George W Bush unleashed over US$2 trillion of tax cuts in 2003.
In short, money can be too much! And when any Tom, Dick or Harriet is allowed to create currency that is a recipe for financial and economic madness!
A spin-off of Bitcoin is Caricoin. The report stated that Caricoin has a development office in Kingston and a spokesperson for Caricoin said: “It is focused on delivering a secure, user-friendly, and less costly way of storing wealth and moving it around.” Wealth?! How was this wealth created? This is 1636 all over again and the tulip bulbs are coming. Soon it will be tulip mania once more. Such thinking must be killed in its infancy!
Governments need to understand where they can allow innovation and where no innovation should be permitted when dealing with money. Transactional innovation is good and should be encouraged. Moving from metal alloy coins as currency to paper and now polymer is fine and convenient. The introduction of cheques was good. It saved people having to walk around with millions of dollars to transact business. Wire transfers and interac debit transactions are all useful innovations which facilitate transactions. Any additional innovation in this regard should be welcomed. Any whiz kid can brainstorm and come up with more and new ideas that will help people transact business.
The creation of currency, however, is a whole other matter. That should be the business of one central authority. Bitcoin is currency created on a computer. What did the creators do to acquire the value they claim for Bitcoin? Was it by fiat? Or was it because fools chose to bid on it? How is this different from people who in 1636 were exchanging an estate for one tulip bulb which previously fetched the price of an ordinary onion?

To some degree this is understandable. They spend a fortune on enhancing their OS with new features (demanded by users and developers) and bug fixes and developers leave their apps to stagnate for years, creating both a backward-compatibility burden and leaving new "better" features unused.

The currently-accepted reference implementation is maintained by a few developers. You, I, and your boss have complete freedom to fork the code and create a new version, then convince everyone that it's better than the current most-popular version. In fact this happens all the time when a new version is released. Check on bitnode for how many tens of earlier and different versions are running today. Who is maintaining them? Who knows!
As an aside, I know from (bitter?) personal experience that having many developers involved in a technical decision-making process is a great way to make zero progress; not necessarily because of egos or ideologies but sometimes simply because developers like to over-analyse interesting geeky stuff and ignore boring decision-making.

No. I'm privileged as an old fart software engineer as I have a strong mathematical background. The maths is sound. We don't just have one chance at this. You're absolutely confusing the model with the implementation. We will iterate until this works. This is exactly how all software is made.
Just look at the existing history of Bitcoin and the blockchain. Certain software events have even occasioned rewinding the blockchain and still we trust the value and belief we've stored there.
Above all the consensus model means that you, me, or anyone could tomorrow invent the implementation that everyone likes the most and uses.
I think you believe that the one true model can be perfectly implemented and sadly that isn't the nature of software. Bugs exist because coders are stupid or lazy and QA is imperfect and best-effort and under-resourced.
I'm almost sorry to be disagreeing with you like this because at one time I would have had your exact opinion. Years of practical software-making has ruined my idealism. When you ship a release that finds a hardware bug in a million devices you patch and release again *fast and at any cost*.
There's no such thing as a rogue developer because as I mentioned we all are owners of the maths/code.

Hi. I visited my first Bitcoin cafe a week ago. I had a coffee and a beer, and when I went to pay I pointed my phone at the terminal and typed my on-device pin. The payment was made. I was incredibly impressed by the experience, and specifically that the Bitcoin part was almost trivial compared to the coffee shop part.
I carry two phones, both with enough bitcoins for a coffee and a sandwich. One is a low end but recent android device and one is the most expensive and recent iPhone.
Neither devices do NFC. I would not have been able to carry out my transaction if NFC were the only option.
Your focus on NFC seems all wrong to me. I don't see how the UX can be improved beyond the QR code experience, given that I want to type some kind of pin for my own peace of mind. Your rationale seems to come down to pointing a camera vs waving a phone about (which I can't do despite over $1500 worth of phones in my pocket). This seems like you're choosing the most exclusive option for some invented reasoning.

Data moved about before the Internet as we know it existed. To support the blockchain, there'd need to be fast links between nodes and miners but transactions could still be practical over modems/radio/sneakernet. With billions of dollars at stake, I'd be surprised if someone didn't find a way.
Edit: Just rereading my second sentence, it could in fact describe the pre-commercial internet of the early 90s. There were few well connected but politically and financially independent "nodes" and a million ways for consumers to connect and move data to and from those "nodes".

I totally disagree. It's hard to buy bitcoin for non-geeks. Bitcoin ATMs are terrifying and alien to someone who doesn't know the first thing about Bitcoin but that they want to buy some. Having a human being to guide and reassure makes the whole ecosystem of bitcoin accessible to the majority who don't understand it.

The trunk of Bitcoin is still curated, albeit not by denying access. Any malicious changes can be immediately detected and understood. If you are the kind of person who entrusts your money to a live codebase without engaging in the community, then this is not the only way in life you might come unstuck.
My point stands - that it's not unusual to have a source tree which is protected from sometimes even senior developers. Removing Gavin's privilege has no bearing on the making of the Bitcoin software product.
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:30:35
Er, this is slightly off topic, but cheap international credit cards exist. I personally use a uk-issued credit card for travelling abroad which lets me take out cash in any currency and, provided I settle in full within that payment period, the only charge is about 1% off the interbank rate. I'm guessing that if such a card exists, there must be some benefit for the bank, and therefore other banks will issue a similar card for the same benefit.
TLDR Shop around. Cheap exchange cards exist.

I totally disagree with your first paragraph. I know completely non-technical people who hold on a paper wallet perfectly safely and now have 8x the value they started with. They need to know: **"Do not lose this paper wallet or you lose your money"**. That's easy to grasp. In fact one person I'm thinking of is so non-technical she still has an old Nokia and rarely uses email.
I have two non-technical friends who hold and occasionally buy bitcoin. I advise them on all matters relating to bitcoin. I enable them to participate. I estimate I spend five minutes a month on each of them, to my timetable, which sometimes means I have to put them off for a day or two. A visitor to WBTCB can have a hundred times as much attention- on demand.
My two friends are very, very happy with their bitcoin and constantly spread the word to others which benefits me and you.
What you seem to be suggesting is that 
- people need to be bitcoin experts to use bitcoin safely
- people who are not bitcoin experts should not be allowed to use bitcoin
The evidence I've presented seems to contradict this.
If you're now saying that people visiting WBTCB are subject to predatory practices then you're simply wrong. There are two Bitcoin ATMs there which largely work themselves, with an operator on hand to help if it's needed. There's no hard selling as such. Advice is given when requested.
It seems we are set to continue to disagree.

Without intending to be directly insulting, this really sounds like the commentary of a software engineer who is inexperienced. Most modern software processes are sufficiently complex that QA cycles cannot even dream of competing with a controlled rollout and prepared iteration cycle.
The days of stage, test, release, are well and truly over. Software is too hard. Better to make changes and be prepared to instantly step back or push a fix.

If you build from a random and unstabilised codebase, then you get whatever you get. It could be any old crap. Build from the release branch which has changes triaged and curated for just this reason.
Edit: To be absolutely clear: the trunk of Bitcoin is not the Wild West. There is still a process in place for accepting changes. There is however some small risk a rogue developer could make changes and someone build the code before those changes are reverted.

Dev manager here. There have been times when if I'd had my way, NO devs would have commit access. I'm surprised they've removed Gavin's access but it really makes no difference. Before his - or anyone else's - commits are shipped they need to be integrated and tested. Whether he personally applies changes to the tree or not is pretty irrelevant.
Also, don't forget this is access to a change management system. If he deleted everything or introduced problematic code, the tools and processes are there to rollback those changes. 
TLDR Some devs contribute meaningfully to projects for years without direct commit rights.

@_date: 2016-05-12 14:00:51
Sending anything unencrypted through email is as good as printing it out and displaying it at a bus stop. You're publicly exposing 50% of your secret seed.
Using any online service (or even unaudited offline code) to protect your million is crazy. That code could be doing anything at all with your the secrets that protect your million, including caching your secret until it finds Internet connectivity some time in the future. Even using a proprietary(?) service like passphrase.io is a bad idea since their maths might be suspect and flawed.
So I stand by my comment that both your suggestions have been risky and I personally would not protect my million using either of them.

The equations are essentially irrelevant. You take an input, and get an output and if that output is within a certain range, you win bitcoins. It really is that simple.
I always explain to friends like there's no equation. So I ask "choose a number between 1 and 20". If they're thinking of the same number as I chose they win free bitcoins. If not, try again. Then instead of 20 as an upper limit they must try to win some Bitcoin by choosing the same number as I do between 1 and a million. Then a million million. And so on. They still can't perceive the mind-manglingly huge numbers involved but I've essentially shown them how to get there.

In your case not only is your word unsearchable, but to find it people will probably try to search for your *competitor* to find you. "Yours Reddit copy" would be my first guess at trying to differentiate you from just the keyword "yours".
Add to that that you're using a new "lets-invent-a-zillion-new-domains-for-no-reason" domain, which I read just a few seconds ago and have already forgotten; I'd try yours.com and yours.net; I think you should do more research around searchability and being memorable.
"Yours" definitely sounds cooler than "Datt", but I think you're using that to be blinded to that linguistically and practically it's hugely problematic.
Just my 2p.
Update: Ok so I just read the post where you describe the name change motivation. It contains nothing about how users will find you; nothing about being memorable; just horrible romantic arty marketing speak for an unbrandable word.

However, there's little difference in terms of what you're left with. Both generate a paper way of accessing your bitcoins- either your paper wallet or your backup list of words.

It depends whether you're prepared to shoulder the responsibility of literally being your own bank, and the complications involved with that.
If you have a fairly detailed understanding of how Bitcoin works and are comfortable with genuinely securing a computer (you can guarantee it has not been compromised) then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend you control your own keys. A hardware wallet like ledger or trezor helps hugely here but security still needs consideration. You will still need to absolutely secure your seed words - for as long as you need the power to control those coins. You'll need to think about what happens to those words if there's a flood or fire or ... or ...
If not, then Coinbase is a popular online bank for Bitcoin. It will sometimes be down; the interface might sometimes be confusing; but they have tech support to help you and your money is insured privately and covered by FDIC if you're in the US. You do not directly control your funds, but as with any bank you direct your funds.
Coinbase gets a bad rap for the practical reason that they're often down and that they are compelled by anti-money-laundering laws to police your account; also for the ideological reason that since Bitcoin allows us to own our private keys, why would we not do that? However, non-geeks might not be best suited for the Bitcoin ecosystem in its raw form and Coinbase helps here. I often see posts on which betray a complete lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works and from people investing not-insignificant amounts of money into it. These posts scare the shit out of me.
TLDR If you understand how Bitcoin works and are happy with the huge responsibility of literally being your own bank, get a hardware wallet and go for it. If not, Coinbase is a good compromise, so long as you understand you do not own those coins (like any bank).

Especially this comment 
Also note OP is in touch with the wallet's authors (their email is both obvious and in the thread) and that nobody has yet confirmed any theft. In fact there's at least one poster whose transaction went through after he thought it was being stolen.
We don't need this kind of knee-jerk paranoia. If you own your keys you control your coins.

Except that gox is almost or actually dollar-solvent now so might pay out those "few ten dollars". :)

I philosophically side with I think it's stupid that we don't deploy a very low risk interim solution of increasing the block size to support bitcoin's facility.
But man, that sub is full of violence. It's like the worst kind of vi/emacs software religion. But whereas real nerds grow past operating system and editor preferences it's like there's wave after wave of angry recruit in btc to shout about blocksize and create more conflict.
