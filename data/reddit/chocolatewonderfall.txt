Yea hes got OK views on bitcoin but his views on fiat currencies are insane and uneducated. The dollar has lost 97% of its value since 1913! Annnddddd why does that matter? Its also been the single greatest period of economic growth in the countrys history. 
Obviously paul doesnt understand something here.

I think what Not_Pictured was getting at is that there would not longer be large amounts of money involved if you pulled off a successful 51% attack. The market value of bitcoins would tank the second it became obvious

I do.....?
And also theres not really a drug dealer support fund for these people to donate to...so maybe use your brain before you type next time?


Im not giving a penny to anyone. Do you see me posting about my donations to ross? I just recognize that he shouldnt be in jail. And also that you're a retard.

Oh the austrian economics is strong with this one....&amp;


No actually thats just a fact of any economy regardless of inflation. If no one spends money no one gets any income, thats just an economic reality, an accounting axiom. It has nothing to do with the federal reserve or inflation. 


This is why people dont come to this subreddit. I own and use bitcoin reguarly but that was just fucking stupid. Anything can be a store of value. Dollars, no matter how much you irrationally hate them, are a store of value. Gold is a store of value. Any commodity that doesnt depreciate rapidly is a store of value. 
Stop being so irrational, it makes all of us look bad. like rabid teenage libertarians that just took their first economics class. Jesus.
