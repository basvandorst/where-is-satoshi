No. 
My final answer is: 
the value of gold comes from real use cases, like jewelry, because of properties described.
Later, people seeking a store of value, choosed gold because it has a legitimate demand and its scarce and durable.
Every asset with legitimate demand, scarce and non perishable its a good store of value. The problem is, gold is the perfect one, because there are not many assets with all those properties together.
Bitcoin could be a great SoV, but for that it needs the legitimate demand. The legitimate demand in bitcoin comes from the payment system. All the other properties are already in bitcoin from the beginning (durability etc).
Indeed bitcoin has better properties than gold to be a SoV because of its digital nature. But if you remove the legitimate demand, bitcoin can't be a SoV. 
Creating a SoV without legitimate demand, without real use cases is a ponzi scheme. There is no need for bitcoin to be a ponzi, since it has legitimate use cases: the payment system.
So, every user trying to buy coffee, far from doing a "cute thing", its adding deamand for the payment system: the only real and legitimate demand for bitcoins.

This 3% was already factored into the price and it was impossible for me not to pay it. And more importantly, stores not accepting Visa or credit card DO NOT have lower prices here, so this 3% is paid by the merchant as a service, to avoid the need to handle cash (security etc). 
So, let's face reality: Visa is really good. Bitcoin can be better, but for that we need a Bitcoin that works. 
There is no way we can take down the banking system with a non working payment system. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:09:48
So basically what you are saying is that Bitcoin only works to buy lambos right now. 
Since I'm not interested in lambos, I guess Bitcoin is not for me? I got into Bitcoin as a revolutionary tool banking the unbanked, sorry, maybe I misunderstood the whole point of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:47:58


No, you are not getting lectured. This is a discussion board. This is a community with tons of people and tons of different opinions.
If you are offended because other people engaged into an interesting debate regarding the topics you raised, you should reconsider what are you doing here. 


By constantly attacking and saying that people disagreeing with you are just "low iq people" you don't look smarter, you look rude and foolish. 


Using Bitcoin to buy coffee is not "a cute way". It's a basic use case for replacing the banking system, you like it or not. If I can't buy daily things with Bitcoin I will continue to use traditional banks. 


Bitcoin has never gone mainstream regarding adoption as a payment system. That would be great, but still not happened. 
So, the value was low because Bitcoin was not as popular as of today. Remember: correlation is not causation. 


Most people nowadays are pumping money into it to get rich quick. They buy bitcoins dreaming about selling them later for way more money. Very few individuals are interested in how to replace banks etc, they are interested into buying bitcoins, leaving them in coinbase 1 year, sell later for 10x fiat. That's it. They dream about buying lambos, not about a world without banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:16:35
I can make the same picture, changing the labels to tons of other things.
Correlation is not causation, you are cherry picking the correlations aligned with your beliefs: this is called confirmation bias.
For example, the labels could have been: "bitcoin is not in the media" and "bitcoin is in the media". Or "bitcoin still not mainstream" and "bitcoin becomes mainstream". 
People using bitcoin as a SoV is the end of bitcoin. I recommend you this reading, very interesting: 
You like it or not, the only value for bitcoin comes from the payment system it enables.
What you refer as a SoV its in reality the Greater fool theory:
I truly believe in bitcoin, I believe the banks will be unnecesary in the future, but for that to happen people should be able to buy coffee with bitcoin. And I also believe we will get there :)
In the meantime, we need to wait and let the technology improve. But no, people trying to use bitcoin EXACTLY for what it was build is not a "cute thing" by any means. And no, a price increase not backed by adoption is pure speculation, and is not helping bitcoin in any way. 
Edit: grammar, typos.

I agree with you about the hate speech. However, the situation is much better in general regarding police and government surveillance.

So, basically you stated that gold has value because people use it as a store of value, and not the other way around. You said this is how it is expressed in austrian theory of economy. 
I shared with you some links from mises.org where you can clearly see that you were wrong. From mises.org, the value of gold comes from its real use before being use as Money or SoV. 
Now, you are suggesting the same circular reference again. You believe bitcoin would be a great SoV without the payment system. And again, if there are no uses for bitcoin aside from SoV, then the demand for bitcoin is not stable and its very volatile. In order to use bitcoin as a SoV you need some value first, because you store value in bitcoin by exchanging valuable things for bitcoins, hoping to retain the value for the future.
If people only exchange for bitcoins because other people believe bitcoins are valuable but nobody uses bitcoins for anything else than SoV, then its a ponzi scheme and it will run until we run out of fools. 
Bitcoin doesn't need to operate like that, since bitcoin allows for the best payment system ever to exist, so the demand for bitcoins is guaranteed as long as there are users for the payment system. 
So, no users paying with bitcoin, no real demand for bitcoin = volatility and unstability = poor SoV.
Either Austrian theory or Keynesian economics agree on this. The differences between those two school of economy are about other topics.

Each full node decides on its own the rules it follow. However, with exchange centralization and with Bitcoin users mostly interested in buying bitcoins, leaving them in the exchange, just to sold them later for Fiat ... The rules imposed by coinbase, bitrrex and bitfinex are way more important than the rules imposed by your node. 
Most users today aren't interested into using Bitcoin as a payment system, as Satoshi envisioned, they are interested into speculate with their fiat to get more fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:53:09
same here
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:56:35
The centralization of miners has diverse consequences.
The most important one is the ability to halt the network. If miners agree on mining a sha256 alt with their equipment, they are halting the Bitcoin network, making transactions impossible or very very slow and at the same time they are not loosing money in the process. 
Miner centralization is a huge problem, and it creates lots of shenanigans.

Or just use Visa and it's virtually free, since the cost of Visa is already factored into the product. And it's the same price if I pay with Visa or with cash.

Remember that coinbase and the rest also run full nodes, and their full nodes decide the balance you see in your exchange, and sadly this is the important thing for most people as of today.

My two cents..
To begin with, buying a fucking cup of coffee means "to transact". And the whole point of the banking system is to allow individuals and organizations  to transact.
That being said, you can't decentralize the banking system if you don't scale. I'm not defending BCH here, I think the solution is lightning, but your post is childish. You try to minimize the problem just because we still don't have the solution. 
I'm sorry, I also want Bitcoin to be great, and of course, I would love to see those problems fixed as of today, but my wills don't change the fact that those problems are still there. 
I used to be like you, but this type of reasoning is hurting Bitcoin more than helping. 
We should accept the current limitations and drawbacks of Bitcoin, and work together to improve it. Denying the problems and making fun of the affected users is a very bad idea.

People don't give a fuck about "the central banking system". Satoshi created a paper about a P2P electronic cash system. 
From the white paper, first line, first paragraph:
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution.
From the conclusion, first line:
We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.
So, I don't know what do you think you "understood" but Bitcoin was conceived as a payment system to allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution :) 
So, when someone wants to buy a fucking coffee using bitcoin, this person is trying to use Bitcoin EXACTLY for what it was created: to transact. 
Your beliefs about what you consider the central banking system etc are all very interesting, but the general public don't give a shit about it. What's important for the average Joe is the ability to transact. To transact faster, to transact freely, to transact cheap, to transact securely, etc. 
We will solve today problems, Bitcoin is very early stage tech. But in the meantime, don't blame the users for trying to use Bitcoin exactly for what it was created: to buy things.

This is the type of borderline internet posts that got people arrested here, where I live. Of course, it would happen that when this type of news reach you in the US, it looks like people are getting picked up and questioned because of expressing their honest general views and thoughts.

Gold was used in jewelry because it was a scarce metal easy to work with. So, the best looking pieces of jewelry were made of gold. 
What was the alternative?
- wood:  looks cheap, humidiy affects wood. Not durable. 
- leather: not durable at all.
- other metals: get rusted, your piece of jewelry perishes with time.
- stone: impossible to create fine jewelry with stone (stone doesn't melt easily) with ancient tech. So near impossible for them to create fine rings and similar items just with stone.
So, please, explain me how an ancient civilization could have created fine durable jewelry without gold.
Let me guess: they can't. 
this, combined with the scarcity of gold, created the perfect material for jewelry, durable, easy to work with, good looking finish and scarce. 
Edit: value in money is not generated magically, like you are suggesting. I would like to introduce you the Mises regression theorem:

So, since I don't need censorship resistance to buy coffee and all other stuff i buy daily, that means I should stick to Visa and banks, and use Bitcoin just to buy lambos, right?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:06:06
The cost for paying with Visa is already factored into the final price of the product. No merchant offers discount for paying with cash. 
How can a merchant factor Bitcoin fees into the cost, if fees are $2 and the next day are $20 and later $6 and so on? It's impossible.
The point I'm trying to make is Bitcoin is a payment system and it should allow individuals to pay for things using it. Right now this is not the case. 
You pay, and wait sometimes for days (if we happen to be under attack). You try to guess a fee so your payment goes through and sometimes you screw and your payment is there forever.


So... I will be pointed as a "non believer" and then my arguments will be invalid automatically? I thought Bitcoin was about something else, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:27:16
There are many and complex reasons. 
Gold was a very interesting metal. Hard enough to make durable objects, very stable (it doesn't rust) and at the same time very malleable and ductile, allowing ancient people to build complex objects out of it, without heavy machinery.
So, basically gold was one of the best metals for lots of use cases, easy to transform and to work with and doesn't rust.
Of course, being a metal but at the same time not getting rusted makes it ideal for jewelry. As of today, gold is used for lots of industrial applications. Gold has been used to build the computers (smartphones, laptops, etc) we use right now. 
So, basically gold is a scarce non rusting, malleable, ductile, hypoallergenic and conductive metal. If you think about it its fucking amazind and the use cases are near endless. 
Can you please explain me the properties that give bitcoin its value as a "store of value"? I can: the payment system. Bitcoin is the best payment system ever. If you remove the payment system, can you please explain me how it can be a store of value if its not because of the greatest fool theory? 


I'm an economist by training. But I think arguments of authority are not needed here, neither valid. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:03:13


I wasn't lecturing you. I was expressing my opinion and general views regarding the topics you introduced :)
It looks like we don't have the same views, but thats ok. 


I don't misconstructed the meaning of your post. You expressed certain opinions regarding Satoshi's vision and people trying to use bitcoin for certain use cases, and I expressed my opinion regarding the exact same topics. 
And please, stop being rude, its not necessary. 


Using bitcoin for coffee would be amazing and would allow me and millions of people to stop using credit cards and banks in general. This is why we are excited about lightning.
Its not a cute way, its the most basic use case for removing the banks.


No, because bitcoin doesn't scale for now. Each time someone tries to buy coffee and discovers its impossible, its another individual that will continue to use banks.


My point is that you expressed that bitcoin gained in value because people perceive it a store of value, and I believe thats not the case. Bitcoin gained value because there are tons of speculators right now trying to get rich quick, and this kind of users are not the ones needed to get rid of the banks: the ones you need are the ones trying to buy coffee.
So, for you, a REAL bitcoin user trying to use this payment system to buy things is a "fool" trying to do "cute things". But all those bitcoin speculators are real demand and adds intrinsic value to bitcoin. check your comments, this is exactly what you expressed.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:11:46
Well, you think i'm wrong. But I think that SoV can't be a demand on itself. 
I believe gold was first used for jewelry, and later people started using it as a SoV, knowing that there will be demand for gold to make jewelry in the future.
Creating a useless asset and saying that SoV is a legitimate demand, and enough to create a solid SoV is wrong, it will create a bubble/mania and it will burst. 
I also think bitcoin could be a better SoV than gold, but for that to happen we need real demand, and in my opinion, the only real use case for bitcoin is the payment system.
Think about it, "store of value" means that you have some value that you want to store for the future. You have the value in apples, but apples are perishable, so you exchange your apples for something that you believe it will retain the value for the future.
In order to retain the value, it should be durable and the ratio supply/demand should be stable. Scarcity guarantees the supply ratio is stable, and stable metals like gold, guarantee the durability. 
But, if there is no demand aside from other people looking for a SoV (like you), how can you predict the demand for the future? You can't, so its a shitty SoV.
If millions of people were using bitcoin as a payment network, you know for a fact that demand for bitcoin will exist. But if the only demand cames from the SoV, the confidence on the future demand is near zero.

Shitposts like this one are hurting bitcoin.
To be honest, the bitcoin as Satoshi created it, no longer exists, since bitcoin is a community and an always evolving set of rules and software. 
So, we all are free to decide the rules we want to follow, this is the true Satoshi vision: a free p2p system where every individual is free to choose his own rules. 
So, yes, Bitcoin Cash exists, is a set of rules for a protocol of a p2p electronic cash system.
I personally prefer to follow the rules of the software available at bitcoin.org, but I have zero problems with individuals following other rules, running other softwares etc.
Bitcoin is a subjective term. You can consider bitcoin whatever you want to call bitcoin, and some people will agree with you, and other people won't. 
I don't get how we can talk about taking down the central banking system, but at the same time, make fun of individuals making use of the freedom of choice created by this amazing p2p ecosystem...

I believe you are not understanding the situation. First of all, the ammount of transactions in the mempool (spam or not) is HUGE. Even alt coins like bcash would need more than 8mb blocks to process that. 
Second, the only reason for the existence of the altcoin bcash is not technological improvements like other alts, is the interest of bitmain to continue mining with AsicBoost. Maybe you are not aware that SegWit renders covert AsicBoost useless and this is a big problem for bitmain.
You are defending a group of individuals that are trying to manipulate bitcoin in order to continue using an exploit. This is not about transaction time or fees, because other alts are great at low fees and high tx, like litecoin. This is about bitmain controlling the mining, nothing else. And you are being manipulated to act as a puppet of Jihan Wu interests.

You can put all your money into Bitcoin if you want. However you should take into consideration the fact that Bitcoin it's still not mainstream. It's a promising technology and I believe in the future all of us will have all our money in Bitcoin instead of banks. 
No matter how promising Bitcoin sounds, you should be prepared for the unknown. There are literally thousands of unlikely but possible events that can seriously threaten Bitcoin in the midterm. 
Putting all your money into Bitcoin right now might end up being the best investment in your life, but it might also end up being the worst.

You can start with coinbase.com, a very serious and insured exchange. You can create an account there and start buying and selling bitcoins in minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:27:09
Register in coinbase, use your phone to upload your id, get verified and use your credit card to buy bitcoins.
As easy as that. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:51:38
It could, there is no restriction at protocol level, but its not a good idea, since you are compromising your public key. Today why have strong confidence on ECDSA (the algo protecting your private key) but its worth to have two layers of protection and not only one.

Have you ever used a Bitcoin ATM? In certain countries those machines are forced to ask you to fill a form in order to buy/sell bitcoins. The form appears in the screen for you to provide the needed information. 
Of course, we don't know if they were trying to steal the Fiat it could contain , the electronics, or the machine itself to do some reverse engineering. Or all of the above. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:02:27
Exactly, this is why I was interested in the efficiency of the joule effect in modern ASIC as a mechanism to hear domestic indoor areas. The heat pump is quite effective energy wise (up to 1watt per 3watts of heat, under normal conditions). 
Depending on the difference of efficiency of heating with joule effect with Asics this could be worth it or not. 
In lots of countries mining is economically inviable due to energy costs. It's possible that the money you save in heating up your house is not enough to make mining profitable in your country, depending on the energy costs. But to calculate that I need to know the efficiency of those machines generating heat. Not all the energy is dissipated as heat. Some energy is used for the fan itself, for example.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:14:29
Define normal heater. A heat pump is more than 100% effective, you get more heat than energy you put into it because what it does is move the heat from the outside to the inside, instead of producing heat by using energy. 
So, compared to a heat pump, the computer is way less efficient at producing heat.

every bitcoin transaction spends all of the bitcoins of the inputs. If you have 10 bitcoins into an address and create a transation sending 1btc to my address, then, the transaction created contains 1 input, your address and 2 outputs. 1btc to my output and 9 btc to another address, generated by your wallet.
So, each time you make a payment/tx, the "change" is sent to a new address.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:13:54
I don't like your opinion either, you should be castrated as well.

when I say this time is different I don't say it because of some speculative market shit. I say it from a tech point of view. This time its not china baning bitcoin. This time the attackers managed to clog the network, proving that bitcoin can be 'censored' to certain extent. 
We should not surrender, what we should do is change PoW and survive this attack, like we always do. 
Believing that everything is gonna be ok 'like always' is childish. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:46:59
Ok, you want to buy Bitcoin but you don't know the market. 
So there are only two options:
1. You want to buy Bitcoin because you believe in the project, tech and vision. Then you should buy using dollar cost average to protect you from volatility and hodl for the long term. 
2. You want to buy Bitcoin to make easy and fast money. Then trying to make money in a market you don't understand doesn't sound like a good idea, right? If this is the case, take your time to study how the Bitcoin market works before trying to speculate here.
In either case, do not invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:07:23
Happy hodling, and remember: do not panic sell. You will see ups and downs, if you panic sell at the downs, you'll need to rebuy when it's up again, loosing money in the process. 
Some people try to time the market, to sell high, buy low, however, doing such movements is risky. Another more conservative option is to buy in batches and hodl. And have some money ready to buy during dips. Over time, this is the best strategy in regards to risk reward ratio. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:32:25
Because bitcoins are generated as a reward to miners, but the reward is decreased over time, until it reaches 0, so at 10 minutes per block but with less bitcoins generated at each block, this means that it will take longer to mine all them. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:19:42
I'm gonna upvote all of them.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:56:44
Maybe not so idiot. Depending on the KYC/AML legislation this machine stores fiscal information from the users of the machine. 
Aside from that, this machine is interesting to cybercriminals to study how to tamper it to scam its users to buy Bitcoin but to a different address or nasty things like that. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:04:32
I'm not from USA, not sure what a space heater is, sorry. If you mean a random heater not using compression to move heat around, but generating heat from energy, then yes, mining is better. Since you invest same energy, you receive same heat plus bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:05:37
Of course they are a scam. Bitcoins are generated through mining, which requires professional equipment and lots of energy. If you don't want to mine your own bitcoins (because it's a big and complicated investment) the only option is to buy bitcoins from someone else.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:59:58
You can buy bitcoins in person using localbitcoins.

Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme because the point of Bitcoin, it's objective, it's not to be an investment vehicle, but to provide a distributed, decentralized banking system 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:49:01
It depends. If you use a heat pump it will be way cheaper than the Bitcoin miner, since the heat pump do not generate heat using energy, it uses energy to move heat from the outside to the inside.

bitcoin was never conceived to be immune to government interference because its impossible to be immune to government interference.
Bitcoin was designed to be resilient against restrictions imposed by governments and regulations. However, the centralization on exchanges is not resilient at all. Central exchanges are very vulnerable to regulators because those are traditional companies operating with fiat currency under a specific legislation.

You are mixing two different things. 
One thing is to be a trader and other thing is to be an investor. An investor tries to predict whats going to happen with a specific tech in a specific market and decides if its worth to put money into it. For example, if you believe solar energy is going to be the next big thing you may want to invest into some solar tech companies.
However, in order to know whats going to be the next big thing you need to know lots of things, including the tech itself. Because there could be a great opportunity, but the tech is not mature enough, or you could be thinking of great use cases that are simply not possible with the current tech. 
Being a trader is a very different thing. Depending on your trading strategy you don't even need to understand anything aside from the graphs and the trends.
