Or never lived. This is the nature of humans and their relationship with power.

At&amp;amp;t and dish want to merge. I'm not feeling good about that in context of comcast twc merger but this throws an interesting wrench in the machine.
If dish and AT&amp;amp;T merge and support bitcoin...?
EDIT: sorry not dish merger. Its direct tv. Fuck em

You have to separate your arguments out more precisely. Your thinking is sloppy here. 
The premise of anarcho communism is that you build a voluntary society in which people contribute to the common good without coercion. Under an ancom worldview taxes are a tool of bougie government to repress the proles.  You can argue that is not realistically going to happen but that's a very different argument and really has nothing to do with the bitcoin+socialism debate.

In case you didn't realize, I was agreeing with you.

I believe in bitcoin as a technology but the apparent financial ignorance in this sub highlights why people have trouble taking bitcoin seriously. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:39:37
I don't think it's about bitcoin. It's obviously not about bitcoin. People who assume it is are being stupid. That's my point. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:25:51
The fact that this was your interpretation shows a massive financial illiteracy. Like what are you, a teenager? The subtext is obviously dealing with th banking crisis. Are you too young to remember what that was? 
@_date: 2016-09-13 15:23:12
Uh because it would be fucking cool? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:56:42
.... And?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:55:46
This is too many levels of irony for me.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:44:23
I mean there's nothing inherently anti socialist about bitcoin at least no more so than fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:55:16
You are so incredibly self deluded.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:24:57
Hahaha lol man you think quoting a meme from a TV show means something. Good lord you are a tool.
Hey smart guy, if you didn't actually think about me at all, you wouldn't even reply. That's the difference between "aping something you saw on TV as a way to cover up insecurity" and "actually not caring".
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:43:30
Triggered much?
@_date: 2011-10-22 01:26:26
Why no dwolla? I tried it and its super easy. 
@_date: 2011-08-25 06:33:32
Yeah I mean I know thats true. I know it sounds bad, but thats not my intention. 
@_date: 2011-10-24 19:32:49
Yeah, thats the only thing I use it for. 
@_date: 2011-10-24 18:29:43
Whenever a new currency is introduced its always unstable because of the reason you mentioned. Merchants won't use until the price becomes stable, but it won't become stable until merchants use. Thats why most of the time, when a new currency is introduced, the only way it is stabilized is through government force. 
However, I'm pretty much okay with an unstable market. Merchants like Silk Road automatically adjust for the price changes and it functions fine as long as you pay attention.

The store is down right now, but once its back up, I will probably be up for it. Thanks fireduck
@_date: 2011-11-25 20:00:17
I checked that, and I have noticed that my blockchain was not up to date. I'm letting it catch up. 
@_date: 2011-08-25 06:28:29
I was looking at that last night. Will do more research. c
@_date: 2011-08-25 06:31:21
Yah, a little worried about that. I was looking at MTgox but I admit I was having some trouble getting it to work, even reading through their wiki. Maybe I'll give it another try. 
@_date: 2011-08-25 06:30:38
Hmmmm... Do you know if the person is legit at all? Do they have a bigger website for contact?
@_date: 2011-11-25 21:53:58
Hey everyone PROBLEM SOLVED. 
I just had to wait for the blockchain to update. Thanks. I thought it had done it overnight but I double checked and it's fine. 
@_date: 2011-11-25 20:39:17
Cool. I should probably update. Thanks. 
@_date: 2011-09-02 00:30:07
Alrighty, I just posted my google checkout. Excited to see how it goes. Thanks!
@_date: 2011-08-25 06:28:11
@_date: 2011-08-25 06:29:56
Yeah, that's a little steep. I read about the problems with Paypal so its understandable people would be wary. Thanks. I was looking at OTC and was a little hesitant but this seems like my best bet. Thanks
@_date: 2011-08-26 21:07:55
Okay, that sounds like a good idea. Thanks
@_date: 2011-08-26 21:08:31
Good advice. Thanks. I don't have a wells fargo or chase account but I am looking at getting a new checking account for ATM reasons. Thanks
@_date: 2011-10-22 16:58:16
Oooh. Alright, thats pretty rough. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-10-03 07:36:02
Great, so Amazon will start carrying drugs right? :D
@_date: 2013-10-03 07:32:59
You seem like a smart guy who knows his stuff, and it seems whatever asshole you were talking to was an idiot. You handled yourself with grace there man. Good on you. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:21:20
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-03 07:59:51
On what service. It's unaffected on Gox. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:05:56
Oh dang. I've been out of the loop for awhile. 
What would you suggest as a way to withdraw fiat money? could I convert it back into bitcoin and transfer it somewhere else to then withdraw it from? What other exchanges are still up? I was going to use bitinstant but apparently that's down now right?
Also I'm American btw
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:39:10
Nice! That's a decent profit. That's one of the things I've liked about btc is it's started helping me understand investing etc better, while also being a relatively simple limited focus market place. Also it's just kind of fun!
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:10:35
Ah. good to know. I kind of wish I'd been able to catch in on that dive, but it's good to hear that btc is remaining so stable. I think it's because the knowledge gate required to invest is a little higher so you have more people who know what they're doing and won't panic. 
A year or two ago I bought some btc. Then I got a frantic message from a friend telling me I needed to sell, the market was crashing from it's high. It had crashed from 200 to 120. I had bought those coins at 8 bucks a piece. I ended up making 500 bucks of it by accident! Been waiting for another low before I reinvest but so far the market has stabilized a lot more than it did in the early days.
