Check the actual amount of bitcoin you have, Ana then check how much your bank account was charged. It’s possible you bought less than you thought.

24 hour trading volume is very low on GDAX, what’s driving the price?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:28:47
Use a piece I plastic instead of wiring from your bank.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:40:04
It is only instant if you pay with a piece of plastic.
If you wire money it will take at least 7 days to arrive to coinbase.

I guess I’m only concerned with USD because I’m American. I assumed OC is as well.

I believe Coinbase is experiencing problems. Check GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:22:48
I think Coinbase just crashed, probably because a bunch of people are trying to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:37:39
Why are people spreading FUD right now? I just spent 2 hours not checking and prices have risen since then. We can't treat bitcoin like a financial instrument and then expect it to behave like something else. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:22:10
I think you are way too suspect of coinbase. You can’t come over to a totally decentralized currency and then assume its proprietors are behaving the same as those of a centralized currency. What’s the point of buying bitcoin if you approach it like this?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:25:35
Looking at this guy’s post history, I am near certain he has no bitcoin, has never had bitcoin, and is simply commenting to fuck people over. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:28:10
I’m not going to accuse you of being a scammer, but I will tell you there is no chance anyone who actually owns bitcoin who will partner with you. The only people stupid enough to do that on this subreddit don’t actually hold any coin, they just think they possess valuable opinions.

Sorry if that came off as sarcasm. No offense taken. I’m just here to hodl. Bought $100 more today. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:00:58
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:11:21
I bought $50 more. That makes a total of $150 for this dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:27:06
I'm not asking if they are the same, I already know that. GDAX and Coinbase consistently quote different valuations, and I'm wondering which one is more accurate.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:59:19
Correct. Transfers are immediate.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:42:14
Anyone else having the problem in which Coinbase says purchases are disabled?

Coinbase is insured by the FDIC. Customers are protected from any financial turmoil not caused by natural market behavior.

I want to help you, but your post script makes me want to get you banned because your opinion differs from mine. If you're not mining it doesn't matter what computer you purchase. Ledger Nano S is very reliable cold storage, but that's simply what I've seen from people on this sub. I have no idea why you think you need to connect to a proxy server while working with bitcoin, so I cannot give a recommendation. TOR is a browser which allows users to connect to proxies which have access to the "Dark Web." I like Coinbase, although I've only held coin for a few months, but I've also not had any problems.

Higher fee means faster transaction. If you don’t mind waiting, pay as little as possible.

You can upload images of your personal identification l, it does not need to be captured from your computer.

This would turn bitcoin into the ultimate fiat, based on the total volume of coin in circulation. I don’t think many people who hold bitcoin would want that.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:43:21
In order to transfer your coin, miners charge fees, and when there are many transactions to be completed, miners charge higher fees to those willing to pay more and get transactions through faster. One doesn’t have to pay a high transaction fee, but the more one pays, the faster a miner will complete the transaction.

Should I pay attention to GDAX or Coinbase in order to evaluate my position if my Bitcoin is stored on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:26:48
If you want specific information for XLM, I advise you to ask this question in the discussion found in r/CryptoCurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:25:11
Calm. Down. Valuations dropped this much 2 days ago, and  it’s all fine. Look back to the yearlong returns, remind yourself of bitcoin’s resiliency.

Actually I don’t think the purchase went through on coinbase :). It says the transaction completed but then my account reflects no new coin :))))))).
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:50
Yeah I bought more.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:09:09
Probably not. Hodling negatively affects the brain.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:31:05
You may lose money on this gift. Your gift of $100 will be a specific quantity of bitcoin, whose value is totally variable, but that amount of bitcoin will always be the same. The market value of one bitcoin will dictate the value of the amount of bitcoin you possess, a percentage of one bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:39:08
 I’m advising you to buy right now. No one on this subreddit is doing anything more than speculating, but analysis of the current trading volume of bitcoin trading suggests that the current stall on price is simply a low quantity of buying/selling. Once those quantities pick up, likely after the holiday, the price will likely fluctuate, hopefully in an upwards trend.

Everyone here has already observed that newbs are fleeing. Therefore the veterans who know NOT to buy BTRASH aren’t buying. Why would the exchange for BTRASH crash if there is no demand?

So what’s the best way to get in?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:36
I’m in. I’m ready to get my heart broken.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:14:33
I've made my investment with money that I don't need, so I have no plans to sell any time soon. I'm simply going to watch the exchange. I only bought in for 300 anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:42:44
Why would you sell you fool. If you haven’t sold already, you’re too late. It’s time to hodl. You can’t take losses if you don’t convertZ
