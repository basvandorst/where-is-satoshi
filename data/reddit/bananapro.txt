This is why buttcoin makes fun of this subreddit. Posts like this. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 13:45:33
I'm looking at the sub and the response is actually kind of positive. I'm very pleased. Usually there is extreme hate when bitcoin is mentioned on any other subreddit.

Apple will never accept bitcoin you idiot. Why make this post? How can people be so stupid they upvote this shit? 
Don't you understand that everything about bitcoin is completely contrary to apple's entire philosophy? Apple is about control, about centralization. Bitcoin is the opposite of everything apple likes.

They can, nothing is stopping them. Government has a lot of money. Really the only reason they haven't done it is because bitcoin isn't a real threat or problem yet. By the time they decide it is, you better hope that difficulty is WAY wayyy wayyyy up.

Making it easier to accept bitcoin is literally evil.

Well, in my post I said that I don't really mind real criticism or even mocking stupid shit says. I just often notice there's a lot of real anger, and not just on It's on twitter, youtube, news sites. In fact I don't think I've seen calm anti-bitcoin comments outside of reddit.

You're being far too lenient. They are atrocious. I literally want nothing to do with bitcoin anymore knowing that's the type of commericals the general public will see. They are not interest in this shit, they didn't even make point of any benifits bitcoin actually has.

Most normal people don't care about the internet, they care about facebook. People don't care about how internal combustion works - they want to drive to a party. People don't care about bitcoin, they want to pay for stuff fast, securely, and with low fees. Well fuck, they can do that right now. Bitcoin doesn't give much to the average person. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:44:37


This sentence doesn't even make sense. 


Victims of scams and gox are indeed victims, but again that has nothing to do with bitcoin. There are thousands of scams operating with USD and people fall for them all the time. 


Fuck you strawman!

I usually see "low fees" listed as a benefit for bitcoin - which is indeed true they are very low. Indeed, when people say "no fees" it's dishonest. The question gets a little bit more complicated than this though. You can actually try to send a transaction without paying any fee and it may work.. sometimes.

I think there's a lot of good, informative comments in this thread and only a few cult-like ones. I think people really overstate that it's "frighting" or something. I don't find that to be the case at all. I don't mind if you don't want to invest, it's a super risky investment. I don't think your financial decisions should be based on a reddit community's behavior though. It should be based on facts, your own research, your own reasoning, etc.

I think it's pretty important, people like to have digital goods. They know that digital stuff is good: they can get movies and music and news, etc. digitally. We don't call mp3's "virtual music" and we don't call movies "virtual film". If someone asked if you want to watch a virtual film you'd be like "wtf is that?". Virtual has a different connotation. It doesn't sound right. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 21:31:51
The wallet metaphor itself does more harm than good because it's so flawed. Really there is just a private key and a public key. The public key is like your wireless "wallet" that people can put money into at any time. The private key is the "key" to that wallet that lets you open it and spend money from it.

I don't consider an aptitude for art as a "type of intelligence". I think art is quite excellent and serves an important purpose in our society, but it simply isn't intelligence because that's just an attempt to destroy the meaning of the word. It's makes it meaningless. I've seen a guy on TV puke all over a canvas and sell his "artwork" for tons of money. Doesn't mean he's intelligence (although he could be, it's a separate question).

Nice username. I always wanted to ask one of you buttcoiners why you expend the effort to actually create an anti-bitcoin account on reddit, then instead of sticking to actually roam around trolling There are many things I don't like, many things that even upset me. I don't go to their subreddit and waste my time there though. I also don't create subreddits against a certain thing I happen to not like. Why are buttcoiners so different and feel this need to do all this stuff about it?

People don't care about PayPal, credit cards, the internet, internal combustion engines, etc. People use all these wonderful things because they have useful applications in their lives. They can pay for clothes, chat on Facebook, drive to the supermarket. Same thing with bitcoin. People eventually will be using it without knowing they're using it.

I don't so much trust coinbase as much as they're one of the only ways to buy coins easily right now for me.

I don't think it makes sense to think about fees or friction because they will never even consider the idea. Apple is a company primarily concerned with making the absolute most "comsumer friendly" non-controversial, grandmother proof, "college gurls" devices possible.

People lost money quite a bit because the early internet was such an efficient way to spread around scams and BS.

How is someone making a bad investment decision a victim? When you invest in something is there some kind of promise or guarantee that you will make money? No. 
That said, many people make lots of money with bitcoin this year. They shorted it when it went down and went long when it was going up.

1. I didn't know that processors like bitpay takes unconfirmed transactions. Makes sense. 
2. Gotcha.
3. Still a bit concerned. If someone like amazon decides to take bitcoin then who knows what will happen. 5x capacity might come sooner than expected. 
4. This bothers me quite a bit still. I don't know how it would be even possible to fix it though.

Bitcoin doesn't scale well for various reasons actually, but one reason just as an example: 
If bitcoin does get incredibly popular the blockchain will become very huge very fast. Most normal people will not be able to store it. So there will be a few massive corporation that can mine and be nodes, normal people will no longer be able to do this though.

My point is that apple will NEVER accept bitcoin. They are the ultimate control, walled garden company. You aren't allowed to do anything to their phones unless you hack it through some vulnerability. They LOVE centralized, they HATE decentralized.

When you load up money and give it to paypal, paypal has your money. Some people don't like that. I like having my money that I worked hard for. 
Some other important differences:
Bitcoin's cryptography cannot be broken by any realistic computer systems. It's perfectly secure, I have no idea what is going on with paypal's servers. I know nothing about that.
Bitcoin isn't controlled by any company, so no one can tell your when you're allowed or not allowed to spend your bitcoins. Paypal send me an email saying they want my driver's license and utility bills or they'll prevent me from using their service. What the fuck?
Unlike the US dollar, which isn't backed by anything at all - bitcoin is backed by the most powerful decentralized computer network in the world which is constantly getting larger and more secure. 
Bitcoin is deflationary currency. There's a limited amount of coins so storing coins as a store of value is a much better idea than storing dollars which are losing value rapidly. 
There's probably many other things that I have forgotten, but these are some things. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:26:30
