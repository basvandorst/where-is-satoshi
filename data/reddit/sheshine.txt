Moreover, last week was full of excellent news for Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:55:44
I think what they need to do is make a ton of Coinbase ATMs and a bunch of BitPay ATMs.  A long time ago people only used checks and cash.  Along came debit cards and credit cards.  Many people loved credit cards but many stayed clear.  One way the banks won people over was to have ATM machines and debit cards.  Banks said just get your cash from a machine near your house using this card and it will be easier than getting cash from here every time.  Then once a person had the debit card and they realized that shops would take it, they started using it instead of cash.  ATMs were a huge factor in people switching over from cash/checks to debit/credit cards.  I think the same will be for bitcoin.  We need those ATMs on the ground everywhere.  Then all the stores will accept bitcoin and then there won't be a need for the ATMs.  It is kind of hard to grasp, but I am sure this is an important step.  
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:34:43
Phrasing!
