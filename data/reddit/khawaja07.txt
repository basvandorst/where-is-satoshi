Idk maybe use some less known forum for it? Maybe there you got a chance. Referral links are mostly not allowed.

Thanks guys, i used STeamgamesBTC for my $100 steam wallet card order. Had 165 Stellar Lumans for years now. Converted them into $126 worth of bitcoins and got this baby :D

If i were you i'd directly call them via phone to resolve this situation, just by accessing poloniex from different browsers doesn't warrant them freezing your account. This is a serious matter so yea i would suggest talking to them via a phone call.

Excellent Idea!, although it would've been nice if you'd add info about some of the bitcoin regulatory authorities in some 1st world countries who want to regulate the flow of bitcoin an such.

downloading a piece  of software and running it on your PC for only .23 cents is quite unbalanced.

Edit: Also, we is it saying Beep Boop Beep Boop, these are not the bitts you are looking for error? iam trying to post an article from the NY times?

" To receive payment on your Bitcoin-wallet it is necessary:
    - Purchase any volume of powers available
Also this
"If you do not purchase additional powers within 30 days of creating your new account, your free powers will be deactivated automatically.
Your free powers will be activated automatically after any additional powers purchasing"

Its ironic you saying that when a guy like trump wins the General Election in the 'greatest democracy in the world' by a good margin. It proves that people who aren't from South-Asia can be 'brainwashed' quite easily. The NSA, State media spreads as much negative propaganda as it can.. the unstable nuclear state one is particularly hilarious..

Predictable and disgusting comments as usual from people who never stepped even a foot in Pakistan even once.. and i thought this sub-reddit consisted of much more mature discussions about the Cryptocurrency. Silly me. Following the paid and click-bait western media coverage of Pakistan won't get you anywhere :)
@_date: 2016-09-07 22:50:58
For me they did :(

The countries were there are majority of Muslims outside of the Arab states are 3rd world countries and there mining and bitcoin are not popular at all, also bitcoin is banned in some of those already so don't get your hopes up outside of the Arab States.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:16:05
You mean to say the Arab states... don't set such a monotone way of saying stuff like that..it seems really ignorant at times..
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:26:50
Umm are you serious with this question mate? IF by chance you are serious somehow then a resounding YES. Its the 2nd most spread religion after Christianity mate.
