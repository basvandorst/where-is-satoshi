I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USAand your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Mycelium has the same "problem" truecrypt had before they imploded (still has, to a degree).
Neither program is perfect, but they're both still the best at what they do. You can criticize either all you want, but unless you're offering something better, it's not going to mean much.
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:36:03
The most basic problem end the end was its weird development model. When the TC devs closed down shop and abandoned it, no one else was ready to take over. To this day no one is really sure why they did it. Their stated reasoning ("Windows has encryption now") struck a lot of people as intentionally obtuse. The running conspiracy theory is that they were targeted by a vague yet menacing government agency and chose to self-destruct instead of being forced to add something like a backdoor.
*Before the implosion,* TC's problem was that no one had actually independently audited it. There wasn't and still isn't any proof that TC was ever really safe as vetted by crypto experts. This is certainly not a problem with bitcoin at large, but it does apply to specific wallet implementations.
I do not think this is likely to happen to bitcoin, and even if it did, there are a hundred altcoins ready to take over.

It's not automatic like mining difficulty, it's decided by the community. As a practical matter, most parties set the fee somewhere above the technical minimum in the current version of Bitcoin-QT (currently 100μ฿ or .0001฿).
If the price continues to rise, or stabilizes, expect the client developers to lower the minimum fee requirements. The idea is to keep transaction fees nominal and affordable.

My guess is that OP's private key got added to someone's wallet, and whoever owned that wallet swept 500BTC to a cold storage address.

You're totally right, this shit is the wild west, and people are bound to get fucked. That's how most of the world works.

The complexity? It would be a matter of days before someone made and distributed an automated double spend attack tool. Closing a transaction at zero confirmations is a lot riskier than you're making it out to be.

So this theoretical Quantum computer can crack the private key from the public key, but can't crack the public key from the hash? I don't get it
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:54:18
I'm hoping we see  a big correction so I can buy in.

What functionality? They're just fancy handles for Gillette carts.
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:47:47
Not into the whole brevity thing?

Where do I sign up for that, it sounds like a good gig.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:58:41
Seriously. Is *this* why my orders aren't going through?
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:53:19
It's because its fungible and widely accepted.

I dealt with a mining pool that counted in floating point, that was a real pain in the ass.

All these problems were solved weeks ago. [Some of] the new clients run a lightweight pruned version of the blockchain.
(edit for accuracy)

What fee did you pay?
A lot of people are moving to .0005 or .0001 because of the exchange rate, but many clients are still paying .001, so priority issues are at play.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:58:29
Damn. Just as bitcoin was starting to stabilize
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:00:18
Roughy twice as much 'this' when charted.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:25:42
Don't do that.

I imagine a 100k XBT buy would be pretty intense in person.
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:34:14
That's definitely a gif.

USAA is solid. I don't know why anyone eligible wouldn't bank with them.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:14:13
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:49:37
That's a step better than BoA, who will definitely fuck you.
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:20:37
Heh. I trust they are cheaper than the first BTC pizza.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:30:02
For a farce, it's pretty useful.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:38:21
This. So much this.
@_date: 2013-03-05 05:20:03
Wouldn't /dev/random suffice for that?
