You know what, I'm gonna steer off topic for a bit. What exactly is wrong about the Colombian stereotype abroad? If I remember correctly we were ALL indirectly involved in the cocaine business in one way or another back in the 80's and 90's. How old are you? Maybe too young to remember how it dictated every day life, the cops were in it, the priest took a cut, the stock market fluctuated every time a shipment got caught, almost every single sports team was funded by it etc etc. It was the prime driving force in our economy. Guess what, the stereotype is the price we pay for reaping away at the benefits of the drug trade for decades.  Shit, at least is better than the hypersensitive entitled prick stereotype people like you are spreading around the world, I'm already getting a bit embarrassed for people as they try to tip-toe around Colombia and it's history because of little shits throwing a hissy-fit any time someone says cocaine. Even Uribe and his illustrious father have been thoroughly linked to the cocaine trade so lets not sit on a high horse and pretend it doesn't have a stomach full of cocaine. /rant

Good. We built our country upon the corpses of hundredths of thousands, all victims of the drug trade. Even our previous president funded his own private paramilitary death squads with it. So we fucking deserve this mark, because if we were not part of it, we allowed it. Which is just as bad.

If by insensitive you mean us Colombians priding our selves as one of the happiest nations in the world while suffering the highest rate of Hunger in South America and simultaneously displacing millions of innocent civilians in a conflict that makes Palestine look like a Kindergarten fire drill, then yes. We Colombians are sickeningly insensitive.
