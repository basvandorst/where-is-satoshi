Is this a joke? 
Bitcoin is branded as a solution to corruption thanks to the public ledger blockchain...yet thousands and thousands of Bitcoins have been lost at Gox and nobody knows where they went. 
Neo &amp; Bee was celebrated as the new modern Bitcoin bank and a great solution to the people of Cyprus...and then the owner ran off with the money. 
There's no sensationalization required, Bitcoin is an unregulated financial market filled with greedy scumbag libertarians happy to take money from equally greedy people who think they are part of some worldwide financial revolution

You're trashing him for posting realistic sales figures and portraying a realistic impression of Bitcoin sales short and long-term? 
This really is a bitter, pathetic, insulated cult of a community.

They weren't dropped, they haven't been tried yet. That trial is upcoming. 
Also, it doesn't really matter that both the hitman and victim were both undercover cops. Soliciting a murder is still illegal, even if you are stupid enough to ask a cop to kill another cop

So, first you call someone a troll, then claim to be trolling yourself, then claim to be enjoying the people who have been laughing at bitcoin's declining value and pathetic adoption rate for the past year?

Not to mention practically every retailer that accepts BTC is dead-silent about sales figures because we all know those fall into the trash maybe two weeks after the initial rush. 
The same decline applies to the bitcoin subreddit traffic stats, see for yourself.

No, it isn't
People aren't going to suddenly wake up one day and realize they *need* Bitcoins


x isn't impossible therefore y is likely...why does that make sense to you? The downward trend could "break" with years of sideways price movement, there's no reason it's going to explode all of a sudden. 


You are totally delusional

If you paid attention to the bitcoinmarkets subreddit during early 2014 they paid attention to this "bubble cycle" you're kidding yourself about. By June the cycle was off and now we're sitting on a year of losses and downward action...and you're still talking as if there's another bubble right around the corner? 
You're absolutely kidding yourself here buddy. History doesn't mean shit, we're already months and months past what history would show as time for another bubble, and there's been worldwide declining interest in bitcoins despite everybody already essentially knowing they exist. There won't be another substantial bubble maybe ever, certainly not three simply because these digital coins nobody cares about have become more rare to the people that do care about them. 
I urge you to read through some of the Daily Discussion threads from the bitcoinmarkets subreddit from early 2014. You'll see your theory of historical-cycled bubbles holds no water
here's a random day to serve as an example for you
and here's about a month later (and way off track for the supposed bubble)
