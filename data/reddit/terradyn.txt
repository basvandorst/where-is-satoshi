Just give him a paper wallet then.

[19BY2XCgbDe6WtTVbTyzM9eR3LYr6VitWK]( is the address they're using for the "auction". There are some small amounts thrown in already although they may have been tests by the actors involved.

Interesting. Just read this thread that details the issue:
Thanks for the insight. Guess a good way of detecting real full nodes has to be created first.

Merry Christmas! Might be my first ChangeTip!

This is how you turn a movement into a revolution. Spreading the wealth to the selfless spokesmen of our generation. True trickle down economics.

How could you create a fake full node? By definition, wouldn't they be contributing to the network decentralization?

There is a private key for every public key address that can store bitcoins.

There is zero reason for someone to stock up if the price in fiat is the same as BTC. Why go through the trouble? The only reason would be if a vendor passes on the savings they achieve to the consumer which they have no incentive to do at the moment over just expanding their customer base to include people that already have BTC for one reason or another.

I see that for tech savvy people that understand how to secure a wallet effectively (a small population), but when you're talking about the masses, it is less secure to use bitcoin over having the banks insure their savings. If you take the position that third parties will come in to help add security, then you've already invalidated the privacy aspect as well.

But that's exactly the point. If i'm going to use coinbase, I've already given up the privacy aspect of my identity to them. The second part is if it takes no effort for me to stay in fiat and pay for an item at some retailer, why would I go through the trouble to converting to bitcoin, and having to add 2FA and other means of security when I can just use my credit card and know that even if it's stolen, etc. I have a guaranteed method of recovery (the banks take the hit) versus the chance that my coinbase acct gets hacked, etc. and I have no guarantees from coinbase that they will refund my money.

Awesome idea!

Right on!

I want to see them all face away from him and jump randomly when they "feel" his force. That would be hilarious.

If you're new at this, just keep it on Coinbase. You're more likely to have a virus/keylogger that takes your bitcoin if it's on a computer and not a hardware wallet.

The OP mentioned that the claimants in the bankruptcy had agreed to take ~$450/btc.

1) Extremist big blockers think Segwit changes the economic incentives around bitcoin to stagnate on-chain transactions and will cause people to stick to centralized lightning hubs that can be affected by 3rd parties via centralization at the hub level.
2) Extremist small blockers oppose BU because the development team is not strong enough presently to create a stable platform. Their bigger concern is related to EC which they feel puts too much power in the hands of the miners (and in particular the centralization due to the Bitmain collective and the ASICMiner vulnerability). They also fundamentally believe that miners should not have the final say in what is Bitcoin.
3) The extremists on both sides are stubborn and have dug in on their positions. They both feel that the other side will lead to centralization and the death of bitcoin which is why there is an impasse.
My opinion is that the problem bitcoin solves was difficult for a reason and you cannot take an absolutist prospective because there is no perfect solution and if we want Bitcoin to grow, we have to compromise on both ends. As the saying goes, "perfect is the enemy of good."

Voting manipulation would still be a problem. i.e. someone paying off or forcing a person to vote one way or the other. They can check the users key to verify they voted a particular way.
