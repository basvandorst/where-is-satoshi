I still dont see the appeal. Looking at bitcoin, choosing SegWit over a blocksize limit increase must have been a tough decision. It was the right decision, in so far it can be released. But its getting there. Go to ethereum, they cant make decisions. This is why they bailed out the dao. I dont know how to describe it. But that was a bad decision it seems. dao itself also seemed like a bad idea from the beginning. 


what do you mean? are you talking about bitcoin core? its no doubt complicated stuff. i assume geth etc. is the same?
What you are talking about, do not seem like things that will matter in the long run. PoS, difficulty bomb, and the programmability aspect. How does this distinguish blockchains in the long run, considering, presumably, all blockchains will be equally programmable in the end, if there is a demand.

A blockchain is not more valuable than its underlying consensus. Think of the consensus as a way to govern. Its not democracy. Its consensus. 
The consensus keeps track of, and decides who owns what. The consensus decides the rules. And its 100% digital, 100% open and 100% vuluntary. That is mindblowing, because its a new way of governing. Thats just 1 aspect.
With the blockchain, and actual digital property rights comes the ability to create a 100% digital monetary standard. The benefits of this is that it can potentially end a century of fiat enslavement, but this is where we start to veer off the matrix, and i can already sense the agents comming. I must go.

I am personally looking forward to the day when you can easy and simple convert your fiat balance to BTC via homebanking. I imagine having a balance of BTC and a balance of fiat. But i wonder if this is even legal? I dont think banks, because of legal tender laws, are allowed to adopt bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:18:46
Imo bitcoin is a long term thing. I think she could need that $500 dollars before the end of year? I think $1,000 cash/checking is not a bad idea. When you start having real savings, ie. you are covered for 6 months rent or more, then you can start considering things such as bitcoin. Just my 50 cents.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:34:37
@_date: 2016-08-12 22:09:38
Negative interest is just anti-saving in fiat. Its not neccesarily pro bitcoin. However, people are starting to see the dark clouds on the horizon, and they may come to gold, bitcoin rather than stocks.
@_date: 2016-08-20 21:05:14
I honestly dont know, but that shouldnt stop me from posting, right?  haha.
I think there is a level of flexibility among miners. They decide which transactions to specifically include. Some miners may have a policy of picking up oldest transactions, where as others, only pick up highest fee ones. And so on. This would explain why some transactions get the first confirmation after a few blocks, even tho blocks are full.
@_date: 2016-08-20 10:25:19
I think the government have a weak case if they want to decrease privacy. Transactions on the blockchain is public, and i think people have a right to privacy, its a fundamental right. If the government wants to make your transaction history public, it will be destroyed in court.

You sound like Greg right now.
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:55:51
There is a difference between not being happy with something, and something working. The network works, and i have not had problems yet. Despite using it on a weekly basis, i cant even complain about the fees, they are worth it, and still cheaper than established payment methods. And with bitcoin, alot of people have tried before it, but you dont hear about that. Bitcoin is not the first, its the biggest, and dont tell me there is not a good reason for that.
@_date: 2016-08-13 15:45:54
I had some ideas that could maybe add a few hundred nodes long term. Please bear with me, because this is probably something you havent heard suggested before, and something you may think is completely ridicoulous. But i think its a neat idea, and its comming from someone who have been running a full node at home, but felt the experience lacking.
I will start by saying that node incentivitation is something i care about too. I spend alot of time thinking about how it can be improved. So far, what i got, is non-protocol level stuff. Which is a good thing imo. Ok ill stop teasing now :) But dont hate me, when i say this.
I imagine achivements in bitcoin core. For example, achivements for when having ran a node for 24H. An achivement if you had 8 incomming connections. If you proccesed 100 blocks, 1000 blocks and so on. Synced the full blockchain. Just something that make the experience of running a node a little more fun or rewarding. I think it matters. It may not appeal to all, but it does appeal to some, and that matters.
I was also hoping for a console view when running bitcoind. So that you get a liveview, with simple commands. This way the console view will tell you when a new block has been found. When difficulty has been adjusted, and so on. As an end user, getting this type of feedback will make it feel more rewarding to run a node. Again, it may not appeal to all, but it will appeal to some. I also imagine adding simpler commands. Such as "mempool". And console displays mempool size. But perhaps even better "fee", which returns the average fee of all transactions in the mempool. This will allow people with a full node to quickly understand how big their fee should be if they want priority transaction. These sort of thing, once you have developed the basic framework, should be trivial to improve upon. And its going to make Core have an edge, and appeal to a broader audience.

Not really. The people who want to hardfork for a 1mb blocksize limit increase, considering we are already getting such a capacity increase in the form of SegWit, via softfork, and, on top of that LN and Payment channels. Considering that, the group that wants to hardfork for 1mb blocksize limit increase are merely trying to be disruptive for no good reason. So, not understandable at all.

That war on the drugs makes no sense considering how it doesent change anything? The market for drugs is huge. Im wondering what went wrong. Who decided it would be a good idea to ban them? Its one of those things that sounds good in theory (not really, i think people are well within their rights if they can do drugs responsibly. Many people can, i think, when you look at how big the market is.) but the ban doesent work in practice. Why is it still in effect? In my opinion it shows that the government is not good enough. It is failing when it comes to making policies that benefit society as a whole - the war on drugs aint a benefit, all things considered.

Believe it or not but there is big demand to trade bitcoin and other crypto currencies because of the volatility.

for the experiment to be successful i felt they should have experimented with new denominations. there should have been a standard wallet, with a preconfigured denomination amount. for example, MIT's. Lets say a student will spend $5,000 on campus through a year i dont know maybe they spend more.. But let the denomination be 1:1. So if they got x amount of bitcoin, make the denomination resemble whatever they would use in actual dollars in a year. Understand?

They do not reduce the traditional risks associated with holding bitcoin. If THEIR servers get compromised and you end up loosing bitcoin, that is covered. If your account only gets compromised and you loose bitcoin, that is not covered&lt;-- and this is the primary way people loose bitcoin. So basically they are doing nothing different. And if their servers get compromised and the attacker is able to empty peoples accounts it is likely they will loose so much bitcoin they would have no choice but to go bankrupt. Meaning people wont get reimbursed anyway.

They wont let people play anonmously using bitcoin. Or maybe they will, if there is a legal loophole, but it would be closed if using bitcoin became a thing. If you want to play poker anonymously or gamble, you have to use the sites that are dedicated specifically to that. But that is just for a limitied time. If bitcoin becomes a thing, the same rules that apply to traditional money transfers and gambling etc. would apply to bitcoin transfers and gambling, dont you think?

0% fees and the insurance are marketing terms which is supposed to make the ordeal look good, but in the end the bitcoin will be more expensive compared to bitstamp or bitfinex, and the insurance will be nothing fancy(they will merely insure their cold and hot storage, not your account if you loose your password to a hacker etc.)

I dont know about the degree to which Asia is able to innovate. They are certainly hard workers and able to mass produce. But it seems that ideas and innovation stems primarily from EU and the US. Now. The cancer that is taking us strait to poverty in the west will eventually die, and prosperity will flow once again. But there will be a transitional period where we  get really sick. And depending on the degree to which Asia depends on the west, they will be impacted as well.

Unfortunately its not doing very good. The technical community behind bitcoin seems to be slowing down. The people who got us this far, are either leaving or focusing on other things. And it does not seem sufficient new talent is drawn in. This explains the relative stagnation of the exchange rate, and the focus on more or less questionable enterprises such as Circle. Anyway, i for one have not given up on bitcoin, and have a few projects of my own im focusing on.

Are you kidding me? The insurance they offer, for something which is not even available yet, is questionable at best. How much are they insured for? Is that enough to cover all clients deposits? Etc. 
Im not sure you are even aware. The insurance they mention is only if their servers get compromised and coin end up being stolen. If your account only gets compromised, that is, you loose your password to a hacker or something. Then there is no insurance. Its the excact same policy as everywhere else, and its a sensible one too

There is no demand from consumer masses to get into bitcoin. And when there is, they probably will use the least difficult service there is, and the one with the cheapest bitcoin. And im not sure Circle will be able to provide either hassle free purchases or cheap bitcoin.

All i know is i saw strong increases 2 times the last 2 days without a consequent correction. Thats a very strong signal to me. I still believe bitcoin will hit $2200 within the next 12 months, and i am personally selling all i got around that, unless of course it turns out the dollar will collapse or there is some serious econoimc shit happening, then i will keep, for then i think there is no going back.

No. Standards emerge because it is more economically effecient. basically you are saying everyone will use different equipment, materials etc. to make the road different for every mile which does not make sense.

What is a war debt? As far as i understand that is only possible to begin with because you can inflate the money afterwards. The people who loaned out the money dont care, they get the new money first and can spend them(get rid of them) before they trickle down the economy and make everything more expensive. So basically there will be no war debts in a sound bitcoin/money economy. Its not possible. The money would have to come directly from people, in the form of taxes, and before taxes reached the neccesary level,  people would revolt.

No one can truly ban anything:) Drugs, crime, etc. It cannot be banned, yet people think bans are good idea, our entire society revolves around the idea of banning things. But lets look into what a ban actually is. And its quite simple i think. A ban is a threat. If you do this, we are gonna hurt you. That is the fundamental idea of a ban. So if you do crime, which is banned, to put it simply..  Then we or society, or actually its the state that will hurt you. Hurt you by putting you in prison, rob you of your freedom. Treat you like a i dont even know what to call it. But putting people in prison is degrading, that is what the laws fundamentally rely on. A threat, based on prison, which is degrading. 
However, that does not stop people from doing whatever activity it has been decided should be banned. Some people are good at not getting caught, some take the risk, some dont feel like they have a choice and some actually dont have a choice. They do what is banned.

I actually think a bitcoin run is imminent. Or i mean. A bitcoin run could happen before the next rally. Bitcoin runs have happened before, although the exchange market was  different then.

i dont think you know what is meant by deposit insurance. If their servers are compromised and you somehow loose bitcoin, they will restock you, so to speak. However if they wind up storing millions of USD worth of bitcoin and their servers get compromised they will likely not be able to hold up to their promise and go bankrupt instead. And if your account only gets compromised, their insurance doesent cover that.
So basically they are doing what every other bitcoin wallet is doing, except they are also free. You see, you dont really need deposit insurance in bitcoin land since you can reduce the risks via technology alone. The technology and its implementation, for example multisig, *is* the insurance and many wallets are already starting to support it
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:10:34
Oh boy. You gotta be aware of the pitfalls. In my opinion no way of storing is better than the other as long as you are aware of the pitfalls and take the neccesary precations. With electrum you dont want the wallet.dat file to fall into the wrong hands, or delete it by mistake etc. Use backups, but make sure they dont fall into the wrong hands. If you encrypt it(its extra security, but you dont have to if you feel comfortable that no-one is snooping around in your computer. Etc. etc.  Read up on it

They would not be able to go after the companies, they would have to go after the end user. Stating something specifically like it is illegal to use an unregistrered adress. For if they went for the buisneses they would only really have jurisdiction on companies in US soil.

You dont need to provide sensitive information in order to purchase bitcoin, that is something the government thinks is neccesary. Exchanges are forced to require it. This is basically where things start to go wrong because it creates a grey market where people make mistakes and get involved with the wrong people. 
But thats not to say there isnt room for improvement. Bitcoin is considered difficult to get by many, thats why the price is low. If/when things improve, and bitcoin will be easier to get, the price will also reflect this.

@_date: 2016-10-09 09:46:55
Maybe you will pay the cost. If on-chain fees are $10 that means there is a better transaction system somewhere that is enabled by the on-chain fees. So you pay the $10 up front. Get your UTXO and coins, and then you maybe pay $10 again and then you are inside the cheaper and effecient transaction systems and can send and recieve coins from there.
IIrc in turkey they give newborns a gold coin. Its not that far out to believe you can inherit UTXO or be given it by your parents when you start out in life.
@_date: 2016-10-09 11:14:20
Bitcoin is just a blockchain that blockchains up to 1mb of data approximiately every 10 minutes.
Miners do have the ability to constrict the amount of data that is being blockchained per block. 
So what happens is we bid for blockspace. And the more of it there is, maybe the less we would be willing to bid and vice versa. So if miners shrunk the blocksize they could cause people who is looking for blockspace to pay more in a desperate attempt to get some.
@_date: 2016-10-09 11:36:40
sorry maybe someone else can chime in. im not excactly sure how to define blockspace. i think the best thing to do is pick a time where you have some time and read one of the many books on bitcoin. ive yet to do that myself, but i think its the most productive way to understand bitcoin i think. not sure if you have done that already tho.  have a nice day.
