I was thinking about it, but i want to travel with the car to turkey, italy, dennark etc, there are not many superchargers around yet, so i will drop tesla:)
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:37:39
I wanted to do that, but it was taking over my life, its extremely hard to control yourself, i wasnt sleeping much+ checking gdax every 1/5 min was annoying me!
Sad thing is i coulnt stop checking gdax every min.
Sorry for bad english, money comes and goes, have a blessed day MR:)

The last thing i will ever do on e-net is to spread lies, i just wanted people to know that bitcoins can make your dream come true.
I wrote it the way we say it btw, corrected post later.
No one will force you to believe in anything,  i just shared my story, to let people know that, the future is on the internet, have a blessed day:)
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:15:53
Runescape completely changed my life:)
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:45:10
Money comes and goes, once you make enough you should leave, look at all rich people out there, all day do is thinking about money, stressing, depressing, lifes to short for that ��❤️
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:56:52
I bought and sold at crash/dipps pumps.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:43:52

@_date: 2017-11-03 16:28:11
Thats correct:)
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:33:55
Hi again M4.
Yes 100% exit.
I could have made more by selling high/buying low, like ive always been doing, but it was taking over my life, siting infront of exchanges was geting very annoying, i was talking about btc to all my friends, some of them started to get mad at me for talking about it, btc seriusly started to take control of my life, so i woke up on monday and said enough is enough:)  i still have normal job geting paid 3750 usd, from now on i will live a normal life without thinking about money.
For all the lads with btc out there, if you want to make money, try to learn "buy/sell" and for the hodlers out there, dont worry i can promise that btc price will hit 20k usd one day, sorry for my bad english❤️
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:38:08
Thank you, best of luck to you also.
I was checking prices every 1/5 mins, life is to short to do that for months/years.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:52:35
Im so happy idk what im doing, i don't expect anyone to believe me, i shared my story and thanked the community.
Also i got all my bitcoins from selling runescape gold!
But i will post a pic with new reddit name in a few weeks:)
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:04:54

Cryptopay (best reviews). Check google.
Coinbase good exchange, but if something happens it might take 8 weeks til you get help.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:47:03
So if i place sell order for 2 btc, how long does it take to sell? Because someone said within 30 secs.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:26:30
