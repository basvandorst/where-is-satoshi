You can use the Public REST API [here]( and create a Google Script and paste this 
    function getBitcoinPriceFromGemini(){
        var url = '
        var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url,{'muteHttpExceptions' : true});
        var data = response.getContentText();
        var json = JSON.parse(data);
        var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
        sheet.getRange('A1').setValue(json.last);
    }    
Then set up a time Trigger for that function to run every 5 minutes.

It depends on the amount of money you want to fund. But I would say Interac-e Transfer the easiest but you need a minimum of $2,000. If you are lucky enough to have an older Interac Online card or have a bank that would give you one that is the best way to do it since it is instant.

This is the most paranoid shit I have seen on this sub if you play with unregulated decentralized fire you are going to get burned while you wait to warm yourself up and there won't be a fire department when the flames grow to quickly.

Any card with a Visa symbol is not Interac Online accessible. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:08:34
Sorry for the confusion. Visa debit cards. Any bank access card with visa on it is Interac e-Transfer accessible but not Interac Online accessible. QuadrigaCX doesn't take credit cards to my knowledge.

But wouldn't dropping to 3k make a lot of those regular joe's and jane's feel worried and turn them off from the currency (thus less adoption and less utility) since all they most likely see it as is a get rich quick security. Now that they lost big on Crypto they would either be stuck hodling because they don't want to realize their losses or they would sell at the bottom because psychologically they would have been hit with the biggest loss they would/might have experienced financially since 2008 recession.

I requested a 50sat/b transfer three days ago. It took three days but it still only cost me near nothing compared to how much I was moving.

Yep, also you have to look at the wholistic view of the Bank of Canada and the economy of Canada right now and the last 4-6 months.
Right now, the BoC are skeptical about everything: interest rates, housing markets/bubbles, employment/unemployment, debt to income ratios etc.. The purpose of the speech really was to show that the Bank feels uncertain about many financial factors in the economy right now and is trying to improve most of it, but the things that are more risky to the normal Canadian citizen are what makes his job more difficult when his whole purpose is to try and make sure that the gears of the Canadian economy run smoothly and risk free. As a result, he is "losing sleep".
Yes, cryptocurrencies are disruptive and some can argue that ripping out central banks would be great. But doing so overnight would also destroy countries, and at the end of the day people are what make a country and therefore destroying a country means destroying a people.
But that is just my two cents.

I would give you gold if I wasn't so broke. This is exactly what I am talking about. 
I feel as though a lot of the vocal minority wish to see Bitcoin strip away all centralized global economies overnight, rid themselves of social services that taxes and governments place on their citizens; the same economies that still keeps the heat and electricity flowing into their neighbours houses. They see themselves as torchbearers of justice rather than firebringers of destruction (and who is really to say which one they truly are).
Yes cyrptocurrency/blockchain/etc. are going to disrupt economies but I don't think it is the smartest idea to flip a table in hopes that you can eat a luxurious meal off the floor.

yep "-coin" is the new ".com" some company working on Blockchain technology right now in their infancy is going to be the winner when the dust settles, but it might not be Bitcoin.

So which part of the bubble chart do we feel we are at yet: I say we are at denial but you know that's just my two cents. We seem to be blaming other culprits rather than actually looking at the fundamental flaws of bitcoin at the present time and how we should try and fix those issues. But I guess that is just FUD.

Withdraw your coins from Coinbase to an actual wallet that you own then fund an account on QuadrigaCX with the coins in your wallet when you want to sell. Also, once you are on QuadrigaCX and verified, never touch Coinbase again. Sure, using your credit card to fund the account is nice but their fees will ride your ass harder than QuadrigaCX's will and having to wait a business day or two is nothing.

Man, what a dick move. Though that could look to the Credit Union like you are laundering money through them before sending it to Bitcoin and depending on frequency could look suspicious.

I think the issue both of you are having in this analogy is that you are looking at Bitcoin as either a share or a physical item, both relying on a centralized company.
It is technically neither it is a currency/store of value.
You should really be comparing it to USD or some other Fiat currency and look at how people trade on the ForEx rather than how people trade on the stock market. Then you can begin to see at least better similarities and improve your analogies.
In this respect USD is a currency "owned" by the Central Bank of the US. And Bitcoin is a currency "owned" by nodes and miners (at least the core network that facilitates Bitcoin is "owned" by the users of the peer-to-peer network and thus decentralized).
With this now in mind you should begin to look at currency exchanges and how people trade in those markets as well as begin to try and understand what effects occur in a market when "everyone" can technically be a producer and consumer of a global currency (something that hasn't really ever happened before in history unless you want to try and build some barter system analogy - which is probably an easier analogy for why BTC is so volatile and why many people can't sit on a simple price range for more than a week at a time). Sprinkle on the fact that it's a deflationary currency, market manipulation, FOMO, FUD etc etc. and you got yourself a much harder item to judge and analyze than just comparing it as equals to a stock or an iPhone.

A bitcoin is a promise of value backed by an authority (the authority is the blockchain and the peers who use the network). The trade of dollars to yen is exactly equivalent to trading dollars to bitcoin. Being that we are trading a currency for a currency they should act very similar to the foreign exchange market.
My Canadian dollars are valued at .77 dollars to United States Dollars. That valuation in this comparison is not "backed" by authority it is set by supply and demand for that currency. That valuation is set by traders purchasing CAD on the foreign exchange and these traders are only willing to buy Canadian dollars at a lower valuable than USD. This is equivalent to BTC being valued at $6000 USD but is far more volatile since the market has less barriers to entry than the forex.
I am also not saying it does act like fiat. I think because many people don't see Bitcoin as an actual currency the market doesn't actually trade it like fiat. But fundamentally it should act like a currency and thus in the long run the market should result in similarities to currency exchange markets not stock markets.

Couldn't you argue that being able to purchase Bitcoin assets within a tax sheltered vehicle such as a 401k is a benefit for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:04:58
You do know 60% of your tax dollar goes towards Social Security, Unemployment, and Medicare right? You okay with stealing tax dollars from crippled old unemployed people? If taxes are theft, and you are not paying into the system that you benefit from, then it is you who is the thief that is leaching off of the other 99.99% that do pay taxes. Quite literally you are stealing from every other American citizen by evading taxes.

But some online shopping website that nobody actually uses says they want to implement lightning. How dare you make this FUD /s
But seriously this is honestly one of the reasons I never see Bitcoin being used as a currency universally in my lifetime. Because of its deflationary nature people are going to realize that pinning the value of a transaction to something like this won't work. If until all Bitcoins are mined and the scarcity is 100% then the value will always increase and people making actual transactions (not just trading coins for coins) will have buyers remorse forever.

Last upward resistance was from the 17th to 22nd at 7300. Seeing as RSI14 struck 77 as of the 24th we are going to see downward trends until RSI14 goes to 30 (which is basically what this market likes to do since people love huge overbuying and overselling swings on this market). As a result of this downward trend we will see downward resistance at 7300 again. If that resistance breaks we will shoot to the last highest  horizontal movement which is roughly 6500-6700 which occurred during the 2nd to the 10th. If that resistance breaks before RSI14 hits 30 then we will most likely see a drop to the next line of resistance which is 6200-6300 which occurred between the 10th and 16th. But by that point we will most likely be in a heavily oversold market and people will begin selling at higher prices again. Also this won't be overnight but will most likely take a week or two to test 7300.
