Not everyone lives in a monolithic country where all transactions are performed in a single currency. There's more to the world than North America...
However, I think the way Coinbase are angling is just to make BTC an optional payroll output. It's not uncommon for people to elect to have their pay split amongst different accounts (e.g., child support payments) by payroll. This is just like that. The fact it ends up as BTC is of no real interest to the employer.
My comment above was about companies who transact in BTC in both directions though.
Edit: Bitpay not Coinbase.

Linux Mint (desktop), Debian, Raspbian, Android for hot wallet.

yeah sorry, Bitpay.

You think stealing something that isn't government-issued currency is legal? Where's your car parked then?
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:29:37
Russia. And I imagine any country with employees who live across a border or the currency is volatile.

Sounds like you're PHP developer! TLDR is what I always get from PHP devs when supplying a spec or bug report.

AU$ too. In fact, why not support all the currencies supported on Blockchain?

Dell, come back when I can buy the same products in Australia as you sell in the US and Europe. Yes, I mean the Dell Sputnik.

Nah most cash registers support paid by &lt;method&gt; to support non-integrated credit card machines and the like. Shouldn't be hard to add this.

Big companies have a part of finance called Treasury that does exactly this. Ensuring there's enough money, in the right currencies, in the right accounts to make payroll and pay suppliers while also maximising returns on any cash on hand. They're used to hedging this stuff.
Smaller companies, well I guess you might decide to hedge your bets and have half in Bitcoin and half in fiat.

You need to read his investment philosophy. Purely speculative things like Bitcoin are completely outside his approach. It's not that he doesn't approve, just not what he does.

Why do they need my details to accept a Bitcoin donation? The main advantage of Bitcoin for donations is that I don't have to give my contact information. Charities have got incredibly aggressive about following up donations with requests for more and this is something I want to avoid.

Ordered a couple bottles. Let's see how Australia customs deals with then. 
You've got to meet a high bar though. Got to equal Byron Bay Chilli Co...

That's just pulled through from the Open Directory Project:
I would HOPE nobody using Bitcoin is stupid enough to install toolbars like Alexa's, so I'd take the stats with some salt...

And support getting money in from outside the US. This is why Mt Gox still wins. I can't get money to any other exchange from Australia without slow, expensive wire transfer. Make a call to Technocash and get them to do for your exchange what they're doing for Gox.

Nah we'll let any poms into Australia with two conditions:
They immediately start an IT recruitment company

weexchange.co seems pretty good. Process for getting signed up is straightforward and fast. Just needs more volume, so drop some BTC in and sell to me!

As determined by your democratically elected government. Not everywhere has Electoral Colleges and hanging chads. Some have quite effective democracies.

Is that a world championship where "World" refers to a newspaper that no longer exists rather than inviting the rest of the world?

Quite worthy but the charity he supports lists its core values as "**Christian Values**, Integrity, Resourcefulness, Stewardship, Transparency".

Satoshi Square in Sydney would be very good. How about lunch time one day each week. 
Perfect location is outside the Reserve Bank in Martin Place. Slow start up with first Wednesday of the month rather than every week?
(I already organize a meetup about web analytics, so I can't put my hand up to arrange this.)

Look I understand why you USAians think governments are automatically corrupt, slow and incompetent because it's your only experience. But it's far from universal. If you don't think a determined government couldn't mount a 51% attack, you're delusional.

Guys, you'll wanna be careful here. Anonymous donations to policial parties aren't really allowed in Australia. You'll need to get disclosure of identity for any donations, and report them to the AEC over the disclosure limit.
(Little chance of that from current donations though, it seems.)

Outside your little libertarian fantasy zone, most of the world doesn't have a problem with the concept of taxation and would prefer if everyone paid their fair share.

Being a decent person is not a "Christian Value".
As in my original message here, I want to help the people who've had disaster strike. I don't want to fund marketing for an organisation devoted to a sky fairy.

I've bought from these guys recently, before they had Bitcoin, and today encouraged to post here. Well recommended. 
RPMC bundle was my purchase. Plays 1080p video which is amazing for something so small, cheap and no moving parts.
