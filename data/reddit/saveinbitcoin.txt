For everyone else trying to do the same, just buy consistently every week. Do it regardless of the price. The key here is Consistently.
It's called Dollar Cost Averaging and it is usually the best way to buy an asset if you can't predict its price (99% of folks, including me, can't).

We're in that stage of this cycle, yes.

Those grandparents are great.
Instead of an one-off gift, one could start a Bitcoin accumulation plan for a baby.
Imagine putting like $10 every week, for many years.
SaveinBitcoin is a software I wrote to do exactly that: repeatedly buy bitcoin and send to wallet, automatically. You can learn more by checking my profile.

I use my software (saveinbitcoin.com, it's free and open source) to automate my purchases.
Bitstamp is where I buy my bitcoins. 0.25% fees and free withdrawals.

The new dashboard is under construction, but the current version of the software is working already.

I developed a software similar to Coindca.
It is called SaveinBitcoin, and I released it as an open source software that everyone can use for free.
Check it out at SaveinBitcoin.com.
For now it only supports Bitstamp (for many good reasons stated on the site, low cost being one of those), but it could support other exchanges in the future.

I don't know, from what you say it looks to me you are investing a bit too much.
Personally I like to set an amount I know I'll always be comfortable with, so I can automate it, skip the weekly decision about "+" and free up mental space.
BTC is important but real friends are too!

Indeed. Even better if you could put like 5 dollars every week.

I wrote a software that automatically buys some bitcoin for me every day, I called it SaveinBitcoin and released it for free as a gift to the bitcoin community.
