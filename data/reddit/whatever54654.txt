Donate to WINE
Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, &amp; BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.

You need a lesson in economics, not Bitcoin. Prices of goods and services are decoupled from BTC and will continue to be until Bitcoin finds a stable price.
In your fast forward to the future where BTC functions as currency, you forgot to consider the supply and demand of the goods and services that currency measures. Currency is not the only thing subject to inflation/deflation.

Stop giving your private key to random websites. You need to use a wallet. If you can't remember your password, think really hard and if you still can't remember think harder.

Give money to the WINE project at winehq.org which has been building a compatability layer between Windows and Linux/BSD/MacOS for 20 years.
Here is a video of DOOM (2016) running on Linux thank to WINE

What inspire me, is teaching African refugees how to program Javascript. What inspires me is finding out how to use MagLev trains to get resources to the moon. These are the challenges that tomorrow's going to face

It seems that replys are ignored by the downvote bots. As far as I can tell, the bots are upvoting the guy who wants a donation to prevent deforestation.

They don't take donations that large unfortunately. If you try to donate more, they tell you they don't process donations more than $5,000.

tl;dr run windows programs on Linux, BSD, and MacOS.
also, this won't be my first post - there are tons of other projects you should donate to

Redistribution is just another word for theft.
Bitcoin (and other forms of money) is not wealth. You think that the distribution of BTC and other currencies is a problem because you mistake money for wealth. Currency is to wealth as a ruler is to length, i.e. it's a measure.
When you decouple currency from wealth you see that A: it's not a zero sum game, and B: wealth can abound and multiply across all layers of society, no matter the situation of the currency.

At these prices it's like you're literally stealing.
But seriously, OP YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY FUCKED. THIS IS GOING NOWHERE QUICKLY. THE BOTTOM IS LOWER.
