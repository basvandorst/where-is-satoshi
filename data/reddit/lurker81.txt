Maybe over the past couple of weeks, looks pretty flat over the past few months...

Why not just sell a portion?
Seems in the next few months larger institutional investors will get involved, which will make it easier to buy for the masses.

And if he sold a significant portion it would still tank MSFT.

The same could be said about Bill Gates, Bezos, Buffett, etc.

Yeah I use electrum, just wondering about hard wallet alternatives.

What do you recommend?

If people "need" to understand that, it should be made much more clear and transparent. Regular people aren't going to know what a satoshi is or even what a byte is for that matter. Or how it relates to their transaction. 
All people will give a shit about is how much it costs to send $10/$100/$1000 etc.

So true, both subs are getting ridiculous. Reminds me of nerds fighting over star trek vs star wars. 
That being said, obviously star trek is best. :)

I know you've updated your post, consider updating again with the 3 and 24hr average numbers. Could be helpful.

Exactly, it would be nice to see that spare cash turn into a nice surprise in a few years time.

Same here. I just found one near my place, I'm looking forward to converting my spare cash to BTC regularly. And in only a few seconds.
