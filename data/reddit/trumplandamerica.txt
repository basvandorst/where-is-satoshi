I refuse to have my vote bought for such a low price. I wont consider yang unless he makes it $2,000 a month

Okay maduro

Not yelling commie makes it look like you don’t understand history. Joseph mccarthy was right. We see the ebidence of it everyday

You guys must be white nazis! Yang warned me about you guys in a recent speech. He said soon white men would be shooting down chinese americans!

It would be terrible but i doubt he will do it. His chief of staff mulvaney is v pro btc

Sorry but this is an ignorant commentary. You should study what dissidents inside of these countries say. They WANT the sanctions. They know tyrannical govts use trade to enrich themselves and oppress their poor

Guys. Please dont sell me counterfeit bitcoinz

This seems problematic right? Even if lightning network is successful, assuming btc experiences huge growth, the network will clog

Why is it a non topic
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:52:11
I grew up thinking like a leftist. Anti american.  Designed my own major centered around american foreign policy and how harmful it was. 
Ive studied this topic deeply and changed my mind.  You?
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:50:46
Trumps admin is infinitely more pro btc than a Hillary admin would ever be

Milo is great. Fuck coinbase.

Only in bitcoin reddit can you find people who think a socialist will be better for bitcoin than a republican
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:35:53
Well done

Just say youre antifa and want to punch nazi republicans and youll be fine

America doesnt abuse other countries w that power. Just shitholes like iran nk china and russian. America is incredibly benign given how much power it has
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:41:16
It is impressive how bitcoin supporters in this reddit are so extremely hostile to republicans. The lesser of two evils at the moment
@_date: 2019-05-18 04:58:54
Kind of sad how many users expose themselves here when they talk about politics
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:26:53
Cool comment. Trumps chief of staff actually started a btc caucus.  But yeah lets support btc freedom then democrats who would be more likely to try and regulate btc.
