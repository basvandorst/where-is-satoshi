windows 8 i believe
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:44:57
so, im not super techy, but the harddrive is in the tower/case. its a gaming computer . i need to see a video on removing the hdd. so when i am able to do this, how would i check to see if theres any bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:00:20
i dont know how to check to see if theres any to begin with, but i want to make sure.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:45:25
the hdd is in the case, is that easy to take apart?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:19:41
well who wouldnt...
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:15
i like this option, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:12:28
If the keys aren't on the device, then where are they located? If it's in some sort of website/cloud, then isn't that the same (security risk) as an online wallet?
And the person who stole it could theoretically physically hold down the two buttons and thus make transactions, no?
Will read those articles, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:45:29
thank you!

I have to get my gemini account approved by doing a bank transfer. when i went to my bank, they laughed and said that it would cost 70$ ish to complete it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:20:20
Any idea how much the 2x coins will be worth? Essentially I'm getting free money just by having btc?
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:17:36
Yeah I'm leaving it in cb until after the fork!
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:13:33
Yeah I get it, it's just that the way some people worded it that j don't appreciate. Scared noobs like myself into getting one by making it seem absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:01:54
Awesome, thanks for your kindness once again! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:22:08
It's also beyond optimistic to ever expect it to hit 1 million lol...
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:43:06
Seems like for the time being best to use airbitz and eventually a hardware wallet. Thanks for all the help.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:10:35
Why are forks seen as bad though? This seems great lol
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:43:47
actually you confirm by inputting the 2 deposit amounts that gdax does for verification purposes, just an fyi. nevertheless, thank yoU!
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:01:26
Is it noob friendly / easy to deposit my coinbase balance onto it?
Also, should I wait before I do it, because I heard coinbase will give you free segwit coins for any amount you have in your cb wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:03:52
Will do.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:27:04
Not much at all, and I already bought the nano s due to everyone pressuring and saying how dumb it is to have your coins on coinbase :/
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:24:48
But when the bch fork happened,all those who had btc could bch added for free, and then could have just sold those coins and made free money for doing essentially nothing? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:14:28
What happens if you lose your trezor/ledger?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:17:23
Thanks dude. Since you don't use a ledger, what do you use?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:37:10
Even so, we are getting free money essentially just by having some BTC? Like, I can just immediately sell the 2x coins and will just make some extra money while still having the same amount of BTC?
Sounds too good to be true
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:31:53
I don't get it though - I'm getting free coins for nothing? I could get those free 2x coins, and then immediately sell them, and therefore make a quick buck - again, for doing essentially nothing?
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:02:57
How do I set that up? Sounds like a good idea
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:41:53
What is the name of this address? And how do some generate a QR code?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:27:18
How do I do a bank transfer? I'd just have to input my bank routing number and account number and that's it right?
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:42:37
I'm not sure I understand the importance of generating a new address each time. Wouldn't it be tedious to have a new receive address each time?
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:15:58
Thanks for that.to clarify, airbitz does let you control your private keys right
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:07:41
I know of some possibilities of course, I was just trying to get some more input to see where other people put there keys. Some might be better than what I have thought of.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:04:51
Thanks, is DMs ok or would you prefer email?
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:49:54
Thanks, appreciate it. I'm not really that tech savy so a lot of the terms confuse me when I read/hear about them. That 2 our convo seems like a nice starting place.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:10:26
Thanks, appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:22:33
How did you lose it? Noob here
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:59:38
What’s the thing about a 25th password?
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:26:13
Interesting....I see. I could immediately sell upon getting the coins, and possibly be fortunate if the priec just crashes soon after. Or the opposite can happen and I could've sold at the lowest possible price. Tricky situation...
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:38:49
How does one educate them self as best as possible in order to make their decision? Because it seems like a wild guess on the surface, but I'm sure it's deeper than it appears.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:25:20
What if someone steals the device, will they have access to my coins?
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:11:43
why do you say it with so much certainty? bitcoin can also crash.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:10:01
Says the guy who can't read. I literally said I know of some ideas, can't hurt to ask and get some other input.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:31:13
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:24:37
I appreciate the offer! Will message you within the upcoming week hopefully.
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:03:03
Well of course. But I was just looking for some ideas on where to put it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:43:56
Just a quick question, still haven't listened to that video yet, but it's about the ledger nano. If it gets stolen, would that person have access to my keys? And is there like a pin or password that must be inputted for each transaction?
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:04:38
Good idea, thanks. Btw, even if I lose the recovery phrase, as long as I have the Ledger itself, I can reset it and make a new recovery phrase right?
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:03:21
That is a genius idea.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:02:12
what are some reputable sites that are almost as easy to get started as coinbase and have cheaper fees? gemini is too much of a hassle.

@_date: 2017-09-18 07:35:13
so each generated bitcoin gives off a private key? and the paper wallet stores those sets of numbers?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:17:30
The apps don't have any security measures to protect your coins from said malware?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:35:36
Why shouldn't you store a lot on mobile wallets? For future reference. I thought it was secure and much better than leaving it on coinbase, Gemini, etc
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:24:16
Informative, thanks. How would I move my coinbase BTC to my airbitz acct? I have it downloaded already so will just go with that, and it sounds good since if I lose my phone, I can still recover the coins.
Also, aren't the same malware concerns possible from hardware wallets as well?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:41:51
How cheap is it and how user friendly for noobs?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:40:36
Does storing on a mobile wallet protect me from forks? I don't really know what that is but read a lot of people telling others to move their coins that are on coinbase for that reason.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:16:08
Or maybe you did it yourself - thinking it could end up on the front page, give you exposure, and thus some free bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:23:38
If this reached the front page, it would probably get at least 10-20k views. You conveniently mentioned that the account currently has 0 btc. Some people might be inclined to give a very small donation - but that could add up because of the 10k+ potential donors.
I just think it's very unlikely someone actually wrote that.
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:20:53
I don't really get how you can physically store a bitcoin in a hardware wallet / paper wallet. Like, I don't get how a piece of paper can somehow give you a bitcoin value.
@_date: 2018-12-23 03:56:41
Thank you
@_date: 2018-12-22 22:51:51
Thank you, will do! It sounds like a relatively easy process.
