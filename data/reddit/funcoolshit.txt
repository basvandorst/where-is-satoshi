Thanks for the advice.  We made the payment, do you know what the chances are that they will provide the decryption keys?  The BTC transaction successfully settled a couple of hours ago, I have yet to receive an email with the keys though : (.  The comment below was pretty pessimistic about not receiving the decryption, I'm beginning to think that our files are good as gone.

Never used a bitcoin ATM, is it as straightforward as depositing cash and then it sends the amount to my wallet?  Quick and easy?  Any significant wait period until the funds are available?

Thanks for this, didn't know there was a library of unlockers!  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there is one for "ZERWIX DECRYPTOR".  Is there another such library?

Looks like they sent the decryptor and it worked.  Is there any use to submitting the decryption software to the security community, like the forum you linked to?  Would it assist them in "cracking the code" for others to use?  I imagine this software is designed to prevent this from happening, but I figured I would ask.

Thanks for the sentiment.  We have an IT guy that manages everything, I simply can't believe that he doesn't have off line back ups.  I would love to tell them to fuck off.

Thank you for the advice, I will make a back up of the encrypted files.  I appreciate your input on this.

I hate to hear this.  Does the term "ZERWIX" look familiar?  It is the name of the decryption software.

Wow, I was considering using Coinbase to get started with Bitcoin, but now I am not so sure.  This problem that the OP is having, with the API key, seems easily fixable and avoidable, but this thread has opened up my awareness to other major concerns.  Especially after visiting r/coinbase, it seems that this service is ripe with problems.  Am I just exposed to the small percentage that are experiencing trouble, or is Coinbase a truly unreliable service?  I've been reading that it is really just a middle man for transactions.   
Also, if I remember correctly, it seems that I read about Coinbase getting a large amount of capital from an investment firm?
