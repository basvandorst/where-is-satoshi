With that hint I wouldn't even try to brute force the password anymore.. Only numeric combinations like (7384) have already been checked according to the original submission. Furthermore alphanumeric + 18 special chars combinations have been checked. Therefore I would just go through a couple of logical combinations that include one of the following B⃦฿ɃᗸB⃫Ⓑⓑᴃⓢ
For example:
Another possibility would be that the passphrase contains .1 or ,1 since the starting amount of the encrypted wallet was 0.1 Bitcoins. 
I would try it out myself but I can't get a BIP38 encryptor to work at the moment :D
EDIT: spelling

Good point but Kreuzberg is also the neighborhood with the highest concentration of crimes in Germany. Additionally this is an article of the Guardian. I don't think we have had much positive coverage of Bitcoin from the german press.

This only says that Germany is big into hosting services don't you think?

Try explaining that to the "Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht"

Not as I see it... 
only Banks can set up Bitcoin ATMs in Germany at the moment... the rest is quite self explanatory
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:18:40
yup also just read the article.. best move my bitcoins to cold storage soon
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:20:26
hmm good point.. but does it even matter where the nodes a located? Isn't only their calculation power relevant?

Yes I agree you can move your assets into Bitcoin very easily. However in the US one could literally live exclusively on bitcoin which seems impossible to me in Germany.
