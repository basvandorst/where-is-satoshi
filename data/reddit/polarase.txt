I haven't used my full SSN anywhere for registration. And it should stay like that.

Bitrift, an Android app, is a great portfolio app.

I believe that coinbase only needs the last four digits which is safer.

How were you able to take a screenshot on mobile? My Android phone doesn't let me do it on the app.

I'll pass on this because it requires full SSN for registration. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:25:05
Android version please?

You don't need SSN for Coinbase. Just need License or ID.

Woah, did you see that sell that a bunch of people were doing at once on gdax?

Are you saying that the price of altcoins is backed up buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:31:02
What popular altcoins are like this?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:15:46
Should have bought a little more at the dip. Going back up now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:22:20
People saw the small dip to $12.9k and started buying immediately. Man, it is fun to watch gdax when Bitcoin reaches a milestone. 
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:38:35
Not too far down at least
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:50:22
