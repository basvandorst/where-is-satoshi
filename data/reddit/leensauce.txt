Hey dude, I actually apologize for coming off a bit rude earlier. I was in a bad mood from work and had just gotten done reading some actual woman-bashing comments in another subreddit so I think I took my annoyance out a bit too much on you. Looking back at your comments it seems like you might just be joking around and having fun so I’m sorry for being a downer. Hope you have a good rest of your day.

Yikes. Are you an incel, a virgin, or just an unamusing troll? I can't tell which.
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:32:41
Lol. Because only guys go on Reddit I guess. Also, I was saying yikes because that’s what Bcash always says.

I was using that word on purpose, I lurk this forum often. 
And, though I DO appreciate your username, it does irk me to come here hoping to find interesting conversations to read regarding bitcoin technology and price, but instead reading comments about bitcoin being unrational/unstable/etc. "like a woman"...and then a bunch of seemingly sarcastic comments about how "woke" and "feminist" you've become. 
If it's all a harmless joke, then carry on. I'm just saying that I've never seen any women act sexist and compare bitcoin to "hostile, violent men", so I don't really understand the sexist comments. I'm just wishing Bitcoin hodlers could be a little more peaceful with one another, even if the space is more male-dominated...

You're an idiot.

Lol, I didn’t even disagree with your post, even went back to read it and thought it was quite informative...but changing all of your comments the way you just did just makes you truly look childish and moronic like he said.  Posting your predictions is cool, who cares if internet people you’ll never meet don’t like it...learn how to deal with critics

Do you by chance have a link for the article you're referring to?
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:45:34
Damn straight

Well, alrighty mate, carry on I guess lol
