Doing my part. Have a full node running on one of these little things from 2011.
Runs a BTC and SUP full node. Data is on a NAS.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:01:10
Pretty much it. I've got it running on a small Atom box that uses 40w total max. (more likely running 20w). Its just to benefit the community.
It took FOREVER to sync up, but once done, it keeps up with the network. Its got 72 connections at this moment.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:12:57
It would have to be really small to start. I don't have very much at all. Just wanting to do my part
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:39:06
To answer the question? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:33:06
Waiting for the day to add LN to my little Bitcoin Full Node sitting under my desk. He's just doing his thing for free on the network.
Will be nice to get something else than the satisfaction of helping the network.

What if I told you that you don't have to agree with everyone all the time?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:41:47
That's what I meant. Not destroy the full node (especially since it took 3 weeks to sync up)
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:49:43
Really excited to convert my BTC full node to LN when available.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:22:02
Odd, my Nano address doesn't show anything. (I did end up with a small bit of BTG during that split.

They didn't create the law, it was the law and they decided to actually enforce it, hence announcing the policy change of "zero tolerance." They didn't make the law, Congress did. Executive Branch enforces the law with the resources granted them by spending bills allocated by Congress.
Just because you refuse to open your eyes, doesn't make you right. And going straight to the "Nazi" claim only proves your ignorance and willingness to follow your marching orders.
Calling someone you have no knowledge of whom they are or what they are a "Nazi" is pathetic. If that's all you need to do to make yourself feel better about your lot in life, then I'm sorry for you.
"Nice Try"

I see no proof that he support Obama.

You must really despise the world you wake up in. All I see in your responses is a deep hatred for a boogieman; one that doesn't exist. I'm really glad I don't know you personally. You should take a good look in a mirror at yourself. You are the type of person you hate. 
You know nothing about me, or my view, but I've learned all I need to know about your deep seeded hatred. 
Maybe a refresher in basic human dignity is what you need. Maybe a look into what those "concentration camps" are. 
Hate away though, it is your right. I really do feel sorry for you. 
You are hate.

But, I thought orange man is bad with everything he does... =P
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:49:19
Coinbase. $2.00 charge wasn't bad. I'm sure there are other places though. Just the one other's talk about. Moving it to my own wallet now. Something where I own the private keys.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:41:07
Easy way to do it right now. Later I'll dive into maxing profits, but for now, I like the ease of use
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:03:39
.014 from mining. And .0668 from purchase over the past week.
Seems like so little, but I'll eventually get to that 1.
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:12:34
What has the ease of use minus the high transmit fees? I'm still up on my purchases from the past week and a half, but I'd like to not give them such a high cut if I could.
Looking for something to tie a card to
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:06:31
I've mostly done NiceHash, just selling my hashing power. I've got a 1060 6gb. Overclocked to 2062/4252. 
As I type this morning, currently making $1.79/day dual mining Eth/Pasc. Set it up to bounce between 4 different algos, whichever is making the most at that time.
Also, I've been mining Superior Coin prior to it going on the exchanges. Low risk at this point, and if it doesn't pan out, I've only put in maybe $5 in electricity into it. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:49:46
I'm hoping for a major correction. The future will always be higher overall, but I want to actually make a bit of bitcoin at the lower price through mining. My 1060 went from .0065 to .004 daily just this afternoon.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:58:34
Curious as well. I've got a small little atom box that's not doing anything. Has enough ram and HD, but not sure about the cpu requirements, if it could keep up
@_date: 2017-08-08 04:26:42
End goal will be to hold and withdraw small amount when needed, much like a retirement account.
There's not many places locally yet that take Bitcoin (or any coin for that matter), but that will eventually change. 
I've got money sitting in Paypal that i earmarked for a computer build by year's end. Probably makes sense to pull that out and buy coin with it at this point. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:54:03
If you don't already have the hardware in hand, its risky buying parts to mine.
I'll mine until its no longer feasible 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:33:08
Expected. And its a good thing. Can't have +10% gains daily for a week without a correction. Its not healthy
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:59:01
Put $50 into BTC, and $50 into Ethereum.
I've got just over $40 from mining since the first week in July.
Gotta start somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:00:26
Electricity is only $.12/kwh here. Much better than the $.35/kwh in California.
Even with this overclocked beast, I'm only using $.48/day. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:36:16
So I don't forget when I finally got the bug, I bought just a hair over 3200.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:19:31
It looks like around 2 days to update first. That's not too bad honestly for what its doing.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:35:54
Wondering about the extra resource load on this. Freeing up space on an old Atom box to put a node on, and of course the appeal would be to earn some extra bitcoin for doing so. 
Not sure what the system requirements would be in the end for an LN node.
Edit: Took some digging but found some good news   
A LN node is like a smaller bitcoin node that opens and lets others payment channels on the network. Hardware requirements are minimal; they don’t have to be full bitcoin nodes, they can run on the same hardware at the same time as a bitcoin node, and in fact they are being designed to run on a smartphone. To begin with, it is suggested to simply run LN nodes alongside Bitcoin nodes, perhaps on a $5 Raspberry Pi, “for maximum security,” according to Poon."

Its just a little spindle drive. 
This is the computer.
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:34:38
I already feel great on the buy. Like everyone else, I wish I'd have stuck with it back when I considered minding back in 2013.
Living in California at the time didn't help. (Electric rates)
Mining with a GTX1060, I've picked up .011BTC. Not too bad tbh, but I wasn't content waiting on the mining and just decided to not miss out on the rise that's coming. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:59:06
That's why I jumped in. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:05:44
That's one of the tools I make use of frequently. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:58:11
Thanks for the advice! I'll look into it. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:21:31
Going to give it a try. If it doesn't work, then no loss.
I'll let everyone know how it goes.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:16:05
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:20:00
Bought a few hundred in small increments of $50 or so over the past week. Prices between 3200 to 4200. I'm still ahead. Even if it drops to 2k, I'll still consider myself good in the long run.
Intent is to hold for a LONG time.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:41:06
add an extra 0 there
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:14:41
There are two Nicehash clients out there. 
I'm using the legacy client as it seems to be more stable and less "easy" to use.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:02:12
I think that's wise. If you do withdraw(to further the cause), put money back in. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:20:40
Super low powered Atom is taking +2 weeks.

That was a mental block for me prior. I thought owning a partial coin was pointless. The vast majority of people will never own a whole coin, and that's OK.
Like any other investment, diversify. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:51:28
The amount of investment vs potential gain is too bit to pass up.
If I treat this like any other long term investment, and use money that I'm not really missing at that moment, it could really help set my later years up well. I owe it to my family to try this. 
In the end, its as riskly, if not less than dumping my money into a 401k or my pension.
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:40:27
Already did once it was available on Nano S
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:41:13
Fully aware of how it used to be. Just was shocked when it blew up yesterday to what it hadn't done in a while. Took +4 hours for my first confirmation.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:04:24
Excellent! I'll make use of this for sure.
That's a much cleaner and quicker interface than the NiceHash one
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:10:59
For mining? 
July 12th was my first payment. I've not been mining full time either since this is my main gaming rig. Just running the mining while I'm idle. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:13:22
Treating it like an extremely long term investment. Diversifying between 401k, pension, real estate, other investments.
Think of how many people lost a TON in 401k back in '08 when they retired. Bitcoin is volatile, but the upward tend is clear. Day to day its risky, but I believe in the end, its a sound investment.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:05:07
Even more so 7 hours after you posted this
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:44:47
Transactions being backed up today, and mempool has increased in size 10 fold.. wth.
I should have checked the transaction costs before I sending that transaction out.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:43:43
Give it a couple of hours.
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:26:35
You jinxed it
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:44:23
Those people that said it wouldn't hit 7k this year.. where are they now?
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:10:36
Just about 6800 on gdax. Crazy day
Edit: And now it is 6800

Just saw a buy Bitcoin here sign at a mall on Colorado Springs. It's becoming more and more common and normal.

Downloading now.. Might take a while on this little Atom CPU though.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:15:22
So, by the end of the year, which 2018 crash will this be referring to?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:55:42
Was hoping for a good drop below 3k this morning before I bought. Missed it on the way into the office

My little Atom D525  is still syncing. Been building syncing the chain since last month on .14. Moved the data to the NAS and took it off of wifi and updated it to .15.
Now it has 4 days left.

This is beautiful....
Its a nice song too.
