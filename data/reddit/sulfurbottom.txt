I keep thinking to myself, Bitcoin will survive if the internet wills it to survive. I am not sure if the EFF was ever a strong proponent of Bitcoin and judging from their comments it just sounds like they were simply testing the waters.  In they end, they are one organization.  If the internet perseveres and we get people actually trading these things for goods and services (instead of hoarding) the currency will be just fine.

Anyone know if the faucet site will ever be back up?  When I got started it was already down.  I never got my free BTC.

I am sure she would love a pair. 
Don't forget fathers day coming up.  Maybe he would like a pair too.  Two birds with just a few BTC.
For the record I am not affiliated with these people in any way.

These are really cool.  
You get to move a little BTC around b/c of their fees and get a cool card.  Basically bitcoin gift cards in 1, 5, 10, and 20 BTC denominations

Bah, this makes too much sense and would likely scare off the masses.  Remember those kids that could never convert meters to kilometer?  
If Bitcoin is really going to take off as *the* currency for the internet, then it needs to be so simple that grandma can use it.

Can 5% really crash the value of the other 95%?  Also, don't forget that with new bitcoins being created every day the power of that 5% will decay over time.

No, I don't have much experience.  Why else would I have asked?
