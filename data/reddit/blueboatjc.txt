I have no interesting in reading about a virtual currency in a physical publication.

Want to send me a referral code?

That's crazy.  Certainly not how it was done when I worked as a bank teller in high school a decade ago.

Something else is going on here.  I would doubt this is directly related to Bitcoins. When a bank puts a hold on an account, they don't do it by withdrawing a huge amount of money. This is a bank error. Most likely someone entered the wrong account information or withdrawal amount. It's showing up as a hold because you obviously didn't have anywhere near that amount of money in your account. It's most likely an internal error with BoA and I'm sure they'll fix it.
You have absolutely no proof or even reason to suspect this has something to do with Bitcoins.

I don't know what Chase "private bank" is, but Chase Private Client is for higher net worth individuals.  It's actually particularly good for bitcoin transactions because incoming and outgoing wire transfers are free.  I've heard all of these horror stories about Chase, bitcoins and wire transfers, but I've never had any problems or questions about it at all.  I've transferred close to 6 figures of bitcoin/$ in either direction and never gotten a question about it.  Random fact is that the best part about it is they automatically reimburse fees from other bank's ATMs - even $6 fees I've gotten in Atlantic City.
