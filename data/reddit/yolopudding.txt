Truth is no one really knows.. this is totally my opinion. :/  I will say I flipped some ETH for more BTC this morning. All cryptos have been rough today. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:11:44
I'm a holder, m8. Guess the clip doesn't make the point clear.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:15:09
Personally I like reading these stories.. but to each their own.
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:03:52
Haha, I often wonder why people like you hang out on this sub.
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:52:13
Damn algos ruin everything.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:49:40
Who knows, I might have been early... I just don't see the grand pappy coin not popping back up.
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:22:13
You actually got your ducks in a row before posting about it in Reddit... kudos, amigo.
I've got a pretty hefty chunk of change that's in bonds. Most are not gaining any value anymore. I'm hevily considering doing a similar thing soon. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:41:48
Right?! I cracked up.
@_date: 2019-07-04 14:55:54
Holy shit that's a ton of money
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:25:40
He's not worshiping him. Just realized that he's not this huge villan that most had painted him as. If I remember right his company put 60+% of their revenue into research and development where as most big pharmas put around 20%.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:00:24
In relation to first price I think the main thing is risk vs reward. I can risk 10k and it is **entirely possible** I could make 990k on it. It's also possible I could lose 99% of it. (But I only lose 10k)
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:17:16
so 1:1 scale.. got it. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:57:33
This is spot on. The only thing I'd add is when new holders get scared and sell off, the regret they feel after watching BTC go parabolic is 10x worse than the loss of their initial investment would have been. Now there are people who beat themselves up daily because they know they missed their chance at being a millionaire. **In the end you're going to lose your initial investment or you're going to lose your potential profit.** One of those numbers is much bigger than the other.

I was about to make this exact comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:54:31
This is me now, too. After making the mistake of telling some of my Edward Jones friends about holding Bitcoin (first mentioned around the $2k level) they made some snide comments about making sure I'm only holding what I want to lose. Now that cryptos are popping and everyone's talking about it I've had a good chuckle at their expense. Problem being now they are always putting me on the spot in front of their clients, some of which are also my clients. A few occasions asking how much I'm holding, etc. Dont get me wrong, I love talking to people about bitcoin, but these guys have no shame (and still make snide comments about a system they've never truly tried to understand). Now I tell then I sold at 15k and wished I didn't. 
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:31:57
Really r/btc should just change to r/bch and all would be fine
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:14:52
that's a lot of stapling. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:32
wut? how do you figure a 30% correction = 90%? Just because the volume is higher?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:12:31
where are you buying xrb?
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:12:03
Silk Road is definitely still a possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:43:43
This is the most accurate answer IMO.
@_date: 2018-09-21 20:07:53
I've not seen that confirmed. Where'd you see it?
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:42:29
When I learned this fact (3+ years ago) I immediately purchased my first Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:16:17
Why not do it now I wonder? It seems they're actively doing the opposite. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 18:07:09
I still just don't understand why all these bears hang out here and comment on every thread. How is that enjoyable?
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:14:06
Getting downvoted? Thought it was interesting crypto news. PayPal sees Bitcoin as a threat. Seems important we all understand this.
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:44:58
Exactly. I'm honestly saddened by some of the things I see on here anymore. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:43:15
So you have no long term belief in the use of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:32:01
Why are you here? Like, honestly asking.
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:39:30

Why is this downvoted?!?
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:37:06
Are you able to turn a profit mining and paying for electric? Or is this just a funny?
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:48:33
You can use both! If you're planning on holding long term you should move that to your Trezor. Getting fluent moving BTC is helpful too. Good luck:)
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:09:40
Hah. Yeah I mean I get the joke but I'm just wondering if this dude is actually mining or not.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:07:42
Sure do. I'm using GDAX currently and sending them straight to the Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:48:16
I see a bright and giffy-meme future for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:18:09
yeah. Trezor sends you a key (a random string of 24 words that you can use to get your coins back in the even it's lost, stolen, or broken. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:09:18

I'm with you. OG wizard tat on the ass at 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:13:59
Totally your choice... I've been holding bitcoin for almost a year, and started using a Trezor a few months ago.  Before that I just kept coins in GDAX and Coinbase. I don't think it's super risky to hold them on coinbase (like a lot of other users constantly say)...  but there is no better feeling knowing you have your coins on your own device with your own personal keys. IMO if you plan on staying in crypto for the long term,  its a no brainer. Less risk is always better. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:45

I never really thought about it, but adjusting for the gains, people on Silk Road paid like 5k for a gram of weed.

I own a Trezor. Best $100 ever spent. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:10:14
haha... well I was paraphrasing... the key is generated by the Trezor and only displayed on the Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:17:20
ehh.. usually you're totally right but it seems bitcoin likes to ignore traditional trading logic and moves almost exclusively on news.

Commenting for spot in history books. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:20:31
yeah....There are no fees for most any transactions. You can send coins to and from coinbase/GDAX for free. They are actually the same company, Coinbase being just a easier (debatably) cleaner version...
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:17:38
 You're set. Cheers:)

If only we had a platform that connects us all instantly anywhere in the world...
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:42:13
I totally agree. Personally I think it could be another potential buying opportunity. Initial shock could push price down and new hype/buzz around Satoshi could spring it back upward. Would be really interesting IMO.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:27:56
Thanks! I thought the fact that BCH was up 25% during the interview and all other coins they showed were in the red was a little fishy... But you're right. Nothing to see here... Move along. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:25:03
Wow. Guessing you're just an Alex Jones fan, so I apologize for calling you a foil hat...  I listened to the whole interview, it was EXACTLY like every time I've heard Ver talk (core sucks, buy Bitcoin cash). The guy should just get a Yak Bak. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:59:31
As a yolo scientist I have to totally agree with all of this other than the last line. Let's say *currently* impossible?

@_date: 2019-05-13 16:58:46
Right. It would be cool if correlation equaled causation, but you can look at the charts on pretty much any timescale and see that BTC price and stocks don't seem to strongly correlate.
