If this is the case why not just straight purchase bitcoin? At least it's break even less fees and the spread.
Mining at a loss makes no economic sense whatsoever. While waiting for the price of bitcoin/cost of mining to reach equilibrium it is likely that the hardware will suffer damage or become outdated.

This is not even a clever way of looking at things. It’s just plain wrong.
Firstly, the interbank currency markets are closed. Currency values are difficult and practically impossible to determine until the market is reopened on Sunday night. Even if you are going to compare the USD to cryptocurrency pairs and make the argument that it is being pumped against these pairs, you would be considered highly conspiratorial considering the market cap of crypto ($120B) versus the daily traded volume of currencies on the interbank markets ($5-6 TRILLION)
Secondly, looking at known external factors and correlated asset prices, the USD has been super stable for the past week despite the decline in US stock valuations, T-bonds, and commodity craziness. This makes it unlikely that over the past 24 hours alone, the USD is being pumped.

If you trade on faith (of the currency/commodity/whatever) you're going to have a bad time.

All your points in your first paragraph are wrong. Come back when you have more of an understanding of what currency and money is.
