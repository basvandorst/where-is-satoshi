You're right. this is what the facecash lawsuit is all about (which includes a bunch of bitcoin exchanges as defendants). It's also why it's a joke to shut down mtgox's dwolla account for not being fincen registered. Fincen registration doesn't make you an MSB. All US bitcoin exchanges are not MSB compliant just like mtgox and operating in violation of multiple state laws. The FinCen registration you could probably do yourself in an hour.. it's literally a registration, they want to know who you are and that's about it. It is not an MSB license.

well they know who you are.. they could perhaps take a look at people you know on other services such as facebook, reddit etc and maybe it's one of them.. there are only maybe 200k people using bitcoin so it's not a huge search space to begin with. the pizza service probably sweeps their coins from the payment address into storage somewhere and they can map out those address clusters and know that you used it to buy a pizza.

All the bitcoin exchanges are behind cloudflare which (probably) allows the authorities to scrape the html when you withdraw to your wallet and determine what btc addresses are associated with your exchange account, ip, email address etc.

eh. this is what smartcards are for.. the terminal asks for your pin to make the smartcard sign a transaction and it signs it.. your key never leaves the card so there's no way for the merchant to copy it. They could trick you into singing a different transaction than the one you thought you were signing, but it would be obvious if they'd done that when you later check your transaction history.

eh. They might be able to make that stick for large commercial mining operations. I can't see any personal bitcoin miners declaring it on their tax.. it's not a huge amount of money they're making - not enough to attract attention. It would of course be nicer if the authorities would write their laws in such a way as to not criminalize all the people who will never be declaring mining income.
