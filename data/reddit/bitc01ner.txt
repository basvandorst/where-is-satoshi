Does anyone know any facts on where he is?
It seems a very different story if he is rich and able to avoid the press and not suffer a Dorean :)
Just saw this one as well...
I see pop corn in the making.

Maxwell has to answer for this! With this level of BS, no wonder Mike is upset.

Maxwell is a liar!

It seems that there are many lies surrounding this story.
Maxwell has something to explain.

While everyone was looking the other way Wright has paid off all the debts and hidden... If you read the documents the tax people signed a settlement and Wright paid it.
