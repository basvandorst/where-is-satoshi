But bitcoin doesn't even have basic contract enforcement...only escrow

Keyword being **your life**.
It's very interesting that you hold belief that since water, healthcare etc. are **necessary** goods and services, that it should be provided for by government.
Food is a necessary resource, yet that isn't centrally distributed by government.


Right and left libertarians disagree on the definition of freedom. Wikipedia distinguishes between "positive" and "negative" freedoms. I believe it is very useful in order to distinguish the tenants behind right and left libertarians.
Negative freedom is freedom from external restraint, where Positive freedom is freedom to realise one's potential.
This is crucial.
In a right libertarian's perspective, positive liberty is not freedom; but **power**. It is a claim on a resource possessed by a person, or persons.
The freedom provided by 'free' education, healthcare, water, and other resources is very different compared to some freedoms guaranteed in the US Constitution: freedom of association, freedom from unreasonable search and seizures, etc.
**Negative freedom is freedom *from* coercion.**


No-one is forced to work. That would be slavery. One could argue that it is wage slavery, and somehow directly comparable to chattel slavery. It isn't. We are talking semantics here, and thus it is not.


Who determines this "general level"? According to you, the government should, and it should be imposed on everyone.
The right libertarian believes that the market should determine that.


You're using the word freedom very very loosely here, and I dislike it.
The law is preventing me to exercise my freedom in murdering masses of people.
In a laissez-faire capitalism, the rich could only become rich by providing goods and services for the lowest possible prices. A monopoly can only exist if the market demands it (which is by providing the best goods and services for the lowest possible prices). Cartels should not exist because it is always financially beneficial to break from a cartel than to be 'in on it'. Cartels only exist due government enforcement. (See governments handing out exclusivity contracts to telecom companies for regions; Also see cigarette advertisements. Cigarette companies noticed that advertising was a bottomless pit, thus they lobbied government to ban cigarette ads under the guise of public health. Now they save money.)

Can I then import the public key into blockchain.info so I can use their iOS app to watch the account, as well as make transactions (if I provide the private key)?
How would I go about making payments without having to type my private keys on any compromised systems (or is this never guaranteed unless it's an always offline machine)? I think I somewhat understand how Armory works, but I would need to dedicate a machine to that, right? Or do I only need to dedicate a USB drive?

Because I think the majority of people want contract law to exist
instead of the escrow we have now

There are too many people invested in Bitcoin for it to fail now.
If it's profitable to update Bitcoin, they will update it.

Very few encryption methods use double SHA256.
i.e. none

Trace Meyer is probably the best person for talks like this

Someone with a vest interest in destroying Bitcoin could easily take over the network e.g. maybe a government?

Split up the larger stashes into smaller, uneconomical to break, stashes

MtGox Domestic Bank Transfer
Bitcoins R Us
Blockchain.info via premium phone call
Spend Bitcoins
MtGox is the cheapest but takes 5-8 business days. Bitcoins R Us and Omnicoins (most cash deposit places) deposits at ~4pm every business day. Cheapest is either Omnicoins or Bitcoins R Us charging ~ 6-8%

arent 20% diff increases fortnight on fortnight equivalent to (1.2 + 1.2*1.2) / 2 which is an equivalent difficulty increase of ~32% month on month...
also setting the dates wrong and not taking into account the remaining days in te month is human error.
im guessing you're actually a miner who wants others to stay out of the game so you lose less in the long run
infact running the calculator myself putting both calculators at 0 power usage costs and 0 for the cost of the device and putting in 32% MM% on TGB calc and 20% difficulty increases on btcinvest.net
btcinvest.net yields 1.7 by the end of february, and TGB yields 1.67.
This is probably because it's not possible to adjust the starting date in btcinvest, so there's an additional difficulty increase on the 29th of December.

which is approximately every 2 weeks. are you going to argue that it's not exactly every fortnight? that's unpredictable variance




you're quoting the wrong site too

you can simply take
into account the difficulty rise month on month and convert it to fortnight on fortnight...
just chuck the month on month difficulty on 200% if youre that paranoid
clearly im a paid asic manufacturer shill.
bitcoin mining hasnt been profitable...ever.
buying btc for $1/10000btc back in 2009 and holding has clearly been the best strategy. maybe except buying asicminer at ipo
and selling at the peak.

If this is a problem, the core devs will update the bitcoin protocol, and the public will accept one

Unless you have a spare couple hundred grand, and very cheap electricity
You won't be able to mine.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:00:53
it doesnt, but you can simply compensate for that using higher difficulty jumps...
i guess it is misleading?
