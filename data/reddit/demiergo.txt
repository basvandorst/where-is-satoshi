I still see bitcoin as a theoretical solution to something like Greece, rather than something that is ready to help people en masse right now. The levels of knowledge and infrastructure to support mass adoption of bitcoin just aren't there yet.

Ah, there we go. Cash for comment in Bitcoin media once again.

Could make sense, it gets confusing sometimes when we see all these stories about banks using "Blockchain". Do they mean the bitcoin blockchain, some new distributed ledger they're building, or the company Blockchain.info?
