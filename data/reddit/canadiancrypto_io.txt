At some point we have to stop putting these people on pedestals thinking they are superhuman for their ability to make vast sums of money—and therefore when they speak we should all listen carefully.
The reality is that the markets are rigged and they are not making money because they are Warren Buffett clones. They are not clever people. They are just devious people who simply learned how to pull the wool over our eyes.
We need to start having more confidence in ourselves so that their words and doomsday announcements fall on deaf ears. 
I believe this does happen for the most part within the crypto community… but it pains me to see them get so much press. 
My two cents.

Plus, if you're a beginner right now, you can't simply take the normal 'easy entry' option of buying on Coinbase. You now have to learn about software/hardware wallets and private keys in order to get your coins off the exchanges.
I can't see a lot of newcomers figuring all that out in the next 5 days.
Of course, under normal circumstances, they should really have that figured out before buying on Coinbase—but historically it has been fine to just buy and leave on Coinbase for a few weeks/months.

Great explanation of Namecoin. Is it just .bit domains, or could it serve others in future?

Right. But what does that all mean for an opening trading price?

So, have I got this right—there are basically two  options open to everyone...
1. Hold and do nothing, and watch to see if BCC gains ground and your coins might be worth something someday
2. Sell asap because you think BCC will tank and you may as well get something for them

There was indeed a cash grab by ICANN. But I agree, keeping it streamlined and focusing on .bit would be the wise approach—at least initially.

Yeah I'm pretty much in the same boat as you. In BTC for the long haul.
But I'm just trying to wrap my head around everything so I at least have an idea what's going on in the markets when this all goes down.
But you're right. One thing I've learned for sure is that the whole cryptocurrency space is rigged by either exchanges, whales, hackers or ICO scam artists.
I'm not trying to spread FUD. But just venting frustration I guess at something that is supposed to be 'free and decentralised' is really just the same old thing. A playground for those in control to pull the strings—whatever way you look at it.
