If you use market orders you are demanding liquidity, which you have to pay for.

Not true. Futures are settled at the end of each trading day and positions can be closed up until a few days before maturity. Most futures contracts are never actually delivered. _Forward_ contracts, however, must be delivered, but these are not available to most investors. 
Options prices (like all derivatives) are determined by the market. You cannot buy an option for an arbitrary security at an arbitrary strike/maturity for an arbitrary price. The rule of no arbitrage is generally true for the average investor/trader.

You are asking about hedging strategies. Hedging generally involves identifying a risk, then buying derivatives to mitigate that risk. In the case of bitcoin, the risk you are worried about is so-called “tail-risk”, ie. the risk of a catastrophe. The financial crisis was a tail-risk event. Such events are generally difficult to quantify, since catastrophes are rare. A hedging strategy for the S&amp;P 500, for example, might involve buying call options on a volatility index, as large drops in the S&amp;P 500 are correlated with spikes in volatility.
Short futures contracts on bitcoin could help hedge some of this tail risk. However, the exact size of the contracts you buy depend on quantifying the risk you want to avoid. If you bought equal short and long positions, for example, your net would be 0 (minus trading fees). Nearly equal positions expose you to some risk, totally unequal positions expose you to the most risk, but the most potential reward. It’s up to you to strike a balance. 
Keep in mind that hedging is not free: all those brokerage fees add up. You’ll also have to have a margin account, and be able to handle margin calls, which I expect will be quite frequent with something as volatile as bitcoin.

Individual stocks are correlated with the overall market. So too with crypto. Imagine that one stock was over 80% of the total market cap of the stock market. Fluctuations in that stock would cause fluctuations in the overall market. People (rightly, I believe) see bitcoin as a bellweather for the overall crypto market. As btc goes, so goes the market. If other currencies get bigger and challenge bitcoin’s dominance, expect to see less correlation among individual currencies. This market is still minuscule, and will be for a while.
