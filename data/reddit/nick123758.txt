Volatility I guess

The descending triangle can easily break up, but that doesn't necessarily mean we're in a bull market. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:37:57
Higher highs, higher lows and an upward break from a descending channel over a somewhat longer time period. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:00:08
Have you been naughty or is this bullshit? 
@_date: 2018-09-10 08:58:46
I'm in the same boat.
I'm just not the DCA kind of guy. I think the price will fall to $3000 in 2019 and I will buy a shitload there. If $3000 doesn't hit I'll buy a shitload when it's obvious (to me) the bearmarket is over.
I did this in 2015 (at $250) and you guys know how that worked out.
When the euporia is high in I'll be buying.
@_date: 2018-09-10 09:03:08
I think this bear market will take longer than the bear market in 2014. Bitcoin was a small vessel back then, now it's an oil tanker.
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:03:15
Who made this? How? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:02:06


Yeah me too, but not before 2020.
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:38:13
I forgot to mention that the result also needs to be able to be reproduced.
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:22:04


Fuck your mother if you want fuck!

From the start in January 2009, how long did it take to execute 50 Eh?
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:15:40
Or he spends a lot of time in this sub.
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:17:01
I'm sorry to let you know this can only be fixed with much higher bitcoin prices. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 05:07:34
When central banks start to think about owning bitcoin as reserves they are already obselete. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 05:05:41
I'd guess somewhere in 2021
@_date: 2018-10-20 17:21:08
Expensive but important lesson that greed can be blinding and that due diligence is important.
Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 12:48:14
What's wrong with that? 
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:07:24

Sell now. Buy back in a year. Thank me later. Bear markets can be really long and painful. It's all the wifes causing it. The negging will become unbearable (pun intended). 
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:25:39
Too early

It's high risk for the person who will try to double spend, because they can end up buying your product.
How high this risk is, I don't know, because I don't know what percentage of hash rate will include the first transaction versus including the transaction with the highest fee. Some miners are idealistic with regard to this and some miners are profit seeking. A website like [chain.so]( might give you a clue, but I don't know how precize their estimates are.
Personally I'd be asking myself what amount I'd be willing to lose and accept 0-confs up until that amount and just implement it. If you get double spent you can always stop accepting 0-confs.
It would be cool if you can track failed double spend attacks too.
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:48:42
Adoption though
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:52:56
The cost involved with double spend is the risk that the first transaction will be confirmed. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:17:18
It depends on the size of the transaction. You can safely do so up to a certain amount, since there is a risk involved, but the risk is quite small. Also, is there instant delivery of the product (like access to software) or do you ship the product later so you can check if the transaction was really confirmed.
Also lightning transactions are instant.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:21:11
He didn't blame Assange.
@_date: 2019-04-17 05:54:22
Because I'll sell for 999.999 and the next guy for 999.998 etc.

Bitcoin has not gotten more volatile. Peak volatility in the 2013 bubble was much higher than the 2017 bubble. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:10:43


They might offer it as a service to attract costumers as long as it's not a regulatory hazard. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:15:23
In the I don't want to get my ass kicked by law enforcement for money laundering business. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:09:48
Markets change, especially when bitcoin grows up and gets less volatile.
Then again, it could still happen. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:11:13
Does that mean we're due for a bigger one again? 
@_date: 2018-07-04 04:59:06
Ther are only 24 x 2048 = 49152 combinations you need to try. Good luck.

How can they do this trustless?

There is actually no proof that this is real. It was probably made by someone else, not The Economist.
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:27:29
I like both

Historically, inflation has always meant, the inflation of the money supply and rising prices are just a result of it.
You don't inflate prices, you inflate the money supply and prices rise.
@_date: 2018-12-25 05:51:08


Yes there is plenty of reason. Both the economy and the stock market are in a huge bubble because of cheap credit and low interest rates.
It's very damaging for the economy what the FED has done, but they and many people don't understand this.
The world needs a paradigm change. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:03:00
What about stocks
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:25:05
Miners can buy futures to lock in their profits and the future supply is already known. Also each consecutive halving, inflation will not shrink as much as the last one.
I'm not so certain we'll have a massive bullrun so soon after the last one.
