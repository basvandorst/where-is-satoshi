The things you spelled out are already possible in today's implementations.
If you want to store some bitcoins without them being tied to you on the spending end, you can just as well change the one address you've given the exchange via 2FA etc.

What a cave dweller that MtGox CEO is.
No matter whether he could give the protester his Bitcoins, the first thing he should have done after hearing that he has flown 12 hours to be there, is to invite him in, buy him a coffee and disarm his anger. 
Then explain whatever (e.g.that they are having problems and don't have the manpower to give everyone their BTC manually and that they don't want to set a precedent, etc.)

Easily digestible content is easy to digest. That's no one's fault.
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:20:01
Jeez... ok I'm gonna spell it out:
You put in your one address to which you want to receive Bitcoins, they store a salted hash. 
Everytime you want to actually receive Bitcoins, **you put in that same address** and they check against the hash. If it works out, they send you the coins.
This way, if the exchange was to be hacked, they would not have the people's addresses and couldn't follow them on the blockchain.
I really expected to be able to rub two brain cells together before downvoting something that may not be obvious.

They could easily take down all exchanges which would cripple the Bitcoin economy for a while, but not kill it completely. People would come up with a decentralized exchange that can't be taken down.

A single bitcoin does not exist as a digital entity.
You only have "stacks" of bitcoins which can have any amount of bitcoins on them and they can send and receive bitcoins and can also be collectively stored in a "wallet".
E.g. if bitcoins were digital entities, they would need to each be represented as some cryptographic string, but that means they're indivisible so you'd need one string per satoshi which quickly consumes a lot of space.
But instead you have a cryptographic string per "coin stack" and each stack can have any positive number (incl. zero) of satoshis on it.

A hash is a smaller number that is calculated from a larger number. It is used to identify the larger number while using less space.
Text can be represented as a number.
Hashing algorithms, like SHA, will always generate the same hash from the same text, but if you even change just one letter of the text, the generated hash will be entirely different.
Miners take a hash of the transactions and use that as input for another round of hashing, but this time they add a random number and they do this very often, until the resulting hash has ~12 leading zeroes.
There's no way to predict what random number added to the first hash will result in a hash that starts with zeroes, so they have to try out many numbers (that's why it takes so much time and computing power).
Once they find that random number, they "have mined a block" and their block gets added to the blockchain, which means the transactions that are in this block get verified.
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:17:31
That's a good point. Maybe you could hide it form the user. e.g. make the button and the ring surrounding it both from metal and hook them up to a voltmeter, so when the user presses the button, you measure the conductivity of his skin and use it as added entropy.
edit: also measuring the soundlevel in the room, the humidity and air pressure are hidden as well

I'm not sure whether I've understood it correctly.
So the new client 0.8.1. says that it'll use a new protocol on may 15th and if anyone by that time is still using 0.7., the blockchain will fork (I assume it's similar to forking on version control for code).
So what if some people remain on 0.7. but also some miners do and produce new blocks that differ from the mainstream 0.8.x blocks? Will it be possible to send money to people on the mainstream branch from the "old" branch?
