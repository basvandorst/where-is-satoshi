Common sense is useless with cops. You never know that you didn't do anything wrong, because you can't possibly know enough law. You got LUCKY to talk to cops who didn't arbitrarily decide that you had committed it just to wrap it up with the first random person they can pin the guilt on.

About EDIT 2:
That's only for people who had outstanding transactions at those prices. For everyone who wasn't trading at that time, or at those precise price points, their money is safe.

Dunno for the scalability of one server, but if you just could build-in viral replication across all servers... with a DHT that indexes orders...
so you'd have like
clients[1...n] &lt;-&gt; brokers[1...n] &lt;-&gt; rev5[stores orderbook in DHT]
* client privacy can be guarded (somewhat)
* brokers will have to comply with local regulations until those become as unenforceable as copyright is as of right now
* all the rev5 servers should cooperate for the tons of reasons that become obvious as soon as you think about it
The p2pox project has an idea for zero-trust transaction verification, maybe it's worth reading : 
I would like to not see any answer to this that talks about Ripple. Ripple demands that you trust a closed-source system with "real-world" investors =&gt; single point of failure, technical and legal/regulatory =&gt; FAIL.
I *just know* that no exchange can be relied on until the regulations become unenforceable. "They" *just gave up* on copyright. Now we will force them to *just give up* on "unlicensed financial activities".
Oh, sure, they'll try and catch some dozen people... out of the "all of the Internet" that will be using bitcoin, just like some filesharers got caught until the system gave up.
Later, when we'll have smart assurance contracts defined in Bitcoin iself, we'll crowd-fund/vote everything and get rid of "elected officials" because we'll be funding the things to be done instead of voting for idiots in rigged popularity contests.

I can assure you that cops have no concept of "witness" or "victim". All cops know is "Guilty" and "chief". You're not a cop's superior, you're guilty of *some*thing.
