So is this it? Sell when you start hearing your average joe talking about it? That’s when you know to sell in a bubble.

What GPUs are you running? At a modest $400 per, that is over $14k in gpus alone, add psu, mobos, etc and you're damn well near 20k. Oh and 36 gpus running 24/7 hydro bill? This does not sound more efficient than running a furnace by any means.

Huh? If you’re insinuating there is more to Bitcoin than just the price, then wtf is this post?

Honestly, I want another euphoric bull run like everyone else, but realistically how many times can this keep happening? The last bubble had quite the global impact, everyone was talking about Bitcoin. Problem is they all witnessed and some even experienced the collapse.
Part of me believes too much damage was done this time around and there just won’t be enough interest/belief this time around to carry something even remotely close to the bull runs we’re used to.

Earliest recorded price is incorrect, its one pizza.

People know about Bitcoin. Tweeting it to everyone on earth aint gonna change a damn thing.

I know A LOT more people that either lost money investing in Bitcoin or were scammed trying to invest in Bitcoin than people that never stuck their toes in yet.
I feel too many everyday normal guys were burned on this last run and the damage can’t be undone.

This just in, China bans surveys.

Nobody cares about any news out of China, they're a nothing burger now when it comes to crypto.

You saying this like the alts have seen nothing yet, but where do you think all this btc pump money is coming from and where do you think if this etf fails? Literally 90% of the money from alts into BTC can sell and buy back into their alts at massive gains already, and they will.

Because it had volume and was going to make them more money, that's all any of these exchanges care about is more money. So technically it's not these exchanges fault, its all the traders that bought and sold it. It was supposed to be a dumpathon into single digits, even cents, but nope, traders gonna trade right?

This is not a bubble, this is not a bubble, this is a bubble

Worldwide debt tends to increase in parallel with population, I mean why wouldn't it. Irrelevant cherry picked stat.

Everyone avoiding the obvious, trust issues with tether and Bitfinex. People buying coins and getting out of tether and Bitfinex.
