 one of the world's most trusted cell phone unlocking sites is now offering Bitcoin as a new payment method! We are very excited about this offering and feel that this will benefit many users.
We opened our virtual doors in 2009 and have since unlocked over 80,000 devices. We have always offered PayPal as a payment option, and TrialPay as our 'get it free' (advertising-subsidized) option, but we recognize that not every customer has PayPal and that TrialPay is not available in every region... Bitcoin fills that gap (plus, it's awesome)!
Our codes are all 100% genuine, remote unlocking codes. No software is needed to unlock your device with us. Simply enter the code into your device, and it'll be permanently unlocked without voiding any warranty.
It effectively pays for itself! The resale value of your device can increase up to 300%; you will save money when you travel by not having to pay for roaming (you can buy a local SIM!); or you can even change network providers! Plus, you'll never know when you'll need your phone unlocked, so best be prepared!
You can read a few of the (many) honest reviews about us here:  and here:  and here  Suffice it to say, we know what we are doing in the unlocking-sphere Wink
Please don't hesitate to contact us at  if you have any queries!
Happy unlocking and Bitcoining (hopefully together at FreeUnlocks.com)!

Hi there,
If you use TrialPay's "get it free" option (as more than 50% of our customers do), then it is truly free. TrialPay's advertisers subsidize the code so you don't have to pay. You can read about this here: 
(TrialPay is a multi-million dollar company, partly owned by Visa! We simply use then as our 'alternative payment' gateway). 
We recognize that some people simply prefer to pay, hence Bitcoin. Our 'buy now' rates are extremely competitive and we truly offer first-class support. You won't get that anywhere else either (let alone the prices we offer)
Hope that helps!

Most of the WOT ratings are by those who are confused by the 'get it free' option. I don't think that justifies a negative rating, but who am I to argue. Please read my comment above to see how it is truly free with TrialPay (a company partly owned by Visa). Regardless of your 'opinion' on TrialPay, our core service is 100% trustworthy, as proven by those 3 review links above (and feel free to search forums worldwide to find other reviews). All I'll say about WOT is to read comments if people have left any, as I'm not sure where they come from. We pride ourself in our offering, support, prices, TrialPay alternative, and 99% success rate on the codes (and we always refund if it didn't work out).
