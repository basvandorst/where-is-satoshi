Why *not*?

Yeah. This sounds good.

Definitely. Try opening your wallet once a day for a week before depending on memory of passwords!

Your mother loves you, and proof of that is the fact that she even got you a Christmas gift. Remember that holidays are a blessing, and that you should be happy to receive any kind of gift. Remember who raised you and where you came from so that you can be thankful that you have your mom.
As for getting bitcoins, you should look for someone who is tech-savvy to help you get some. There are a lot of resources online. Maybe get some friends to help you?
Anyway, you should probably apologize to your mom and thank her for her gift. You will be much happier. Good luck!

Thanks. Good luck with things, and I hope you have a better year!

I would pay attention to what happens in China. I think what will cause bitcoins to rise swiftly is if and when the Chinese are able to put money into the exchanges again. Otherwise, my personal gut tells me that it should go up slightly.

Yeah, bitcoin would be much more stable if it were in the hands of countries with less regulation (at least, less inclined to drop due to fear). But the reality is that the Chinese have a lot of bitcoins right now, and any news regarding their ability to buy/sell will definitely have an impact. Hopefully we will hear good news soon so that prices will go up again and alleviate any fears. Otherwise, it might take some time for prices to climb back up.
