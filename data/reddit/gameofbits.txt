What I really want is a service that drops off an Azimo at my parents house and then my face appears on it.  I can then walk around and converse with people as if I were there.

Perception is reality, and until 99.9% of people believe price doesn't matter then price DOES matter.  This is all the general pop care about, "oh look at the price!" "oh bitcoin is dead!" "how's that bitcoin workin out for ya!" "bitcoin experiment fails" "bitcoin is done".  Yeah price doesn't matter... yeah all the 1,000's of headlines focused on price will have no effect on how the world perceives bitcoin..

Too big too fail, or should I say too powerful a military to fail.

Well, I've had over 100 domain names on godaddy for over 12 years and never had a single issue (knock on wood).  My domains are locked, very complex password, 2FA and I try to keep my business laptop that accesses godaddy extremely secure.  I intend to switch to google's domain service as soon as it's available internationally.

Well, if the hard drive is compromised and spy apps installed into the firmware, I would suspect everything you type can be keylogged or screengrabbed and sent to the spies.  They can see what you see, what you type, even watch you via your webcam.

Try setting up a business banking account (In New Zealand), this took me over a week and the hoops I had to jump through were insane.  Bitcoin would have done this in 3 seconds.  I actually said this to them and explained that what I had to go through was ridiculous and they're dead men walking.

Encryption is useless, we now know hard drive firmware and likely other firmwares contain hidden spyware.  They will simply grab your data before it's encrypted or right after it's decrypted on your side.

Because Visa etc are so damn worried about BTC that they are forcing other companies to ban BTC.  What does this say to you?
