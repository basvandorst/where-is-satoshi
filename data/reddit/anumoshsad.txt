Truth spoken.

I don't think people will earn much from arbitrage. It's a free market and if there is any arbitrage the price will adjust accordingly.

I don't understand why coinbase can't verify your identity. They are having millions of customer everyday. Don't be shady, and they can verify your identity.

cmc fud campaign continues....
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:42:14
If I send my payment with ridiculous high fees and have to wait days for confirmation in which time the value of my payment is already changed because of crypto price volatility, then why on *king earth any merchant would choose that payment system?? Don't need to be an einstein to answer this question. 
If LN doesn't come in the next 1-2 months, this type of news will keep coming.

Are you buying now to cost average?
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:52:17
Which cave do you live in, brother? It's one week old news and for cryptos, one week is equivalent to 1yr of our lifetime...lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:58:38
Just wondering how many digits in your initial investment? I also invested around the same time, but not that much profit.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:27:10
Possible if US govt shut it down and after one year make it legal again.... you never know. Wait and see lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:00:10
Exactly what I was asking to myself. 
We need a timeline. At least the core team should give a tentative schedule. New investors are losing patience.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:27:57
Nobody knows what will happen. You can sell now. Or just HODL. Once this 'shorting' FUD is gone, the price will rise definitely. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:01:48
From the title I thought someone committed suicide for bitcoin.... thanks god...lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:33:16
Get ready for 15k. My prediction is 20k in january 2018. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:16:22
You should buy more. If you don't know this, you should not have entered into this. If it is a dip, buy. Otherwise HODL. If you have enough profit and wanna get out, then leave. Now you figure out what you wanna do.

We are already in the correction. But not bitcoin, usd is correcting its value against btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:44:01
We are always in the dip. BTC could be worth 100k soon.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:22:16
Exactly what I was gonna write. IT IS THE CORRECTION BOYS! This won't stop until btc hits 1 million. So get as much as you can.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:30:55
I am seeing 15k before any shaking up off weak hands. Nobody is willing to sell now. Thats why this rise is going on. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:42:19
PURE GREED!!!! lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:48:13
But gemini doesn't have any other coins which coinbase doesn't. I am primarily interested in other altcoins which I can buy directly with fiat in ny state.
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:11:03
you mean: "erection upward coming bigly"??
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:44:01
buy high sell low... lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:05:49
We are already in dip. Bitcoin should be 25k now. Just buy buy buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:25:19
Although it's not a good idea to ask reddit for investment advice, I can only say don't even think of selling. Just HODL.

u mean Amedhar card? :p
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:38:28
Bitcoin be like: "been there, done that". Media is killing bitcoin every 2 months, am I right? Or may be every few weeks. But here we are now! 10k is an important psychological barrier which is overcome. I won't be surprised if bitcoin hits 15k within december. Remember? Someone named Satoshi fixed the total number of bitcoin at *ONLY 21MILLION!* So get your portion while you can.

Also try gdax, it's coinbase' own exchange with much much less fees.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:50:48
sell and be rich.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:15:40
seems like coinbase is accessible to you, so why don't you use their exchange gdax? .25% or zero fees. google/youtube to find out how. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:11:01
Then just sell and get out of the market. Nobody is holding you bro. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:29:51
Move it out of coinbase wallet or Sell it quick and send the cash to your bank. And don't pay them even if they contact you. Let them taste their own medicine lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:41:30
why use coinbase? So many times, again and again, coinbase is fucking our arsehole and we are just complaining. If you dont have any other options, just use their exhange gdax which works fine most of the time.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:19:04
FUCK CHINA and FUCK OLLY!
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:12:18
Just joking man. Of course he should not do it. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:32:41
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:34:03
Did you ever wonder where your lost 2 btc went?? lol.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:08:10
Then for god's sake, use GDAX. You can also do ACH transfer to gdax, and it has low fees, less trouble than coinbase. Just DON'T USE COINBASE and get them out of their business of fucking customer's arseholes. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:40:11
