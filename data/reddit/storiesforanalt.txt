Lol, the number 2 coin has government laws being written on top of its blockchain. Number 3 is working with the IMF and Bitcoin is the only coin in the game ��? Just like Internet explore has its firefox and chrome counter part, so will BTC.

After you get situated can you please elaborate on how this happened?
Thanks and best of luck

I love these post because people haven’t taken the slightest amount time to really think about what a wealthy life would be like. Most want to quit their jobs but then what? You have an ENTIRE life to fill with something to do.

The problem is the voting system - that shit is decades old and needs a 2.0 overhaul. But do you honestly think the people in charge want to pass that power to logical people who have everyones best interest at heart? Nope and do you think they’ll ever make it easy to do so? You want change? Be prepared to bleed for it or have massive amounts of money because its the only way it’ll ever happen. Ask the Black people how that worked out for them. *drops �� *

How likely is it for an America to move there?

Sorry to say this but you’re feeding yourself bs - hold yo damn bitcoin and use any funds from here on out to change your situation. 
One, I repeat, ONE billionaire is trying to own 25% of the supply of bitcoin. Can you imagine what the other rich people are doing in the background? 
If you really want a suggestion, go into the military. Youll have a place to live, you can get an education, an income and you wont have to sell your bitcoin. Dont do shit in life you’ll regret - that feeling will haunt you for a good while.

I absolutely agree but man, I honestly don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have to work a 9 - 5. Ive had 6 months off between jobs before and gaming all day got old real quick. Now granted there are things that I could do if I wasn’t being frugal but being rich, especially by yourself, seems like it might be a whole new can of worms.

Ledger Nano S in cold storage and purchase from their main site for 50 bucks unless they raised the price. I don’t remember the name of the desktop wallets I used to use unfortunately so I can’t say. But cold storage is the way to go. 
Theres a reason binance holds 90% of their assets in cold storage.

Man that was fun - I used to put my hands in the air and then move with the roller coaster.

My rebuttal to this - at the age of 60, will you remember your ssn? Memory shouldn’t be the only source which he isn’t doing, so kudos to him.

But how is that a phishing scheme? If its a legit wallet, which I’m assuming it is, and you were prompted to update the wallet before moving the coins, how could you know that you installed malware on your comp? 
Did the prompt come from the wallet? Or was it an attack through your email?
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:27:57
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:27:36
Yikes! Attackers should not be able to reach you through the application you hold your coins at. Please dump that trash wallet asap!!
Edit: being attacked via your crypto wallet is like having a bank account that can be fished for funds. If this was the case, you wouldn’t hold your money in that bank and the only difference between the two is that one can insure your money.
The fact that its been patched is good but to have been exposed to that in the first place, especially since the wallet doesn’t insure your crypto, would be enough for me to be seeking alternatives. Better safe than sorry mate.

If I wanted to sell my 401k to invest in bitcoin, Id have to pay taxes to cash out to fiat and then AGAIN after exiting crypto. Uncle sam is greedy as fuck.

The pump from 20 dollars to 100 begs to differ

Brah, someone WILL find you - there was a guy who posted his cash out of btc. Not long after, they broke into his place and beat the crap out of him for those coins. DELETE THIS FOR YOUR SAFTEY.

I know tone is hard to pinpoint online but I don’t mean this in a negative way. Even if people become millionaires from this, not knowing how to get your money to make you more money will result in this same situation. I hope people learn from this so they don’t go back to being broke after crossing that bridge.

Lol, I love how it battles for the number 2 spot with ether and more often gets left out of the party

I guess Jed McCaleb shouldnt have tired dumping a million xrp on the exchange in one day after signing a contract with Ripple to dump no more than 10,000 a week. You should also inform op that coins stored off of a gateway/exchange cant be frozen. 
Its not controlled by banks, the coin is “used” by banks as the primary use case to move money across borders which currently takes a lot of time vs the 4 seconds that xrp does this in. You know all those 50 and 70 dollar fees people pay to send money to other countries with western union or wire transfers, well xrp will be able to do that for pennies.
Op, do your own research or youll find your self making decisions off shit advice and half truths. 
TLDR - do your OWN RESEARCH

Stop printing money...thats how you fix it
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:54:57
Like why didn’t you buy some when it was 4 or 5k?
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:33:49
While accurate I think the bigger issue is hearing the big players bash crypto but then buying that same asset behind close doors
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:47:26
Coinbase using USDC since someone mentioned it was free...
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:59:26
Dont worry, crypto and blockchain will solve this issue in a couple of years
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:02:45
Thats a very expensive fee when we have the tech to being doing this for pennies.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:16:32
Or simply wait for decentralized exchanges and then not care while the government sets laws to reach their greedy ass hands into your pockets
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:54:11
Except they do and will. For those living in America, this is why Binance is ending trading on their main platform and making a “US” version just for US citizens - to report every trade that is done.
The only way you can safely never pay uncle sam is by never cashing out or moving to a tax free country and trade there.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:00:37
If for example you bought your crypto in the us, moved and set up all the havens in other countries before cashing out, by US law, you owe them money because you went into crypto before leaving the US. 
Im betting every country has different laws so you’d have to research each and everyone.

Except we already had another moon shot to 13k... its already happened again ��
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:01:07
Tell that to the whale who wanted to own 25% of the 21million coins over in Europe. Tell that to the NY stock exchange. Tell that to the German Banks who now can hold, buy or sell said asset. Remember when the price of btc was 3500 and no one was “buying”? And do you remember before that when there was all that talk about institutions getting involved? 
Yeah, all that has happened and we’re sitting on a 7k coin which is the same price it was before the 2018 bull run.
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:03:36
The price will pump well before that date.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:29:20
Sorry, you forgot to pay capital gains, we’ll be taking all your coins and you now owe us btc �� - uncle sam
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:48:39
Its just funny how the crypto space treats the reward being cut in half. Logically, the value of bitcoin should slowly increase after the event but instead, we get huge spikes normally before and after the fact.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:55:33
Haha, love it!
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:19:39
If 3500 to 13,000 isn’t “to the moon”, then I don’t know what is.
@_date: 2019-12-06 23:03:41
Wait long enough and you won’t have to go anywhere. Banks are getting on board with the storage and safe keeping of digital assets - just take a look at Germany.
@_date: 2019-12-23 19:49:59
Exactly with the 401k - I’m dumping mine into btc the second i get it moved.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:55:07
See but thats why you should continue to mine. Yes, the reward is cut in half and your making less on the front end but at the same time the value of the coin will eventually reflect the limited supply. 
If I was a miner, I wouldn’t shut down my machines unless I couldn’t afford the electric bill. Once btc spikes, dump a decent amount of the mined btc and continue operations. 
And if I was taking this seriously, I would also build a solar powered btc farm to cut down on that electric bill. Maybe I need to get on this ... haha
@_date: 2019-12-06 23:08:20
Haha ��, too good.
