No, this is the bitcoin core. The bitcoin core just connects your computer to the entire bitcoin block chain allowing you to make the currency more secure (though it is nominal boost in security). However, I do have the corner of my mining program showing in this picture. Mining bitcoin with regular PC components isn't profitable in the least bit today but, mining alt-coins such as litecoin or in my case: ethereum is moderately profitable. I'm using an AMD RX 480 and in the past two weeks I have earned around $20. In my area power cost is very low (about $.07/Kwh) and the graphics card I use is very power efficient thus making mining atl-coins very profitable. Here's a link to get started if you're considering it:  After mining and receiving my coin I using shape shift  to transfer my alt-coin into bitcoin (or vise-versa in bitcoins recent decline). 
Hope this helped clear some stuff up for you and get you on your way to make a few extra bucks with your PC.

My computer is just now apart of the block chain, nothing to help with. I was just posting this to r/bitcoin to show I'm helping the currency out.

Never heard of Exodus or Changelly.com? Because Exodus is very new to the Bitcoin scene.

Ok, thanks a lot for the info I have looked into Minergate and it seemed a little too fishy and since they're associated with each other I will stay fully away from both. Is there any Bitcoin buying websites that you would recommend for a newbie like me to use?
