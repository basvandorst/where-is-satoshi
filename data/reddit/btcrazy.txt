Nice! Thanks for responding; this makes perfect sense. 
Only other question. Would it be possible that an infected computer might seize control of the wallet once the PIN is entered? That's my only fear. Other than that, looks like I'm picking one of these up for Christmas.
OH and how would someone transfer paper wallet to the Nano?
Thanks again :)

It had a sharp sharp sharp sharp drop! Like, sharper than I've ever seen (Well, not since Jan 2014... we all know what happened. And i don't watch the charts often, so there may have been steeper.).
I saw 15.5K hit, minutes later, steady at 16.5K.
I actually NEEDED that steep drop to prove to myself that there's enough support, investors waiting to get onboard.
Because back in the day if the price dropped 5% it would go to 15% really fast (source needed). I think it's because confidence was lacking in this newfound digital currency. According to HODLers back then, a steep drop could mean the end of Bitcoin forever. Certainly was the case for me. "I got in the game expecting to lose my investment. I guess that's what I'm watching now." That mindset sure has changed over the years (Well, since 2014 not that long ago lol!)
These steep drops shed the SODLers (certainly not soldiers). For every steep drop, there are a few new HODLers who jump on the train. I welcome them aboard!!! 
However this party is not done yet. Still more action to see. 
Every night I go to sleep not knowing what the hell price I will wake up to.

My wife tells me to high five you. Founders is her favorite. You ever had Blushing Monk? We nearly go broke when those are in stock. At $17-20 per 750ml bottle. One of the only beers my wife drinks. Despite the high price... that's about as high as a typical craft beer goes, and that would still be considered cheap compared to high quality wines!

My thoughts (others might have better advice)
Once you get the coins extracted, put them in a cold storage wallet.
It will be worth it to buy a new cheap laptop, format it, disable network connection, and put your wallet in there. Make sure to back it up on several external hard drives. Worth it to buy a small Smith Wesson safe. Encrypt them with a password that you WILL remember. Don't write the PW down anywhere. Look up mnemonics. Don't use "correct horse battery staple" but something like it. 
Never expose your wallets to the internet until Morpheus brings us into the world where we can buy everything with Bitcoin
Finally, welcome to the ~42 million club :-)
**Plot twist** Father mis-remembered, and he really has 100 btc in there. The wallet is locked. Some basic research shows that he used "hunter2" as his password. Family goes on permanent vacation.

Seriously! It does not take much 'research' to understand that something you possess is well-desired by many. Hell, even a person given a very old, vintage, collector's beanie baby would likely jump to research how much it's valued now.
But the key difference, I think, is that digital Bitcoin are still intangible to many. I must agree, it's a tough concept to wrap your head around if you are not remotely technically inclined. "It's a ... series of letters and numbers? And it's worth more than ten grand? And the humans, they want these numbers?"

This makes me think of ... well, brand hubs. An organization acting on behalf of many third parties. "Our network supports purchases at these locations". For example Yum Brands (pizza hut/taco bell) could have a LN for all of their stores, right?
Or consider a large mall with 400 shops - it could have an LN for all shops within? It seems that once this is architected, it'll be highly effective and convenient to send funds only to a few channels to unlock a huge majority of commerce.
I am really liking where Bitcoins future is going :)
What's preventing people from spamming the main chain though? Anyone can initiate a transaction to bog down the network... is this a liability even if LN is in place? (And I realize it might even be a liability right now, but I haven't seen talk of it)
Thanks for putting it all so clearly. I understand better as well :)

Or do I got it all wrong? Seems less of a financial investment and more like a game of cards.
My question is ... if someone is so sure Bitcoin is going to increase, why do they play in this little game and not just buy Bitcoin outright ... ?....  Oh... I think I just figured it out. DUH! They don't pay up right away. They promise to pay if they lose. So they STILL invest in BTC AND promise they'll pay up if BTC goes down. So if/when it goes up... they not only win the other person's funds, but they also win on the amount of BTC they had invested? A double whammislam?

I don't understand. I appeal to cryptocurrency as a macro concept, rather than individual communities as a micro concept. Yes, I have my opinions regarding each one, but I am taking a subjective stance opposed to an objective one. 
Cryptocurrency [as a whole] represents a future ideal. If I were to say "this coin is shit" I am thus attempting to stifle a small population's voice. Fuck that, dude. Give anyone who believes in cryptocurrency a voice! Doesn't matter if they share your digital investment, let them cry out against the bankers, the 1%, the Wall Street snort-coke-off-lambos-while-fucking-wives-of-blue-collar-hard-workers, whatever.
I don't give a fuck what you say. I stand for crypto in the form of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, Bcash, Dash, Monero, ... fuck, even Dogecoin and Potcoin!

"for every billion dollars that goes into crypto there's a 25 billion dollar price appreciation"
I'm not too good at advanced math, but there's a population of about 325 million in the US. So let's say 100 million invest $100 in cryptocurrency. Multiply that amount by the hypothetical 25x price appreciation, we come up with this number:
$250,000,000,000 (250 billion)
That' would be *added* to the market... That would be hypothetically more than 50% increase on the total market cap today, up to about 650B. 
Now what about if all of the money that was in the market in January 2018 returns, added alongside the money entering in based on OP's idea? We'd be getting close to a $1Trillion market.
Hypothetically...of course.

But what about those who literally have to cash out to pay taxes on gains made which are more than one could afford with fiat? Most governments don't yet accept crypto, so when you report that your HODLing gains warrant $10K in taxes or whatever, they'll expect it from you.
(That's what I learned in another thread made by a crypto tax assistant). In my personal opinion, you can cash out to pay taxes and still be a HODLer. But this kinda contradicts your "for any reason".

You touch on a point that I (and perhaps others) have been theorizing for awhile. The tech will grow. There will always be more alt-coins. Hell, there will be alt coins that perhaps outperform bitcoin in niche areas. HOWEVER, BitCoin is that vanity asset. Loosely compared to BRK-A stock. I can see a lot of investors/richierich folk wanting to own "one whole Bitcoin" just for the sake of holding ONE. And that is when the investor rush happens. Every investor clammoring for ONE, as a vanity asset – the pioneer to cryptocurrency. 
I read this thing, if every millionaire in the world wanted 1 bitcoin, there would be not much to go around at all. (source / math needed). I think we can still see that happen, maybe. That's why I do NOT think bitcoin is gonna relenquish  position for a long while.

I gotta look this one up! It's been awhile since I've been keeping up with the developments (which requires learning something new every day). The first thought that came to mind is a unified hub that automatically divides assets between various coins automatically as needed? That would be awesome. Allow people to stop obsessing about the price per every different coin and focus on, "Okay this coin performs X, and this one performs Y, and this one performs 42 and half a pi. So I will use X coin."  Now time to look what it actually does :-P

When Bitcoin Cash came out around $250 I thought, "Meh. Not worth enough to sell. I'll sell if it goes up." It went up to $800. "Wow! I'm gonna hold on, don't wanna sell if it keeps going up!" Went down to 300. "Should have sold. stupid stupid stupid me! I'll sell if it gets up to 700." wake up, see it is 1200. "NOT SELLING!"

Encouraging someone to buy a small amount of Bitcoin is a very smart move. "Just $25, just for fun, just to say you have some bitcoin." Because, once you're in, it gets a lot easier to buy more. So many are still fixated on this "OMG I want 1 coin, anything less than that is practically nothing." So investing small, 'just for fun' is a great way to give people the 'Bitcoin Bug'. Because once you buy $25, it's easier to do more and more small purchases. And then a few years later, you might be a part of the 21M club!
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:32:20
1% of world currency seems like a lot, but I may have the perspective off. 
I like to compare BTC to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway A stock. About $250,000 per share. It was only a few thousand not too long ago. (Well, like 20 years). If BTC was $250K in 11 years, I think it would be doing very good :)
TLDR: If Bitcoin was like BRK-A, a vanity asset with practical use,  then moon would be had.
EDIT: Okay so I can't base my comparison on share price. I have to base it on Market Cap:
$461.16B = BRKA market cap. Bitcoin is $118B,
Therefore, if Bitcoin matches BRKA then we're at $27,000. VERY similar to the figure you responded with, 1%!
The numbers don't lie! :-D
And imagine how many MORE uses BTC has over BRKA. Seriously.... We should be considering matching BRKA's value as BASELINE...

I've been imagining a future where people wear bands, and that's their hot wallet balance. The bands also have their profile data, so when they pass common public checkpoints, their bands are automatically scanned and their location timestamp is logged for tracking. There are no cash registers. People buy what they want and the balance is deducted from their wallet as soon as they leave the store. If their balance is insufficient, they're flagged at the next checkpoint and their profile data is seized until they restore the balance. Muggers would have to require the victim to unlock the wallet for transfer by inputting a series of commands into the band and then when the authorization verification screen displays, holding the band to to their head so the band detects their brain's unique electro-signal. 
UPDATE: This reminds me of my other vision of the future: Integrated Processing &amp; Computation. Imagine office buildings whose walls *are* computers. Each sheet of wall is an IPC panel and attaches to the core. These panels are like add-on processing power. Larger buildings can have more powerful computation. This allows major corporations to verify transactions on the blockchain. However, the bitcoin foundation found out how to use the mining &amp; transaction verifying to the benefit of genome research by funneling the computation power through a third party and solving for random genome DNA sequences through the number output. This allows for DNA combinations never before discovered to trigger a notification when a new significant potential sequence is found, such as a cure for Parkinson's. However I don't know much about how DNA works to go into more detail, but coin mining/computing could also go to benefit other organizations that need cloud based computation.

When I saw someone post a screenshot of the very first BTC faucet of 5 each, I had a flashback, "Holy crap, I swear I used that site for fun back then!" Yet I have no practical memory of ever doing anything with the coins. Email history shows me talking about Bitcoin when I first learned about it in 2011, but I never remember collecting any. I think it would be comedic if I really did use the faucet a few times and the coins are lost forever, thus invisibly shrinking even more the Max Supply.
Makes me wonder this: Let's say there was verifiable proof that, "Yes, 50% of all coins generated thus far are hopefully lost." What would happen to the markets? One thing is for sure, the One Million Club entry fee would be lowered to 11.5!
EDIT: Did some Joogling and indeed there are findings that approx. 4 million coins are gone forever. Could be even more than that because there are sooooo many "cold coins" that haven't moved in many years. Fascinating.
But that doesn't suddenly make everyone else's coins more valuable, because I'm assuming the market already takes into consideration the lost coins?

Something's just so funny about the term "Mastering Bitcoin". 
It's like my in-law who became the household cryptocurrency expert because he set up his Coinbase account on auto-purchase. 
In my opinion, you're a Bitcoin master if you know how to transfer digital assets on a whim and do so securely as well as know the use case for a hot wallet and cold storage. It doesn't take much. As far as knowing when to buy and sell, you're a master in that department depending on how good you are at darts.

Goodness. That makes you think.
Let's say that overnight, Bitcoin became a Rich Man's Vanity Asset. Every millionaire wants one. The race that would ensue... the greed and manipulation and the effect on the market. Good lawdy... you don't even need tech innovation if you have the green of the rich. "Umm, rich people, you DO realize that it cost an arm and a leg to transfer?" "Doesn't matter! I can f'king afford it!" 
I think I have a new future prediction now. 
By 2022, Bitcoin will be the official Rich Person's Vanity Asset, and the AltCoins will fuel the tech innovation, decentralization, utility (one alt coin for each major market/niche/industry -- yet all coins working complementary as one). 
In 2022, Owning a Bitcoin (which is now worth more than 1 share of BRK-A) will be like owning an old classic car. It hogs gas mileage, and it doesn't go as fast, and it requires lots of repairs, but it's in high demand and has value.

Another SEO here. I feel we'd be effective in numbers by: 
* Search "Buy Bitcoin" into Google. 
* Then scrolling down to the very bottom. 
* Click "Send feedback". 
* Include screenshot, highlighting the buy.bitcoin site. 
* Write a heartfelt message about how you thought you were buying real Bitcoins but the ones you spent money on were fake.
* [Here's a screenshot of my submission](
Enough people do this, Google takes notice. Some pro-BTC dev decides to do something about it.
**After all, Google's  priority after profits is User Experience. If enough of us show them that they are promoting a negative user experience, they WILL act.**
EDIT: whatever you do, do NOT click the buy.bitcoin site and linger there because it gives them extra relevance. Instead, click on another legit/reputable site to show Google's algorithms that another site has more beneficial and relevant info (make sure to stay awhile on the other site, click through a few inner pages, at least stay 2-3 minutes)
And/Or you can click on to buy.bitcoin and click your back button IMMEDIATELY. That shows Google that site did not have what you need!
These ideas are easily crowdsourced! No SEO team needed :)

What if Satoshi, before he decided to depart from the project forever, set up a smart script to automatically cash out the ~1mil (or whatever) in 10 coin intervals at $100K or something like that. And what if he set the money gains to automatically deposit into major charities (like that Pineapple Fund guy). And the message he attaches to one of the transactions, "I'm hidden among you."
And then the moon turns into a bat signal.
OH, better one. What if he set the coins to automatically cash out at $10M each. And then the script takes the $10Trillion and sends it to the US Treasury, thus paying off all US' debt. The attached message?

I am excited because the more money into Bitcoin = the more money into crypto as a whole. There is some amazing technology blossoming – no, exploding! – out there, and the strength of Bitcoin is the strength of progress and forward momentum. Bitcoin will be the father coin for a long while to come, and everyone rests in the gentle breeze of its shadow. 
The wise form allegiances with many; the foolish take sides.

I first heard of Bitcoin in 2009. My techie friend told me to check out these "Byte Coin Talk Forums". Everyone was trading them freely, obsessing about the tech. It all went over my head. I forgot about it, dismissing it as some geeky fad.
2 years after that, I discovered them again. "Damn, it got huge! I should have join them... Ah man, I'm late." 
Repeat this a couple more times, until I decided to finally commit. I invested a safe amount as a form of "entertainment investment" expecting to lose it all. I still haven't lost it all! :)

This is a good sign of a blossoming future of pay-by-crypto! I say this because most of the "____ now accepts Bitcoin" thus far has been very tech-related. Beauty clinics is much closer to an "every day type of service".
I suspect that boob jobs and hair transplant clinics will adopt cryptocurrency as their own due to the anonymous nature of the coin.

Due to their frustration at being no-coiners, Trogdors initiate a campaign to buy Bitcoins and send them to a fake burn address to essentially destroy them forever.
For they are called the clan of Trogdor, the Burninators.

Makes me wonder – back in the day – what was considered dust in the early Bitcoin communities, and as a result how many thousands of Bitcoin are permadusted in neglected/forgotten wallets!
Could it be possible within a few decades that half of all Bitcoin are unaccounted for? 
(For example... people who pass on before their time whom did not set up a transfer of digital assets upon passing.)
It also reminds me of my friend who tells the tale of "not bothering with that 5 free BTC faucet because five meager coins weren't worth your time back then". Yea... Bitcoin has a metric shitton of dust floating around!

Please keep us updated. Perhaps if you locate an old computer but can't seem to progress any further in finding the wallet.dat, there may be other options. Fortunately due to BTC being in its infancy (well, even more infant than it is now that is) there aren't many places it can be. Which is good! I'm pretty confident you'll solve this one.
Don't give up though, it's well worth it for you to find the wallet!

So critics compare BTC to a "dot com bubble" yet, about twenty years later, we're seeing two-character .com domains sell for millions? Some "bubble" ;)

I am looking to buy btc and store long-term on a paper wallet (on a fresh OS install, disconnected from internet). All I need to save is the private key, and in the case of wanting to retrieve the funds that private key is all I need correct? I keep hearing about "wallet.dat" but I'm not sure were that comes into play.

I have invested so much time to research, I was led to believe armory was the best bet. Though there's quite a bit of difference in opinion about how best to cold store BTC ...
So when I generate on BitAddress, that series of characters (about 2x long as the public key) is the one I need to write down? 
Is there a way to generate it offline on my secure computer? 
I don't trust my daily use computer to generate an address on any website. (call me paranoid, but I think that's the safest thing to be when dealing with cryptocurrency)

I'm honestly starting to think with all these people saying, "Don't invest more than you're willing to lose," and "Prepare yourself if you lose it all," that we're about as convincing as a label on a cup of coffee -- "Caution! Contents May Be Hot."
Sure, we all want to sound reasonable and pass around solid advice, such as, "Be safe!" and "Don't invest everything!" In the end, however, we're all very much convinced Bitcoin is going to the top. That's why we're in this thing together. My new caution to friends has turned away from "Don't be risky," to "Enjoy the ride; don't let charts and graphs take over your life!"
SAFETY EDIT: I'm not saying don't be safe. I'm saying that people who are irresponsible with investments don't need Bitcoin to be irresponsible with investments. The smart people don't need to be told proper investing advice, and the dumb people will ignore proper investing advice. Perhaps we could call this, "Survival Of The *Bit*test"

Why ask us? It's supposed to be a personal decision. Hope you put some thought into it. 
All I'm trying to say is ... even if 35k turns into 350k, any decision is a stupid decision if there was no critical thinking or hard thought into the decision. 
Regardless, I wish I had that amount to invest because I would. Good luck, don't look back!

I have found stuff that has gone missing online by Googling all of my usernames I've ever used.
Pen+paper. Write EVERYTHING down. Usernames. Emails you've used. Games you played. Seriously, research the crap out of yourself online. You'll find digital footprints. Follow those. Keep favorites tabs. Organize them. Google all of them.
It may seem very random at first, but you'll find patterns of activity. This has personally helped me in the past. You'll also discover more about your past-self than you can remember. That will open up additional venues of data and research. You'll branch out and get an overwhelmind understanding of who you were vs who you are today. 
With that complete, you'll more skillfully think in the mind of "who I was 3-4 years ago". Become yourself. 
Sounds all mystical and shit, but it has worked for me.
Edit for additional data: Let's say you gain access to an account you forgot about, like a forum. Look in your sent+received messages. Look at people's usernames you talked with. That might bring up memories of what you were into at the time. Follow the rabbit holes, wherever they may lead.
Also, whatever is stressing you out right now, get away from it. Find somewhere quiet. Go on a walk and take breaks often. Stretch, drink water, meditate if you have to. You need to clear your mind of your present stress. If that stress exists in your head, it'll clog your ability to analyze the information and assess the situation.  I'll edit more on here as I think of more :) Good luck!

I've held tight to my 100 Bitcoin for a couple years now. I never knew the implications that owning 90 Bitcoin could possess so much buying power in 2013, much less the buying power my 80 Bitcoin will have in 2020! Really, I consider my 70 Bitcoin a secure foundation for the well-being of my eventual retirement when 60 Bitcoin could keep me well sustained for many years to come. I bought 50 in 2010 as a casual experiment, and it quickly grew to 40 because I couldn't stop investing. And now that having 30 Bitcoin is now considered 'heavily invested' in the market, I'm quite happy to sit on 20 Bitcoin and purchase more with fiat whenever I can. I tell my friends, "I bought 10 and I never looked back." 
I have 0 Bitcoin, and should have invested in 2013 when I had the chance.

I was about to say the exact same thing, then read your comment. 
"I'm seeing 10.61 on my little ticker thing here. Wow. I remember when it was 0.61. Sure hope this isn't a bubble."
Oh yea ... a bubble alright. Funny thing is, when BTC is in the $1,000's people will make fun of us. I think the cycle will keep repeating itself until the far outreaches of its value potential.

Actually it can be a video game reference. In the game Guild Wars 2, Bolt of Silk is a somewhat high-level item needed to craft rare armors, which then can be salvaged for a chance at 1-3 of one of the game's primary currencies - Globs of Ectoplasm.

I was going to make a post on here Jan 1 giving some 2014 predictions about the community. I've been putting together this list for the past month. 
While I may still make this post, I can say right now that one of the predictions was that a famous rapper will mention Bitcoin in his/her lyrics, and that will drive tremendous public interest. That may happen sooner than 2014!
