I have a same issue and the customer service is absoluetly useless. I sent a transfer multiple hours ago and have yet to receive a hash code to track the coin. I have made over 10 other transactions where I get the hash code within 10-20 mins at most but this time I have no hash code after hours and they are saying that "we need six confirmations to get the code and make the transfer." That is false information, I understand that they guys need six confirmations to complete a transfer but they do not need six confirmations to get a hash code to track the transfer as I was given one before multiple times and the point of the hash code is to TRACK THE CONFIRMATIONS. There's something wrong on their end to not give me a hash code. My transaction is even completed from GDAX to coinbase but its is stuck going from coin base to Binance. I've called customer service multiple times and they just now "sent an email" to a higher up to resolve the problem because they apparently do not have access phone calls. So the only people we can talk to are the most basic customer service reps who literally on the phone said "let me go to my coinbase account and see how you can get a hash code so I can lead you," I've been on coinbase and GDAX for only a month and a half and even I know how to check the hash code! These reps have absolutely no clue what is going on at all. All this while, MY MONEY is in limbo because of their fault. They need to get better infrastructure asap or they are going to lose a lot of customers.
