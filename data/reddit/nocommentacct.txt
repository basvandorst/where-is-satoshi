This has been my reason for being most excited about bitcoin since the beginning. Inflation is taxation without representation. Every gov in history has destroyed itself from this exact practice unless someone else destroyed it first.

Or we could wait until we get some fungibility and privacy before desperate acts of mainstream adoption
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:27:27
So if we doubled the block size right now can you tell me exactly what negative effects would come as a result? I can’t imagine anything happen except for fees going down and adoption going up. I understand why we don’t want huge blocks right now but 2x isn’t going to hurt a thing in my eyes.

You’re right it’s not very friendly at all but people adapt to what is necessary. It’s not easy to imagine how other countries in the world are as important as the US but when the only alternative to crypto is storing your wealth in a rapidly hyper inflating government controlled currency people can learn pretty quick.  It’s happening around the world right now and this is going to be huge whether we like it or not.

Okay I just read it and wonder how much weight they were putting into the recent loss of nodes at the time.  This was from Sept 2015. I'm not sure why but there was a huge spike loss of nodes right around the time this was written.  .500KB blocks started becoming common in July.  Even after reading that paper thoroughly I'm not sure where your 90% loss of nodes estimate came from. Going by that logic you should be terrified that the entire Bitcoin network would start using Segwit all at once.  Depending on exactly where you believe the bottleneck to be you're either looking at 4MB/block of bandwidth and memory or 2MB or storage space. You really think 90% of the people interested enough in BTC right now are going to stop running nodes?

Wow this was perfectly said. Without the ability to get in at the start they won't even consider.

Damn man I never really thought about it like that. I've always thought Gold \&gt; USD simply because of how much harder it is to inflate the supply of Gold and never looked hard enough to realize "intrinsic value" doesn't make much sense when describing metals either. Good point

It actually costs something to legally leave. You were born here by default. I agreed to absolutely nothing. The correct way to phrase it would be I didn't adamantly disagree enough to leave.

I actually joined the military and deployed a couple of times before I figured out what the fuck is going on. There was a moment where my view of the country pulled a complete 180.  It was javelin training day.  We were almost done with a year in afghanistan with hardly any combat at all.  One day they round up our entire battallion (over 350 people) and we are each trained to shoot these javelins. The missiles for those cost 80k each and we each shot two. I got paid a grand total of $ less than a single one of those the four years that I was in.  These things are done because if they don't spend the budget they supposedly lose it. The higher ups are in bed with the manufacturers of the useless shit so they approve ridiculous purchases and probably get kickbacks.  Absolutely everything is so fucking corrupt every single place you look if you look close enough.  
My entire point here is FUCK whatever the country spent on me... I dont want a god damn thing. I literally just want to be left alone. No one fucks with me. I dont fuck with anyone else.

Read up on hyperinflation. Money is something that's useful to be exchanged for goods.  They have to spend that trash the second they get it because it loses value by the day and prices double by the week. It's not free money. It's worthless paper. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:11:58
Okay cool I appreciate that. So basically everyone super bullish that has been borrowing BTC has been profiting like mad?
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:33:12
Maybe in some areas you're correct right now. Open source may not be the best model. But you have to realize what's at stake and how easy it is to get away with it. There is no doubt that there will be closed source software popping up until the end of bitcoin with the sole intention of stealing your money. If you're not able to review the code yourself just do a little bit of research or go with the core stuff. If cores open source stuff gets hacked your coins will be worthless in their proprietary wallet anyways. That being said I've talked to the creators and for the very little that it's worth I don't think they are malicious at all. They're just stuck with a very nice product that's hard to sell.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:30:38
It's all about plausible deniability at that point.  Your public address for those BTC you bought on coinbase will always have data linking it back to you being the purchaser.  Go to bitaddress.org.  See how it works.  Download the site offline, disconnect from the internet and create at address.  Save that private key with your life.  Send all your BTC to that public address.  At that point, there will still be a paper trial that says "EvanGRogers bought $x of BTC from Coinbase then sent the BTC to [some public BTC address].  Whether or not you are the one in control of that public address can't really ever be proven. Probably 99/100 times when someone buys BTC on coinbase and makes exactly one transaction all to a cold storage address it's going to be someone sending BTC to themself.  But you cant ever really prove it at all.

@_date: 2017-08-14 17:52:11
I'm loving your responses, thank you.  I was mistakenly pinning BTC's value to USD at the time of the borrow, thinking that if I borrowed 1BTC when it cost 4kUSD and it increased to 4500 USD, I would only have to repay the original 4k that it cost.  Your explanation cleared that up nicely.  Thanks again

If anyone has anything to say about Googling it I'll screenshot my results.  It's all shitty news and no good links.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:08:23
So are you saying lending is basically the same amount of risk as leaving your coins on the exchange?  I just don't understand why someone would need to borrow BTC. If they have the BTC to gamble with why don't they use their own?  If they don't have the BTC then why would the site expect them to pay it back? I've looked everywhere I can and am completely clueless how it makes any sense.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:25:58
Shapeshift. Ever since the day I heard of bitcoin I have been dreaming night and day of the potential decentralized world it could lead to. Please don't start with the blacklist stuff. Do you really think a few criminals are causing more harm than a government printing unknown amounts of money? Besides, there will be no slack in a decentralized crypto world. People didn't patch their computers and got hacked. Who's fault is that? It's either the NSA or those who didn't patch. People will learn. You could very seriously be putting decentralized currencies that you're clearly passionate about years behind by starting this trend.

This is terrifying. I've been promoting binance since the DAY it launched. I was unaware that at any given time you could decide to hold my funds until I provided KYC. That's heartbreaking really. I value my privacy and cryptocurrency is one of the only places you can really have that. I'm in the process of withdrawing everything now and there hasn't been any issue. I wish there was a certain limit that you could trade under without having to be fearful of this. Please change this policy. Since when do you bow down to regulators? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:15:49
I'm with you. But real quick can you clue me in on how interest rates going up causes property values to inflate? I can sort of see it but am thinking along the lines of prices move to meet demands.  If interest rates are high enough to make people think twice about taking out loans couldn't that drive property prices down to increase liquidity?
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:32:38
Thats an extra precaution for the incredibly small chance someone is able to use it as an attack vector.

Didn’t coinbase get added to this list out of speculation? I hope so because I know they really put the nail in the coffin recently and I don’t have any viable alternatives for auto buys 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:52:37
I even imagine Coinbase did this on purpose.  It didn't take long to see that Bcash wasn't going to be the mainstream crypto.  They could have sold as many as possible in the beginning and known they could buy back cheaper at a later date.

I think point EnaiSiaion was trying to make is where do you draw the line.  Just because owners of exchanges that are tight with the largest miner/manufacturer of miners in the world are selling their new forked coin, what makes it better than Enaicoin?

Can you expand on that a little bit.  I've read all these papers and have had them stuck in my head for weeks. I took this part of the same article to be a counter to your claim. 
" The price of bitcoins in Indian Rupees goes up, a premium develops relative to other currency pairs. A bitcoin in India might be worth $600, while in the U.S. it trades at $500. Traders would buy bitcoins in the U.S. and sell them in India to net a $100 gain. They would then sell their Indian Rupees for dollars. This would weaken the Indian Rupee, causing import inflation and losses for foreign investors."
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:28:40
Wow holy shit I have one .4 miles from where I work and they are selling for 240 dollars above the market price and you can cash out for 150 less than your coins are worth. Useless

As far as "extreme measures", I can only see it point to one thing. Unless there is a complete ban on the encryption being used around the world every day, on every smartphone and on every website using SSL. There is no way to stop it.  Any method other than a complete ban on encryption would fail.

So when you have your coins on Coinbase or any exchange you really just have a representation of the coins that the site is holding for you. Actual ownership of the coin is when you have the private key that can move the coin.  Thats the crytographically secure part of the whole system.   is the site I use to generate my keys.  You can download the site for yourself and then access it on your own computer while you are not even on the internet for added security.  If you aren't really technically into that, I recommend at least exiting out of your tabs and reopening your browser before navigating to that site and generating the keys. The reason you are moving your mouse around is to create entropy. The javascript code on that site is capturing different points where your mouse is in intervals and using those pseudorandom points to create addresses that are *extra* random. Unless you have a virus or some kind of malware you will be fine. What you will end up with are addresses and some QR codes to go along with them. Here's an example it generates. 
* 1EzE4DtdwkpSK6x2TLNTBLs3wTbgBfW3R7
Private Key  
* L3j56nYtsZKF9iqgraD4RMm7NKwPXBTTvYtaxHs98F7uHD4hhQsf
The shorter code or your "public key" can be shared with anyone.  If you want someone to send you a transaction this is the code you give them.  Those addresses are cryptographically tied together in a way that the private key can't be derived from the public key with a method other than guess and check.  The sheer amount of computational power that would take is what gives bitcoin it's security. There are literally more possible keys than the amount of hydrogen molecules we could fit into the known universe to the 99th power or so I've read, but like most, cant fully comprehend.
The addresses are also tied together in a way that you can prove you are the owner of the public address by encrypting a message with your private key that is reversible by your public key. This allows BTC to be sent without ever needing to expose your private address.  
I recommend printing those addresses out and making sure that when you dispose of your printer you absolutely destroy it (especially its harddrive) rather than throwing it away.  If you have the coinbase app on your phone you can go to the send button and click in the top right to scan a QR code.  Scan your public address only and ship your bitcoin off to it.  Don't ever let that private key see the light of day until you are ready to move your coins again. If you never send coins from that address it is all the more protected against quantum computing attacks. That part is basically irrelevant for an unknown amount of time, I just wanted to give you good advice if you plan to sit on your coins for a very long time. (which I recommend)
When you're ready to put your keys back for whatever reason, you can import them to coinbase or wherever you want by using your private key.

For once in my life I'm in a position that I can't choose a side. My initial thoughts however are leaning towarsa thinking big blocks are fairly harmless. I would love to discuss the topic with someone passionate about it to try and get a better understanding. Pretty much everything makes sense to me except for segwit2x. I hate hearing respectable community members preaching about the vulnerabilities of segwit and not being able to imagine how the geniuses who are writing this code somehow don't understand the holes they are creating? No way right? There's a few big altcoins already on it and I haven't heard of any issues. What stance are you taking OP? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:15:03
You're right about maybe all of that.  I don't see why it couldn't be considered a perk for the service they provide though. Many of the people deeply interested in bitcoin agree that bitcoin was created envisioning a world where a central government doesn't force a company to basically agree to a potentially unlimited workload. People might choose to keep your coins there. I don't. This industry is about to get into the center of the craziest regulation topics ever.  The more wins we get now in terms of freedoms is incredibly useful for future precedents in cases.  Bitcoins about freedom. You are the one in control of what happens to your finances.
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:07:47
The whole question of plausible deniability hasn't even been touched yet by regulation. That's going to be really really interesting. If I buy on Coinbase then make one transfer to a paper wallet then it's pretty easily still tied to me if I cash out. But what if you transfer twice? There's zero way to prove the sender of the second transfaction. I have no idea what will come of this.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:26:54

I can help with your investing strategy. Buy btc anytime you can at whatever price it's at. Don't touch it unless your life depends on it. In 5 years never spend more than 1% of your holdings on anything. Can't afford that we house you want with 1% of your BTC holdings? Wait another year or so.

@_date: 2017-07-29 02:11:20
Not to mention by leaving your money on coinbase during the fork you are 100% giving away free money.  If you choose not to use the forked Bitcoin known as BCC, you can sell it the instant it become tradable for regular Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:11:34

@_date: 2017-07-29 04:51:49
It could require a decent amount of development work though. It's not *exactly* like they have the system already in place and could just turn it on. I just don't like the idea of forcing a company to do something.  It leaves room for other exchanges to pop up and shows the necessity for a strong decentralized exchange. I'm just saying in a free market the Bitcoin users can decide for themselves how to use their money.  If our governments force regulations on companies dealing with cryptocurrencies it will slow the evolution by having tons of people still relying on third parties. It's really not that hard to figure out how to send them off of coinbase.  Anyone who has a 20 minute attention span to dedicate to their financial security can move coins.  There will be tons of people who say fuck that its too complicated and they don't want to.  Why cater to them and embrace any regulation at all in crypto?

@_date: 2017-07-22 17:04:39
I do buy from exchanges. Not saying they should be shut down or anything. It's just a worthless service because they have to pay business tax on the bitcoin atms. In Nevada you don't have to but most places you do. I guess the atms can be used to cash out a little at a time without paying capital gains but you're still paying someone a "tax".
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:16:50
I want to laugh too because it absolutely should be completely ridiculous and they should not have to comply with doing extra work to support forks.  On the other I honestly don't know... The people making final decisions on shit like this don't typically understand it very well.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:14:52
This thing has its ups and downs.  I agree with you on one hand.  On the other, this system requires you to be able to take care of yourself.  There are many people who are willing to take the time to learn the inner working if it means true financial independence. Historically take a look at how often the people that were trusted to hold bitcoin "got hacked". Bitcoin is about no trust.  If that part makes it take a while longer to catch on that's okay with me because its certainly never going to change.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:21:26
