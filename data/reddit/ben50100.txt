Coinbase/GDAX do margin trades so take a loan from them. They can easily follow up with you if it pops, or you can't maintain your margin

It means you give them an amount of money and they let you loan up. 
So say you give them $1000, you can buy $4000 worth of bitcoin, but if it drops 25% and you lose $1000 you lose everything.
You have to maintain an amount with them otherwise they will prematurely sell your bitcoins, so technically you will never owe them any money. It is sort of a loan that they have no risk from you. It is basically magnifying the risk with your sum of money.

The spread is large because it lets you buy bitcoins and then transfer them over to the US to sell. This way you can skirt the fx exchange regulations, hence the local premium. It doesn't matter what price bitcoin is at, there will always be a premium for it in China (even on the underground).
To put it another way, to arbitrage it you have to sell bitcoin in china and send the proceeds out to buy more bitcoins in another country and sell them in China, but you can't get the money out (over $50k anyway)
