Well, I think there may be hoarding in a phase of **temporary deflation**. So when you see (edit: product) prices are going down, but you expect the deflation to go away soon, you will tend to wait with non-critical purchases.
Bitcoin is, in my opinion, more comparable to computer hardware. Computer hardware traditionally lost value very fast, because much better products enter the market very fast (compared to other markets). So there is no **smart time-frame** to buy hardware. So people just buy when they need it.

In the case of Wikipedia, they dont necessarily need it to be safe for a huge amounts of time. They could convert all the coins they get into traditional money within short time (days at the most). So even if the Bitcoin experiment was to fail in the future (which I dont believe), they can easily convert the donations to any money they want.

Only solution I could think of:
You create a community of like-minded iranian people, who are convinced that Bitcoins have value. Then, they at least have a base currency to exchange with goods and services with **each other**.
If you are really optimistic, you could imagine this community will expand, since other people see that you have found an easier way to trade than bartering. The bigger the community gets, the more each member benefits from it, since variety increases, and some people might even figure out how sell their products/services to a global market, or even find ways to import/smuggle much needed goods into this community.
Really the hardest step is to form the initial group, and reach a critical mass.

About the 51% attack. I dont know if it would be that easy for -one- government to pull it off. Mind the scenario we are speaking of is happening in a point in time when Bitcoin is big enough for some government to care about it.
At that point, nobody can say what the Hashing technology and distribution will look like, but I'd expect that there will be players all over the world, who will compete with a governments hashing power.
If there will be an initiative of several governments (like for example the U.N.) to stick together and pool their hashing ressources, things might look differently..

I am no economy expert; I understood deflation as "product prizes go down" so far, and did not concern myself with money supply deflation/inflation.
Is it not really the same beast, just from a different perspective? Meaning: If you have money supply inflation (money unit drops in value), you automatically have price inflation, because product prizes need to be adjusted up if the "real" value of products is unchanged. (Money supply inflation leads to prize inflation)


Here you mean the prize / value of one unit of money, which is going up, right? I was just viewing it from the other perspective: If the money is worth more, product prizes need to be lowered if a products "real" value did not change. (Money supply deflation leads to prize deflation)
So I think we are talking about the same thing here, just from different perspectives, do you agree?
To the comparison with pc hardware:
Imagine hardware reseach would suddenly stop and production and demand of pc hardware would be equal. The "real" value of the good "pc hardware" should be constant in that scenario, right?
If you had some currency which has neither inflation nor deflation, then the prize of pc hardware should always be constant.
My point is, you can now change two variables to get the same effect:
You can change your currency to have some deflation, or you can continue hardware research and flood the market with newer and better products. In both cases the prize of an existing product will decrease over time. So, out of a customers perspective, making buying decisions having a deflating currency should be similar to buying hardware today.

The biggest (non-technical) threat I can imagine happening is the posession of BTC being made illegal for whatever reasons (I am not only speaking of the US).

@_date: 2011-06-08 16:46:31
Even less. A wallet.dat stores 100 unused adresses in advance. So after a backup you can do 100 transactions until you should backup again.
Not having a trojan sure increases security. If you ever have to manage a serious amount of BTC, I would suggest running the client in a virtual machine or on linux, so that any malware is unlikely.

@_date: 2011-06-04 04:22:15
I very much agree with your post!
Also I think the deflationary manner of BitCoin creates incentives to people, to hop on the bandwagon as soon as possible. These early adopters then have further incentive to convince more and more people of BitCoin (because then their own Coins become more valueable).
This kind of social effect is hardly imaginable with an inflationary currency.

I put in 60 € in February, when a coin was traded 0.77 $, and I mined a bit February with 160 MHash. So I hold about 150 coins. 
I could sell them now for about 4500 $, which is a nice amount of money.
But I bought them seeing their potential to become a serious milestone in internet history, and with the intention to only sell or trade the coins, if it is a life-changing sum. 
If Bitcoins happen to fail, I only lost 60 € and some energy. I hope I still see it that way, if they really fail. :-)

The amount of work needed to forge an alternative block-chain is not the only barrier that has to fall for bitcoin to fail.
Even if you could forge a 'malicious' block chain within minutes, you still would need to trick people into using it. For example, the BitCoin community could hard code the latest valid Merkle-root hash into the official client. With that at least all past transactions would be secured. Then, we would need to find a new proof-of-work that makes it hard enough again to create new blocks. I am convinced that there will always be ways to implement a proof-of-work concept.

1. I do not think a decrease in value is bad for bitcoin (only for speculators)
2. Imo public interest decreased for the following reasons:
 A. BTC are still too hard to get.
 B. BTC are still too hard / unsafe to use for non technical people.
But solutions to these points are in development, and I have the believe once getting and using BTC is really safe and easy (No trojan can just steal your money from your hard drive! /assuming most non techies know moot about Truecrypt etc.), BTC will regain public interest followed by an increase in value.

If I understand it correctly, the system protects itself against double-spendings by hashing the actual transaction data (blocks). 
So if you would just use some result from folding or whatever, a fraudster could take the same proof-of-work data for the scam chain again (which he currently can not).
I am not saying tough, that there is no smart way like combining a hash of the transaction data to secure with some 'useful' computation.

So if 10^-2 -&gt; 0.01 BTC are BitCents, 10^-3 -&gt; 0.001 BTC should be BitMills, right? But what comes then? The next prefix from the SI-System would be 'Micro' (which is 10^-6 -&gt; 0.000001 BTC. So 100 BitCent make 1 BTC; 10 BitMills make 1 BitCent and 1000 MicroBTC make one BitMill.

I read some more about your system.
I like the incorporation and improvement of the 'deterministic wallet' idea much (preventing dictionary attacks).
I am still a bit confused about the passphrase and tokens. Could you clarify which information the service needs (the non-applet part)? 
For example in the 'about' section you write:


Is this done by the site or 'my' applet?
Why can the tokens (or something similar) not be controlled by the applet as well? Could you not let the user use something like a keyfile to distort the passphrase?
@_date: 2011-06-08 02:53:02
I am missing the feature to have more control over my adresses. I would like to:
* see the balance of every single adress
* decide myself from which adress(es) I want to spend coins
* lock certain Coins from not being spend (until I unlock)
That way it would be much more clear what is actually happening, e.g. "why do I have balance on a new adress after sending money?" -&gt; "Ah because Coins (adresses with balance) can not be spent partially and the rest is transferred to a new adress".

@_date: 2011-10-18 12:42:57
A problem I see concerning bitcoin as a P2P or P2B payment option is its volatility in value. It requires you to keep up with the current exchange rates.
Imo a service that guarantees you a certain value of deposited bitcoins for a certain while should be considered (I think SilkRoad does this). So if you deposit 10 BTC and the current MtGox rate is 2 $/BTC, the service credits you 20 $(or Euro or Gold or Cigarettes ..). 
If you need to use Bitcoin some time later, and the rate has gone to 1.6$/BTC, the service gives you 12.5 BTC (perhaps minus some fee). On the other hand, if the rate is 3$/BTC, you only get 6.66 BTC back.
I dont know exactly how a service like this can be done (with profit). I think hedging against lower (higher) rates could be the solution.
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:24:14
1. With miners who act rationally (mine if costs are lower than profits, stop otherwise), you should not win much, but should not lose much either, because the volume of mining operation should always adapt to the two key variables: Diffculty and $/BTC.
But note two possibilities: 
A. There could be miners that have lower or no electricity prices. You cant compete with those, having eletricity costs.
B. There could be miners who act irrationally. Meaning they mine, even if it is unprofitable for them (for the lulz or to test the technology). They could drive difficulty up and render you unprofitable.
Last thing to 1.: It depends on whether you plan to sell the BTC right after mining them or not. If not, it is another form of speculation. I for example switched off my computer from mining in February, because the price of a BTC was 0.77$ and I didnt earn that much. But now the value ranges from 20-30 $ and in retrospect it would have been very profitable.

such a long thread, which page should I look at?
@_date: 2011-04-06 17:47:21
Very nice idea.
Imo we should keep the "flatrate" option. 
That means your votes/donations are not immediately processed, but collected until a defined time-frame (a month, week, day or X hours) has passed. 
At the end of this time-frame (or before) you decide about how much BTC you want to donate this time. This amount is then split up among those sites/people you liked.
It is a psychological thing. Flatrates always feel more comfortable, since you spend the money anyways, so there is no need to be greedy.
Of course besides the "flatrate" there should still be an option to donate X BTC to Y.

I disagree that putting all your money in Bitcoin is the wisest thing to do. I do believe Bitcoin has a fair chance to become a major (or the leading) currency, but the probability for it is definitely not 100%.
Also if you buy Bitcoin even for a small fraction of your money NOW, you would never need to worry about money anymore, if Bitcoin succeeds. But if it fails (Bitcoin is not worth anything anymore), you have not lost all your money.

Nobody can do anything except the OP (because he holds the private keys of his adresses). We can only advise him what to do, once we know what the problem is.
In case the transaction has happened but is not displayed in his client, I would say he should backup his wallet.dat and reinstall BitCoin, then copy the wallet.dat into the new installation, redownload the block chain and see if that helps.
But this all does not seem to matter now anyways, since OP did not answer for 24 hours now and probably figured it out on his own and forgot about this post here :-)

It has huge potential imo. And will attract a lot of bitcoin-interested. Really cool.

As I understood, the french bank they tried to open a account on, refused to do it (probably scared of bitcoin).
MtGox sued (dont know if its the right word) the bank, because french law states that a bank can not refuse to open an account without special reason. The court (or whoever) gave MtGox right and forced the bank to open an account until this sunday (Sept. 4th), or they have to pay 5000 € fine per day (!!).

Yep, this is completely doable (and has been proposed on the bitcoin forums afaik). Some people expect, that the major payment processors (VISA, Paypal, etc.) will be Bitcoin-friendly eventually and provide these services.

Afaik most africans dont use banks. Many use mobile phone payment systems like [M-Pesa]( 
Vendors (little shops) which are selling credits for that are very common and widespread already. Imo it would only be a small step for them to accept Bitcoin payments and exchange them for M-Pesa credits or cash.
Edit: After rereading your post, I agree exchanging Bitcoins back to their local currency would be the hardest part for vendors (assuming there will be no big market for Bitcoins in 3rd world countries in the forseeable future).

1. Please post any trading to 
2. Do you happen to have any ratings on  or somewhere else?
3. Everyone else, beware of scammers (I do not believe you are one, but you never know)

My bet is, should bitcoin become more widespread, the valuation will follow a logarithmic curve, with high increases in value at the beginning, which become gradually slower.

You should present some info/screenshots/videos of the used software. I bet there are other people like me that are too lazy to register just to see how it works / looks like.
Good luck with your site.

The same for me! I can only look at Bitcoin with very mixed feelings lately..

Wow, interesting. If I may ask, what is your procedure doing this. Do you have any safety precautions? Are you not in fear coming into contact with some kind of criminal?

If I am understanding it right, the token would always have to be worth more than a scam could potentially yield, in order to keep the incentive not to scam.
So say you use it on an ebay-like system, you would have to (temporarily) sink X Bitcoin into this token, so you can make transactions with value &lt; X.
Also who or what prevents me from using the token in more than one transaction at the same time? I could scam multiple transactions who are of value &lt; X but add up to a value &gt; X.
Finally, who is the judge about what is a scam and what only a false accusation of scamming?
Dont get me wrong, I think it is a fascinating idea, I just dont see it working with what I know; do you have any more info / links about this?
