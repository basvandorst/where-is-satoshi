1\) Move your btc onto a different device so it is safe
2\) Do the same for any other coins you have the ready ability to move and plan on keeping
3\) we are going to defeat the entire purpose of your hardware wallet by bringing your seed phrase onto a computer. Using a live\-boot linux system is recommended [
4\) Your individual WIF private keys can be extracted with Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool [
5\) These WIF private keys can be used with any number of tools, the safest is [ but it is a bit scary to people that aren't into CLI interfaces
We cover all of this in our guides and try to make it easy for the novice [
If a Linux live boot system is too much for your skill level at the moment, we also show you how to grab and run the bitcoin\_fork\_claimer tool on Windows:

We hear ya, and we are working on this improvement.
A thing to realize is that getting accurate prices in the obscure alt market is still a difficult problem \- our price feeds are from Coinmarketcap, and they are still having a lot of trouble with obscure coins. I think this is solvable in time, but for now it is unsolved.
Exchanges that trade coins which are not open for deposit tend to trade at much higher prices, skewing the data in the price feed. We track where exchanges are and aren't open for deposit for particular coins, which can be seen on our pages. BitcoinX \(BCX\) for example trades \*much\* lower where it is open for deposit. [

There is no substitute for just going through the project of buying a small amount and seeing **your** balance on your device and on a block explorer. That will jolt your nervous system to really connect what is happening when people talk about transactions and price movements and all that.
Just don't buy too much before you really feel like you understand it. Gotta learn to drink through a straw before you can try the firehose.

I think it is just hard to spot what Bitcoin is actually useful for if you haven't sat down and studied it for a bit \- even then, there is so much noise in the space trying to FUD you into buying bad coins with clear problems.
The first level of reasoning is that Bitcoin is censorship resistance in electronic payment \- as long as people try to censor payments, Bitcoin will have a niche. Rich people trying to hide money away from taxes are beginning to latch on to this. Just have to give it some time.
The second level of reasoning is that if you have censorship resistance in electronic payment, you can **program** transfers of money for computer systems **just like you can write data to disk** **and count on it not changing in the future**. You can't do that with PayPal. If you can program money, that opens up quite a lot of new paradigms in technology. High\-tech investors know how tech can transform society within the course of a decade.
The kids that understand computers get it. Old dudes that got rich buying railways and CocaCola don't.

Here is a quick overview for people that haven't been following Bitcoin forks closely:
In total, at [forkdrop.io]( we are tracking **71 forks** that still appear to be marginally active projects. There are **another 19** we have classified as 'Historic' because they appear to be dead projects and/or are no longer relevant to current BTC holders.
Our criteria is that they **utilize the UTXO set of Bitcoin in some way**, such that people with keys in cold storage either get coins passively through inaction \(fork, or passive airdrop\). Or have some future window to register with the project without giving up custody of their BTC in order to get free coins \(registered airdrop\).
There are about 25\-30 Bitcoin forks that have live networks that can be moved and redeemed for some amount of value without downloading bad wallet software \(though it becomes harder for less value at the low end\). We recommend using [ for which we have provided extensive guides on using [
There are another small handful that may be possible to move coins on using sketchy software. It is really hard to recommend messing with this unless you really know what you are doing.
The remainder are 'upcoming projects' that may or may not launch. There appears to be a couple new projects announced every week.
At [ We are tracking 83 exchanges that accept deposits and trade some of these coins to assist finding buyers. We record the KYC/non\-KYC status of exchanges to the best of our knowledge to help users that wish to preserve their anonymity.
In general, effectively claiming forks is still a bit of a chore and there is a lot of 'bait' to get you to do things with your private keys that aren't advisable but might save you time. However, the good news is that the tools are improving and this should gradually get easier over time.

Just so everyone is clear, this is natural gas that would otherwise be flared or released - both wasteful outcomes. This company is innovating by exploring the fact that much energy in the world is not portable, whereas Bitcoin miners are, so you can bring the miners to the site of the energy rather than vice versa.
If this tech takes off, it is adding incredible efficiency to natural gas extraction by turning waste energy into network security.

Yeah, one would think. I think the story is that these inefficiencies are there because developing reliable software for handling all these coins is a slow moving process. New forks with new quirks come faster than the exchanges can respond with their threadbare engineering talent.
Another element is that there isn't a lot of supply liquidity from airdropped coins to come on to the market. There are whales with 10s of thousands of coins, but the incentive is to not be messing with their cold storage until the trustworthy tools to extract the forked coins get more mature \- another bottleneck of software engineering talent. If popular wallets add support for Fork X, you would think that the price of Fork X drops due to the new supply. In that process, the traders and value buyers get their hands on more coins. I would hypothesize that the traders and value buyers are better sources of trading liquidity than the long term BTC hodler that just wants to cash in their 'free money' from the fork.
As liquidity improves the arbitrage opportunity would temper. The data is there for you to go look but I would say that liquidity is just barely coming online for coins below the top 5\-10 ranked fork coins we track at forkdrop. Perhaps that means good arbitrage opportunities for peoples with bots that move quickly, but I am no expert on these topics.

The phenomenon of markets for forked coins might be an interesting place to study. Upon the creation of the fork, the cold storage of the exchanges gets credited and in theory those coins belong to the users. Exchanges seem to do one of three things:
1\) nothing, ignore it and/or deny the existence of the fork and/or FUD its legitimacy. These exchanges are busy and this is less effort, so I can see why they do this.
2\) credit the users and support the coin for deposit and withdrawal creating an efficient market, should trading liquidity and arbitrage opportunities with other exchanges doing the same open up
3\) Credit the users, **however,** do not open up for deposits and withdrawal and just trade** trapped coin**s.
The result is that between  and  there are **two markets for the same coin**, one somewhat efficient condiment on liquidity, and one that is not at all efficient. Looking at the price differences between exchanges, this often appears as a huge arbitrage opportunity, but looking closer, it is not because one exchange has coins trapped.
Also, the KYC/AML premium is real for these coins. People bought their BTC anonymously, but want their extra value from the forks and don't want to correlate their identity with the blockchain records. This category of user **will sell for less** on an exchanges where they don't have to give up their name, **creating arbitrage opportunities** for those that can straddle KYC and non\-KYC exchanges trading the same coins.
My site has an up to date dataset on forked coins, exchanges that trade them, whether deposit/withdrawal is supported and the KYC requirements of the exchanges. [

Terrible explanation. This man is a charlatan.
You don't need blocks if your consensus mechanism is 'democratic', just vote on every transaction, dummy.
The cryptography is for digital signatures, not encryption, dummy.
If y'all want to vote, y'all need an identity system - good luck with that. Google, Twitter and Facebook can't prevent the bots from manipulating everything and they have much more than a shitty database to work with, dummy.

With layer 2 tech like Lightning Network and sidechains, dividing down to fractional satoshis is even possible. LN currently supports msatoshis (1/1000th of a satoshi, aka 1/286,532th of a USD penny at current exchange rates).
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:30:40
I would say we need to make the case for what can be built with the new tech. With SegWit, we had malleability as a clear barrier to the kinds of things we knew we wanted to build. I think Taproot and Schnorr are flipping amazing technologically, but I still haven't digested the clear 'why'.
What is lacking in the current architecture that this is the clear remedy of? Will other approaches work better? Is this soft fork necessary at all given that we now have real Layer 2 stuff to play with and be inventive with? I think there are very good answers, but the next phase is articulating that part. Might take a few years, and that is alright.
