So its a law that your whining about. A law that millions of others have to go through. You should find a seller who accepts bitcoin only as payment. Only way to satisfy your needs.

I'm serious those 2 websites are calling bitcoin, bitcoin legacy and bitcoin cash, bitcoin. So coin market cap removed those sites from the website because they are now turning over to bitcoin cash.

Because those site said they would no longer support bitcoin legacy.
Edit: I'm not calling bitcoin bitcoin legacy. Those websites are calling it that. If you look down there's a copy of a Twitter post by bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-13 21:45:13
Ahhh that makes sense. Ill re edit my top comment. I don't understand how they can just call a coin something its not. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:16:54
Def exit scam designed to ban Crypto Currency in the US. There's a reason why everyone is jumping ship on Kraken/Polo/Bittrex

No I just said find a person who will sell you the house in bitcoin. It's a free market after all. It's very simple concept that you millennials seem to not understand. You chose to invest in something that is not backed by any entity what so ever. So when you decide you want to cash out of your "fun money" into real capital again you get upset because you feel entitled to whatever it is you feel entitled to. But you have the freedom to choose what to invest in or not invest in. The Freedom to look for other avenues to conduct your business. Just because you think it's unfair doesn't mean its unfair

Did you have 2FA enabled?
Edit: 
Judging by the amount of transactions he was able to make I'm going to go out on a limb and say no You don't have 2FA enabled. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:04:09
Looked up root stock...looked up what it used...
Looked back at my ETH Wallet
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:58:56
You should look into buying some ETH. or GNT 
People Hating on ETH because they know ETH will surpass the coin in a few years. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:58:22
It's still no ETH but its a start. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:18:15
Glad no one listened to this guy.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:11:56
Please tell me more. I've seen people mention it before.
