A year ago? Shoot did I miss my shot?

HODL forever, you only lose money when you sell!

Also "internal management issues" definitely means all my crypto is gone

Let's blame it on Bitcoin cash!
But in all seriousness I'm getting fed up as hell with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:55:17
I got in at 13,634 and 14,544. Being a really new trader that's just been doing research for a while I'm pretty proud of myself.

It's almost like you can tell I'm 12 with a fake ID 
Or I watched one YouTube video and now I hold skype calls and tell everyone I know all about Crypto
Or that I panic bought during the dip because I am a weak son of a Bitch but I'll never tell my friends that and instead say I kept calm and bought during the dip responsibly 
Only one of these is true, I'll leave to the imagination which one

I used to have the same issue, it seems to have just gone away after a while
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:39:20
Woah now, tell me these are real numbers! My Coinbase froze at 16.4, if it's 16.9 now it's still Christmas

Gotta love some s*** corruption

This is going to cause a dip I can't buy because I'm on coinbase won't it
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:57:14
Don't forget about getting high with a little help from my friends
Edit: I meant 20k high don't kick me back to r/trees

You know when poker players are in a tight spot so they just go all in to bluff? That's the shoes I was in. Either lose it all or lose none. Fortunately I bought the dip and ended better off than I was, but this is why I'm no longer allowing myself to drink and get on coinbase
