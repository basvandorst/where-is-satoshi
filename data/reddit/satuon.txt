Occam's razor, man...

Is that USD to bitcoin and vice versa, not just transfers between wallets?
Anyway, even at 55 million, you don't need a market cap of 8.5 billion. Actually, what is the daily transfer of dollars vs. their market cap (total money supply)? Does anyone know that? I'd like to compare them, to see if bitcoin's is abnormal.
@_date: 2014-06-04 06:40:07
Well, there were different estimations - m1, m2, m3. Not sure which is the most appropriate.

Bitcoin will become usable when it's price stops moving so much. If it stabilizes around $5, and just stays there, it becomes much more usable than if it goes from $100 to $1000 in a month, because then you don't know what the price will be tomorrow.

The +$100 dollars was because people with Gox dollars couldn't get them out except by converting them to bitcoins. So you would get +$100 dollars which are locked-in, and you can't get them out.
Supply and demand.

Are there many scams in or is it generally safe? What's the reputation of in this regard?

Hence the password protection.

Money changes hands, a single $20 bill facilitates $20 dollars each time it changes hands. If it changes hands 10 times in a given day, it has facilitated trade worth $200 dollars.
Anyway, mutecow and thieflar have already elaborated my point well enough.
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:32:34
That's the problem. If bitcoin could stabilize even at $1, like someone pegged it to $1, it's utility could be huge - you could buy, hold, etc., without fear.
As it is now, you need to get rid of it immediately, otherwise you could lose money. That forces you to constantly exchange it to dollars back and forth, and lose money in fees, until it becomes more expensive than using ordinary banking.
Right now the only thing bitcoin offers is anonymity - and even there you don't have much because you need to buy/sell in an exchange.

His audience is 4.5 million people listening every week, according to [his website](

I bought mine from a guy I know who started mining. I paid him cash on hand, so I still haven't bought Bitcoins from an exchange.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:21:38
Yes, what he did is a crime, obviously, and catching him would send a message that hacking like that has real consequences. I really hope he's 18 year old and whines "but I was just playing" when they give him 10 years. I would be laughing hysterically then.
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:10:24


Right now, even a value of $10 would suffice, because there are no big transfers. I doubt there are more than a million dollars transferred daily via bitcoin.
So at least right now, the market cap is much bigger than what it needs to be in order to facilitate what little trade there actually is.

I watch him only on YouTube, at least there he has no control over the design :)
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:22:38
How does work? Is there some form of escrow, or do you just blindly trust?
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:15:30
If they do that, how can they distinguish someone moving bitcoins between his own wallets? That's not much of economic activity.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:29:37
What worries me is the lack of volume, it seems most people just speculate on Bitcoin. To be useful, people should buy things with it. Otherwise it's too much like a pyramid scheme.
And I think there won't be another $1-$1000 moment, I don't think it will ever rise 1000 times again. That boat has sailed.
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:56:05
Sure, if bitcoin becomes the national currency of the world and nobody uses any other currency it would increase its price a lot.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:44:05
Yes, it's like buying junk shares.
@_date: 2014-05-22 13:44:19
Now it makes more sense, yeah.
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:28:44
Why not? Donations are a real thing, and Bitcoin can soak up some of that transaction volume now.
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:00:45
What's the point? If you are in the same room, just pay cash. The power of bitcoin is you can pay online anonymously, that's the only thing it's better at than anything existing.
Cash is more accepted, and anonymous, but you can't purchase things online, or send it to people who are far away. Bank transfers can't move easily accross borders, and they lack anonymity.
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:50:46
Hasn't it so far?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:57:34
What about your mobile phone? Can't you have a password-protected offline wallet on your mobile phone?
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:25:18
So they wait for it to tank to sell? And buy when it's high instead?
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:00:27
Because online wallets don't take 7-8 hours to sync before being usable, and they don't use up 7-8 gigabytes of harddisk.
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:52:05
A lot of people do it because they're lazy. The people who recommended to me to use an online wallet touted it only because it requires the least amount of effort.
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:14:25
It just that I'm too lazy to do 1 hour of research to write a 1 minute reddit post. You think those stats are so easy to find?
Besides, if I'm wrong, someone will call me out, and I'll learn something.
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:27:13
What's that? What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:52:46
Will you sell at $800 then?
Cause I'm wondering how many people are waiting on the sidelines to "break even" and stampede out the moment it hits a certain price point.
All the suckers who bought and lost sleep when the price fell are going to sell now the moment they can break even, creating a huge downward pressure. The climb might look a lot more difficult this time around.
@_date: 2014-06-04 06:54:33
This. The point is, we should also estimate the time it takes for them to exchange those bitcoins to their local currency. Otherwise they have no money, just bitcoins. At least in Zanzibar, I doubt there are stores or anything accepting bitcoins.
Also, if there are no local exchanges, and they need to use a US-based exchanged, then the money will still cross borders and be subject to the same fees, taxes and problems had you done a direct transfer.
Not to mention if they have never used bitcoin (which the majority of people have not), they will need to figure out how to exchange the bitcoins, create an account, fill in all the information, for the first time. It might take them A LOT more time and end up hours and days until they figure it out.

I think he was talking about the account balances at Mt. Gox, because he was talking about bank runs and the FDIC immediately before the video starts.
@_date: 2014-05-26 07:04:19
That's the reason the price was higher - you were paid $1100 dollars you can't withdraw, instead of $1000 dollars you can withdraw.
If the price was the same, nobody would prefer locked-in dollars, so there has to be a discount for them.
