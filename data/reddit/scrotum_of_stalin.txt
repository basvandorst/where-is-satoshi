Thanks very much!! I'm very excited to try this.

I just use the term "bitcorn" or "bits of corn" when writing non-secure/encrypted memos that are viewable by companies. Hasn't failed yet! And I know Professor Bitcorn would be proud.

Ya, I know they are always looking for developers and semi-occasionally a business management person, but I'm not a CS major (although I'm trying very hard to self teach myself at a breakneck pace currently) nor am I experienced in running and managing businesses (I'm still young). Hopefully soon I'll have the technical skills they are looking for..

That's just picking randomly though. I am very confident most would agree with me that picking the winner of these two matches I am about to pull from the real bracket isn't (1/2)(1/2):
Croatia vs. Brazil
Australia vs. Spain
I'm sure more than 25% of people guessing will pick the correct winner.

I'm perfect for the job! Where do I sign up?

As someone who wants to do a consulting service of bitcoin/doge/drkcoin/etc on my college campus/town what would you suggest is a reasonable cost to not make it sound like a scam? I am completely willing to do it for free just to get my name out there as a reputable party for this technology and hopefully one day charge, but as of right now my primary motivation is only trying to help the currencies get established in my immediate area. What would be a simple "cost" to make my service sound legitimate (I really don't care about making a profit off my advice right now), but isn't a real cost to deter people from asking me? That is the dilemma here.

So does DRK/Vert/insert alt with unique property here.

Ya, I wish they would do internships. I'd try to apply in a heartbeat. I have been an avid miner and an enthusiastic/supporter of cryptos for awhile now. I'm even possibly thinking of attempting to start a bitcoin club at my college like MIT. The passion I'd have to work hard at a place like coinbase or bitpay would be drastically higher than your "standard 9-5."

Full disclosure: I hold no DRK, and I hold BTC and DOGE so no conflict of interest.
With that said, DRK anonymity is slightly different in execution than DarkWallet currently is. There's a post by evan duffield of DRK on bitcointalk fully explaining the difference between DRK's coinjoin implementation and DarkWallet's implementation. In short, the answer is that currently DRK provides a much stronger blanket of secrecy than the alpha version of DarkWallet, but obviously many things can change as DarkWallet matures to completion. I think DRK won't become as big as it looks and that is why I haven't bought in and am currently just holding BTC and DOGE.

I completely agree. I think bitcoin's main power isn't bringing anything unique to the table (because frankly it doesn't, it's the bare bones of what a crypto is), instead it's bringing massive amounts of confidence more so than any other crypto so that unique features will be built on top of its blockchain. That's why I'm converting almost all of my mined altcoins into BTC (and some into DOGE just for teh lulz and fun).
