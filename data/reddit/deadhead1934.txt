"I like that."  "A bank once charged me $3 to transfer money... not much money... to a joint account with my wife, and I canceled and never used that bank again."  "Ok, where do I keep my bitcoin away from viruses and the hacker guys?"

"On the railroad, we used to get paid for riding a train to a location where you are needed.  I found a way to get paid going and coming and going agagin for a while, and then I got caught and sent to the Superintendent.  They closed the loophole and my buddies started calling me Dead Head".

"Yes, we have an account like that.  A bank account like that.  My son says he'll explain the paper later cause it's not like paper money you can spend.  Do I have to get a smart phone?  I have an old phone."  (flip phone)

"I got the nickname Dead Head because of my initials and because I took advantage of a deadheading loophole while working on the railroad."

"My son says spending it is good but if more big companies like Microsoft and Dell keep adding bitcoin, wouldn't the value go up?  I used to have a Dell.  I know them.  So why is spending it better than keeping it?"

"I couldn't tell much difference after it changed because I didn't have much money.  You couldn't go to the bank and get gold or anything before that, but you didn't hear as much about money and inflation... I mean I was working long hours so maybe I didn't see the difference.  It seems like they could just print more money after that.  How about the bitcoin.  If they just keep making more then the value will go down for my bitcoin too, right?"
Edit for additional info:  "The value of gold started going up after Nixon took us off the gold standard because it was no longer a set price.  My buddies used to mine for gold and sell it elsewhere before Nixon took us off the gold standard."
