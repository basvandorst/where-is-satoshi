Subtle reminder for new guys (at least newer than me): if you are not a seasoned trader, you'll probably fuck up trying to time ATH and bottom of a dip. If there's a dip, don't panic, it'll come back up. If there's a dip, hodl, and buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:34:21

Well if you just want to hodl it, a wallet is safer. If you want to trade it, the exchange is faster. I'd be an idiot to say exactly where I keep how much of what.

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:47:29
So when you place a limit order, you set the amount you want to purchase or sell, in BTC, and the price/rate you want to purchase or sell at. If the market price drops below or climbs above that limit, the limit should be met. So yes, if the price of btc continuously rose to $16100, then fell to $16000, one could place a limit sell of 1.0BTC at $16080, and a limit buy at $16020, and repeatedly make $60. However, the market rarely behaves that way, and it's a huge gamble to try and time that out. If it were easy and predictable, everyone would do it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:28
I know, I can't wait.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:50:41
I bought the dip at about $84, and right this second it's at 98.02 was 104 earlier. Go to coinbase or gdax for live price tracking
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:22:30
Yeah, during the last one I had a stoploss at 9900. Filled at 9845, while everything was unresponsive.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:29:14
Exactly, so they need the price to increase forever, or at least stabilize. With these high bubbles, it's very possible for enough people to get emotional and panic sell, quickly passing whatever backing coinbase has. So, they freeze the price, halt sales, and wait for sellers heads to cool.

Why not 10M?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:37
You will, but ya know... it's your money. I sold most btc earlier and moved more to LTC...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:50
At this point I'm aiming for what the dip does to LTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:58:05
Which is why they freeze sales when there's a large dip. Let everyone cool off.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:40:41
Isn't that like, remarkably close to, or exactly the same as that scene in "The Big Short" with whats his name, and Selena Gomez... where they were explaining how synthetic CDOs rekt the economy?

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:09:42
I've made more off ltc. I guess I would have made more if I left everything in BTC, at this moment, but if either LTC follows this trend, or btc is a bubble, then for me LTC will continue to pay off more.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:46:09
It's a reliable way to buy high, sell low, and lose money. It's gambling.

Coinbase is great for people who want to buy, hodl, and not worry about the daily ups and downs of the market.

@_date: 2017-12-06 14:43:56
Hmm 12k last night, 13k this am... surely this won't dip drastically, causing coinbase and krakken to shutdown during the dip, preventing me from buying more... surely.

Fiat is the real bubble
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:04:53
I mean, I think crypto's biggest flaw or hold back at this moment is the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:54:32
You can try. That's basically what Wall street does. If you can guess right, there's huge money to be made. Otherwise, you'll be chasing the price upwards.

...shit it really is a bubble.
@_date: 2018-10-12 05:01:42
just remember that if BTC/USD moons while the value of the  dollar is crashing, the value of bitcoin isn't really increasing. I would guess that in an isolated instance (like Venezuela), buying crypto (or any stable, usable currency) prior to your home currency tanking would be a great hedge against inflation. 
However, if we're talking about an '08 crash, especially if one were to imagine we didn't inject capitol into the banking market: banks stop lending, companies can't borrow for daily operations, bank runs, etc., that could cause an actual collapse of the global economy. In that case, bitcoin wouldn't be any more useful than paper money. But I'm not an economist or anything.
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:19:35
right, and the rumor today is that this is it officially decoupling from USD. @ $0.96 right now, so either a bunch of people are getting fucked/lucky trading a coin at 4% below it's supposed value, or a lot more people are getting fucked trading/hodling a coin at 96% above it's real value.

If there were a serious war coming (or other shtf scenario), gold is only slightly less pointless than bitcoin. Assuming the entire planet doesn't lose internet, your bitcoin would still be there once connectivity resumed. Gold would be more useful as it could still be used while internet is down, and you're much more likely to be able to buy supplies, but expect its value to thin. The real ticket during a shtf event would be ammo, food, medicine, and comfort items like smokes/toilet paper.
