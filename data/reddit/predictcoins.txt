Yeah the graph still needs a bit of work, but it will eventually show the price on mouseover too. 
Thanks for the suggestion!

* You're actually voting in advance for the next hour, so you can change your mind anytime until the end of the current hour.  If you click the "How to Play" link on the site it's all explained in there :)
* The time should be in your local timezone (it's detected using javascript)

You can change it to "All Time" etc if you hover over the "Today" link. It's currently ordered by most correct predictions within the time frame, but that could be changed in the future to success rate % or a points-based scoring system.

Good point, will add that as a user setting when settings are working ;)
@_date: 2013-05-19 22:24:34
Yep, that will be an option eventually :)
