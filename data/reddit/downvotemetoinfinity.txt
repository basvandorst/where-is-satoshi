Thank god. I didn't want my first BTC purchase to go wrong. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 09:27:26
It's a plastic bowl.. 
I have no other place to put them right now.

Not everybody mines, right? 
So in the end, everybody else has to buy the coin. For them, it is already premined. 
But yeah, just realised chances of scam are much higher with premined.

I appreciate the humor, but people lost some serious BTC in there. 
Spare a thought or two about the seriousness of the situation. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 03:59:01
I put them in a plastic bowl since I currently have no place to put them. 
The quality is really good. Go for it.

This isn't only about Bitcoin, it's about every cryptocurrency. 
We fear what we don't understand. It's basic human nature. People need to know about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. 
The main obstacle is Internet. Half of the world doesn't have Internet, how do we provide payment facilities to them? 
All the bad news coming with Bitcoin isn't helping either.

Definitely. 1NmXRcV1u35KjrhKidm5aZLEwFpcedZcz3
I know right? They're really good, but I'm falling short of just $2 of Bitcoin. I'd really appreciate it if you could help me out.
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:01:52
Ah. 
Their website mentioned half that time, so I was a bit concerned. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:14:00
That's exactly what I'm trying to say. 
I don't have BTC myself, but I'll be glad to help you out in a other way. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:32:31
Bitcoin needs to do some good to cover up all the bad that's been following it. 
Simple as that. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:38:17
Oh man. 
This is extremely sad. 
But, are we really that dependent of them? Can't* we survive without the Bitcoin Foundation? 
@_date: 2014-03-29 06:07:21
Thank you. 
Transaction is being confirmed right now :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:46:17
Having to report every transaction kills a major feature of Bitcoin - anonymous transactions. 
Bitcoin is a currency, not a collectible. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:28:09
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH! 
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:25:37
Uh, you do realise you're already registered with the bank, that's why it's so simple, right?
You've provided the bank each and every detail about yourself. Your personal details, yourhousing details, work details, list of every purchase you make. They hold your money and provide interest, and provide loans. They know almost everything about you. 
Robocoin ATM's on the other hand need to redo this procedure with you. It's irritating no doubt about it, but you've already been though such a thing with fiat ATM's. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:37:07
First of all, refer to this post:  as a similar case took place yesterday.

Feel free to test the new change tip
@_date: 2014-04-09 09:14:55
I saw this video of these two people buying Bitcoin. One was Asian, one was American. 
The Asian did all the buying. After submitting all the documents, palm scan, etc, he was good to go. 
He came back to the ATM later on, and all he had to do was get his palm scanned. 
That's pretty much it. It's not like he's submitting his documents each and every time. Saves you the hassle of even carrying a card or some sort :)
The one-time registration is tedious, but AFAIK the next visit to the ATM becomes smooth. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:55:16
Anyone wants to test out the change tip? 
Feel free to do so here on this comment! 
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:15:36
Whoops. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:14:04
Well can you tip me too?
I'd love a 0.01 BTC tip.
@_date: 2014-04-03 09:12:04
Get lost. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 09:25:50
Wow, this article is spot on. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:04:57
Dude. 
0.5 BTC is a lot. 
If it's a small sum for you, tip me 0.5 BTC then. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:03:45
Nope. 
Mt. Gox, the new SSL vulnerability, etc are still being talked about. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:47:45
I had no idea that existed. Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-04-08 08:38:48
If you make them, maybe tip me too? 
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:42:25
Thank you. I appreciate it :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:49:25
Sorry I couldn't help you any more. 
I'd suggest you switch to Electrum..
@_date: 2014-04-09 13:56:58
What exactly do you mean by 


How will this be any different from the other wallets out there? 
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:58:06
Crap. 
You have another one of these?
