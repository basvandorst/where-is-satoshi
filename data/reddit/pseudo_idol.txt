I would buy a few if you made some.

I just logged into the app and [it gave me 2 choices]( Covert my btc to usd, or transfer my btc to another wallet.

I would only buy directly from their [official website]( It reduces the risk of tampering by 3rd parties.  Also they are on sale this weekend.

I placed an instant buy order which normally gets processed in under a minute. After an hour of status pending, I checked their [status site]( which said everything was operational.  I contacted live chat support after my order was pending for over an hour.  They merely said my order would go through "shortly".  When I inquired how long shortly was in terms of minutes, hours or days, they said they don't know....
3.5 hours later my order got processed.  Luckily it appears I was charged the market rate when the order was processed, not placed, which is good as the price dropped $6 in that time-span.

Same here.  I am trying to log in and the verification text doesn't come through.  I then selected the option to call me with a code, but the voice just said "Sorry, an application error has occurred."

Saw it, laughed my ass off.
