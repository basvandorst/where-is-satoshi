Honestly, all signs point to another great increase in value.  
The only thing that could prevent that would be the supplanting of Bitcoin, and that is unlikely to happen for two reasons: 
  
1. The name _Bitcoin_ has become to cryptocurrency what _Pepsi_ is to cola.  
  
2. Bitcoin has become the foundation of hundreds of alternate cryptocurrencies. Nearly all of them are measured by their value in Bitcoin.

They pray every day that the plebs don't discover what an absolute joke the U.S. "economy" is.

The tone reminds me Bittrex.  
Holding funds &amp; making withdraws difficult at will.  
They too are trying to push for complete ID verification for crypto withdraws, even when fiat was never involved; citing U.S. laws as the reason, even though those laws don't apply to non-fiat transactions.

Some are bots &amp; shills, some are careless/lazy people parroting bots &amp; shills (or corrupt mainstream media) instead of researching.

Actually the problem is that the memes make bitcoin supporters look like a bunch of wannabe wall street cunts who are just looking to increase their personal wealth at any cost.

He had issues in the past but was a completely legitimate businessman, in full compliance with the law when he was raided.  
He was raided using above-the-law mafia-style powers to send a message to anyone who cuts in on their action (intentionally or unintentionally) without giving them a hefty taste.  
Same powers that send people to prison for _legally_ refusing to pay income tax.

Maybe the global government that's been forming over the past century and is nearing completion. Just a few more countries to invade/destabilize/destroy then there will be no one left to oppose it, and no refuge for dissidents.

The psychopaths in power depend heavily on the public's inability to remember much of anything beyond three years into the past.

There's a finite amount of bitcoins. The number of people buying &amp; using is increasing faster than that finite amount is entering the market. This increases the value of bitcoin. And it's only going to get more extreme. The value is going to go way, way higher.

Agreed. I think it'll start going back up before 2.8K

If he's crying because he could have bought more if he had just waited another day, it's fact. Otherwise, it's nonsense.

I wish. Would love the opportunity to make up for missing the boat back when price was low.  
Not gonna happen though. Before it hits $2.5K it'll already be on its way back to the $4K range where it'll continue to climb with the usual temporary dips.

US gov was hijacked by wealthy psychopaths long ago.  
It's like a mafia organization wearing an Uncle Sam mask. Only worse.

This is the year that bitcoin hits 10K.
