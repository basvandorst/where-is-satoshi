Put in something the description it should work.

These are the decisions that I am burdened with daily. My time is spent working my butt off long hours and days because given my circumstances i very well may not retire. My wife's needs outweigh the need to cease working. I could care less it's just something we all hope for someday. I still have some years left in me and believe you're only as old as you feel. Being around younger redditors talking about what we're talking about does make me feel like there is hope not only for me but I'm eager to see this next generation completely shake up the world. This is only the beginning. You are all so awesome!

I want to do 5k maybe not all at once but not sure which place to buy into. There's a lot of websites but from my research and help here MtGox and bitstamp seem to be the ones people accept. 
What would you do?

And here we go to launch past 1000

I've looked into a mutual fund but the obviousness to the risk involved is the sheer growth this year which is why I'm leaning towards Bitcoin. The worst thing that I think will eventually happen is when the next crash is. Money is a really interesting topic because everyone and everything revolves around it even though with said money what it's really all about is taking care of the ones you love. That's my goal, wife's medical bills have had us consider all avenues.

I know google but could you elaborate?  So there's now a subset of Bitcoin?  Wouldn't the risk be increased?  Although would that mean greater return?

Posted pm doesn't seem legit though. 
Just in case

This is why I'm asking for advice so I greatly appreciate all of you who are taking the time to lend me an ear. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:59:17
Is it literally months for like any amount?

I showed this to my wife and she started crying but it's one of those good kind of cries. What you did is amazing now my goal is to understand it. I have been doing a lot of research trying to make sure to not get scammed and I think the paper wallet is good idea but is it easy to transfer say from a place like coin base to a paper wallet etc. Eventually I'd like to have many coins in a wallet but would you put them all in one place?
Thank you by the way, your generosity will be remembered and I hope I can tell others once I get educated, how to put their money into this. From what I understand the more people who use it the better as it is becoming "accepted" and I think it's the right time to learn. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:47:43
I sure hope you're right.

That's the general consensus. Hard to not bankrupt and take out a bunch of debt and just take a chance. There's people out there that most likely have done so and profited. The scary part is when this euphoric rise will level out. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 08:59:05
Who exactly are you trying to convince?  From an outside perspective someone seems like they are profiting off doge but likely pump and dump and all the late entries sitting there wondering why their coins are worthless. 
For the current level of adaptation of bitcoin it shocks me people are wasting their time promoting alternate coins. For any coin to succeed where bitcoin could fail bitcoin must fall to a new phenomenon of success from some random coin. 
I feel like we're still too early to even call bitcoin success so all of this energy going into these alternate coins could be attention on bitcoin and spreading knowledge.  
Looks like you're trying to convince yourself that this  is your get rich quick scheme. Unfortunately if you are late to the party you've gone and missed that opportunity, like 99% of the holders of essentially any coins including bitcoin. 
We're still at the blind investment stage and not even close to public adaptation yet people are wasting away trying to get a quick buck on alt coins. 
Awesome.

Love all these scare posts trying to promote panic selling. I'm really new to this but most of these panic sell scare news posts are pathetic chances to buy in cuz you're late to the game, think of it from this perspective:  BUY MORE before it's 1000 a share tomorrow, before it's 10000 next year (obvious speculation) but the point is people are still buying in every second you not buying in now you're letting other people buy in before you. Don't consider it lost money because if you're serious about Bitcoin you would see the bigger long term picture here. -oldguy

Thank you both!

My fate will not be decided in a single evening but I am very appreciative of the advice I've been given because it's hard to put this out there. Everyone's life is different I'm just along for the ride. This has been a very difficult conversation with my wife who has been my best friend for the majority of my life and slowly but surely we're grasping the concept of this hopefully still in its infancy. All of the help here is priceless and we both think the reason Bitcoin is successful is because of how many helpful people support it and want others to have their lives enriched by learning about it earlier vs later. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:58:50
Bitstamp eh?  I see that people have had trouble withdrawing from MtGox does that happen with the other larger sites?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:40:27
Oh okay I didn't know I could do that, so it would mirror the 401k process but hoping for much greater return. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:03:40
Thank you that means everything to us.

Watch this kid make the news. Someone who knows the right ppl, get this kid to tell his story in front of the world. Once a local news picks this up and there's video, this will make national in no time. Good luck this is the best awe story of the day, combined with the space announcement this is a very positive perspective.   -oldguy
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:02:51
So let's say I decide to put 5k in from said 401k. Would you buy in through coinbase?  Does MtGox have a different "worth" for Bitcoin?  
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:57:59
If I were to have done this last night (still waiting for check) I would have made some money already. I know this isn't supposed to be quick gains but it's hard to ignore the fact that earlier the better in terms of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:56:26
That's a great idea I was thinking about doing 5k initially then see where it goes but it's just scary in general with all aspects of investing, not knowing where the future will take us. From my perspective I see this going to 10k or even to 100k per Bitcoin simply because it's becoming easier every day to justify it. People are realizing the legitimacy of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:48:15
Didn't see that option already pulled out I fully believe Bitcoin is the future. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:26:24
I like you. You spread happiness.
