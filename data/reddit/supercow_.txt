You get capitol gains tax on any profits withdrawn over your original investment. 
So if you bought $200 worth of bitcoin last December and got 0.25 coins and then decided to cash out what 0.25 coins are worth now (say it's $4000) you'd pay capital gains on $3800 of it (your profit). If you just pulled out $200 (original investment in dollars) you wouldn't owe taxes on that I don't think.

When I create a Stop sell order on Gdax it says "This order may fill at a price less favorable than the stop price. Are you sure you would like to continue?" What does that mean?

Why is bitcoin cash valued so high?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:02:18
It's hard when the fees are so high and the system is so slow. I tried to make a newegg purchase and the fee was like $40 and the transaction didn't make it on time for bitpay/newegg's 15 minute window.

Any idea where to get one of these? They seem sold out everywhere or marked out for double their listed cost.

This reads like the script of some cool sci-fi movie. 
I also think there is a lot of interesting truth in there.
