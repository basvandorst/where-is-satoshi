Bitcoin is not intended for use with centralised services. It can of course, and of course will, be used on centralised services but you seem to be confusing Bitcoin itself with how people use Bitcoin.
If you want to store bitcoin you do that privately, if you want to trade bitcoin like a stock market then you use a centralised service. There's a huge difference.
@_date: 2016-04-06 12:15:01
Any bitcoin wallet is compatible with all other bitcoin wallets/services. Mycelium is pretty good as a mobile app, Ledger is a cost-effective hardware wallet, web wallets are for holding small amounts of funds - Xapo is pretty good. For desktop the most robust is bitcoincore but it's a little clunky, people tend to prefer Electrum.
As for buying bitcoin in the UK, the banks are still blocking it so you'll struggle to link your UK bank account - you have to use options such as bank transfers (peer to peer), international transfers to exchanges or pay a premium and pay with a card.

You could get a Xapo debit card in Euro currency. It takes BTC from your wallet when you spend Euros with the card.

You could attach a drive to it, set-up a large swapfile (since there's not enough RAM) and run bitcoincore with some heavy pruning turned on. It would be slow but I reckon it'd run.

And in the case of a web wallet where possible generate the address yourself and import the priv key, if you're handling sums that are large to you then knowing how you generated the key (i.e. with something reliable like bitcoincore) and having a copy of said key gives a lot of piece of mind when using things like web wallets purely because they are convenient.

I think it is sensible to have a hard limit if nothing else as a kind of checkpoint / rule / reference point... totally free and open is great and all but there's a reason some general rules and limits are applied to just about every facet of life. The alternative is chaos.
If that hard node limit were changed to say 100Mb rather than 20Mb then your described scenario would effectively the case, but at least there is something there too. Remember, the core protocol is not just for miners - it's the nodes too.. if we had no limit at all and some clown managed a single 250Mb block we'd lose a lot of nodes and it would be a problem that could have been easily avoided.

You won't get a 20% markup. 10% maybe at the right time.

You must be looking in the wrong place then. If the wallet is open and lists at least one receive address then somewhere on your computer is the wallet.dat
Other commentors have a better idea of where the user data folder is on Windows - or you could just search the contents of C:/documents and Settings/ for wallet.dat (including hidden files)
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:26:17
Fidor are a good bank, I didn't look at the FX rate but since most banks charge £5-15 for a SEPA it's still cheaper through Fidor. The best part though is your bank has no idea where your money is going, and FidorUK don't care at all if you buy BTC.

It gets passed on anyway unless the peer's min relay fee blocks it. What you need is for a miner to include it in a block and a miner isn't incentivised to listen to zero-fee transactions.. though, in many cases your tx will go through eventually.

You've got a core fact wrong, Gavin brought up the idea of increasing the block size a lot more than a few days before the XT stuff started.
I don't see him as a dictator whatsoever - somebody had to stand up and get this debate going before it got too late. He was probably expecting this kind of Reddit war and personal attacks so good on him for sticking his neck out for the good of the protocol. He is probably the most suited dev to try to manage this as he is very familiar with the code and protocol but doesn't code as much any more so he has the time to write well researched blog posts and have endless discussions.

It seems to be the case that people trust well known exchanges more than they trust themselves. I know there are many simple and secure options for storing bitcoin yourself - but seemingly most people would rather use a centralised service to handle it for them.
As the tools, community and users mature I'm sure we'll see more users doing it "properly" - but of course there will also be newcomers who take the same route as existing non-savvy users.
Bitcoin is actually very simple to use once you're used to it IMO but when you've got 64 BTC and aren't used to it I can see why people resort to familiar web services.

@_date: 2015-12-16 17:03:45
UK banks actively block all bitcoin businesses so there is no option other than an international transfer (e.g. SEPA) which will take days and incur fees.
BTC-e can withdraw to cards, or at least it could - you could have a look there if you won't use LBC or one of the other p2p markets.

They can already choose the max block size up to the max block size allowed by the core protocol. That won't change if the max block size changes.
However, they have to stay within the bounds of the core protocol - there's nothing stopping them editing their node to allow 50 Mb blocks, but the network won't accept any of the blocks they mine that are above the core max block size.
So no, miners don't need to all agree on the same limit.. but they do have to stick to the bitcoincore defined limits.
@_date: 2015-06-28 23:39:33
Mycelium is safe to use yes. 
Get started by buying a small amount, localbitcoins.com is often the first place people use - make sure you buy from a seller with truly excellent feedback even if their price is slightly higher.
ChangeTip is a way to send people very small amounts to let them know you appreciate the content they have added to the Internet - whatever that content may be.
Google is your friend. But remember that bitcoin transactions are irreversible unlike most other payment formats, so keep that in mind - as with anything "if it looks too good to be true, it probably is".
Enjoy, have a play with a small amount of bitcoin, try some different wallets (bitcoin.org is a good source of trustworthy wallets). It's easy once you've done it a couple of times and you'll soon want to learn more.

Bearwhale sold 30k coins a while back and could have bought them back much cheaper (probably has).. leaving them with plenty in their pocket which you could call making them rich (given they could still own the same number of BTC they started with).

I didn't know of that feature on Gox, I guess that explains why it's still perpetuating 12mo after it closed. I've still never used it but I could have interacted with people that have. Still counts as a false positive in my books tho.
I guess I read your service the wrong way around for MintPal.. people are still using the same addresses they used back then therefore there will still be some tx.

You're probably being downvoted by blockchain.info haters. 
To be fair to the downvoters, blockchain.info does have a different of the unconfirmed tx set than most, it's as if they restart/flush their nodes every hour or something... a node that has been running for a few days without a restart will contain more unconfirmed tx - likely ones that will never be confirmed but essentially BCi don't show the true tx set.

It's worth remembering that Bitcoin is not **for** miners, it's **for** users. It's not a tool for techies and companies to make money, it's a tool to unite the globe in a single non-commercial, non-government payment system accessible to all, even the unbanked.

The problem is light/lite nodes aren't any use to upload and/or verify txs in the way Bitcoin is supposed to do. However, pruning will help with this and effectively there will be a "full" node, a "pruned" node and a "light" node. As far as I understand it a pruned node will still be beneficial to the network.
@_date: 2015-06-22 02:52:19
Addresses contain zero or more input (and output) transactions. Like an account on a ledger. There's no real difference for a casual user other than when it relates to tx fees (which are handled by most wallets automatically), but there is a distinct difference for power users and non-monetary uses of the blockchain for example.

Lookup the tx on a block explorer, look at the fee, the tx size and you can guesstimate whether it's legit or not. If confirms are being slow for whatever reason you should be able to gauge whether that's because the tx is with an insufficient fee or whether it's just slow confirms at that time. If it's just slow confirms - it'll go through fine (unless Peter Todd gets his way).
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:11:36
No the other tx in your wallet cannot be know. Unless you link them. You might send coins from 2-3 addresses to another address - linking them. You might send coins on different occasions to the same recipient address - linking them. You might move coins around your own addresses - linking them.
That's the point. Using new addresses for each tx gives you more privacy and more control, but it doesn't make it some anonymous cash system if you don't understand what goes on with inputs/outputs.

I can confirm that it's very possible to spend a 0-confirm input.. in fact you can usually get away with a few, e.g. 0.5 single input, send 0.1 to X and 0.4 change goes to Y, then send 0.1 from Y to Z with 0.3 change into A... and so on.
Here's a random example I pulled from the blockchain..
tx1 from 14 to 1Fv with change to 11:
tx2 one minute later from 11 to 1Fv with change to 1Fb:
Both have the same number of confirms so they both confirmed in the same block.

You get yourself a bitcoin wallet (  ).
You buy some bitcoin, how depends on your location. localbitcoins.com is a good place to start but always choose a seller with excellent and extensive feedback.
To spend it you use a website/shop that accepts it and using your wallet or a separate mobile wallet you simply scan (or copy and paste, or click) to pay.
It makes sense once you've done it a couple of times.

This thread will likely get deleted for begging but I'll post anyway.
It's the government and banks that make it hard to get hold of, if you have experience you know that it isn't hard to get hold of. The high fees some exchanges charge are because of the hoops they have to jump through, else they'll just be making a loss. When the banks etc. give in then there will be more options and less red tape - I know it's crazy but you can't blame Bitcoin, Bitcoin itself is free, open and decentralised - it's the converting USD/GBP/EUR/etc to BTC that is the hurdle, because of the banks and authorities. It shouldn't be that way and it won't be that way forever, but at the moment it is that way. Nothing the Bitcoin community can do about that other than keep innovating and patiently waiting.
I'm sorry your experience of Bitcoin was poor, but your experience was not with Bitcoin it was with some company(ies) that deals with Bitcoin.. not Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:15:11
This. A user with an old/legacy backup of a wallet used it to restore their coins and there was a bug (overflow) in the code which resulted in a small tx with a massive, massive fee. Thankfully the block was mined by a good pool and the erroneous tx fee was returned to the unfortunate bitcoiner.

@_date: 2015-12-06 22:20:42
The same applies for BTC-e.. people tend to do crypto-in, crypto-out.. so their USD rate compared with other major USD exchanges is often lower because people go there to short BTC temporarily. It's also likely easier to cash-out in fiat then it is to cash-in with fiat so again, overall sell pressure creates a lower rate as opposed to other exchanges which have a kind of equilibrium.

The tweak is really simple, people just can't agree on what number to change it to - i.e. how far to look into the future.

When you flush your node it doesn't pick up the current unconfirmed tx set, it just adds new ones as it sees them being broadcast. The rest of the network handles the existing unconfirmed ones, plus if they make it into a block your node can still validate them without previously knowing about them so it doesn't need to know about them.

This is good advice. Coding your own Bitcoin stuff is possible for any level of programmer, but that's part of the problem - a bit like why people hate on PHP.

Well, it doesn't need to do 20+ tps at the moment does it, so it's not set-up to do so. 
Hence the blocksize debate etc. Some people want to make it so that it is set-up to handle 20+ tps ASAP (which is a really simple modification to the protocol) and some think it's better to keep it smaller for now so that it remains light on resource requirements (and a couple of other reasons). Bitcoin could handle ~200tps with that a simple blocksize tweak before it hits the next limit (32Mb comms limit) and even that limit is fairly trivial to change.
It's a balance between capacity, resource usage and spam deterrents not a dick-swinging "look how many txs I can handle" thing.

I think you misunderstand how exchanges work. They are essentially HFT p2p type services, bob places a sell order for the 2 BTC he deposited...  Alice buys 2 BTC with the USD she has on her account. Bob gets the USD, Alice gets the BTC, the exchange keeps a small %.
Maybe there's a bit of fractional reserves in use but in general when you buy/sell BTC you're buying/selling to a buyer/seller not some fictional exchange database.

As far as I know the compression/decompression overheads are prohibitive. i.e. It saves a little space but the resource usage involved negates that... the same reason why the blockchain data isn't compressed on-disk.
One of the biggest concerns with a block size increase is the additional disk usage and CPU/RAM usage that goes with that. Involving compression algorithms would cause similar CPU/RAM usage increase concerns but would free up far less tx space.

The block size limit is a limit for the total size of the transactions in a block, transactions vary in size depending on their complexity (remember that one transaction can contain many inputs and outputs so is not necessarily one transaction). 
Paying higher fees than others proportionally to the size of your transaction lets you jump the queue for confirmations, put simply.
A higher block size will allow more data to be written to the blockchain, if more transactions are made - if transaction sizes don't rise the blockchain won't grow any quicker than it does with a 1Mb limit.
If there was no limit, as there wasn't in the early days, spammers/attackers could potentially create huge blocks by spamming - every node has to store those blocks for a long time so it makes sense to have a limit. It is considered an anti-spam limit.
Some people believe the block size should be limited so that users have to pay higher fees to get fast confirms, incentivising miners. Others believe bitcoin should be very cheap to use and that nodes and miners should handle the higher resource usage.

It should also be pointed out that UK registered companies must display their company registration number.

You underestimate how bad the internet is in locations other than your own. The UK has decent Internet, we've got Fibre and 4G and all those modern services. But, a sizeable portion of the UK doesn't get any more than 500 kbit/s upload and to get more than 800 kbit/s you (in most cases) need fibre - which is not available in many, many area.
And that's the UK - think of the other ~200 countries in the world.
Also, data caps are an issue.. let's say blocks often become 4Mb as they often become 1 Mb nowadays - that's something like 16 Gb of downloads alone per month - you're of course uploading to peers too and have your usual Internet traffic too - that is going to add up to likely 50Gb+/mo...  a 40Gb/mo cap even in the UK is not uncommon on basic services.
TL;DR:  You may have 30 mbit/s upload and I do too, but the majority of the world dreams of 3 mbit nevermind 30!

@_date: 2015-06-21 23:31:05
Because $30 is a small amount you'll be best to use a broker/peer-to-peer system like localbitcoins.com (bank transfer for best rates).. I hear bitquick.co is popular too.. or, find a BTM (Bitcoin ATM).
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:39:30

I suspect if he'd have done a BIP in the beginning he'd have had exactly this type of "dictator" response from Reddit and others, because he didn't discuss it with users/miners/children first. If there were any clear winning method from the discussions I'm sure he'd have jumped at writing a BIP ASAP.
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:40:38
Maybe they are testing their pool software or simply moving coins to a different machine/wallet.
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:36:55
No because they can link your transactions if they wanted to even if you don't mix inputs yourself. Unless you create a new account every single time.
Bitcoincore involves no third parties, that's important for privacy.

It's in GBP with a card. The Coinbase price was slightly better than Bittylicious/LBC and it was instant.. but as I say, limited amounts.
@_date: 2015-06-03 02:00:14
Time to change where you get your bitcoin from. Plenty of options, if Coinbase are causing you trouble - take your business elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:07:43
Quite a few exchanges/services will instantly send funds out after you have deposited, some may take a while to confirm - not all will go through in the same block. But I guess at least the tx is published so it's probably quicker than waiting for a confirm and then publishing the tx (and also easier to program the software).
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:21:58
252 bytes is pretty small (a basic tx) for such a detailed and secure message for want of a better word. I'm not entirely sure but I suspect that combining transactions (like exchanges do) results in a lower bytes-per-output figure due to sharing overhead - just like ZIPing 20 JPEGs which are already compressed saves you a few bytes due to the repeated JPEG headers.
Really, the block size issue is not that big an issue.. there are just a lot of opinions!
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:41:53
Meh. It's more of an issue that the media call them "Blockchain" not "Blockchain Ltd" (or whatever they are now).

Internet mate. Internet. You didn't update your firmware when you rebooted your Trezor. Your computer, drivers or Internet had a glitch probably.
Edit: It's only because money was involved. If eBay/Google/Netflix/Whatever failed you'd turn off and on again and think nothing of it.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:32:38
You've installed the official Bitcoin wallet "Bitcoin Core". It doesn't mine or produce any coins, it is just used for sending/receiving/storing bitcoin.
The large download was the software downloading the blockchain, which is Bitcoin's ledger and the reason Bitcoin is so important.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:50:07
Look your public IP up on  or test your port with Shields Up. They'll let you know if the port is working.
I doubt your ISP is blocking VPNs or bitcoin ports. It'll just be a configuration issue somewhere on your computer or router.
Edit:  Default Litecoin port is 9333 and default Namecoin is 8334

No, most nodes are run by bitcoin/blockchain businesses and enthusiasts.. as the blockchain grows it is possible the number of enthusiast nodes will decrease but you could similarly argue that as the blockchain grows adoption will grow - generating new enthusiasts.

But. Who's going to mine the old chain? Nobody. Certainly nobody with enough power to find regular blocks at this difficulty level. The old chain won't work properly at all and fudging this and that to make it work on some level is not a good idea IMO - we want inexperienced users to notice there's an issue and upgrade.

Because it's going to cost them a chunk of money to run that test so it's not going to happen every day, plus you can always circumvent the stress test by adding a little extra fee. Wallets may even begin to detect network congestion and automatically increase fees for users.
Plus, I'll say it again, it's the equivalent of more like 20 tps they are claiming to be doing.

Namecoin because a large portion of Bitcoin miners are also merge-mining it. Litecoin also has a pretty huge hashrate compared to any other altcoin and is well established and developed - but it's hard to quantify versus Bitcoin. PoS coins don't really count.

Nice to see, while the US takes the completely wrong approach to regulating the market hopefully here in the UK we can do it right and we need non-Bitcoin industry players supporting that.. the correspondence that I've had with the government during this year is highly positive.

@_date: 2014-06-25 03:03:35
I commend you for effort and wish you success. But the exchange rate and KYC kills it for many imo - might as well use LBC dot com (or similar). If you want to pay with cash it has to be ultra-convenient and somewhat whimsical, else you'll just do a BACS and if you want to buy in volume you'll certainly use BACS.

I agree and I have been using them for peanut amounts for a couple of months just to test them out, my orders do fill. If we all stick a little bit on there and setup some orders the volume will soon rise :)
Deposits and withdrawals work and the site is quick. It seems to me that they are doing everything carefully and properly. I haven't got round to using the API but it looks comprehensive and WebSockets is a nice touch.
Two notes from my experience using it..  BTC withdrawals are manual and therefore slow (by slow I mean around 24hrs depending on time requested and also not at weekends).. Secondly, the site is useless for quick draw trading as the UI doesn't seem designed for that.. it's for long and not short. Using the API you'll be fine to short.

Three points I feel compelled to make..
1) The US gov seem genuinely scared of this case, in that if enough truths become public they will lose and the whole façade fall apart. It has to be said that these charges all seem a little thin and that they are being forced through with hammers, distraction and smoke.
2) Watch the video. You'll click and see it's a 40 minute video. Don't click away, give this lady this measly morsel of your time. It's the least that you can do and is worth it.
3) We need a separate donation address direct to Ross's commissary, I want Ross to have as many luxuries as are possible in prison. I'm sure others would like this too.

My fledgling business also exchanges cash for bitcoin in the form of gift vouchers sold in shops, similar to an ATM in many ways. It doesn't require ID verification. I sell a lot more than expected (it's only been live for 3 months).
I contacted various government departments asking for advice and assistance with regulation before selling anything. I have been given a clear-as-day "go ahead" with zero ID verification required. Do I still expect a visit from the feds one day, yes, certainly. I'm not looking forward to it, but I'll have a folder full of documentation ready for them. I am not doing anything wrong under current UK laws, what people do with their bitcoin is up to them.
Good luck Charlie, you win some, you lose some.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:46:14
How are the two remaining parties going to communicate without the site?
I actually don't know how these multisig markets work, perhaps the buyer will get to keep their coins and it will be the vendors who have shipped that will lose out.
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:44:55
Say someone imports the private key from a cold wallet into some wallet software, sends 2,000 of their 10,000 to somewhere then deletes their wallet thinking the remaining 8,000 will still be in the original cold address which they have the paper backup of. 
However, the change from the transaction doesn't always go back into the original address but a newly generated change address which you would need to backup if you intend on wiping your wallet.

This or something like this yes. Maybe when clicking the link in the email the OP had to login again perhaps (Phishing) or some kind of DNS attack or dodgy Tor browser copy.. could be a lot of things.
Please do give BTCe all the details that you can though, their site is definitely secure because it's been around for years and is heavily used, we'd hear a lot more of this if it was insecure. They might even give you your BTC back as a bounty if it's a true bug/exploit.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:31:19
 Because the video explains it all in a way that you will never get from the media. Sure his mom is gonna have a bias, but so does the media, seems fair to take both sides into account. This video gives the "other half" in a single sitting.
 Innocent until proven guilty. Seems to me from what I know on the subject that Ross will never get proven guilty of any hitman related charge. Another reason to view the video.
@_date: 2015-05-01 00:54:05
Yup. Buy them. Peer-to-peer like localbitcoins.com or an exchange. If you use an exchange like Bitfinex to trade on then you can borrow funds using your bitcoin as collateral so you'd only need half a coin or so to trade with a whole coin.
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:16:08
I guess people in that area should stop using Bitcoin until it's sorted. It wouldn't take long at all for the media, users, Reddit, etc. to notice. People would try to help. Some nodes might get brief connections to the outside world, which would help.
Edit:  Plus, now that we [can put nodes in space]( it would take a lot to kill all possible Internet/node connections in a large area.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:29:56
Ripple and Stellar are trying to achieve this, but neither are particularly useful as yet (as far as I know).
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:35:12

bit-rated, OTC ratings, even LBC or BTCJam ratings serve pretty much the same purpose. Even signing a message from an address holding enough funds to backup your application would work to some extent.
Good question though.
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:51:23
"If you don't control your keys, you don't own your bitcoin" is the general thought behind it. You're using Coinbase like a bank but without all the government protection you get with trusting an actual bank.
That's not to say don't store them there, if you trust Coinbase to keep them safe for you (or safer than you trust yourself to keep them). Just remember it's a Coinbase I.O.U. you own rather than 4 BTC if you keep them with a 3rd party.
@_date: 2015-05-17 02:19:01
Feedback is there for a reason, it shouldn't be abused like this. It takes some time to run a LBC vendor account properly.. if you bought an account with quality feedback and then didn't provide a matching service you'd be wasting your money buying the account and pissing the buyers off. For example, some banks play strangely with other banks and take longer than usual to clear - you wouldn't know the specifics if you hadn't traded a bit on LBC.
My advice is to just build up the feedback yourself, it's easy to gain good feedback by buying coins and if you do your best to vend well then it won't take long to be in the main tier of listings rather than relegated to the lower tier.

Assuming all miners use nodes that utilises the patch there will be no mining on the fork of the chain that non-patched nodes would be on. Fork = splitting into two chains.. ideally every node would be patched and it wouldn't even fork because all nodes would continue to agree.
@_date: 2015-05-23 13:25:25
Ah, I didn't realise it was a tiny transaction. Yes, it's less likely to be confirmed. If you want to dig deeper into Bitcoin you could probably double-spend the transaction with a higher fee to force that initial tx to fail quicker, but I've not tried that personally.
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:35:40
Most merchants cash out instantly, it's well known. So for example every BitPay transaction will not benefit from this. The same applies if you bought some coins on LBC for example, you probably want to send them somewhere not just leave them in your LBC payment channel.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:33:40
No real problem but it did cause slow confirms for a lot of fairly standard txs. It also placed RAM and CPU load on nodes because of this. While it was an interesting test all we seem to have found out is that most miners stick to the default limits.

It's the 3% on non-domestic currency charges I don't like.. I could maybe live with the £4/mo fee. I was looking forward to using something like this when abroad so that I could do away with carrying and exchanging so much cash and remove the risk of something happening with my main bank card/account. If they operate in multiple currencies then they don't need to exchange anything so what is the large fee for. Especially when there's already a monthly fee.
Edit:  Afterthought, if I could get a card based in EUR even though my country is GBP then forget the fees it's a winner. Is that possible ?

Wouldn't a majority keep the bulk of us performing normally and force the ones who haven't included the consensus change to include it? else their nodes will not work with those that have (which is bound to include all the big services, miners, payment processors, etc).

It ain't "ready to launch" then. It takes more than code to launch an exchange.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:23:47
Thanks for the reply. 
I think it's safe to assume that not 100% of nodes will update/apply, there's bound to be at least one forgotten node running on some server somewhere. So therefore there will be a minority that [effectively] doesn't care about interoperability. If they aren't malicious, aren't used by miners or for pushing txs then they'll grind to a halt with no new blocks on that chain? Those nodes would be flagged/blocked by the 20mb nodes I assume because they won't agree with the majority of peers that a 20mb node is connected to.
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:34:24

I'll probably get downvoted for this, but as a British person who has a fair bit of education and experience in business - to some extent we feel the same about Americans. 
We are a stuffy, conservative nation that takes business very seriously and on the most part do everything properly and quietly to the point of being a little bit anal over it. Americans however are louder and more willing to embellish their pitches/reports/etc with exaggerations and perhaps white lies to get the deal done. That's just how Americans are, they are actively taught to be confident and "go get it" type attitude - but in our eyes it's deceit. A good example is TV commercials, it seems to be perfectly acceptable to completely bullshit in US ads, even the slightest misdirection or mild fabrication is heavily fined and usually quickly taken off-air in the UK.
Even subtle differences in cultures can be quite important and hard to understand because we are all brought up in our own cultures.

Namecoin would probably be better suited, you could put the name/ID in the TXT record instead. That way it would be quicker to update the address (I'm thinking DNS caching and propagation time) and you could also store other info, other addresses, etc.
@_date: 2015-05-02 00:05:43
Companies will use some of their own code but in general will use well tested open-source software because why reinvent the wheel if you can run it locally and scrutinise the code yourself. A good example of why is blockchain.info who had their own address generating code - which developed a bug and someone noticed, that person/people took a lot of funds from BCi wallets because the private key for addresses generated by BCi was able to be decoded thanks to the bug. I wouldn't be surprised if &gt;50% of the well known companies actually use bitcoind as their hot wallets.
@_date: 2015-05-16 01:35:37
Pruning. Headers-first. SPV/light clients. Moore's law.
It'll be fine. Storage isn't expensive. Even if it were, there are enough of us that think Bitcoin is amazing to keep it going (plus, miners need a node or two, and miners gonna mine).
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:37:17
Also Namecoin is intended for this type of use (which OneName is built on)...  the clients/services aren't great for Namecoin yet but getting there.

blockchain.info played/plays a large part in Bitcoin adoption.. not so much nowadays for before all these other web wallets it really was the best option. It hasn't got a "terrible" track record, they've just made a couple of mistakes - as have most bitcoin companies that have been around for a few years and have lots of users. I'll admit they seem to have dropped the ball these past 6-9 months or so but for newbies and small/temporary funds it is a good option.

That doesn't make much sense since you would want to use both domains to capture the most visitors anyway. The idea is to give people the choice, whether they are miners or visitors.

Fees / confirm times are to do with number of inputs, outputs and age of funds - i.e. the complexity of the transaction. I don't think the address itself on either side would make any difference.
Regarding your first point... obviously it's of no use as cold storage but for day-to-day funds it'll be fine if you're fine with reusing an address.

Yes just a simple max-size increase at 1456790400; (1 March 2016 00:00:00 UTC).
By the time that happens more could be added, I guess the thinking is this decision needs to be made fast and for that to happen it's also got to be simple. Bitcoin needs the majority of nodes using this code (or compatible code).

The only problem with changetip tips is that's not really Bitcoin, well, it is and it isn't..  if you use your own BTC with a wallet you can lookup the transactions on a block explorer and see how they work - with changetip it's mostly "off-chain" so it uses their internal database rather than the Bitcoin blockchain. It's still a good way to learn but you'll understand more doing "real" transactions.

Linux is no panacea but it is infinitely more secure that Windoze. You still need to be careful with backups, careful what you click on in browsers, careful what plugins/software you install, etc.
Linux is quite different to Windows, it's GUI is now quite similar but underneath it's different. If you use a Debian-based distro (which I recommend) then stick to the official Debian repositories and install all software via that and you'll be pretty stable and safe.
Linux Mint is a very good choice for newcomers to Linux. Ubuntu is a commercial piece of overrated shit that doesn't do Linux any justice, avoid that. If you're not fussy about a fancy GUI and don't need bleeding-edge drivers and libraries, Debian itself is a very good choice - ask any sysadmin which they use!

Seriously, how fast do you think it's going to grow?! A full node can be run on pretty much any old piece of crappy hardware right now, you can even fit the whole thing on a thumbdrive several times over. Sure, we'll hit 100Gb soon enough and a few years later maybe 200Gb.. but that's still peanuts. Even a 200Gb blockchain would still run on the same old piece of crappy hardware today's chain runs on, ~5 yrs down the line when it actually is 200Gb h/ware will have moved on, a 1Tb SSD will be cheap, there will be dedicated node h/ware (e.g. ChainBot, BitSeed) and probably a Raspberry Pi v3 by then.
A lot of fuss about nothing lately I think. The blockchain is going to grow, it always has been like that. Pruning will save the common user for massive data but power users and businesses will probably stick to the full data because a few hundred Gb of storage is no bother at all for most.

Because we keep getting close to 1Mb blocks, which is the current limit. In order to allow 1.1Mb blocks, 1.2Mb blocks, 1.3Mb blocks.. as the network grows... the limit has to be raised. 
There are several ways to raise it, how to do it is obviously a big issue at the moment. Gavin's proposal is probably the simplest and that I think was his aim when proposing it, it's as simple as making one change - a higher limit - a limit that will allow for the network to grow for many years, without having to go through all this discussion every time. If a better solution is found in say 2017 or 2018 then it can be applied then, but we would be best to do something soon as full blocks = delays (or higher fees).
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:57:06
Thanks again. Of course yes, it would be the old nodes that had the hump not the updated ones, because they'd keep being sent "invalid" blocks by the updated ones.

Pretty sure it depends how much free RAM the node's host has. A server with very little free RAM could end up using swap disks.

There's nothing to say you have to run the pruning node when it is created. You can run a node that doesn't prune. Both will agree on the current state of the blockchain so they'll work together fine.

BTC is just a payment method, so your invoices will be in USD/GBP/EUR whatever and if people want to pay with bitcoin that's just a payment method. The client ideally should pay using a hourly/daily average exchange rate at the time at which they pay - I certainly wouldn't denominate my fees in BTC.
How you account for it in your books is up to you so long as it's legit and makes sense. If you want to keep the BTC as BTC then for the sake of clarity you could do something in your books along the lines of "selling" the BTC, to credit the client's account with the invoice value and then "buying" BTC - just so it's clear in your books.

Mining is just numbers, no surprises, all miners do is generate random numbers based on a defined formula - when one finds a number that fits perfectly with the past block it is passed around all the nodes and verified - becoming a new block. Inside each block are some transactions, the fees used in those txs plus the 25 BTC block reward are paid out to the miner(s).
@_date: 2015-05-04 23:56:55
Disk space isn't really an issue though. It might get addressed at some point if it needs to be but even a 150Gb blockchain isn't difficult for most people to store.. you can fit that on a thumb drive already.
It's CPU + RAM people are most concerned with, resource wise. Bandwidth perhaps for some but again, tech moves quick and most users who would run a node have ample b/w already since it's not particularly b/w intensive.

Usually a crash is disk space (lack thereof) or RAM (lack thereof). Check your disks and watch your task manager while it starts up to monitor RAM usage.
It might be worth a blockdata rescan (--rescan on startup from commandline if I recall correctly). Or just move the data directory elsewhere and see if it starts up successfully and starts syncing. There's also a small chance that it was a bad download (corrupt some how) or your anti-virus is getting in the way... but check your resources and block data first before you do anything rash like disabling your AV.

As you may or may not know, No Such lAbs (trading on MPEx as S.NSA) has been for a while using BISP hardware to run Phuctor, a RSA key factorization service. 
As you can see, it employs bleeding edge Greek technology from 2`500 years ago, in the shape of Euclid's GCDi to try and find common factors among keys. Since there's about 4 million keys (a little under) in the bundle of publicly known keys that it is processingii, if you're even vaguely mathematically literate and even marginally aware of what exactly theoretical RSA promises, you would on the strength of this introduction expect a key to be factored just a little before Elvis comes back as the Queen of England. So did we. So did everyone else.iii
Imagine my surprise, and Stan's surprise, and everyone surprise - including your own once you find that yes, it has broken a pair of keys. 
And it didn't even need the whole 4 million set - only a shade shy of 200k. If we were to liniarly extrapolate - which we won'tiv - that'd mean we'll see dozens more before all of this is said and done.
And it's not even an ancient 1024 bit key. No, it's a spiffy, relatively recent 4096 bit key, made 2011-09-22 and owned by someone in all likelyhood you know, or at any rate have heard of. Yes, that's right - the key's in the GPG strong set.
It is our sad duty to inform Mr. H. Peter Anvin (hpa) that his key with fingerprint 51EA B526 D875 4202 2AA1 BC85 E99E F4B4 5122 1121 is factorizable. And the first factor - get a load of this - is 231. Which... yes, 231 = 3 * 77. Way, way, way too small to be appearing here. How exactly it got past Pollard-rho and why exactly is 231 a factor in RSA keys is beyond the scope of this writing and sadly something we had not the time to investigate.
Which brings us to the most bitter part of this entire discussion : the server hosting phuctor suddenly became inaccessible yesterday. It returned, apparently untouched, after the DC rebooted it. While this may be simple coincidence, we have at the present time no way to ascertain whether it is or it is not. Consequently, the originally intended, civilised process of emailing the victim, keeping things quiet for a while to give them time to update and so on is not practicable : for all we know others unknown are at the current time in possession of the same information we have. On the balance of these considerations, it is my decision that all this must be published immediately, with apologies to everyone on the receiving end. 
Nevertheless : emergency testing of all deployed RSA key generators must be undertaken now, to verify why exactly they would produce weak keys. Of special interest is, of course, the mechanism employed by Mr. Anvin himself, but one should not limit himself to that alone.
Let the scramble begin!
Update : Another pair was found. This also has one member in the strong set, but its owner is, apparently, luckier.

OKCoin do it as well as Bitfinex... most of the ones with margin trading probably do.
No special method, you just deposit then transfer your funds from the exchange account to the lending/investment account using their system.

Mixers are a way of masking source and destination, with a bit of hard work it can be possible to find the next destination after that tx but I've never tried. It also depends where it has been sent to, it could be somewhere anonymous so even if you pinpoint the destination it doesn't mean you'll get an ID.

A bunch of techies will give you some detailed answers. I'll try to provide a short/simple one that doesn't obsess over security and decentralisation etc. Since you're not even planning to store the funds.
1) Visit localbitcoins.com and choose someone with excellent feedback ratings. (Yes, this is a bank transfer not debit card, but if you've got a debit card then chances are you have online banking which is the preferred way to purchase bitcoin).
2) Once completed your bitcoin will be in your localbitcoins.com wallet instantly. Ask the merchant to provide their bitcoin address or copy and paste it from their checkout page. Send the desired amount straight from your localbitcoins.com wallet.
NB: You didn't specify your country, LBC serves every country hence I chose that for my example, you'll also find the traders on there are genuinely nice people so will walk you through it.

When you pay in-store with BTC they have to "go and get the bitcoin guy", it's not integrated into their tills (yet). Didn't realise they let you sell for bitcoin now too.
I tried to get them to stock satoBit vouchers, that way they could pay out in any multiple of £10 and £25 without having any technical skills (or Internet access). Plus, you as the customer, aren't limited to the rate at the time of purchase which as we all know can change dramatically between setting off to the shops and getting home from the shops!
Next time you're in there.. tell them there's a bitcoin voucher service called satoBit that would enable them to buy items for BTC and also sell BTC (head office are well aware of it!).
Disclaimer:  I am the own of satoBit and will give a sizeable tip to anyone who convinces them it's a good idea ;-)

Problem is when buying from an exchange (where the lower prices are) you have to already have the GBP on the exchange, else there's a long wait - by which time the price might've moved. Cash and localbitcoins.com are really the only instant way. Lowest price for bank transfer payment on LBC right now is £198.

Some of the major exchanges allow you to deposit funds which are then used to fund margin traders, and you get a percentage of the profits (from margin fees). Pretty risk-free if you trust the exchange - but the returns are conservative.

You can work it out roughly in your head, just lookup your addresses on blockchain.info to see how old they are, then times the days old by number of coins. Will be difficult if they are well used addresses but as a long term holder I'd hope you know to not reuse addresses too much.

It's part of the design, deflationary...  i.e. as it is used/spread more it's value increases..  this is where people get amusing potential future price guesses from - if it becomes really mainstream then mathematics tells you that 1 BTC will be worth a whole lot more than $300.

I've used ZipZap 4 times now, it's a bit of a ballache printing off the receipt thing, I know you can show it on your smartphone but the shopkeepers are going to struggle with that.
Purchase 1)  Shopkeeper refused to process it.
Purchase 2)  Confused shopkeeper managed to serve me.
Purchase 3)  Same shopkeeper as  she told me "this is annoying" with a face to match.
Purchase 4)  "I haven't got a PayZone machine" (I could clearly see he had).
Overall, it's a good price, especially for cash. But it's a pain in the arse, 2 of my 4 purchases have ended up unsuccessful and the 2 successful ones were at the shop that told me it's annoying so I don't know how many more she'll do before telling me to sod off. The problem is, the shopkeeper makes ZERO from it, so they have no interest in dealing with it.
Edit: I'd better add a disclaimer as I have launched a similar service recently.. the above info is not biased though, that's how it happened. If you're in the South Birmingham area you'll find a similar cash-to-bitcoin service listed on localbitcoins.com as an ATM.. no orders/ID/printouts required.. just go into the shop, ask for bitcoin, it comes in £10 and £25 glossy vouchers.

I was also going to say that but figured someone would nitpick that the source and destination addresses of a transaction made by passing a printed private key or whatever method might reveal some trail unlike cash. Though it depends where the cash was obtained and how it is spent.

Re-submit the same tx with a higher fee. It'll confirm before the lower fee one thus invalidating the lower fee one. You wouldn't want to do it through a website though because it'll need your private key to work. It's a command line job and I've never tried it so I'm not the one to explain how to do it :)

I did, I think I've just misjudged the point to it - I assumed it was for security (i.e. relating to the recent Bitstamp hack) Now I realise your point is for proof of reserves mainly rather than security, since what you describe is a hot wallet for trading funds, which if course is what already happens minus the proof of reserves parts.

With the rates fluctuating so much you can't be certain. The smoothest way to do it is to own some bitcoin and spend bits of it when you need to, rather than buying it to spend it.
A rule of thumb, if buying peer to peer such as localbitcoins would be buy an extra 7-10%.. you'll have a little bit left after you've made each purchase so after a few purchases you can buy 5% less than you need and use all that change you collected to make up the full amount.

Not taking a dig at you, but read up on leverage/margin trading. In the case of all BTC exchanges that offer it, that I know of, you can only ever lose up to the amount deposited. If you starting losing on the trade(s) big time then you get a margin call and eventually forced liquidation - before you're anywhere near losing all 20x.
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:24:51
I think Litecoin is a little more user-friendly to trade with.. it's much nicer having a whole 10 coins rather than 0.006 coins when you're just starting out. Plus the faster transaction times means you can "mess about" with them. The wallet choice is less than that of BTC but if you're just speculating/trading with it you don't really need a wallet.
Good luck, have fun. I bought LTC for the same reasons you are, I sold at the peak in Dec '13.. my speculatively fun punt worked out quite nicely (much nicer than BTC did). I re-bought during 2014 and still have them now.

You can run a node on any port so ISP port blocking would be disruptive but not catastrophic - plus nodes run all around the world so all ISPs would have to block.
Nodes know about each other from keeping their own log of nodes they know to exist, from getting list of nodes from other nodes and from DNS seeds which crawl the network and report nodes. The DNS seeds are centralised (though still distributed somewhat), the other methods are totally decentralised.

According to a blockchain.info tag on some of the source funds in that large transfer it's RipDice. Whether that tag is correct or not who knows unless a company publicly proves it's their funds.
i.e. I don't know. 
Given the timing and the fact that a lot have ended up here  yet a bunch are still here  it seems like a hot and cold wallet and given the size of the funds it looks like an exchange to me.

True, holding is better than nothing.

Bitcoin-QT can't spend from multi-sig at present, the only way to do that is by importing all the private keys (which effectively you have done by generating them with Bitcoin-QT).. but.. this negates the purpose of multi-sig.
You might be better off using something like Greenaddress, Coinkite, Copay, or one of the other multi-sig tools.

1Tb of disk and 20x current bandwidth is still pretty small even today. When/if 20Mb blocks are rolled out it doesn't mean blocks will actually be 20mb, they'll still be 0.6 Mb or whatever the average is right now. Trolls, sheep and over-thinking engineers have spawned this mass war over the block chain size.
Sure, one day the blockchain is gonna get pretty big, but code changes are in the works, regular users have no need to run a "full" node, bandwidth is really low if you limit to 10-20 connections even if you do run a full node. Bitcoin businesses and miners will always be happy to dedicate some resources to nodes. It's all good.

You'd be a brave person to keep 1500 BTC in an address you carry around in your pocket to buy snacks with!
Split your funds across multiple addresses, and if you have a large holding then keep them in a cold address and just move chunks out to top-up your "hot wallet" as needed. (NB: and place the remaining funds into a new cold address).
If you want to mask from the casual observer then after you've taken a chunk out of cold, run it through CoinJoin before it gets to your hot wallet.

I guess the point is that all these VPS nodes are going to be sharing datacentres.. 50 nodes in the same datacentre isn't much different in terms of helping Bitcoin than your one node at home. 
For the tin foil hat opinion, these datacentres can all also be coerced by governments.
In my opinion, since you already run a node at home, unless you're using that VPS server or node for something else too then I don't think it's worth paying $8/mo or whatever you pay for a VPS datacentre node just to "support the Bitcoin network".

I'm not familiar with the code, just some of the comings and goings. I can see from other comments in this topic that the SPV headers-only for Namecoin doesn't seem to include any kind of NMC specific data and can't be used to lookup domains/ID's. Which is a shame. It could be added of course but then it would make iterative updates based on the Bitcoin codebase more difficult I suspect. Irony I suppose, the service and tools are decentralised but the actual sourcecode is centralised (to bitcoin).

The eco system is growing, can't deny that. The number of coins out there is growing, can't deny that either. Bitcoin gained a lot of users at the end of 2013, and lost a lot during 2014, we probably gained more than we lost. Even those that we lost, they still are now aware of bitcoin and to some extent how it works - they're adopters in stasis.

Totally agree..  there are already bound to be 100's of nodes on AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc. another 100 isn't really going to help anything other than providing some upload bandwidth/peers for new nodes.
Still, I'm sure it's all with good intentions but as you say - I'd rather than ran a dozen nodes on hardware they own than 100 on AWS.

Sites use different exchange rates, often when paying for something in bitcoin the rate is slightly lower than the market rate and often when buying (especially p2p like localbitcoins) the rate is slightly above the market rate.
So that spread of a couple of % is why you have slightly too little bitcoin to make your purchase.

You kinda described Bitcoin in your title.. I expected some text to go with it. 
The whole idea is that lots of people mine, for whatever reason, whatever size. Lots of people will always mine, the financial incentive ensures that. Even when the block reward is gone in a century or so there will still be incentive to mine if Bitcoin is still a thing.

There are some other options and there will be many more in the future I imagine. That is the open source way. However, ensure that you know what you are using when yours and other peoples money is at stake.
I'm not claiming that bitcoincore is superior to other forks/implementations but you should at least research who the developers are, how often it is updated (e.g. security patches) and what the differences are with the current "standard" network of bitcoincore.

The network port needs to be open so that other peers can connect to you, without it being open you can only connect to other peers who have their port open - that's why running a full node with the port open is important.
Your port not being open won't affect your usage of the node, but you won't be helping any other nodes unless you happen to connect to a node that isn't sync'd then your node would provide some block data to them.
The only way I can think without opening the port would be to use SSH tunnelling to a computer/server that does have the port open and use -externalip to define that. But to be honest, that isn't simple for a non-techie to set-up and won't be 100% reliable.

Yes Ledgers are very easy to use and well priced. I like to use it with Mycellium using an OTG adapter but the Chrome app is fine too.
For the ledger backup all you need is your initial seed (provided when you first setup the Ledger) and your code card (which has a QR that you can backup). Keep both of those safe and even if you lose your wallet you can restore your coins.

Do you want to understand how the protocol works (mining, blocks, nodes, etc.) or do you want to understand how to use it as a currency?
A good way to start is to buy a small amount from wherever is easiest for you (probably localbitcoins.com).. send it to a blockchain.info wallet.. then play around with some transactions - maybe make a charitable donation, place a dice bet, or simply send some to another wallet. You'll then get used to things like confirmation times, fees, change addresses, multiple inputs and/or outputs, etc.

If I sent some coin to that market and then followed their route they'd probably end up in a hot wallet with other users of that market. There may be cold storage addresses used too by the market. So you can quite easily tie some addresses together, especially if you repeat this process a few times.
Even if all deposited coins are not merged into common addresses they will likely still be in the same wallet somewhere. When a payout is made to a user it's likely that the payout will consist of multiple unspent outputs from different addresses - thus linking them.

Mint does share things with Ubuntu but AFAIK Mint is not commercial and it certainly doesn't come by default with the frankly useless Amazon integration. I would outright recommend Debian and not some Debian-based distro, but OP is new to Linux and I don't want to recommend something that looks a bit 1990's even if it's the best and most stable option. Linux Mint MATE or one of the other lighterweight window manager options is definitely the way to go if you don't want to go head first into Linux straight from Windoze.
My issue with Ubuntu is not just it's clear commercial angle, it's the fact that it is unstable, irritating, constantly updating, prompting for reboots, crashing, sluggish, etc... it's f awful as an OS compared to any other Linux distro I've used even 10 years ago. And man, why oh  why have they implemented focus-stealing code in it.. for the love of god! The first thing you notice when moving from doze to nix is that your focus isn't constantly stolen from some app or popup and that you can scrollwheel without actually clicking-to-focus first, simple stuff like that which makes Linux a pleasure to use for day-to-day working compared with Windoze. The whole ethos and angle that Canonical took with Ubuntu was wrong from day one. I barely even consider it Linux and the only reason I have one instance of Ubuntu is because it was the easiest OS to set-up for one particular driver I require. &lt;/ubuntu-rant&gt;

The number of users does not affect the need for more nodes, as more users (and businesses) come in to Bitcoin there will be more nodes.
Restricting the block size to make a node slightly less resource hungry is a stupid idea. It'll cause problems, piss users off and will likely end up not increasing the node count. It's a short-sighted knee-jerk reaction.
More decentralisation/nodes will come from more users.. confusing or higher tx fees will deter users not entice. Bitcoin should be reliable, cheap, fast and not complicated.. it mostly is and is improving all the time.. let's stick to that and not argue over money/fees/electricity.

First bits is just the first person to use the first few chars of a bitcoin address. It's really only of any use with vanity addresses. If you were the first ever person to use an address starting with 1bintytinty (case insensitive) then you could list your address as simply 1bintytinty without the rest of it because a full node can lookup the first ever address used with that prefix.
Things don't work like that any more, not everyone has the full blockchain and people know not to reuse addresses.. so there's not much point having a vanity firstbits address. I still own a few though, it was good fun at the time.
@_date: 2015-08-02 01:10:30
That hostname is a DNS seed. It uses the nodes on the network to create a database of known nodes and active nodes - when a node comes online it can poll that hostname using standard DNS systems to gain a randomised list of some active nodes to connect to. I believe IRC was/is used in a similar fashion too where the new node would connect to a specific chat room and be provided with a list of node IP address to get it going.
A "botnet" is very different to peer-to-peer, I don't think bitcoin nodes look like a botnet when you look at the connections etc. - it looks like a p2p node.

There are many other brick n' mortar merchants, independent shops dotted around the country.
You're right though, the rates we pay here for bitcoin are higher than most countries because of our banks limiting exchanges. So it probably is cheaper to pay with GBP on most occasions - unless you already own the BTC and had bought it at a lower rate than the current rate.
takeaway.com is a good example for bitcoin being better - it's a much smoother checkout with BTC when compared to cash, paypal and cards. Once they've added it to their app you can also pay in-store for your takeaway food.

Others have answered before I logged back in so you have the gist. Essentially if you have a full node, with the full blockchain, you need not trust any single 3rd party whatsoever. 
A web wallet obviously has serious security issues and always will, they are useful and good, but they are a convenience product.
A desktop wallet can either be light, core or full. 
* Light is better than a web wallet - you hold your keys - but you still have to trust the data your wallet provides you because your computer cannot verify it itself. 
* Core is a good medium, you have the blockchain data, your computer need not trust any single party. But it does need to trust the 8 peers it is connected to, if they were all owned by a colluding malicious entity then your wallet could be tricked into thinking something false.
* Full is the ultimate protection. You have the full data, can fully verify everything locally and you will be connected to far more than 8 other peers giving you much more protection from sybil/node attacks.
A full node doesn't give you any features you can't find elsewhere, but it does give you them all under one roof in a fully verifiable way, not important to most, but it is an important and very unique feature of Bitcoin/digital currencies.

It's obvious isn't it?.. For people that like to dabble in altcoins.. not traders, who are used to exchanges and trade long term so confirm times are no bother.. but people who just like to have a fun gamble.
I don't know what their volume per coin is but I suspect LTC is in the top spot. (edit: below BTC of course)
The fees are higher than exchanges but not so much so that it bothers users I suspect, because it is very convenient.

Most people who use bitcoin regularly probably already have at least one verified exchange account, so that's half the work done. If when you moved to Japan you pre-empted this then you'd probably have set-up a local exchange account there when you did all your other paperwork so again, fairly normal. Obviously doing it all at once would be a pain and probably always will be - the financial system as it is.
The fiat transfer delays shouldn't exist in my opinion, this is just banks making money from our money, or simply being outright inefficient and is annoying.
A faster and easier but fairly equivalent option would have been to use something like localbitcoins.com but it depends on how comfortable you are with that type of experience. You'd have got it done in an hour easily.
In the future a bitcoin exchange account linked to your bank + ID will be a standard addition to the various other accounts everyone owns. The future is bright :)

Cool. I've placed probably 50+ orders with takeaway.com this year - 90% bitcoin. I've had several issues with PayPal and only 2 with bitcoin and all I had to do was refresh the BitPay page and takeaway.com noticed the transaction. I would say it's a BitPay or implementation bug - if the user's browser doesn't redirect properly for whatever reason they don't get the payment confirmation so your order doesn't go through to them fully. Copy and paste the BitPay URL before you pay just in case - then you can reload the page if it messes up.

It is when you spend from an address that it becomes ever-so-slightly vulnerable, so if you're just loading up an address for storage you're fine.
If your concern is privacy you're doing it wrong. Because of course the sender (and anybody else) can see what you did with the received funds.
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:25:47
You could always export your keys and import elsewhere to send to a new wallet. (always a good idea to still send the funds to a new address for security when changing wallets).

* 1)  It decentralises the data, the relay/p2p and the transactions. Mining is different. It also opens up Tor/I2P/MeshNet/Etc options.
* 2)  Not all SPV/ligth wallets use their own servers, bitcoincore provides header data in a decntralised maner.
* 3)  A miner could potentially mine something off-consensus.. but nodes would reject it. Network protection.
* 4)  Maybe. You're not wrong. But more nodes does make it harder for people to take control of the p2p side by requiring them to need more nodes to achieve that. Same with monitoring, harder to detect which node pushed the tx which may help trace *who* pushed the tx.
* 5)  *Be your own bank*. I don't think I need to explain this one.
* 6)  No most people don't need fingertip access to the data, some people want it (i.e. security) and some use it for business. The OP asked for advantages, this is an advantage - no 3rd party Internet-based API required.
 
 
For the average Joe.. they don't **need** the blockchain on their computer. But the fact that you **can** have it on your computer and *trust nobody* is important. That I believe was one of Satoshi's main visions that a lot of us share today.

The reason I spent 2yrs thinking about it and then finally getting an idea good enough to actually do is two-fold.. 
Firstly, I believe in Bitcoin and I want to make it easier for newcomers and less Internet-savvy based users.
Secondly, you have to admit there are parallels with TCP/IP, WWW and email.. to me it seems like a sensible gamble to think that Bitcoin will become very mainstream - even if in disguise - in the next 10-15yrs. That doesn't mean the price will "moon" - that's not my thought process - adoption is.

If it counts when Neteller allowed you to deposit bitcoin and use their plastic card with the funds I had a lavish meal with the Mrs at a nice hotel all funded with BTC.

Unfortunately your 2FA was email and so was your support conversation, so because your email was compromised and your login details went through your email it meant your hacker had access to both of the two factors.
It's unfortunate and blockchain.info should probably have a separate authentication system for support where you can enter your ID and password to produce a unique code which you could give to them to prove your ownership, rather than asking for your password. But the real problem was that your email was compromised, without that you wouldn't have lost any funds. I hope you've changed your email password and thought about how someone got into that.
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:12:30
No not really. It's quite simple to set-up, the node will function fully on both Tor and clear net, Tor manages itself in the background and doesn't use any noticeable resources.
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:43:47
You could host the node on Tor, that just requires being connected to Tor, defining the hidden service in tor config and booting the nodes with the onion arg to make your onion known.
The benefit being Tor users can stay within Tor to reach your node(s) and don't need to go through an exit node.

Easiest option is to wait for the package repository to be updated.
Other options include un-installing the repository version you have now and using the binaries that you've extracted from your tar command above. Or, download the source and compile it.

It's not a problem it's a caveat. It is easily overcome and increasingly so with all the new work being done on wallets and other software. Printing 2-3 copies of a paper wallet still works just fine though.

I would say that you would still treat full node storage mostly like a web wallet. You wouldn't just leave half your net worth on there, you'd keep that cold or h/ware protected. But you can keep a much larger amount on a full node more confidently than any web wallet or exchange (assuming you're not hosting that node on a public/family computer --&gt; **or a VPS** &lt;-- ).
I consider a true full node to be a bitcoincore wallet running (likely headless) on Linux computer that is not used for desktop purposes and is physically owned by the wallet owner.
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:34:15

Thanks for confirming Litecoin is safe. 
Namecoin is now also kept up to date with Bitcoin code, however, many of the nodes on the network still use the "stable" branch which is the very old stagnant version - the up-to-date version still requires compiling from source.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:45:37
Spammers... I mean, Stress Testers... are spamming... I mean, testing... the network. It's only just started reaching enough of a back log to make any effect and I guess these exchange fee estimates aren't triggering higher fees yet or weren't when you made this transaction. Just a bit of bad luck I think.
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:55:05
Maybe it's running the DNS Seed software, which crawls the Bitcoin network to catalogue available nodes to provide to wallets when they boot up. They may have modified the software to also update their own database for whatever reason.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:38:48
Pruned nodes and SPV/light nodes are similar to this. The full bitcoincore however should be just that, full - *be your own bank* and all that. By having the full chain the node can be 100% certain of the current state of every input and output, there's no other way to be 100% certain.
Plus, it's not really that much of an issue - it's not that much data. If your device can't handle the data then there are plenty of options.

@_date: 2015-07-01 19:52:27
Seems fairly reasonable to me, the higher one has been up slightly longer and will have seen more transactions. The way Linux uses RAM and buffers will account for some differences too.
Someone with more detailed knowledge of how bitcoind uses RAM may have a better answer but when the difference is only about 10% I'd just put it down to one node being better connected than the other.
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:58:06

There may not be executable windows builds of old versions. If I were you I'd have my new wallet set-up and then import the broken wallet.dat into blockchain.info and send everything straight to the new wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:18:08
Open the debug console in bitcoincore and type 'dumpprivkey 1bitcoinaddresshere' and repeat for each that you need to migrate. For each one it will give you a private key which you can import into most other wallets.
However, as others have said - addresses should only be used once where possible so unless there's a reason to keep the specific addresses you're better off starting a new wallet and sending all your coins there using a normal transaction.
It should also be noted that a lot of "light" wallets use HD addresses which are derived from a single master key, this can make it confusing to manage your own keys when some are HD and some are not. Not impossible or even difficult, but you should understand the difference between HD and not.
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:00:23
No not really. Several have web interfaces too so need for the device if it is lost, the others have a simple backup seed/file which you can import into the replacement device.
Plus, if they want fiat then chances are they'll regularly send the wallet contents to an exchange meaning there won't be much on the device anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:07:45

It looks like some kind of blockchain storage system, if you look on a block explorer that decodes the data (and actually works at a reasonable speed unlike blockr.io) then you will see usernames in the transactions. There are also other similar transactions that don't involve the 11111111 address if you look at some address history.
Judging by the contents of the recent transactions it looks like someone is developing something. Maybe some kind of Namecoin-esque user ID record? Or some kind of P2P system that uses the blockchain to store users.
Edit:  [mini-rant]
I think this sort of thing is going to become a problem, block size increase or not. I understand that the blockchain is an awesome tool that will be used by many, many services in the future. But I don't see why it has to be the Bitcoin blockchain for everything. Why not use use Namecoin (and now Ethereum too perhaps) which is designed for data/record storage and has ample network security even now in its lowest ebb since conception. Every man and his dog can use Bitcoin for whatever they like but it's a lot cheaper, less disruptive/wasteful and more sensible to use a tool that fits better - it's the exact same tech.

You could try installing an older version of bitcoin core, it doesn't need to be sync'd for you to output your private keys and sweep into a new wallet. You may have to compile manually on Linux though as I don't think old binaries are available, only source.

You could use remote-X..  just SSH into your ubuntu server with the -X parameter, then when you run bitcoin-qt in the remote terminal it opens on your local screen, but still from the remote server.

I would recommend using it for absolutely anything, even just sending to yourself across different wallets. That's a great way to quickly become comfortable with how bitcoin works. It'll also help defend you from falling victim to scammers by not being a newbie.
For a bit of fun with it you could; Try out trading (e.g. bitfinex.com), try gambling or donate to charity - if any of those float your boat.
Investing it is an option but be careful. BTC Jam is legit (though not entirely free of fraudsters I don't think). Another less interesting option is to provide your BTC for traders to use when "margin trading"..  you'll earn a small percentage interest on your balance regularly.. a few of the well known trading sites have this service.

If you don't want/need to keep all the history the latest version of bitcoincore (0.11) can be configured to prune the blockchain to a size of your choosing (with around 500Mb being the suggested minimum).
Edit:  Caveat, this initial pruning implementation does not support wallet features (nor block relay) due to a couple of technical items such as importing addresses (how would it scan the find the transactions for that new address). These technical items are being addressed and wallet functionality will be compatible soon with pruned nodes.

The time that 1 BTC has been sitting idle for 1 day.
When you make a transaction the days destroyed can be worked out by looking at the inputs, proportionally to the 1 BTC per 1 day formula.
If for example you were to send exactly 1 BTC from a single 10 BTC input that was exactly 1 day old (i.e. you received the input 1 day ago) then the days destroyed would be 10, because 10 BTC have moved (1 BTC to your destination and 9 BTC to a change address).
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:45:43
Yes host a full node (preferably not on a VPS in a big data centre where there will already be nodes) and use bitcoin for day-to-day things (not just moving funds around pointlessly).
Mining on a smaller but trusted pool (e.g. BitMinter) is also a good thing, or better still - solo - if you can muster enough hashrate.
I guess the only other way to help is to scrutinise the code of bitcoincore and/or test for inefficiencies and issues.

You're in luck. It's confirmed :)  Ordinarily that transaction would have only taken a few hours, just bad luck with this silly stress test going on.
You can never lose your money by including an insufficient fee - even a zero fee tx will likely confirm eventually, failing that the tx will be dropped after about 72hrs and the funds will return to your original address as if you'd never made a transaction.

All bitcoin addresses are equal, no address is easier to "crack" than any other. With the exception of things like brain wallets where the user chooses a word/phrase as a base for what is supposed to be the random part of generating an address.
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:31:09
Yes HD can have loads of addresses all from one master key - so you just backup the key once and then all future addresses are included in that backup without having to keep recreating the backup.
If it's just one address you could use one of the mobile, web or light wallets for just that address and use another wallet for the rest of your bitcoin. Alternatively, keep your own backup of that one private key and then it doesn't matter how the wallet you choose handles non-HD addresses.

Yes and it will give you a long key that looks like a bitcoin address but starts with a 5. Print that off and keep it safe, it's all you need to access any funds in that address in an emergency. You could save it on a USB drive or whatever but thinking of security printing it off and never storing it on your computer makes sense - just copy it straight into Notepad or whatever and print without saving the document.
You'll have to look at the help files for whichever wallet you choose to switch to, for details on how to import that key so that you can use the address with your new wallet.
PS: You will need to temporarily decrypt your wallet to export that private key - there's probably an option for it in the menu but if not just type 'walletpassphrase passwordhere 300' in the debug console and then you'll be unlocked for 5 minutes.

When you are mining [on a pool] you are sharing the workload with a heap of other miners - that's your shares. A share is worth nothing unless the pool you are with finds a block based on your shares and other user's shares.. then you'll get a proportional payout of bitcoin based on how much of the workload for that block you shared. Something like that anyway.
But, as everyone else will tell you - mining isn't efficient, especially if you're talking GPU mining. You'll earn hardly any bitcoin at all. 
Buy a small amount of bitcoin, spend some, buy more, spend some.. try out some different wallets.. read some info on websites.. that's what I'd recommend.

There are some sites (wallet explorer is one I think) that try to match addresses into "wallets" rather than just being individual address. It's also usually fairly obvious when you follow coins and they hit an exchange from the sheer number of coins and transactions done by the address they end up in. It's no exact science but definitely not impossible to deduce if the coins have ended up at an exchange and which exchange.

It's 3am over here now so I'll probably blurt out crap here but hey, I'm enjoying the discussion - you make valid points unlike the majority of "bitcoin, wtf, load of crap" types. You actually understand and use your brain!
The benefit for me of being my own bank - I do have bank accounts too btw :) - is that I 100% control it and it helps me budget. If I move money around my bank accounts for budgeting and savings etc it soon makes a mess, makes financial applications difficult (when they go through your banking history) and when mixed in with all the automated debits and card transactions etc. it's just hard to follow. I didn't just dive in to bitcoin as soon as I learned of it (man, I wish I had!!).. it took time for me to realise that it was actually a really valuable tool not just for the obvious reasons of being a global decentralised currency etc. but for budgeting and money control. As others have said, it really does encourage and facilitate saving more than you would normally - even with the volatility. When I receive income I reserve some in my bank account for automated debits and card purchases but most goes straight into bitcoin and I control it from there, if I need some back in my bank account it's not time-consuming to do, in fact - with all the security involved with online banking nowadays bitcoin is a bucket load easier to quickly make a payment. For example when I order a takeaway, I can either call up and pay with cash - no thanks, or I can pay online and either store my card details online - no thanks or type them in every time - no thanks. With bitcoin and takeaway.com I just pick my food, click pay, scan QR, done. 
Fees. I'm not convinced either that Bitcoin saves money on fees. It does for me but that's a long story that I won't get into. But for your average user you're right, the fees are still there, though international transactions definitely save money - currency conversion rates with banks are diabolical. Also, because I actively trade a little bit I do tend to buy my bitcoin at lower rates than I spend it at which takes care of any fees levied by merchants/BitPay, I can't do that with a bank. Not easily and instantly anyway and not with small amounts either. I don't know if it is the same where you are based but often card transactions involve fees too - airlines a prime example where their fees for using a credit card far outweigh any BitPay/merchant fees.
Bank services.. yes my bank provides services Bitcoin can't and I appreciate them.. such as an overdraft, insurance, extras such as breakdown cover and travel/gadget insurance.. I pay my monthly fee for that happily and get my money's worth. 
Finally, and this one kinda explains my pro-bitcoin stance if my recent comments above don't. I hate banks. Last year my life and my business were near-ruined for a month by my main bank. All of my accounts, business and personal, were frozen - totally unrelated to bitcoin or any wrongdoing I should add. I had no access to ATMs, cards, online banking, telephone banking, even branch banking. I couldn't send or receive money, automated or manually. I effectively had no bank account for a month. It seriously hurt me, my family and my business and a whole heap of shit has happened since that event, because of that event, that I'm still suffering right now. For instance, all of my automated debits were rejected - so all of my insurance, phones, etc were cancelled.. Put somewhat dramatically I was suddenly left with no car (because no insurance), no income, no pet/mobile/home/etc insurance, no access to money whatsoever.. I couldn't pay my mortgage, utility bills, tax, I couldn't even buy food. The bank didn't care. I cannot go through that again, ever. And no, I can't just switch banks - because all of that absolutely destroyed my credit rating so I now get refused until that has passed. The nail in the coffin.. after taking my bank to the financial ombudsman, and winning, I was paid peanuts in compensation and the transaction that sparked the whole thing was just a regular payment from a business client that was in no way fraudulent and if they'd simply asked the sender's bank to verify it would have been confirmed. You can now see why I'd rather be my own bank even without all the previous reasons! Unfortunately, my story isn't all that uncommon, in the UK at least.

IF she's just locking it away then it's hard to go wrong with a paper wallet (and you could keep an encrypted digital copy too perhaps). Or if she might spend some in the future but would ask you how to first then it's still a good simple plan.
IF there's a chance she'll get curious and spend some then you're better off with something that handles change addresses like HD wallets as suggested by others here.
When trying to introduce non-techies to Bitcoin it's best to not force them into things they are scared of, many moms are scared of smartphones / can't use them.. never mind using Google Play and apps..  I don't know many non-techie people over 40 who even know what Play Store is despite owning Android phones. This just makes Bitcoin alien nonsense to them. A paper wallet with a "password" on it is a lot more clear to understand and if they get curious, then you can start explaining and showing them things.
If there's a bit of suspense there it'll build curiosity and promote questions, if it's daunting the walls will come up and you'll end up sounding like a preacher of alien technology :)

Bitcoin is programmable money, it can be done in a bunch of ways. ChangeTip is easily automated, I'd suggest that because if the user doesn't want the bitcoin at least you haven't lost it and you don't need to acquire an address.

Yes, fair enough. If you need that kind of anonymity then you do have to understand how it works else you'll make mistakes. But to continue the pedantic theme - if one were to steal cash from a cash transit vehicle then those serial numbers would be tagged just as a bitcoin tx chain could be... still doesn't prove that myself, friend A or friend B are the bad guy even if it were entirely cash not bitcoin.

I see you confirmed the concerns of some people that because blockchain.info is so prominent and because its name is "blockchain" that you assume it is integral or somehow responsible for Bitcoin.

Not attacking you, it's an honest mistake.. just thought I'd clear it up for you.

The blockchain is the Bitcoin ledger, distributed via peer-to-peer with no central server, verified by Bitcoin nodes and generated by miners. Essentially it is Bitcoin.

True, 1k BTC is a nice sum. I'd still worry about theft though when I wasn't at home. Setting up an RPi is as simple as burning a Debian-based image to a flash drive btw, though you'd have to consider the reliability of a flash drive.

I mostly trade through APIs so that I don't have to mess about logging in etc. Didn't take me long to knock up some API code and my own basic trading interface that is the same for various exchanges.
You mention lag, okcoin.cn (the site and API) is often laggy for me (am based in the UK but it's probably China slowing things down). Frustrating when you just want to check open orders or trade history.
Security, as in the process of logging in, is pretty much standard across the board on the major exchanges. Security, as in anti-theft, varies.. I've had a phone call in the middle of the night before from a nice Chinese guy checking authorisation for a BTC withdrawal.

I guess you missed the uproar when a company launched hundreds of nodes to try to gleam information they couldn't do without controlling a good percentage of nodes. Increase the number of nodes increases the cost / viability of an attack like that. Also some other smaller factors such as load-balancing for SPV data and for example more geographic locations in the case of some kind of widespread Internet issue - let's say an island somewhere lost it's under-sea connection to the outside world... people would struggle.. more nodes on that island means better chance that someone has a sat connection thus providing blockchain access to the island. Far fetched but more nodes is definitely better than fewer nodes even if in normal situations bitcoin would function just fine with only a handful of nodes.

It's not almost zero, but by doubling it prevents simple hash/rainbow/whatever attacks if it starts becoming mapped.

SD cards aren't known for their reliability - so don't make it your only backup. Also consider encrypting the SD card.
To store a bitcoin address all you need is the private key which can be exported from most wallet software or better still generated offline with something like bitaddress, bitcoincore or even vanitygen.
Other common methods for storing keys are paper wallets (literally just print the key onto a piece of paper) or hardware wallets such as Ledger and Trezor.

Does it? If you load £100 onto PayPal it becomes "PayPal Bux" which when you spend it is sent to the merchant's account.. still as "PayPal Bux" - there's no bank or fiat transfer involved there. When a merchant withdraws to fiat then their "PayPal Bux" are converted to their choice of fiat minus the fee for using "PayPal Bux". Other than the fact that bitcoin has it's own independent value unlike "PayPal Bux" it seems pretty much the same to me /in this context/.

Yes, you can send and receive as much as you like with just a single address. Other people will be able to see how much you've received though and you won't necessarily be able to tell who sent it to you.

I can't claim to know the exact mathematical process of mining, but I am familiar with how it works. I understand your point, but for the same reason that we can get blocks with far fewer tx included than are valid and waiting in the mempool we should always be able to find a block. A block is just the first solution of many solutions to the current "problem", which solution is adopted by enough nodes to make it a confirmed block is down to whichever gets enough validations (node acceptance) first. Unless I'm missing something on the mathematical/cryptography side that should mean that even if some kind of issue like you're proposing occurs, blocks will still be found, perhaps slower than they should be but not a grinding halt situation.
If your concern is right and miners end up fruitlessly searching for a solution to a problem that can't be solved within the defined parameters, the developers would be on it like a shot - maybe drastically with a forced hard fork or whatever, or maybe the incentive to upgrade your node because of the issue would be enough to get enough nodes to update for the new consensus to start accepting blocks that the previous version wouldn't.

It's a shame Cloudflare is based in the US - I don't see why they need to be, while the US's reach is far - actually being incorporated and running from the US does make your theory more likely. 
The problem is, Cloudflare provides really easy and instant security and DDoS protection plus other benefits such as geographical location and b/w optimisation (auto-minification). I think larger services, with high resources, really should start doing it properly rather than relying on Cloudflare. For the startups and little guys - it's somewhat of a necessary evil.

Yes but you'd be better using Linux if you're familiar enough with it to setup basic tools.
NAS just means a storage drive on a network, you could use one of your spare machines as a host for the drive(s) or a dedicated NAS hardware device which come with built-in Windows/Linux/Mac file sharing services. Attach all the machines, and the NAS machine/device on the same network switch as it'll use a lot of LAN traffic if you have 100s of nodes. You just need to mount (or "map" in windoze) the network drive on each machine that hosts a node and give each node it's own subfolder to store the block chain data.
Edit:  The disk load will be fairly high if you're talking hundreds of nodes, so I would suggest using RAID to balance the load across physical disks and also as a form of redundancy should a drive fail.
Edit2:  There's also nothing stopping you hosting multiple nodes on each machine if they have the resources, just choose a different server port in the bitcoin.conf file so they don't conflict.

You'd have to ask bitnodes how their code handles it - or look yourself as I think it is open source. However, I'm pretty sure if you're connected to a node it won't allow you to connect to it twice at the same time so no matter whether bitnode's scanner goes in via ip4 or ip6 it will only get 1 connection. You can also sortof filter nodes by getting the list of connected peers and other vital stats - if they are identical then it's probably the same node.
I don't know if the bitnodes scanner does any of that or if it runs from multiple locations (quite possible) meaning it could connect to a node twice.
If there is no duplicate filtering then I suspect you are right and a bunch of the ip6's are also on ip4.
94 nodes in china is obviously wrong, but connecting to china is ropey from outside of china - it's probably just that very few western nodes bother connecting to chinese nodes due to latency/speed.. that might explain why it's showing so low.
Edit: There are also some Tor-only nodes which probably aren't on bitnodes.io

Use a good quality thumb drive to store all of your essential info, logins, seeds, keys, GPG, etc. Make sure it's an encrypted partition (use a Linux virtual machine if you have to). Then you can easily update the data on there each month or so and can include other documents not just your coin related stuff. Just make sure someone in the family knows the decryption key/password and that it's important that they access the contents in the event of your death. Mine has a information document on it explaining the importance just in case my wife dies at the same time as me!

Was Bitcoin insecure when it had 51% problems? Did any harm come of it or did it resolve itself fairly quickly without real drama?
My guess is nobody wanted to speak up about the hashrate imbalance because of Reddit-fever, I know that's why I didn't make a post. It was known the hashrate was out of equilibrium but that is a social issue rather than technical issue, miners can choose where to mine and if this pool were to attack the coin then the users aren't going to stay mining there.
Because Namecoin is merge-mined it will only take one more large Bitcoin pool to include it and 51% would likely not happen again.

UNIX clearly pre-dates Linux, I can't believe that anyone would think otherwise. That's the whole point of Linux, to move away from the rigid UNIX and make something more for the people. Apple did the same, they just did it their own way and in no way the same way as the Linux Kernel and Linux distros did.

Yes a Windows web server isn't ideal for security. Nor is Windows at all for that matter but that's a different topic!
You could install VirtualBox, install the latest Debian operating system on it (a default install is fine). Then add a bitcoin node and apache2 web server to it and run the whole lot in a virtual machine on your Windows PC. Then you'd have a lot less security to worry about so long as you just forward port 80 and 8333 to the virtual machine. 
I agree though, hosting the web page too does rule out non-techies - it'll even rule out some techies too because they might already be running a web server on that IP address meaning they can't host a page as required.
At least you're running a full node though - you might not be in the reward program by bitnodes but you're still helping Bitcoin :)

It's swings and roundabouts. By using dedicated accounts you are much more on the radar because your account won't be acting like a regular account and if you aren't paying a monthly fee or using the debit card then the bank isn't really making any money from you either, which they don't like.
Using a long-standing account your bitcoin transactions will be well under the radar if you don't abuse it. I actually told my bank that I trade bitcoin "a little". They didn't bat an eyelid. I'm not going to name them though because I don't want to recommend them.

I think what Luke is trying to say is that while you could store votes in Bitcoin transactions it would be a little impractical. Even a small-ish country like the UK would require 10's of millions of records all on the same day for an election. It would of course require a centralised service too, as 100% of the voting population is not going to know how to generate and record some kind of custom bitcoin transaction.
You could do it with decentralised tools and perhaps something like Blockstore which is an off-chain p2p database essentially.. but if you did, would it be of any benefit over existing voting?
I'm sure Luke will chime in with something else as he is very familiar with Bitcoin's technicalities.. I just thought I'd elaborate on "No." with some of the obvious ones.

The other guys have explained it well. I don't hate PoS but Bitcoin works well as it is and doesn't need changing.

You might want to hit Google or head over to or whatever OS you are using, if it's a Debian-based Linux then something like 'apt-get install apache2' will set most of it up for you, then forward port 80 on your router the same as you have the bitcoind port, and edit index.htm in /var/www/html to just contain your bitcoin address. You can test it by navigating to  and you should just see your address.

Regarding your question.. I would have said Jan/Feb 2016 as that was the plan and I figured it would be in motion by now - but that's looking unlikely so mid-2016 is my guess now, I don't think it can wait much longer to be resolved but it needs time to be set in motion.

I agree with btw, I saw the headline - got excited. Saw the actual detail, was still moderately interested. Saw the price - closed the page. 
You can use an old computer to run a proper full node, or whatever else that is cheaper than $400. Setting Linux up to compile and install bitcoincore is trivial if you're the type to compile from source already (else you'd just use a binary).
The mining chip is a neat trick and amusingly similar to the speed of a single KNC first batch module (which used 150+ watts). However, it will mine nothing but dust today.
The trading/merchant tools on it sound interesting and I will look more into them, for less experienced developers they could be quite useful tools when wrapped with all the other standard stuff included in the package. However, when it comes to running some payment processing software (i.e. mission critical) I wouldn't be doing that by relying on a RPi, or anything that ran off an SD card, or anything that had a miner attached.
Neat product, I'd buy one if I had that sort of money to play with, but I think I'd only recommend it to a small subset of people from what I know of the device and software today.

Hey Ryan, thanks for the info. I wasn't aware of the blockstore implementation, it does make more sense now!
I realise there is a hash distribution issue with NMC, it's an unfortunate by-product of it's stagnant development for so long due to the need to rebase it to the 0.10 bitcoincore. However, this is fully implemented now and 100% of miners are using the 0.10 codebase. A couple of new BTC pools recently started merge mining NMC too. Sure, 60% mining share is bad but the solution should be rectified by the re-emergence of development around NMC, something which you guys have done yourselves too. More use cases = more users = more miners = better distribution.
I know you've made your decisions now and won't be going back to NMC and that's a shame. Never mind. I wish you luck and I hope that this doesn't kill off the service, maybe I'll re-integrate it sometime in the future but for now it will just have to be disabled.

I see your point now, you'd have to be pretty inexperienced to receive a payment on an address that you have been given the private key for. That's like giving someone a PayPal login and saying "the funds are in there for you" rather than sending the funds to the persons actual PayPal account.

I guess it is hard to not pick a side and therefore have some bias, now you put it like that.
I do try to see past the negativeness on the most part, there's my pro-bitcoin bias playing it's part. But, I'd also be the first to admit that while Bitcoin is technically ready "for the masses" - it's not exactly a walk in the park for the masses and most would not want to use it right now nor feel comfortable with the responsibility of being their own bank - which incidentally is what I see as Bitcoin's main feature and the entire reason I got into Bitcoin. I also don't blindly jump up and down as positive news, you say "keep an open mind" and I couldn't agree more, I wish more people would in all aspects of life.
Many focus on the price, I do own some bitcoin but it's not an investment per say, I actually use it regularly to pay for things because I prefer to be my own bank and I regularly transact internationally. And no, those things aren't purchased via Tor, for those who are thinking that. I designed and created my own trading bots - but they don't aim to make money - their aim is to partly stabilise my fiat-equivalent balance, so actually I don't benefit much from price rises.

I seriously doubt it had anything to do with LBC, nobody who isn't a troll or overreacting adolescent thought LBC was doing an exit scam.
Edit:  This type of post is exactly why people think the Bitcoin community is "toxic". In particular on Reddit. There was absolutely NO BASIS for the rumour that LBC was performing an exit scam other than one large-ish withdrawal was made, which seemed to break the hot wallet. 800 BTC on a site that size is not an exit scam. The OBVIOUS conclusion to draw within the first few hours of an event like that is that the large-ish withdrawal simply depleted the hot wallet. No sensible site keeps a huge hot wallet with all their customer funds in.
Edit2: For the linguistically challenged, a re-cap:  A few people overreacted to the LBC wallet issue by claiming exit scam. News spread fast as it always does. A couple of hours later it turns out it wasn't an exit scam - confirming the majority opinion of other people that it was not a scam. It's the people that jump to conclusions and are very vocal about them that people find "toxic". The OP's choice of wording comes across as though he knows the price shift last night was because of this event, when again, the majority simply believe it was some traders, trading.

You could always use coin control to not include those inputs (several wallets support this). Also you could simply include a large fee that swallowed up the inputs but was significantly large enough to get the tx confirmed.

Yes p2p brokers like localbitcoins.com have a markup to cover, for the site and the seller/buyer but you do avoid international transfer fees and it all happens a lot quicker.
Banks are unlikely to actively support Bitcoin by doing anything automatically, but some sites have very smooth KYC procedures and as yourself and others have said - once it's done once, it's done and it's smooth from there onwards.

Decent advice. Another option is multiple small hot wallets that aren't connected to each other and have different logins etc. However, it's more likely that someone will trick your website into paying out from hot wallets rather than hacking the hot wallet servers themselves.

Maybe, maybe not. If they were going to exit scam you'd think they'd have done it Dec13 when the volume (and price) on btc-e was huge and LTC was worth a lot more. Or they'd have done it Apr13. $100mil of swag is enough for anyone, why hold out for $200m.
Also, one important difference, exit scams are all from illegal sites - they risk a lot to make their commission so it makes sense that they'd be more likely to throw in the towel when faced with the chance of walking away with a tonne of coin. btc-e is not illegal. Gox wasn't an exit scam.
And finally, btc-e has banking relationships, albeit masked and routed through here and there. I suspect if they did exit scam the authorities would eventually be able to trace their ID - they just do a good job of hiding it.
Maybe they will vanish one day, only they know. But I don't at all agree with you that they are "a cancer" for Bitcoin. Quite the opposite, I wonder how many first-time traders started on btc-e because it's so easy to set-up.

If you've got the keys, you've got the keys. That's all you need. Most Web wallets, software, full nodes, light nodes, etc. will allow you to import a private key. Once you have imported your key/keys it's a good idea to send the coins to a fresh address for security - if your wallet didn't already offer to "sweep" the funds into a fresh address for you.
Once you have found out what you have, which we know is the first thing anyone would want to do lol. Then find yourself a safe way to store them and use them, assuming it's more than a nice meals' worth of coin. Hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger are popular for larger amounts of bitcoin. The official Bitcoin Core is also quite popular if you don't mind the disk and network usage. Light wallets (headers only / SPV) like Electrum and web wallets like blockchain.info are the easiest for new users.

I like the idea of Stellar, web of trust, PGP and all that.. but.. I don't know.. Ethereum seems to have a lot of non-currency uses of Bitcoin sorted out and there's a lot of professionalism there.
Being in the UK Stellar appeals because it could be a great way, a great gateway, to being able to buy bitcoin without involving banks and centralised services more than required.. so it could have legs.. I'm just not convinced enough that the way they are going about it is the right way. I'm not discounting it just yet.

With all this blockchain speak over the past year or so Bitcoin seems inevitably falling into some kind of distributed database. Banks etc. will use their own private blockchains - that's nothing new, but a bunch of non-institutional companies will also jump on the bandwagon and start using Bitcoin for certain record keeping.
There are bound to be another wave of "bitcoin is unsafe" type news stories when some of these private blockchains fuck up.
The question in my mind is; Is there any room for a currency on the Bitcoin blockchain if every company and it's dog starts making OP_RETURN txs to store things. Also, why aren't they using Namecoin which is designed for this exact purpose and to prevent Bitcoin blockchain bloat with record storage?.. but that's a different rant.

1  Very simple to generate a bunch of addresses and store them in a database or whatever. No node required.
2  If you haven't got a copy of the blockchain (i.e. a node) then you can't check transactions. However there are several free APIs that will do this so at least you don't have to rely on a single 3rd party if you don't want to run a node.
3  You can't send a tx without the required details which are on the blockchain (i.e. the input transaction). You could get the input info from the APIs in  and then create a manual tx and push it to any node. Running your own heavily pruned node (i.e. ~1Gb disk usage) would be a good option for this.
Hope that helps.

To be honest, people put a lot more effort into cold storage than they do their own computer's security. If your computer is secure and well maintained then for a couple of coins here and there there's just no need for cold storage (unless you're some crazy perfectionist).
It's becoming a bit of a misnomer (or whatever the right word is) that bitcoin should be stored cold - yes sure, for exchanges and any other substantial holding of bitcoin it should be very carefully done. But for a regular user unless you are storing long term then just be sensible with your computer and your keys. You don't save your debit card details in a plain text file on your Desktop, so don't keep your bitcoin keys in plain text on your desktop.

Because if you upload your image then that 100kb or so will be downloaded/uploaded and stored by people over the globe for eternity, it would clog up automated Bitcoin systems/servers/automation and generally bloat the blockchain. And all for nothing, make sure the wayback machine archives your site and you can stick your selfie on the web forever on your own domain name rather than in some convoluted manner on a protocol not intended for what you are doing. If the population of the UK uploaded a selfie to the Bitcoin blockchain then that would add gigabyte after gigabyte to the blockchain and it would cause problems.

It is my understanding that the master pub key is a small security risk (like a std address pub key) whereas a standard address is no risk at all. 
I get HD wallets, there is one private key that unlocks all the other keys - how it does that I don't know the details... hopefully not by suffixing some kind of counter to the seed. Sure, if you keep all your standard addresses in one wallet.dat (or equiv) then it's the same, but you don't have to.
Also, isn't there an address linking issue with HD? Businesses don't want their detailed sales figures public.
PS:  I'm not hating on HD.. I like it, I would recommend it if I knew enough about it to do so. Same as SPV, if it suits the task it's an option if you know the details.

I agree this is probably just the start. The mining chip almost shouldn't be there as then the kit would be at least $100 cheaper and no newbie sucker is going to get sucked in by "mining". But, mining seems to be within the core of their business so I suspect it's pitched at "developers" with these additional tools because they want devs to test their chips in the real world and begin creating their marketplace etc.
The only point I can see for the miner is to enable non-monetary blockchain uses like storing hashes in OP_RETURN which you can do with just the miner's fee. But I'm pretty sure you'd get more tx from $100 of BTC right now than you'll ever mine with that kit.

An alternative to importing into something like BCi and then forwarding coins is to export each of the private keys with funds using 'dumpprivkey' in the bitcoin-qt console and then import into your chosen thin client. It's not a bad idea to import the wallet into BCi and then immediately send all the coins to a newly generated address though.
@_date: 2015-04-13 17:13:33
Painful? Most wallets either use a single encrypted file which you simply duplicate and store safely or they have a seed (a bunch of words) which you just need to keep safely. If it's a long-term storage backup then it's as simple as printing out the private key. No tools or tricks required.

Definitely the most easy and most secure way is to send all your BTC to a freshly generated address on the new client. If you're not in a hurry you'll get away with half the usual tx fee, i.e. 0.00005 .. provided there aren't too many inputs and none of them are dust.

Yeah you'll have to report that. Whatever income you get from your trading should be treated the same as any other income. Now if it's just trading as a hobby and annual losses/gains are small change then you don't need to bother but £11-12k is not small change.
Your personal tax allowance will cover most of it, you can earn £x per year without paying tax, you might be able to assign half of that to last year and half to this year meaning your personal allowance will cover the entirety of your profit without any tax - but you still gotta report it.
Not sure exactly how it would work with you having no records.. you'll have bank records for BTC purchased and you've got your current BTC balance so I'd just work from those. I think you have two choices how to report - 1) call it capital gains, for any BTC that you've cashed out to your bank - i.e. the same as if you sold an asset.  2) Set yourself up as a sole trader (in HMRC business terms), effectively a company but easier to report, set a tax year, fill in your HMRC tax form each year by entering purchases, sales, expenses - you don't need to detail individual trades - only balances, fiat deposits and fiat withdrawals.
I think capital gains has a higher threshold tax-wise but I'm not certain of that, but, I don't know if it's allowed to consistently put it through capital gains when you sell some BTC - I would think the Gov would want you to be a sole trader and account for it as if it were a profession, a job.
Call HMRC - they're really helpful.

Miners don't get instant payouts on pools, as the name suggests everything is pooled by the pool and they handle the distribution of the bitcoin - usually in large multi-output transactions paying multiple miners at once.
Solo miners (and the pools themselves) receive their payout instant through the coinbase transaction (the mining reward tx, not the company).

TL;DR:  Addresses that are shorter than the usual 34 characters have more characters available to them, because a bigger number can be used during the hashing process. That's about as short n' simple as I can get it.

I think if you're storing the actual data off the Bitcoin blockchain then you're losing nearly all of the security that Bitcoin offers and nullifying any reason to use the Bitcoin blockchain. Even if using the Bitcoin blockchain to store a key/hash to the off-chain record as a concept of "proof".
However, I am not an expert in Blockstore or other similar options, I think those tools have uses but not critical uses such as voting, ID, financial services, etc.

The entire market in the UK is a few percent over the true global rate for BTC. That's because you can't send domestic banking payments to exchanges and have to use middlemen - who of course take a cut.
That's just how it is here - the GBP rate will always be a few percent higher than wallets and websites think it is.
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:30:15
There is a new block every 10 mins on average, in reality it varies but the average is 10. If you make your tx 1 min before a new block appears and your fee is decent then you can expect it to confirm within 1 minute.
It's a big pot of pot luck how long for the first confirm but on average you shouldn't have to wait more than 10 mins a guess at the maths involved it would mean when you make a tx on average it will confirm within 5 mins.

Interesting. So effectively non-standard port full nodes are almost like a redundant backup system... standard nodes will try to connect to default ports first and will likely find enough to fill up it's 8 connections, only when they don't will they start trying nodes using other ports.
So if you want to run a full node but want to minimise the data usage - change your port!

They would likely be best doing what localbitcoins.com do and hold the BTC from the buyer themselves until the buyer confirms all is well then it is sent to the sellers address.

Aaah, so you have an implementation of storing hashes in a blockchain **without requiring** some other p2p node system alongside to store the actual data. Because, in your case the data itself is stored by the user as a "receipt". Have I got that right? If so, great - much better than other implementations I've seen that achieve the same thing.
Essentially it's a very elaborate and secure digital signature where the owner holds the private "key" (i.e. receipt)?

For starters it's "Bitcoin" (or "bitcoin" if you are referring to the unit of currency). e.g. "I really like the promise of the Bitcoin network, I think I'll buy myself a bitcoin".

The disproportionately high % of illegal stuff vs. cash is simply because there was a lot of early adoption there, and seemingly it works. The shady thefts and exit scams on those markets has nothing to do with the medium of money transfer, that's just part of that world, in cash or bitcoin.
These disproportionate illegal-related things will fade into insignificance as bitcoin is used more and more in the "real" world.

Usually mistakes/bugs/errors. That particular one you highlight was a user restoring an old wallet backup with some legacy script which had an overflow type error in certain situations. It caused an 85 BTC fee to be paid on a single tx if I remember correctly.

That's a really interesting point. In order for my wife's engagement ring to be insured I had to specifically declare it on the home insurance because it exceeded their maximum payout for an unregistered item. It actually costs me an extra 15% to have it insured which seems a lot given it's value. 
The problem with insuring bitcoin in a home is an interesting one. Cash in the home is insurable in the same way my wife's ring is - over a certain amount you must specify it and they will charge extra accordingly. Any bitcoin holdings would have to be denominated in FIAT I would think, so you couldn't insure 10 BTC but you could insure $3,000 of BTC. I think the main problem aside from that would be the Internet-connected nature of BTC..  a cold paper wallet is no different to cash in terms of theft but how does the insurer verify that it is indeed cold. That could be impossible.

People tend to do crypto-in, crypto-out with btc-e, so there are fewer fiat to crypto buys overall than on other exchanges. Which always has suppressed the price on there a little.
It's probably mostly because if you're going to use a bank transfer to buy bitcoin then you'll probably use an exchange in your country or at least one in a local country.

bitcoin transactions can be fee-free but generally it's wise to include a little incentive for the network to have your transaction submitted. with experience you'll know when you can get away with a tiny fee.
The point some miss when all of sudden they are like "wait what? a fee?".. is that the fee is the same regardless of value (in simple terms)..  you could send $50 or $500,000,000 and attach just a single penny fee.

It costs an amount of bitcoin, not an amount of dollars.
It also depends on how much you're sending, how complicated the transaction (e.g. number of inputs and outputs) and the age and size of the inputs.
It also depends on how quickly you need the tx to go through and how busy the network is at that moment.
But, a basic answer relating to today's dollar price is: if you've got a simple transaction to send then $0.015 is enough.

The only point I'd raise is in reply to your point  .. ATM's always have to hold cash - because you insert cash and get BTC out.

I'm not sure what the current status of a fix is, given it has been known about for so long it's probably low priority. It may be that the core devs feel it is an issue for wallet devs to handle and not a protocol level change - but don't quote me on that.

For me I got step 1 and step 2 then it threw me back to the main screen (no error). My deposit is listed as pending in the history. Must be teething problems.

It also takes a while to see the point of Reddit, to get into it. At first glance (and I remember my first few glances at this sub) it's like "WTF, a forum filled with 14yo trolls and peter todds... I'll give that a miss".
Once you learn to filter the noise, this sub is kinda invaluable if you are really serious about Bitcoin.

When you have an Internet connection all ports are open (generally) as that's what an Internet connection is. The responsibility for restricting access to the devices in your home/office is in your court.
Google "Shields up", click proceed, then click scan common ports. It will tell you what is open and give you some info etc. In 99% of cases you would desire all ports to be closed/stealth unless you specifically open them because you want other people to connect to you (as is the case when running a full node).
May be a simple explanation, might have been opened automatically with UPnP or whatever. I just think if you don't know what's doing what through your router then it's not a good security situation, especially when bitcoin is involved.
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:42:32
I would guess from your description that your email account is compromised. Possibly via PC/browser malware or maybe good old explanations such as social engineering, using the same password elsewhere, basic ID theft, etc.

I don't think product X or service Y launching alone will make the price bubble again. I think traders will. The same traders who have regularly pushed the price down for months will at some point turn the other way and do the opposite, when they feel it is right to do so. Other traders will follow suit. Then there will be a whole new bandwagon for people to jump on - the difference this time around compared with previous bubbles is there is real awareness of Bitcoin now, even some actual trust in it from the masses... could be a lot of people on the bandwagon this time round. Of course, it's all just speculation. Anything could happen.
As for killer apps, could be anything, but places like Overstock and Neteller have shown that people do use Bitcoin even though it can still be a chore to obtain.

It's been a loooong time since I coded .bat scripts and I cant remember, but you may get away with something like below because the script will take that whole thing as a string without you having to worry about escaping the quotes. If not then lookup what the escape char is (it might be double quotes) then you might get it working cmdline.
    set multistr='["02471e90aafaf4ff24f30f9c069655d69fe8b0c7199a5a45bb8d13ff2214dcb150","027f8f84e44a14268fdd4b2ca160f90f9890e80c83cd6c5b1bb8e8e86718d116f0","03a22fe9875f442d6ea58a4ac72da7b3ba70d4c48e493460827ee1c24a3b972f05"]'
    
    c:\path\to\bitcoin-cli createmultisig 2 %multistr%
If it is double quotes to escape try...
    c:\path\to\bitcoin-cli createmultisig 2 "'[""02471e90aafaf4ff24f30f9c069655d69fe8b0c7199a5a45bb8d13ff2214dcb150"",""027f8f84e44a14268fdd4b2ca160f90f9890e80c83cd6c5b1bb8e8e86718d116f0"",""03a22fe9875f442d6ea58a4ac72da7b3ba70d4c48e493460827ee1c24a3b972f05""]'"

It's also a whole load easier to send someone 954.3522 bitcoin or whatever through trusted escrow than it is to cash it out and order a withdrawal and then send it on to some legal company, maybe involving a bank visit/call, who then forwards it to the seller and eventually after all the "clearing" you exchange keys.

luke-jr has your problem. I didn't realise you were on doze. You might be able to do it via a .bat script and variables rather than directly on the commandline but to be honest just run a lightweight headless debian install on VirtualBox or an old PC and use Linux.

Not that I know of. Though, you could use nLockTime perhaps to create the return tx at the same time as the initial tx - if time &gt; nLockTime then that tx will execute to return your coins assuming an RBF miner validates it.

They're probably offering the best that they can and have to sell their product 'cause that's business. Most cloud mining customers probably don't really know what they're buying they just want to "mine bitcoins". It's a free market, let them I say.

I looked into this as I run a vouchercode-to-bitcoin type service, but let's say you paid $/£/€ 10.00 for your premium rate SMS I would get something crazy like $/£/€ 3.00 so once margins and overheads are taken into account you would end up with $/£/€ 2.50 of bitcoin for your 10.00
It would only be used by fraudsters at those rates.

Bitcoin is *really exciting* at the moment, possibly more so than the 2013 bubbles because this time it's nothing to do with hype - Bitcoin is growing up, governments are taking note. The paradigm shift has started. I no longer feel bad for not being around in the millionaire-making 2011-2012 period when I really should have been - because I am here for the real thing - adoption, recognition, real-world uses.

Have an upvote ;-)  What you've said is fine. I just think people shouldn't be surprised if an unverified account causes them issues - I'm surprised Neteller are allowed to offer one to be honest.
I suppose depositing with bitcoin to an unverified account, along with any other anonymous-ish methods such as Ukash probably does flag the account - since that's what a nefarious user would also use.

I think over the coming decade where adoption increases, larger institutions use it for asset transfer, etc. that dormant coins will be less and less.. there is probably a disproportionately high % of them at the moment because of all the early miners and of course Satoshi's coins. 
Also, if you assume the protocol works as designed then the value of 1 bit will, over the long term, rise.. therefore each person who may potentially lose their coins will hold less and less coins. It's widely accepted that if Bitcoin "makes it" that very few people will even own 1 bitcoin nevermind 50 bitcoin, therefore if they lose their coins it's a lot less of a problem than if some 2011 miner lost their coins. 
And finally, of course, there are still several million coins still to be mined.. the total supply of mined coins even now probably outstrips the amount of lost coins.
I'm not saying your idea is stupid, or wrong. I think it will just cause more harm than good and I don't understand your point that lost coins somehow causes a trust problem.

It is random luck I believe, if a block is solved a block is solved - regardless of when the last block was or how many transactions it contains.. if the maths fits, the network accepts it.

I suggest you get used to manual trading first, automated trading is great but it's automated - one slight error and you could lose money.

I think I agree with you, from a profit point of view. Though of course you have to consider the chances of 1 bitcoin becoming $10,000 or whatever crazy figure. I still run a 2013 KnC miner for the hell of it.
I've wanted to invest something in mining for at least 12 months, for nostalgia just as much as profit - but like you I can't see anywhere to put my non-commercial amount of funds unless it's entirely on the whim that btc might be 5-figures one day.

There's a jewellers near Manchester if I recall correctly, maybe they could supply gold/silver.
You can have gold/silver delivered to UK from various services - bitgild is one I have used.

Updating will be effectively mandatory I believe. All the miners, pools, processors, exchanges, power users, etc will have updated so if you don't update then your coins will be quite useless until you do.

@_date: 2015-03-23 18:19:38
You're exaggerating there tbh. With the exception of Satoshi's coin (if he even owns the keys any more) I doubt there are many users at all who could dump enough bitcoin to harm the market and they also probably don't want to. Don't forget even 20,000 bitcoin sold in an hour is barely enough to move the price 1% if the owner cares about slippage... if they don't care about slippage then they are a manipulator and there is zero you can do about manipulators.

It was the ability to withdraw from an ISA and pay back into it without the preventative limit (because the current limit doesn't take into account withdrawals).

There is virtual ram / swap disk space too - so once free RAM is all full the disk will be used, until that is full too - then the node will likely fail. [remember on Linux "free RAM" isn't like it is on windoze and 80% RAM usage may actually be more like 50%]

Never used them but I'd suspect the following applies:
a)  You will need a verified account in order to purchase.
b)  When you purchase the coins will be added to your account, which you can then withdraw to bitcoincore or any other wallet.
c)  If a) is the case then yes they are traceable.

100.00% uptime is unrealistic. Possible but unrealistic, especially with such a security concious type service as this. Hell, my online banking service goes down once a week usually for "scheduled maintenance" despite being probably the biggest bank in the UK.
Brief downtime once in a while is PERFECTLY acceptable and should be EXPECTED. However, I do agree with people that BCi seem to have totally taken their eye off the ball for at least a year. I use their service far, far less than I used to - not because I'm worried about security.. because they're losing their goodwill, their loyal users.. people are starting to look elsewhere.

They added that bitcoin bit at the end of 2013, before that Neteller was pretty good for trading (e.g. localbitcoins.com) and is the only reason I have a Neteller account. As soon as they changed those terms they started reversing transactions despite supposedly being a no-reversal policy.. sellers started getting screwed by fraudsters.
I think if you want to buy bitcoin with the debit card, from a reputable service then you'll be fine, but I'd avoid personal funds transfers for bitcoin trades until they clarify.
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:29:57
Yes age (days to be destroyed), size (bytes), size (value) and number of inputs/outputs are all factors.

Miners have known for a long while now that the game was going to get tough, it was an obvious conclusion given the staggeringly rapid advancements in ASICs and the technical difficulties in improving on those ASICs. Most hobby miners let their old hardware expire and haven't replaced it. That's why people are worried that it is becoming too centralised, because a lot of the hash rate is provided by large commercial mines now. It might stay that way or it might return to more of an equilibrium where hobby miners can earn a few quid too, but for now it's an exercise of fun only (or cloud 9 speculation I guess).

SSD is not a suitable long-term storage option unless you have backups. As you've found out.
If it were a physical disk you'd have more chance (a good chance) of recovery.
I would suggest booting up into linux, one of the "live" cd/usb versions will do.. you can then firstly use *dd* to make a byte-by-byte dump of the drive, if that works you're probably good. If that doesn't you'll have to resort to *ddrescue* and hope that the bit with your private key is recoverable.
However, because it's SSD.. you may find it is 100% dead. A good data recovery specialist may be able to replace the controller etc. if the actual data chips are OK - but that will be expensive.
@_date: 2015-10-31 18:45:43
Not really unless you use a service like onename or changetip.
You can create a Namecoin ID (e.g. /id/darw007) which has a bitcoin address assigned to it (that's how OneName used to work until they switched to another method).
Back in the day there were First Bits but not any more as the idea is widely discredited.

I had a chuckle over the Lorem Ipsum on the competition page :)
It's a good site, I like it and would potentially use it in the future. 
If I were you I would either receive the bitcoin payments manually for now (fill a database/wallet with addresses for your checkout and build in some notifications for example).. or simply use someone like BitPay or GoCoin. CoinCorner may be of interest because it an exchange and payment processor in one, I think they do EUR. You can add your own custom bitcoin implementation when you're more experienced with it.
I would guess you are likely to cash out the majority of received bitcoin quite quickly so cold storage may not be required, just forward the coins to an exchange. If you only use each address once then it's straightforward to match payments to orders just as you would a bank statement.
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:29:38
If you already run a full node you could install bitcoin core on your desktop too and set it to only connect to your node (connect=ip.of.node in the config file).. it will sync pretty quickly if your full node is local, making it run a bit like a light client.

Public perception/understanding has improved greatly.
Trading/Price not a huge amount though volume has been picking up again.
Investments/Services have all improved with some major non-exchange businesses growing. Businesses are improving their systems and functionality.
Development..  hehe well, we've had some great code updates in the past year but the consensus issue has marred that, however, debating consensus and how to approach it in the future even if it takes a long, long time is a very beneficial discussion.
Network/nodes/mining have been fairly static - a bunch of stupid stress tests is about the only development there. New node hardware has been appearing, new mining hardware not so much but still developments.
Other digital currencies..  Obviously there's Ethereum which could go somewhere. Litecoin is still alive and strong. Namecoin took some hits in the past year but is looking positive now (just about). MaidSafe seem to be making progress and tools like Storj have been launched with seeming success. Most of the rest of the altcoins have pretty much just fizzled out as expected.

Perhaps just import the private key for that 19EMbc address into blockchain.info and send the coins with that - if you do a "custom transaction" you can point any change back to your multibit wallet.
tbh a lot of people have minor issues with MultiBit, I've never used it myself but you could try another wallet in future, for example Electrum.

Direct debits are reversible for up to 180 days and the bank is very unlikely to favour on the side of the receiver.

Hehe Reddit is a special place. 
Others have explained for you but I will too anyway, the fee for a bitcoin transaction is based on the number of inputs, age of inputs, number of outputs and therefore transaction size in bytes. The value of the transaction is irrelevant. A single input being sent to a single address after having not moved for a while will almost certainly go through with a zero fee or something tiny like 0.00005... whereas a transaction with lots of inputs (e.g. a mining payout address with lots of 0.01 inputs), some of which are recent inputs, will definitely need a fee for a quick transaction, 0.0001 should do it.
The new version of bitcoin core 0.10 has improved fee handling. Personally I just go for 0.00005 if it's a simple tx or I don't mind waiting a couple of hours. Otherwise 0.0001 if I'm in a hurry or it's not a simple tx.

So from that translation I get that they had a auto-topup system for their hot wallet, and somehow the hacker managed to trigger the hot wallet to topup with the entire contents of the semi-cold wallet before looting the lot. 
Hopefully they have an actual cold wallet too with the majority of the funds in it because I wouldn't call a wallet that can automatically empty itself "cold".

No complaints here overall it is better, the home page is a bit silly and a lot of viewers are just going to get lag, but the actual trading pages are basically the same as they were before with a bit of a re-skin.

What zenkz said. Once you have a good feedback rating on localbitcoins you'll have no problems buying and selling coins very quickly. You could also keep say $100 on an exchange such as BitStamp and when you need some bitcoin use their system to buy what you need and withdraw instantly. If you don't want to send a bank transfer directly to an exchange then use LBC and send bitcoin to the exchange and sell for USD (or whatever fiat).
I know, I know, it's not 100% convenient. Blame the scammers and government regulations, not Bitcoin.

Yes it's pretty similar. You can trade plain BTC&lt;-&gt;FIAT or margin/leverage trade or futures trade or binary trade etc. You also have the option of trading pairs such as BTC/LTC - with no FIAT side.  Most of the major exchanges are fairly reliable and yes HFT is fine so long as you're not spamming the API.
For maximum liquidity you would trade on several exchanges, but most of the main ones will easily handle trades of 6 figures (fiat). Some even have tools to help you such as OKCoin who have options for iceberg trades for example.
As a starting point I think you'll find the BTC/EUR market on Kraken a good platform.

Happens to me once every 2-3 months I'd say where I'm waiting more than 40 mins for a block. But it depends on how many transactions you regularly do as to how often you'll be affected.

They aren't actually individual coins so there is no code for a bitcoin, but rather transaction inputs. They would look like a bunch of hexadecimal characters to designate the specific input. The blockchain (i.e. the network/protocol) knows how much each input is worth and whether it has been spent.

1)  I just install and leave it, the download time doesn't bother you if you don't watch it :)
2)  Sybil attack btw is the name for running many nodes in an attempt to gleam data from the network that you couldn't get running a small number of nodes. 
3)  There has been some media attention recently and bitnodes have their incentive thing. Attacks aside a small number of nodes won't harm Bitcoin.
4)  Yes I've run several nodes for a couple of years. Once sync'd you don't notice they are there other than the RAM usage, they rarely crash but I do have a monitor to auto-start if they do. The Litecoin and Namecoin nodes are a lot less hungry than Bitcoin.
If you want to help further I'm sure adding Tor to your node will help the network, it's not difficult to set-up.

I think the technicality is that when you use something like Uber it reserves a certain amount when starting the ride to ensure that you can pay for the ride, but takes a different amount at the end based on how much the ride actually cost. This is probably difficult for Xapo as the bitcoin price is so volatile. I know when I tried to use mine with Uber it didn't work.
