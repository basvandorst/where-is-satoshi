Full Disclosure: I approached the candidate and asked that they start accepting Bitcoin. Credit to Mark Warden in New Hampshire for being the pioneer on this front.

they are looking for ways to spend the BTC directly, with things like printing and ads. They are holding it as BTC until they can find a way to use BTC directly during the campaign.

I live in Detroit and will be going here soon. This is the first place to take BTC to my knowledge.

We already did everything we could. Please contact coinbase to disable two-factor authentication.
Their support team had a number of rude emails to me and just kept saying there was nothing they could do.
