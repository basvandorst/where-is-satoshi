Houses didn't really store value as much as they tended to be inflationary due to frac reserve lending to buy houses. Not that I am complaining has I own (well selling home while market is hot) but I know that the reason housing prices go up as much as they do is that loans are made to pay for them where as if there no loans, lower prices would have be accepted.

On an aside to you both... 2008 is 2008 and what they did seemed to work for the most part in avoiding 30% unemployment.
That said... You can never use 2008 as a model of how to behave in the future event. As BTC didn't exist back then and China is at a point it doesn't need to buy our treasuries anymore.
Also we have a President who believes that tariffs can save an economy. As Ichan put it: "It helped bring the crash in 1929. I'm not a great supporter of that."
So yeah... Whatever happens in future will be completely different and we won't be able to QE our way out of it especially since we haven't even got back to 5% rates yet.

I know I'm going to get downvoted all to hell, but in one of my financial markets class in college we discussed what are the signs of a bubble. One of them is when average people (non financial) start buying in on the peak. Basically this is the last source of financing and once they all invest there is no more money to push the bubble higher. This isn't specific to crypto but housing prices and stocks.
What happens is that when normies buy in they put too much of their disposable income in and then when the long term holders decide to cash out a bit and the price drops too much the normies freak out and sell everything causing everyone to panic.
I say this because I have been getting a lot of questions from friends and relatives who know nothing about finances or technology about bit coin.
(I tell them that like all investments you should not go all in... least they panic sell)

True. If you were a normie and invested in the SP500 in 2007 at its peak before the crash and then bag holded all the way through the economic crisis you would have still made money today. Same would apply to Bitcoin if you view it as a long term hold. However, the people who needed to withdraw some money for retirement etc were screwed.

My theory. Bitcoin will drop with stocks and bonds as people flee to cash UNTIL central banks   deploy negative interest rates.
And then cash holders try to remove their cash from banks and have a rude awakening. 
(AKA ���� 2010)
Then Bitcoin will have a super moon.

I'm not sure you got the tautology of the word "censorship" right. You can self-censor and that is technically censorship by the spirit of the word. I think what you are confusing is censorship in the legal sense of government censorship versus private censorship.
Whereas government censorship is mostly illegal (well except for state secrets and national security) while private censorship is usually mostly legal (unless discriminates on the basis of race, religion, or sex IANAL though).
But again, don't equate ethical with being legal either.
You can be highly unethical while doing something legal and you can be ethical by breaking the law.
TLDR Private groups can censor in the spirit of the definition, but its legal to do so but it can be unethical depending on the situation.
While I'm pointing that out, I'd rather Bitcoin stay Bitcoin and if I want to read about alts, I would go elsewhere.

Yeah. It wouldn’t be that hard. There are large investment companies that deal in BTC day trading and other things. Former Fortess guy I think and an old school stock trader who made himself 20 million richer since January or so.
Anyways... All she would need to do is signs contract and rent would market move it for 20%.
Basically, on Wall Street when a large investor wants to get out of a company without crashing the price they hook up with one of these people.
They line up dozens if not hundreds of buyers at an agreed to price (usually lower but close to market value) and handle the transactions and keep the activity discreet so it just looks like a bunch of trades over a longer period of time than someone just dumping 10% of the company all at one time.
Also, investors usually never sell all their investments so she could go to one of these people on Wall Street and they would maybe sell $1 million per week in different exchanges over a 6 month period and so on to get maybe $100 million and maybe shift the rest around into other vehicles.

Hrm... I heard one is the SEC chair Hester Pierce actually say on a podcast that she felt it wasn’t an impossibility but they needed to really read their comments on why they were rejecting and adjust according. She wouldn’t come out and say they would approve it at some point in the future but she pointed out they have ETFs on more complicated stuff but they needed to do this right (almost got the feeling she didn’t want to destroy the world economy without due diligence).
Which means they are not opposed to ever having a Bitcoin ETF, it’s just they really don’t want to go down as the people that ruined the economy so they are being overly stringent.
It was that “What Bitcoin did” podcast.

Fun fact the Italian banking families of the 1370’s invented (or at least reinvented as Romans and Chinese had this years earlier) IOUs or promissory notes because they and their customers were literally tired of hiring mercenaries in what was basically Mount and Blade Warband to (city states were always at war) to guard slow moving carts of gold, silver, and other valuables when they can just write a note and send a guy on a horse with a IOU note that if he meets a guy hopping out of a bush shouting “I will drink from your skull”. No big loss.
Also it cut down on the hired mercenaries from having gold fall off the wagon suspiciously near a brothel.
The idea is that if you had arrived with a shit ton of goods and sold it and then you needed to travel to next city but didn’t want to hire guards or just make a bunch of trips with small hidden pouches, you could just buy a promissory note at one bank and then take it the bank at the other place and then that family bank would take the note after your trip and give you gold for it. Then later the two families would get together and compare notes and see if any actually currency or goods would need to be traded to balance up.
Or get political favors... most of time just swapping notes.
Of course Medici probaly had a few people stabbed over not paying up or trying to pass off fake notes.

Keep your HODL on a hardware wallet. When you want to spend... Send $20 to $30 to like a Jaxx wallet that if you lost your phone you’d be more concerned about the phone than your crypto wallet.
Then just spend from that wallet as needed and recharge as needed.
On an aside there really needs to be a really crappy wallet like the old Jaxx that just has no back up so it doesn’t force you keep a damn 30 passphrase setup.

People will call customer service and try to get as much information about the account as possible acting like somewhere who has misplaced their information. Maybe talk to 10 to 20 employees before getting the full picture as 1 out of 3 give away a extra bit of personal info about the account. It really grinds my gears when I am talking to customer service and they just tell me something about my personal account without verification.
Or they could yell at people until they just give up and reset the account password.

Well here is the deal about SMS. Technically its secure as the phone is on your person and how gullible the representative that answers the phone at your wireless company is to be talked too in switching SIM card to a new device (which by all accounts isn't that hard to do as a few high profile persons got their twitter hacked when someone called up saying they were their handler and they needed to a switch to a new phone).
Authenticator apps on your phone are a bit more secure, but you need a print out of one time codes in a safe place somewhere as if you drop your phone in a toilet, you might have problems getting back in without them which is by design.
Other security for bitcoin could be something like a Trezor bitcoin wallet which a friend of mine recommended and so far it seems pretty good.

Statiscally people who don't have a team to analyze the markets will do better holding than trying to retrace price swings because if you sell expecting the price to go down the your fucked if it only goes up from there or vice versa.
If your really good at it or have a trading bot that actually works then yeah day trade. But for average person who isn't an expert, it's better to buy and hold (this is what the teach in stock market theory).
Also holding prevents panic selling and greed buying.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:27:19
I probably shouldn't tell you this but buying only long to day trade is actually for chumps.
If you want to make gains on buying and selling, options and futures is where it's at. And I've seen signs there are going to be exchanges that support this.
You would need to read several books and watch hours of videos, but there are options plus long strategies that make people who simply buy on swings look like they were medieval peasants.
And I'm not recommending you do this because it's can get really complex with the methods and there is risk.
Also forgot to mention, the majority of mutual fund managers can't beat the SP500 passive index actively trading.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:18:04
Eh. That was the point of the point of the article. If you bought in at height of the tech bubble in 2001 and held through 2001 and 2008 you would have some major gains.
And if you bought at height of 2007 and held through crash of 2008 you would have tripled your money on SP500.
Now BTC might not behave the same as the SP500 because it's not an index.
But here is something else to chew on... Traders whose used algorithms to set hard rules on trading did way better than traders that used their instincts (which is why Goldman is replacing 300 traders with computers. You can google it).
If you buy and sell based on your emotions you get fucked sometimes. Which is why either you need to be emotionless with your trading (there are real people like this) or you need a bot with a set of rules that work.
Hence why holding works better for people who sell on fear and buy on hype. AKA most people.

Oh yeah... I’ll be the first to tell you keeping everything on an exchange is a bad idea.
But ok. Here is the problem with gold. It’s not very coercion proof and localized.
I actually have been dealing with silver for a while and everyone wants to play pawn star with the spot price. It’s annoying  and also I can’t ship gold or silver internationally.
Yeah gold bugs harp about the intrinsically awesome it is but you cannot ship gold or silver overseas. Also post office won’t insure gold or silver but i deal in coins so I can claim numismatic value.
Did I mention I hate people playing pawn stars?
Also I have to safety deposit box. Along with home defense and alarm which if the police show up and confiscate because they claim I’m a drug dealer then I’m SOL.
With crypt I just have a hardware wallet and PIN
I can send and receive anywhere in the world.
It’s not 100% coercion proof but there is plausible deniability. And I just give wrong PIN to lock device while they can just find the gold  and silver if they tear up the floor boards.

Energy has a better use case than gold.
Gold is valuable because it’s rare and shiny. Besides some use in electronics (rare earth stuff is better though), you can’t eat it, can farm with it, fuel cars, make robots. It just sits there.
With BTC, it’s backed by electricity so I think it’s a better container of value.

Look. It promotes the incentive to find cheaper energy while all the TV’s and smart phones in US consume way more power and people accept the loss rather than finding better ways of getting energy.
Unless you are the power company and can build a nuclear reactor, chances are you will look into investing in alternative energy as you can only ask the power company to lower your bill so much before they say “No.”
The idea is that if you are a miner you will seek cheaper energy and then market forces come into play with future research into efficiency and methods.
Remember the Apple ][ in 1984 was no way in hell cost efficient for what you could do with it.
But it laid the ground word via early adopters to what we have today. Super computers in our hands for less cost.
Therefore it is a natural economic incentive for both more efficient computers and more efficient energy production. Which will reduce the energy consumption in long term when it carries over to consumer devices which have no incentives.
Which is way more incentive than raising taxes on gas *coughs*

Well true. Everyone is eventually paid but the civilian contractors I knew always complained about being sent home for the week.
I lived near camp Le June and went to a community college and would hear civilian contractors and their family members complain about shutdowns.
There were actual marines in the classes but generally they weren’t affected as they were often already on the GI bill for school.
But the civilian contractors complained the most because I guess they just had nothing to do during this time whereas the marines would still work their jobs. This was under one of the shutdowns under Obama I recall.

I would argue chart reading is like tea leave reading when is often emotional news based. TA can’t predict Xi waking up saying they are banning Bitcoin our SEC saying they are going to allow every ETF ever suggested retroactively. Yes it’s improbable but so where our elections.
TA can’t predict that. Any who says otherwise is a liar.
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:20:34
I have a vague finance background which let me get to hang with investors.
Most investment banks frown on TA although it’s a fact that 1/3 of Wall Street before 2016 used TA.
That said 70% of active fund managers failed to beat the market using active methods using either TA or fundamentals.
Passive investing in indexes (the SP500 version of HODL) seems to work better than TA.
Now there was a discussion about why this was because TA in the 1980’s was wildly profitable.
Some suspect when non institutional investors got into the scene in the early 2000’s it broke the model because they reacted to emotion based news which made chart reading ineffective and people like Vanguard were laughing at everyone by making billions with their passive investing setups.
Also TA has a bit of back tracking where people prove their future predictions right but showing how the models worked in a past instance but if you have ever read a prospectus the first thing it say is “Past performance does not guarantee future results”.
Even if the SP500 has historically went up since 1929... It may just one day fail to do so.
Not that TA can still make money but studies have show that people just flipping coins have same results in historical models.
PS The active traders who were beating markets were often doing stuff like shorts and options along side longs which the average investor has a hard time getting their head around.
