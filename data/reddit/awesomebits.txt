In 6 months we will see the effects of all of these new micropayment platforms that are emerging today.  I think we will see a trend towards anonymity and privacy.  Tipping is not something that is traditionally broadcast to everyone in the room.  When I tip the waiter at the restaurant, I don't tell everyone there how much I'm tipping.  That would be ludicrous.  I think tipping applications that seek to provide anonymity, privacy, and decentralization will gain traction in the next six months.

Full Text:
IF YOU’VE DRIVEN on Santa Clara’s Lawrence Expressway sometime in the past six months, you may have seen the Bitcoin honey badger. He’s on a billboard between the El Camino Real (the road that once served as the major traffic artery from San Francisco to San Jose) and Highway 101 (the modern-day equivalent).
Roger Ver pays for the billboard, forking over about $1,500 a month. It’s located about half a mile from Ver’s company, Memorydealers, a computer-parts reseller that in 2011 became the first company to accept bitcoins — a digital currency that exists only on the internet — in exchange for real-world products. With the billboard, Ver is encouraging others to follow his lead.
The billboard housed a variety of other Bitcoin ads before the honey badger, but it’s the honey badger that really caught on. It has become a beacon for those who believe that digital currency is destined to take over the financial world.
It plays off an existing meme. The honey badger became the internet’s ultimate snake-eating, beehive busting badass after a January 2011 video on the animal went viral. “Honey badger don’t care” is the family-friendly version of the video’s catch phrase. With his billboard, Ver is applying that same attitude to Bitcoin, an open source system controlled by no one that lets you store and transmit money without the big banks and credit card companies.
Thanks to Ver’s billboard, you can now buy Bitcoin honey badger t-shirts, and the little devil crops up in all kinds of pro-Bitcoin images across the net. “The Bitcoin honey badger has made its way all over the internet,” says Ver. It’s a meme within a meme.
The meme’s message is especially resonant today, as China has taken steps in the past weeks to clamp down on Bitcoin trading, a move that sent the value of a bitcoin plummeting. The believers don’t care what the Chinese government does, and their numbers are growing, as Silicon Valley takes begins to embrace the currency in a big way.
“Silicon Valley is a great place for Bitcoin, since everyone understands computers, and there are lots of libertarians running around,” Ver says. He plans to keep the honey badger up “until I think of some other interesting idea for the billboard.”
The point, he says, is that — for people who see Bitcoin as a game-changing, frictionless payment system — it doesn’t really matter what the currency is trading at. Bitcoin’s recent price drop is bad news for speculators, but for the honey badger true believers, it doesn’t really matter.
Says Ver: “I don’t think Bitcoin cares what the Chinese or American politicians do.”

They were tipping celebrities and other people who do not need tips, and I imagine that those tips were larger to try to attract their attention.

Great Point!  Why do we want to give Facebook more data about ourselves?  It seems like centralizing an activity that should be decentralized.  We don't need a company to facilitate the transaction of bitcoin.  It is Peer to Peer.  I send it...you receive it.  I don't have to send money to facebook and have them forward it to you by charging a bank.  Think about that, You have to give even more sensitive data to facebook, who then uses that data to contact a banking institution to initiate a transaction to facebook, who then creates a transaction to your bank.  Bitcoin is so much simpler.

IMHO Stock traders, and stock tools have cause the massive decrease in price.  The ability to short such a small volatile market was not an option until recent times.  This ability to short the market, and the exchanges allowing people to short the market without having the funds, has further caused price decline.

I think it's possible, even probable that the investors in ChangeTip's last round, really just put their money in as part of diversification of funds and as a potential way to encourage Bitcoin adoption which would benefit their portfolio as a whole.

It's great to see statistics about Changetip come out.  Unfortunately, the statistics you posted are quite misleading.  
This is not how a VC would want the stats.  They would ask:  How many new users do you get per month?  How much is the user acquisition cost?  How many users actively tip, ie more than 5 times a month?  What percentage of tips is done by Changetip employees and affiliates?
