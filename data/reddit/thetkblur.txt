Wait until you have FOMO.
Seriously, what is your investment horizon? Do you understand the fundamental technological, economic, and political issues?
Are you looking to double you money and then sell, or looking for a capital loss for tax benefits?

Wondering if anyone has ideas on pricing/business models? Would it include ransomware consulting? Percentage of investment if speculating/investing (might run into regulatory troubles in US with this)? General corporate strategies?
