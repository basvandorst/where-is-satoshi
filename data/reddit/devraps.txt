Given that it looks like the guy in the background has chop sticks, is this Peter Todd trying to make an Asian face as a joke at a restaurant? 
On subject, is the bullshit storm re the block size just engineered non-consensus for the sake of making bitcoin seem like it can't get its shit together? Or to put artificial pressure on the ecosystem in the hopes that bitcoins code could mis step and tweak something that opens an attack vector in the future...?

I second this, as someone who paid 25,000 for my schooling and barely used it. Everything you want to learn you can learn online, think outside the box, find a mentor, travel to learn under them, get involved and be a student of life. You can supplement with night classes later. 
I don't want to discourage you as you are young, if your parents are assisting you with education costs and they are appropriate price costs, this is still a great option.
The key: take understanding into your own hands, never rely on anyone to teach you, learn how to learn and teach yourself. That is the best reinforcement loop you can have while here on earth.
And congrats :) put a new Bitcoin address for tips on your blog (or whatever presence you leave online) and learn that aspect of self monetization!
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:57:50
Um.. No you're not - just because addresses are filtered through electrum servers doesn't mean I am trusting a third party.
In that sense any wallet is trusting a third party since you have to trust their code. But that is not typically viewed as your coins being controlled by a third party.

Wright could have just been saying that to give her a sense that klienman had done something big and incredible and over her level of understanding and he was a partner that needed to come and pick up the software or whatever.

This is the key. Paypal wants some of those BTC it sees the power of the blockchain. Once PP makes Bitcoin users out of everyone they will just download a wallet on the side and ditch em, but by then PP will have some BTC stored up and won't get left behind.
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:00:28
If you're on android, download Mycelium or get a buddy to download - pool your money with your thug gang, use mycelium local trader to find a bitcoin trader in your area, go there with cash, don't go alone to be safe bring someone - exchange cash for BTC - split it up to you wallets and boom.
Using mycelium is better than local bitcoin's because most traders are on both but mycelium doesn't need you to sign up/put in username/email... Also fees can be better without localbitcoins.com
The seller will most likely charge a premium - calculate the amount and compare it to exchanged value - anything from a 3-5% markup is GREAT (all vendors charge fees) 5-9% is acceptable, anything above 10% market value is getting a little expensive and I wouldn't buy.
Also, mycelium has ratings and escrows, so read up on each user and see who seems most well reviewed.
Finally, try and befriend the guy, chances are he has bitcoin buddies and is connected to the local bitcoin events, if you get along you can probably just text him to meet for a coffee and that allows you easy access to BTC in the future and maybe he'll lower his fees - welcome to the community!

Hey man, exactly, Bitcoin was partially created to allow users to hold their own funds without a third party - If your using Blockchain.info or Coinable or Circle etc etc, then really you are using a wallet that you don't own. It's kinda like me saying "Hey I'm a bitcoin service, sign up to my site and send your BTC to the address I give you - don't worry though, the address you're sending it to is "yours", but I have a copy of your private key, so I have access to the funds too"
You can send it to an offline wallet like a paper wallet, or CryptoCard (inexpensive option) or Trezor (expensive option)
Does that make sense?

I highly doubt they will announce this, but while we're on the subject of fan fiction I can imagine a futuristic Scotland with a bustling mega-city paradise of solar powered infrastructure and tonnes of data servers dedicated to an empowered free autonomous collective of brilliant liberty minded folks. 
Decentralized voting, decentralized money, legalization of psychedelic drugs, decentralized communication networks. They would lead the free world.

I'd be careful. I installed it and got it going after a bit of hassle and was using it as a watch only account as a test. So I scanned my master public seed from my other wallet and it was great for a few weeks - now I can't get the app to run.. Will post a screenshot in a few minutes...

Half assed fun fact which deserves bitcoin tips: Turns out the cologne scent "eau de toilette" really means toilet water. In medieval times poor people would steal rich people's toilet water which was soaked with flowers to prevent the smell and give it to others to put on their skin to smell nice. Heard it once, never looked it up, have been telling people ever since. U be the judge!
TL:DR - poor people in medieval times poured toilet water on themselves to smell nice.

When Im Bitcoining: 
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:08:21
So I clicked restore and restored from qr code using my master public key - now the wallet seems to be in the phone working. When I click to go to settings it says password "no" and if I click it it pops up saying "incorrect password" if i click seed it says "incorrect password" I've tried sending funds and it gives me a "TX rejected ucode 22" error - does this mean it worked? I just want to make sure that my wallet is not vulnerable - I've only entered the master public key - to be clear - there's no way a master public key can be reverse engineered to provide a private key? I wish there was better documentation for this and better error handling...

Not my company just tired of seeing endless posts of people losing their coins because they don't have cold storage - referring them to that site (which I have used) is way easier than constantly explaining how to use a paper wallet since they have good videos on their site that do it easier. But point taken, I'll ease off it wasn't trying to inflame anything.

Yea absolutely bogus reason, I would have a reddit bitcoin address, all donations come thru that and I can shuffle em around if I want. Sheesh, I feel this is a no brainer, by I would prefer a magnet link to a wallet so it's convenient not having to whip a phone out.

I agree - this is a great idea, do we have any dev in the house?
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:59:12
Well, I'm not a genius dev, but any time you make something more complicated you introduce new ways it can be manipulated...
Here is an example simple code:("MaxBlockSize=1MB")
Changing that to 20MB is easy, rewriting a whole paragraph of code that does something else with a moving value introduces complexity that can be targeted for a loophole / bug.
(Obviously the shitty code example is just to decribe a point, not actually bitcoin code)
@_date: 2015-05-21 06:41:58
I agree, you favor exponential growth algo? Or 20mb? 1000mb?
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:00:42
I'll be more clear. I have a wallet on my PC I've used 5 different addresses on. I have no way of tracking them on my android unless I add in each address and manually add them... There must be a better way I'm hoping
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:09:24
"My suggestion would be to buy ChangeTip, integrate it, and become the largest bitcoin wallet provider over night."
see above^^^ this would make reddit a behemoth. 
EDIT: You know what, I'm gonna go full retard on this. Hear me out. 
Reddit has a real opportunity to buy/implement something like changetip while it's small, and instantly changetip would explode in usage. It has been said many times before by that they're not making an altcoin, my question is - what is the point of further obscuring the bitcoin name?? I mean, if it was "Reddit Notes: Powered by Bitcoin" maybe I wouldn't be so upset, but what can possibly be the benefit of trademarking the name 'Reddit Notes' and hiding the fact that it uses bitcoin? 
Reddit reaches millions of people, and rather than suddenly allowing them to access Bitcoin, they get 'Reddit Notes' - most users think this is some kind of point system like reddit gold. Perhaps that's why it seems this news is so underwhelming, normal users have no idea what a reddit note is or why they should care. It would be plastered all over the internet if reddit suddenly enabled bitcoin tipping across it's whole platform and gave every user a receive address or the ability to import a MPK from electrum to generate receive addresses when tips are collected by the user, but instead most normal non-crypto users are probably just scrolling right past the announcement. 
I just feel this is such a great opportunity for reddit to say "Bitcoin is changing the world, and hey - here's a new reddit enabled bitcoin wallet for you! Users can also tip you for your contributions! Enjoy! Read more here"
Instead they are saying "Here's some proprietary note system you can use but by the way it's obscure and complex and legal this and that..."
Also, the word notes? Really? "Notes"?? People will think it's for writing notes.... sigh...
Maybe I'm nuts, but everyone is so keen on trying to create a brand that simple things get left in the wayside...

@_date: 2015-01-06 07:58:37
using 2 old GPU's (r8 270x's) to mine alts and auto exchange for BTC still pays out - mining BTC directly would take months for a single satoshi but with clever auto switching pools, mining new coins at launch and merged mining you can get about 1-3 bucks a day after electricity costs, and mining 30-90 dollars a month in BTC is not too bad... 
but yea, mac mini - don't bother...

The sound simple process is to buy your bitcoin, and then throw them onto a 
You use an open source github package that opens as a website offline - password protect your new wallet - and then get a laser etched aluminium card you can store your BTC on indefinitely - because it's password protected you have no fears.
Way cheaper than a Trezor and it works better too (this coming from someone who has both and hates that Trezor is often down and funds are inaccessible in my device - which is just as bad as centralization)

Don't think for a second if they had actual evidence that he wouldn't be charged,  evidence = charges. The reason they dropped the charges is because they can't prove it obviously.

I'm not sure if you're being thick intentionally or just clueless.  In your world I guess bitcoin should be illegal because the blockchain doesn't have a money transmitters license. 
There are two types of bitcoiners, one that is afraid of everything they do because they live under the rule of banker corporate enforcers - and people that just don't give a fuck and have the technology to subvert the first. So meh. 
I would tip you so you are guilty of accepting funds illegally but I don't even think you're worth it.

Yes but that's the end game, reducing demand until it is effectively 0. People seem completely incredulous that the dollar is ever going to collapse, so there really is no incentive as price declines to build infrastructure, and less infrastructure means less adopters.

I look at it in ways like this:
Right now, Facebook uses 'likes' as it's primary rating system of content between users. And it's useless.. You know those "If we get 10,000 likes you can save a child in Africa" well in reality right now 'likes' don't do anything, nothing. 
But imagine if you could use changetip to assign a value to Facebook likes. Suddenly getting 10,000 likes means that $10,000 was raised,  crowdsourced instantly with no central authority - just using bitcoin tips and Facebook as the information medium. 
That's where the REAL power for world change is, and either we the people are going to use it to advantage, or companies will control the flow of our money for us and we're stuck with paypal.
I mean, seriously, think of the value of that. Someone posts a video of a person who was attacked or robbed, or in poor health, in shitty circumstance, (insert whatever ailment here). And in the comments people are literally flinging money at the poster to help remedy the situation, best of all no banks no fees.
It's a no brainer to me, when you say "My concern is that this sort of discussion will disappear in a world where tipping is at the forefront of everyone's mind."
People spam comments already, giving them incentivization to do so may encourage it. Don't want to participate, don't tip. No biggie.

In business, with people who are likely to disagree for the sake of it, sometimes you can't sell the product you want by pitching it. 
I wonder if Gavin pitched the 20MB so people would say "we don't want 20MB! We want an algorithm!!"
If he had said initially, "Hey guys I am gonna create a heuristic algo that scales over time based on x" - people would have said "We want a 20MB simple solution! Not your hair brained algo!"
Do you have a link to the previous article about his proposal for a scaled solution? The one from months ago?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:47:54

I got a Trezor and the first time I went to use it the damn thing was down - I had to wait almost a full day to send it BTC and that you have to use their interface makes it not near decentralized...

Is it working for Visa based TD debit cards? My problem is that I have a TD Bank Visa debit like this: 
The problem is that the card numer is 16 digits long, Interact Online usually supports 12 or 13 digits, which means that anyone with the new card can't do it (and they are phasing out the old)
Which bank would work best? is there a specific debit card you should use because I will go out and get one pronto if so!

Until there is any evidence that it facilitates child porn it should be removed. I know it's possible, but has there ever been any time where we have a known occurence of this happening? Nope. 
We might as well put "Bitcoin facilitates funding of missile guidance systems for targeting and killing American civilians" - I mean, sure it's possible - but it hasn't happened yet so why post it?

People who don't like the fluidity of language and want to lock it into confines are the enemy lol.
It's the same with people who don't want to let new slang words into the dictionary. IMO if people are saying it, it is language as it holds meaning, so it should be in the dictionary.

What if there was a way to split the mining pool and incentivize miners to attack spam? Hmmm... Maybe a way to incentivize spam so that the moment it hits the network miners attack the fuck out of those tx to get them back in order...
As in "network spam attack" so +1% for all miners clearing them for a limited time until gone.
That way the network flops between two modes, normal and a mode where miners can be rewarded to clear the mempool?

You know whether or not you've hit the limit because the limit is 3k/day per atm asking for phone  Depending on jurisdiction and so on...
So u get the user phone  txt then verification code and then u can deal w em.
It can be one person or many people when the machine has processed that much it is effectively out of service.
But machines like the skyhook if set up in smaller, off the radar places can be totally run offline. As in a person can buy btc on an exchange, transfer it out to a wallet and send it to the btm, then do as many transactions as is needed exceeding the amounts or restrictions, in some cases doing no kyc. So long as the cops or authorities or whatever don't actually walk in to the location and ask questions, you can pretty much fund it yourself if you have the btc (or a way to get it).
For the most part that is a btc vending machine, recives bitcoin, doles it out, gets refilled privately by owner - and owner gets bitcoin from somewhere else.
So yes, this is not an enterprise level thing, that is hooked up to an exchange and registered and so on, but it is one type of btm situation. 
Like you are automating the local vendor model.
Results may vary yadda yadda...

No, you provide a bitcoin public address and a bip38 private key, they don't need the password or the unencrypted private key.

Hey statoshi, good call - I forgot all about change addresses, hmm. 
So perhaps it would need to support a input box for return addresses.  
If I understand right, given that an address may have multiple inputs, even in the event of a change address - the user should still own all addresses sending funds, and those should all be valid return points, regardless of which is chosen to return funds. 
In other words, if it's a self hosted wallet it shouldn't be an issue, but if it is from a shared pool of funds or multisig it will be an issue. Am I right?
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:11:24
Cool, what did u change the passwords to?

As someone who is looking to try and get 50btc over the next year or so - how does it feel? Is 50btc enough? Are you going for 100?
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:23:43
There isn't an incentive.
If you donate, you will win if the timer runs out. Each time you donate, the timer restarts. 
If you donate and the timer goes to 12 minutes, at 11:59 I can donate, and now I'm the projected winner, IF the timer goes to 0 without any more donations that is. But then, at 7 minutes someone donated and I'm out, they now have 12 minutes to last. 
It's actually more incentive to donate right away so you don't need to wait for others to get closer and closer to winning.
@_date: 2015-09-11 00:33:04
this game is fucking great
@_date: 2015-04-23 23:32:17
Well this was my thinking, and why it's so interesting to try and come up with that would happen. I think I want to complete this just to see what it would become...
I like the idea of the rising cost for each round, but I also like the idea that all it takes to block someone from claiming the pot with a 1BTC (1 min window) donation is someone sending a few bits at the pot just to eat their coin and 'keep the ball up' another while... lol

lol 300 bits
@_date: 2015-04-04 06:25:43
Bitcoin can be sent for free too. Generally larger sums are sent for free and processed by miners just as fast.
For smaller amounts, it can take a day or two, sometimes longer but that's for amounts as small as percentages of a penny.
So Bitcoin can be free if needed and not priority.

@_date: 2015-04-23 23:43:31
Good point, I was thinking if something like nLocktime could be used for 3 blocks or something on the spend address.
In other words, users are free to donate and then double spend, at the end of the draw that may amount to a number of unconfirmed transactions, but maybe we can 'nLocktime' the address and auto-send once 3 blocks get confirmed. And of the money not double spent, 100% of the pot would go ahead, whatever that amount is once all confirms, to the user who won.

@_date: 2015-04-23 23:55:31
1) every time you donate it starts the pot again, so the incentive to wait until the very last second is a non issue, other than making sure it doesn't run out. 
2) I'd love to figure out a way to make it so that you get one shot at it, using Bitcoin technology I'm not sure I can without it's own chain,..
3) While I'm not trying to scam people, I am playing around in the space trying to develop some cool stuff, but you're right that without some 2.0 layer of blockchain tech, the centralized structure can only be validated through longevity I suppose...

This is great, while I like incentivizing an already fun game, it's just too cheap to make me want to really get in there and play. I would much rather play call of duty where I can earn/lose $.50-1.00 in bitcoin with each kill/death. Playing for 30min-1hr and being able to walk away with 50 bucks in BtC is where it's at. 
For games like Starcraft - I would love to see developers just build an automatic escrow system and wallet. Where each game players send to a QR on screen to gain access to the match, and at the end of the match the game just sends the btc out to the winners address the stored in their settings.
So simple, so powerful, legislators probably hate this idea though.

What is the lowest common denominator for variables that can identify you, right? I think your right that it is a good practise to limit liability of multiple accounts. But it shocks me that there is no way to do this with crypto (yet).
It makes me feel like until we can get this idea solved using a cryptographic tool, we will need to use some sort of centralization if we want this type of feature, and even then it's unreliable.
How can we ever tackle voting for instance?

What a fucktard drake is... Like I watched his new video and the man can't dance he looks fucking retarded.. Watch the video with no sound as an example.. If u saw this guy doing this on the street you'd think he had a condition... All you need to do is watch the first 30 seconds of the video to be like "what the fuck?"

You can minimize fire and floor risks with something like a CryptoCards.co wallet but paper wallets will do the trick if you have a fire/waterproof safe

First, create a secondary blockchain that stores the BIP38 for all physical bills issued. Then put the BIP38 pass phrase inside of a said ledger that is programmed to release the passwords when you "spend" the bill? It doesn't matter if the person moves the funds really, what's important is whether this bill's BIP38 has been retrieved.
In other words, no one has access to the private key and thus the bill is valid. When someone scans the BIP38 private key, the blockchain returns the BIP38 key to the user, asks if they want it to be spent, and marks the bill in the ledger as "retrieved=true". This Also triggers the status in the blockchain that this key cannot be retrieved again. Whether they move the funds is irrelevant, the bill has been "retrieved".
Therefore you are verifying not if the funds are there, but rather if the BIP38 key value has been returned and "deactivated this bill from circulation" and if it is - the bill is no longer safe (even when funded). 
But then you have an issuance problem, as when each piece of paper is retrieved, you need to print a new piece of paper corresponding to the new funds address, and that's the real problem; the psychical issuance.

just know that your balance will only be up to date to the blockchain that you have. So in other words, if you have no block source, it means that you only have as much of the transaction history as existed at the time you stopped running the client.
In other words, if your account is empty up to that point - you may have 0. BUT if you received a transaction after that point - because you don't have the blockchain downloaded your wallet will show 0.00 even though you have a transaction. 
So let it run and catch up if you have the time (you will need to specify a block source, or delete the block source folder to start again - keep the wallet.dat of course) you may still have bitcoins if someone sent em after the point you stopped your client.
Make sense?

Is there a simple way to understand this? ie. Raise rates = depression / QE4 = party continues all the way to QE50? I mean, can we just QE for the next 500 years with no downsides?

Is there no way to give an incentive to include more transactions up to the limit, for instance for a reward multiplier?
Ie. Transaction limit is 10mb so fit all u can in - 5-10mb is paid block reward *.01 additional 
That way miners fight to include as many as they can under the limit?
