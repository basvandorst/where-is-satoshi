keep it, we are touching floor, ppl who bought at 10k sold high to ppl like you, but dont worry, this is cyclic, you will be who bought at 19k and will sell at 30 (example)

How I got the money to buy btc haha I used to sell League of Legends skins
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:08:09
well, I had a server running win xp virtual machines with an instance of bot (lolbanditbot) which level up referred accounts to 10 lvl, then if you achieved 100 x 10lvl accounts referring to main account, the main account got 17k rp. So I used to sell adding the client to that account as a friend and past 2 weeks I sent the skins or runes or mystery chests. I sold 50% off legit price. Sometimes that was painful cuz the people were 13 years old... and imagine the headache 
ps: sorry for my english if no good, from Spain here. :D

Got selling League of Legends skins in 2013 :v
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:50:49
well, there happened a trouble, and was the fact of people that doesn't know how to choose the right bot.  There had two kinds: which played in real battle with other people (thats why you got angry seeing your mate feeding or in base) and the bots which played with another bots (don't annoying humans), all in try mode battles. That was the reason of Riot to delete the referral program rp rewards and therefore the skins selling, people couldn't play fair

yes, you just have to imagine that you spent it in a travel, money has gone forever... Buy in this way, investing and waiting, maybe you get a wealthy life ticket. And many people thinks it's bubble blah blah. This begins now, all of us are early users with balls to invest and bet for this. But early users of any kind of things are criticized, and that will always be the case.
