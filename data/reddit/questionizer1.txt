This is r/Bitcoin.  Not r/depressed

Trolling I see.

It's not ableism.  Bitcoin and depression go together like apples and bears.  One does not belong here, troll.

No idea what this means.  More nonsense. 




So is your epidermis. 


In a place where it doesn't belong and you know it doesn't belong. You're a troll. 


Even if it were empirically demonstrable it still wouldn't belong here.  Reporting you.

Thanks man!  You too.  Maybe we were separated at birth.

You are what you are.  If you don't like it then don't exhibit inappropriate behavior in a sub where it doesn't belong. 


Are you traumatized?  Wow.  Anyway, I was just offering guidance to a place you would be more comfortable.  You can say thank you now. 




That's the second time you took my insinuation in the most strictly literal sense. You knew what I meant.  This is typical troll behavior.  Being difficult just to evoke a reaction. 




I was referring to your type before you think comment.  I have no clue about ypur reproduction fitness nonsequitur.  I don't know how you would expect anyone to make sense of that on a sub about bitcoin. 


I'm starting to get a good hint ;) 


I'm glad I gave you a laugh.  Right now my family is laughing at you.  Thanks for that.

The fuck it is


You are presumptuous. I didn't accuse you of "being" depressed.  I insinuated that you were acting that way. 


I can say the same for you.  So far you haven't made any sense. 


I see you don't like what I have to say.  Well, that's your opinion. 


So that's why you're here then.  Plot revealed.  You are indeed a troll.  If you're not here to add constructive dialog to the topic of bitcoin there's no reason to believe otherwise.

Let's see which one of us gets banned ;)
