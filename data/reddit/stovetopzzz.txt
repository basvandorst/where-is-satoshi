“Now, the crypto wunderkind says he wants to help engineer a platform for investing in cryptocurrencies that is easy for average folks to use.”
Believe that’s Coinbase

With the crazy downward roller coaster we're all currently on....this makes me happy : )
Also...as with all roller coasters the drop leads to a bigger up...with a couple loops thrown in as well.

I sure could use help with student loans ; )
In all seriousness...some inner cities boys/girls clubs that offer the extracurricular activities lots of schools are cutting out or don’t have money for is a good idea. 
Philadelphia is where I live and see the impact these programs have. These kids already grow up under degenerate role models sometimes and if no good examples are given they just build the case of the cyclical system. 
Do no donate to any foreign whatever...keep that money here and helping people...here. 
Edit: respect on getting in the early crypto game.
