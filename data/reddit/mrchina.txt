We just need a bitcoin tech who also understands global marketing. I believe someone is ready to do it... but he is obviously too busy now. :)
@_date: 2015-06-29 03:50:45
I think Bitcoin is at least better than the original currency Greece used before they adopted Euro :)
@_date: 2015-06-27 07:08:25
Music players seem to be more open to new things :)
@_date: 2015-06-13 04:33:14
How his files are double encrypted?
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:03:48
No, you're not the only one addicted to this digital currency. :)
@_date: 2015-06-22 04:24:22
If more merchants accept Bitcoin payments and offer some discounts, more customers will try to use it. :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 05:35:21
Spent around 1btc on digital items.
@_date: 2015-06-14 09:32:10
Not very precise but I guess I can roughly understand your meaning :)
@_date: 2015-06-28 05:36:24
Who said Bitcoin can't scale?
@_date: 2015-06-15 09:11:55
For merchants, accepting Bitcoin payments can reduce their setup costs and avoid possible chargebacks. It is particularly good for small startups or small online stores.
@_date: 2015-06-03 04:41:02
I used it before for mining. The service worked for me. 
I don't trade coins there, though.
@_date: 2015-06-24 03:39:34
Nice idea, but I'm afraid people may try to use it to double spend. :)
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:29:41
What a Greece crisis... can't predict what will happen next.
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:55:14
Nice idea. This will be something great :)
@_date: 2015-06-25 02:45:11
More nodes = more decentralized network
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:21:10
I think testnet is good for testing if code changes are correct or not. As long as the code is correct, there is not much meaningful to run high-volume stress test there.
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:43:02
This is obviously a scam. Did you check the address to see if someone really sent any coins?
@_date: 2015-06-18 03:57:35
Perhaps you should better focus on the blockchain technology. :)
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:59:31
You can build your own Bitcoin fork on a new blockchain at night and run it without the sun :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:10:08
Glad to know you've found it and reported to Google.
It may still take time for Google to read your report and take it down. Perhaps you could also report to blockchain.info and let them deal with it :)
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:56:18
Good method! I'll definitely try it later. Thanks and merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:58:10
Good news to all people in Taiwan. Congrats and merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-11-23 06:25:47
Needless to say, your wife and your sister are just awesome :)
@_date: 2014-12-18 08:04:04
I like opensource. Thanks for your efforts.
@_date: 2014-11-22 13:25:45
Wow can't believe I'm thinking the same as yours especially for the hilarious twitter profile pic :)
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:39:43
Thank you and Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2015-05-11 08:26:25
I think I'll run it for long and won't stop at least in the next couple of years.
@_date: 2014-11-22 13:14:41
Glad to see one more full node anyway. Keep on your good work!
@_date: 2015-05-03 09:32:44
Instead of Electrum, you may also try Multibit if you want desktop wallet.
@_date: 2015-05-18 02:57:29
So the total valuation of the world wide web is now 235 × 21 ÷ 3 = 1645...... BUY WWW NOW!
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:53:09
A step closer to mass adoption. :)
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:46:29
Cool price! Happy prizza day. :)
@_date: 2014-11-22 12:50:32
Can you firstly tell me what you're thinking so that I can know if I'm thinking the same?  :)
@_date: 2014-12-25 06:52:43
Merry Christmas and glad to have quality person like you to come to this sub!
@_date: 2015-05-07 10:26:59
Even from your data mentioned, it has just not hit 1MB now but it did grow rapidly in the past.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:00:17
A government can only limit some uses of Bitcoin, but can't stop it totally.
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:00:39
It may help if someone gonna set up an exchange to allow direct trades of crude oil with Bitcoins. :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:33:44
Thank you AnalyzerX7. Well done!
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:39:10
So... lovely
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:35:58
Well... just don't be over-excited. Stay calmed :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 06:18:27
Price fell from $1200 mainly because China banned bitcoin.
BUT China keeps unbanning things that they previously banned.
So it's all up to you to buy (or not) if you believe China will unban bitcoin one day.
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:20:31
Well... look like you still have a good start and is welcomed by the community here. Nice.
@_date: 2015-01-01 02:29:06
Wish you guys all the best in 2015!
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:49:34
Wow so many similar threads today about this big news. Watching...
@_date: 2016-01-29 09:20:45
So coders who contributed less number of lines but helped the software alot should be respected less?
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:51:25
Still hoping that all people can get their money back...
@_date: 2015-05-10 08:51:02
No one pays you directly for running a node, but it doesn't mean you really get no benefit running it.
That's why still many people, including me, are running nodes for "free". I run it mainly because I want to keep the network run smoothly.
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:38:10
I heard that Bter was hacked some months ago...
@_date: 2015-05-13 10:21:23
You'll never know.
That's why I like to use Bitcoin which has a well-known total amount. :)
@_date: 2015-05-17 05:19:48
One day... Maybe... but it will take time.
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:41:56
I like your meme, and I like Tuesday too :)
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:15:28
Just copy the whole ./bitcoin folder to the new HDD.
No need to re-download all over again.
@_date: 2015-07-01 03:27:21
I'd like to see a price ticker there too :)
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:24:58
Fiat supplies are controlled by governments.
Bitcoin supply is fixed and not controlled by any government.
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:27:28
After reading your post, you seem to have some idea about this debate already and don't seem to be as lazy as I am :)
@_date: 2015-07-18 18:10:26
That is why so many people have left.
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:51:49
Bitcoin value is mostly derived from demand and supply. 
Sometimes the difficulty may affect the supply, but not the demand. And different miners have different mining costs. That's why you don't always see price drops when difficulty decreases.
@_date: 2015-07-02 03:35:53
Ask them to put a Bitcoin logo on their front page :)
@_date: 2015-07-07 05:17:53
So yes, thank you. We now know there is really a room for improvement now. :)
@_date: 2015-07-23 06:23:47
Coins will not be lost if you keep in cold storage, but their value (if you mean the price) will be another issue. :)
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:26:56
If so, people can't buy coffee with Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2015-04-16 04:51:36
If we are really due for a recession this year, I think the federal reserve will just print more money later, and not increase interest rates.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:55:37
Never used it before, but it looks good. :)
What's the minimum withdrawal amount?
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:22:40
Good. And I think I'd encrypt it too. :)
@_date: 2015-04-22 04:24:13
It lools incredible. :) Anyone can successfully clam his coins?
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:33:44
Your internet speed should be okay but start mining is not. Because you cannot earn from mining under the current Bitcoin price (unless you have free electricity).
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:08:39
If you encrypt your wallet, then the old wallet.dat can still work, but without passphrase. That just means that you can't use the new passphrase to decrypt your old wallet.dat.
I never used unicode characters, but I suppose they should work.
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:34:33
Thank you for arranging all these.
@_date: 2015-04-04 06:07:36
We all need to know the truth. And thank you for telling us the truth.
@_date: 2015-04-14 13:13:07


For me, I kept trading bitcoin frequently yesterday. As you said, we are in 2015 now. :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 15:55:06
Not even one but the rest all go away immediately
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:00:16
Stop this! You are too late to join GPU mining. With such a high mining difficulty, it will eventually burn your card if you still continue.
Mining Bitcoin is too difficult for any graphic card now.
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:42:23
Use multibit if you don't want to download the full blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:14:01
Is your exchange regulated by any official body?
@_date: 2015-02-07 15:32:00
Happy weekend!
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:27:56
You just made a new account to tell us something like this?
@_date: 2015-02-12 12:28:26
It does takes some time to download the full blockchain. Wish you enjoy the process. :)
For your question, the blockchain will keep growing as long as there are still miners there.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:09:20
Any customer protection organization locally at your area you may report to?
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:45:11
Very good article..... I'm impressed
@_date: 2015-02-07 04:17:24
Nice event. Hope all other cloud service providers will do similar thing too, and not only in Brazil :)
