Here is my response to your previous post you deleted.  
Nothing I've said is a lie.  Spin whatever you want big guy. Let me be clear. 
You posted a comment in an attempt to scare weak hands into selling their bitcoin. Whether or not you have that ability is irrelevant. I posted a link to a post you made in which you instruct people to "short the shit out of bitcoin" - you proceed to claim to not have a short position, so either a) you don't believe strongly in your own research and just babble bullshit, b) have a short position and got scared when the price rebounded so you decided to shit post. 
Spin it how you want. Intentions are clear. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:14:12
Than why don't you short it big guy?

Why don't you fill us with your wisdom? What use case does your favorite alt solve that bitcoin hasn't already solved? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:56:36
My initial claim stands. That you don't have the ability to tank price with shit posting doesn't negate the fact that it is your goal. You claim to have no shorts yet scream to high heavens for people to short bitcoin. You've been caught, live with it because there is no way to justify your shit posting. Peace. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:43:05
At least you can admit it's a shit post. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:52:22
Your intentions are clear and that's all that matters. You are shorting bitcoin and you need the price to go down in order to make your profits. Whether or not your shit posting can move the price is irrelevant. Exposing the intentions behind your shit posting is relevant. Good luck with that US Economy.  Bitcoin is a drop in the ocean compared to that. Might wanna catch up on latest shit posting tactics before you attempt to slay that beast.

Or maybe you are trying to scare people into selling so you don't get margin called on your "short the shit out of bitcoin" position [1]. You are here to create FUD in hopes to make money. Tell me, since you are such a smart guy why dont you go ahead and enlighten the rest of us by sharing your thoughts about whats wrong with bitcoin?

-What about the notion that faster TX times is not safe? 
-What is real privacy? I think real privacy is a subjective term. Your idea of real privacy probably differs from another's idea of real privacy.

If someone's driving a 400k RR he's probably got some security guards or something of the sort. Maybe maybe not. There have been no in person robberies that I know of or heard of, so as far as I'm concerned it's all possibities but not guarantees. You are more likely to get robbed or card skimmed at ATM's or other places we use cards. Sure it might happen, but we still use our atm cards. Sure you might get robbed because of a personalized bitcoin license plate but you can get robbed in lots of places.

Why not just pay people for writing articles? Traffic/views on articles can be easily manipulated.

Wrong actually. I support a few projects, and was actually an altcoin idiot for 3 years before I realized how unnecessary 99% of them are. Just because ethereum scam isn't on my shortlist of decent crypto projects doesn't make me a bitcoin maximilist. The only people who cry that are usually bitter folks who didn't get rich from bitcoin and believe that for some reason one of these other scam projects will take* them to the promise land of riches. Not happening. Take your scam and shove it up your pie hole.

Especially family. Take a look at famlies fighting over inheritance. These types of feuds get super heated. Family members never talking again, lying to one another, making claims that are untrue.

It depends on your definition of 'rich' which is clearly subjective. Tribalism? Lol I used to make the same bullshit statements.

The listings I see are specific. E.g. 'I charge a 10% markup based on bitstamp price'. You know for a fact this guy didn't do this? It's a case by case basis, so in some instances a fee is charged, and in those instances I'd say those are the people getting in trouble. 
Clearly he was making profits or else he wouldn't have continued doing it. It's a very gray area, if you wanna risk it be my guest but clearly the gov is attacking people for specific reasons. 
If you are a normal Joe selling your property it's one thing. If you are buying and selling bitcoin regularly you will probably be a target.  
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:45:38
He is arrested because he charges a fee for his bitcoin sales. People who are simply selling their bitcoin (usually lower than spot price) shouldn't be worried. If you are one of the people buying/selling and you charge a fee, it would be in your best interest to get 'licensed'.

I think ethereum is a scam, yes. The DAO rollback made it so. Not to mention there was a pre-sale for tokens. Everyone seems to forget the premine on eth but usually quick to point it out on other scams. Litecoin serves a purpose, testing new ideas. Is it a scam? probably not.  
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:39:34
Instamine is never a dead horse. If it happened it happened, simply claiming 'dead horse' doesn't negate that fact. And just because a bunch of new ico coins are premined to shit doesn't make it okay. 
DASH roadmaps come jam packed full of extravagant claims. 
Privatesend still sucks balls and you know it. Only reason it ever existed was because privacy was 'hot' at the time of implementation and the hardcore privacy centric darkcoin developer vertoe really pushed for it, Evan realized the level of hype something like this could bring to his project and thus, darksend was born. It's all written on the forums go read it for yourself. 
Instantsend, another gimmick that nobody uses. The fee is outrageous. Even if instantsend is great tech the dash team never gave two shits. Camosoul and solarminer attempted to show those guys how important it was but they had a different agenda which included sending  tungfa on all expenses paid trip from China to Florida and hiding it... and corroborating with business partners in scamming the budget system. 
Governance... that is a bold statement. I'd hardly call it that. More like a power grab by the dash elite. They don't exist? Conspiracy? I've experienced their bullshit first hand. 
Masternode payments. You got me there. I totally agree. Dash is ponzi. Early investors are getting rewarded as new investors come in. Rewards come in all shapes and sizes. Actual masternode rewards and increased value of token. I'm not a guy that missed the boat. I was there from just about the beginning. It took me three years to realize what I have now realized. Maybe you will too some day. Perhaps when the treasury department, the IRS, the SEC or the FBI raid those offices in Arizona. 
The scammers still work for dash. They didn't get the money and run. They stole it in plain sight and convinced the masternode morons it was okay. It's not okay. Yet you and every other idiot who has never said shit about it clearly thinks it is. 
I've been hearing the 'dash evolution is gonna be a game changer' song for almost 2 years now. Gimme a break. No one gives a shit except dash people. It's nothing more than another gimmick, 'ease of use' ... 'So easy your grandma can use it'... again, no one gives a shit.
Anyways keep up the good work buddy boy, how much you getting paid to be here Mr. dash nation crew member?

What's good about DASH?
I can tell you what's bad...  
Instantly mined.  
Scammers in charge stealing funds from 'budget' system. (See lamassu atm debacle).  
Unfinished road maps.  
Claims of being the PayPal of crypto, 'So easy my grandma can use it' - my grandma don't wanna use PayPal let alone crypto.  
Stopped work on anonymity features.  
I can go on and on but I'd like to hear your thoughts on why dash is ~good~ decent crypto.

I never said you couldn't. I was responding to someone making the claim that bitcoin fees were 100$. Congrats though, on those free banking services not everyone is as lucky as you. I'm forced to pay 8$ per month which at this point amounts to 128$. That is well beyond the fees I've paid to send bitcoin.

Eth blockchain bigger than bitcoin already. They best do something about their low fees or the bloat is gonna get out of hand.
