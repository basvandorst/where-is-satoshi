We would NOT have peace. Not by a long shot. We have peace now (relatively) because things are stable, and a system is established. Bring that down as fast as crypto can - that's what im afraid of.

I'm still not convinced he didn't make it. In regard to the skills portion, he said himself to AP he could have made it because it wasn't that hard, or something to those lines. Why would he say that?
I believe he is truly brilliant (he did obtain a visa because he worked for a military contractor) and is merely fearing for his life as the creator of Bitcoin because this is a government leak - essentially another Snowden - that he intentionally unleashed upon the world. Also explains why he won't touch the coins.

A few notes for the next iteration:
Have people enter the target BTC price to avoid bias
Demographic?  Or could that be VERY bad??
Geographic location?
How did you learn of Bitcoin?  Web, traditional media, friend, other?
Looks cool though,  just filled it out.

Nt to mention if (god forbid) you realize losses on your BTC investments, you can claim a capital loss and offset gains in say, that stock market thing that has gone up a bit in the past few years.

I disagree that of Bitcoin fails, all cryptocurrency is dead. I actually believe that Bitcoin will eventually (5+ years) be replaced by an improved crypto, or at the very least there will be blockchain derivatives that will fill roles that Bitcoin was not designed to do. SWIFT messaging is one.

Fair point, maybe it will change along with parts and progress of Bitcoin

Compare now (2014) and the last 10 years to world war 2, and I'd say we have come a long way. You can't compare violence over a 100 year period.

Investors coming in to buy a struggling company can be a good sign.  Google Knight Capital Group.

Great point on the media referring to it as a currency and not a technology. Every time I read someone said "it's not a currency because..." I cringe.

Second the clothes comment. At least look presentable.

Interesting point about visiting the Bitcoin "office". I did recognize that the infrastructure needed for these transactions does not exist today, but didn't think about visiting a physical location for the fiat-btc conversion.
The nice thing with this analysis is you can tailor it to your own assumptions. If you feel six hours is more accurate, multiply my valuation by 24 (6 hours x 4 fifteen minute blocks).
I would call out that IF folks are still using a physical office and relying too much on companies to provide the infrastructure, the savings beyond current money remittance options won't be as stark, and could slow adoption.

Possible yes, but they also make the point that increased regulation would have a cost for industry participants that would be passed on to the consumers - us.  
But the Coinbase CEO also said competition could compress the 1% margins they have now.  Really its anybody's guess.

Marc andreessen. He has too much to lose to let coinbase fail. He would reinvest 5 times over to not lose his credibility as "the VC who backed Bitcoin first"

Um yes. Very worried. Donating doge coin to the Jamaican bobsled team, while great, is slightly different than the central planning required by a real government.

In 1994, you couldn't buy a nuke with "information".You can with Bitcoin/currency/money. Anyone who isn't at least a bit concerned about Bitcoin funding terrorism is fooling themselves. I like Bitcoin, but I like being alive even more.

This. People saying you need cold storage will soon sound like those that hide cash under their mattress. 
At one point, banks were a scary thing too, but then someone came along with the right incentives to be honest and run a good business and people don't think twice now. We might not be there yet, but soon people will look back on the cold storage days as the Stone Age. 
I trust coinbase more than I trust my ability not to lose a USB drive. 
Also, for Bitcoin to really take to the masses, you think everyone will have the savvy to run cold storage?  Coinbase and cloud wallets are an integral piece of the puzzle.

Nothing specific, I'm looking more to be taught to fish, or where to fish, than to be fed. I believe the blockchain has countless implications in my field, so want to be a part of those changes and learn the things I will need to know.

Awesome, thanks for all the links. I have read satoshis paper and feel I have a good grasp of the general concepts described there. Thanks again, this will certainly keep me busy :)

I bought at about 800 but have been buying all the way down too. My spreadsheet says my avg price is roughly 580, so I don't feel too bad. Still buying. 
And I'm also putting every dime of my disposable income into BTC as well.

Nice to see people recognize legitimate arguments against Bitcoin. Clearly Cuban is not a believer, but I agree it's too early to prove out his arguments against it, or ours for it.

No one has made the connection between the new taxes and it's effects of volatility. capital gains and losses effectively mute some of the volatility for investors, and the taxes on miners do the same thing. From an investors perspective (mine), this is a win all around for BTC. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:34:44
Paying tax on Bitcoin makes complete sense. You would pay the same tax if, for example, you sold a share of stock every time you wanted to buy a coffee. It's EXACTLY THE SAME PEOPLE.  
Very soon wallets will simply build in tax reporting and will spit out one net tax number on January 1st. You will just plug it in to your tax return the same way you do capital gains on your stock account or interest on your bank account. 
The crazy anarchists in this sub are starting to piss me off. Get out of the way, progress is coming and you need to get off the train now.

Fair points.  In that particular quote, I am taking a conservative approach, basically saying noone wants to hold it and its purely a payment network.  At a a bare minimum, it will be held for the 15 minutes, and so you can get at a valuation with that assumption.  
Obviously it will be held by people for a variety of reasons (myself included), so this represents a conservative analysis.
Having worked for long enough in payments, do NOT underestimate the value of this thing as a payment network.  Im ready to bet my career on Bitcoin.

He is better at finding companies that will become the Visa of Bitcoin than simply buying up bitcoins.

Bitcoins value is derived from low cost transactions. Period. You and your buddies can pass around dollar bills without telling the government all you want. If you couldn't do it over long distances for almost free, it's a non-event.

It's distant history now, but when this us govt thing got started we DID want to contribute. I agree it's now too big to essentially be relevant now, but if it needs to happen again (us choosing a govt) how will it come together?
