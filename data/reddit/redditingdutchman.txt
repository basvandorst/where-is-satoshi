Things are getting a lot better these days between North and South Korea. (besides that NK would never nuke the south, as that doesn't make any sense).

Not entirely. Many, many South Koreans have bitcoin as a potential way to escape their shitty economic situation. Especially young people. The wages are low (especially when you consider 12 hour working days) compared to the living costs. Cost of housing is insane in Seoul for example. Plus that society still expect everyone to marry, and spend a lot of money on a wedding ceremony. This in combination with very technological society makes south-koreans go into bitcoin much more than other countries.

It might not be bitcoin, but some are actually worth quite a bit in raw materials. Of course, when you take these you're the biggest asshole in the world.

If you check the actual birthrates, they have been going down a lot the past 50 years. Almost all of Africa just to get 5 or 6 children, now it's just a small handful of countries. 
This is also because of spreading information about prevention (condoms and such) and better schooling. I would suggest he donates some money do organisations that work on this.

You probably earn more money spending the time searching for coins on the sidewalk.

The problem is that more money doesn't mean more progress after a certain point. People will just get more sloppy spending it. A bigger team also doesn't necessary mean more progress. The best way would be to ask what they need for their next goal, and give that and no more until they reached that goal.

Even so, pollution is a very real problem. And not all power is created in a clean way. Especially in China, where a lot of miners are located, are contributing even more to an already big smog and pollution problem.
