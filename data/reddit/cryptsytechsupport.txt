The ledger is based off of all transactions within the system, it is unalterable. Cryptsy tickets no longer carry attachments or screenshots, due to attempted viruses within attachments.

I can not help if you are unwilling to cooperate.

I will need your username, and the email associated with the account.

More importantly, why would people not come to us with questions about the legitimacy of these "offers"?

Please see the above link, it is your entire ledger.

I would love to do my job, but it requires me to type in your username or email associated with the account. You, not I, stand to lose coins as it were.

You were able to go negative due to heavy site delays in early December, due to a massive influx of users. On the fourteenth of December, Paul Vernon personally transferred 138.68041158 XPM into your account, thereby resolving your debt. Yes you went negative, however they were due to trading, so you overextended your XPM balance buying other coins. You lost no money in this process.

[Anyone who sees this will note that your running balance never touched 740. The negative balances were due to a massive influx of users in December when we did not have sufficient server capacity to handle all of the transactions.](

Without giving too much information out. I am assuming that you are Frank?
