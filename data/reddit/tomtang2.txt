You're totally right, it's not systemically p2p like bitcoin.  It's p2p in that anyone can buy or sell from anyone else.

Right now browsing depend on having a location.  I understand that privacy is a concern so I'm working as quickly as possible to allow browsing the site without giving up your location.
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:51:47
That's an interesting idea. Could work if it catches on. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:10:17
I like it.  Thanks spottedmarkley!
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:53:59
Yeah, that's probably it.  It's a location based service so we ask your browser for your location.  I'll work on implementing a way for people to use the site without giving up their location so it's less invasive.

I left a corporate job in Architecture (designing skyscrapers in Singapore) to start a local marketplace for bitcoin.  I have a computer science undergrad, but it's been more than 10 years since I've written code and it took a while to get back into it.  I started mining and met a couple of great friends through bitcoin who all want to change the world.  I've never met a more ambitious, risk-taking, and optimistic group of people than bitcoiners and I'm proud to count myself among the ranks.  Once I made the jump, I've never looked back and everyday I'm still amazed that I've been able to survive for this long without a corporate job.

It's so important that we find ways to use bitcoin on a day to day basis.
@_date: 2014-06-15 01:52:16
You can try Corkket.com. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:48:42
Actually, I think oauth through coinbase can change all of that, it's not about the browser, it's integration with a wallet service.
@_date: 2014-11-21 15:16:21
Here's a direct link that will allow you to check out the site and browse without having to sign up:

You guys should try selling on Corkket.com, it's made for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:59:49
Just checking to see how it works, I got this as a tip earlier today, thought I'd pass it on.  Who knows, might be worth millions someday.  Millions!
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:34:00
This is why it's so important to get merchants to accept bitcoin and built up an ecosystem, otherwise the banks are still the gatekeepers.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:20:38
Good point.  We make an assumption that when there's no bank info or btc address, the default payment is USD.  If the btc address is filled in without any bank info, it will only allow payment in BTC and I have just updated it to reflect that.
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:43:26
Is there a symbol yet for the bit or a satoshi?

Hey guys, not sure if you know about us, we've been around for a few months now, would be happy to work together.  I think we all believe we need a bitcoin marketplace and none has really survived that long.  We've got some great bitcoin partners and advisors and we're growing fast.  I'm the founder and CEO so feel free to message me, would be great to get really motivated bitcoin programmers on board.  I think we all want a great service for bitcoin, no reason why we shouldn't work together.
Check us out.  
EDIT: here's a piece coindesk did on us a while back:
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:52:56
You can try  it's a better craigslist that processes payment in USD and Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:36:43
I think this is the Thai baht: ฿
@_date: 2014-09-11 15:21:06
Because we should always invest based on what our dreams tell us...
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:29:17
I recently went to China, almost everyone I talked to knows Bitcoin.  But in their mind, bitcoin has already passed it's peak.  They viewed it as a fad, a get rich in a few months scheme that has already been played out.  Very few people understood the technology or the potential to disrupt financial systems.
VCs invest in bitcoin not for getting millions in months, but billions in a decade.  That kind of long-term commitment allows for infrastructure to exist and grow.  And in bitcoin, commitment is key.  It's a commitment to a different kind of future.
Without the commitment it's just a flash in the pan, quickly forgotten with a group of winners and a group of losers in a zero sum game.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:14:00
Thanks!  Confirmed, 2000 bits tip feels good. =)
Did not know about bits already referring to money.  Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:32:54
this.  Even people that believe it will rise don't want to risk their money.  (or they're not interested in investments)
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:05:48
What about having ƀ for bits and Ƀ for bitcoin?  I someone suggested this a while ago, couldn't find the link.
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:43:06
Sorry, my fault, I saw a 50k day limit, never tested it out.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:01:46
I don't know what that means, but this is the most interesting comment here.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:25:10
You're right, it is quite high.  We've readjusted the USD fee to 5% (credit card charges are 3% by itself) and BTC fee is down to 2%.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:40:16
The best use of bitcoin at the moment is to hold onto it and hedge against the dollar.  Later on you can convert it into altcoin stocks and invest in companies you like.
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:48:38
This is true, getting a vendor to adopt bitcoin won't encourage people to buy it.  If I told my mom that walgreens accepts bitcoin (even with a 5%) discount, she might just say, "Great, but my credit card works just fine".
@_date: 2014-07-22 20:50:07
@_date: 2014-01-03 00:54:37
It's done.  You can now use the site without giving up your location.
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:40:02
Hey guys, founder of Corkket here.  We came to this realization that a local peer to peer marketplace using bitcoin would be hugely beneficial to bitcoin.  But we realized that the peer to peer aspect has high potential for fraud.  Using craigslist doesn't cut it, there needs to be an escrow system to protect both buyer and seller.  So we've implemented an escrow system in usd and btc and people can buy using both currencies. We currently have thousands of users, check us out at 
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:11:50
By the way, there's a website you can use now to sell stuff for bitcoin, try Corkket.com.
@_date: 2014-06-19 00:30:27
I think the distinction between using a satoshi vs bit is not a great one. But I think most people are slightly more comfortable with bits as the primary unit since it's not as extreme but still serves the same purpose.

Don't know why you got downvoted, price is absolutely key and indicates the market cap.  It's simple supply and demand.  All the people who want to talk about merchant adoption can but ultimately, I'm not going to buy bitcoin because I want to use it to buy stuff on overstock, I'd rather just use my credit card.  
Disclaimer: price is volatile and a drop of 20% doesn't mean bitcoin sucks, but price on orders of magnitude matter a lot.
@_date: 2014-06-19 00:27:41
Haha. Yes. The bitcoin counter-culture movement.

A lot of people have commented that you can't just browse the site without location.  The location is pretty integral to how the site works.  We're giving results closest to you first.  This isn't quite like ebay, craigslist, or amazon, it's an online corner market to buy and sell to people closest to you.  
We would like to have as many people use the site as possible and we don't want to exclude anyone who values their privacy so we're working on a way for anyone to look at what's on the site without giving up their location but a lot of the functions of the site depend on entering a location or address.
This site has been live for only 4 hours and the response has been great so far.   Thanks to everyone on this thread, the comments so far have been incredibly helpful and I will try to get around to responding to all of them.  
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:45:38
This needs to be higher.  We pay for network security.  With the cost/benefit of mining difficulty and bitcoin price, the system is self-balancing and not wasteful.

The exact same thing happened to me with Bank of America
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:57:38
So is it more like a back-end system for them?  Suppose I have bitcoins stored on coinbase and I want to send it to someone else, why wouldn't I just send it directly to them rather than going through paypal?  Is it more about the protection that paypal might have against scams?
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:34:27
You can sign up or sign in after clicking "Let's go!".  I also added a link to signup on the landing page so it's easier. =)
@_date: 2014-08-28 13:12:46
If this is your website, you should promote your top projects more and find ways to drive users to the site.  You should also hire a designer to make the site look and feel less like a weekend bootstrap project.  Looking like a startup is ok, but you should also look like you know what you're doing.
tldr; promote your best projects and hire a designer (or learn how to do it yourself)

In the meantime, you can try selling it on Corkket.
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:54:45
Corkket is a website I built for people to buy and sell things locally using bitcoin, so if you and your friends are selling stuff, it's a great place to list your stuff for sale.  We've had bitcoin miners, couches, coffeemakers and also BMWs and boats.  It's very locally-focused so we sort results closest first.  I'm coming up to Boston this weekend so message me if you and your friends have any questions or want to chat.
@_date: 2014-01-03 02:09:04
We wanted to show listings closest first and the only way to do that was to get location from the browser.  But it's updated now so anyone can browse without giving away location.
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:00:28

Why doesn't local bitcoins just put everything in escrow?  Funds are only released once buyer and seller have met the escrow amount.  That would make sense to me, then there's no need to trust anyone on the site.
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:17:22
Use openbazaar if you're looking for open-source.  There are a few marketplaces for bitcoin out there.  I would recommend taking a look at some of them.
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:17:06
Trading is an important part of the bitcoin economy, I'm referring to people who bought it hoping that it would quadruple their money in a few months.  The ones who are hoping to jump onboard before the next peak and then give up/sell when they see the price drop.
@_date: 2014-07-31 00:04:15
$3xx seems pretty improbable no?
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:58:02
This is the important question here.
@_date: 2014-08-28 16:24:37
USD is currently the global reserve currency and maintains its value as a result.  If it's no longer the global reserve currency, it's value would fluctuate and most likely drop relative to other currencies in order to have export competitiveness.  When that happens, Bitcoin price will rise relative to USD and more countries will be looking for an alternative.  This is a great opportunity for Bitcoin to step in and become the global reserve currency.  Probably a very long time-line before that happens 5~10 years.  But it's important to note that removing USD as a global reserve currency is something on the mind of mainstream media like NYtimes.

as suggested by onetfaitpouraimer, the data was taken from a bitcointalk thread by rpietila:
Which analyzed the Mt Gox leak so it more accurately represents owners, not wallets or addresses.
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:27:40
That's exactly right.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:47:16
When you can buy anything online using bitcoin, it'll definitely make things easier.  But I think having to open up their bitcoin wallet on a different tab and sending the address through with the correct amount still seems cumbersome, but a wallet built into your browser where you can just click 'pay' would make it much easier for people.
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:19:33
For sure, charge-backs are a huge issue.  There are tons of bitcoin-based marketplaces to try out:
