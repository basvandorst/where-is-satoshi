Why the obvious lies?
BCH highest price in October: $460.
BCH crosses $2400 on December 19th (x5.2 from October high).
BCH ATH on December 20th: $4355 (x9.5 from October high).
BCH price today: $2500 (x5.4 from October high).
BTC highest price in October: $6200.
BTC price on December 19th: $19 000 (x3.0 from October high)
BTC ATH on December 17th: $20100 (x3.2 from October high).
BTC price today: $13400 (x2.2 from October high).
Something like Verge going x30 in 10 days is an outlier, not the norm.

Maybe he forgot his keys?
That would also explain why he remains anonymous, that would be the most embarrassing thing to admit, ever.

Meh, in the real world, karma is agreement, congratulations and strengthening relationships, they're arguably a stronger incentive to be conciliatory than karma is...

Oops, you're right, I took the maximum distance.

Depends on the butt, too.

How do you write dates again?

It's a human trait, really. With very few exceptions, we'll gravitate towards groups and opinions that comfort our own rather than confront them. It's not just "the Reddit Circlejerk", it's "the human circlejerk"!

Really though, who?

I'll play devil's advocate here and say that no matter how smart and educated someone is, seemingly stupid mistakes like this still happen. Plus, for all we know, OP may not be a native English speaker. As a non-native anglophone myself, I'm sure I sometimes misuse expressions that way.
Anyway, there are good reasons to be skeptical of this post, but I don't think this is one of them.

Bear: someone who believe Bitcoin will lose value at some point in the future (in trading, people who think a stock will go down are described as "bearish" or "bears" while those who think it will go up are "bullish" or "bulls").
Whale: someone who has a huge amount of Bitcoin (a whale is big, no profound meaning there).

Come on, Bitcoin is a currency of the world, use metric :)
$405,696 per coin.

It's fixed, thanks John!
For future reference, is there anything I can do on my end to avoid this situation, or was it simply an internal error on your side?
@_date: 2016-03-30 06:33:23
I did not complain, I mostly posted here to see if anyone understood what had happened. For all I knew, that hold was normal, I just couldn't really see why.
That fact that someone at coinbase saw it and fixed it within the hour is just a bonus.
@_date: 2016-03-29 18:28:25
Yeah, while I'm glad this was fixed really quickly after I posted here, it does seem to encourage "bad" behavior from customers if posting on Reddit accelerates support addressing your tickets.
But, just to play coinbase-advocate: I did submit it on Easter, and another support representative did answer the ticket right before John, so maybe 2-day turnaround time is to be expected.

I think the nature of one's promises is a very important factor in deciding whether following through on them is admirable.

Oh, sorry, I misunderstood your comment.
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:20:05
Your own "neutrality" is absolutely not evident in your post, so I just wanted to clearly highlight that both sides (or at the very least, people pretending to be on either side) are equally guilty of what you attributed to big-blockers.
If you're not taking sides in the debate and just want unproductive posts to stop, good, but that's not what I got from your post, that's for sure.
@_date: 2016-12-07 01:57:43
It's funny, but the first post your title made me think of is [this one]( from 4 days ago.
Except the poster there is an innocent disingenuous "neutral" small-blocker. "Why do people care so much about blocksize limit?", asks a person who's been actively posting in for more than two years, and who jumps at the first chance they get to support luke-jr calling people who care about the blocksize limit "trolls", while ignoring a legitimate answer to their question.
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:17:47
It's right in the title, but here, let me emphasize:
"innocent disingenuous "neutral" **big-blocker** spam/troll attack"
A series of negatively-connotated with Big Blocker right in the middle, it's hard to engage more clearly than that.
Edit: failed formatting, fixed.

Not knowing what size business we're talking about here, $16,000 can _definitely_ sink a business.

Sweet, thanks for the replies everyone! Glad to see it's probably nothing to worry about. 
I also got the email from Coinbase saying it was an error.
