There is no such thing as a government imposed limit to how many encrypted files ms can have in a file system.   You're talking out of your ass.

What's wrong with them keeping them?  If they came directly from outputs known to be the stolen coins, what is the problem? They've achieved multiple things by doing it.  They have sent a message to criminals to think twice about blatantly using them.  They've helped cover the cost of possible repercussions for their action and now, the coins coming from them are "blessed".  So if someone trading on btc-e sends their coins to coinbase and they trace back to the *bad* outputs, coinbase won't care.

The point is that it's very existence is not clear to most everybody and that you still need to go put it together on your own and any hosted service that does it for you will likely be shutdown.
You can do the same thing with a variety of other services.

It's already base58..
@_date: 2015-03-27 04:56:21
Looks good to me.  But be careful because if you give it to with a Bitcoin loaded on it he'll think you're trying to punish him.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:48:02
So your shitty argument is don't tip anything but the local currency because it requires effort.  I bet you give shitty gifts, if at all.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:26:36
I'm sure it's temporary.  It sounds like they had to do it this way because the thieves where paying other BTC-E customers to move their coins.  Now stupid people won't get swept up in this mess too.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:55:59
If I wanted privacy, I wouldn't use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:13:32
I think you're right.
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:16:04
I know several pawn shops in my area that will buy btc like gold.  But they won't give you a fair value for either.  Pawn shops are a rip off.
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:11:17
They are required to keep customer records for I think 5 years so deleting your account wouldn't help you get rid of your info.
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:05:41
Tumblers only work when your tumbling with other coins.
@_date: 2015-03-20 05:32:53
People like this don't care who they empower as long as they themselves are empowered.  Fenton is ultimately someone else's tool.

Bid on the next US Marshals auction.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:31:52
I agree that it's not always clear, but in the case of evo, the outputs were well known to btc-e.  As time goes on, a big chunk of the blockchain should succumb to bigdata.  I will be very surprised if it doesn't.
  
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:52:18
So all the SR coins seized and sold by the US Marshals are now tainted?  I don't think so.  I expect my exchange to be reasonable, and they haven't given me any reason to doubt them.  As best we know, the coins from evo are direct to the exchange.  I would expect the same behavior from coinbase if I tried dumping evo coins right now.
@_date: 2015-03-21 06:00:16
You've already demonstrated your ignorance.  What more is there to say?  There isn't even a single "tumbler" with enough obfuscation let alone a million.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:30:24
I'd be perfectly fine if criminals stopped using bitcoin and started using monero.
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:39:12
It's weird that you think writing various parts of a file to different parts of a block and likely multiple blocks is a problem.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:03:46
My comment has filled you with hope. ;)
  


  
Because btc-e may appear to be attempting to regulate itself in the eyes of coinbase.  We have no idea what btc-e is planning to do with the coins, so we are both speculating.  
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:59:02
Why would I spend $150 for something I can run for free on the computers I already own?
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:31:46
It's not hard to download the client and double click the installer on every machine you own.  Most people have more hard drive space than they need too.  
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:38:04
Either way, the product you're pushing does nothing to solve the issues you've listed.  The fact is that people can contribute in the same way for free.
@_date: 2015-03-21 05:32:35
Be careful how much you lead yourself with your assumptions.  You may find yourself believing in god.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:36:56
I agree but btc-e does not fall into the realm of regulated exchanges.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:04:44
The evolution admin kind, apparently.
@_date: 2015-03-21 05:43:59
Sending the same coin to a million different addresses traces back to the same coin, regardless of how many times it is sent.  You need unique inputs to obfuscate that coin.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:59:26
We've got until after the halving is my bet.  The halving will force many hands and there will be an immense amount of fud leading up to it.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:17:10
Good for BTC-E, now thieves will think twice about using them to dump their stolen coins.
  
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:46:37
You're really reaching here.  Millions of people give gold as gifts and you still have to work to sell it.  Remember, it's the thought that counts.  You're over dramatizing the situation.  
Name one commodity that has the potential to change people's financial lives like Bitcoin over the next 10 years.  Your argument is akin to don't give stocks as gifts.  It comes with no financial cost to the recipient and if it lives up to its potential it can change their financial well being for the better.

You don't need a static IP to run a node and your product doesn't automagically give a route one.
  


  
Many home routers will work out of the box with no need to port forward and your product does not automagically enable port forwarding.
  


  
QoS is not needed as the overhead for a node is minimal, as in not even noticable and your product does not automagically configure QoS.
  


  
You don't need to be constantly connected to run a node, it helps but is not necessary.   Just being connected a few hours a day is enough to help and contribute and the more that do it the more it helps.  And it costs nothing to do it.  Many people leave systems on at home all the time anyway.
  


  
Updates to the bitcoin software aren't that regular and I'm not seeing where your poduct automagically updates itself.  If it did update itself, I don't think that is necessarily a good thing.

@_date: 2015-03-21 02:37:16
Then go to another exchange, it's a free market.  Just hope you don't end up buying coins there that another exchange refuses to accept.  By taking a stand, btc-e is actually doing you a favor.  You can rest assured you will end up with coins that no one will associate with criminal activity.
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:43:09
They can know they were sourced from known outputs and that is enough.
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:47:18
Maybe you can tell me what service was counting encrypted files and how it knew they were encrypted.
@_date: 2015-03-26 01:54:30
Where were you last year when their "German contingent" was pumping changetip and bashco was doing nothing? 
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:10:40
But can't prejudice be used against the sidechain transactions?  Seems like there would be room for that if it's not built into bitcoin.
  
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:04:32
So basically you have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:03:46
Once authorities figure out it is there they can then go find it and shut it down.  It really is a non-issue.
@_date: 2015-03-27 04:21:23
I see that you're trying to make a big deal out of something that isn't a big deal and trying to put rules on gift giving.  I guess you feel entitled to get what you want.  I'm guessing if you're my friend and I gave you some gold bullion you would be ungrateful.  You don't appear to be the type of person that I would consider to be a friend, let alone someone I would give any of my treasure to.  You're kind of an asshole based on my interactions with you.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:50:36
Sounds like they were trying to use btce to mix them, heh.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:58:45
I trust it.
@_date: 2015-03-28 15:33:38
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:01:30
LOL, so, um, CP for ants who know how to go put it back together!
Seriously though,  you're not getting CP into the blockchain in a way that really creates a problem and you would need to go put it all together on your own.  
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:33:25
Where did I say that?  Use them at your risk and understand the risks involved with your actions.
@_date: 2015-03-23 00:25:09
What if there is a fire?
@_date: 2015-03-21 06:04:03
Alright, I'm wrong, carry on..
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:36:29
I don't think you really know what you're talking about then.  The only reliable tumblers with a big enough ecosystem is the big exchanges.  The btc-e example today is a good example of that.
@_date: 2015-03-20 20:48:41
I can recall people telling me they wouldn't read the news online because they like holding a news paper.  I haven't heard that one in a long time.
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:03:20
Btce is anonymous and accountable to no one.
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:25:22
You are a desperate troll.
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:33:56
I agree with what you've said.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:16:54
It's not reasonable to assume it will happen in the first place.  You can tell if coins are mixed with themselves but with unique inputs they will be considered clean again.  Bitcoin would have no future and fail so no one is going to do it.
Btce not allowing themselves to be used is not the same as blacklisting.  It's reasonable to assume that they will reintroduce the coins to the ecosystem and that they just took a stand against criminals blatantly using them.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:28:09
It sounds like the thieves were trying to use BTC-E to tumble the stolen coins.  BTC-E said, NOPE!
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:34:01
Why do you expect that and why do you believe the majority would agree to it?
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:53:53
You're a naive fool if you think bitcoin will be anonymous forever.
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:31:28
You're right in that the market will help dictate the consequences.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:25:34
I dunno, it's not like they have to give a gift.  What happened to being thankful?  Why promote entitlement...
It does have value attached to it.  Should I also not give gold bullion as gifts??
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:04:37
In case you missed it, the context oh this whole thread is about coins generated from illegal activity sent to an exchange that apparently objected.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:29:40
Bitcoin has real value like gold has value.  I don't see a difference.  A timeshare has value too but comes with financial commitments and could be considered a white elephant.
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:15:25
That's a good question, I don't know.  Ask them.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:57:19
There isn't a system in place to confirm or facilitate that, but the evo addresses were well known.
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:04:27
I don't think you know what good money is.
@_date: 2015-03-27 21:12:57
It doesn't work like that.  You can't put "anything" on the blockchain.  You could link to it but that's not the same.
@_date: 2015-03-27 12:33:10
None.  Generate your own BIP38 wallet and make multiple copies.  Put the money you were going to spend into buying more btc.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:03:39
You would be correct if you could spend them equally.  There are things I can't buy and bills I can't pay with Bitcoin and that has nothing to do with my trust in it.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:34:40
I'm with you in this, this is contrived Buttcoin bullshit.  Nice troll OP.
