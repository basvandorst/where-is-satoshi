he also planned to raise the block limit indefinitely

sustainable at what block size? 1MB? 2MB? 1GB sure, for now
2MB is totally sustainable though
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:30:08
it would fill up eventually, bit that eventually will be closer to or even after the lighting network is better adopted
bitcoin its long term sustainability by keeping fees high, tons of people who are brand new to crypto see bitcoin as obsolete tech since the fees are so high. good luck changing people's minds

No one ever needs Jamba juice. And ps4 prices are going to always go down if you wait longer, same with games - and this has nothing to do with bitcoin. People know if they wait a year after a game comes out it will be cheaper, but people still pay full price.
Your examples are kinda crap.
Also, it being bad when people spending less money on non essential things is not necessarily a bad thing, but a matter of opinion. Anti-consumerist and sustainability hawks would likely say it's a good thing people aren't driving demand for unsustainable consumer products. It totally could shrink the economy though.

For the games thing - it is already the world we live in. Games get less expensive as time goes on, so do consoles, so does every other piece of technology. People still buy new computers because they want them even though they know they will cost far less in 2 years. At the same time, not everyone buys games on day 1 at $60. I rarely pay more than $10 for a game; I know if I wait a year or two, Steam or whomever else will put it on super sale. People already live in your scary non consumptionist world.
I really disagree that killing non essential jobs is a definite bad thing; it is more of a grey area. I put it in the same category of unnecessary market inefficiency like car dealerships. Should everyone use spoons instead of shovels? Catering to market inefficiency is only a good thing if its your job that's on the line. For everyone else its bad. On that same note, inflation is bad for savers, good for people with debt. Inflation punishes people who spend less and rewards people that over spend. A deflationary currency is a bad thing for some people, but not all. 
Also, even though bitcoin is slightly deflationary, people have and still use it to transact. This whole "bitcoin will ruin the world because people will just hold bitcoin rather than spend them" is a falsehood imo. If no one ever spent their bitcoin, we'd still have never achieved a level of price discovery. The first person who bought two pizzas with 10k bitcoin probably knew it was deflationary, but they still bought the pizzas. People used to buy drugs off of silk road with bitcoin even though the drugs were unneeded and the currency they used was deflationary.
This whole deflationary currencies would ruin the economy is an often repeated scenario, but really, its only bad for people with debt (which I will concede is most people). Only a fool would take out debt in a deflationary currency. Its also foolish to leave a bunch of money in a savings account and have inflation eat away at it. 
Maybe there is room for both.
I also just disagree with absolutes.

its not safe at all if you put a very very low fee on the first transaction, then with the same private key, send all your money to a new address with a higher fee that will get confirmed in 1 block, your higher fee transaction will be confirmed prior to the low fee one and the low fee one will drop off as an invalid transaction 
the only way 0 conf works is if the blocks are literally never full and that's not a guarantee 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:41:32
0 conf wasn't and still isn't a safe thing to accept, even on bcash

Quick format just removes the ntfs file index basically. Full format goes over every sector to check if it's valid and may or may not write data.
I quick formatted a drive full or pictures and got it all back. The trick is to also not write anything once it's been formatted

Check the USB drive with a file recovery program. There is a chance you saved a non-encrypted wallet on the drive and later deleted or quick formatted the drive.

If it was windows and you didn't format your hard drive, you'll find your old AppData folder somewhere in your Windows.old folder in your C: drive.
