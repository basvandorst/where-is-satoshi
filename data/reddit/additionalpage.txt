Fair enough, but there is no use case for this OP_RETURN stuff. If it turns put that it doesn't add any value and people can hide illegal shit in there, it's probably just worth getting rid of it.
I still think BTC is great, but removing CP would definitely make it better, right?

This is pretty grim.
A) What the hell is wrong with people?
B) As described in the article, you can be charged with creation/distribution of this material just by mining the blocks.
The article is pretty vague on what was found, but why is this functionality even required in the first place?

Do you need the OP_RETURN data to have a complete block? I assume that you do, or you would get the wrong output.

With (1), you still have to get the pricing right amd the crypto world is terrible at that. A great many people will just invest and wait for it to go up because supply is limited or something, something *waves hands*.
A glorious example is that Dentacoin thing that ended up with a market cap greater than the US dental industry or something stupid.

Thanks for the replies guys.
Agree that it seems pretty superfluous to the core functionality (currency or SoV). Despite the calls of "FUD" this could have some real-life legal repercussions, especially if I put my tin hat on and assume that govt. would be looking for a reason to kill bitcoin.

Humans as a species are so bad at understanding statistical significance. Its genuinely mind-blowing to see the number of BIG business decisions thay are made on the back of bad stats.

Other people have said that you should treat it as an asset that started at $0, as Bitcoin didn't intrinsically lose any value (wheres as a share split would lose value on the original).
Other suggestions are that you treat it as income, which is pretty horrible from your PoV as a taxpayer if you recognise $1000s of dollars of income which then drops to $0 value if Bitcoin Cash fails.
Honestly there aren't any great analogies for this in the tax system.
You need a proper tax advisor for this though, don't take our word for it. The best they'll be able to do is to give you a view though, the IRS may decide on a different treatment and leave you liable.
