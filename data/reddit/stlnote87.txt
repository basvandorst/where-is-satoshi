You like a teacher grading papers or something? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:02:10
Cancelled my sell order for $6200 and bought at $7025 so..... yeah... fml but I’m a HODLER so that $825 ain’t gonna mean shit in the end 
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:34:53
God that’d be amazing!  I’d def have to snag a few more before the next big run! 
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:41:57

@_date: 2018-09-09 18:39:55
Yeah thanks Miss Frizzle it was an autocorrect I didn’t care to change 
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:05:45
Im no big wig in this crypto space by any means but I have a good amount of money in btc and a couple others and my plan has always been a minimum of 5 years HODL so I echo your sentiment 100% I was just wanting some more knowledge on the Bakkt subject that’s all! 
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:34:36
�� 
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:41:10
I’m down $25k but am just hodling cuz I know king btc will make it all better by 2020 ����
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:40:46
So everyone thinks just by having another platform to buy it the price is going to explode?  Makes no sense there’s plenty of ways to acquire it now? 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:36:19
I’m not saying now I’m saying why is everyone saying “just wait for Bakkt” talking about the price shooting up when it releases? 
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:51:23
Was just asking ppls opinion “bro”.  And no, not sure what getting “hands up’ed” means, sounds like something you and your boyfriend do after one too many wine coolers.  Your little comedy routine you just tied there didn’t really land.  Come back with some new material and we can try again. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:12:42
Right I was bout to say he must’ve died before last Thursday ��
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:33:06
I hear you bro I had buy orders set at $6500 and $6200 and cancelled them on Thursday and bought at $7025... lone behold later that night I look at the price is at $6345 then fast forward to yesterday at $6150 I was HEATED!  Then I realized I am HODLing for years and those hundreds of dollars will mean Fuck All in the end! 
@_date: 2018-08-31 10:59:56
Just listened to it straight thru and God Damn did he kill it!  Lyrically WRECKS all these awful young rappers and mumble rappers.  Eminem is the KING just as BTC is KING! 
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:17:38
Indeed I am but she knows nothing about Crypto so to her I was just throwing away $20k... then when she saw it was $20k/btc and I didn’t sell them all she was not happy all over again.  And now here we are at $6800 and she thinks the price is never going back up.  She shall see and she will be happy with my patience come 2020 and beyond 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:12:37
Oh without a doubt!  I’m just being a cheap ass bc I’ve put a pretty high dollar amount into crypto kind of aimlessly the past few years and while I can afford to lose it if it happens I’m trying to be a little more cautious now that I have a kid.  
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:12:01
Lol you’re all good I was just giving you shit!  Haha I have a grammar nazi cousin who will be right on your ass for any tiny mistake so I’m used to it ��
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:08:19
Not sure in 7 years anyone is gonna have forgotten what a dollar is?  Lol other than that I love it!  Maybe in 3025 the forgetting of the fiat part will make sense. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:19:22
Exactly,  that was a stupid ass commercial 
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:07:57
You ain’t lyin man.  My son is turning 2 in December and since he’s been born I swear time has gone into warp speed.  I’m only 31 but I’m feeling much older 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:08:17
I was just more curious honestly to know what others thought on the possibility of the price coming down to even sub $6k level before another massive bull run? 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:07:18
I could do that I’m just getting heat from the old lady lol but hell im $6500 deep I don’t think the other $300 is gonna break the bank 
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:08:10
I’ll also mention it was $20k I could afford to spend and it wouldn’t be a detrimental loss if all was lost.  None the less, I got sat down and talked to like a little kid who’d just broke Grandma’s prized vase ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:32:58
Very true.  Although I believe btc is without a doubt the future for currencies all over the world and thus only see its long term value as sky high instead of possibly the other way.  Just me tho and I’m nobody so who knows.  For my family’s sake I’m hoping it’s a half million/btc someday and we have zero worries.  
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:37:13
Not “a” rapper... “THE” mother fucking GOAT

Album is D O P E as all fuck too! 
@_date: 2018-08-27 01:07:34
The year has like 120 something days left?  Almost over? Especially with crypto volatility?  
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:09:20
I said $6800 support level.  As in, not falling below $6800........
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:39:40
If by moon you mean Hollywood movie set then yeah, we went there.... ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:13:00
Yeah it’s def an irritating feeling lol I just want a short fall down to $5500-6500 range so I can buy my damn coin and forget about it for the next 18 years ����
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:56:51
Yeah I haven’t even peeked into the tax world of crypto or my holding yet and don’t want to.  Makes me sick thinking about it ��
@_date: 2018-08-19 18:05:07
Bc he’s an arrogant fuck with nothing better to do. Or at least that what it seems like to me. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:02:37
Lol k douche I am trying to pay $6500 not asking for anything free here.  You are free to troll elsewhere 
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:49:05
Lol super true but I’m just being super anal about having a whole btc as opposed to a fraction of one even if it’s almost a whole one lol I’m weird ��
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:52:34
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:19:22
No actually all my other btc and altcoins were bought 2-3 years ago and have been held and rarely ever checked on.  I’m just trying to be a little more price conscience on this one.  I appreciate the kind words tho!  And good luck to you as well may we all be on the moon in our lambos sooner than later!  Although my moon will be a house in San Francisco and my lambo will be a Z06 Corvette ��
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:04:21
I was thinking the same thing but if I buy $6500 worth right now I’m only getting about 91% of a btc instead of a whole coin.  Seems silly I know but it will bug the shit out of me lol 
@_date: 2018-08-27 21:02:32
Put $20k into bitcoin a few years back and the wife was livid... fast forward to Christmas last yea and I’m a genius!  Fast forward to now and I’m back out on the couch.  She ain’t bout that HODL life ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:10:51
Problem is I’m so impulsive and end up trying to short and get my ass handed to me lol I’ve never really asked what others thought mainly bc everyone’s guess is pure speculation and you’re right the decision is ultimately up to me.  I think I’m gonna wait it out a couple of weeks and see if I can’t get a btc for $6k or maybe even less.  If not, I tried ��‍♂️��
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:26:06
Life’s great question that seems to have no answer.  I’ve placed and cancelled at least 15-20 limit and market orders before they could be executed the past week.  I don’t like this day trader type shit lol I’m a buy it and forget it type of person so trying to get a bargain isn’t my forte 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:07:27
I could also do that
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:22:18
If I knew that was a possibility I’d gladly wait.  Trouble is I’m not sure if its falling that low again? 
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:08:58
Good to know escape is possible if need be!  ��
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:30:29
I have about 50% In btc, 25% in other coins, 25% fiat 
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:27:09
I have a digital bitbox and it does the job quite nicely.
