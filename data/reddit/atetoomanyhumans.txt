I was told in 2017 (January) that bitcoin would most likely hit 2k by the end of the year. And I thought to myself, “Holy shit! $2000??? That’s like a 100% return on investment in 11 months! Now it’s been a little over a year and I’m pissed that it’s at $7,000 lol.

Okay so how would inflation disrupt that more than deflation? Deflation incentivizes saving and borrowing whereas inflation incentivizes spending and borrowing. Except for inflation makes people more wealthy and does not steal money from people.

Retard. I said GIVES ME with NO EFFORT on my part. If I worked at a company then I would be working for it and it wouldn’t be free. God kids these days are fucking stupid.
If I walk into a sandwich shop and the person who takes my order decides to comp my meal, that’s a FREE meal. I didn’t pay for it, I didn’t earn it, and I did not deserve it. 
If someone has an ad on Craigslist for an old TV and the price is $0.00, then that is a FREE TV.
Likewise, if someone had an ad on Craigslist for a $100 bill, but for the price of $0.00, that would be FREE money. 
If that all doesn’t make sense to you I cant help you. There’s only so much explaining one can give to someone who’s IQ is below 100.
Here’s the definition of free for ya bud:
1. without cost or payment.
"ladies were admitted free"
synonyms:	without charge, free of charge, for nothing; complimentary, gratis.”

Hey! Congrats, and you’re picking a great time to start! 
Go to coinbase.com and create an account. If you’re only buying $100-$800 ish, I would say you do not need an offline wallet, just use Coinbase to store your coins. 
Coinbase is the easiest to start for sure and is generally the most trusted. 
Buy with setting up your bank account as the fees are much less. 
Good luck!

Well, obviously there are exceptions (like your case) and good for you in your career. 
As a software engineer, I’m sure you can answer this. Which is more addicting? Movies or video games? Which do people mostly spend more money on? 
I have yet to see a case where someone spends thousands on movies, but video games that is a (semi) common occurrence. 
There are hobbies that help you grow as a human and hobbies that don’t. If you can honestly say you think that sitting in your dark basement drinking Mountain Dew staring at your WOW game for hours on end is a more wholesome hobby than like 90% of the other options out there then I don’t know what to say.
When it’s to the point of whining about how bitcoin mining has affected your gaming experience because GPUs are overpriced that’s where I personally think gaming has crossed from casual to unhealthy

Hard to take someone seriously when they say “this are the facts.” What are you, in middle school? 
And “practically” and actually are two different meanings. Practically instant and practically fee-less are not as good as absolutely instant and fee-less. Implementing Layer 2 and LN everywhere is a pain in the ass and hardly anyone is tech savvy enough or willing enough to do this. Is is not infinitely scalable and cannot handle the load of the whole world making transactions. 
It is an old model, it is outdated, it is borderline centralized at this point, and is easily manipulated, spammed, and attacked. 
Maybe you should do some real reading about bitcoin instead of your middle school headline reading and confirmation bias reading. Fucking moron

You’re just a bloody idiot. You can’t go randomly buying any coin hoping for success. If you buy “idiotxcoin” a coin which there are 7,976,976,986 total and the price is close to $5 you cannot hope for x19 gains. Not everyone knows that, which is why I told OP that. 
If you buy let’s make up a coin called idiotycoin where there is only 1,000,000 coins and they are priced at $.10 it will be easy for that coin’s value to rise quickly.  
Go the fuck home noob

You have to realize something okay? Get this one small piece of information through your enormously thick skull: he hasn’t lost any fucking money until he sells. 
If he sells now I’ll call him an idiot with you. If he is patient and sees that bitcoins value is beyond its price and then xmonths or xyears down the road he sells when bitcoin is at $30,000 you will look like a damn idiot and he will have made $20,000

Well, the original reason I got into crypto was as an investment with the primary purpose of getting money. As I joined reddit I realized how good crypto actually was and how it will be a part of the future which did help me stop being such a scaredy cat about the price.
But if it’s your primary reason for being in crypto I don’t think that’s inherently bad. People invest in a lot of things with the sole purpose of making money. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:35:44
Not me that’s for sure
@_date: 2018-06-02 13:09:45
It is easy to do.
Low market cap, low supply, and buy in a bull market.
Just as an experiment (I only used $100 because I HODL bitcoin as I just don’t want to get into the altgame do to laziness) during the December run, I put $100 into just that, low marketcap, low coin value, low supply and boom, 19x my investment. Absolute shitcoin but in 1 month it went from $.11 to $2.02. Made about $1,900.

You’re an actual retard. Buy low. That’s always the advice. I dont see it getting dramatically lower than this. Sure it could drop $1500 but A) I doubt it and B) it’s better buying now than if it jumps to 7k. 
Buying now is a great time

Besides the few cases what I originally said is true. If you said “no one wants to have sex with frogs,” I could go out and find the few cases where you’re wrong. In general video games are much more addictive.


Could not agree more. If you are set in life then go for it. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, my problem is that a lot of people who are poor and play video games keep themselves in perpetual poverty with “hobbies” instead of saving that money. But yes if you’re rich and have an income where you don’t have to worry about that, go for it.


And again, good for you, really. But how many people who play video games have the same story you do? MAYBE if we are being super generous .5%? 
 
There are a good 50%-60% of the males at my college who go straight from class to playing video games, or, sometimes if it’s a double XP weekend or a new DLC they skip class altogether. 
Source: I have been at college for 3 years and have had many roommates. I see the same 15% of the class missing classes over and over and hear what they talk about.
Now if you can tell me that skipping classes for video games is a good thing, then I don’t know what to think. It is such an unhealthy thing and I guarantee that the people with social anxiety would be a lot better off taking a walk, hitting the gym, or doing something else rather than sitting in their dorm all day playing fortnight. 


Yes, and maybe I came I’m too strong about video games because like you said, it’s not black and white. If you occasionally play with your friends or you are making a career out of it, I have no issue. But I still believe that a majority of people would be much better off if they cut that addiction altogether.

All you needed was one link to a website and you would immediately win this argument, but you cannot provide one (because you made your OC up) so instead you’re trying to steer the conversation away from your lies. 
You are a damn idiot, a waste of space, an utter and complete idiot, and an example of someone who has no intelligence at all so they lie to make it seem like they do have intelligence. 
By the way, please leave, leave everything. No one is better with you than without you.

Let me show you exhibit a: 
In this comment you made 23 days ago you mentioned your work. Congrats for being stupid.
Upon further reading it seems you are possibly a graphic designer with hopes to become a millionaire off of genesis. Unfortunately for you genesis had dropped more than half of its price since you bought in it looks like. LOL. 
You don’t even have a million dollars, pathetic.
Here ladies and gents we see a retard in his natural habitat. Observe how easily his stupidity is detected.

Who cares if people read them? The only thing that matters is that their inbox says 1,000,000 unread emails. 
I’m not saying it will make a huge difference, but it is definitely a very tiny tiny factor in their decision. Something is better than nothing. What would they think if 1 person left them an email as opposed to 1,000,000?

You’re missing the point. At their core, the only thing that gives both of these assets value is our belief. If you, me, and 10,000,000 others said to hell with USD, it would have no value to us. Same with btc.

HA! You complete moron how can you not see this.
Currently there are about 23mil addresses that own btc. 80% of btc has already been mined. There are 7.5 billion people in the world.
THIS means that .3% of the worlds population owns 80% of bitcoin!!! This gets even worse when you take into account that a ton of it has been lost forever and that this stat will only get worse as time goes on without people adopting btc. 
And if you dont know by now why btc is practically centralized then you will never know because you have a bias and you don’t want to see it.
I’m not sure if you’re aware of the terms PoW, voting power, or what controlling 51% of the voting power means but yeah there is a hint. 
For fucks sake, these are REAL problems facing bitcoin and you idiots have blinders on and can’t face reality.

I’m not saying it’s unavoidable. All governments print money. All I’m saying is it fucks us in the ass. The money I have is worth 2-3% less every year.

Person is weary of investing in crypto

——&gt;person seeing bull run, regrets not buying in
——&gt;crashes down to 1/8 of what person paid for

That is exactly what I am saying. 
The reason I commented it is because people like to act like crypto is a magic money that has absolutely zero real value. We point out that crypto has the same inherent value as fiat as both currencies are based on belief of value. That’s why we say that. 
And yes there is money that has value that isn’t just believed value: gold
