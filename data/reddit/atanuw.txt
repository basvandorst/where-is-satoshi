Both is happening. That's why the price is more or less stable.

Is it only me who believes that new coins are creating scams and dips to BTC or there are few people too who thinks the same?

It seems to be hovering around 14k as it has for about a week now. I don't see it going any lower aside from some minor movements here and there. I think this will be a good sign to investors to buy in for another pump in the coming month. I think you're right, 40k isn't out of the question or anything.

The key to judging the legitimacy of centralization is always the ability of users to opt out. Bitcoin provides this, while fiat and central banks do not.
That is the difference, and it is one that we've come to appreciate this.

Could they really talking about bitcoin? I think that would be great for Ebay.

If the bitcoin bubble bursts, then what will happen next?

Bitcoin is at unprecedented speed and can't be predicted as it shattered all records in a very small time.

If we look at the chart of the past three months or more, btc went up too fast and thus a correction was inevitable. We are still in the uptrend and when every altcoin is done pumping, btc will be next.

I think Roger Ver's interview is a biggest threat to the bitcoin public as a whole. 
 has brought many new faces to bitcoin and continues to so. So get the right person
