I hate to go against the grain here, but doesn't the US go after corruption pretty damn aggressively? I mean, look at the track record for the current US Attorney who was appointed by Obama, [Preet Bharara]( Not to mention [FIFA corruption]( being targeted by the FBI.

How was it proven that he was paying six figure amounts to have people killed?  
  
I had first heard that around the time that the DEA had lied during the trial about how they received access to the servers, when the tech community basically came out and said "that's a lie because that's not possible." After that I essentially felt that they would rack up charges against Ross because they *knew* he did it, and wanted him taken down, but also knew they were walking the fine like of criminal law where he might get off.  
  
I'm not trying to blindly defend Ross, but I did stop trusting the prosecution in this trial after that.  
  
I'm seeing some people below quoting Ross' journal about soliciting assassinations, but I'm not seeing it in the article linked...

There are two primary ways that news papers can exhibit bias - in their reporting and in their editorials. Obviously it's fairly easy to identify bias of the editorial staff in the op-ed section, but bias in reporting is a bit more insidious.  
  
Generally papers don't outright print falsehoods, and if they do, they correct them. They do, however, word headlines and content in ways that can have an entirely subconscious effect on the reader. A little understanding of [emotive conjugation]( can tell you how synonymous words can elicit entirely contrary responses in the reader. Another way papers exhibit bias in their reporting is in how and where in their paper they feature stories. This is generally less revealing, however, because at the end of the day the story that will sell will get prime real estate.  
  
The WaPo is by no means a bad paper, and it is one of the most important insights into US politics. Just know the biases - WaPo leans left in reporting and editorial, NYT leans further left in reporting and editorial, and the WSJ tends to lean left in reporting, but conservative in their editorials.

I do remember the friends that I grew up with that were in the military complaining quite a bit. He put American lives at risk, and the most popularized video that was passed around as evidence of overzealous American engagement, could be seen as not overzealous at all after looking with closer scrutiny.  
  
I do support the goal of bringing accountability through transparency to our government. Hell, I'm grateful for the leak exposing the Hillary campaign and the DNC. But I also understand the criticism of him doing so selectively, in the favor of a Russian kleptocrat.

He tried his hand at stand up. It was received poorly, audience nearly put his head on a pike.

At the end of the day, though, I suppose I care less about which crypto is the dominant one, and more about which is more useful for what people are trying to use it for. 
  
Long term I honestly don't have massive confidence in blockchain tech being used as a store of wealth, unfortunately, despite blockchain's truly remarkable concept and utility. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:28:10
I agree with your point, absolutely. And I'm not trying to say that brand recognition makes bitcoin bulletproof, or that competing cryptos can't compete, or that in a couple decade we will definitely still be talking about blockchain as it is today is even relevant.  
  
I have plenty of fears for bitcoin, and for blockchain tech, I simply would like to put forward the point that brand recognition has considerable value as far as mass-appeal is concerned, even if much of the PR for bitcoin is at times remarkably negative.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:09:21
Bitcoin still has brand recognition like nothing else on the market. That's not to be ignored, when you see an article in any money and investing MSN, they primarily refer to bitcoin. Though it is true alt-coins are beginning to get recognition as well, MSN coverage of cryptos *without* mentioning bitcoin is extremely rare. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:44:33
Certainly the association is bad to mixed at best, but the concept of there being no such thing as bad publicity applies a touch here.  
  
Every person that talks about something, even if what is said is negative, cause more people to know of said thing.

The amazing thing is, I bought back when it was around $900 back at the incredible bull market end of 2013. Peaked around $1250, then all of the drama with Mt. Gox and one of the darknet markets admins stealing everyones coins had it lulled between $150 and $350, with the occasional run at $550, over the next several years years.  
  
I bought at nearly the worst time just before the last crash, and were it to crash down to $1200 tomorrow, I'd *still* have gains just around 35%. That's fairly fine growth over 4 years, and that circumstance is quite frankly assuming some of the most unfortunate timing with my trading.  
  
There's also a bonus to this recent bullish trend: Security in knowing that bitcoin is able to reach fantastic highs once again after such traumatic events as mentioned above have happened.

The FBI has been caught lying in other matters of this case. I don't 100% trust them to be honest when it comes to the charges on soliciting assassination.
