All the good luck to your store. I have used btc to buy games and I miss those days.
In the old days, when people talk about adoption they are mostly refer to vendor acceptance. Now it's sadly becoming "institute investment" as the gauge of adoption. If you can't pay with things you call currency, it is indeed simply a ponzi scheme.

The truth is, whenever you see this meme appearing on reddit, you sell. The more frequent it appears, the more you sell. Then you profit from noobs.

In early days when I first joined the community, there was a saying about what to do after you have bought bitcoins. Basically it is "Hold and only spend". At first glance, this seemed contradictory to me. But with time I get the idea and it makes total sense. That's the way to help bitcoin grow.
Sadly, nowadays people are waiting for the main stream adoption, which equals to "institution pumping up" the price. In general , institution money are the smarter one, especially in the traditional market. Expecting to make money from theirs is a bit cute.
In hinder sight and look what happened in the end of the last year, bitcoin's network had huge problem and vendors that accepted bitcoin were also leaving in group. That should have got us worried when the network seemed not working well. But the "good" news was that the future markets were opening. If we had been sober, there were enough signs indicating bitcoin would suffer huge drop after the future market opening.
In short, we should focus on the definition of mainstream adoption which is having more places where you can spend bitcoin, instead of institution money pumping for us. It was very likely much of institution money has been in, they pumped prior the future market and had eaten those who had bought at the top.
And today, with much better fundamentals for bitcoin, the price is however dropping like no tomorrow. This is almost the opposite to what happened in the end of the last year. So better watch out.
For those who can make money in this volatile market, good for you. To the believers, "hold and spend". That's what I learned in the earlier days here. I'm saying it again to those who are new.

There is definitely smart money in this. And I think the price won't stop dropping when people are still talking about the bounce up. It will only bounce up when everyone think it is dead.

Whoever is laughing about the pizza buying guy doesn't even understand the philosophy of bitcoin.
How do you know he didn't buy another batch of bitcoins after buying the pizza? He was the guy who made bitcoin become valuable. I don't know why people make quick guess that the guy must be regreting so much that he "wasted" his bitcoins. No. if I were him I wouldn't regret about buying pizza with bitcoin, but maybe that I didn't buy more bitcoin after seeing that they were useful and valuable coz they could buy stuff.

Exactly. I learned just here in this sub about the philosophy of buying and spending years ago. Then last time I made a thread about promoting this lost philosophy of using bitcoin I was actually criticized. People say the right mindset is buy and hold only.
If you only buy and hold, bitcoin is useless and will never be adopted. If you can't understand this, you are really thinking it wrong...
Another funny thing that's been prevalent here is the "waiting for institution money to pump up the price so they can dump on the institutions' smart money". Seriously, institutions' money are smarter than yours. They will mostly dump on you in the end. So you need to wake up.

Thanks for the link. However how come ledger is said to not support segwit address while I am able to create SW wallet with ledger chrome app. There is actually an option to choose for legacy or SW wallet with ledger.
The content of the link is not up to date?

Thanks. I get your point.  
"Tech elites prefer software on their own hardware with careful methodology."
I wonder how to have "your own hardware".
Install opensource firmware on a Rapberry Pi to make it a secure hardware wallet possible?

If I remembered right, the address I was trying to send to did start with a 3...I'll pay more attention next time.

Yes, I meant trezor/ledger wallet with electrum. Thanks. I'll try and test an electrum wallet a bit first.

When people say previous BTC crash was caused by/related to BCH dump it wasn't convincing to me. But now you see the synced dump and pump, it looks highly likely related.

It is just sad that BTC price can be manipulated so easily.
Tell me this rally is not "created" by btc cash. This is so obvious they don't even care to hide.
