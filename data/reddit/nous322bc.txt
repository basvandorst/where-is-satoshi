That's a very interesting point you bring up. As the owner he is not a creditor. His stash would be divided between customers. Also, Gonzague Gay-Bouchery might have a substantial amount with MtGox. 
*EDIT: So I read through the first interview post-shutdown and hit on something interesting.*
[12:01] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; [02:00:59] &lt;JonWickedFire&gt; And whether or not you, like everyone else, have taken a personal hit and are in the same boat as they are in terms of taking a loss/hit from the recent events? &lt;- any BTC I own personally were on MtGox
[12:05] &lt;JonWickedFire&gt; Well, how much is unavail for you?
[12:06] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; I'm not even sure
[12:06] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; didn't check my wallet before pushing the site offline
Now this is intriguing. We know that the crisis draft leaked before this interview. That leaves open the possibility that it was not included. But it is strange that he would believe he might have some funds left. After all, MtGox lost **all** the bicoins.

According to ToS (terms of service) MtGox is not allowed to trade on their own exchange. But of course they abused that like crazy to keep this zombie exchange going. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:16:12
They have to do this as a preparation for april 15th. It gives those with foreign bank accounts the ability to keep deposits and withdrawals flowing in and out of the exchange. If they didn't do this the exchange would have to close down. So if this is not enough to keep liquidity going (which is sadly a very real scenario) all the exchanges will have to close.

@_date: 2014-06-13 19:44:52
Well the math is fine and dandy, but does not really address the core issue: 


The company behind ghash is also behind cex— which sells mining 'contracts' for substantially more than their rational price, they also sell mining asic parts at a huge multiple of their marginal cost. They roll the profits from doing this into buying their own equipment at cost.
Mix in a bit of miners who incorrectly believe that mining is a race and that the 'fastest' wins disproportional more, and the result is pretty ugly.

Well I would agree if the found bitcoins is actually considered MtGox assets. But this could easily be viewed as customer assets that do not belong to MtGox. If that is the case then it is not for MtGox to dispose of. In their ToS they state that they hold bitcoin on behalf of the customers. When I deposit coins to MtGox I am not thereby giving them ownership. 
It's no different from a stockbroker buying on behalf of his client. MtGox is literally a middleman or a strawman between buyers and sellers. It's just a platform that have no ownership interest invested in the assets deposited by their clients.
MtGox Terms of Service: 
6. It will hold all monetary sums and all Bitcoins deposited by each Member in its Account, in that Member's name as registered in their Account details, **and on such Member's behalf**.
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:30:43
That makes sense, I jumped to conclusion before thinking it through. Domestic and international users can't withdraw or deposit to the exchanges because they would have to do so through a chinese bank, and thats not allowed. So no money in or out. Except through vouchers.

Not sure what false news you are thinking about. News was banks are no longer allowed to do business with bitcoin exchanges. That was a rumour until it started happening. So guess its not really hysteria and panic. Markets always react by selling to confirmed bad news.

Well sure, arbitrage would make sense, but my financial situation is good as it is. I have no need to be greedy as mtgox has given me so much. Also, I don't deposit money anymore (not since 2011). Guess Im just a satisfied customer that don't like change lol.

There was an inhouse bot that was running on gox for months - most likely to keep the hotwallet from going empty.  
Most likely they bought on their own exchange to reduce total amount of btc held by users (and to refill hotwallet). This would also explain why the price dipped below $100 when the crisis draft leaked. Missing bitcoins could be explained by blaming hackers, but missing fiat was a bit trickier. So they dumped most of the coins bought by the bot to try to get most of the missing fiat back.

Learn to read, yet again. Bitcoin is not allowed to act as a monetary unit. It is also possible (though much more vague) to interpret this as bitcoin exchanges falling under the category of issuer.

I like your optimism, but you need to check if its on solid ground. Banks are still closing accounts making deposits and withdrawals impossible. That is happening and will continue. That the PBOC won't ban bitcoin is really not that big of a deal. They never were going to do that according to the 5th of december memo. If you cant find a solid and reasonable explanation for the pump to continue I would start shorting soon. Don't be the victim of a bulltrap.

This is a very good point and should be at the top. Actually I feel for the first time that I have a fairly good understanding of wth has been going on at gox. If this turns out to be true then the price of bitcoin is artificially inflated on a global scale as the other exchanges followed gox. Who knows what the current price of bitcoin should be if it were not for all this fraud.

@_date: 2014-04-16 14:23:40
There is a common misconception about the amount (of bitcoin) they owe creditors. The fact is that the creditors are MtGox customers. In the crisis leak it is clearly stated that **120k of those coins belong to MtGox**.  If one makes the assumption that creditors have priority then all of the 202k will be returned to the customers. We therefore have to subtract 120k from the 744k missing coins. That means we have about 624k coins missing. With 202k found a total of 422k coins are actually missing. This of course assumes that Mark Karpeles has no right to get a piece of the 'found' coins. It also assumes that coins will not be sold off to cover missing fiat. **Customers could ideally get back about 32% of their lost bitcoins.**

In this regard, the General Prosecutor of the Russian Federation, chaired by Chief of the supervision of the execution of federal law Anatoly Palamarchuk expert group meeting held at the Interagency Working Group on combating crimes in the sphere of the economy devoted to the use of the territory of the Russian anonymous payment systems and kriptovalyut.
The work of this group was attended by Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia Dmitry Skobelkin, heads of relevant departments of the Bank of Russia, as well as officials of the Russian FSB and the Russian Interior Ministry, central staff of the General Prosecutor of Russia.
In accordance with Art. 27 of the Federal Law "On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation", "the official currency (currency) of the Russian Federation is the ruble. Introduction on the territory of Russia and other monetary units issue money substitutes is prohibited. " Certain distribution received anonymous payment systems and kriptovalyuty, including the most famous of them - Bitcoin are money substitutes and can not be used by individuals and legal entities.
Moreover, the distinguishing feature Bitcoin as a virtual mutual funds for accumulation and lack of security is a real value. Its price is determined solely by speculative actions that entails a high risk of loss of value and as a consequence, the violation of the right to keep its citizens and organizations.
Please keep in mind that the owners kriptovalyut today denied in Russia and other states ability to protect its interests in court or administrative order.
Following the meeting, outlining specific joint actions of the Bank of Russia and law enforcement to prevent possible violations in the sphere of money circulation in Russia, a number of specific solutions aimed at preventing violations of property rights of citizens and organizations associated with the use kriptovalyut. Taking into account international experience identified further areas of work on the legal regulation of this sector.
Development of the situation and the implementation of the above activities will be discussed at the next meeting of the expert group.

This is from the coindesk article. Not exactly confident words, or just shrugging it off. ~~He seems to have accepted that the bank ban on bitcoin exchanges will happen and~~ he is currently focused on the more grave matter; will PBOC also ban exchanges.

I would support this (I lost too). Right now it is the only feasible way out of this. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 13:07:55
Right, so it's still a bit unclear, but most likely refering to GBL and monetary losses.
By the way, do you know what is likely to happen after Chinese New year? Are you expecting withdrawal issues to become worse in the coming months?
Also, if u know, Huobi has used a personal bank account to allow funding, but now allows funding through their business account which I thought was illegal? I mean, why would BTCChina not do the same if its allowed?
Appreciate anything you can shed some light on, Thanks! :)

This is the reason! People need to understand that a huge chunk of the bitcoin economy just suddenly vanished. That means demand goes down. The more pertinent question is why are we not going down instead of up. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:44:36
Well it would be logical to conclude that miners act as the issuer and thus illegal in Russia.  So both mining activity and currency use is illegal.

Seems like a natural consequence from the december warning to all financial institutions to stay away from btc related business. We all thought it was strange that they could circumvent the 3rd party ban by using their own bank account. Time will tell.

"As of 13:00 CEST 24/05/2014, Bitstamp held 183,497.40310794 BTC in their cold wallet." - Mike Hearn
So if they only have 134k left they have possibly lost quite a bit, or simply lost customers since May of last year. It will be interesting to follow this as it develops.
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:59:02
Why would consumers choose crypto over fiat? I have not yet seen a powerful and convincing list of reasons. Sure you could say lower fees (still gotta pay fees to get btc though) and privacy from payment companies. But are those reasons enough to sway the public away from fiat and towards crypto? I seriously doubt it. 
Would love to see a list of powerful arguments for stating the case of crypto usage from a consumer perspective.

Anyone else find this a bit strange? In the case of MtGox japanese police was involved and the case was handed over to the cyberpolice; So one would expect Stamp to involve Slovenian police, right? Perhaps I'm missing something. Also not mentioning who exactly are investigating is a bit odd.

I'm actually getting worried now, why on earth would they remove association with stamp unless they knew something the rest of us don't.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:17:33
Nobody "prints" BTC anywhere so the analogy is not valid. They would have to narrow it down in scope so to fit the law. The most natural pick would be the exchanges if mining is eliminated. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:29:35

how you figure? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:01:12
Right, that is not happening. Guess they equated bank ban as bitcoin ban. Not sure why anyone would make that mistake. But to explain todays pump it seems like a ton of people did.

If you take a look at how prices collapsed after MtGox and how weak the pumps have been ever since I would say it points to an opposite conclusion. Who knows where the price would be without Mark Karpeles acting like a central banker. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:14:16
My take on it is that he inflated the bid/ask side and manipulated the volume to give the impression that MtGox was still the market leader. That way users would continue to deposit money. He most likely lost the coins early on and ever since tried to hide that fact. He was pretty desperate, and now its time to pay. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:31:32
Do you think this could explain the april 2013 bubble? 
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:34:57
will trades that went on in the months or weeks before the collapse be still counted as valid? I guess I'm asking if only the amount of actual bitcoin sent to gox will be considered valid and whatever amount you might have gained or lost by trading is viewed as fictitious.

“The PBOC statement on Dec. 5 was somewhat vague and there is more clarity now,” Zennon Kapron, managing director of financial consultancy Kapronasia, said in an interview yesterday in Shanghai. “The way it’s reading now is that after the Chinese New Year, you won’t be able to get your money off the platforms.”

Zennon Kapron, a financial technology analyst and consultant whose company Kapronasia operates out of Shanghai, said as recently as three days ago one that of his friends had been able to fund a BTC China account through China Merchants Bank. The money arrived within a few hours.
Today, however, transactions resulted in errors and could not be completed.
-- So does anyone know if China Merchant Bank is currently working? Would give us some indication where all of this is heading.

Its under the category of being goxxed. Nobody gets money out, some do with small amounts in due time. Usually it takes months if not more. Not being a european country is most likely support being clueless. Anyway, you will not be getting your money for some time, sorry. Once u send it there it usually will be stuck for a long time. That is why the orderbook partially is just growing bigger and bigger. Easier to buy btc and send it to another exchange like bistamp and sell with a loss. Good luck though.
