I think that's a fair response. 
Certainly I'd have to agree that adoption is being hugely hampered by barriers to entry like difficulty in getting coin in the first place (why we are putting in place some medium term academic study into this very issue).
The other side of the coin (pardon the phrase) there though is there needs to be a mainstream desire - normally created by a need - to use bitcoin.  Given the price volatility it's a scary place for regular investors.  That volatility also presents some challenges to retailers which in turn makes currency a tricky utility of bitcoin for lay persons to get their head around.
And I guess all this is merely part of the regular technology adoption curve.  Hell I remember using twitter at the start and almost everyone I knew thought I was nuts.
Once the utility is understood by people they will come.

Hey.  Great to hear more works being done in this field.  At a first glance any of the questions proposed are far too broad - I'm doing my PhD (within domain of crypto) and any of those done "properly" is huge.
Also there are starting to be a number of published works worth a reading as a primer.  I won't list them here but a simple search in scholar.google.com (or whatever library tool you have access to) will show up a handful done in the last year or so.
Further it is properly worth fully understanding the foundation release by Nakamoto as bits of it are, IMO, misinterpreted by many.
Feel free to drop me a line if you want to bounce things around.  PM here or just look me up - I'm easy to find ;o)

 Really gonna hope that was an ironic post...

No worries dude.  Interesting space, interesting times.  Just shout if you want a chat.

Cool.  Again thanks

Perhaps.  I generally also ignore FUD - unless I'm expressly looking for it in the research (sometimes it's really useful data).
HONESTLY there is no FUD or hidden intent to label the community in this study.  It is funded by ESRC in the UK and is sanctioned through Security Lancaster at Lancaster University.  Far too much peer reviewing going on with outcomes for me to fudge anything as it's the basis of a PhD.
Have a go.  All responses help.

*End of week bump*   A few days in now and the responses are trickling in.  Please do take the survey.  It's only half an hour and gives us a great insight into Bitcoin use, news and technology understanding and where cryptocurrency might end up.
@_date: 2016-02-19 13:50:07
Thanks for that.  Always happy to have the conversations.
@_date: 2016-02-19 13:12:52
Indeed, hence why having a large enough sample from multiple sources helps to normalise out those.  That and I quite like those extreme cases as they often provide unique insight.
Do have a go at the study.  Accuracy isn't the name of the game here; it's more about starting to understand what is a very complex relationship between Bitcoin markets, news reporting and users.

Hi there.  First a huge thanks for taking the survey.  The results will indeed be published through a series of papers and finally in my thesis - it's a long year ahead.  I hope to be able to publish summary stats by the summer and will be certain to link to those papers and thesis once allowed.  Again thanks.
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:21:29
Totally hear you however this was a conscious decision as rewarding participation introduces a variable I can't control for.   Thanks
@_date: 2016-02-02 12:56:24
*BUMP* Thanks for those of you who have already offered help.  I need well over a hundred people in total so please do take the survey if you can spare half an hour AND care about Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-10 11:58:28
@_date: 2016-02-19 11:44:00
Indeed.  There are a great many other possible reasons why not also.
The study is (at the second part) specifically looking to those who do read news to ascertain a few (as yet undisclosed) things.
Thanks for taking the first part.  
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:20:16
Yeah that was my bad when posting the call.  The full survey does refer to bitcoin / Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-19 13:49:19
Ah right,  now I follow.  Indeed they can be BUT those article comments presented another variable we wanted to control.  We are looking for evaluations purely on the news content and where comments are viewable this does (as you've already admitted) skew the evaluation.
Good comment though.  So good in fact I might pinch it for another much shorter study later on to test another thought that has popped into my head ;o)
@_date: 2016-02-19 11:42:26
AND this is a huge part of my work.  Hence why I'm asking people LIKE YOU to get amongst it and take the study.
