Never too young to acquire knowledge on anything. Good for you for being interested in crypto currency. Make sure you put some money in savings, start a retirement plan soon than later and make sure if you do high risk investments like cryptos, don’t invest more than you are comfortable losing!

So I made it back into work and combed through a bunch of documents and ended up finding my password! All 3 Bitcoins were recovered. Huge relief. I still have no recollection of making the password. I ended up printing those paper wallets a couple weeks before I put the Bitcoin on them. When I printed them, I wasn’t sure that I was going to use them, I remember looking at other options as well. So by the time I transferred the Bitcoin to them I had forgotten that there was an encryption and password attached to it. Learned a good lesson and freaked out for a couple days for sure. 
I ended up reaching out to Dave at Walletrecoveryservices.com as was recommended to others in multiple forums I found during my recovery attempt. He was unable to recover them with his services, but the password hints I gave him weren’t anywhere close to the password that I had used.  He was very quick to respond and seemed professional with his communication with me. Hopefully nobody else needs to use his services, but I’d recommend reaching out to him as a last ditch effort.

I’m not buying it. Red flags. Sounds like you don’t need any help. Except maybe last November and December. You somehow make lots of money during the bear market but somehow some of your smallest gains are during the most explosive months at the end of last year

Thanks, I’ve been trying password variations. If I did a random string of words though, I don’t think I would ever remember them.

I would still recommend first starting a normal retirement account (401k or Roth IRA). Make sure you put some money into that with every paycheck. After you contribute to that, figure out an amount you can put into crypto (high risk, high reward investment). Put some into both with every paycheck.

$250, left handed

It also gives the$0 to$1 and  $1 to $10 increase the same dimension as the $1000 to $10000 and so on making the chart very innacurate. With that said I have high hopes for Bitcoin and cryptos still

Obviously nobody knows for sure but I get the sense that a lot of people think that the beginning of a bull run is near. There are a few good reasons to think so. We have had less volatility and sideways trading lately which has preceded runs in the past.   There have been some clearer regulations coming about recently. Companies are starting to figure out custody/storage of crypto’s. Some major players are opening up to trading of crypto’s; Fidelity, Bakkt on Dec. 12, Forbes started a crypto tracker the other day, etc.  and the  possibility of the SEC approving an ETF is more likely than ever lately....definitely a growing and maturing market.

Bad idea. Take a little from each paycheck and buy what you can afford. Track your purchases and sales and put money aside for taxes

You also said there are no drivers of growth when we are currently in the biggest growth period ever for crypto currencies and that growth is growing exponentially. Crypto companies aren’t able to keep up with the growth and hire enough people. At some point this won’t be an issue anymore and some of the other issues we currently see (scalability, storage, regulation, etc) will be solved as well.   Exciting times ahead

True, I can see your point there.  It’s definitely still much more difficult and cumbersome to deal with cryptos than fiat though so most people aren’t going to use them to buy things yet. I agree that if all is hodlers started to use our crypto as well as hold it would probably help speed up the adoption rate, but I think it’s going to be a long process that will continue us to pick up steam and speed up as improvements are made. I do think the hodlers have their place in the community to help keep the hype and development going

If you have an idea of what the password might be there’s a chance it can be recovered. Some services use software to try and solve it. Free if they don’t figure it out and something like 20% of your bitcoin if they do

I didn’t tell my wife for a while. She knew I invested x amount per paycheck towards something and never has had an interest in investing. I had to tell her during the big bull run. I started to feel like I was hiding money from her at that point. Now it’s mostly gone haha ��

I don’t think this would be an issue with reputable merchants. If in a normal fiat situation they would agree to give you a refund, I would assume they would just send the btc back to you minus the fees maybe

Nothing to claim of here in the U.S. Just make sure you have it all documented for if/when you do end up selling or trading for other cryptos 
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:18:17
Good question, I don’t have an answer for you but I’ve been wondering the same thing. Hopefully someone here can answer with some data to say one way or the other

One of the ETF applications was placed by the CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) in the U.S. This is a very reputable company/stock exchange. If approved they will be the ones buying and storing the Bitcoin.  Investors will buy shares of the ETF from them and will not have to worry about storing or handling the crypto currencies themselves.  Anyone currently investing knows that the difficulty of buying/storing/keeping your cryptos safe is a huge pain when compared to buying a traditional stock/ETF/Mutual fund.  ETF’s usually have an associated fee somewhere around 1% per year.  If or when ETF’s are approved, they should be a very safe option for buying cryptos and should bring a substantial increase of money into the market.

Yes, I tried with two different wallets and both said it was encrypted. It also starts with 6P which I have read is the start of BIP encrypted private keys
@_date: 2018-07-31 05:41:00
I thought that was possible but it wouldn’t let me leave it blank.  You had success without typing a password? What wallet did you use?

In the US the IRS hasn’t put anything in writing regarding this.  Every CPA I have talked to has advised to use the FIFO method because it is unclear. My CPA said that if In the future when they spell it out more clearly we can go back and do it as LIFO or 1031 exchanges if that’s how they spell it out.

You can gift her up to $15,000 a year legally. Anything above that would technically be illegal or taxable if you claimed it
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:37:12
In the U.S this is considered currency structuring and is illegal if it is found you are doing this to avoid paying taxes
