Sorry i'm quiet new to leverage trading, can you please explain what you mean when you say the liquidations are less? if someone uses 100x leverage and gets their 30 mil position liquidated, don't they still lose the levraged amount of 30 mil?
I also want to repeat the question asked earlier ITT, do these liquidations only include people who lost their entire positions or also people with stop losses, in which case does the 30 mil indicate the amount they lost or just the position without their (unknown) max loss percentage calculated in?
Sorry if these are stupid questions but I can't seem to find easy answers online
Edit: I guess my main question is: How much money did someone lose if like a  3 mil contract gets liquidated? 3 mil? do we not know because they could have had a 2% max loss set in place for example? ...

 These are from people who were leverage trading. Say you have 100 dollars to invest, the market can either go up or down. If you think it is going to go up you can long, if you think it is going down you can short. If you short you are basically lending bitcoin from, in this case, BitMex and selling it at the start of your bet. At the end of your bet you have to repay the same amount of bitcoin. So if the price went down, you can now buy it for a cheaper price and you keep the difference. The opposite happens when you long.
Leverage comes in when you want to up your rewards, but with that also comes higher risk. If you have your 100 dollars you would only be able to buy around 0.01 btc, however if you use 100x leverage you can lend an additional 9900 dollars worth of bitcoin from BitMex. If the price now increases one percent, you keep all the revenue from that 1 BTC position, meaning you make around 100 extra dollars, if the price were to drop 1 percent, you would lose 100 dollars, meaning your entire position got \*liquidated\*.
That's what happened here, people took on a bet, (at an unknown amount of leverage) that the price would rise, but it dropped and they lost everything they put in.
I heard somewhere the average leverage on BitMex is around 8x, so the actual losses were probably more like 20 million USD.

Hey quick related question, whenever a whale is moving like 100 million in bitcoin most people start commenting that a dump could be incoming, but some people start saying the whale is gonna pump it.  
I don't see how the movement of bitcoin could signal a bitcoin pump, since he is only able to sell his bitcoin, and therefore drive the price lower right?
Am I missing something here?

I like to imagine there's this one dude that just put in a 100x short order with all of his holdings, and now earned his money back 5 times and received a gambling addiction for life
