China is still what worries me the most. High influence on price + crappy politics... :( and trying to go "around" their regulation is what really going to piss their government off. I hope they won't overreact.

Buying at current price, eh?
Alternatively, throw away half of your dollars and keep the rest in a low yielding bond. You'll end up with more money.

The 0.036 dividend was from selling a lot of mining blades last week. Right now they're selling usb sticks wich are less profitable and most likely won't be included in the current dividend. What is more, there was a significant downtime, and drop of hashing power, when ASICMiner was switching to solo mining. I'm saying they're back to 0.01-0.012 dividends.

Dear God...!
After 20 years he could only remember that the price of Bitcoin in 2013 fluctuated around $100 and that in 2014 it finally broke the magic barrier of $250 which was set by last year's (and all-time) high! It had to be an important moment in the Bitcoin history.
what if it ~~was~~ will be me?!

They have no interest in controling 51% as it might just devaluate bitcoin and lower their gains.

If bitcoin realy kicks in and Satoshi remains anonymous than maybe one of the core developers?

Can someone tell me what is the bitcoin transactions daily limit asuming limited block capacity? 
According to the recent Forbes article it cannot hold as many transactions as credit cards do. Is this true?

DO NOT BUY. This is the worst possible moment. It is still to hot out there. Wait for 2 or 3 weeks (I'm serious) everything should be back on its track. 
Buying now is worse than gambling.

Poland 
Since the Polish currency (PLN, Polski Zloty) is the fifth in bitcoin trading volume I've decided to create our very own subreddit :)
Polish media have already noticed Bitcoins and there have been several interesting articles about it. I will be adding some interesting ones with the English translation. I hope that the Polish subreddit can be developed for the benefit of entire Bitcoin community.

The real problem is Israeli influence on the U.S. banking sector, and hence the U.S. financial sector. The easy way to a thousand enemies for a Bitcoin.
When Satoshi asked to avoid connections with Wikileaks he was absolutely right. Unfortunately, the same applies to Palestine today.

**The developers should change the defaul fee in Bitcoin-QT ASAP.**
Noobs dont know how to change it for themselves and they are the ones who are most affected by it (as they probably do not own a lot of coins). This is very bad for bitcoin.

Why do they call Satoshi a "pseudonymous hacker"?
OK, Bitcoin as a currency might be described as pseudonymous. But Satoshi??
I have a feeling that people just keep using this phrase because it makes them look smarter.

And how about:
**Market Depth: 400 BTC** (*down to 0.01 BTC/share*) 
What does it mean? 
- **a single sell transaction of 400 shares brings the price down 99,62%** (yes, no mistake here.)
There are 230 000 shares floating somewhere, and every single one of them can be paired with PT share on BTC TC. 400 shares are only 0,17% of total shares avaliable.
1% of extra gains from solo bitcoin mining and price goes up 20%.
I wonder how this "market" will react when the dividend received on Wednesday drops by 70% ... and it most likely will.

**Here is where we all got stuck**:
When you type in the date of "Pizzas getting jealous" in Chest 5, the 18 may 2010 is a wrong answear and gives you a wrong key part. This is a date when this guy posted his offer to pay for pizza, but received he actually got it 4 days later: 22 may 2010, and this is the correct answear.
Chest 6 is not an event on 18 july (Nelson Mandela Day) but another event on 22 july. Correct answear: Pi Approximation Day.
The correct private key:

I recently checked my old bitcoin wallet from early 2012. I had two transactions: I bought 175BTC when it was ~$6 and sold them later this year with barely a profit. This saddens me :( So I deleted the wallet. Now I just have to erease my memory.
Well at least I learned to trust my guts.

The price remains where the last transaction was made. But I think you're missing the point.

Yeah... In European Union everything over 10000 euros falls under *Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism* rules. It means that your bank is obligated to report the activity on your account to authorities. 
Cashing out 500btc (~62500 euros) won't be easy without anyone noticing. If you just want the cash there is an easy and cheap way especialy if you live in Poland (and judging from tax % you might). But you may encounter problems with spending this cash on a house anyway. 
If I were you, I''d wait till the price goes realy high and then launder it like a pro (company in tax haven etc.)

**Neo**: Whoa. Déjà vu. 
[*Everyone freezes right in their tracks*] 
**Trinity**: What did you just say? 
**Neo**: Nothing. Just had a little déjà vu. 
**Trinity**: What did you see? 
**Cypher**: What happened? 
**Neo**: A black cat went past us, and then another that looked just like it. 
**Trinity**: How much like it? Was it the same cat? 
**Neo**: It might have been. I'm not sure. 
**Morpheus**: Switch! Apoc! 
**Neo**: What is it? 
**Trinity**: A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.

Actually I disagree. As you may have noticed the price didn't go up for quite a while. I believe people who got recently verified on MtGox are now waiting for the weekend price drops. I think this time they might actually protect bitcoin from devaluating.
