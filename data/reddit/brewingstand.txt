you are arguing semantics.  This comment is pointless.

I feel like I've been saying this for a week (because I have).  This is just an example of a guy who wants his money back and isn't thinking objectively.  Bitfinex is scamming you.  That's right they're scamming you, anyone who supports this socialized repayment is either a) an actual moron, or b) someone who just wants to cut their losses.  I can sympathize with the latter, but anyone who can't admit it, is lying to themselves.  Zane hasn't said ANYTHING about actually  catching this guy, or I don't know, how Bitfinex actually lost 70 million dollars of your money.  How much money will Bitfinex put up (it'll be a very small number)?  
Bitfinex actually took your 70 million and even tricked the rest of you into covering it.  Incredible.

You must be new.  Look at what just came out.  Bitfinex 100% took the money and are going to get away with it.  There hasn't been a SINGLE hack on an exchange that wasn't an insider job.  This isn't Mr. Robot, people just don't steal 70 million dollars without having inside help.  Seriously, did you start trading crypto last week?
The fact that they aren't using any of their own money is hilarious.  At the end of the day, I don't care for people who choose to use fraudulent services, but the fact that anyone supports what Bitfinex does is just beyond me.

Yes the leap in logic you just took is incredible.  The point is that they're going to open the exchange without looking for the vulnerability or paying back their clients.  They haven't released any information about the hack.  They lost 70 million, and they have no info? Are you kidding me.  
I'm sure they're really hard at work looking for the thief, they have Jeff and Steve on it, but they're 50% sure it was a guy in the office.  How many hacks in recent memory were from people outside the organization?  IF you've been in crypto longer than 2 months you would know it was an inside job.

Someone please explain this to me.  Why would this be good news for anyone? Instead of trying to find out what happened (ie: an inside job), they're going to socialize the loss!? They haven't mentioned if the hack could happen again, or the infinitely more likely scenario that the "hacker" is about to get more money, but this time "legally" from all the suckers who lost money on bitfinex.  Who is going to keep on using a service that is essentially stealing from its clients without ANY repercussions.  Someone please explain this to me.

Jokes aside, we all got played by Bitfinex.  Anyone who uses that exchange after this is a moron.

Typical garbage.  How can something be a safe haven when the price can fluctuate by 10% at the drop of a hat.    Anyone who invests in crypto does so at their own risk.

You must be new to crypto. And a look at your profile tells me yes you are.
