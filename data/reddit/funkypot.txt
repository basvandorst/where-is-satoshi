Parallel construction
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:17:47
You have a point. There was definitely some shady shit that contributed to the initial takedown of the silk road though.

This is not a minecraft feature. Its a currency system in use on one server.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:21:29
Never use the same ADRESS twice, wallets are fine

It all depends. If people want to allow people with lower income to get internet for free, they can choose to do so. If they want to be selfish and only allow people who pay to get internet, they can do that also. (Things on Kickstarter don't just give out free stuff once they reach their goal. You still have to pay for the product.)

You can't leave the country without a passport, so in a way they are.

That site is terrible for mobile, at least on my s4

Profit doesn't come from nowhere. Value comes from supply and demand, and another useless altcoin is not going to be a proper incentive.
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:16:15
No. Bitcoin suffers from high volatility *and* it is deflationary. That does not automatically mean that one causes the other. Correlation != causation.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:15:05
You don't understand how torrenting works.
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:20:06
I stand corrected
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:44:14
Filthy casual... (kidding)
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:30:08
You're not actually backing up your argument. You're talking about how central banks/governments control inflation on where the main goal is to get rid of central  banks/governments BECAUSE of the forced inflation. Inflation is used to steal from everyone who uses the currency that is inflated. It is not a good thing.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:03:54
Is this just for this subreddit? Or all of reddit?
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:09:39
Nah man, what is this "money" you speak of?
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:22:02
How is not having inflation a problem? Bitcoin overall has deflated to thousands of times higher than its original value. I don't think you know what inflation and deflation mean.
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:13:38
Yeah it's really a bummer though. I sent the coins to my wallet without realizing I had set a passphrase a long time ago that I don't remember.
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:05:46
You're mostly right, but if a company held on to at least some of the bitcoins that they get, they would want to see the price go up.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:51:03
No, taxes are needed to fund government, not society; in my opinion government is not necessary to have a healthy society.
@_date: 2014-12-31 15:35:36
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:45:35


Are you implying that bitcoin suffers from inflation? It's quite the opposite. Inflation is when currency loses value, (like the USD) not when it gains value.
@_date: 2014-01-13 00:57:36
What if you don't have 40 euros?
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:00:00
I believe he's talking about taxes, not bank fees.
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:29:02
I'm just talking about how you play on a 12x server, as opposed to emerald dream which is 1x.
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:54:12
You are correct, they do however have an unfair advantage in that they receive support in the form of taxpayer money from the government.
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:21:02
Do you have any evidence to back up your claims?
@_date: 2014-04-24 23:33:01
The wallet was encrypted, he couldn't have stolen the bitcoins if he wanted to
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:00:14
No it doesn't
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:33:33
What if he sold meth on the silk road for bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:22:29
He stopped responding to my emails after I told him there was only ~$100 worth in my wallet
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:52:25
Yes my point is, you're gonna have to make sure that there is a demand for the coins to match the supply. If you reward too many coins when there is no demand for them, they will be worthless.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:05:56
You should develop it for earlier versions of the game (1.12 pls) and advertise it to the private server community. I currently play on the Emerald Dream server.
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:40:05
You mean drugs?
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:54:33
Did you ever tell them how much those bitcoins were worth?
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:23:32
0.1 BTC?? thats almost all of my wallet that i'm trying to recover. 0.01 maybe, that's like $10 instead of $100
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:00:29
You stole that directly from the youtube comments.
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:55:31
Defeats the purpose of a brainwallet
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:47:54
Do you really think they want to destroy bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:50:28


No, the fees will go up. Where did you get that misconception?
@_date: 2019-03-11 00:23:10
Its entirely possible
@_date: 2016-03-19 07:19:33
They are not "censoring the censorship" by removing from the sidebar. They just dont want to advertise it
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:16:58
hm, maybe more people would use bitcoin if there was room for more transactions in the blocks?
@_date: 2019-01-17 05:24:57
What do you mean exactly that it failed? just because the value is lower?
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:41:24
Id say food, water, and shelter have value to animals, wouldnt you agree?
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:13:36
Never actually recieved a tip
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:57:32
More options. If youre addicted to heroin youre gonna do anything to get some. If you only know one person selling, you probably wont care about the quality that much.
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:13:36
I'd say the only things with intrinsic value are those which are required to survive. I agree with all your other points though.
@_date: 2015-09-17 06:02:43
Do we really want to give bitcoins to the government so that they can just dump them on the market and increase the supply? We should be trying to get private businesses to accept bitcoin instead
@_date: 2015-10-08 05:23:33
Supply of new bitcoins gets cut in half. Lower supply + same demand = higher prices (hopefully)
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:18:47
So you're saying the block reward halving will have no effect on the supply? I didn't say the supply would be cut in half, but it will be slightly lower.
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:29:06
Do you have a source on that first claim? And assuming that is true, i dont see how the rich paying less taxes are hurting the middle class. Theyre not the ones taking money from people, the government is.
@_date: 2016-05-10 20:36:18
So youre saying the middle class is hurt by not being able to avoid taxes? If so i agree, i dont think anyone should be villainized for trying to avoid paying taxes
@_date: 2015-10-21 02:52:32
Why do we care what people think about us?
@_date: 2016-05-10 04:24:26
How does it hurt the middle class?
@_date: 2015-02-12 08:20:31
Sometimes, nothing. Could be millions of bitcoins that are completely gone because the hard drives that the wallets were stored on got destroyed/formatted.
@_date: 2015-02-23 03:35:09
You were probably logged into google already.
@_date: 2015-10-15 01:32:40
We are not in disagreement here
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:19:04
Or no governments. Goods and services are distributed most efficiently when there is no government interference.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:12:51
The funny thing is, this is what happens every single time the price of bitcoin drops. There is a pattern that it follows pretty closely EVERY SINGLE TIME. The price is just as likely to recover and get higher as it was when Silk Road got taken down.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:42:38
That would make it a really bad idea to keep money inside your PayPal account. you could lose money every month due to bitcoin price fluctuations.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:14:34
So, is a phony?
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:39:04
You're a condescending asshole. Just because you took a class on econ in high school you think you know more than every libertarian? You don't know shit.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:30:15
rofl wtf is this
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:47:03
But why would they send the 20 bitcoins through multiple adresses before finally sending them to the guy with the sign? It seems like they tried to obfuscate the fact that all the bitcoins were coming from the same person.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:12:25
I'm calling fake. Someone in the other thread proved that 20 of the ~23 bitcoins came from 2 adresses, 10 bitcoins each. The coins were sent through numerous addresses before going to the kid with the sign, which was possible an obfuscation effort.
