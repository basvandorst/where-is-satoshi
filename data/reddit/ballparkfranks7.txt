Yeah, I'm concerned as well.  I was concerned when it skyrocketed to 10k too though, so who fricken knows... ya know?

I agree, though the issues with high fees and slow transaction times could have been a root cause of LTC increase, not because someone wanted to pump and dump, but it may have convinced quite a few people that BTC can't scale properly because of it and they think LTC is a better investment.

I exclusively use bittrex and I love it.  I'm a little pissed though because all my transaction records prior to November have disappeared from the Order History and you can only access them by requesting a complete record, and those transactions don't show dates.  I also wish they would have a few coins they don't, so I've had to consider opening an account elsewhere to buy them.

I'm upset because I was hoping for alts to pump after 2x, then that cancelled and BTC rocketed...  I used all my BTC to buy alts anticipating the fork, and I basically got stuck with coins that are stagnant while BTC hits 10k.
Instead of watching my portfolio pump, I'm watching it stay within a few percent of its initial value.  I could have kept my BTC and doubled in value in the same time, and I could be buying alts right now.  Buuuuut.... nope.
It makes me wonder if I should cut my losses and go all in on BTC since it keeps doing the opposite of what everyone expects.  It probably won't even fall at 10k with my luck.  It'll shoot up to 20k before I know it and I'll still be sitting on the same altcoins.
