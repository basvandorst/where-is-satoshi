I agree.  I mean, it sucked for a little while, especially at the end of 2017.  But they deserve a little more credit.  For one, they make buying (top) crytpo far more accessible for new players in the game than other exchanges.  Because of that coupled with the 2017 hype that caused an influx of new buyers and traders, they were simply overwhelmed.  People need to remember also that crypto is still a rather new thing to the world, so the start-ups that make it possible for everyone aren't at their prime ability yet.  I'm confident Coinbase is hiring and upgrading every day to make things run as smoothly as possible in the near future.  After all, they're really going to need it for 2018.

I walked from a friends to another’s in -24 Centigrade weather last night with just a sweater and coat.  It was just a few blocks but I totally underestimated how brutal that would be.  I’m in Ohio.

I like this and thank you for it.  The video, though convincing, if biased.  However, biased does not necessarily mean incorrect. After watching it, it solidifies my understanding of bitcoin, why it’s valuable, and where it’s going.

I want to upvote this more.  Everyone upvote this please.

Right, and to avoid loss some people panic sell before they potentially lose more.  Loss aversion can also be synonymous with loss-phobia...that's probably the more appropriate term for the point of my post.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:44:35
I’d say give it more time.  It can show up today or may take a couple of days.  I’ve had to wait a while in the past too

My Mom told me I ought to try and email “that guy who created Facebook” and see if he can offer me any career advice...

I think Coinbase is also dealing with more traffic than they have ever seen before.  They probably are doing their best to adjust to all the new clientele.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:37:00
Had the account for 3 years but just started actually using it.  All these rules man...
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:08:56
Seriously, embrace the gift.  Put it into a bitcoin wallet or exchange, keep the password and log in info somewhere safe, and check back in on it in a few years.  Think about it like a savings bond but with a potentially much higher interest rate.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:22:29
Just curious, how much did you end up buying?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:34:03
People who have Bitcoin will have more money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:41:29
Do you always get double the gifts or is that just the same amount you would get on Christmas anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:10:42
Damn...too many hacks.  Hopefully it never happens to Coinbase.  I’m gonna move my coins somewhere safe real soon.

If I could do this for a living, I would literally be so happy.

We’re working on it ;)

I’ve been following them for a little over a month.  Yes, they’ve had some huge under predictions.  And like another commenter said, all the other coins follow the same subsiding trend toward 2022.

Don’t know what you’re taking about.  New to Reddit...

Goodnight, sleep tight, don’t let the crypto price bite.

Lol my bad! Or rather, autocorrect’s bad.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:43:44
Okay great.  Feeling less stupid now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:30:40
Okay let me know when and where to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:44
Not proof but somewhat convincing after seeing this.  Lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:15:22
Math thing.  Hoping there’s some math nerds among crypto nerds.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:59:19
awww �� I wish you many bitcoin for your birthday!
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:56:05
I like how you have to apologize beforehand with your post since all too often people on cryptocurrency subs are sanctimonious dildos ready to ruin all the fun by bitching about “shitposts” and obsessing over the “tech.” It’s like, we get it nerds, crypto and blockchain is fascinating technology, but quit being assholes ruining everyone’s fun who are mainly interested in the price.   It’s good to be interested in and learn about the tech behind it all for sure, but’s also okay to mainly be interested in the investment side of things.  Without us simpleton “noobs” without as much background in the subject, the price wouldn’t be where it is now.  End rant.

10900 on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:39:57
Guys, the swings are gonna get much bigger from here on.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:37:37
whup...down back to 10800
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:48:00
It keeps doing this.  The swings are getting much more massive now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:48:20
And other coins are doing the same thing.
@_date: 2018-03-03 22:18:12
You sound like a decent person.

Government overreach.  It's good that he didn't have to spend time in jail, but he should have not been fined $10,000 nor should he have had to been given 5 years probation or community service (HE ALREADY FREAKIN' DOES COMMUNITY SERVICE ANYWAY!).  In fact, I wish he would have been able to counter-sue.  Seriously, stories like this piss me off and make me believe the government is an evil institution who preys on innocent men like him.

The post you’re replying to is deleted but I will add that the loan Billy took from Fuckface is the equivalent of a student loan.

You know that awesome feeling you have when you're at a restaurant waiting on your food, you use the bathroom, and when you get back, it's OVER 10,000!?!

Taxation = theft.  Forced by others to pay something which you wish not to.  It's not just theft, but aggravated theft.  By definition.
Edit:  bechpls is more precise.  Extortion.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:28:20
I think some believe that it does.
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:06:43
You must understand that "proportional" does not imply equal.  If n is the number of bitcoin users and V is the value of bitcoin, then saying that V is proportional to n^2 simply means there is some constant k &gt; 0 such that V = kn^2 .  In the case of bitcoin, this constant k is clearly something less than 1 and relatively close to 0.
