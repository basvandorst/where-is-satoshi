It can be both.

Definitely undefined.  For that reason, and because it would have to be international, I highly doubt that any legal action could ever be successfully brought against them.
@_date: 2011-06-20 18:04:34
Right now I have no idea whether bitcoin is communist or libertarian.
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:30:19
So it doesn't seem to you that fear, uncertainty, and doubt are a reasonable reaction to the largest exchange being completely borked?
@_date: 2011-06-20 17:59:09
has a pretty robust peanut gallery.

It depends on how big the crash is, really.  I don't think there's any question that BTC is headed for a crash right now, but if the crash is large enough, it could make vendors stop accepting it, which would exacerbate the crash, until there was little to no value left.  So the real question is, "How speculative are bitcoins?"
@_date: 2011-06-15 19:48:20
Then who in their right mind is going to purchase something that volatile unless they were going to spend it immediately?  And if they were going to spend it immediately, then why wouldn't they be using cash?
(The obvious answer is "Because it's illegal".)
@_date: 2011-06-15 21:28:17
What exactly are darkpool transactions?  Is that just a transaction that's unlisted?
@_date: 2011-06-15 20:46:19
I was thinking that a vendor, seeing that a crash was in progress, would have to either start continually adjusting their prices upwards to match the market (and anticipate the falling value) or stop accepting bitcoins for at least until the crash was over.  I imagine that the latter is more likely, because what store would accept a crashing currency, especially if they have to put lots of infrastructure behind keeping track of what the market's doing?

At its peak of $266, you would have needed 3.8 million BTC in order to be a billionaire. There are [currently 11 million BTC]( in circulation. So yes, unless you think that a single person has more than a third of them, there were no billionaires.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:26:34
With the lack of a central authority (which is the whole point of the exercise), the only way it's going to change from the speculation dominated model is if people make a conscious effort to downplay that part of bitcoin. I find that unlikely though.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:21:42
But wait, there's more falling left to do!
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:20:30
How is that going to work if the market continues to be so volatile?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:29:06
Why would you do .02 trades when you can do .01 trades?
@_date: 2013-02-23 07:31:47
Reddit uses a time decay for its ranking. If two submissions have the same number of upvotes, the newer submission will be higher ranked. This means that if two submissions take different amounts of time to evaluate, the submission with the shorter evaluation time will be consistently ranked above the submission with the longer evaluation time. As a subreddit gets larger, this disparity between short-form and long-form submissions grows. (People often cite an attention span problem, but this issue would exist even if attention spans were long.)
So the ten-page articles are replaced by memes because memes rise to the top. And the people who originally came to the subreddit specifically for that are forced out, because all the top posts are now image posts, one-liners, or half paragraph self-posts. That skews the voting population, which gives the short-form content even more of an advantage. And of course RES compounds the problems in its own ways.
If you've ever wondered why all the larger subreddits turn to crap, this is why. is about 95% image posts now, but it wasn't always like that. The only tool that seems to work is strict mod control.
**tl;dr** Reddit algorithms give perverse incentives, and the effects become more pronounced when you add in more people.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:16:03
How? People need to be able to exchange BTC for USD. I don't know of any decentralized way to do that.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:34:51
I guess I'm not really in the know as far as bitcoin goes, but wouldn't it be possible to just do a transaction between sockpuppets?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:16:30
Me. But I mostly just find it interesting, and I think that it's not going to work as a currency so long as speculation has so much impact on the market. I remember back during the first bubble, when everyone was saying to buy buy buy and then sell sell sell. It's more entertaining to me than a money making thing, so I don't see any reason to "invest". If it takes off *as a currency* I would buy in, but with all the ups and downs ... not yet.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:45:08
I think his argument is that its instability makes it not function like cash.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:36:56


I guess we'll agree to disagree about whether that makes for a good currency. The good thing about cash is that you need to spend and invest it. The inflationary nature of cash means that it's constantly in circulation. With bitcoins, the incentive is to hold onto it, as an investment, which means that you get all the speculators, the wild changes in price, and all this other stuff that you really don't want in a currency. I'm skeptical that this will work itself out when bitcoins become more widespread, because I think these problems will prevent bitcoin from becoming widespread.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:38:59
The graph is a little bit wrong, since there are multiple (small) denial phases that make up the fear phase. What you'd expect to see is a jagged up and down (but mostly down) line, rather than a single plummeting line.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:43:20
Or an unorganized DDOS attack of people hammering their servers.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:29
Now it's almost double that. Fun times.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:31:40
A magic-the-gathering-trading-card-exchange cum bitcoin-market isn't properly engineered and implemented? Color me shocked.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:05:48
They're not larger enough to have poor grunts, as far as I know. Small operations like this don't face the traditional pressures of management - just internal peer pressure.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:55:33
The problem is that most people don't actually look at the labels on the axes, which makes a log scale graph counter-intuitive.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:52:43
The utility only exists to the extent that people think that bitcoin has value. You can't pay someone in Madagascar $10,000 in BTC if they don't think that your BTC are worth anything.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:39:27
What's the difference between a crash and a correction?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:20:53
You don't think there's a risk of panic selling?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:05:19
Isn't liquidity worse in every other market because they're so much smaller?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:07:19
Remember that MTGOX was originally designed as a Magic: The Gathering online exchange. It's no wonder that it's not built all that great for handling bitcoins if they made that drastic of a shift.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:33:15


That's what I disagree with. Dollars are valuable only because of confidence as well. The vast majority of gold's value comes from confidence (though it's fairly valuable in electronics as well). To say that "nothing has changed" when *confidence* has changed, and confidence is the whole ball game, strikes me as just incredibly idealistic. I understand all the benefits of bitcoin, but they don't do a damned thing unless people think that bitcoins are valuable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:32:09


Confidence has changed, which is the only thing that gives bitcoins its value.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:19:48
It looks like that's crashed/corrected as well.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:37:27
Yeah, and none of those companies is anywhere close to being worth two trillion dollars.
@_date: 2013-02-22 20:14:14
In practice, that's not how it works because of the flaws in reddit's algorithm.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:22:03
How would one go about shorting bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:53:58
But they only had over half the market! How bad could it be? /s
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:20:51
How is that hindsight bias? People were saying that from pretty much the day they came out (myself included). It doesn't take a genius to think that a custom built exchange for bitcoins would have been a lot better than one built for magic cards.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:43:03
Don't intermediaries kill the anonymity and decentralization aspects that make bitcoin so appealing? If you're going to use an intermediary, why not just use USD through that intermediary instead of BTC? If you're going to go through the Visa-for-bitcoin, what's the point?
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:32:19
Wasn't it stable for a couple of months after the last crash somewhere in the sub-40s?
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:57:28
It's not the network provider. If you ping you don't get the same sort of ridiculously long response times (or no replies) you'd expect from a normal DDOS (this is no longer true, but that's because they seem to have taken the whole thing down). The problem is with the trades, which means it's a problem with their setup. Alternately, the problem is a different (similar) attack where people make a ton of .01 BTC trades with themselves which chokes their resources (but would be easy to limit).
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:02:47
You can also just hit their API directly.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:41:04
Build a better exchange, and get people to start using it. MtGox is the biggest exchange because it's the biggest exchange, not because of any particular feats of engineering or the quality of their service.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:28:13
Most likely because it's like disagreeing with someone and then pointing at wikipedia. Without a specific article, there's no point in making a link.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:56:31
bitcoinity is also having massive lag.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:17:57
It depends on what you think "survives" means for bitcoins. If they crash down to less than parity with the dollar, they could still survive - it's just that a whole ton of unlucky speculators (and true believers) would lose their shirts. I think the true believers are enough that bitcoin won't just totally stop being used, unless a different cryptocurrency comes along to replace it. The vendors that accept bitcoin now usually do so because they think it's cool or support the ideology behind it, not because it's going to rake them in the cash. So I think BTC will survive - but I think a lot of people around here are over-estimating where the floor is.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:09:36
For bitcoin to be truly usable, it needs to have less currency speculation. I'm not convinced that shitty markets are the main problem here, since much of bitcoin right now seems to be people buying and selling in hopes of getting rich, rather than actually using it like a currency.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:03:08
If you can brute force the private key on a reasonable timescale, then bitcoin as a currency/commodity is pretty much dead.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:03:18
I really wonder if that's how it's handled in practice. When vendors take BTC, do they immediately convert to USD, or do they have significant BTC holdings? My guess would be that most of them convert over on a pretty regular basis in order to pay their expenses, because bitcoin doesn't seem to have a lot of business-to-business traffic, and I haven't heard of many employers paying their employees in BTC (which would be dubiously legal).
