I've recently started trading on localbitcoin and have been doing fairly well for a college student and I figured I'd have to pay some sort of taxes but I'm jnahure where to even start looking. Can anyone help me out? Any profits I make are from sale ads on LBC at the moment.

Localbitcoin.com is my favorite place to buy since it gives a wide variety of payment methods
