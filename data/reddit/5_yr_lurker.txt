If saying investing in cryptos = investing in stocks and you plan on long term investing then studies show that lump sum investing provides better returns than dollar cost averaging.  But I would not call the two equal.

Maybe? But I have seen nothing to believe it will reach another ATH. It still holds plenty of value so I plan on starting to DCA (mainly FOMO) in February.

What if BTC already hit its ATH?

HYSA are ~ 2-2.5% range so around break even on inflation. But yeah not great.

In the bubble of the crypto world, not so much outside of it.  I am just not convinced yet but am smart enough to bet a small amount on it.

Don't forget to file those capital gains with the IRS (if American).

That is 20% of your income which is a lot to be putting into a single speculative asset.  History shows diversification is the sure, long road to increasing your wealth.

Time is the greatest thing you have to build your retirement.  Losing 10+ years of compounding interest could significantly effect ones retirement (granted here we are talking 10 pounds).  My original point remains, putting 20% of ones income into a speculative asset is bad practice.  It does not matter how sure fire BTC is/think it is.

My bond fund was the green stock/bond fund I have.

Already hit its ATH.  Mark my words!

Won't happen.  I was suppose to have a flying car by now.
