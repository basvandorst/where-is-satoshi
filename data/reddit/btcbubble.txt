It's amusing what lengths the typical bitcoin evangelist will go to in order to legitimize their pumps. Metronomes and bubbles have nothing to do with each other you troll. Go pump somewhere else.
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:15:58
Can we just automatically get rid of all posts that mention the word 'faith'?
The entire point of Bitcoin is to not have to blindly follow anything. You're talking about it like it's some kind of goddamn religion. 
"Only those that truly believe will find eternal life and salvation!"
Bitcoin is a tool; not a deity that accepts sacrifices. Advocating for blind faith is not the way to go about discussing Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:35:15
Oh sure. Go over to bitcoinity.org and look at the six month chart.  
Do you see the downtrend since December?
The market is looking for a bottom and it still hasn't found it, despite all the desperate pumping that goes around here. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:44:12
I haven't heard "lunars" yet to describe them. I love it. Thank you for that. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:18:35
You're grasping at straws. 
Human beings use patterns to make sense of the world. The market for bitcoin is not rational. It will never do what you think it should do. 
Past performance is in NO WAY an indication of what is going to happen in the future. 
The price is falling because the last run up was a pump unlike anything many of us have ever seen. The price of $1000+ reflected the speculative price of bitcoin, not the intrinsic one. 
Bitcoin will continue to fall, and showing these kinds of images without any disclaimer is reckless and selfish. Pump and dump. Nothing more. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 00:57:04
There is no real reason to use Bitcoin in everyday life aside from ideology. 
On top of that, you have to factor in the headache of reporting your purchases to the IRS if you spend more than $600 in a given year. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:31:07
Bitcoin has value because demand has outweighed supply. 
The astronomical price you saw in December was the result of a pump like no other. 
If you watch this subreddit frequently, you can see all those that bought in at $600+ attempting to pump it further because they realize they bought into something that cannot sustain its current price levels. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:37:52
If you're looking for logical and rationale thought, you've come to the wrong place. Take a few minutes to see what gets upvoted here. 
"To the moon" and "cheap coinz"
This is a pump subreddit populated by those that lost out on the last dump. I can't tell you how long these cycles will continue, but it will come to an end sooner or later. I hope you're not holding the bag when it does. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:32:58
It's mind blowing how you're still pumping as the ship is sinking. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:26:05
It's almost as if the community can sense that the end is near. 
Just keep pumping everyone! Everything is fine!
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:29:30
The point is that there have been zero court cases in the world that involve the theft of Bitcoin. There aren't any cases where a court sides with a thief because there aren't any cases to begin with.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:24:11
It wouldn't be so hard if all the "bubble" and "to the moon" predictions perpetuated on this sub come true. 
A large amount of people here believe the growth will be exponential when it happens in the long term. $3,000 doesn't seem like too much of a stretch.
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:04:17
I'll take pump and dump for $5000, Alex.

The delusional honeymoon appears to be over. Reality is never fun, but it's inevitable. 
My only hope is that I was able to convince at least one person to not part ways with their money.

Ponzi Scheme, Bubble, Pyramid. Call it what you want, but it's a beautifully designed system that will take money from all those unfortunate enough to buy in too late. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:14:22
It isn't a crime if there are no laws making digital currency theft illegal. At least I know someone is going to go to jail when my Fidelity account gets stolen. 
Bitcoin is a free market at its purest right now, and people are starting to realize it isn't as wonderful as their utopian fantasies lead them to believe.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:03:10
Get your logic out of here! This is supposed to be a grand circlejerk about how the IRS has some personal vendetta against the pure intentions of bitcoiners.
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:37:29
They're trying to hide the fact that the infrastructure isn't as sound as the sheep believe.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:01:44
Well then it must have felt good for a while.
It's funny how life works, isn't it?
One day you're extremely wealthy because you got lucky. Then, you watch that wealth disappear day after day, but you tell yourself that this is temporary. Surely we'll see $1,000+ again, right?
Perhaps it takes both an entrance point (which you nailed), and an exit strategy? I know you don't have one. You live by the pump, and you die by the dump. I guess you didn't get the memo.
@_date: 2014-03-25 07:04:28
Hey, I don't like what he's saying! How dare he question my blind faith investment?! Must be a troll.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:58:57
The IRS is going to make an example out of at least one bitcoin public figure. The only question is who?
Bitcoin roulette is not something I want to play.
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:24:05
How dare you try to bring reality into this sub? Let the sheep believe they live in a bubble.

You have to love bitcoin evangelists. One second, they're preaching free market, next second they're hiding behind government regulation when something bad happens on the playground.
@_date: 2014-03-25 08:10:33
Bitcoin evangelists aren't exactly a sensible crowd to begin with. Go ahead and continue to pump while I try to help new and curious individuals steer clear from financial ruin.
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:19:12
Please show me one example of a court siding with someone who had their bitcoins stolen. Please show me one example of a singe person going to jail over stealing bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:04:01
Bitcoiners don't realize how incredibly speculative bitcoin is right now. 
A healthy majority are long bitcoin, but they want governments to categorize it as a currency even though a minority of people use it as one.
It'll be considered a currency when it stabilizes enough to actually be one. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 07:24:05
The pumping is just getting sad now. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:29:54
Blind faith is a recurring theme in bitcoinland
@_date: 2014-03-24 05:41:24
It's amazing how the evangelists are scheduling the pump and dumps now. It's very courteous.

@_date: 2014-03-28 18:53:36
The justifications from the pumpers and early adopters is wonderful. 
"Hey guys, I know it sucks for all of you that bought in after November, but just keep buying. The next pump might come any day now."
*Early pumpers then proceed to the nearest bank to collect their profits while laughing the entire way*
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:37:03
Welcome to the circus that is Stay awhile and you might see someone advocate tax evasion, completely blow their life savings, and then buy a pair of socks using bitcoin all in an afternoon.
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:18:10
If you truly think that there will be another pump, then go for it.
The name of the game in bitcoin is pump and dump. The last dump is still happening, and a ton of people are hurting. You'll notice that a lot of people are predicting a summer bubble... Yes, that's right, they actually let people know when they plan to pump now. Nice guys, these bitcoiners.
The MtGox fiasco was supposed to be the bottom. Now everyone is calling this the bottom. Who knows what the "bottom" will be next week.
Bitcoin is a long shot investment. Whatever money you put in, just assume it's going to disappear; that's the only way to play this game. There is nothing certain when it comes to new tech, and the amount of financial speculation taking place in this arena is overwhelming.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:32:04
To the masses, bitcoin is not math. It is something shrouded in mystery for many. They tend to hear about it when something terrible happens (which happens a lot these days). 
Governments, especially the United States government which is growing more intrusive by the day, will try to steer people away from dealing with something that the masses do not understand. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:22:21
Oh you're still fresh meat. I have one word of advice. Run. You're buying into the greatest scam the world has ever seen.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:57:09
Get out while you can. There's no reason to be a martyr.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:22:04
The brainwashing is starting to wear off. A price pumped up by speculation was never going to last long. One thing is for sure, the pump and dumpers are laughing all the way to the bank.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:06:14
They're long because they got in early. It's called pump and dump for a reason. Price gets pumped to levels not sustainable and then it all comes crashing down on the delusional, i.e. you.
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:49:37
Just open an exchange and declare bankruptcy. That seems like a decent way to acquire bitcoin.

I used the words "many of us" for a reason. There are a ton of people here that weren't around in April 2013. 
But I guess that wasn't a good enough pump. I apologize.
Hey guys, cheap coins now next bubble soon to the moon yadda yadda yadda.

You would scan the private key and then be in possession of some bitcoin. I'm guessing OP placed these in an area where there is at least one restaurant that accepts BTC, but who knows.
If there isn't anywhere to spend them, then you basically have the promise of a free lunch in the future when you do stumble across a restaurant that will actually accept it.
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:19:55
I would introduce you to my friends Pump and Dump, but it seems like you're already very friendly with each other.

All hope is lost for this one. He's going down with the ship.
Buy some more. I dare you. You'll have a great story to tell in a few years about how you bought into the collapse thinking it was going to change the world.

@_date: 2014-03-31 04:46:42
Oh it's awesome that one of the early pumpers is here.

I'm curious as to how much of that initial stash was liquidated when we saw the highs in December?

Thank you for acknowledging what this subreddit truly is. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:52:52
You are 100% right. The average bitcoin user will not care about keeping track of anything small. 
The audits will come and so will the posts whining about how unfair and ridiculous the IRS is being. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:11:33
Would you prefer "To the Moon"? Or how about "Cheap Coins"?
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:36:04
You're right, my "trolling" caused the fall from $480 to $450 within the last half hour. 
Wow, I'm pretty good when it comes to scooping up the cheap coins, huh?

Sad and pathetic pump spamming is what this sub has turned into.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:12:59
I'm not denying a digital future for currencies. I welcome it and the benefits it brings. Where I see a serious problem is how the delusional on this subreddit are pumping something so hard because they bought into it a few months ago, only waiting to dump it once the early adopters make a quick buck.
Something better than Bitcoin will come along, and when that happens, bitcoin's novelty will wear off. The people that fell for the pump and dump will be hit the hardest while the "To the moon" crowd laughs all the way to the bank.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:14:08
A convoluted sense of self righteousness isn't going to help you during an audit. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:53:44
In the long run he's better off not having any bitcoin anyway. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:43:01
I'd be willing to believe a pump when someone throws around words like "math and science" all the time. Please continue to pump while I continue to hopefully save at least one person from blowing their life savings while listening to you.
@_date: 2014-03-24 05:13:14
If it sounds like a pump and dump, then it probably is one. The evangelists are starting to grasp at at anything they can at this point. It looks like they're trying one last pump before they call it a night on this bitcoin fiasco

@_date: 2014-03-31 03:52:31
I would argue that iPhone apps have a legitimate and mature market. Bitcoin's market might be legitimate, but it is no way mature. The infrastructure supporting bitcoin is definitely better now than it was year ago though.
Something as game changing as crypto currencies need time to develop and grow without people speculating on price constantly. 
It's easy to forget that bitcoin is a technology. This sub is constantly pumping the price like it's a goddamn stock.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:38:52
The pompousness in your reply is exactly the reason this community is a joke outside of this subreddit. It always turns into a pissing contest of how much crypto lingo you can spew out after reading the wiki entry.

Someone needs to add a bit of balance to the typical blind faith garbage that this sub tends to consist of. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 06:30:04

@_date: 2014-03-25 21:15:35
It takes either courage or immense stupidity to insinuate that you evade taxes on a public subreddit.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:20:11
I'm shooting down mindless and selfish pumping. It went unchecked for too long.
@_date: 2014-03-25 06:42:46
You're going to catch a lot of flak for speaking the truth. Bitcoin is so incredibly underdeveloped relative to price that it's laughable.
Didn't you get the memo? You're supposed to pump every chance you get so you can cash out once a new batch of newbies comes in.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:43:22
Oh stop being dense. Microsoft points don't have cash value. You spend them within Microsoft's ecosystem, not out in the real world. You pay taxes when you convert fiat into MSFT points anyway.

Why don't you just judge the content instead of looking for every excuse to label people you disagree with as a troll?
Bitcoin grew too fast for its own good. It's going to take a miracle to save it at this point.

Yes, blame the user. 
If a decent amount of users are "failing", perhaps it's the service itself that is broken and not consumer friendly.
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:03:52
Many evangelists have zero experience in finance so they don't understand what capital gains tax is. It's going to be a massive pain to track every single purchase you made throughout a year in order to account for value added.
I can't wait for the "The IRS are bullies! They're auditing me because I don't know how to file my taxes properly!" posts. Get the popcorn ready.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:03:05
How about $3000? Seems like someone could easily spend that much on "small purchases" in a year.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:01:53
That's simply an example of government making sure too many people aren't sucked into the ponzi scheme that is bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:14:43
Bitcoin the technology took a back seat to bitcoin the pump and dump scheme a long time ago. I've spent a fair amount of time learning cryptography, but I acknowledge it is not my forte; finance is. 
The technology is revolutionary but the speculation that is taking place is pure greed by early adopters. They pump and pump and then cash out to diversify their portfolios while an entire wave on new participants ends up taking the biggest hit.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:39:54
The heavy pumping from last night is starting to have an effect. The only question is when the dump is going to happen. Just make sure you aren't holding the bag when it does.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:41:26
Haha holy shit. People are so depressed with how much they've lost, so they continue to buy into the collapse...
The ship is sinking! Stop doubling down!

Blindly dismissing things is one hell of a way to live your life troll

Let me know how that audit feels next year.
@_date: 2014-03-25 07:28:08
Every time someone brings up how bitcoin the speculative price bubble has far outgrown bitcoin the technology, everyone gets labeled a "troll".
The demise of bitcoin will be the "to the moon" crowd. It comes off as pump and dump to average people.

You call it trolling, I call it doing a public service. If I save one person from buying into this delusion, then I'll sleep better at night.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:24:44
It's truly refreshing to see someone on here who isn't blindly following something simply because they bought in early. Critical thinking is a rare sight on this sub nowadays.
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:26:53
Many of the posts here are of a similar sentiment. 
"I bought in when it was pumped to hell by the early adopters. I don't care too much because I believe it in bitcoin long term."
You lost on the last pump, so now you need to pump it so the next group that comes in here ends up posting how they bought in at $5000, but they still believe even though it crashed down to $2000.
One of these pumps will completely kill bitcoin, and you will have no one to blame except yourselves. 
The intelligent/lucky ones here will have cashed out by then.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:38:23
You said it brother. The audits by this time next year are going to be oh so satisfying to watch.
Let's see how tough these bitcoin "anarchists" are when the IRS wants to have a talk with them. It's easy to be a big man on the internet when you get to hide behind a screen.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:04:09
The community that frequents this sub is comprised of a generation of very young adults who are incredibly entitled. Ideally, they'd like the get rich quickly while doing nothing except saying "to the moon" every chance they get.
Once you understand who the audience is, the reactions are understandable.
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:30:43
Does this predict the exact moment the pumpers are going to dump?
@_date: 2014-03-25 07:17:36
I can have all the cheap coinz I want once this all collapses on itself and everyone moves on to the next cryptocurrency waiting to be pumped by speculators.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:27:04
The reaction becomes very understandable once you realize who the typical bitcoiner is. 
Chances are they are a young adult male; possibly even a teenager. Many have backgrounds in IT and technology in general. Few have meaningful economic and finance backgrounds.
Add some inexperience when it comes to tax law, a little bit of entitlement, and you get a recipe for outrage anytime you have to pay for living in a society that allows us to mess with digital currency instead of worrying where our next meal is going to come from.
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:12:03
It's nearly impossible to "ban" bitcoin. It's math after all. We're bound to see warnings and possibly bans on merchants dealing with it. Governments can make getting bitcoin nearly impossible by banning banks from dealing with it.
