I hope I'm not late.
I want it!

Care to explain the dangers of deflation?

Antivirus software are aberrations to security and privacy. They have total access to your data and network and are closed source.
People need to look for open source solutions.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:30:48
They don't ask if you have bitcoin, only if you know about bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:17:36
Open source doesn't imply non-commercial. The project can even sell compiled binaries if needed.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:04:44
I was just thinking about this recently. If satoshi has posted in the forum and emailed some people, the server must have the ip used along with some other metadata.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:23:18
That's a good idea to reuse old phones. I recommend installing lineageos without google apps.  
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:50:14
Satoshi's thoughts.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:15:32
but maybe if nobody were buying things with bitcoin, the price wouldn't be so high? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:17:02
You're not paranoid, you're absolutely correct. We can't trust closed source wallets and they shouldn't exist.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:30:59
But you can encrypt the usb.
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:32:17
That's a great idea! No one is going to put the hands on that paper wallet anymore
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:36:59
That's why we need decentralised exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:04:33
And I'm antisocial because I stay at home crying because I didn't buy bitcoin back then...
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:57:11
wait, the prices dramatically collapsed in February 1637 but the peak was in March 1637? How is that possible?
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:17:10
Try restarting your modem. Many providers give you a new ip when you reconnect.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:52:59
Discipline and patience? Once I forgot about a paper wallet and found it a year later. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:09:48
It's complicated :)
One approach is to make the software open source but not the virus database, something similar to what some game developers do by releasing the games open source but not the assets.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:04:07
Nice try.
If you don't have the private keys, you don't have the coins.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:02:56
What a nice way to get rid of the lazyness and finaly start using segwit address ;)
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:38:03
Just monitor the temperatures and don't let them get close to the maximums defined by the manufacturer.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:38:56
But you can get more bitcoin if you mine an altcoin and sell it for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:35:19
They're supporting the poor miners who need the fees to buy food for their children.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:01:04
Hard to say. Everybody always says it's not worth but I would like to have mined some years ago when it was "not worth". By the way, if you want to do that, try looking for cryptocurrencies designed for cpu mining.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:20:27
It's very troubling but if we compare it to the amount of power that banks, corporations and governments have over money, it's not that much.
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:40:24
but what about XBT?
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:38:25
I would add that we need an open source and non web-based app.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:11:17
I know that feel bro.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:44:58
Do you remember how the site looked like? Maybe the onion was a tor version for a surface site. You can try looking for bitcoin related sites from 2013 on archive.org nd if you recognize it, go for the new version and try to login. The chances are overwelmingly against you but for 500btc it's totally worth a try!
I wish you the best of luck!

You can make a room covered in aluminium. All devices inside the room will be cold storage lol
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:34:30
You need to have the private key to the address. Do you remember if the the site gave you the key? Otherwise, it will be very difficult to get your coins.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:36:40
Here's mine:

@_date: 2017-06-21 00:00:08
I can't create an account, it says the username is invalid
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:25:18
Come on, we all know he used another phone.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:58:39
I'm glad to be useful, keep up your good work!
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:24:13
I'm using firefox 53 on linux and I've tried the usernames vitor, vitordsg, vitorsgoncalves, vitor000 etc
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:15:26
But I used only letters and numbers...
