I don't think that's a valid thing to say. Keys are not generated by a single call of the rand() function. Perhaps there is no builtin LGC that will give you more than 32 bits of entropy, but crypto libraries have matured over the last several decades and are operating with far more entropy than 32 bits.
You'll notice that libraries like OpenSSL have all implemented [their own random functions]( to address this issue.
I understand that the site says "If you're using private keys generated from standard pseudorandom sequence of numbers," implying nothing more than a call to rand(), but that seems very misleading seeing as current Bitcoin key generation software is not implemented that way.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:45:47
Namely not using just one single call to rand() to generate their addresses.

Do you actually believe the things you just wrote?
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:29:01
Oh no, more opportunities for average folk to get their hands on Bitcoin.

I'm not positive how this would be implemented. When you send bitcoin to a pubkey (well really an address/scriptPubKey) there's no 'receipt' from the person who owns the pubkey. They could have it locked down in cold storage or on a hot wallet and the transaction would be the same. What kind of response are you expecting to be able to prove they still control the pubkey, and what do you mean by 'active'?

Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution states that although the federal government does not have the ability to regulate commerce within a state, they undeniably have the power to regulate interstate commerce. As marijuana is illegal federally, this is 100% within their jurisdiction.

The extra funds you are seeing in Bitcoin-Qt are contained in change addresses, not your normal wallet address. Blockchain.info is a fairly authoritative source though -- I would trust it over your local view the majority of the time. Are you sure you didn't recently send 0.025 BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:15:11
What? Electrum explicitly trusts third parties through its use of Obelisk servers.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:45:01
That's already how most desktop RNGs grab data anyway. I don't believe you're doing anything different than any other Bitcoin keypair generator.

Not sure about other OSes (though OS X will be almost exactly the same, but Linux is just:
    dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=2048 | sha512sum
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:24:07
You could easily print your own with a Replicator 2 if you can get access to it. They'd turn out just as nice and be dirt cheap.

I think a signed SHA hash of the whole disc is necessary. Ubuntu Live CDs are generally verified by dd'ing the entire disc and piping that directly to sha512sum or whatever hashing utility you'd like to use. It doesn't make sense to rely on people verifying each individual Ubuntu file, and the fact that the html file was added means that the ISO hash has changed so published full-CD hashes for standard Ubuntu discs are not helpful.  
In short, I'd like to be able to do a 'cat /dev/cdrom | sha512sum' or equivalent and be able to compare that to a signed hash you post.
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:03:28
Where did they say that? 
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:24:42
Sounds like the exchange has a larger problem?

He didn't recommend that anybody use it to store Bitcoin private keys, just explained how a hypothetical system that does so may work. Chill out.

More computing power is not required for larger blocks, except when creating the initial hash. The thing you "mine" ie the hash that the nonce is appended do does not change.

I was gonna take issue with the "MongoDB = incompetence" remark but there's too much else that's wrong with this comment for it to be worth it.

Cite your sources for reduced keyspace in C/C++ programs?

That's a great point, I didn't realize they had implemented OAuth.

How else would you expect a site like mint to grab data from a 3rd party? It's all APIs...

The trick here isn't the incorrectly named file, it's that what he's doing in the above screenshot is running both of those commands at the same time -- it's a race condition. The OpenSSL verify command finishes *before* the base64 decode finishes, meaning that "sig.asn1" contained something valid before the command was executed -- but not the content he claims it does.

Thanks so much! It went through alright. I'd like to do another transaction soon -- how are the wait times looking?

Hi. I'm curious if I'm in the same delayed queue.
Order ID is here: 3eef6623-1e15-464f-bc40-66f7e207a5d5
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:31:50
I have sent a message through the main support channel. I got the automated response but nothing else. I'm concerned because I placed the order 5 days ago and people who have placed orders after me are already getting their funds.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:45:44
Sounds good. I'll throw something together and be in touch.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:05:08
What do you even mean by this 
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:27:50
Is there a reason you don't want to import them into a wallet? It will handle that all for you.

I am happy to work to develop something for you. I could get you set up with a simple marketplace-type deal and Bitpay/Stripe/whatever integration, depending on your needs. Let me know if you're interested. My web stack of choice is Django but I'm happy to work in PHP if you'd rather host it on a webhost of your choice.

Nothing. They never touch the network, they aren't "created." A private key can be matched to an address offline. If someone else happens to generate the same private key later on they can use it no problem, it's not "burning through" them, but the address space is exponentially, mind-bogglingly larger than you can imagine.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:08:14
Or alternatively you could make a template, or be provided a BIP38 encrypted private key and a public key.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:07:25
Why would you need the public key over the address itself?
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:08:27
These look great!
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:35:18
What? How did you screw it up?
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:07:14
Not quite -- it's a hash of the public key.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:57:01
Sure!
