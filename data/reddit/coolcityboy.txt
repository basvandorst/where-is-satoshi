Protecting Chrome users from malicious extensions
Posted: Tuesday, May 27, 2014
We’re constantly working to keep Chrome users safe as they browse, with built-in features like Safe Browsing, which blocks many types of malicious websites and downloads. In the case that malicious software has managed to hijack your settings, we've added a “reset browser settings” button, so you can get things back to normal. But since the bad guys continue to come up with new ways to cause our users headaches, we are always taking additional measures. We previously announced that we’re making it more difficult for malware to secretly install unwanted Chrome extensions. Starting today, we’ll start enforcing this policy.
Malware can change how browsers work by silently installing extensions on your machine that do things like inject ads or track your browsing activity. If you notice strange ads, broken web pages or sluggish browsing after installing some new software or plugins, you could be affected.
From now on, to protect Windows users from this kind of attack, extensions can be installed only if they're hosted on the Chrome Web Store.  With this change, extensions that were previously installed may be automatically disabled and cannot be re-enabled or re-installed until they're hosted in the Chrome Web Store.
For developers, we’ll continue to support local extension installs during development as well as installs via Enterprise policy. And if you have a dedicated installation flow from your own website, you can make use of the existing inline installs feature.  Windows developer channel users, as well as those on other operating systems, are unaffected by these changes.
You can reach out to us in our support forums if you're running into problems, or if you think an extension was disabled incorrectly.  If you're a developer and your extension isn't in the store yet, please submit it today. This is just one more step we are taking to make sure our users can browse safely, and enjoy all the Web has to offer without worrying.

Sounds like Robocoin is feeling the pressure from other ATM manufacturers who understand that operators do not want to pay recurring fees for a piece of hardware.
IMO paying a $10,000 fee to operate royalty-fee structure is ridiculous.

The current value is only relevant to the current available balance in the address.

-Paymium is neither a bank, nor a PSP. And it doesn't need to be.
-Crédit Mutuel Arkéa is the bank that is used by Aqoba for its financial infrastructure needs,
-Aqoba is a registered PSP,
-Paymium works with Aqoba in order to operate as an intermediary when individuals and corporations wish to engage in the exchange of Bitcoins,
-The "Garantie des dépôts" mechanism (which resembles the FDIC) covers our clients against a collapse of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa bank.

I also think you're wrong (and the market is proving that right now as we speak).
As ASICs continue to dominate in the Bitcoin ecosystem, there are many other inefficient cpu/gpu miners that are willing to back other altcoin currencies with computer processing, financial backing, and trust.
Of course there will be coins that are an obvious attempt at a pump and dump scheme, however, there are many smart people out there that see an opportunity to try and improve Bitcoin's core and people would be willing to invest a portion of their virtual currency portfolio in innovative alternatives.
Finally, I also believe that having several altcoin options and the ability to create one easily, will force governments from around the world to embrace this revolution and not try to use draconian methods to stop its acceptance.

**SatoshiDice.com takes in over $1,000,000 USD in bets per day! Don't be jealous, build your own dice game. Here are the top 3 reasons why this is possible.**
Put aside the debate on whether Satoshi Dice is a bad or good thing for Bitcoin and the blockchain.
Let's take a moment to talk about making money, and lots of it!
Sometimes in life, ideas need to be challenged. Now, it may seem like an uphill battle for someone to build a new service that can beat the established incumbent. However, I've seen it time and time again, that this can ABSOLUTELY be done. Here are some ideas on why you CAN build a successor to Satoshi Dice:
*TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC!*
Build a complete turnkey affiliate program that allows savvy individuals to generate and refer traffic to their own skinned dice clone. The operator needs to provide different website themes, custom URL, traffic and betting stats, localized in all major languages, and of course provide a full bankroll.
The  reason why Satoshi Dice is so successful, is because of their integration with Blockchain.info. Just imagine if your local bank implemented a feature to easily gamble from within your online banking (some would say they already do this with investment accounts lol). THAT BEING SAID, PARTNERSHIPS WITH WALLET DEVELOPERS ARE KEY!
Many people, including myself, are very interested in mining or investing in Altcoins (ie. Litecoin, Namecoin, etc). There are not many places to spend these other virtual currencies and thus gambling some of those coins is probably inevitable.
*BAD LUCK*
In a business as grey as this one, bad stuff can (and probably will) happen that is completely outside of one's control. For example:
* Hackers compromising servers and stealing funds
* Targeted government domain seizures
* Miscellaneous legal problems
* Bad press and tarnished reputation
Like they say, patience is a virtue and sometimes just being somewhere at the right place, right time is the key to success.

By ROBIN SIDEL and ANDREW R. JOHNSON
State regulators are warning virtual-currency exchanges and other companies that deal with bitcoin that they could be closed down if their activities run afoul of state money-transmission laws, according to people familiar with the matter.
According to people familiar with the situation, banking regulators in California, New York and Virginia in recent weeks have issued letters telling the companies that they need to follow the state rules or prove that the rules don't apply to them.
The warnings fall short of formal "cease and desist" orders, which would demand that the companies immediately stop engaging in their business, these people said.
Still, the moves show that state regulators have moved beyond merely scrutinizing virtual currencies and now are taking steps to prevent people and companies from using them for illegal activities. Federal regulators already are cracking down on virtual currencies.
Similar actions are expected from other states in coming weeks and months, according to people familiar with the matter. California, New York and Virginia are three of the 48 states that require the companies to obtain money-transmission licenses to operate. South Carolina and Montana don't have such rules.
The money-transmission rules vary among states, but most require detailed financial data, business strategy and information about the company's management. States also typically require companies to put up a bond that could run as high as several million dollars.
The actions aren't related to the announcement last week that Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin trading exchange, has halted withdrawals of customer funds in U.S. dollars. The Tokyo company said it was making system improvements.
Unlike dollars or euros that are backed by a central bank, bitcoin users can create the units in a process called "mining." Users also can trade the currency on a number of exchanges or swap it privately.
The state actions come three months after federal regulators issued guidelines placing virtual-currency exchanges under the same comprehensive anti-money-laundering requirements as traditional money-transmission businesses such as Western Union Co. WU +0.92% Since then, a handful of bitcoin exchanges have registered with the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
The California Department of Financial Institutions has issued at least three warnings to bitcoin-related companies in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the actions. One of the recipients is the Bitcoin Foundation, an industry-backed group that promotes the digital cash.
Patrick Murck, general counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation, said it is a nonprofit organization and doesn't engage in money transmission. The group is formulating its response to the letter it received from regulators last week.
A spokeswoman for the California banking department declined to comment on the warning letters, saying the communications are confidential and "the goal is safety and soundness and compliance with the laws that DFI enforces."
California is particularly important to the bitcoin community because many of the startup companies that are tied to the virtual currency are based there. California and New York are known for having stricter money-transmission laws than other states.
"Bitcoin businesses are spending a lot of time and energy figuring out how to stay out of California," said Peter Vessenes, chief executive of CoinLab, a Bainbridge Island, Wash., company that has registered as a money-services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. CoinLab is waiting to launch any exchange-related services until it gets its "state licensing strategy sorted," said Mr. Vessenes, who also is chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation.
The New York Department of Financial Services issued a similar letter to BitInstant, a New York company that allows customers to buy and sell bitcoins. The company earlier this month alerted customers on its website that it wasn't accepting cash deposits "as we make steps to transition to our new website."
Charlie Shrem, chief executive of BitInstant, couldn't be reached for comment. The company has registered as a money-services business with federal regulators.
"Virtual currency firms inhabit an evolving and sometimes murky corner of the financial world," Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services, said in an interview.
"The extent and nature of their operations morph constantly, so it's important for regulators to ask the hard questions and stay ahead of the curve in order to root out dangerous or illegal activity," he said.
In Virginia, a company called Tangible Cryptography suspended the purchase of the currency through its service called FastCash4Bitcoins after receiving a letter from state regulators who received a complaint that the company was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter, according to a notice on its website. Company representatives couldn't be reached for comment.
Tangible Cryptography said on its website that its activity is exempt from licensing requirements and that the commission's initial assessment contained factual errors.
"While we respond to the commission's notice, the prudent action is for the company to suspend all new transactions," the company said.
A spokesman for the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions declined to comment on whether it has issued similar notices to other companies.

A three-month-old company with ties to one of the biggest promoters of the virtual currency bitcoin has filed for bankruptcy protection with less than $50,000 in assets.
Alydian Inc., a unit of CoinLab Inc., on Friday filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. bankruptcy court in Seattle. The 10-page court filing didn't disclose why Alydian filed for bankruptcy or how it hopes to repay its debts.
CoinLab is a bitcoin start-up run by Peter Vessenes, who is also chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation. The foundation is essentially a nonprofit trade group that has gained attention in recent months for promoting bitcoin and supporting new rules aimed at making it more accepted.
CoinLab is one of the best-known names in the fledgling virtual-currency industry, describing itself as a "bitcoin business incubator." It has won credibility because it has attracted funding from venture capitalists such as Silicon Valley's Draper Associates, which pumped $500,000 into the company last year.
Mr. Vessenes, who signed the bankruptcy petition, couldn't be reached for comment. Alydian's bankruptcy attorney also couldn't be reached. A spokeswoman for the Bitcoin Foundation declined to comment.
CoinLab announced the formation of Alydian in August, touting it as "its newest portfolio company" that would develop bitcoin-mining solutions for customers. "Mining" is the term used to describe the computer-generated creation of the virtual currency. The filing doesn't include Coinlab.
Unlike dollars or euros that are backed by a central bank, bitcoin users trade the currency on a number of exchanges or swap it privately. Some merchants also accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services.
Bitcoin trading has been on a rollercoaster this year. The currency nearly quintupled earlier this year, leaping from roughly $50 in mid-March to $230 in April. It traded at about $100 in August, but was fetching $237.50 in Monday trading on the Tokyo-based Mt.Gox exchange.
Federal and state regulators have been cracking down on bitcoin transactions and pushing companies to follow comprehensive anti-money-laundering requirements just like traditional money-transmission businesses such as Western Union Co.
CoinLab, which is based in Bainbridge Island, Wash., has registered as a money-services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a unit of the Treasury Department.
Alydian said in court papers that it owes $600,000 to CoinLab Inc. It also listed $3 million in debt to New Zealand's XRay Holdings LLC and $40,000 in debt to Mr. Vessenes.
The filing was made in the name of Alydian affiliate CLI Holdings Inc.

Coinagram.com is a much, much better domain name and its for sale! Generic 'coin' terms are going to be the trend now considering that Litecoin and other alt-coins are picking up in popularity.

IRC chat, he/she didn't give too many details.
Rumors generally don't have links, take what you want from the claim.

I never said that this will eliminate organized crime. They'll still be involved in distribution, finance, and probably even maintaining the digital marketplaces themselves.
It's the local gangs that will be affected, because their customers can order anywhere online and have it delivered straight to their door.

A developer should run with this idea but instead use upgradeable army tanks (ie. better armor, weapons, reload speed, etc.).
**Go Internet!**

Except 90% of the downloads actually abandon getting the whole 10GB blockchain.
**This needs to be fixed asap!**

Governments are ramping up a shadow war to make it incredibly difficult to use crypto-currencies. A well thought out and innovative altcoin can provide value to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Edward Snowden has showed us that governments are actively tracking purveyors of disruptive technologies (Tor, encrypted email, crypto currencies).

I agree with you that Robocoin's ATM is probably going to be DOA for a number of reasons (cost, cash dispensing regulations, size, etc).
However, Lamassu's machine is going into production this month and from what I've heard, they've built up a lot of respect in the Bitcoin community. If I had to put my money on someone in this space, it's them.

When it comes to money (or digital forms of that), I think Google might be a little more motivated than you might think.
Remember they have a new company philosophy, "more wood behind fewer arrows".

Hmmm, that's a pretty darn good idea I must say!
A marketplace for rich people, where they can easily sell valuable assets and keep the funds secret from other 3rd parties (divorce proceedings, bankruptcy, government etc).

Namecoin concept is great and one day people will embrace it.
