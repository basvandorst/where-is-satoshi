a doublespend attack... is a type of race condition... but please. explain how a race attack works, since i obviously don't know.

Careful folks, everything after this comment is just bipartisan whining.

bitcoin is a protocol.  you know what protocol was around 20 years ago that is no longer today? NTTP.

the same reason they're not rushing out and buying stock in GOOG or APPL.  it's too high, $800 for a lottery ticket that may make or break them?  may as well keep putting into google or apple and make money as people continue to search the internet with their ipads.  or into high dividend stocks like AT&amp;T or Coach as people continue to buy purses from their cell phones.  what is it bitcoin can do right now?  instantly send money to africa for a fraction of a percent?  purchase overstocked goods from a bargain-hunting website?  buy illegal munitions and pharmaceuticals from the feds?  bitcoins makes those powershares ETFs look really safe for any low to moderate risk investor

you do realize bitcoin is not truely anonymous right?
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:10:45
so you spent the same coins twice?

Fuck that, i'll just reverse the charge.  Oh wait..

I know, right?!  I'm paying about $2600 a year for a measly 2000 sq ft on a 1/4 acre.  I would kill to drop my property tax to a reasonable amount

we face that consequence, just like we did in the 2000s (and the 90s, and the 70s and the 20s etc), with stagflation. the opposite effect of that is a total loss of wealth which would massively affect the ordinary joe.. the 1% rich will still be 1% rich, they can still survive.  your parents 401k will be decimated and they would be on food stamps.  the whole noise about low interest rates and high unemployment is *because* of 2008.  if you wish to discuss bubbles, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are playing right into the powers-to-be end game.  if they crash because everyone is rushing to it, guess what will save all the people, hedge funds, pension funds, investment accounts.. it ain't the euro

even if it goes to zero, will keep it above $10

this, folks.  it happens today with ARM, they license out their chip design to different companies who take it to fab plants of their choosing.  it wouldn't take much for a government entity to do the same.
hell, ghash.io have already successfully performed doublespend attacks, so for all we know ghash.io IS the government entity testing their capabilities

touche.  we shall see what happens.  i'm not holding my breath at that 1% until bitcoin is easier to get in the hands of ordinary joe.
tl;dr: happy cake day!

If I called your post a putrid mess of conservative bullshit, it would make (a) me sound like an elite leftist asshole and (b) you sound like a misplaced republican.. almost libertarian.  If I called your post an ugly liberal's wetdream, it would make (a) me sound like a crotchity rightwinger and (b) you seem like a butch lesbian.
Words make an impact and can steer others to or away from your conversation, even if your point is a good/valid one.  Using virtual vs digital will further ingrain in the not-so computer savvy users a predetermined mindset.  Virtual will insinuate it's not real, it's like buying candy crush dollars, facebook gifts, or GTA dollars.  Why waste your money on that?  Digital currency, on the other hand, makes you think of your phone.  That's digital.  Digital TV came out a few years ago and killed analog.  To the point where analog is considered old and grainy and digital means it's a future technology that is here today.
Don't get it twisted, if you care about the future of cryptocurrency you are better off passionately defending the digital currency debate.  Even saying crypto-currency is better than "virtual currency" as it forces the other person to understand what makes this currency different.  When I heard the bitcoin foundation and all the proponents of bitcoin at the senate hearing call it a virtual currency, I cringed.  Seriously, it's digital currency. 
EDIT: I WILL PROBABLY BE DOWNVOTED.  SORRY IF YOU DO NOT FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO ABOUT A POTENTIAL FUTURE GAME CHANGER IN WEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS IN GENERAL

Bitcoin, the third party in this case, has all knowledge of all monetary transactions.  So if you truely want privacy in transactions, you should not have a trail (paper or digital).  This fact alone means bitcoin is not truely anonymous.
I don't know why you are trying to start an argument with me (asking my opinion on what is more right).. I'm just pointing out Bitcoin is not anonymous.  It can be used in pseudo-anonymous ways, but you can very well be "outed" with simple analysis.

you don't need 51% to doublespend, 51% just guarantees your attack to go through.  with a majority of computing power you can still doublespend, especially if you mine several consecutive blocks.
please read up on how bitcoin works, kthx

1.3% 4 weeks into a 52 week year?  yeaa that's like saying the 10-year t-note has a pretty good chance at closing under 2% in 48 weeks (read: not likely)

Wouldn't the biggest holder of BTC be the mtgox thieves?  Didn't the owner of silkroad have more than 150k BTC?  Didn't silkroad itself have more than 150k BTC?  
Too many questions, I think there are a lot more owners of BTC than you care to realize.

A decentralized authority will fix all the problems instead of the obvious faults created from the checks and balances of a government directed by the people!  Freedom!  All hail bitcoin, fixing in 5 years what central banks couldn't for the past 100 years!

@_date: 2013-11-19 00:08:06
here's the biggest one.  they buy the bitcoin when you make the purchase.  they just don't release it to you until said date.  
it's the sell-off i worry about

how do we, reddit, know this wasn't the first time?

i'm saying, he could be complaining about this, but this is just one of his monthly overdraft charges and he's getting tired of having to foot the bill for not balancing his books.  we don't know.  2 sides to every story
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:06:29
serious question.  what happens if they don't release from escrow or claim the money was never deposited?
