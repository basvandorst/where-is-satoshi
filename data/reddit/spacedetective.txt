I think it's more likely to head 5x down than up. The mainstream attention came, got burned, and won't be back any time soon.

It may be better to pre-panic because the lower it goes then the faster it will drop.

It was largely the money brought in by mainstream news attention that drove it to ATH. They promptly got burned and won't be back anytime soon. The fact that put options now allow the sharps to bet against bitcoin makes it more difficult to return to mania.
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:33:22
Funny thing to say as it's falling to 12.9k
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:51:49
Or, you know, get out while you still can...
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:12:12
Bitcoin already jumped the shark late last year when it became mainstream news and the new people promptly got burned. So it probably won't be going back up much anytime soon and it could start sinking which it will anyway sooner or later. @_date: 2018-01-16 16:19:19

Sell while you still can.

I understand your pessimism right now but I don't see how it could go lower.
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:00:32
More businesses should "offer" this given nobody will actually try to use it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:45:03
Somebody who thinks they understand those words really ought to know better.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:46:44
And anyone else who doesn't like ponzi schemes.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:40:09
One thing that could be different this time is that the options market introduced in December allows betting against btc and so could encourage a longer fall.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:22:57
He already has. He has recently said he thinks it will likely go to zero which I agree with.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:34:05


Shorting anything is too risky - he said he would buy long term puts if they were available.


So it's not a bubble because it's a bigger bubble than expected?

The floor is zero.
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:58:01
Definitely. I think the much celebrated option market could actually encourage it's demise as people now have a safer way to bet against it and they could be smelling blood after tonights fall.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:35:26
The cowards and nonbelievers are the only ones who will get out with the real loot while the rest of you bravely hodl to zero.

The fees will be vastly reduced as it approaches zero. This is good for bitcoin.

Does your data include the extent to which Tether pumped bitcoin with counterfeit billions but won't be around next time?

@_date: 2018-11-19 16:24:58
Yes, you are going to lose your money.
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:39:33
Zero. And now that the shorts and futures have it by the nuts - it might get pretty close.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:09:45
The last time it crashed it was largely under the mainstream radar. This time it has imploded just after hitting mainstream news and so it brought in and promptly burned late-comers in the process. So the public view will be negative for a long time and I wouldn't be optimistic about a recovery. And now that the CFTC has jurisdiction it may be difficult for anyone else to take over the crucial pumping role that Tether had in manipulating up the price.

You can support bitcoin by shorting it thereby helping it towards its true value.
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:07:01
Look at the positives - the longer you are forced to wait the cheaper bitcoin will be.
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:32:31
The fact that it was "successfully" pumped with Tether's counterfeit billions doesn't make it an actual success - it just makes it a worse scam.
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:12:22
Except it's only about stocks so not relevant.
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:05:24
Those use a miniscule fraction of bitcoin's energy usage because they don't have thousands of nodes testing random numbers to win a dumb lottery.
