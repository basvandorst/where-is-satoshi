It happens. Welcome to trading.
I’ve been really lucky. I bought $200 worth at 15.6k just to play with it. Got scared at 17k when it peaked and dipped and expected a correction or something and dumped half of it. Got lucky again and bought back at 16.5k a day or two later when the price was cycling.
I’ve read more into it now and am deciding if I want to just hold what I have and see where this goes, cash out half again at the next high and enjoy my very minor gains while still keeping some skin in the game or fully drink the koolaid of this going to the moon and drop another $300 or so on the next correction (if that happens) or just jump in and don’t look back. 
Edit: for the sake of clarity, I’ve been very skeptically and bearishly following the btc and eth market for over a year and just never could afford to get into and frankly expected them to not really go anywhere, but with the recent spike in popularity I decided to finally jump in and play instead of sitting on the sidelines. I sincerely regret not getting in sooner, but money is tight and I’m really risk averse so I would’ve panic sold and lost it anyway, so it’s probably better this way.

Best of luck and I totally respect your commitment. 
If the past week has been any example along with all the price bloat from the people that just jumped on the ship, if there’s a sharp dip and those new buyers panic sell then you could get back on the train at a great price.

Let me know if anybody is interested in doing this! I’d be more than happy to supply the btc.
