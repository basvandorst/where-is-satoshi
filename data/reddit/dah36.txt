Does anyone have a guide to setup a lightening node. Also, can anyone do this (novice like me) or do you have to be technically gifted/savvy?
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:27:47
And can you give a relative sense of what that fee would be? For example, lets say over like a year time frame if you staked 1 btc. (I know this is almost impossible to estimate-just looking for a general range)

Can someone explain how to read/understand a depth chart on gdax?

How would you respond if someone says ethereum is ‘very decentralized’ vs bitcoin?

Is it reasonable/expected to think that all of these upgrades will be accepted by core? And if so, what would be the timeframe for a soft fork implementation of this?
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:13:54
I see. So if you had 1 btc funded on your channel, you could funnel 1btc worth of tx at a time through it, and collect a portion of those associated fees (albeit small)?
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:15:21
what is the rough time frame on this do people think?
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:04:29
Thanks. Also, what is the idea around how much btc you are willing to stake to the network? How does this work? Ie locking in 5 btc to run a node.

Amazing amount of good quality development going on right now-people should not be so worried about price in the short term.

Why the heck is bcash pumping so much...how do people not get that lightening will destroy bcash?? Its shocking to me.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:07:51
Two reasons.
1) people actually use bitcoin in many countires and often don’t mind waiting a while for confirmations. The network effect is so strong-people use what they know and are comfortable with.
2) its also possible that bch/others are sending
Spam transactions to the network just to clog mempool on purpose and try to hit bitcoin before lightening comes online and solves this all.

Does anyone have a summary/breakdown of the main points of the bitcoin whitepaper/system?
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:22:43
Why monday?

Where are people getting that LN will take two years? Whats the timeframe?

Can you explain what a sell wall/ buy wall is?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:18
Does anyone else notice the mempool starting to clear up? Then again, im not entirely sure what benchmark we are shooting for there...please correct me if im wrong  
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:29:05
Thanks for The explanation. So a ‘sell wall’ indicates enough sell orders/pressure to
Hold price at or below certain level?—in which case you would need greater buy orders to counteract this to push price up?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:09:46
They have to be doing something to expedite this rollout-i have to think core/devs are going to do something in the meantime...

@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:17
What is the ‘acceptable’ amount of unconfirmed transactions we would ideally be ok with?

Most of the liquid supply of bitcoin (not lost and not locked in cold storage) is traded either on OTC desks or electronically through a series of market making/market neutral algorithms. This type of trading exists to take profits/arbitrage/bump and run wherever it can. Because the liquid supply is so small, and this is how it is being handled, suffice it to say there are no fundamentals when it comes to this market over short time frames. 
Take the long view. Build your positions and then set it and forget it.

It’s not about “scaling”. Get a new angle you noob.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:00:45
Yes-but b cash has maintain levels at greater than 1000, i.e. it looks like its not going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:47:11
Another good buying op as usual. Buckle up though, this dip may be bumpy.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:53:19
But if it ever wants to gain even a semblance of mass adoption, it needs to have a better answer than that. 
Governments will not allow it if that type of activity
Is commonplace on the network, that, just as much as store of value is also critical for it to be 'useful'

Did anyone get a blockstream mens hoodie and if so how does the sizing run? Lol
