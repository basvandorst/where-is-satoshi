decentralized crypto-crypto exchanges, OK no problem. but how to manage FIAT-crypto in a decentralized way??
@_date: 2016-08-01 00:46:21

@_date: 2016-08-03 01:46:06
FIAT to crypto exchange and vice versa. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 14:51:27
i dont know whats the last situation on that issue, i remember researching a bit some years ago and it was at least not completely unplausible, as the only known member is Bulgarian with ties (via his father) to Russia.

why? wright seems to be a very extraordinary person with alot of money. not unusual to buy stuff not directly from the maufacturer.
@_date: 2016-04-03 12:28:48
agree, its very interesting to see how ZH manipulates its readers and those readers are also willing to get manipulated. ZH presents a headline that is nothing more than a interpretation/opinion of a Bloomberg author as if its a quote from the Wikileaks data.
But looking at the original wikileaks data its not remotely as scandalous as ZH tries to put it.
Giving the fact that ZH is said to be controlled by Russia the question who taped the conversation and leaked them to wikileaks is also very interesting. Especially given the fact that Russia has obv interests to divide europe.
@_date: 2016-04-01 01:08:54
yes, you are right it IS unusual, nevertheless nothing that "i can't believe". it's doable that's for sure.
but lets see if those keys will get signed, that's the important step.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:29:18
If i had told you that when you started crypto you most likely simply wouldn't have cared.
Over the years i tried to help lots and lots of noobs but they all seem to need to do all mistakes on their own.

And because he is a fucking asshole.
And yes it is Discrimination. Nevertheless a private company has the right to discriminate who the fuck it wants.

Hey, how's Romania doing? Do you have censorship there?
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:09:35
They don't need to because this is no public court hearing. It's a private company and they have all the right to ban any conspiracy-fuckhead they want at any time.
Stop whining.
@_date: 2018-09-22 16:30:27
LOL, you are doing a big step from "company A discriminates minority X" to "minority X won't be able to live in state X".
Who says that just because one company is discriminating all others are following? Makes zero sense from a economic perspective.
In a free market demand gets satisfied. That means if you have minority X in a City that needs apartments/whatever there will be supply.

Libertarian values means that if i built machine X i own machine X and therefore i have the right to decide who is allowed to use it and who not. As simple as that.
In a libertarian world there is no other entity (state) that decides what i am going to do with something that i own and have built from the ground.
As long as he is free to built his own service to get his word out he is maybe discriminated but not censored.
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:26:13
Over all the places on the internet, I would not bet on being unable to understand free markets.
Paypal has all the right to ban who the fuck they want.
It's funny how this sub that is always "libertarian" turns against every libertarian principle as soon as it goes against their opinion.
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:42:27
No. If i have a party at my house and you start a speech and i kick you out it's not censorship. 
Censorship is for example a state that put you into jail for saying things he doesn't want you to say. It's when the non-private actor aka state starts to force you or others.

@_date: 2018-09-22 11:48:32
As long as he is free to post his crap somewhere else or even better build his own website/whatever to get his word out i am all fine. He has no given right to use the platform someone else has built. 
If you wanna know what censorship really looks like look China. It's not a question if company A blocks you, it's a question if you are allowed to free speech.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:41:44
Yes, i am fine with that. 
Let them be known to be racists and see if anyone wants to live in apartments that are owned by a company that is known to be racist.

Why not solve the centralization issue that bigger blocks bring with incentives for fullnodes? Pay them some btc and it should work, shouldnt it? 
@_date: 2014-11-23 18:46:37
Advantage lays for biggest parts on the side of the seller/merchant and not so much on the side of the customer. Lesser fees and no chargebacks are on the positive here.
Therefor the merchants should have the drive to bring Bitcoin to the masses. With advertisement, discounts, special offers etc....
@_date: 2014-01-24 00:38:31
l am using your site and already donated some and have got some critisism/ideas
first of all i have alot of different altcoins and your dashboard overview seems to have a fixed height. that leads to lines that begin to overlay each other and very tiny graphics after several altcoins being added.
i suppose you add some scroll-down-view on the dashboard or an extra overview page or something.
next i would suppose a longterm chart of the portfolio-value.
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:28:38
So, really thats what its all about? BTChina has not enough guanxi and huobi does? And thats what makes the difference to be allowed to fund the account via wire or only via vouchers?

As long as Bitcoin cant compete to Darkcoin in terms of Anonymity its not just "another pump and dump" but has some serious undeniable advantages.
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:21:41
its just you.
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:28:18
I guess the news is that they filed for a specific amount of shares. That looks like a progress imo.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:07:05
So, the only answer you got is to ask "Who is upvoting this?" 
Darksend is undeniable an advantage over Bitcoin and it remains to be seen if Bitcoin will be able to adopt some kind of true annonymity cause it surely wont help the Foundation and others while negotiating with Gov etc.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:26:46
Ah i can see your fail now. You are right the coin launched in January, nevertheless "Darksend" wasnt incorporated until today. So you see THATS the reason for this hype and its obv a good reason to hype cause as its stands its the only Cryptocurrency that inherits this functionalty at the moment.
So we have got a real undeniable innovation here!

Actually to stop all BTC-withdraws looks like a good decision then. Thats maybe the only way they can sort the mess out from the ground.

@_date: 2014-08-19 17:43:26
Otherwise i would expect that its mich easier to keep track of fiat holdings than it is keeping track of BTCs scattered over several different cold wallet systems etc
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:10:36
Price (of both forks combined) would most likely crash. Imagine all the confusion and the public that isn't aware of the fact that BTC can split up into infinite forks at any time.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:12:45
Who says that exchanges won't offer both chains? Looking at the ETH/ETC situation there was no exchange listing ETC at first also, but then one after another added ETC.
I think it's naive to expect that big exchanges won't add a BTC fork.

Update: 
@_date: 2016-01-03 16:49:53
A well encrypted wallet doesn't solve that issue as a keylogger could be used. 
In regard to "trust your machine" i would say every machine is hackable, its just a matter of motivation.
Armory is obv very good but afaik you have to connect via a USB-stick to sign the transactions so its theoretically possible to write malware that gets onto the USB-stick and moves to your "cold"-machine and back. I know its paranoid, but its possible. ;)

@_date: 2017-04-29 10:14:28
Afaik AXA has no direct investment. It's just some connection via a fund they have invested in and this fund has a very small portion in Blockstream. In reality this mean exactly ZERO influence or interest.
People just looked for some conspiracy bullshit and found the name AXA between thousands of other connections and freaked out.
If you take a random company and look up all the owners that are indirectly owners via funds etc you will find 10s of thousands. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:20:34
true. conspiracies about blockstream are beyond bullshit.
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:11:47


Indeed, and therefore they have a big interest in Bitcoin thriving. Maybe even more than a developer with no skin in the game and just a academic interest in the whole adventure.
Edit: Doesn't mean someone specific.

@_date: 2016-02-18 22:00:34
its not about WHERE the hospitals are that they attack. its about WHAT target they have chosen. what a degenerated piece of shit do you have to be to attack a hospital??

can we please stop to post every fart that aantonop lets on twitter?
@_date: 2016-02-23 13:44:36
you didnt answer my question:
do you think it helps in the actual situation of the community to have a big contest who is the biggest asshole in online-discussions?
the fact that we see censorship on doesn't give any excuse to insult adam. also is no state that you aren't allowed to leave. you are not a jew in the warsaw ghetto. you are just in a fu**** online-forum and are allowed to leave and do your own forum at anytime you wish. so "oppressive environment" is a little ridiculous if you ask me in this context. 


no, and i didn't say so. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 21:17:10
So you are basically saying that if a statement is true or not depends on the time since registration of the author? ROFL.
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:07:16
the problem?! lol! maybe that they had to transport patients to other hosiptals? that they had to postpone important surgeries? that the overall situation had very likely bad results for the inpatients? 
lol! whats the problem? imagine you are lying there and waiting to get some serious treatment and then *boom*
@_date: 2017-04-15 19:23:49
And? That doesn't change anything regarding his statement.
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:02:06
stealing data is one thing, blocking the data is a completely different animal, as you are basically hurting the lives of patients in that particular hospital.

0.0001 fee = 4cent. thats quite a joke! if your android wallet isnt capable of offering a better fee its their fault. for a TXs of 127$ it should be OK to pay 25cent if you ask me.
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:38:27
justify what?
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:36:24
i think its more or less a random incident that they attacked the hospital, they found it in their net if you will and charged them extra.
and even if the Hospital would be overcharging their patients, why should that justify an attack that lets exactly those patients suffer a little more? that doesnt make any sense at all.
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:29:49


That comparison is inaccurate. Banks may be interested in having profits but they dont have necessarily an interest in one US-Dollar rising in value against other currencies. Thats a different playing field.
"Banks" in our little economy would be best described as the excahnges we have so far. They play in the economy but dont necessarily need a rising price of Bitcoin to make profits.
Miners on the other hand are hit hard if the price of Bitcoin falls, as they have bills in Fiat to pay that hurt them alot.


Why do you think so? Not every dev is an early adopter of Satoshi's times. Also i wouldn't underestimate the amount of Bitcoins in hands of redditors...


Not to you OK, but in open source projects you see that all the time. Developers helping projects just out of idealism. In fact its basically the normal situation.
@_date: 2016-02-21 14:39:10
agree! imo "Consensus" is utopian. we will never have everybody agreeing with a decision be it blocksize or color of GUI. there is always one miner, user, stakeholder oder developer who doesnt approve.
so you have to go forward at one moment without Consensus.
question remains, at what point do you just move on? 
@_date: 2016-02-18 22:20:40


No, its not. The act itself stays the same and the valuation of it also. Its disgusting to blackmail a hospital period.
Imagine some guy comes from the US into Russia and blackmails and tortures systematically older persons. Would you then argue: Oh look he isnt doing it in his "home country", so then its OK!
You obv would not because a crime like this crime stays disgusting no matter where you did it.


Yes but you see this isnt about information. If it would be about information then you wouldnt have to blackmail anyone. You just steal the data and sell it. But they dont! They basically brought the work of the Hospital to a stop and risked hundreds of lives including children, etc.


I dont. For them its obv a completely new situation that they will have to adapt to. You see if a person comes and sets the local kindergarden on fire i dont blame the kindergarden i blame those motherfuckers who did this.
The Hospitals will most likely start to think about IT-security in a completely different way now and thats a good thing longterm.
@_date: 2016-09-09 13:12:39
would have been much more satisfying to sue that asshole. his "i wont do it again!" is just the stuff his older brother told him to write.
honestly in the name of all those who get scammed for bitcoins all the time and have no chance of getting a grab on that asshole it would have been nice to see him digging some dirt in the municipal parks for some weeks. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:27:16
MtGox also caused the 2013 bullrun.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:33:24
It was artificially inflated and the moment the China Fud started and the bots were turned of it obv collapsed. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:32:33
Better go and learn about Willy and Markus-Bots. The 2013 bullrun was 90% MtGox-Bot driven. You can even witness dips every time the bots went offline for a short period of time.

@_date: 2017-09-29 18:45:14


Most important part: No one controls Bitcoin, except the miners.
Not any small group of corporations or developers or twitter accounts.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:36:21
Yeah exactly, if we run from 500 to 5000 we all cheer and party and if we go down from 5000 to 3500 it must be some "small group of people". LOL, the delusion.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:20:45
leave a rating at -&gt; 
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:36:53
Your "Honest miners" have 5% of hashpower, so they could reduce the diff to -5%. 
That wouldnt change much as they would still have to deal with a 95% difficulty with their minority hashpwer.
It would take several months to get to the next readjustment. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:12:34
And that's mostly likely exactly what's gonna happen.
Only some surprise hashpower could change the outcome.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:34:06
Nope, Bitcoiner since 2013. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:19:02
As you may have read we just had a conversation about hashpower and nodes and if you compare those two hashpower obv decides and not nodes.
Nevertheless you are obv correct that ultimately it's the market who decides as miners obv follow income. 
Some questions that will be answered:
How will the market value a non-functional legacy BTC-chain that will need months to readjust the difficulty?
How will the market value a possible "new" chain after a PoW change? 
How will it value a SW2X-chain? 
Also we have a nice equation here going on:
Miners follow the market, right? But also miners contribute to giving a chain it's value through security. So the market follows also hashpower.
And it's exactly THAT stuff that makes this whole drama so unpredictable and interesting from an economic, gametheory point-of-view.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:26:12
They look for size of the transaction. If you wanna cash-in 10k from Bitstamp it's no issue. If you start cashing-in 6 or even 7 digit deep a bank that was easy to deal with could change quickly.
That's imo why you have some of the split ratings. Folks with small sums say "Everything fine!" while folks with larger amounts get the red card.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:19:07
Yes, we will have to see.
Never a dull moment,heh?
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:14:00
Mate i guess you will have to learn then who has the power in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Hint: It's not the nodes..
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:50:43


Because from their point of view Bitcoin is being taken away by the current Core developer team. In their perspective they just defend the original vision of SN.
You see to solve issues like that you have to be able to understand the "other side", a closed minded and aggressive view is one of the root causes of this situation. Not some entity from outside, this is purely caused by the community itself.
@_date: 2016-10-20 00:08:46

That explains ALOT of the selling pressure imo over the last 12 months, as i expect thieves to cash out asap no matter what price.

@_date: 2015-11-01 13:46:10
The impact on bitcoin price should be limited. As far as a pyramid scheme works: new victim A buys BTC and sends them to MMM which then uses those BTC to pay the older victim B. 
So you see? Buy and Sell are closely linked to each other. How many BTC are actually hoarded remains unseen.
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:31:10
Prediction: He will move coins from block   or  and we will see the next layer of hysterical denial ramping up. "He stole them!" 
You folks have to understand that there is a part of the community (incl devs) that will fight anyone who could be Satoshi cause they are afraid they could loose some of their power over Bitcoin.

No link, but very simple to explain. UASF relies on nodes. One vote per node. But nodes are easily multiplied, you can setup thousands of nodes with not much cost and manipulate the voting process. And that's a Sybil attack.
There is a reason Bitcoin relies on POW. You can't multiply it easily with basically zero costs. Otherwise Bitcoin would rely on ProofofNode.

In a free world every exchange is free to accept and sell any coins it wants or doesnt want! And you are free to use other exchanges if you disagree!
So, absolutely no problem here.

following your logic SN would have no way to proof himself to us, cause everything could have potentially been stolen or whatever.
it would mean that the real SN would be rejected by the bitcoin community. (no matter if or nor Wright is SN)

How come that Obamas approval rating is basically shit then? I mean they are indoctrinated 24/7 right? So that should lead to big applause for him. But it doesnt.
Same goes for approval rating of the US-gov as a whole. Americans are very skeptical about their own gov. How is that possible? Does the Russian propaganda such a good work or are Russians "by nature" big believers in their leaders?
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:32:42

Gavin already mentioned that Wright explained to him very well why those time patterns emerged.

its one thing to discuss via BTT and email in a relatively calm time for bitcoin or via TV when you are basically on a center stage worldwide with fraud accusations, hackers, blackmail, police-raids and so on. its a whole different setting, alot has changed in those years and he has been attacked hard in the recent months. 
i think he fits perfectly for a genius person.

OTC is forbidden for some investors depending on state etc. Some Institutionals arent allowed to buy OTC either.

lol! why are you folks so unable to be patient for just a few days? handling those keys is obv not as easy as carrying around some random stuff on a usb. just relax and see what happens.
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:58:05
the reason is very simple. todd fears that a return of SN could cost him influence, so he will try to do his best to obfuscate any evidence. even if he brings proof of  or whatever.
you have to understand that some of the developers wont like the fact that there is a new cowboy in town... 
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:09:51
You my friend are the climax of bullshit in this sub. 
And somehow i welcome your honesty, because you clearly show that its not about evidence. Its just about personal reluctance to accept Wright as Satoshi. It doesnt matter who he is or what he does you just dont want him to be Satoshi and are therefore ignorant against any evidence that may come.
That fits perfectly the childish mood in this sub at the moment. You kids hoped for some Santa Claus and now you are facing the reality of a usual human being with all its attitudes and real life activities.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:57:40


You see that's an very important point cause you are obv reluctant to see CW as SN out of some emotion. That obv hinders any realistic view on the situation. 
Most of the community has been doing the mistake it seems to start to "believe" in SN as a kind of father-like figure and are now not able to level down a little bit and to acknowledge reality of a little bit eccentric SN.
@_date: 2015-03-15 00:28:50
The incentive to strengthen Bitcoin has to come from the MERCHANTS. Not the customers! They are the ones that will have pay less/no fees to CC/Paypal etc as they are the ones that pay them now.
Consumer Adoption will thrive if merchants start to accept BTC with a 20% discount out of their own interest.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:48:32
lol! believe me if those kiddy fights start to plunge the bitcoin price i will be ready to do what i have to do. and i wont wait until 100$ ;-)
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:43:02
exactly, which makes it no authority at all. for a real authority to happen the individual has to be without a choice, like a king in its kingdom. but as soon as you can just walk away/opt-out its no authority.
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:36:13
"They have a leader with 90% approval rating"
In an system with basically no alternative media and state indoctrination in every aspect of life, thats not very surprising. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 02:28:20
relax. the important point is that the impression is made that Gavin has been bamboozled and isnt convinced anymore that CW = SN, but thats not the case. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:03:25
lets see, maybe one can find a pattern or something.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:02:30
you are aware of that we are talkin about opensource here? there is no such thing as "authority" in opensource.
@_date: 2016-05-05 01:51:00
funny because Gavin lets no word of being "bamboozled" in any way. he just says he regrets to going public before Wright brought his proof of ownership. thats all.
@_date: 2016-05-05 02:39:53
i think it will all solve itself eventually the coming days. should Wright sign those keys alot of pressure is gone from Gavin.
@_date: 2015-11-01 16:50:05
Like i said in post  The amount of hoarded coins is unknown. I think that they keep some BTC for themselves. Sure they do! But is it 1% of all their revenue or 5%,10% ? Who knows. Also keep in mind that only a fraction of their revenue is actually in BTC. Also its no sure that they would sell their hoarded BTC once this ponzi collapses. 
People are not "leaving" the ponzi, they are being rewared with money from newcomers. Thats the reason it gets more and more complicated to satisfy older victims. Its exponential. So new coins go straight to the exchange again and are being sold. Like i said the only really interesting part are the coins they keep for themselves, but thats just a fraction of a fraction.

@_date: 2016-05-02 17:20:23
i agree 100% that there are simpler ways that he should be able to do.
i disagree on knowing how SN would behave. its one thing to be able to so it and another thing to actually do it this way.
its quite possible that SN is an eccentric "nerd" that tries to do things in a more complicated way then necessary. after all we know SN is a genuis and they are very seldom behaving "normal" ;)
but i agree without proof of the first blocks its not enough. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:40:44
lol! didnt you just claim that Putin isn't bombing hospitals? so you see, you were wrong about that. thats all, i just wanted to help you to get a better understanding of whats going on.
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:32:21
i bet that even if he shoots there will be trashtalk that its not SN. you can see already how folks are preparing themselves for such a case. i read alot these days that even if those coins get moving or a message is signed it doesnt mean anything jada jada jada...
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:37:56
me too, but you can expect that for example if he just signs with  there will be lots and lots of idiotic talk about "without genesis he isnt satoshi" and if he brings the genesis the next step will be "he stole the keys"
just look around several devs already stated even genesis block would not be enough.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:38:06
And how do you define this unit called "user"? What exactly is "1 User"?

Who says that the blockchains will be tied to the main blockchain? As i see it they seem to be planning their own thing.
@_date: 2015-11-01 16:04:56
oh they for sure are hoarding some BTC for themselves. nevertheless to get this scheme going you have to spend new coins for old victims.  
also its not guaranteed that once it all crashes MMM sells those BTC.

Also there are pools of money that dont want to buy BTCs on some shady exchange.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:43:56


not necessarily. there could be a bunch of risks in doing so, be it tax-authorities or security concerns or whatever. its certainly not a definite deduction.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:53:33
thats satoshi, deal with it.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:33:19
mix of keys = yes
understanding = he already showed deep knowledge on several bitcoin debates, i recommend the discussion between him and Szabo
being in the right place at the right time = lol! what is that? being in Japan in 2008 or what?
social confirmation = nobody interacted directly face to face with SN, so there no possibilty for the real SN to proove him this way


If thats your opinion then the "real SN" would have no way ro proove himself and would be (falsely) rejected by the community.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:01:08


Here you are making a logical mistake, yo assume to know how SN would or would not behave, but on what base? 
people have to get rid of their dream SN and start to accept at least the POSSIBILITY that SN isnt the holy figure they are all imagining.

yeah, that would be the next step in the paranoia. "he isnt satoshi! he *ç%&amp;( satoshi!" 
that guy has prooven before that he has a very deep understanding of bitcoin and the technology behind it, i remember a discussion with Nick Szabo and Wright were Szabo seemed deeply impressed by Wright.
if he brings crytographic proof he IS Satoshi.

@_date: 2016-05-04 00:16:56
its not about CW being SN or not, i was just pointing out that while "refusing to believe something" you are obv hindering yourself in coming to an completely rational outcome.
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:58:17
AFAIK he tried to build a system like Bitcoin before SN did, but he failed. so now he hates BTC cause SN succeeded in what he was't capable of.

lol, talks about "bubble" and believes conspiracy shit...
and btw who exactly is that "we" you are talkin of? are you a medieval king or something? 
step out of your bubble and have a look and learn that the FED is controlled by nothing else than the Department of Finance of the USA. They decide who is the chairman and they decide who is the next chairman, so THEY are in control. meaning its no one else as the Gov. but i guess thats too much reality for some foggy conspiracy theorist brain. ;)
@_date: 2016-07-28 12:52:44
a.) nobody "controls the world" thats just crap in your lunatic-head
b.) we (as a bitcoin-community) dont want to "control the world"
c.) learn who controls the FED. (hint, its NOT Rothschild and other crap your conspiracy friends told you)
