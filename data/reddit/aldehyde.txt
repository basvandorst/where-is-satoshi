Not the fault of bitcoin protocol, just the fault of the community for trusting and "investing" in an obvious ponzi scheme.
Guys. MAGIC THE GATHERING online exchange. Holy shit.

 It would have been easy for them to change the name of the company to something more respectable/not associated with card games. If they want to be serious that is, and clearly they don't. Since they just scammed everyone out of almost half a billion dollars.
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:59:34
what a fucking joke lol, anyone who would willingly give these incompetent boobs money deserves what they get.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:17:19
that half billion came from somewhere, you can pretend that no one used Mt Gox but it was the most in-the-news exchange and had a ton of volume.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:52:06
not with terrible, immature staff who steal money, but I mean, normally a reputable financial business would not be associated with magic cards.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:37:19
its definitely not 11 million dollars a day, and that figure for bitcoin only increases over time and with more use.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:19:51
we just need a distributed array of amateur exchanges run by teenagers and pedophiles
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:28:04
nope just makes me lol that this entire community is full of people who just want to blindfold themselves and invest in pretend money. i'd feel more secure 'investing' in DLC for Train Simulator 2013.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:50:38
the opportunity to turn your money into 38% less money, amazing!
doesn't it cost like $11 million dollars a day in electricity/other resources to sustain bitcoin? lol.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:05:27
lol this guy is cool as heck
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:45:15
yeah all the people running the exchanges and other infrastructure are totally trust worthy and theres no history of ponzi schemes and hacks in the bit coin community lol
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:26:43
yes but why would a trend line based on 3 days of historical value be any more accurate of an estimate than a random guess when the value of bitcoin has increased 500% in the last month?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:40:14
i didn't know i needed to be invited to i thought this community was all about freedom??

"Mt Gox. Twitter: Maintenance Over however we are now under a DDoS attack."
you believe them? lol. they've just been saying whatever they can to keep this ponzi scheme rolling.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:30:27
lmao what 'institutional buy up?' no respectable institution gonna buy butt coins
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:48:28

@_date: 2013-04-11 04:45:34
prove it then
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:22:53
guys I think what they're trying to say is bitcoins are WORTHLESS, get out while you still can !!!
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:23:21
does anyone know of hostels in the cleveland area that take bit coins? I gambled and lost everything I own and can only stay here until friday.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:35:56
yeah man i do all that shit
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:14:54

@_date: 2013-04-11 22:56:51

@_date: 2013-04-12 02:20:32
i was mislead and manipulated by mt gox and the bitcoinc ommunity some one will be held responsible
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:43:00
bahahahah yeah great anecdote. bitcoin lost 40% of its value today, you should probably post a lil mea culpa here.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:52:06
Ride the bitcoin rollercoaster! tick tick tick tick tick tick WhoaaaaOHHHHHHH AHHH AHAHAHA AHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:34:03
okay sure, heres a plot starting in september 2012: 
does this look like less of a bubble to you??
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:26:20
no problem
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:24:27
I've heard rumors about a class action law suit against Mt Gox, does anyone know anything about this? I never knew about the risk of bit coin and dont know what I am going to do. I sent an email to NASDAQ but have only gotten a form reply so far.

wow great response. the biggest exchange is totally full of shit but its cool cause you don't use them, this whole subreddit should just be folded into @_date: 2013-12-07 03:54:29
yeah duh cmon guys
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:10:24
I didn't register for classes this semester and spent all of my money on bit coins. I really don't know what I'm going to do now, I've lost $25,000 so far....
edit: students spendning their student loans on bit coins right here. My parents think I'm at Johns Hopkins but I'm staying at my friends house until friday. Not sure where I'm going after that.
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:31:25
its not just speculation and volatility, exchanges are getting shut down for not complying with US regulations etc. they aren't going to buy up tons of bit coins when there is so much risk.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:14:38
i really doubt it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:21:22
no its direct evidence that the people running this stuff are amateurs and totally unprofessional. having redundant DNS and an infrastructure without a single point of failure has nothing to do with 'being in it for the money.'
if they were in it for the money they would provide a more secure, reliable service.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:14:51
looks like someone is a late adopter
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:48:37
did you get her from the shelter?
