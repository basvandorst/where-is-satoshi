It's pretty simple from the data center side of this. Rent + power+internet=cost.
Rent is computed by the Kw. 2300 watts= 2.3KW. 10 of these per rack = 23Kw/rack. Unless the facility was built in the past 4 years you will get jacked on cooling upcharges to deal with that much heat (7843 BTU which is an oven on medium).
Said another way, most data centers were designed for a RACK at 2.3Kw, not a single piece of computing equipment. Fire danger is added on top of it. You can always find ghetto colo out there - just means your stuff may get too hot and shutdown.
The formula to figure out is how many gigahashes = how many bitcoin, and how many kw=gigahash. Factor in the cost of power and you'll see what it costs and how to make money (or not)
My back of the napkin is a 23kw cabinet will cost you $2500/month in rent. Another $900/month is electricity at 5 cents per kwh. $3,300/month, no labor or equipment. Ten Teraminers (one cabinet) at $60k with a lease factor over 5 years is another $1,120/month.
We're at $5320/month for a cabinet of TeraMiners (as an example). If the value of bitcoin craters, or ASICS double every 6 months then it takes you longer to break even so the only way to do it is to do it at scale which creates problems stemming from concentration of processing power and centralizes production like a Mint.
Short term gain is possible, long term it must be done at scale, and the risks grow with new ASICS and imploding value. I think the odds of Peyton Manning winning a Superbowl are more favorable. At least today...
