I'm afraid for the first time. Isn't OB essentially a version of silkroad ? That was shutdown over and over again? I don't think it's good to be able to buy or sale ANYTHING anonymously on the internet. And since gov's can't shut it down/control it they might ban the use of bitcoin altogether. I see ob as something dangerous, illegal and a threat to bitcoin. tell me if i'm wrong..
Of course if we'll use it as an alternative to Amazon/ ebay it would be a fantastic thing, but let's not kid ourselves.

How much news about crypto are there in saudi ?   
I think you only hear and read what Mr. Saud want you to hear and read.

I think any government would care a lot about crypto, and how it's used by the people - especially slightly dictatorial ones who impose more rules than average on its citizens. . The reason many governments don't ban crypto is because its very hard to do so from a technical perspective, and - it would be regarded as an oppressive, 3rd world country measure . Looks like in SA it is not illegal - tbh I am from an EU country and the bank closed my account because I bought some crypto.. so I'm not implying  SA is bad or anything.
   My question was just out of curiosity .. I would have found it interesting if bitcoin and crypto are mentioned a lot in saudi media.

In ~2010 when I heard about Bitcoin, I installed the miner and let it mine few hours. When I wanted to play Fifa, I saw I couldn't because the PC was slow af. 
  Then I checked to see how much money I made, and it was few bitcoins worth under 0.20 $. I said fuck it, deleted the miner and the wallet and play some games.

After my bank unilaterally closed my account and invited me to withdraw all my money  from them ( Intesa SanPaolo ) because I traded with bitcoin, I made an account on Fidor Bank (its an Internet bank in Germany) .
Although its all in german and I don't understand german, its very easy to use it. No need to go to Germany, you can make an account and get verified remotely. Extremely low fees, and most importantly this is the bank Kraken use , so when I withdraw or deposit from Fidor to Kraken , it takes 1 minute - I was amazed by this. 
Maybe its not suitable for non-eu Residents tho, im not sure about the legislation .
All bank and political parties against new technology will slowly but surely die. We should do all we can to speed up this process.

Closed - I had money, they gave me some time to withdraw it .

That's what I also believed, that we live in a moral, law abiding society - but apparently not, they just informed me unilaterally that they will close the account and have a few days to withdraw the money .
Person at the bank told me bitcoin is unregulated , so not legal or illegal - what can I say i went with it. 
After some digging I found out that also other major banks are closing accounts, in many countries.

Is there a major bank that is crypto-friendly ? 
I live in an EU country and IntesaSanPaolo bank just closed my bank account without any reason (an employee there told me unofficially they are closing all accounts related to crypto . My transaction were pretty small.
