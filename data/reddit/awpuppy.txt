And that would be something to look down on me for if I had autism?  Whats next, you going to call me gay?  Keep beating around the bush instead of looking at what you advised.  Unless you edited it, this whole thing started when you bashed someone for warning others not to keep their btc in an exchange because it is unsafe.  In todays current environment, that is correct but you can keep beating around the bush, we all must be illiterate and have autism if we disagree with you.  What ever helps you sleep at night.

So far the more bitcoin goes down the more his shitcoin and every other coin goes down.  He's cutting his nose to spite his face, what a nutcase.  Can't let bcash stand on it's own merits so he wants to self destruct crypto keep trying to create a loss of confidence out of spite.

So once lightning rolls out, if we can quickly get an ease of use for transactions, that's more secured than keeping it on people's cell phones, then boom, its better than credit cards right?  My biggest worry is people holding bitcoin on their phones from wallets to exchanges.  Can't any hacker gain access to it then?  I have a hard wallet of course but that doesn't have the ease of use and guarantee as credit cards that are willing to refund a fraudulent purchase these days.

This is just mind numbing!  People look at ROI (Return on Investment) and you'd be lucky to get anywhere near 10% return without owning a business.  To invest in bitcoin over 10k and make over 10% return is nothing short of a financial victory probably over any other investment out there short of owning a business.  I am talking 10% a year and yet here I bought more when bitcoin dipped into the 12k range recently.
You sound like a little kid that believe the investment world is all about buying cheap lottery tickets over and over.  That's called gambling.  Go ahead and Keep at it at the casino, waiting for that permanent vacation of yours!

As far as I understand you don't open your own channel which is the whole point of it.  You find one that is open so for that one time $10 fee you can have who knows how many transactions before it hits the block.  
Edit:  Somewhat relevant  
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:16:05

I guess it could be both no?  Or would they always need some fee's to have a business in the first place thus lightning on bitcoin should be cheaper no matter what?  It will just need more ease of use to match credit cards once it's ready?

Is there anything from your testing that makes you say it'snot ready for mainstream yet?  I mean I'm sure it's not otherwise it wouldn't be on testnet, but just wondering due to the way you said that.  No merchants accepts it because it's still alpha or just went beta?  Can't remember.

When it is fully ready all that is left is costlier alternatives.  It's being tested and retested as we speak.  Cost is obviously less.

I put my bitcoins into a hard wallet the day my balance showed 0 on coinbase.

I couldn't find their help support for the life of me even though it said it was FDIC insured.

this is a beautiful retrace, this pattern is seen time and again, it even has room to go further down to become that much more pretty.  The bull market is inevitable, this is where nearly all the holders are left, and when only the holders are left not willing to sell, then the price soars because it'll be that much harder for a buyer to find a seller.  It's just doing it's thing, same old tale, time and again.

For  I'd imagine that's where an exchange can come in to take advantage of the offer and make it all work more efficiently.  If you use an exchange that partners with the card and the merchant uses it as well.  It's a win win for all parties.  Incentives for the credit card to be taken up, the merchant to save vs what he'd have to give up with other typical credit card fee's, and the exchange has an incentive for more users to get on board to take advantage of the easy to use credit card that can use your bitcoin.  
Honestly idk why exchanges haven't reached out and made deals with big companies where if a costumer uses that exchange they can buy products from this company, the bitcoin doesn't really have to move, it just gets cashed out for the company.  I would imagine you wouldn't necessarily even need lightning for that kind of partnership.

I just don't think the people they interviewed/got their information from have the same level of vision and understanding of it's potential, and can express it in the clear and direct eye opening way someone like Andreas could who got me and so many others into bitcoin.  I haven't heard their latest talks on it yet, I can only hope that's changed.  Before all I heard from them was speculation on price and very little on how it really worked because the guy was afraid of going too deep into the rabbit whole he kept saying.  But it just seemed like the host had more and more questions at the end of it, where-as when I saw video's of Andreas talking to law makers in Canada and Australia, he really opened their eyes to it's possibilities as a technology that can help everyone and not just make some filthy rich who got in first.  The narrative has been hijacked entirely with speculation on it's price and only it's price.  Barely anything on it's potential as a technology.

I think you're not paying attention :(  Nothing I say will convince you, so all I can say is wait and see.  
I will say this, Lightning Network has never been closer to completion than it is today, don't know how you can be so easily persuaded otherwise when it's had successful test cases all month and a successful case on the main network.  To ignore such clear and real examples tells me your letting propaganda warp your reality.  So, let the new year commence :)

Look right now it is consolidating between certain area's. You can see right under 13k there is massive support and even I bought in the last time to round out one of my bitcoins.  So it's supported but doesn't have much reason to grow yet, it's kinda found it's footing so it's consolidating around say 13-15k.  But, ETF's are on the way, more countries are beginning to draft laws to legalize trading, and lightning network is on track plus the big exchanges are trying to batch their transactions now and implement segwit.  So there's is plenty potential on the up side for 2018 and massive support just below us.  Keep calm because this is when weak hands get shaken out and the holders are left.  When the holders are left then during the next big phase up there is that much less people willing to sell, thus the price goes up that much faster :-)   
Seasoned traders are actually buying the dip and holding out, I'm talking big fund managers, old hedge fund managers, not to mention all of the development around bitcoin.  It's not going anywhere, there is so much vested interest in it and so many companies built around it working out, including multiple companies working on lightning network.  They have much more skin in the game, you're just along for the ride not really doing anything besides a little risk, so sit back and enjoy!

Don't do this, this is what creates a bubble.  Only risk what you are willing to lose, I say this with sincerity because when you have a monthly bill to pay your hands are weak, literally.  You may need to sell even if you don't want to.  Be careful with this, bitcoin will go up either way if you really believe what you believe right, so no need to risk it all, just wait another year instead and take it easy.  If you do this, do not put it ALL into btc, like i said, why not just wait a little longer and risk a little less?   What have you to loose? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:08:03
Doesn't it cost merchants money each time they accept a credit card?  With lightning it wouldn't so a new credit card wants to expand it's usage, it lets merchants accept bitcoin free with lightning and people take up their offer, because it's free!  Now the credit card can still offer credit and still make money that way and merchants everywhere may as well accept it because it's free, so it becomes a quick household name accepted everywhere.  I mean what merchant wants to loose what is it 5% when accepting credit cards?  Now they'd have a card that has practically no fee's if one took it up.

They have already implemented Segwit, the twins also actively support bitcoin and staked their fortune on it.  As far as I know they are very trustworthy and haven't had any eyebrow raising issues to date.  It seems they will be implementing important bitcoin updates well before coinbase while coinbase pulls these surprise stunts like they did yesterday for monetary gain because the CEO said he supported Ether as the top crypto in his last interview, so he has personal gain in bitcoins woes unlike the Gemini twins who have stakes their own fortunes with bitcoin aligned with Andrea's vision.  
Edit:  On top of this, coinbase said segwit is pretty much their last priority while Gemini already has it implemented.  If you would like to see progress and fixes towards bitcoins high fee's then enough people have to start using an exchange that supports such fixes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:51:33
Sure let me see.  I don't work for them I'm just glad to support them at this point.  
Gemini’s real-time, dynamic maker-taker fee schedule provides an institutional-grade trading experience that allows market participants to be charged as low as a 0 bps (0.00%) fee on all liquidity-making trades and be charged as low as a 10 bps (0.10%) fee on all liquidity-taking trades.


Your fee rate for each trading pair is determined by your gross trading volume for that trading pair over a 30 calendar day trailing window. Your fee rate for each trading pair will be recalculated every day at midnight UTC (7:00 p.m. EST/8:00 p.m. EDT) and applied to all your trades going forward from that time.


We calculate fees as a fraction of the notional value of each trade (i.e., price × amount). We use units of basis points (“bps”), which represent 1/100th of a percent of notional value. For example, a fee of 25 bps means that 0.25% of the denominated value of the trade will be kept by our exchange, either deducted from the gross proceeds of a trade or charged to the account at the time a trade is executed. Any fees will be applied in real-time at the time a trade is executed. For partially filled orders, only the executed portion is subject to trading fees.


Every trade on a continuous order book involves two orders: one that provides liquidity to the order book, and another that removes liquidity from the order book. For a buy or sell order to provide liquidity, it must first be posted to the order book. This means that it doesn’t fill immediately since it doesn’t match with and trade against an existing order; instead it must rest on the order book until another order matches and trades against it. This kind of buy or sell order adds liquidity to the marketplace and is called liquidity-making1 — the customer who places it is referred to as a maker. On the other hand, a buy or sell order that immediately matches with and trades against an existing order on an order book removes liquidity from the marketplace and is called liquidity-taking — the customer who places it is referred to as a taker. Because liquidity-making orders do not fill immediately and, therefore, bear more market risk, they receive greater incentives.


The base fee for all liquidity-making and liquidity-taking trades for each trading pair is 25 bps (0.25%); however, your fee rate for each trading pair is determined by your gross trading volume  on both the continuous and auction order books for that trading pair over a 30 calendar day trailing window.
There is more on that page, some tables and all.

Good for you.  So you want to hold the whole amount you have?  I would recommend transferring some around since if it was basically free from the fork, you can cement the gains in other crypto's and even add to your bitcoin position while leaving some in bcash and see where it goes if you want to move any more over to bcash, but up to you, good luck!

Big players will use it to hedge.  Spread the word?  Why are you spreading words about simple concepts you don't understand!  Big money wants to keep their money, that's their number one goal, they can't go in a risky environment without hedging their bets.  This will give them the opportunity.  This will create a floor, or safety net, where if one goes down, the other goes up.  They want to be apart of this market and growth, but need security from forces outside of their control like random announcements that create a huge selloff.  By being able to short bitcoin, they can invest in it, and short a certain percentage of their investment in case it does indeed tank.  
Futures allows people to invest in REAL BITCOIN more safely than without it.  Stop fear mongering!

When someone is trying to mislead me into buying one stock over the other just from a confusion in it's name, and that someone happens to have the domain name for the stock I'm looking for then yeah I'd probably fall for it.  In all likelihood I would have NO REASON not to trust that website because it happens to be THE website for the stock I'm looking for.
The bitcoin website is telling me there is bitcoin cash and bitcoin core, bitcoin cash is default, why would I NOT trust that is the bitcoin I am looking to get?  Yet I would be at fault for being mislead??  He has the damn domain name while supporting an alt coin.  Let's agree to the most simple and obvious facts here or we can't get anywhere.

Trump won for better or worse (clearly worse) due to our systems of checks and balances.  If a democracy is unchecked then the minorities voice is silenced.  Due to our electoral process giving all states a voice (not just ones with the most crowded population) Trump won :-/   
Bush stole the election though, that was just corruption. 
Edit:  Interesting, just curious, exactly why am I getting downvoted?  Want to change to vote count?  Cause honestly I kinda do.  Depending on where you live you don't get much of a say, but if every vote counted...I guess there's a trade-off to everything.

@_date: 2017-12-30 22:55:22
Lets face it, this is how everyone was before they learned a thing or two about it.  Once another use-case comes along and institutional money see the value in it, it'll be easier for others to trust and feel safe investing, in my humble opinion anyway.  
I think eventually if it continues to rise in price people will start looking into it more and more, hopefully beyond the news cycle FUD!

A deflationary currency like this if it doesn't collapse the stats will work for you over time just by hodling.  But you are breaking the statistical advantage every time you move, because you never know if that is the time it will move up to another level and never look back, it's happened multiple times already.  It's very hard to find a statistical edge.  This one's built in.  Always remember nothing is 100% certain but the edge is there over time just from holding.

I got confused because now it shows bcash value as the original 3,000 that it seemed to have started with, unless that is a coincidence and it hit 8k and is now back down to 3k?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:03:32
I thought it was pegged to 2% of bch or something.  Sorry my apologies, just very confused this whole day, it seemed when ever btc went up a little, so did bch, and vice versa, then I see posts saying they were pegged to each other.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:41:27
I don't have all my eggs in one basket.  The last time I added to my position though was at 8k and I was still shy of my goal for bitcoin but either way I was happy.  This allowed me just...almost...a little short of my goal but more than close enough, I can happily say I'm all set now.  I didn't hit that perfectly round number I was looking for but close enough, I now have more than enough to sit back and read the latest bitcoin development news!

I can't put into words...Andreas is my hero!  Him and Elon Musk have made me feel so lucky to be alive today!  I can't recommend his video's and talks enough to anyone remotely interested in bitcoin.  I think he was the reason Canada and Australian government became really open minded towards bitcoin because before his talks I think they were under this impression that it was mainly for money laundering, but he changed everything, and you could see the massive respect they had for him!  He deserves it, like I said I can't even put into words, he deserves so much of the credit for the growth of bitcoin, it was definitely his words that made me a hodler, and made me view it in an entirely new light beyond speculation!  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:36
That's awesome, the twins deserve so much more recognition!  They have actually gone out there in support of bitcoin where-as the coinbase CEO seems to support alt coins and mentioned Etherium overtaking bitcoin.  I love Etherium but it was not meant as a store of value, I value the twins and Andreas's vision much more and I am saddened I didn't support Gemini earlier but so glad this opened my eyes!  And finally, Segwit support!!

Just set up an account!  This might be a blessing in disguise, I love those two guys and want to support them the way they have been supporting bitcoin!  Didn't realize they had a good stable platform since I've heard horror stories of all the other exchanges.  I'll be happy my fees are going to those two because they seem to support bitcoin a lot more than the coinbase CEO.  I am grateful to coinbase for what they accomplished but I think competition between exchanges is extremely important here after the fiasco that went on yesterday!

The same pump happened yesterday and look at the result, bitcoin ended up shooting back up against all the sales and bcash had to be shut down.  It's the same pump and dump tactic, and speculators are trying to get in before the open, but lets see what happens.  I barely have any bcash, i honestly don't know where it came from, it says it was deposited on the 14th, no idea how or why, but I'm going to sell the first chance I get.  Would rather put it into another alt coin if not bitcoin.  The fiasco with bcash disgusts me, I share the same feelings as the litecoin developer and wow was he lucky to sell all of his at 5k.  He sold the first chance he got!

It is at the cusp of something spectacular.  It was not ready to scale to such an extent but lightning network will make transactions practically free!  Just imagine you have security, anonymity, decentralized AND just around the corner practically free instant transactions.  It will be worth the wait.  The demand hit before it was ready but let it complete it's testing on the test network and it will be revolutionary!  Right now it is a store of value seemingly more than anything, a bet on the technology to come.  It is still in the early stages that hasn't changed, it's just been a surge of demand that would have brought the same issue to any other alt coin.

As far as first world countries are concerned cryptocurrency in general are tools that haven't come out yet in the sense that they aren't easy to use as currency (certainly not easier than credit cards, in which case whats the point?).

I clicked deposit and was then able to transfer my funds from coinbase.  I clicked stop, clicked the closest price usd in red in the order book.  Then clicked the balance I had.

Gold is a store of value with a market cap in the trillions. Bitcoin is an even easier store of value, thus at 100,000 it is still a fraction of the market cap of gold...ergo undervalued!  Tadaaa!

If it takes over then there will be a loss of confidence i bitcoin entirely.  If people just jump from one coin to another then everyone who argued it's the blockchain that matters and everything else is a bubble would be spot on, and then it's worth nothing again because everyone losses confidence, and we're screwed!

Ah ok thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:44
Wow what kind of misleading analysis this is!  There was a huge sell wall yesterday, when bcash began bitgoin not only held strong but gained momentum right back to 17k when it withstood the coordinated sells that touched 14k.  Where in the world do you get 11 to 10k after a day like yesterday!?  Just as bcash was pumped yesterday, it will be pumped today before it re-opens, but there is an incredible amount of people waiting to sell as soon as they are allowed, including me.  Right now there are likely a good amount of people nervous of the volatility to come and want to secure their holdings until things settle down but if yesterday was any hint bitcoin can rest easy.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:57:05

Fingers crossed, that's actually a good thing in my opinion, means they are flooded with demand.  I think people are willing to give them time, we all know crashes during a surge is normal and will get handled.  I don't consider that to be anything sketchy or dishonest on their end.

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:32:58
If it goes to bcash, it would play out in a loss of confidence wouldn't you think?  I mean to just switch from one dominant crypto store of value to another, wouldn't that defeat the purpose of a good store of value?

I still remember how he clearly tried to shame Andreas and mislead the news into saying bitcoin.com was one of the original bitcoin owners and decided to sell all his bitcoin, are you kidding me, this has all gone too far.

Currently it's market cap is much to small for it to be a currency.  It has to be a proper store of value with a much bigger market cap and settle down it's volatility in order for it to become a stable currency, no?

But is it still possible to loose ur money from the confusion.  What if you didn't know whether the bitcoin you have is bitcoin core vs bitcoin cash, and it made it seem heavily like bitcoin cash was the default bitcoin.  Can you still retrieve your bitcoin from that kind of mistake?  
Edit:  And how are new people that just bought bitcoin supposed to know the difference if the wallet itself is trying to make it seem like bitcoin cash is the default bitcoin everyone is talking about that futures trading is going to go off of.  Can you see the room for enormous error.

There is a huge sell wall for bch right now as soon as it allows trading and it's executed, there will be a lot of coins freed up to go to btc/alt coins/or cashed out.  Given the environment, I think most will want to put some if not all to support btc.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:51
Somehow I only have $50 dollars, and I'd rather put that in any other altcoin if not bitcoin, it's barely anything since I bought the majority of my bitcoin after August but I want no part of this impostor.  If it was an altcoin it would be one thing, but the tactics they are pulling has crossed the line.  
Edit:  I say somehow because I honestly don't know where it came from?  Really odd but I don't care how or where it came from I just want to sell.  Wonder if anyone else has some unexpected bcash in their coinbase account.  I had move all my bitcoin to trezor long ago so idk where this came from, some kind of promotion from coinbase or something?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:45:47
Correct me if I'm wrong, even though the coins are yours, when you've spent on lightning, you can't spend that same coin again, it's there for all to see as if it was in the main block chain.  There's no reneging.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:44:09
Yeah when it rose passed 10 to 11 there was all sorts of nose, even Mike Novagratz sold and then it shot up to 15, to 19, and back to 16-17 down to 15.  With your easy prediction why wouldn't you have sold at 11-12 and missed out on the rest of the rise?  You're way can potentially miss out on big moves just as likely as it can miss the falls.  When I bought again at 8k my brother said I was crazy that it will definitely fall and retrace, never did, broke through 11, kept going up and even now has settled well passed it.  If it's truly so easy, you would be the richest man in the world, so stop kidding yourself.

Honestly where does it even hint with the work they are doing that it will benefit those entities, how did segwit benefit those entities because isn't that the main point of contention between big blocks vs more efficient methods such as segwit and 2nd layer solutions before raising block size? 
Edit:  And please find an actual ounce of proof to your accusations, just because bankers use shoes doesn't mean the creator of footwear did anything at their behest.

What do you mean by limiting to sending money from one user to another?  This is what I understand of lightning network:   
It seems anyone can hop on board the lightning network as it finds the fastest routes between all users, each network is not just limited from one user to one other before it closes.

I thought I could learn to trade in the fx market.  Had some simple strats that worked for months.  I thought wow, this is incredible, was up a lot.  Then consolidation happened.  Had to pull out when I lost 25k.  If I had given up on investing then, I would never have bought bitcoin at 4k or so.  Bought a little more at 8k.  Still holding.  Currently pretty much doubled my loss in the fx market.  You're still young, live and learn.  And when you invest, don't have weak hands, market conditions always change.  I stayed cool during China's ban and I'm staying cool during this consolidation period.  Put in what you're willing to loose again and don't move it.  Cars are nothing but depreciating liabilities unless you use it as a Taxi.  You'll live just fine and happy without a new car, and years from now when that car would have lost the majority of it's value anyway you'll look back and think how funny it was that you worried back then about buying a new car.  
Edit:  Another thing, you can't time the market.  When you put in, expect for it to go down, and if it goes up you got lucky and it'll go down eventually.  Look at how that post with the grandpa that bought at 9k aged.  Guess where the market went when that meme was originally posted..
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:04:33
How in the world are banks going to manipulate this sphere?  Even China couldn't successfully manipulate it in their efforts to ban it (edit: and at the time, their users did the majority of the transactions if I'm not mistaken).  
A second layered protocol is universally agreed upon as the better solution, but one could argue due to greed bitcoin cash supporters are not willing to be patient.  
Bitcoin ATM's are suffering due to bitcoins popularity, if another altcoin including bcash made it on the world stage their blocks would instantly fill up just the same.  It's not just that this is far from an elegant solution, it's ultimately unmanageable.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:57:06
I mean it would turn back into bitcoin at the speed of light...if I understand it correctly?  Wouldn't that mean it's value is retained as bitcoin?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:07:34
Doesn't bitcoin have to go up very high to become stable, it's cap isn't even in the trillions yet.  So in order for it's features to be usable, people have to hold long enough for it to gain it's value beyond the typical volatility of the markets, just like other foreign exchange currency.  
@_date: 2018-09-11 13:47:23
Except Roger got absolutely demolished by Jimmy so if anything it why bitcoin is different from all of the alt coins and centralized forks.
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:55:02
Don't give bitcoin away.  It is too early for that as people need to understand it and how to keep it safe.  It will likely get scammed away, lost in limbo, or it will put people away because it might cost them more than they imagined since they don't yet know how to use lightning (although right now that doesn't seem to be a problem at all with batching and segwit in full force, not to mention the incredible network and hashing power bitcoin has).  Give away information and then you can give bitcoin when they are ready to safely use it or store it.

Because until it finds its proper value it's not stable enough to be used as a currency the higher the value the more stable it gets. Once we finally solve this more companies can actually accept Bitcoin because there won't be such a massive price fluctuation.

Bitcoin ETF's will come in other countries anyway so why not here?  People can invest by themselves but should have the option to invest with a tax incentive through their 401k.  It's done for everything else why should bitcoin not be in a level playing field.  
If there is a fork the owner is or should be owed both coins and it should be up to them to decide what to do.  If there is a tax incentive they probably wouldn't even be able to sell either fork without paying taxes on it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:34:17

@_date: 2018-08-03 00:43:39
I've heard stories of people assuming bcash is just a cheaper bitcoin so they buy more bcash than bitcoin hoping it'll go up stronger since it has the illusion of having more room to grow.  Right now without institutional investors, there is a lot of money in crypto from people who don't do their homework hoping to ride the next wave.  Before I became a bitcoin maximalist I did this with Etherium. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:06:46
Ah ok, thanks!  And yeah I fully agree Bitcoin needs to be easier to use and I don't think that it should be through an app over the phone because a phone is so insecure as is.  But in order for it to be used there needs to be a reason to use it.  Until companies except it and/or even provide an incentive to use it, why would anyone want to pay capital gains using it.  For companies to accept it, it can't have this massive price fluctuation and I think the only solution to that is for bitcoin to be worth far far more than it is now so the fluctuations in price stabilize with it's growth and more long term investors.  It's the Chicken or the Egg, which will come first.  I think in order for a use case and the need for better easier to use wallets, price has to stabilize enough for companies to except it, thus the need for an ETF or long term stable investors and not this ridiculous gambling we've seen from people that can't hold an investment for over a few months let alone years.

@_date: 2017-08-27 00:00:41
Thank you for this!  I honestly still don't feel comfortable holding the money myself.  If I loose something or break something, I fear I loose it all.  So if it went under, if my money was in Bitcoin/Lite with them or Etherium, I would lose that money?  So that FDIC insurance is entirely misleading..
Edit:  To paint a more broad picture, on the one hand there are positives that you mentioned, on the other hand, if most people do this whats aren't they left vulnerable to someone incentivized to break into your home with the intent of doing you harm unless you give them your fortune.  Even if the money/crypto currency is secure since it wouldn't be at a centralized secure facility...well...your not as impenetrable as the currency itself right?  
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:38:41
Thank you, that's a good point!  It's something I will consider.
Back to the question real quick though, I checked on the website again:  










 








Isn't it saying that digital currency is also insured with that top paragraph?  And then separately, Fiat Currency is insured as well?  I think it's still a plus if it's insured just like a bank, so people still have choices.  Especially those new to this not sure how safe it is without the insurance early on.  Like I said I am still hesitant and would feel much safer at this point at least to keep it centralized, secured, but worst case like with banks, insured up to $250k.
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:43:03
This is what I was looking for, thank you!  It still seems a whole lot better than what happened with MtGox.  At least it puts some faith into the system until people put their currency into their own wallet.  
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:30:34
Just looking around the house, the thought of it really bothers me.  I mean I hope to invest 5-10k into it, hoping to hold it and hoping it will grow to over 100k. But then where can I put it, I have a gun safe with my gun inside but someone can swipe the whole safe if I'm not home, it's not that big.  So the thought of holding over 100k inside my house one day..or all of my money for that matter if the best case scenario is achieved and we all switch to crypto over cash...isn't it similar to putting money under the mattress.  Even if no one can use it until they force you at gunpoint or something to give up your password, isn't that even more dangerous?  
I guess this has turned into a philosophical debate for me, but I am genuinely afraid of keeping any kind of fortune with me in my own home.  I'll have to look more into it, and I might go for it and take it off of coinbase as I buy more bitcoin, but I am very reluctant currently still.  Although learning that it's really not FDIC insured unless I keep it as USD which is pointless has me worried if it goes bankrupt or is hacked (the latter possibly causing the first) I loose it all just the same.  I think FDIC insurance is what made the banks trustworthy enough not to have to keep a small fortune under anyone's mattress.

As far as I understand, being able to short it should actually help volatility, at least thats what I got from one of Andreas Antonoupolis's interviews.  Sorry I can't remember which one, he has so many I've seen at this point, but it was one from awhile back, and here we are about to have futures contracts!  
He claimed the instability and huge risk (if I understood it correctly, please someone feel free to correct me) in the markets are mostly due to it's foundation being the dollar that's able to be manipulated at a whim by the fed.  Where-as with a foundation like bitcoin that's no longer an issue and the market forces should help to stabilize it.  An influx of money should come in from hedging.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:21:24
Thank you!  That's awesome!

Or you're gullible for even believing him.  He's very well articulated and knows his way around crypto.  He's also made a fortune from bitcoin and his fortune continues to grow.  He said that to get as much attention to the space as possible, his real figures are more conservative, unless a crash occurs within that time frame which many others are predicting is a matter of time.     
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:57:13
Why is it so different?  If I sold my bitcoin at coinbase would I be loosing out on over a 100 dollar difference from it's value on gdax or will that be priced into coinbase when I execute the sell?

@_date: 2017-11-02 01:40:11
I'm...not the guy to ask about this, no one is..but I'm implying a crash being highly unlikely at this stage.  With the futures contracts I think an influx of money will come in just from hedging, places around the world are trusting bitcoin more and more as a safer store of value than their currency and are desperately trying to buy into it, other places it's beginning to thrive, and most people in developed countries haven't even heard about it or barely know anything about it...and it's deflationary, it will go up with more people buying it, that's a given.  ::Fingers crossed:: This is going to be a very exciting year!  
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:42:52
Who knows, but there is just so much demand for it, it seems like the demand doesn't care about the fork, and we've been through forks and it's proven itself time and again, so it seems bitcoin has developed a resistance to those kinds of uncertainties.  
Edit:  Then again, from the sheer momentum it might pull back at a coincidental time, it's a gamble to try and time it.  Personally, I don't understand why at this point in it's lifetime it would pull back from a fork, if anything I would assume people would want to sell their shares from the fork once given the opportunity to do so safely.  But who knows...this is the people's currency!

They could have announced it well beforehand, preferably with more than one alt coin coming in but even bch could have been announced at least a week in advanced.

I don't mean for block size to be the answer for long term scaling.

It's just sad the pathetic state people have become where they can't rely on themselves to make investments and control themselves.  Instead we truly are in a world ridden with debt and people living paycheck to paycheck depending on others.  
I am with Tom Lee, have held through and added what I could to my position, but I'm truly disgusted with the majority and think bitcoin is better off without them.  We need businesses and institutional investors, the rest can stick to gambling and their lottery numbers.  I think lightning is the one thing on the horizon that can bring them over.

This all depends on lightning network and ETF's.  I think ETF's are being stalled until lightning is complete otherwise they would have a allowed it already.  Seems SEC knows full well of it's potential and is waiting for it to come to fruiting and then when it finds it's bearings with the 2nd layer solution I think SEC will evaluate ETF's.  If Lightning is ready by years end it will be an awesome time for bitcoin to go mainstream.  Segwit and Batching is being picked up by the biggest players so the stage is almost set.

You can never time it.  If you could, you wouldn't need bitcoin and would become rich within days right?  So when you get in, don't ever expect to get in at the bottom.  Likely it can go down the very next day just as much as it can go up, or go sideways.  You have to think of investing as a long term investment otherwise you may as well just play in a casino.  Get in and try not to look at it for at least one year because that is when it goes into long term capital gains.  Look into that for taxes, and just take it easy and let it do it's thing.  If you can wait for lightning network to complete which seems like it would be one to two years I think you would be in awesome shape, that means only invest what you are willing to loose, an amount you won't rely on for the next year or two, and it will likely be the best investment you've ever made.  Worse case, you've got other investments now or down the road with 401k or what have you.

I think there will be a game changer when it rises tremendously again and idk if alts will have an answer to it.

I'll be honest, I shared this because I was curious how people feel about a small safe increase in block size today to be ready for the next potential bull market without putting pressure or all eyes on lightning network development.  I know we've had it before but circumstances changed and I don't know if this time around batching and segwit will be enough if there is enough demand again (I don't mean demand from all of the billions of people in the world, I just mean enough that the coin is back up to 20-20k one day, that kind of demand).

We are not generating shit, we are generation a decentralized revolutionary monetary system that, if anything, promotes green energy because people can actually make more money by switching to renewables, unlike todays financial institutions which seemingly could care less.

Wow am I reading this right?  They are about to buy bitcoin and hold as we speak?  Is this the first retirement fund held in bitcoin and other crypto?

I thought one big plus for blockchain technology is immutable ledger so the markets, or transferable ownership through the block chain...although maybe that makes those tokens valuable as well..

This should be on etherium.

I could have sworn I read somewhere Starkness mentioning an ideal block size increase that was negligible but might be necessary for all the purposed lightning changes?

What are you guys talking about, I've paid fee's for every withdrawal.  Anytime I send to my wallet I paid for it.  Anytime I cashed out and sent to my bank I paid for it.

If there is demand for a retirement fund to allocate a portion to bitcoin, why wouldn't they?  Don't they want a percentage of everyone's money?  Thus if millennials are interested how can they ignore it?

It hasn't even started.  Lightning has just been announced a few days ago.  There's still going to be programs on top of it when it's actually released let alone while it's in beta.  There may even be more layered solutions.  No one knows when ETF's will be given the green light.  Maybe you need to sell and come back later if you're worried about the party being over right now.  It's truly sad the sheer number of people that can't hold a long term investment and need someone to hold their hand like an IRA or 401k.  I am personally waiting for ETF's because the majority of regular people who need their hands held seem to only want to gamble and can't even hold an investment past a few months let alone long enough to have an annual return.

Look this is understandable!  When someone puts bitcoin on credit and it has the potential to drop this much, it's too risky.  They didn't ban it from their bank as far as I understand so as much a I don't like both of them this is actually not a bad thing in my humble opinion.  It's actually a reason to give them credit, because not all banks allow trade of crypto but as far as I know bank of america does.  And I hated BOA the most for their ridiculous fee's, this is actually a huge surprise for me.

Wish I could have bought more but I'm maxed out, ain't selling though!  Just holding and relaxing letting time do it's thing.

Newb question:  If one of those nodes fails that is connected to so many from afar, the network simply finds the next closest connection and continues as if nothing happened?

I'm a little confused, news article said it was a bubble the whole time and had FUD after FUD articles.  Countries banning it multiple times, etc.  How did the news pump it?  Thought it was more of a grass roots thing.
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:00:52
Your entirely assuming what the wtf's were addressed to.  Clearly it's for the whole crazy clip people reacting with "wtf is going on" not wtf is bitcoin.

They said in 2018.  Instead they picked the most opportune time when Bitcoin was collapsing.  This was insider trading and the CEO playing dumb when it was obvious was he was going for.
I hope they read into his e-mails and see just how high up this insider trading went.

@_date: 2018-02-02 23:52:05
Good point.  Can't hurt but I think the real massive change would be when people can allocate a small portion of their retirement to bitcoin in order to further diversify.  So many millennials seem interested.

Any account that has "not giving away ___" in the name.  All of the exchanges, etc.

Unless people actually make things worthwhile rather than useless pretty things or more different sugary drinks or what have you.  Actually saving money and getting decent interest from a bank rather than living in debt paycheck to paycheck didn't seem so bad back in the day.

I don't want to jinx it but right now, especially after yesterdays meeting, holding is real easy.  It's just a matter of waiting patiently for lightning.  I don't understand how people can't hold an investment for just over a couple of months, it's mind blowing and I see why people need others to invest for them.  Pathetic honestly but they can go gamble at a casino while lightning continues development.   
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:54:59
For one thing, as far as I understand institutional investors invest a part of peoples retirement don't they?  But look what happens without them.  They manage people's investments otherwise people can't even hold on to a damn investment for a month or two.  Bitcoin is better now than it was when it was 19k, this was people gambling, you want this kind of pathetic money to come back?  Why not money that is actually stable invested for the longer term, at least longer than one to two fucking months, i mean c'mon!

This needs to go straight to the head of some CEO's, especially amazon!  It fits their model perfectly from all we've heard about how they want their shopping experience to go at brick and mortar chains.

What are you talking about.  I said "sink to such a low level" as in be so shady with con artists, misleading half truths and outright lies.

That's quite a relevant comment here.

I've had some recent back and forth there.  The righteousness, and the greatest irony is how they call this sub a cult.  What ever, not worth it to be negative, leave that over there.  I just had to mention it, it's uncanny.  A part of me also wishes more people would enlighten them but it would just be barraged with downvotes anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:03:32
What is with you people.  You are an adult and you can't hold an investment for no more than two months?  You should not be making any investments if you have no self control.  I can't believe within the course of two months this happened but I am with Tom Lee and bought in for the longer term, but seems most people including adults like yourself can't even hold an investment for an annual return.

So is literally any other altcoin.  The problem is the "crypto" coin needs value in order to be used and of all the other alt coins, bcash is the only coin taking on the purpose of creating a loss of confidence in cryptocurrency values and for what?  Where has it gotten you?  
You've shown the ability to copy and paste, change one variable and you want the world to know that another coin that has grown tremendously in value can be considered worthless on a whim due essentially to a copy cat?  Good plan!  Hope you've thought it through.  Some mind bending you'd need to convince yourself and others to assume an inefficient copy is better than the rest.

Who types in a .org when searching for anything though?  I actually went to bitcoinDOTcom when I first heard of bitcoin.  I didn't search for it.

They'll be sent to bitcoinDOTcom and fooled into buying bcash.  Seriously need a clash action lawsuit or something, I'll happily donate.
