it's a good idea, and whether or not it's a gamble depends on perspective. Holding 100% of your assets in fiat is a gamble, too. And people would just say "no that's normal". Truth is: we are probably all way to heavily invested in fiat.

Bitcoin market cap: around 14 Bio. USD
Gold market cap: around 6.3 Trio. USD
Still two orders of magnitude behind.

There's a tl;dr in the article ... but anyway:
The recent price drop offers nice insight into correlation of prices between Bitcoin and altcoins. The result: they are heavily correlated, no altcoin was above the Bitcoin panic. Dash turns out to perform less poorly than others.
There might be more examples down the list of altcoins (vertcoin also performed reasonably well). Altcoins with totally different concepts like IOTA, NXT, or Ethereum all went down with Bitcoin. Conceptual distinction doesn't help against the correlation. Investors seem indifferent.
