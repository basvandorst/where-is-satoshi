I'm sure I'll have more at some point but nothing for now. Thanks for the reply!

Fucking Preet Bharara. First poker. Then drugs. All in the name of  money laundering and terrorism financing prevention.

Thanks for the detail. But I think I should clarify a little. I meant that the majority of all bitcoins that can ever be mined are owned by less than 1% of consumers. 
We have a limited number of bitcoin, 21 million. Over half of that--as in all the bitcoin mined to date--is owned by less than 1% of consumers. Maybe even closer to 0.001%.

Not if they were completely inaccessible.

Now we're getting somewhere.

Great answer. Thanks!

But when its divided, doesn't a person still own the same percentage of bitcoin in circulation? Dividing doesn't create new bitcoin, right?

I'm not saying that its unfair at all. Just asking whether the current distribution of bitcoin will negatively affect the possibility that it becomes more mainstream.

Whoa that's awesome. Much thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:28:45
Thanks for the answer and thanks for the tip! 
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:32:17
Thank you! This was more or less what I was looking for.

This would be great to see, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I've got a feeling its seen its peak. Having said that, I'm still not selling.

Not quite the same but getting somewhere. The top one percent in the US own around 30% of the wealth. I'll try to find some stats on bitcoin ownership and get back.

I actually give new clients a 10% discount. You can retain my services for $22.5k. But I've already started billing so you've really only got about $22.4k in services left before its time it re up.

Technically anyone in possession of the drug can sell the drug if there's a buyer.
