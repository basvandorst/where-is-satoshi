Not sure where p / N is coming from, or how to make sense of that.  This guy should have said, "Finding one collision is roughly equivalent to ... winning the lottery 830,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times" rather than "on the first try".    It's ambiguous because he only gave one trial to one, but many to the other, and didn't say if there are any losing trials.  Is he saying he only wins and never loses?  Guess we don't know. I can't comment on the lightning part, that's just absurd.   
Considering that it's 8.304x10^39 times more likely to win the lottery than to hit an address collision, if you buy a lottery ticket every time you generate a new address, after a very, very, very long time, on average, you will have about 8.304x10^39 winning lottery tickets to one collision occurring, no? As I see it, the title of this post isn't wrong (mostly because the number isn't long enough).

Yeah really, it helps to understand how much more 2^160 is than 176 million.  It's not meaningless just because it's not physically possible.  Yeah, you win a fuckton of times, but hit 1 collision, in about the same time.  That's pretty impressive.  What are you missing?   You realize that no one can truly appreciate what it is to win the lottery 6 times in a row either right?  Could you explain the difference between winning 6 times in a row rather than 10 times, without using a big fuckton number?  In my opinion, the best way to break it down would be time, "If you generated a new address every second, it would take X many millennia to hit a collision.  You could win the lottery 8.3×10^39 times in the same amount of time if you played the powerball every second."  That seems to hit it home.


If your analogy requires 1.4×1048 Earths I'd say you're a fucking moron who shouldn't be in the business of comparing probabilities. :D  
The fuck you going on about? Again, I really don't care about this guy says specifically, the OP just got the title from his comment. It's not like this guy is an expert.  Focusing on the numbers here. You could use the same analogy if you like:  "If you generated a new address every second, it would take X many millennia to hit a collision.  You would probably have been struck by lightning at least X many times by then"

They weren't originally trying to calculate that, they were calculating just how much more likely it is, and others made bad assumptions. That number is 1/176000000/(1/2^160), which seems to be 8.304x10^39.  You are 8.304x10^39 times *more likely* to win the lottery given one chance than have an address collision, given one chance.

I am not talking about winning every single time in a row, and I don't think anyone else is either.  I simply believe this guy misspoke rather than made a mathematical mistake.  I'm more concerned with the title of this post anyway, which is correct.  I even argue this number is more meaningful than yours.   
p1/p2 = N answers the question: "On average, how many times can you win the lottery **(not in a row, a normal distribution)** while waiting for a single address collision to occur, assuming t1 = t2?"  **8.304x10^39**   
P1 ^ N = p2 answers the question: "What amount of times of winning the lottery in a row is equal to the probability of getting an address collision?"  **6**  
I think the first does a better job of getting the point across.

This is actually really useful.  Tells you exactly the amount of addresses in circulation to start worrying about collisions, which is around the 10^22 or 10^23 magnitude of addresses.
