are Satoshi and Nakamoto common Japanese names?

Everyone knows what nepotism is.  His father and his grandfather being store owners and mayors of a 400 person town does not exactly make him a Bush.

the biggest difference being Nakamoto actually invented something

1% of the point you made?  The majority of your comment is a rant about nepotism, which seems misguided in this particular case.
  
The problem is simply that politicians take money and champion for corporations.

before today, the name meant nothing to like 99.9% of the population.

If the story is true, I think the impact it will have on her career will be very positive. does the outrage even go past this subreddit and bitcoiners in general?  (serious question, I have no idea)

This has been a pretty redundant social commentary since Twitter became popular.  I think this story (if false) is way worse than a live news broadcast saying something incorrect though. Newsweek and their reputation will get buried.

yeah, that's also more of a problem on reddit in general, not really bitcoin exclusive.  My main point was just that people are obviously going to be incredibly skewed about something they have a financial and emotional investment in.  As for the 20% is good responses, I think I was viewing "success" as basically still alive and in use in a few years - and everyone else was thinking more along the lines of huge adoption.

isnt 6 instead of 2 the only new/novel thing in this article?  and its just briefly mentioned?  at least I hadn't heard about it
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:00:42
it is a very low figure in comparison to peoples confidence in bitcoin and their investment, IMO at least.  I don't really see a majority of people viewing it as a gamble/startup with a 20% chance.

this post is a great example of the blinders bitcoin owners wear.  an absurdly successful man who is deeply knowledgeable in the field gives bitcoin a 20% chance of success and the article is spun as something positive

Is it tough during dips in price not to panic?

China coming into the picture pretty much kills any fear of damaging U.S. government opposition IMO.  Narrative used to be a small group of nerdy, ideological Bitcoin enthusiasts trying to disrupt deeply entrenched power (government, banks, etc) and change the status quo.  That wouldn't have gone well.  But now the fear of China beating them to the punch of a potentially world changing new technology outweighs everything.
