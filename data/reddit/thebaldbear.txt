I adore bitcoin and spend my free time reading about it constantly, but it sounds like it might be hurting your social skills a little. If I meet somebody for the first time I don't want him to use it as an opportunity to blabber on about a topic *he* is interested in, eg. his religion and getting me to join it, his favourite movie and convincing me to watch it, or bitcoin and convincing me to buy it. 
I want to talk to him about an easy-going topic we are both interested in. Be very careful about being "that guy". The new people you speak to may be thinking "Tfinito isn't that interested in getting to know *me*, he's interested in hearing *himself* talk about bitcoin and/or possibly convincing me to buy it so *his* investment increases in value." 
Just some friendly advice from an older guy who also loves bitcoin.

I'm glad I didn't offend you, I've made the same mistake before with both bitcoin and other topics over the years. 
People are inherently selfish (including me and you), and will gravitate towards people whose conversations *they* enjoy. I'm talking to you because it makes me feel good to give helpful advice to somebody who is younger than me, for example.
There are countless topics which two people can both enjoy without bringing up bitcoin - save that for the closer friends who appreciate your enthusiasm and already know they like you (and know they can trust your knowledge and intentions).
Good luck in school and (most importantly) in holding throughout 2017 :D
