Would it be illegal? What are the odds of it being intercepted? I'd love to buy some, but I'm a little afraid.

I didn't know about that, but there still is a physical limit that will be reached at some point. And we're getting there.

Transistors have reached their physical limitation, they can't get smaller because of quantum tunneling. Thus, to keep up with Moore's law, something different would need to be done - maybe quantum computing. He never said that quantum computers would substitute or outmatch the classical ones, he just said that they could be the solution to keep Moore's law in effect.

That makes sense, I guess.
I hear so many different things about quantum computers that it's hard to filter what's real and what's media sensationalism.

Funny thread. You clearly don't know what you're doing.

Besides the economical an political crisis we're going through, there's a new website that sells personal information (supposedly it can find the street addresses, family members, SSN, social network accounts etc just from the name) that only accepts Bitcoin. It's all over the news here. Maybe it's helping the Bitcoin market.

Finally a post I can understand.

I'm sorry but that's just really dumb.
