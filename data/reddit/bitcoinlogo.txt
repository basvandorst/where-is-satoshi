So I read a little bit about eclipse attack, this attack has nothing to do with PoW, eclipse attack is related to the peer-to-peer network and has nothing to do with the type of consensus that this network uses. eclipse attacks can happen to any peer-to-peer network regardless of whether it uses PoS or PoW consensus.
Let me know when they find a solution for the weak subjectivity because trusting a third party wasn't part of the premise of cryptocurrencies.

Just take a look at the front page with critical Electrum vulnerability, even though Bitcoin is simple compared to other altcoins, there can still be some vulnerabilities in Bitcoin implementations (not Bitcoin itself, but its implementation by 3rd parties). Bitcoin is being developed to be the most secure and stable base, you can say protocol that other ideas can build on top of it without affecting its security, so in the future, adding new features to Bitcoin won't affect the security of the Bitcoin. This is how you build complex system.
So for example we have RootStock is being built as a sidechain to Bitcoin, finding a security flaw in RootStock won't affect Bitcoin, this means that the development on the second layer will be fast than any other altcoin. 
Now lets take the example of Ethereum that wants to have everything run as a first layer, this is just calling for problems in the future, adding a new feature like switching from PoW to PoS in Casper may always introduce new vulnerabilities in the future that didn't exist in the past versions, this means that the development of Ethereum will never finish, thus you will always not be sure how secure it is. Whereas in Bitcoin, it is being developed with the same security standards as a protocol, meaning that they actually have a goal that once they achieve it, they will stop changing its code, this will means that it will have years of proven record of being secure.

Ethereum can handle 2x Bitcoin transactions, that's not an order of magnitude, it's just 2x. Bitcoin would be able to handle more than that if we get more segwit adoption.
If you are using Ethereum, there is a high chance you are relying on a web wallet because if you try to run a full node you would understand why Bitcoin is conservative about increasing the block size.
Let me know if you actually have a full Ethereum node.

Counterparty uses the Bitcoin blockchain to store their smart contracts states, but since Bitcoin can't be aware of these smart contracts, it makes it somewhat limited. Also interacting with these smart contract mass go through the Bitcoin blockchain, because of the high fees and confirmation times, this is not ideal. 
Rootstock is a sidechain, meaning that it has its own blockchain (its own block time, block size), however, it's different from other altcoin's blockchains because it doesn't have a native token, so to use Rootstock you don't need any new token, you can use your BTC directly in Rootstock. This is achieved by the 2-way peg between BTC and SBTC (used in Rootstock), so you can convert between BTC and SBTC without relying on any third party.
So Rootstock is basically Ethereum, but instead of using ETH for its gas, it uses BTC. [+ no bailouts if you mess up your smart contract /s]
Sidechains are a revolutionary technology, this will probably eliminate most other cryptocurrencies. The only problem that need to be fixed right now for this to happen is a trust-less way for the 2-way peg, as currently Rootstock relies on a federated peg of 25 companies to ensure this peg.

A currency that has a backing could any time stop being backed by that asset and lose all what it's worth. Whereas in Bitcoin's case, it was not backed by anything from the start, so no reason for it to lose its value unless there was a problem with the Bitcoin network itself.

Actually if Bitcoin dies it means that the first blockchain experiment has failed, thus no one will put his money on the next experiment that replace it because that experiment could also fail.

Bitcoin's value comes from people's trust that it will still have value tomorrow. Where's in the case of Ethereum, if people stop developing new smart contract on their blockchain, thus less people need to buy gas with ETH, this will definitely decrease demand, thus the price of ETH, all it takes for this to happen is a competing blockchain that is better. At the moment, most of the demand for Ether is because of the ICO mania, what do you think will happen when ICO bubble burst.
RootStock is literally Ethereum as a sidechain, so any smart contract that works on Ethereum will work on RootStock. 


The whole point of the blockchain technology is that it allow you to store data in a decentralized way which decreases the chance of it being changed greatly. Otherwise if you have a blockchain that can roll back because a few people thought it was a great idea, everyone will lose trust on this blockchain.
DAO gave as Ethereum classic, depending on how they will handle the parity bug, we may end up with another fork or more people choosing to develop on Ethereum classic instead.

USD gets its value from people's faith that it will still have value tomorrow. However, the government control the USD, so they can at any moment inflate it and make it lose its value to finance whatever they want.
BTC gets its value from people's faith that it will still have value tomorrow. However, unlike USD, no one control BTC, so no one can inflate it or shut it down.
Let's say you have a Billion dollar and you want to save it somewhere, your options are very limited.
If you use a bank you risk that in case of the bank gets insolvent, you lose most of your savings as it happened to a lot of people around the world in 2008. 
Another better choice is to convert your Billion dollar into gold and store it somewhere safe. The only problem with this is that you either have to trust a third-party to sore your gold for you or you have to invest ton of money to store you gold in a way that is hard for people to steal it from you.
Bitcoin solves this problem, you create a Bitcoin wallet with 12 words seed, remember these 12 words, you go buy 1 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, send them to your Bitcoin wallet. Now you were able to store 1 Billion dollars safely, cheaply and almost anonymously. This mean you were able to store 1 Billion dollar in your head and you can move wherever in the world and spend it without help from any third-party, isn't that cooler than paying coffee with bitcoin?

RSK will benefit from Bitcoin being the most secure blockchain.
The most important thing about Bitcoin is that it has a track record of following the rules, take for example mt.gox hack where hundred of thousands of bitcoins got stolen, with that huge hack, Bitcoin didn't roll back the blockchain to give people's money back, because that will mean the end of Bitcoin and people's trust in the immutability of Bitcoin blockchain.
Now take the example of Ethereum where they used to say "code is law", but after the handling of the DAO hack and the way they are planning on handling the parity contract bug, means that they can longer claim that their blockchain is decentralized because they broke their blockchain rules and rolled back the blockchain to suit the interest of a few.
The whole idea of cryptocurrencies is to have an immutable blockchain, Ethereum can longer claim that.
RSK is as secure as the Bitcoin blockchain thanks to merge mining, however I think that RSK will not be a direct competitor to Ethereum until their end their federated peg and roll-out their trust-less 2-way peg, when do that, it will be a game changer.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:11:29
The only reason we have high fees right now is because one side of the bitcoin drama didn't want to accept reality that segwit2x didn't get adopted, so they refused to implement segwit so they can drive the fees high, they think that this way they will make the bitcoin community get frustrated with the high fees and demand a block increase, this is the game they are trying to play.
If we didn't have segwit and blocks were full, then I will agree with you that we should increase the blocksize, however, in the current situation, we already have a solution that solve the high fees, it's just not the kind of solution that coinbase/blockchain.net camp want.
If we increase the blocksize today to 2mb, this will reduce the bitcoin fees, it will also stop segwit adoption, or even lower its adoption because all new businesses won't bother with adopting segwit, this will mean that next time when we have 2mb blocks full, it will be even harder to increase segwit adoption because there is already a lot of businesses that are already using non-segwit transactions, this means the drama will repeat and we will end-up increasing the blocksize to 4mb again.
I've recently read Coinbase's CEO medium article about the scaling issue, he doesn't just want to increase the blocksize from 1mb to 2mb, his opinion is that we should double the blocksize each Y years until we reach visa tps.
This is just my opinion and I've no problem changing it if I'm wrong with my assessment.

PoS is weak economically and security wise. One example is in a PoS blockchain, if a node is offline for a relatively long period time, it can't figure out by itself what's the correct blockchain, this node will need to rely on a third-party to tell it which is the correct version of blockchain to use, in PoW this problem doesn't exist. When something is good to be true, it probably is.
Search these terms if you want to know why PoS is weaker than PoW.
Weak subjectivity of PoS.

Great read.
I think the reason why some people see Bitcoin mining as a waste of energy is that they think that there are better ways to achieve the benefits of Bitcoin without wasting that much energy.
In a perfect system, the goal is to always make things work in the ultimate efficient way, and this is possible because we're dealing in a perfect system. Our world is not a perfect system because humans are part of it, so even though we can imagine how the ultimate efficient way of doing something should be, it can't be done because, we imperfect humans are part of this system.
In a perfect world, everyone is equal in everything, so their achievement in life is equal, so for example they will end up having equal wealth. But in the real world, people are very different from each other, so we have different people with different amount of wealth. If you try to redistribute wealth so that everyone would have the same amount, you will end up with no wealth to redistribute.
Bitcoin is about people trusting the same ledger, in a perfect world, people are very honest and they have no problem in trusting each other, so having a decentralized trust-less ledger like Bitcoin or having a centralized ledger is virtually the same. However, in the real world this is different, people can't just trust each other, and for now we need to spend $4.5 Billions annually so that we can trust that the history of the ledger transactions are correct. Is this perfect? no, but this goes for many other systems where humans are involved.
TLDR; In a perfect world, trust is free. In the real world, for humans to agree that the history of a decentralized ledger (Bitcoin) has the correct history, we need to spend $4.5 Billion/year.

I think there should be a balance between the level of security and simplicity. for me I find that running electrum on an offline computer for signing transactions and an other electrum client as hot wallet is secure enough and easy to use, in this case you wouldn't even need to connect a usb to your offline computer, just maybe a QR code and a camera would be enough for signing a transaction.

So you're stating rumors to make definitive  conclusions! Also you are saying in this comment that the central bank campaigned against Jackson.


You conclude that Jackson hated the central bank because they campaigned against him, so you conclude that Jackson motive was political.
You should ask yourself why would the central bank campaign against Jackson if he didn't opposition to the central bank prior to them campaigning against him? well, just show you that your comment doesn't make any sense and that Jackson didn't like the central bank even before he had any conflict with them in a political way. So him not liking the central bank is ideological rather than political. Your circular reasoning doesn't work.

The yellow color (light) that moves from one string (node) to another is symbolic for lightning funds that moves from one node to another to reach its destination at a high speed (speed of light). Well, at least that was my intention.

You can have a coin that is completely centralized, however, there is no such thing as complete decentralization. So I guess I should have worded my phrase better by saying that BTC is the most decentralized not the only decentralized.
There are a lot of factors in measuring the decentralization of a coin, one of these is the hash rate but it's not the only important factor. 
Unlike other coins, Bitcoin block's propagation don't favor big miners, which means unlike others coins, Bitcoin doesn't encourage centralization, so big or small miners can profit in the same proportion.
Bitcoin doesn't rely on a single person/company etc.
Unlike some other coins, Bitcoin has a long track record of not changing the history of the blockchain just because some exchange/wallet getting hacked.
And for Hash rate decentralization, I think a lot of Bitmain competitors are developing their own chips, like that Japanese firm or Samsung producing new ASICs to mine bitcoin.

It may just go back to 80% once people realize that BTC is the only decentralized coin out there.

Buying or using your old computer for storing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is in my opinion far safer than using a hardware wallet. Of course this computer should remain offline and you only use it for Cryptocurrency storage, this way you can actually install on it a software that you trust like Bitcoin-core/electrum or even generate a paper wallet on that computer.
The thing that I don't like about hardware wallets is that they are designed specifically for Bitcoin and all of the hardware produced is pretty much the same, so with my limited-technical knowledge in this field, I can deduce that this is not good for generating a random number necessary for creating the private keys of your wallet. Using Your own old computer, that is a general computing device can increase the entropy of the system, thus better random numbers are generated this way.
This is just my opinion based on my limited knowledge, so take it with a grain of salt.

Although as mentioned by someone earlier, it would be easier for a thief to just run away with the goods than double spend the transaction, it is not that hard to double spend a transaction when a store requires 0-conf because it doesn't require 51% attack to double spend.
The buyer could pay for the goods, the merchant sees that the transaction has been broadcasted but not confirmed yet, so he accept this transaction, the buyer can then create another transaction using the same output as the previous transaction but this time increase the transaction fee to be higher than the transaction fee of the previous transaction, this will result in the payment made to the merchant not to be confirmed and instead the buyer's second transaction will be the one to be included on the next block because it has a higher transaction fee.
This is possible because of Bitcoin Replace-By-Fee shortly known as RBF. The user that create the transaction can choose to whether make their transaction RBF or not. So if I was a merchant I want to accept 0-conf transactions, I would at least require the customers to only send transaction with RBF disabled, this way even if the buyer made another transaction using the same previous output, they can't be sure which transaction will be included in the next block and also this will make it so that the first transaction to have a higher chance to accepted instead of the second transaction because the first transaction would have been already delivered to all miners so they will reject the second transaction.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:37:09
I'm pretty sure what I said is correct, and that's the reason why RBF was considered controversial.
If you send an amount of bitcoins you will be using a certain output for this transaction, part of the output will be used for the miner's fee and the other remaining will be sent to the addresses you have specified. So if you change the transaction fees you will also have to change the amount sent to the other addresses.
If you are sure about your claim, please reference your source.
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:46:38
He meant that when there are a lot of transactions happening on the Bitcoin network, people who want their transaction to be confirmed in a reasonable time need to pay a higher fee, as miners choose to include transactions with higher fees to maximize their return. So because of this scarcity, people will pay higher fees competing with other who also want their transaction to be confirmed ASAP, this competition will raise the transaction fees of a Bitcoin transaction sometimes to more than $15 as was the case in the last Bitcoin bull market.
This is way in the long term, it is best for merchants to use the Lightning networks for these kind of transaction. As the lightning network is way faster and have virtually no fees.

People can create multiple addresses to vote multiple times, so this won't work.
The voting power of an address should have the same weight as how much Bitcoin it has, this is the best option because people with huge amount of Bitcoin would want Bitcoin to succeed, which would mean they will invest some of their time to make educated decision better than people who have very small amount of Bitcoin to lose if their voting decision was bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:21:05


make up your mind. 
All of the blockchains that advertise that their blockchain or consensus algorithm is better than Bitcoin are just sacrificing either decentralization or security to achieve that. Give me an example of a blockchain that is better than Bitcoin in either decentralization, security, scalability without sacrificing one to achieve the other.
Bitcoin already works, it is the best at what it  does, which is a digital store of value which is more important than a cryptocurrency that prevents coffee purchase censorship but fails to protect your wealth.

People with full nodes control which blockchain the Bitcoin network will use but they certainly don't control what protocol they use to determine that. If they unilaterally decided to choose a different protocol, they'll end up using an Altcoin.
Since currently Bitcoin mining is relatively decentralized, so no one miner can impose on the rest of the network what Bitcoin is and what is not, the only point of centralization right now is the Bitcoin source code.
You said that nodes are free not to update the client, but if they do so and they result in not following basic Bitcoin protocol, they'll end up running an Altcoin. My suggestion will make sure we avoid these continuous forks, because voting on Bitcoin Improvements Proposals will be democratic and all people that hold Bitcoin will have a say on this. This will deter disagreeing parties from forking and will promote independent developers to suggest BIPs and let the Bitcoin community decide its future.
I'm not sure if you understood my previous suggestion, so I will try to make it clear this time.
My suggestion is to create a new independent network of computers that keep track of the current version of Bitcoin. This network will work similarly to Bitcoin, but it's goal is to let the Bitcoin users determine in a democratic way, which changes should the Bitcoin protocol use. Let's call this new network "A".
The protocol of "A" should be minimal and should be designed in a way to never be changed, this way, "A" will be the one that can be used to determine what Bitcoin really is. When there is a disagreement between what new BIPs Bitcoin should adopt, we use this new network to vote, if the vote is in favor of this new BIP, it should be added to the "A" blockchain, so that the last block of "A" contain the code of this new BIP.
Imagine if we had such a system implemented already when there was much discussion about increasing the block size or whether to implement segwit or not, if we had such a system, any developer or group of developers can make their case to all Bitcoin users and these users with their Bitcoin holdings decide which proposals they should approve and which they shouldn't. This way no one can pretend to represent the real Bitcoin, and it will make it easier for new things to be done and create a fair level for competing ideas to flourish.

Bitcoin is not yet mature enough to be a stable store of value, that's true, but that's just because it has only been in existence for about 9 years. When Bitcoin reaches it full potential value, its volatility will calm down and we will see that Bitcoin will be used as a hedge against inflation, that rises or fall depending on the fiat's inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:53:22
People like to assume that everything about Bitcoin is decentralized, which is false. Everything is "centralized" when delve deep enough, so the question about decentralization is not a yes or no question, but rather, how much decentralized something is.
Bitcoin is relatively decentralized when you compare it to other cryptocurrencies when it comes to who issues new blocks. However when you go one step deeper into the Bitcoin system, you will find out that the way the Bitcoin protocol gets updated is centralized, people can write different software, but they have to follow the standard protocol for their software to interact with the Bitcoin network.
So in reality, the people who updates/write the bitcoin protocol, control what Bitcoin is.
I find it really strange that at the time that everything is getting decentralized, Bitcoin development is not.
So what we need to do is create a decentralized system where people can vote on which Bitcoin protocol the network should use, the voting power is equivalent to how much Bitcoin that person owns. Until we do that, there will always be disagreements and new forks in the future.

Totally agree, if the customer paid a merchant using bitcoin, then that merchant is accepting bitcoin, whether that merchant sells their BTC for USD immediately or not, this doesn't affect that the transaction was completed using bitcoin.
A more reasonable complain is to say that merchants are not pricing their product in bitcoin, but that's impractical due to bitcoin volatility, let's hope that the volatility stabilize in the future, which will allow merchants to price their goods in bitcoin.

This is why every Bitcoin bull trend will always be bigger than the the previous ones, people can actually afford to buy a whole bitcoin, those people like the OP are the future hodlers of bitcoin, people who own exactly 1 bitcoin will probably store it and just forget about it until its value reaches what each consider to be a good price.

Keeping your bitcoins at an online exchange/wallet is convenient, but as others have said, keeping your coins at an exchange has some risk to it because exchanges are always a target to hackers, so if it ever got hacked, you'll lose your coins, that's why they are advising you against keeping your coins at an exchange. 
Depending on how much you hold and how often do you transfer your bitcoins and how much do you want to trade security with easy of use or the other way around, you should determine whether you should hold your coins at an online exchange, using light wallet or full node wallet.
Now to answer your question on whether its safe to keep your coins at Coinbase. Because of the coming hard fork, there could be a situation where Coinbase decide which blockchain represent THE Bitcoin and which represent the other altcoin, and since you don't control your private keys at Coinbase, you can't disagree with them, that's why it's always advised to not keep your coins at an exchange/wallet that doesn't give you control over your bitcoin's private keys, especially during a hard fork.

I heard about that product, it's a great idea but it still require some level of trust in the manufacturer. I see that in order for someone to access the private keys, they need to permanently remove some resistance that will alter the state of the stick and reveal the private key.
For some small amount of bitcoin, this may be okay, however, for large amounts I don't know if you can comfortably transact this way, because at any moment, someone can discover a way to hack it and get the private keys without breaking that resistance. I'm sure it's secure right now, but you never know what will happen in the future.
