There are (60x60)x24 seconds in a day, so 86,400.
With 50000 users a day, you're looking at less than one per second.
...still a very high volume what most places couldn't manage, but it's not insanity levels of scaling.

Market cap is a very bad metric here.
You could not take all coins in existence and sell them for the current market price. The market cannot bear that volume. There isn't that much money flowing in.

This is completely reasonable. Also explains why there was the "investor" stuff... They were trying to get funding to survive until they legally get back access to their funds/coins.
As much as we make fun of MtGox for being terrible, I always have to think back to movie quotes where the organized crime gangs say that it's more profitable and easier to just legally run the bank than steal all the money. 
Makes sense, really. Why risk going to jail over stealing the funds yourself when you can just charge a fee for every transaction?

Plus he could possibly control the largest sum of coins of anyone. He holds a huge amount of power with the effect he can have on the market. Moving even one of those coins would upset the market hugely.
...But considering it's worth $400mm, it's interesting that he never moved any earlier. He must either not want to move them, no need to move them, or simply destroyed the keys. Each one of those possibilities leads to a "why?"
That's the mystery.

Yes, you are right, but they need to be reasonably dissimilar. I think GNOME Project feels that Groupon is basically creating a Point of Sale OS called Gnome.
IMO, it's reasonable to say that a POS's OS is similar to a normal OS.

This pops up every-time Bitcoin prices go up, and suicide hotline posts pop up when it goes down.
Truthfully, it's cringe-worthy. There are a lot more wealthy people on Reddit than just on You're not particularly special no matter how many bitcoins you have, and it's gonna be extremely rare that someone is targeted in such a manner.

Seeing bitcoin traded on a serious exchange would be interesting.
I'm not saying folks like Coinbase aren't serious exchanges, but the current software of the exchanges can't trade like NYSE or the other exchange platforms can.
Have the NYSE software guys implement a bitcoin trading exchange would be huge for reliability and pricing.

Because it’s likely not enough to run a country in any meaningful sense.
You’re off by a few factors of magnitude. It would be easier for them to buy bitcoins if anything.

Reality always wins in the long-term, but long-term can be feel like forever or happen in an instant.
I’m as big of a bitcoin fan as anyone, but you’re lying to yourself if you believe the current price isn’t based in pure speculation and possibly more so the fear of missing out on low prices before it goes higher. 
There could be a downturn at any time. It could hit 1k before it hits 10k. It could hit $10k in a week, or $50K in a year. There could be an upswing at any time.
There are no fundamentals, no guarantees, no price controls, and no regulations. It’s just mathematically limited virtual currency.
I hope bitcoin succeeds to the fullest, but I do worry for those who go all-in or over extend themselves. Bitcoin rose to popularity in a phenomenal global financial market. There aren’t many losers right now, and everyone feels like they are capable of picking only winners.
 
Bitcoin can be successful far beyond any arbitrary guess as to its’ current market value. I hope people don’t treat it as a religion or a perfect solution, they’re the ones who can get bit the hardest.

It's speculation in the sense you're assuming Bitcoin is the exact cryptocurrency to win the race to being the world currency.
It's all hypotheticals. More likely than not right now, but nothing can be predicted that far into the future.

Outside of safety concerns, I don't think I would change a thing.
I work in the datacenter industry, and we've discussed how we'd build a bitcoin mining datacenter. It would be bottom dollar like this.
No high availability except for the network core, and not a penny spent on UPS/generator. The downtime of power outages is likely significantly less than the earnings of saving the capital and instead buying more mining capacity.
This is why the American Bitcoin mining operations that try to operate in real datacenters are doomed to fail. There is no way you can compete with bottom dollar operations like this.
That said, if you would like a real America based Bitcoin Datacenter, hit me up... Gonna need at least $1-2million to get started on the building... The Chinese are paying 1/100th that.

Risk bricking an iPhone over jailbreaking? Shut. The. Fuck. Up.
You would think for a crypto-currency the average user would have a better understanding of mobile technology. You can't permanently damage an iPhone by jailbreaking. It doesn't even harm the warranty.

I would bet the development engineering on the miners is basically done now that they are in production.
You're not going to put electrical/ASIC engineers in a warehouse packing boxes, they're gonna work on something else.

It's going to be a rough day if anyone finds a major flaw. We better hope whatever vulnerabilities there are... aren't fatal blows.

They have like 15-30 days to unregister the domain, and they will owe ICANN nothing. This is of no major risk to them.
This domain return period is how domain buying companies work. They buy the domain, check the traffic levels (like if it's a typo of another site) and decide whether to keep or return it.
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:16:06
Yeah, this is a huge worry. A coin is something a person might take or move without thinking about it at all.
I would buy 10-15 cards, encrypt the cards, and then just hide them in a ton of different places. It's not like someone who finds it thinks they're getting anything more than a flash disk. And really, provided its an encrypted file/message, it's probably safest to store it on a few email/cloud file storage places.
Then you don't have to worry about anything physical at all. Assuming bitcoin prices remain stable or go up, it's almost perfect for storing money like this.
@_date: 2013-06-15 14:40:23
If you look at the original question, it seemed like the money was obtained illegally and you had to protect it while you were in jail.
I would assume almost everything that gains interest would be easily found by the FBI/cops, so unless you invested in a small business under-the-table, you can't expect to gain much in the year you're in jail.
Interesting thought-problem, really.

Yes, they stripped off the shielding/jacket of the outer layer. I'm not sure why they did it, because they still kept the twisted-pairs intact.
I guess it helps thin out the bundle, but I really don't think having a real combed Ethernet cable bundle would have been much thicker.

That means it's just unsupported, it's not that the warranty is void. I've taken  jailbroken devices into Apple stores before, and as long as the issue is unrelated to software, they will help you still.

This is highly unlikely.

I think it's a simple typo/bad sentence. They're trying to say - if they can't transfer the money, having the wallet file doesn't prevent the coins being spent by someone else who has another copy.
It should have read: "If the FBI is not able to transfer the money,  having possession of the wallet file itself is not enough to prevent the coins being spent."

If these are anything like Intel chips when it comes to creating, it's cheap to produce in mass quantity, but the R&amp;D costs millions (or billions in Intel's CPUs).
This why they are able to afford sending two units to make up for the folks who would get an underperformer.
