Not all alt coins are trash, some have interesting technology behind them. More importantly though, unless BTC fixes the network issues then it will slowly but surely lose its dominance. Also remember that past performance is not indicative of future performance. The crypto market in general is in a massive bubble right now, I've researched a lot of coins and there are a shocking number with ZERO technology backing valued in the billions. Many coins haven't had a Git update in years and valued in the hundreds of millions. The market is eerily similar to the dot com bubble, it's hugely overvalued and WILL crash but there will also be a few significant winners that survive it.

Median lifetime earnings for a bachelor's and higher is 1.8 million in the US, what makes you think over 2 million wouldn't last? It ends up giving you an "income" of 100k for 20 years or 50k for 40 years. More importantly that's ignoring interest, he could be making ~150k per year at 7.5% with a tax rate of 15%. You may not be able to live a life of luxury forever but you could certainly live comfortably. I don't know if OP actually made this much but that would be enough if you're responsible with your money.

Well it would depend on the will, just like any other asset. The difference is that if the private keys were lost then there would be no way to claim the bitcoins.

The S3 is really old, it puts out 478 GH/s at 366 watts. Assuming your electricity costs are 10 cents per kilowatt hour, you would actually lose money running it. With free electricity you're still only making $25 per month. I wouldn't even take that miner for free, much less pay for it.

Extremely oversimplified.  
ELI5: Bitcoin is nothing more than a ledger holding every transaction ever made; a chain made up of blocks filled with transactions. This is where the term blockchain comes from. A new block is added by a miner figuring out the appropriate hash which all other servers running the Bitcoin protocol agree upon. The hashing algorithm used is Sha256 and is only one way, the same input will produce the same output every single time, but there's no way to figure out the input from the output. Miners add a random number, called a nonce, and change it over and over again while checking the hash until it has a certain number of leading zeroes, depending on the difficulty level. The difficulty is constantly adjusted based on the network hash rate to, on average, produce 1 block every 10 minutes. Due to the nature of it being one way, it takes a lot of CPU power to guess the right hash but is very simple to verify. Hash rate is, as the name implies, the rate at which you can guess hashes (usually measured per second.) The higher your individual hash rate relative to the network hash rate, the quicker you can check a new nonce, therefore the better your chances of finding an appropriate hash. The miner that finds this special value gets rewarded with 12.5 BTC (and all transaction fees in the block). I can go into more detail if you're curious about any specific details.  
ELI2: Miners run a hashing algorithm on blocks of transactions with a random number added over and over again until the output of the hash meets certain requirements that everyone has agreed upon. If they find that special value, the miner is rewarded 12.5 BTC, so all miners are competing to find that special value first. Hash rate is the speed at which you can run that algorithm.

Depends on where you live, it's likely that Bitcoin is considered an asset and would behave just like any other in a will. The network is decentralized and can't have an owner, wallets are owned by whoever holds the private key.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:12:04
The network hash rate is far too high for a regular computer to make anything mining Sha256 (e.g Bitcoin), the best you can hope for is to barely cover electrical costs. You won't get more than 20 million hashes per second with a CPU and even with several GPUs you're only looking at a few billion hashes per second. Specialized hardware reaches over 12 trillion hashes per second. There is simply no way to make money without an ASIC device anymore, but you can still mine altcoins. Check the Nicehash profitability calculator for a rough estimate on what your CPU/GPU will net.

More like the "mainstream" has absolutely no idea what they're talking about and you may as well consult your magic 8 ball. There are real signs of a bubble, like coins with little to no technology behind them being valued in the hundreds of millions, but price predictions like this mean nothing.

That's probably because they're running a full node locally so they can validate the funds exist without waiting for the network. Allowing the minimum possible fee is stupid though because, even if the funds exist, it's likely that transaction will never actually be included in the block chain.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:27:40
If you had the choice of two banks -- one processing transactions in 30 seconds with a fee of $.01 or another that took 10+ hours with a fee of $25 -- which would you choose? It's a rhetorical question. The BTC network may have lower fees and quicker transaction times as the network becomes less congested, but that's the point, it can't handle mainstream adoption without change. As it grows the network will become more congested, leading to slower confirmations and higher fees.  
The lightning network is of course one proposed solution, as block size increases are another, but the point is BTC won't survive if it can't process transactions in a timely and cheap manner. If it takes BTC 1-2 years to do that, it may have dropped too low for recovery with other coins having better technology taking the lead. I'm not saying this is a certainty, it's not, but the medium term response of BTC will be very important to whether it's a long term winner in my view. Even BTC Git contributors have arguments over this on the repository, it's a real issue, I'm not sure why so many seem to be burying their heads in the sand assuming BTC will remain king just because it always has been.

On it will be hard to find any reliable information about the guy because they're all so biased in favor of him. You have the exact same problem in the other direction here, is heavily biased against him. The fact is that Roger has nothing more to do with BCH than Jim Cramer has to do with Apple, he's just a bullish proponent. However, he does own Bitcoin.com and there is literally no reason to use that wallet, you're better off with a hardware wallet anyway. While I know this doesn't answer your question, all I want to clarify for you is that it really doesn't matter whether he's shady or not so long as you avoid his website, as that's all he truly has control over.

They can't because there is inherently no way to know who owns a private key and they won't because it's not government issued currency. It's treated by the government as property, similar to stocks, you are "investing" at your own risk.  Exchanges can be and indeed in some cases are regulated to an extent, requiring the exchange to meet banking compliance standards and have the legal obligation to protect its customers assets. The entire purpose of the FDIC was to restore trust in the banking system during a time of fear (The Great Depression) to protect their own currency, they wouldn't do the same for cryptos. Further regulation requiring improved security practices may come for exchanges but they won't ever receive insurance like the banks do for the USD.

Fees are set by the sender and have nothing at all to do with the transaction amount. They are an incentive to miners to include the transaction in their next block.

I don't own an S9 so I don't know how much control it gives you. However If you only own a single S9 then it would be largely pointless as you would need to provide the proof of work for the block entirely yourself, so your chances are astronomically low. You will be more profitable in a pool. Whether there are pools that exist which don't confirm any transactions, I don't know. I doubt it though, the transactions are hashed based on the Merkel root so it takes the same amount of time to hash 1 transaction as it would for thousands.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:00:46
What are you referring to when you say untested code? Bigger blocks? The core code base of BCH is the same as BTC, it's a fork, the major difference is just block size. This doesn't need to be tested so thoroughly, all it does is increase the upper limit of requirements for running a node and is still well within the capabilities of normal users. There are BTC contributors on favor of block size increases and Satoshi expected them as well. A better argument would be that you have more faith in the continuing development of BTC than BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:29:43
Number of transactions in that block is only 1, the special transaction that rewards the miner. This particular miner isn't actually approving any transactions, he's just searching for a valid nonce to satisfy the proof of work to reward himself. While that may go against the philosophy of Bitcoin, it's not against the rules of the protocol.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:33:28
First of all, it's not a Ponzi, it can't be due to the nature of how cryptos work. A Ponzi is paying old investors with new investors money. BTC doesn't pay anyone, exchanges and other third parties do, and the value rises and falls based on market sentiment. Second of all, if it was a Ponzi then it would absolutely make sense to dump as fast as you could. To answer your question about why people are selling, there are a plethora of reasons, but (for non day traders) it mostly boils down to they believe the price is overvalued.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:46:00
He does have a lot of influence over the market, as does Jim Cramer, hence the analogy. There is no evidence to suggest he is engaged in any sort of fraud, but he's incredibly biased so I would take anything he says with a grain of salt. Keep in mind that he's heavily invested in BCH and divested from BTC so he financially benefits from the two cryptocurrencies flipping in value. He is a convicted felon as I'm sure many in this subreddit will point out, but it's not for anything related to financial crimes, you can read about it on his Wikipedia. His sites wallet is a fork of Bitpays wallet and completely open source, but I would still make the switch to a hardware wallet such as Ledger Nano S when you get the chance for maximum security.

From a home computer? You won't get anything, the hash power of the Bitcoin network is far too strong. Its dominated by ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) devices that can generate over 10 trillion hashes per second. Your CPU is unlikely to even reach 20 million and your GPU might only get a couple hundred million. Even with a monster setup with many GPUs you're only looking at a few billion hashes per second. Long story short unless you invest in an ASIC then you'll barely cover electricity costs.

This isn't government backing, it's a public company offering insurance.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:25:13
The argument for bigger blocks leading to centralization really makes no sense in the context of Bitcoin. Specialized hardware is already required and there is a large barrier to entry to build sufficient hashing power with this hardware. Using home computers to mine is completely pointless. Using my i7 6700k with OpenMP and heavily optimized AVX for hashing generates less than 20 million hashes a second. Using an array of high end GPUs with Cuda or a specially programmed FPGA might generate up to couple billion per second. Meanwhile, specialized ASIC hardware can reach over 65 billion hashes per second per chip with hundreds of chips per machine. These can not only net significantly more hashes than home hardware at 12.5+ trillion hashes a second but consume far less power per hash. The best method for decentralization is an improved proof of work algorithm that is protected fom ASIC advantages, such as Ethereums Ethash.

Without specialized hardware, yes. The best Sha256 (Bitcoin algorithm) miner right now is the S9 which will net about $850 / month at the current difficulty but costs $2.7k. Most specialized mining hardware takes a few months to turn a profit and has a high initial investment.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:18:02
That just depends on both how secure and how redundant you want it to be. What happens if you experience data loss? What if you lose your rar password? What if you lose your hard drive? You could get a Ledger Cryptosteel to avoid worries over hard drive failure but then you need to secure the physical keys. The Winklevii spread their keys out in safety deposit boxes around the world for redundancy and security, but that's probably not necessary for you. Just improve security and redundancy as you see fit, if you're comfortable with your current setup then keep it (for now). I would also have at least 1 paper copy, or Cryptosteel, in a secure location though in the case of hard drive failure.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:05:10
No problem, it can be a bit confusing when you first get started. To answer your question, no, you need to get 100 million Satoshi to get a Bitcoin. Like I said earlier, you will barely cover electricity costs mining without specialized hardware.

Miners don't set the fees, the sender does and they're used in addition to the block reward to incentivize miners. There is a limitation to the number of transactions per second based on the block size, so when the network gets overly congested (e.g higher adoption rates) you inevitably end up having to pay higher fees if you want your transaction to be included. The reason being that there are so many transactions waiting to be approved and miners will always prioritize those that have the highest fees.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:36:10
You can visit  to view current transaction fees, it's nowhere near $250.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:43:00
Compared to fiat or whatever they're selling for. They would rather have 14k in USD than a little over 1 BTC. They feel the market cap of 235 billion is overvalued and will fall. Could be because of slow confirmations, high fees, they no longer believe in the technology, they never understood the technology and are now simply scared it won't continue rising since it's started to stagnate, etc. I cant comment for any one individual, but that's the reason people sell one asset for another, they believe the other asset has more value.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:55:36
Fees are directly related to adoption, the more people using BTC the higher the fees will be. Only so many transactions can fit in a block  (1MB hard limit) and miners choose which transactions go into the next block. When the number of unconfirmed transactions gets clogged enough then fees will inevitably rise higher and higher as senders compete to be included. This will not improve and indeed will continue to get worst until a solution to the scaling problem is implemented 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:43:13
Satoshi Nakamoto was never against raising the block size, in fact he expected it. He just never gave any guidelines on when or how to increase it. Further, he predicted that in the future there would be a lot of infighting as to the best way to scale which would lead to hard forks.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:45:54
You will get far more information about the scalability debate here than you will from a reddit comment.

The first pool came out in December 2010, did you mine from Slush? The reward in 2010 was 50 BTC -- I'm not sure what the network hash rate was, how long you were mining, or any other variables, 2BTC just seems really low from mining that long ago.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:47:01
I'm aware that some do. OP was referring to government backed ease of mind analogous to FDIC, of which is extremely unlikely to ever happen for Crypto. I'm not an insurance expert but I believe you're wrong about private companies being able to offer insurance for anything they want though, there are a ton of regulations in that department. Athough I'm sure exchanges would fall under financial institutions in regards to the insurance statutory reserve requirements.
There is a big difference between an exchange offering insurance and FDIC. Assuming an exchange ignores or otherwise gets around statutory reserve requirements or becomes insolvent for any other reason, you may never see your funds again. If a bank collapses for the same reason, the government will cover those losses. If the government becomes unable to cover those losses then you have much bigger problems anyway. It's the difference between trusting a company and trusting the government.

Well I don't really like that analogy, but I understand the point you're making. The decentralized ledger does have value (many traditional financial institutions are working on leveraging this technology) but BTC obviously does not have ownership of it. There are several alt coins that take what BTC started (cryptographically secure decentralized currency) while solving different problems. ZCash improves privacy with zero knowledge proofs. Ethereum improves miner decentralization with a theoretically ASIC resistant proof of work algorithm. Bitcoin Cash improves transaction limitations  (e.g fees) with larger block sizes.  
These are just examples, some solve more than one problem and they are not the only coins that solve the problems previously mentioned. The best solutions are also up for debate, many believe higher block sizes are not the best long term solution to lower fees for example. I don't think the technology leads to short term price fluctuations unless it has real world consequences that users disapprove of, such as fees in the case of BTC. Rather the best technology is the most likely to win over the long term. All I would suggest is do your own thorough research on various coins before investing.

Minor correction, FDIC covers up to 250k.

The block size on Bitcoin is 1MB and the difficulty adjustment it set to confirm 1 block every 10 minutes. You can only fit so many transactions into a block, so when too many transactions are in the pool waiting for approval then the network gets congested. There are 2 ways that miners get compensated for their CPU power, 1 is the special transaction that gives the "block reward" to the miner that provides the proof of work  (currently 12.5 BTC) and the other is fees. When the network gets congested, miners can't approve all transactions quickly enough so they pick and choose which transactions go into their next block, and they will always choose those with the highest fees.
