Here's a blog post that I wrote listing our goals for 2015: Casheer: Disrupting Commerce 10 Changes to Watch for in 2015

I agree! William Burton, Casheer's CEO, did a fantastic job. He wasn't even planning on speaking. I was scheduled to give the presentation. I was sent a packet of info telling me to prepare as if it were a Ted Talk. Less than an hour before my time slot, I received an email saying my speaking time had been significantly cut. I started asking around and found out this wasn't going to be anything like a Ted Talk. There was going to be some sort of judges panel? I panicked. I was already nervous about speaking. William is ALWAYS cool and collected so he went up there (without any prep beforehand) and nailed it. People were following him back to our booth.

Here's a video that played at the end of the presentation. There is an even BETTER one that played in the background while William spoke. I'll post that one soon too.

We really appreciate the support from the maxcoin community and you in particular, Highlifes. I promise you that it does not go unnoticed.

Can we please, please, please read the article before commenting? You might notice the absence of the word "Bitcoin". 
Thanks.

The main suggestion in the article is to digitize paper vouchers. Deploy the funds to a mobile app. That same app can be used by merchants to accept digital payments (merchants are already accepting paper vouchers and it's a PIA).
Aid isn't currently being distributed fairly and there is no way of tracking where it went.

Just before the mention of rape occurring, the words "endured untold hardships" are highlighted. You can click on them and it brings up an article that lists the hardships -including rape. 
It's not fun to read about this, but it's happening everyday and most of us are shielded from it. The purpose of the article was to show that the refugees are fighting hard just to LIVE and they aren't risking death to try and get a few handouts.
 
The way aid is currently implemented does nothing to foster self-sufficiency. It's a band-aid at best. Some might even argue that it's intentionally designed to create dependency...
There is currently no way to track international aid. 
Corruption within humanitarian agencies is so "hush-hush" there are virtually no studies on it.
Regarding the refugees specifically, they need more than aid. They need access to financial transactions. If they have family members living elsewhere that want to send money to help out, there is no way to do so -even though most of the refugees have cellphones.

There's this thing called a blockchain...

Read the article and you'll notice that:
1. Bitcoin is not mentioned.
2. Digitizing paper vouchers is the main suggestion. 
Thanks.
