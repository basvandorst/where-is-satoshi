Good work with the python script. Would you care to try this tool out?  [   
It was created for exactly this purpose and it can be run in offline mode on a secure computer. Would love some feedback.

It IS possible to create your own seed phrase, but it still should be random. As others have commented, never use a seed phrase that is not fully random! 
If you rely on the Trezor's internal random number generator, there is a (small) risk that the device was manipulated and will generate a seed which can be controlled by an attacker.
I have created a small guide and a calculator to help people who want to create their own seed securely. You can find it at [seedpicker.net](

Did you reply to the wrong comment? :)

I created the tool [Seedpicker]( for the purpose of calculating the last word of a 24-word passphrase. It's meant to be used with any 23 words from [the official list of 2048 words]( Those words should still be randomly selected by using dice, raffle tickets or similar. It is however possible - but HIGHLY discouraged - to pick the first 23 words in a "clever" way.  
Read the guide and all warnings before using it "for real".

Thanks for your comment. This is addressed in the FAQ. On mobile now,  will comment more later if needed.
Edit: [This Q in the FAQ]( It is about using dice only, but the principle is the same with cards. If you start with some kind of "raw" entropy, you need to trust or understand the code that converts it to seed words.

Agreed. The transparency issue becomes even more important when you are helping somebody else creating a seed. Imagine letting your grandmother shuffle the deck to get entropy for her bitcoin wallet.  Then you say "Good job! Now I will convert these cards into 24 words". She then has no way of convincing herself that you have not cheated and instead used one of your own seeds.

Interesting thread. 
I totally agree that you should always use a hardware wallet. What annoys me with HW wallets is the lack of transparency of the seed generation algo. Which is the reason I wanted something like SeedPicker in the first place. And I like having passphrases of "convenient" lengths. 
If I were to store a large number of coins, however, I would probably use SeedPicker or similar to create both the seed and the passphrase! :)

Thanks for this feedback! There is actually a TODO comment about this in the javascript code. Currently, the first match is selected but the plan is to pick them randomly. And not a lot of entropy is lost, so it seemed like something that could be postponed for a while.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:57:34
Thanks! I am learning a lot from this too.

The T342 issue is fixed now, thanks again for spotting it! 
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:46:51
I think they will fix it, but new vulnerabilities can be found at any time. Always make sure you have good physical security too. Put your HW wallet in a hidden or locked place (or both). Even if you have generated a really secure seed.  And use a passphrase and a good PIN.

Thanks for your comment. And the tip, nice gesture. 
You can remove the "almost" :) The checksum word is not supposed to be random at all so these seeds are as random as they get. 
Let me know if you try it out some time, any feedback is welcome.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:15:09


This is the main use case of the web page! You can run it online too if you just want to try it out with a dummy seed.  
If you didn't find it by now, it's here: [
NEVER USE IN ONLINE MODE WITH A REAL SEED!

Thanks for commenting!
Your question is a good one, and it is adressed in the FAQ:,[
TLDR: If you create your own seed you don't have to worry about the seed generation function in your hardware wallet being compromised.
@_date: 2019-01-10 14:03:24
Good point. I was thinking about  adding a Q in the FAQ about this. Now I definitely will :)
The more you trust your seed, the shorter you can make your passphrase. Longer gives better security but less convenience. The constant balance act between security and convenience... Also, the passphrase usually has to be typed into the computer, on a keyboard that may have a keylogger.
I mostly agree though, I see SeedPicker mainly as an educational project.
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:51:33
Thanks for commenting! The code is open, see the Github link in the post :)
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:02:24
Thanks for great feedback. 
I think you are right about T342! I missed that. The ticket definitely goes back. Not a showstopper but, again, great feedback! Thanks.
Regarding the comparison to the "dies only" approach: The difference is transparency for non-techies, and it is adressed in [the FAQ]( But good point!
