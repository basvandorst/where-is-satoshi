What is your source for this? The Tax Authorities have not commented on Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.

I am afraid you are wrong. As an Icelandic lawyer, I have researched the matter. The most likely scenario is VAT, like in Norway.
@_date: 2015-06-08 11:53:36
Bitcoin will likely have VAT levied upon it, even if it becomes possible for people to acquire it more easily.

Yeah. 70 minutes later. Maybe they are waiting for 6 confirmations or something like that. I just torrented the file and watched it.

Any interest in buying Minke Whale meat with bitcoins? Sold in every supermarket here in Iceland. Delicious.

Do they manually send out the links? I bought the film 10 minutes ago and never got a link. Guess I will have to torrent it.

This is not a final ruling by the ECJ. It is however a good sign that the Advocate General is of this opinion.

Well they can sell them on an exchange and wire the money to any one of those traditional bank accounts they have.

The crowd-sourced constitution is a myth. It was written by a bunch of media types and celebrities. We really dodged a bullet there. It was a nightmare. Property rights and civil liberties replaced by socialism and pseudo-rights.

Thank you!

We have a fixed amount of foreign currency we can buy if we travel overseas. We have to show a valid airline ticket at the bank to be able to buy about $2,900 worth of foreign fiat. We are also obliged to sell the foreign currency to the bank when we return to the country.
Totally insane.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:45:25
Exactly. Iceland, China and Argentina have capital controls in place. This should surprise no-one.

@_date: 2013-12-19 15:39:28
The controls are structured in a certain way relating to Iceland's balance of payments. Everything relating to the current account, i.e. buying goods and services, from "foreign entities" is allowed, except when expressly forbidden. Everything relating to the capital account, i.e. capital flows and investment, to "foreign entities" is forbidden, except when expressly allowed.
The Bank considers exchanging Icelandic currency for Bitcoin to be a capital flow out of the country. Thus it considers it illegal, regardless of whether bitcoin is a currency, commodity or something else altogether.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:22:52
This is the Bank's interpretation of the Foreign Exchange Act. As you can see, it's scope is not limited to foreign currencies.

There are none for sale at the moment at localbitcoins.
Icelanders in the USA will not be able to receive payment from Icelanders in Iceland, since the latter will not be able to wire any funds to the US.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:46:47
This is the Central Bank. Equivalent to the Fed in the US. The Central Bank is part of the government, it has regulatory powers, powers to investigate people and businesses and refer cases to the prosecutor.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:31:48
I am baffled as to why people think Iceland is some kind of free speech haven. This is fantasy. We don't have real protection in our constitution or in practice.

Sorry I don't have a link. This was part of a successful campaign by the InDefence group ( to pressure the President to hold a referendum to nullify the bail out laws enacted by the government and parliamentary majority at the time.
The event was a success, the President ordered a referendum. The Prime Minister and the rest of the government were furious. They were eventually voted out this year, replaced by the opposition, some of whom had been part of the InDefence group. The President re-elected by a landslide because of this.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:56:25
Incorrect. The people were asking for a referendum on whether Iceland should bail out foreign depositors in the fallen banks. They got their referendum and rejected the bail out. The president is regarded as a hero by the people in the pic.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:39:24
Yes, if it involves capital movement from a domestic party to a foreign party. Investing in anything foreign is forbidden as a general rule.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:59:36
No. My post is not supposed to be negative for Bitcoin. I love Bitcoin. Would like to take part. Can't because of this.
That is the point of this post.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:36:00
No, it is factual. Trading in bitcoin is illegal. So is trading in gold, silver, commodities, stocks, bonds and the likes. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:12:32
You can buy goods and services legally. But bitcoin is considered a capital transaction. Such transactions are generally illegal, as per the quoted article.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:21:40
This post is not supposed to be negative, just informative. News of this is not a surprise to anyone in Iceland. Just wanted to report the situation to the rest of the world. Thus my first post.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:44:43
If you want to spend your holiday selling bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:40:37
You are correct. Or I could just IM them on facebook, as one does from time to time.
Most MP's want to get rid of the capital controls. They don't want to ban bitcoin trading. They are however faced with enormous amounts of capital trying to escape the country. That is why we are in this situation.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:15:26
They will probably make this illegal if it were to catch on.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:52:18
Mining is legal, since it does not involve capital flow out of the country.
It is probably not illegal (yet) to sell goods and services for bitcoin. The government may try to force people to sell their bitcoins for the national fiat currency, króna, as they do with other foreign currency.
It is only illegal to buy bitcoin with cash (it is almost impossible, since bank transfers out of the country are restricted, and you can't buy bitcoin safely with CC).

@_date: 2013-12-19 19:00:58
Yes. As of now. They may crack down on that if it becomes a problem [in their view].
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:55:26
My guess is that you are safe as long as you buy from a local. For all you know, the seller is just selling his domestically mined coins. There seems to be a loophole there. You can however not buy foreign currency from a local or foreigner, that is illegal. But bitcoin is not classified as a currency.  So those restrictions should not apply.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:32:48
The law applies to movement of capital. Such as buying gold, silver, stocks, bonds or anything of value such as bitcoin. It is not limited to foreign currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:45:00
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:57:32
The Central Bank has the power to monitor CC transactions. It has an automated dragnet in place to catch capital flight.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:54:08
The Central Bank of Iceland is part of the government and is ultimately under the administration of the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs. It regulates capital flows in and out of the country. It also regulates the banks in this regard.
The article is not intended to stir up controversy or mislead people. It is quite proper to alert people to the fact that the Central Bank regards trading cash for bitcoin illegal. It will thus stand in the way of banks, businesses and persons wanting to take advantage of this revolutionary new technology. It follows that it will refer what it deems to be illegal activity to the relevant authority for prosecution. People need to know this.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:53:12
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:12:40
I have not seen any response from the government. The article is factual. There are strict capital controls in Iceland. All foreign exchange trading is restricted.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:33:53
Correct. This means nothing for the rest of the world. Just bad for us Icelanders.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:10:07
Well, this is the first official response from the CB about Bitcoin. I would have been amazed if they had said it was legal. So it is no surprise at all to Icelanders.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:25:07
That seems to be what the CB is saying.
The CB gets all data about CC transactions from the banks. It sifts through the data to try to find illegal transactions. If they think you are breaking the law, they will investigate you and refer your case to the prosecutor. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:17:12
Yeah, probably.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:11:07
It is perfectly legal to buy goods and services. It is probably also legal to buy bitcoin if you intend to spend it all immediately to buy goods and services. But you can not invest in foreign assets, including bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:10:01
This is not specific to bitcoin. The same would apply to investing in gold, stocks or even a racehorse. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:09:46
This article is based on an official response by the CB to a journalist. Thus, it is the official position of the regulator at this point in time. The position is in line with current government policy which is ever tightening capital controls. There is no question about this.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:11:29
This means they classified buying bitcoin as a capital movement out of the country. Just like buying stocks, bonds or commodities. Does not mean bitcoin is classified as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:57:31
No. This says nothing about it's classification. The only thing the CB is looking at is whether there is capital movement out of the country involved. Such movements are restricted.
