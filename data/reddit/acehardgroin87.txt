Boo. Amazon = centralization

Yeah there seems to be a language barrier in the article. I think this is what they mean.
Good news either way, anything that makes it easier for the average consumer.

+$200 in what, 20 minutes?
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:57:17
Lmfao these comments

Someone ELI5.
Does this mean that we’ll be able to buy right after initiating a bank transfer (offering better control of buy prices), but must wait for the funds to settle from the bank before we can actually withdraw the crypto from Coinbase? (To a wallet, etc)

yes we had nothing to do with the Korean War ending

It was not a tweet, it was a reply. They always get less attention than individual tweets/threads

$250 jump in like 15 minutes
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:13:03
With the $7k hover for almost 24h, I think it’s possible we’ve reached the bottom.

You should wake up. It is literally the SA government’s POLICY to take land from WHITES (not farmers, not rich people, but WHITE PEOPLE). 
This is a more serious issue than just artificial cultural racial tension generated by mass media propaganda like in the US and other western nations that you’re referring to.

I don’t quite understand.
I have my bank account linked and am able to purchase directly from it on Coinbase *with a locked in price*, regardless of how long the bank transfer takes.
I assumed that perk was what makes their fees so high.
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:44:09
Oh okay, fair enough. I guess the fee is just for the convenience of not having to do a limit order.
I should start using GDAX

Breathing down 7k’s neck! Bull run coming.
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:27:21
Only .28% of the population have dipped their toes in.
Think about that. And most coins have already been mined and/or lost.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:55:39
Not sure why you’re being downvoted. Just sounds like you have more faith in fiat currencies and the status quo than a lot of people in the crypto community, which is perfectly fair.
Personally, I see no reason that adoption rate would do anything but increase over time, even if it takes a while. That’s how things are with any new tech.
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:40:29
That’s like going on T_D and being like “yo any Trump supporters here?”

What’s your current average buy price?
@_date: 2018-11-12 04:58:57
“Buy this thing that I have a heavily vested interest in you buying”
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:29:10
I guess I set myself up for this one.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:21:52
The vast majority of BTC purchases are in Asia
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:30:38
Yeah I made some poor selling decisions at first, but now I’m in the groove.
Do you use the app “Delta”? It’s a great way to track your portfolio, including average buy/sell prices.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:19:17
Anyone using Dollar Cost Average instead of large investments?
I got in during the bubble sadly, and my current average purchase price is $11.3k and dropping. However, I have faith in the technology and believe it would take something like Coinbase being exposed as a fraud and going down or collaboration between powerful governments to prevent the BTC adoption rate from increasing.
Who’s been DCA’ing BTC for longer than I have, and how’s it going for you?
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:23:46
Trump beating the World War III drums is the best thing to happen to BTC so far this year.
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:14:34
I am only 20&amp; down now and it's an amazing feeling. \(Got in November the first time we hit $10K\)
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:07:19
Congrats! If even just 5% of the world were to adopt BTC, you’d be a part of the ultra rich.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:37:27
I disagree. I also haven’t invested a large chunk of my savings/net worth though, to be fair. Just DCA’ing.
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:07:46
How much BTC did you pay?
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:56:17
How come? More reasonable than, for example,20%, surely. Right?
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:29:53
Oh boy I wanna buy but I’m out of fiat for a couple weeks �� (this is the Bitcoiner’s way of saying ‘I’m broke’ while preserving any possible dignity)
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:04:15
In my opinion, adoption rates will only go up over time. It would take an extinction level event such as the world’s biggest governments collaborating against it to end it for good.
*in my opinion*
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:53:43
My comment was really just to point out the fact that owning 1 out of all 21m BTC that will ever exist (not taking into account those that have been lost unrecoverably) will make this guy rich if we ever have mass adoption.
5% was mild hyperbole, as it’s just under the entire population of the US.
That said, adoption rates in Asia are much higher. So we’ll see.

Just wish I had gotten in earlier. Current average buy price is $10.2k lol
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:00:33
Bias is just as strong in the other direction for those who’ve failed/ are failing 
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:18:48
I’m DCA’ing and we’re almost up to my average buy price. Delta is an awesome app
