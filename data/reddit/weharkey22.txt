Yeah, bitcoin is probably just bogged down with such high volume. Give it another 12 hours and then start making phone calls. 
Future advice: don’t use bitcoin. My personal opinion

Probably a long time (at least 30 minutes) which is why you should use ethereum or litecoin where transfer fees are a fraction of the price and speed is 20x faster.

If you have a coinbase account, set up a gdax account. Gdax is owned by coinbase and is a trading platform where you can ultimately pay zero fees in buying/selling. Watch a YouTube video on it. Very easy

Fees on poloniex are 0.25% on buys and 0.15% on sells, so yes, much better than coinbase.

The price of bitcoin is determined by the people. It’s is what it is at today because people are buying it at that price. If the price goes up then there are more buyers than sellers. If the price goes down, there are more sellers than buyers. 
Simple economics.

Coinbase was a fantastic app/crypto exchange for a long time. Lately the app has become the most downloaded app in the United States and this has caused the platform to become extremely bogged down. They added a fourth coin to their exchange (Bitcoin Cash) last week, and this once again caused problems for the network. Until the team at coinbase can make upgrades for the increased demand, I would recommend using another exchange. I personally use poloniex which I have found to be good. Poloniex offers many different coins and many nice features.
