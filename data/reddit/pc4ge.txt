No- assholes are going to laugh, and others have clearly tried to give reasonable advice. You just want to sit on your “I survived a 94% dip so I’m tough and can handle bitcoin” high horse, and are just being a douchebag to people who may not know exactly wha they are doing. 
Maybe, next time someone doesn’t know as much as you asking for help/advice, consider you can post an article or blog that you might find helpful instead of being a jerk.

So I am curious, how did you come up with this target and specifically using March? Trying to understand how people make projections like this and what tools they use :-)

You know, I can’t find the initial reply you made to my post here... hmm, that’s weird, it’s almost like you were trying to cover up being a dick. Go troll somewhere else man, gtfo.

From your comment history in another thread:
What if I pointed out the shocking but true statistic that over 40% of newborns in France have two non-White parents?  Given that fact, plus a reasonable assumption that the French will continue to be unable to close their borders, what if I pointed out that the only relatively peaceful way to save Germany, Sweden, France, and the UK from Islam required the immediate expulsion of all muslims.  What if I pointed out that the only possible alternative was a brutal civil war that ended in heavy losses for the victor, and total genocide for the loser?
Yuuuup. Yup. Definitely an asshole. ✌��

Thanks for the advice- maybe trading on alts makes more sense to check more frequently with a good bit of research before pulling the trigger.

Thanks for those of you with constructive comments and advice on maintaining sanity. 
To the others who are telling me “chill out it’s not a big loss” or to use a time machine, or just being salty in general for literally no reason- you guys are seriously toxic to this community. Consider **I’m a fucking newbie** with limited experience, and just a sliver of skin in the game. I didn’t post to get shit on. Your behavior just drives us new investors to just watch YouTube videos that are probably shills just to avoid some of you assholes. Cut it the fuck out.
