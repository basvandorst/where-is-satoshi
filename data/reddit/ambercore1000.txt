Emm... i Trust that LassPass is a better solution to some people than just remembering passwords. But in the end i don't trust any 3th party company with my passwords. Personalty i use Keepass as i am the one in control of my keys. If you feel secure having a company watching over all of your passwords and if this works for you then that's better than using the same key everywhere. But in our world we here often that people using secure and trusted places are getting screwed over. If i ever get screwed over then i know that its my own fault for not being careful.
Having my 2FA cores stored on paper in 2 secure locations makes me sleep better at night than knowing that one fault at LassPass will doom all of my keys. Or worse, giving people access to BOTH my keys and 2FA at the same time. Having all of your eggs in one basket may not be the best thing to do. 
But i'm glad that you brought it to my attantion. I did not know they had that option! :)

Will answer later, on my way home from work. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:10:19
Huh? That seems strange, maybe u/kraken-iain can chime in with information about this? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:05:41
I would not say that they were unsecure, Either they block access to crucial controls in your exchange account for X amount of days, informs you by email that you account has been changed (And you need to take action) and 2 factor Auth has been disabled. (Besides people would need to spoof my email, granted that is not hard)
Or the sites have had a separate account on their Zendesk (Support site) where you can provide confidential information securely over HTTPS.
The reason that i'm having trouble is because Kraken is not set up to handle costumers that are locked out of their account in a secure way and their staff is servilely under trained for the situation where someone that knows just basic safety contacts them. Their personal think that deleting a email after sending it makes it secure.

Hello Dude!
I can see that you have cancelled your Kickstarter. I hope that it is in the process of you making a better and more secure product and relaunching it again. I know that when you have worked hard on something its not easy to see faults in the product that you are producing, and i wish that in your update you would have reflected inwards instead of giving other people the blame for your product being candled. I any case i will continue see if you make a new kickstarter with a similar product that is secure as i could see a use of what you are making.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:22:15
Wow! Realy?
Wrote bitfinex with my issue, they disabled 2fa right away and locked my account for a week. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:18:25
Hello Iain.
Thank you for the reply, it makes sense in almost all cases besides cases where users are not able to access their account since the will not be able to log into your support site. Take a look at how your competitors are handling this. They have a separate main user and a Zendesk user. This way users can send secure and encrypted messages to their support.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:53:23
But why spread your information out to a 3th party source that stores your keys? How do Authy make money by storing your keys? How do you know that your keys are safe and that Authy not have any backdoors? 
If you go with Google then you know what you sign up for. There are regulations in place to govern how they need to secure your information, its a known and "Trusted" corporation. Today is the first time i have ever heard about Authy.
You could also go with a Open source alternative, That way you were sure that the keys you enable in the authenticator app is only controlled by you.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:52:14
Okay, so that means that when you state "Metal foil Bitcoin wallets" that means that you are selling a sticker that people can print their own wallet to? You are kind of vague on your kickstarter about how one would use your product? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:58:35
They claim they are encrypted, But as long as they are closed source then you do not know if thy in fact are. Authy could have backdoors either for support, or specified my governments. backdoors that can be taken advantages of my people with malicious intend. I will not trust them with my last line of defence to my accounts.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:03:14
Please see my response to Svcvac: 
I do not trust them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:41:24
Well colour me impressed. I don goofed again.
I did what you asked. (Because i did not think about it before.) And guess what was send to me in plain text, not encrypted from your to my mail server? All of my sensitive information. What good does it do to have a support site where i have a secure encrypted connection when you just forward my message to me in plain text?
I let my guard down for 2 seconds and did not think as i normally would and put my self in the situation that i was trying to avoid.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:01:01
That's not the issue, it someone did catch your information in the emails you have send then they could use it against you on any service, not just kraken. And deleteing the emails does nothing. :P
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:56:46
Well i'm going to do this going forward.
I'm just glad that my other services were great and quick at helping me get my account up and running again.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:34:37
Yes, but providing this via unencrypted email is not a smart move. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:29:18
Hello Svcvac.
I understand the convenience of using a service like authy, but i simply do not trust anyone with my 2FA codes. There are to many variables that i cannot control if i'm using a 3th party service. What if their company goes bankrupt, what if they are hacked, (Just because they claim your content is encrypted does not mean that its secure) What if their mobile application is compromised? I do not trust 3th party's in cases when it comes to security. But hey, if you are happy with them then i wont rain on your parade. :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:25:43
That is a good strategy! Remember to keep your prints at 2 different location in case of fire or other major incidents! :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:20:52
I all comes down to trade off's. 
Security vs ease of use.
With systems where your account gets neutered for a week and  get notified about your 2FA situation you are the one that needs to act if something is wrong. And most people (At least people that uses exchanges) makes sure to check their email account atleast once a week.
And having a totally separate login that is not tied directly to your account where you cant disable anything, but instead provide identification in a secure way.
Is in my opinion a better solution than to ask users to send detailed personal information over a unsecure email connection.
None of the scenarios are good or okay, but they are better than Krakens scenario.
Regarding Kraken putting a watermark on documents are a great thing no doubt about that! but the issue is that they ask people to provide them with sensitive information over unsecure email.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:31:37
Please see my response to Svcvac: 
I do not trust them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:17
My main issue is that i want to see my previous transactions. Maybe create a new ticket with them and link them to this post? (in all honesty, i would also recommend another service than kraken.) 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:24:54
Having this information off digital devices that ensures that only i can control who has access to my stuff in case of a breach. Not saying that people would take the time to decrypt my files. Just saying that i feel more secure not having this tied to digital files.
I will in the future print out the QR codes and keep it in 2 separate locations in case of fire or other incidents.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:02:06
Unless your phone or the place that stores the photo gets compromised. Or lost. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:58:47
I have send you a private message. I'm hoping that you (Kraken) are going to take security more serious. Emails is not a secure form of communication. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:10:27
Remember this is just a marketing person. He knows nothing about how tge rest of the company works. ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:53:38
Well i'm not angry at all, I'm trying to give you a helping hand. I like the idea of your product but think you are missing the mark in making sure that people wont need to trust you.
First of all i really think you should reconsider the approach you are going with the pre-made wallet on the sticker. For both the users and your sake. If you are creating the wallets then people will need to put their trust in you, this goes against what Crypto Currency is all about. Crypto Currency is not about being able to trust everyone its about not having to trust anyone.
In any (Most, Some wallets function differently) wallet application that you install on your phone or your computer the application creates the Bitcoin Wallet during first start up. The private keys are then saved locally on the phone and is not (should not be) available to anyone else than the user. If you purchase a hardware wallet then you will be asked to create a Bitcoin wallet during first boot. This way you wont have to trust the company that has created the Hardware wallet. Its the same thing with Bitcoinpapaerwallet (dot) com. You are making sure that you are creating the paper wallet in a secure environment where you don't have to trust any external sources other than yourself in who has access to the Private key.
I know that you state that you want this to be easy for new adopter and i would agree. This should be easy, but more importantly also secure, (Security should be your MAIN concern, again both for your and your costumers sake) and it is in most cases easy and secure if you install a application on your phone or your computer as you are the keeper of your Private keys. (Most Wallet Applications are open source. The Bitcoin community would quickly figure out if some of the companies was up to no good.)
Now, i have mentioned a couple of times that you should be really concerned in regards to have created the wallets. If a person has his bitcoins stolen from the wallet you provide (Or multiple people) what is then stopping him from creating a lawsuit against you? You cannot prove without 100% doubt that you have destroyed all private keys.
My best advice is that you must adapt so users wont have to trust you, this way you CANT be involved if people loses Bitcoin and users can sleep tight knowing that only they are the masters of their Private keys.
I'm concerned for you being involved in lawsuit's but more importantly I'm concerned that uses loosing bitcoin because of you.
Edit: If you decide to change your business strategy so its the people purchasing the product who is responsible for the Private Keys then i maybe would be interested in purchasing your product, But until that day i would not touch your product with a 10 foot pole. It has all of the wrong marking and no reason for me to take the risk.
Edit2: I have donated to your kickstarter and left a comment regarding my concerns with your product. I want you to succeed in life i really do. But it bothers me that you are so layed back in regards to security with your product.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:05:18
You will have to disable 2FA from your account, then enable it again to see the QR code.
My recommendation is to save it either in a bank box or in 2 separate and secure locations where only you have access to it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:20:56
The reason people are angry is because they don't want anyone else than themselves to have created or seen the private keys. Take a look at bitcoinpaperwallet dot com about how they handle the creation of these kinds fo wallets. Then you will get a idear about good practices in regards to non electronic wallets. ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:22:25
Maybe, but if we have the option with the technology then why not be as paranoid as possible. This is a non issue at every other exchange (3-4 others that i have gone through this process with) and should have been resolved with the first email.
The chance that someone is viewing my emails send to Kraken is closer to 0 than something. But again WHY take the chance? If everyone were as paranoid as i am then security would be top notch everywhere because of cases like this.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:51:50
Wait? I cant quite read this fron your kickstarter, but are these wallets premade before a user receives them? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:08:04
That is true. That is why I'm making sure that in the future this is not going to be a problem again. I have learned a lot by having this issue, and hopefully this will be a wakeup call for Kraken about changing procedure and training their staff.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:59:37
Print out the QR code. Store it in a secure location.
That is properly your best bet.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:25:59
Let me take a small part of my earlier reply and paste it here. Because i think you got this all wrong.


Most wallets are open source and Bitcoin users work together to make sure that creators of these wallets are not bamboozling the people that are using the wallets. You need to reflect inwards and take constructive criticism to heart. Most people here are trying really hard to help you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:57:43
You cannot find a backup code when you have set up your 2FA. You will need to disable it, enable it, and save is a secure place. (I would recommend printing it out so its not digital.)
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:09:21
Even if its connected via ethernet it could be vulnerable. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:29:51
Is a false positive, although I wish it wasn't. :-D
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:28:22
Blockfolio keeps track of what I have bought and sold manually. It is not directly connected to my bitcoins. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:35:31
It would be wonderful if it was true! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:36:48
There is no link to private or public keys, you simply input when you bought cryptocurrency, at what exchange and at what price, then it keeps track of it.:-)
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:29:09
Hmm, kraken's Api most be toast then. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:22:48
What is wrong with jaxx? Seen a lot of people saying great and bad thing about it, but I have never gotten a clean answer?
