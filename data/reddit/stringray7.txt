If you keep your coins on an exchange, get used to waiting much longer than normal for them to "batch" send your coins at their convenience.  Keep them in your own wallet and you decide.  Depending on what fee you choose to apply, it can take less than 10-20 minutes.  Keep in mind that they can choose to be slow to receive too.  This is not strictly a Bitcoin problem.

I stopped mining in the latter half of 2013 when it became less-than-profitable for what I was willing to spend in hardware/electricity/time.  I also remember fondly selling several BTC for less than $100 to Mt. Gox (still have some old wire receipts to remind me).  Anyway, life happens and I moved on and when I think back about how much that would all be worth now, it's made it MUCH easier to HODL what I have currently invested and I have nothing but high hopes for the future of this remarkable p2p technology.  Thanks for helping to bolster my attitude!
