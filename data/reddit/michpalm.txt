The price was rising with the increase in activity of the Chinese exchanges, but the price exploded in November '13 right after the US Senate hearings which were largely positive. Also the run up into the April '13 Price increase could have been associated with FinCEN issuing guidelines on Bitcoin in March '13. Not saying China doesn't affect the price. It obviously does. But US laws do affect the price considerably.

I agree there has to be a discussion and that involves politics. I'm not opposed to that, but it's tough when the comments section is filled with remarks that can really alienate people without actually explaining positions or allowing for discussion.  The thing is, bitcoin can be used in many ways, and while many parts of how it works vibe with libertarians, it's not inherently libertarian. I have seen some good discussions here, so I don't want to dismiss that. I just wish there was more of it.

I think I can answer  Halving refers to the amount of bitcoin rewarded to miners when they mine a block. Every set amount of years, the reward is split in half. Right now Miners recieve 25 BTC until sometime in 2016 when it will become 12.5. This will continue until 2110-2140 when no more [new] coins will be given out to miners.
If the network is still around by the year 2140, the theory is that miners will then be able to rely solely on network fees as an incentive to continue mining.

I think you are not alone at all. I was initially intrigued by Bitcoin for the sheer thrill of being able to tip someone enough change for a coffee just by posting under their comment. The ability to send funds from one place to another instantly is fascinating.  I love the idea of a technology that can empower individuals to essentially be their own bank, and to have an asset with a predetermined inflation rate. There's so much promise especially when you also consider metacoins like Mastercoin, BitShares, etc.  
I'm not arguing that bitcoin doesn't hold promise for Libertarians. But I do get turned off by one liner talking points, repetitive simple mantras, and claims that this technology has to fall squarely within one political position. It doesn't. The problem is pretty much the same everywhere. It's hard to have political discussions and they often degrade because people get emotional and it can get ugly. So when there is a loud group in one place, people who don't completely agree tend to keep quiet.

An idea that I think could be realistically done in a short amount of time:
Plan for each group to record themselves at their next meetup. They can greet the world and as a group give one reason for why they come together/ why they believe in Bitcoin. Someone can then edit the videos together to create one video that showcases people around the globe supporting a common idea.  The connections made while working on this simple project can be helpful in promoting more complicated projects in the future. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 21:28:16
This concept took me awhile to understand. But once I did I was pretty amazed by it. When you send money to the public address of your paper wallet, that public address now has the coins and is visible on the blockchain. You just can't move the coins from the paperwallet until you import the private keys. So if done right, your coins are secure so long as you keep the paperwallet safe. But you can still see how much you have by adding the public address to watch only.

I think he hit the nail on the head when he talks about the inevitable moment someone comes up with a killer application that uses Bitcoin. There are already a ton of great features, but I think something like bitcointip is going in the right direction. Like something that allows you to essentially 'carry' your wallet to any website you want that has a user base, and gives you the ability to exchange BTC to any user regardless of whether they have a wallet set up yet or not.
When something like that becomes available and easily useable, I will be using bitcoin forever.

"Then you'll start to see their eyes start to get a little wider, they start to listen a little more intently. Suddenly you're not talking about some imaginary currency that some hacker made up, but a useful tool that can make their lives easier."
I was that person a few weeks ago. I knew about it for years, but only tried to really understand it recently. Once I did, whoa man, I was convinced this form of exchange is the future.  I'm being very cautious with this, but the more I dip my toes in the water the more I want to swim.
It's not just a very useful and convenient tool. It has a beautiful potential to change lives. What happens with it in the future depends on how people treat it. And I have no clue what the results will be, but the potential for crypto is huge.

I will completely admit in many ways that's what I'm doing. I'm totally reacting to the crazy increase in exchange rates and the giant bump in attention. And can you blame me? It's like a giant shiny flashing beacon screaming "somethings happening here!"  
I'm also kicking myself for not investigating this sooner on my own. I wish I had really researched this and made a small risk investment in something that I had found interesting when it was so cheap.  
That being said I'm also being careful and experimented with transferring (very) small funds. It was a lot smoother than I was expecting. I think the thing that truly sold me was the tip feature on reddit. I can actually see this becoming a normal means of exchange on the internet at the very least. 
I guess I'm making a judgement call half based on logic and half based on lizard brain mob mentality. I guess I'm human :)

I agree Mastercoin is one thing I'm excited about, and pretty much every project that's aiming for a decentralized exchange network is fascinating to me.

I'm pretty sure ripple is not a project specifically dedicated to improve Bitcoin exchanges, but it will result in that. From playing with ripple it's very obvious it will allow you much greater access and control as to where and what you would like to exchange. As more "gateways" (aka exchanges) sign up to the ripple network, more options for exchange will be available. In a sense it creates a distributed network of exchanges. XRP will make it much easier to move between options but any currency can be exchanged which is why I'm keeping my eye on it. If people begin to use the ripple network, it will allow users to move to different exchanges quickly, possibly allowing an gateway that is under too heavy a load to have it's demands lightened since people will probably want to switch to an exchange that isn't bogged down. It might also create more consistency between exchange prices since people will immediately swoop on better deals evening out the disparity. 
If I am making no sense or said something that isn't right please chime in. I am speakin' from the limited experience I have playing with the system and reading about it. I am sure others have a better understanding.

I sold one item (a silver coin set) on BitMit so far for bitcoin. I shipped it but haven't gotten the BTC yet (escrow still pending). And today I just made my first purchase with BTC: Reddit Gold. I would never have bought Reddit Gold but I noticed they accepted BTC so I did it for the novelty. It was even easier than paypal.
The ease of online use is where I'm sold. I have basically nothing in BTC because I'm just trying it out. But the notoriety it has gained in the past few weeks can be great if the value begins to stabilize. If I had more disposable income to convert I would, but right now I'm playing with peanuts. I'm not sure if Bitcoin is the currency everyone will rally behind, but I do believe there will be a currency like Bitcoin that will become a major international player. I also believe "niche crypto currencies" will sprout up and influence smaller specified markets. It really depends on the merchants accepting BTC and services like Mt.Gox becoming more reliable.
**TL;DR: I used to dismiss BTC. Tried it out. Convinced Crypto will be a major part of our lives in the future- not sure when or in what form.**
