Does anyone still think it's a currency? It's almost solely a commodity now, but that's why financial institutions are afraid of it. It's no secret that Chinese and Russian millionaires have been buying bitcoin to avoid taxes (like they've done with property in London, Australia and North America).  Every dollar invested in Bitcoin (and other cryptos) is one not going in a bank and that worries banks.
It'd be interesting to see how much has been spent on various cryptos (not their current value, but how much they were bought for) to see how much has been invested in them instead of in banks

So - unless I'm missing something - the summary of this is:
* "the nation’s financial institutions [are] not to deal with bitcoin" - well, the whole advantage of Bitcoin is that we circumvent banks, no?
* "the bank didn’t ban trading platforms, such as BTC China, from dealing with bitcoin and other digital currencies, it merely said these companies have to register with authorities." - so, just like any normal currency exchange business?
* "The trading platforms were also told that user anonymity is not permitted – the exchanges must receive identification documents from their customers" - again, just like any legitimate currency exchange
* "they must report any suspicious transactions to the authorities." - and, again, just like any other currency exchange
From what I can see, this release doesn't actually underrmine Bitcoin in anyway and, in fact, cements it as a legitimate trading platform with the regulation to make it so.
Or am I missing something?
