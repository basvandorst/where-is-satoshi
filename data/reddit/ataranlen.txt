Many of these shirts are flipping awesome!
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:46:02
Could you add widgets?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:47:59
I could maybe help with that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:45:52
I don't think that was his original plan, but it *could* accomplish the same goal of allowing bitcoin to become the largest payment processor in the world. 
Edit: Misread that, sorry. In short, yes. The main issue is getting the network to agree on an implementation plan/timeframe.

Doctors without borders could use some funds, but I don't see a bitcoin donation option.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:25:35
Because Satoshi's 'phase change' plan for increasing the block size limit was never implemented.
@_date: 2015-12-19 07:21:54
I thought it was 1.1 trillion?
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:06:26
Haha, they fixed it already.
It was in the div.boxes, they were overflowing their bounds, and being covered by the div

As a follow up, their email system doesn't work.




@_date: 2014-06-14 03:29:04
Yeah, they accept Bitcoins through BitPay.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:33:18
I'm so excited by this, I refuse to clap slowly.

This is a relevant discussion about the price that says we shouldn't waste our time talking about the price. This discussion is relevant at all times, no matter the price, and those of us who see it now will not waste time talking about the price later. This solidifies the discussion impact months or even years from now.

Hey I already asked this on Facebook, but could I drive down to my local TigerDirect.com store and pay at checkout with Bitcoins too?
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:37:09
"The total price for wishlist should be less then $1250"
Yeah, no thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-13 12:55:34
It's not really collected so much as emailed to an  email address. seriously, just drop a ';' in the password field. They're running the site off of what appears to be an IIS server, too.

I keep getting tons of phishing emails, I've narrowed it down to the Bitcoin Black Friday email list being compromised as the source of most of them.

Ugghhh, that broken CSS scares me away.

From a response on their facebook:

He made 101 of them. I wonder if he has pictures up of each one?
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:27:28
So did they just refuse payment from Canadian customers before now? /s
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:32:43
Still no in-store acceptance of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:51:30
I just sent a lengthy email to CampaignBird.com explaining the situation. I'm going to guess using their software for malicious purposes violated their Anti-Spam Policy and their Terms of Use. I advised them to follow up with legal action against the instigator of that email.

But I can't add it to my portfolio and track my current wealth.
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:07:32
I cross posted the main image to [because of this comment.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:50:08
Or a few casascius coins
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:11:28
1 reason my business should not be accepting bitcoin: My customers have no idea what it is or how to use it.
My business has accepted bitcoin for 6 years. Haven't had a single customer use it.

If the owner paid $6 for each of the coins and the machine is selling them for $7 then the owner will still make profit, even if the price goes up.

I'm not convinced this is real

I still remember being in IRC a few years ago, and someone wanted to track him down. After a bit of investigation, I got to see that new BMW he bought himself.

And this is why I love gmail, and the ability to have unique emails for each site.
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:24:44
Sounds like this service needs to be rebuilt
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:06:58
I took a moment, and found [this which says otherwise](
Clicking the [Bitcoin option still works, too.](
Edit: You're referring to subscribing to gold for yourself. I see what you mean, now.
You can't have a recurring subscription with Bitcoin. Select the [One time payment option](
Edit 2: [Image](
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:20:25
You cannot, and never have been able to, set up an auto-renewing Reddit Gold Subscription with Bitcoin.
Nothing has changed.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:14:49
If you list on MtGox for lower than current buy prices, doesn't it just sell to the current Highest buy orders until they get down to the price you set?
Does BTC-E work differently?
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:27:38
Just had a company ask about a payment service that supported Volusion. If you get it running, It sounds like they'd consider signing up with you.
@_date: 2013-02-14 21:03:24
I was one of the people who got that response through email.

I've never used Gyft.com, but I might in the future with this news :o
