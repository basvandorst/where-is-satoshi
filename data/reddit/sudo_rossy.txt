I've tried several times with them (UK), really awful success rate, my bitcoins always go away, but I rarely get my pizza. I'm talking a 10-20% success rate without exaggeration.
I get refunds (in Gbp but understandable as they're using a processor), but a drawn-out withdrawl of my bitcoins isn't quite the same as a pizza.

Quick! Op! You sell Ferraris now !

Keeping and spending if I can! 
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:19:38
You're right. Still, that's a lot of money 
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:57:21
That's a pretty nice system, I can see something like this working in the future

Buy a bunch of bitcoin
Make your idea reality (talk to those people you said need to cooperate or w/e)
Then come back and laugh at us.

It's not better with Cash, but many different pizza places and half the time they don't even get the order. 
I'm guessing like you said, it's probably because Just-eat has more money for a better infrastructure.

0.25BTC an hour for driving lessons?! Alright for some...

I'm the only full-time employee at my business, I normally just count myself as software developer, but quite often I have to say I'm the MD/CEO/Whatever. It basically just means "owner". Eventually you sort of get in the habit of saying that.

Someone should get Scan Computers on the case. They're a cool company (usually willing to adopt stuff like this), and they're pretty large in the UK, but with being only 1 physical store, it's probably easy for them to role out.
Totally not biased by being local :p

I'm a northerner with Android/iOS But I can develop for WP. That being said, there should definitely be an app out there. I'll keep this thread in mind, and I can get you to test on your device? I've only developed with the Emulator, but it's apparently been fine so far. Nothing beats a real device though.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:14:51
Give them time, jeez.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:23:13
Completely speculative, but this would be an interesting (if not completely useless) usage for a sort of botnet. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:52:56
I'm really intrigued as to what's going to happen. This is better than TV! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:55:15
I don't know if you're interested, but I'm an Android &amp; iOS app developer. I could make an app for your store so people can buy with it.. I can do a discount if you pay in BTC as well :)
Either way, you make some seriously cool looking stuff! Keep it up!

How exactly is NFC inherently insecure for this application? I'm curious.
I used to work with NFC based payment, so I think it's viable.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:33:25
I'm very, very new to Bitcoin, but couldn't you just keep transferring the excess out say once a week, keeping your balance around $50? You could probably code a bot to do it pretty easily.

Whether this ends up being good or bad, It's going to be a fun ride!
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:41:02
Thanks :D
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:14:28
People in the Bitcoin community like giving, and some people are poor. Seems like a nice solution to me.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:56:33
I'll be doing the first two things, and I do the third already. Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:45:07
Looks like we're back over $1,000! That was fun
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:19:40
When I made the post, it'd dropped around $100. Granted, it bounced back pretty quickly, I didn't know what was going to happen either way. Glad it bounced back, my 0.011BTC just became worth a little more!
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:19:44
Doesn't one of the bitcoin apps support NFC payments? 
In fact, couldn't we adapt for example: Mifare NFC cards for this kind of thing? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:31:41
My main problem right now is that bitcoin wise - I'm poor.
I'm not really willing to put fiat currency into bitcoin right now, so I'm earning it through some mining, maybe services to someone and such.
I'd really like if I could get to a self sufficient point without using any of my fiat currency. My work lends itself well to being paid in bitcoin, so it's a fun little experiment too.
That being said, I'm not using Bitcoin for its value against other currencies, I'm pretty much spending most of what I get.

I was looking at the bitcoin tip bot's posts, and saw one of them was for 56BTC. It was $7,500 at the time, but jeez. That's $56,000 now. A heck of a lot.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:37:16
I'm not familiar with the Bitcoin API, but I know how to make WP apps. I might give it a try. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:29:21
This looks really cool, when I've got a couple more mBTC I'm definitely treating myself to pizza!

We've been to the moon. Now we're returning home for a bit to prep for the mars mission ;) 
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:50:28
I think the Bitcoin community isn't a good representation of the general population. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:05:32
It'd be pretty cool if it was linked to their API so it auto-calculated.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:50:03
I'll respond.
You were downvoted because "ha" doesn't add anything to the discussion.
And you were likely downvoted again because you complained.

I hear if 3 levels of comments from different people mention he appears. Similar to Beetlejuice.
