Hi there, please see our latest announcement from our blog post here:
"We have made significant progress in the last week with the system upgrades and have realized moderate improvement in performance.  Unfortunately, we were not able to complete all of the upgrades and the most impactful measures are yet to come.  For the time being, systems should still be considered degraded and unreliable.  Our team is working through the weekend and holidays to accelerate our timeline."
You can escalate your ticket here: 
Please note that we are experiencing a lot of transactions at the moment. The funds are not missing, they are just processing in our AML system. Escalating your ticket will not expedite the resolution of the error, but you will get a response from our CS team. We are aware of the issue and we are working to resolve it.

@_date: 2018-01-10 18:41:05
We discovered another aspect of the engine that needed a little more testing. Keep an eye on the blog post as I am hearing that we are working on a new announcement. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:41:40
I can assure you that we are just having trouble locating your deposit. Due to in influx of new users and support tickets, there is typically a delay in response time and ticket resolution. We have been hiring excessively to keep up with the demand.

Upgrade has been delayed for a few hours, please check this link for updates.

He does say to avoid it for the meantime while we fix our trading engine, which is currently testing. We have not been censoring - we are removing old posts and re-organizing the subreddit so we can get to comments/complaints in a more organized fashion.
I'm sorry to hear that you've had a bad experience. Has your deposit been located yet?

Your funds could be stuck in an intermediary bank or they could be 'unclaimed' if it's missing a reference. Please provide all details of the transfer to the representative who is assisting you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:32:26
Hi there,
Your deposit is likely on hold due to a missing reference. Unfortunately our Customer Support team has been overwhelmed with support tickets due to our site performance. 
If your ticket has been escalated already then someone will be with you as soon as they're available.
Apologies for the inconvenience!
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:50:16
For our purposes we have to have the bank name match your Kraken account name. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:36:02
Apology accepted, thank you for choosing Kraken!

Hi there, Please see our CEO's latest post on the state of the platform here: 
We have been experiencing issues and are working to upgrade our trading engine.

Hi there, please see our CEO's statement about the platform:
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:52:42
Hi there, yes it is safe. Worst that could happen is your deposit is backlogged and takes a bit of time to clear (few hours), but as soon as 6 confirmations are met on the blockchain you'll see your funds on your Kraken account. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:08:02
Feel free to escalate your ticket here: 
Please note that we are experiencing some issues with our funding gateway at this time.

Have you opened a support ticket with us yet? Feel free to respond with a ticket # and I will be happy to look into this issue further.

Hi there, We don't have an ETA on BCH Deposits/withdrawals. Please check  for announcements regarding Kraken.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:43:00
We're aware of the issue and working to resolve funding. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:48:01
Hi there,
If your funds were not on Kraken at the time of the fork, you would not have been credited BCH. If your BTC was in a privately held wallet you may be able to recover the BCH by importing your address to a wallet that supports BCH. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:43:53
Hi there, 
We're taking a look into this right now!
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:38:22
No worries, it's totally understandable.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:19:50
Apologies for the inconvenience, Anna and Andrew have contacted our development team to adjust your limits. They're extremely busy at the moment but we really appreciate your patience!
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:24:30
At Kraken, unfortunately not. We must remain compliant with all local laws.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:10:12
Hi there, unfortunately the funding issue was caused by a bad gateway from one of our partners. We did not see the issue coming, or else we would've warned of downtime. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:28:49
This article is referring to this occurrence:
There have since been requests for retraction due to inaccuracy.
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:08:19
Anna is checking to see what she can do for you, this seems to be an outlier case. The failed withdrawals counted toward your limits, and we have to find a way to reset your limit. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:49:57
Feel free to open up a support ticket and I can escalate it for you.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:44:34
Here is some info about our fee schedule: 
Also, Gdax has lower fees than coinbase (same company) but they offer less trading pairs than Kraken. 
I will say that we are improving our trading engine at the moment, so some clients have experienced minor issues with the site. We are working to resolve the issues as soon as possible.
Thank you for your interest in Kraken!
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:41:27
We're currently upgrading our trading engine, and have had a few issues with crypto funding the past few days. Apologies for the inconvenience! Please keep an eye on our official twitter page  or go to our status page for updates.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:07:22
Well, for one Crypto markets are 24/7 so anytime we choose to undergo maintenance it's inconvenient for some users. Also, this particular issue was caused by a bad gateway from one of our partners. Once again, our development team is working hard to resolve it as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:41:41
It's more than likely an issue with our funding partner.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:21:11
Hi there, Margin allows you to borrow money from Kraken to make larger trades. More information can be found here: 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:07:34
It's been assigned to our payments team to further assist you. I've notified one of our developers of the issue and we are waiting to hear back from him. Thank you for your patience!
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:38:39
We're working on upgrading our trading engine at the moment. Apologies for the inconvenience! 
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:57:00
No problem, glad we could be of assistance!

It looks like your account has been verified. Happy trading!
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:39:42
Hi there, 
Our development team is currently working on an upgrade to our trading engine, it has been delayed due to the issues caused by the massive on-boarding of new clients. I can assure you that it is currently their top priority. Keep an eye out for newsletters for important dates.
Apologies for the inconveniences this has caused you.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:13:51
I can assure you that we are sticking around. I apologize for the inconveniences you've experienced. We're working on a trading engine update and are trying to implement it as soon as possible. This last crypto boom threw a wrench in our engine update process due to customer support requests. We've since hired a lot of customer service staff to free up our development team to focus on the trading engine.

We've recently upgraded our trading engine and are looking to add new digital assets in the coming months. We hope you'll give us a try!

Hi there, 
Apologies for the inconveniences you've experienced with us. I just wanted to drop by and comment that we have increased our customer support team to handle the influx of customer support tickets.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:15:40
Shamelessly plugging Zhao Chengpeng’s tweet on why withdrawal fees are high. 
Withdrawal fees need to cover:
1. Collecting from deposit address into cold wallet
2. If the deposit address does not have ETH, we need to send ETH to the address (another transaction fee)
3. Moving funds between different layers of cold/hot wallets
4. Research &amp; development of wallet integration
5. Infrastructure needed to run for 10M+ addresses and hundreds of tokens/smart contracts, with large number of deposits and withdrawals, in a secure manner
6. Ops team maintaining them
7. Security/finance teams for design, auditing, reconciliation, and even dealing with law enforcement agencies in assisting with fraud
8. Yes, and the last outgoing transaction
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:06:05
We've had a few issues in the past few months, however since we've removed decimal accuracy our trading engine issues have been (for the most part) resolved. Our support team has caught up to a massive backlog of requests and we've hired a lot of new staff to assist with the new support demands. 
We're always working to improve our platform, but we always keep security our number one priority.

As long as you have XBT reflected on your Kraken account at the time of the fork your Kraken account will be credited with the same amount of BCH
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:16:56
Depends on if you would like to have your funds ready to trade! Please see here for more information about August 1st: 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:33:23
Nope, in order for your Kraken account to receive BCC you will have to have your funds on your Kraken account at the time of the fork.
More info can be found here:
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:15:23
All Kraken clients holding Bitcoin (XBT) balances at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
All Kraken clients borrowing Bitcoin (XBT) for margin trades at the time of the fork will be debited an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
After the fork Kraken will enable BCH deposits and withdrawals (with replay protection enabled)
After the fork Kraken will enable BCH trading in the following pairs: BCH/XBT, BCH/USD, BCH/EUR
Kraken-owned Cryptowat.ch will support BCH charts and trading
BCH margin trading may be added at a later date if it survives and trade volume is robust
