Interesting. And very good points! Yep, it is the Paradox of Thrift I'm referring to, but I can see how that's not a issue long-term even if it is in a short-term. Like TheOneDM mentioned, people can only hoard for so long before they realized it makes sense to spend their bitcoins on something that provides utility.

Awesome comment rick2g! I agree, Amazon's "currency" is nothing like Bitcoin, but I definitely see the potential of Amazon accepting Bitcoin, even if eventually through a 3rd party that can ensure security. Also, I agree that if the price rises too fast it would attract vultures and hoarding and in order for a currency to be useful and it, well, needs to be used- unless of course it's perceived (eventually) like real gold due to its fixed supply. Then as more people use and more businesses accept Bitcoin, the USD exchange rate could go in the several thousands of dollars per Bitcoin by the 2020's! Once you start seeing news stories about the first multi-millionaires made by Bitcoin, things will really get interesting!

I think you touched on something at the end there and what I tell people. I compare Bitcoin to the internet itself. A decentralized network on wich to trade goods and services. Bitcoin will have an impact on currency equal to or greater than the impact the Internet has had on commerce. The web was adopted and embraced by the masses between 1995 and 2000, but it was being used for a decade prior by early adopters, geeks, and rich people. I  think Bitcoin today is at about where the Internet was in 1993… the next 7 years were nothing short of amazing (and quite disruptive)! Given the speed at witch digital technologies progress now, it won't be 7 years for Bitcoin, it will be a couple years or perhaps only 7 months before this is a common means of exchange.

Bitcoin it's mentioned in the comments section of this article and it's very relevant to the subject bitcoins overall

If you can hold on to your bitcoins long enough to see a critical mass of widespread usage and enough large merchants accepting online and offline, then you never have to "cash out" to buy things with traditional fiat currency.

Many people dismissed the concept of personal computers in the 70's and the Internet circa 1990 so it doesn't surprise me that many would have similar reactions to Bitcoins. Some people have vision, others don't. I've only been talking to people about Bitcoin for 6 months, but having the same responses from friends, family, and co-workers. You're right, their loss!

Seriously! This is exactly what I've been telling my friends and family!

Seriously one of best articles I've read since first learning and studying bitcoins since Sep. 2012

It's funny to see people treat Bitcoin like a stock or commodity when it's really FAR more than that. But if you insist on speculating value, look at Trace Mayer's chart on possible bitcoin prices based on "market cap" or bitcoin value in circulation. 
At $91 per Bitcoin and about 11 million coins in circulation, we have $1 Billion worth now in circulation. Soon we'll have about 12 million coins in circulation and a $667 price which makes Bitcoin ONLY the size as Western Union!
Someday at 15 million coins and a $1,750 price, Bitcoin surpasses PayPal!

I would relate Bitcoin to Linux and Wikipedia, and open source and crowd sourced project that once they achieve critical mass there's not much desire for alternative/competing projects that achieve the same goal.
