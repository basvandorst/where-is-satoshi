A variety of blades would be nice. Always good to try out some new brand.

They won't send seeds to some countries,  
[Amsterdam Seed Center]( however does.  
They also accept bitcoin.

Enough memes already.

I thought "bitcoin users not affected" was implied heavily enough...
Imho privacy is the most valuable feature of the bitcoin protocol.

Your inappropriate tone is a good indicator.

I know it's not anonymous, that's why I used the term privacy.

Quite a well rounded article.
I'm surprised because "Die Welt" is actually a really conservative newspaper.

I had to try several times, but eventually i got my orders through at bitstamp. (about one hour ago)
By now it seems quite normal.

Are you by any chance from a country that police might consider "high-profile"?
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:45:37
Just checked it, works fine for me.

Thanks for reminding me why I had you tagged as a troll.

Please make sure to tell Herr Rösler that bitcoin would make it even easier for his corrupt party to accept shady donations from corporations.
On a more serious note: Give him a good kick from me.

I actually think the right one is a bit overdone, too flashy. Left one looks a bit more serious.

Anything Europeans in particular should know? Can I deposit Euros?

It all depends on how you obtain your bitcoin. 
If you do a face-to-face transaction then the pseudonymity (not anonymity!) of the protocol will give you a high degree of privacy so long as you don't link your bitcoin adress to any personal informations.
