You are aware that the entire design of a blockchain relies on decentralized consensus of the ledger? So because thousands of programmers more capable than you or I agree that my address contains 'X' amount of BTC, we can agree that the value is stored in consensus, no matter what you think it's worth in dollars or euros may be, the value is still stored.

This guy bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:02:28
I've learned a few new ones so successful post I guess!
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:50:51
I feel like it just creates anxiety amongst the new investors-
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:20:19
How so? By what? By whom? I want answers, Mr. Troll because your comment is wayyyyy off topic, brah!
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:04:21
Moron redditor for 2 days? This post- that you are replying to specifically says that I have been using Reddit as a tool since BTC was $100- 
You know what they say about idiots?
You never argue with them because they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience...

Great point- I guess I'm concerned about the lowest common denominators being the new investor's food, like empty carbs, whereas old investors have been eating complex carbs, and will last in the race longer... which do we want/need more of?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:51:16
First world problems, right?!
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:29:54
That's a great point- I do follow a couple of them via Facebook follows and whatnot- blogs have long been a "crystal ball" tool for my investing. r/Bitcoin was at one point and still is- I simply prefer the focus to be on innovation not necessarily price. Let's face it any adopter is checking the price fairly habitually on his/her own!
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:09:01
Very valid point- I don't know the answer. I think a more educated user base is a good thing, might not matter though, you're right.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:50:56
I'm unfamiliar with topic flairs forgive my ignorance 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:13:43
Like rotten tomatoes for the source of information?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:58:19
That's it- originally, pre-investment I tried in every way to prove to myself that BTC was flawed... I would dig through this sub Reddit to find a BTC doubter with some clout.... it never happened. Some made good points of problems and all were addressed by the community or developers. That gave me confidence to invest... had it been all rollercpasyer memes on this page I never would have had the knowledge to stay true to my initial investment 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:17:49
I remember those 300 memes more when the price was 300 (hah not to say they weren't there prior) The memes don't bother me as much as the constant Bitcoin rollercoaster guy gif- 
Up down up down, yea we get! Price volatility in a brand new global asset class. I enjoy how lighthearted the Bitcoin community can be, and also enjoy some real meat and potatoes financial perspective.

This was my original watering hole... sure it's a bit more crowded now, but I love other animals and welcome their company- sometimes they stink though 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:53:30
It was bound to become mainstream- does it do so like fidget spinners or cell phones
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:01:32
100 BTC is worth 100 BTC - that's the point
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:37:58
Ok, sorry- I take back my Troll name call as you seem to be concerned for people's investments and I commend that- however you still threw that first grenade that didn't add anything to the conversation in my opinion so I will choose to most likely agree to disagree with your opinions! All good homie
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:55:43
Great English! Informatics!! I like that ! That describes me basically. I was drawn into investing by the verifiable information I could find on this early sub- pages of garble hyping the price or profit potential might give people the scam/ponzi vibe
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:12:45
I've noticed this. It's also hard to descern sincerity from alterior motives- some in the BTC subs are bringing up legitimate technological concerns, with others are  attempting to muddy the water to affect the price short term, or promote an alt. So I guess the main uses the core community can promote currently are bitcoin durability, ease of use, predictable supply, borderless reach, &amp;c
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:40:02
Ok? More like 2 hr account- only created to make this post, so what's illegitimate about that, exactly? Freakin Reddit!
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:58:55
Nice. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:18:31
That's just the thing- there are users like myself that don't need the utility more than the store of wealth aspect.... utility will grow if the store of wealth properties remain- and they should considering the floodgates of money and brainpower pushing now driving the ecosystem 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:12:06
To me this sub was THE depot for a quick heads up on the tech advancements... it still could be without the distracting price posts all day everyday
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:59:52
I use twitter solely to troll Seth MacFarlane- true story 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:41:28
It's not about what it's worth compared to traditional currencies... I know that I have 'X' BTC out of a possible 21million - consensus and market prInciple of supply and demand can figure out how much that's "worth".
You have 'X' USD out of a possible 100 trillion, or is is now 100 gigazillion, or 100 bazingadillion....
See my point, dude or dudette?

Sweet, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:21:08
^^For real
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:34:06
Is it too late though? It's been useful to me as an adopter- I just wish it could get back there for the noobies
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:12:19
Not completely- it's one idea chamber out of many. I don't listen to music based on what's tops of r/music , I can still use that to figure out who the next players will be, if I care to
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:15:22
Is this sub mainstream? Honest question- I would love for it to be
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:07:40
Wow thanks! I will never for get my first BTC tip! You rock!
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:16:03
I can't argue with that logic!
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:36:51
I really like that 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:52:25
It’s a 100 billion market- how would 1 billion added to that cause a 80% drop 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:07:08
Well it's happened before... that's not a catalyst but certainly after the crash back down into the Hundos from the Thousos cut people's expectations back down to size and most investors had to remind themselves why they are hodling to begin with- damn I love how my autocorrect doesn't even fuck with Hodl anymore
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:29:06
You can feel it
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:18:42
Seems to be a trend, thanks for the tip!
