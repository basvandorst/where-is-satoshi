So when is the best time to buy the token ? Right at the start or do I wait until the end ?
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:44:22
* **2 weeks until the launch of the sale! March 31st**
* Tons of great PR and marketing around Factom
* Tokens will be publicly tradeable ( unlike Ether )
* Koinify will host it
* Very high standard of accountability and transparency
* Koinify will host it using Factom's system to record the sales.

20 miles on a unicycle... that's like 40 miles on a bicycle, no ? Or 10 ? I suck at math. But it sounds like a serious challenge, to which I say : bravo.

Awesome. Joshua's a really cool guy and Vaultoro and Factom seem like a great fit. Check out this podcast

Man, that looks so tiresome. I'm impressed Paul can even get on that thing, I'd surely fall off and break my nose !
