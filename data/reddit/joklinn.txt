At 100 million per coin btc market cap would be 170 trillion$. I think all the money in the world is alot less than that, 40-70 trillion$ r smthn.

ok but lets say your a miner, and your maybe renting a place and you have some ASIC miners pummelling the electricity, your probably calculating your profits per month, and if it suddenly isnt sustainable more youd have to shut down

just wondering if for any reason it would drop this much if it could ever get back up if the miners are gone

Why would they put this on youtube, seems to me like they just want you to download their software so it can hack your wallet r smthn

so in the event it drops to 2k, its likely dead for good?
what about the 1000$ to 300$ drop then? why did that not kill it?

Correct me if im wrong but arent they just getting the bch low, waiting for it to rise and btc to dip and then changing it back to btc, basically doubling their btc investment when btc then rises again

Whats your plan? are you hoping it drops to 5k tomorrow so u can buy and then sell again at 7k? taking 40% profit. Or do you plan on hodling for years? in which case, I would recommend just buy right now, and always buy more each time it dips.
Get some bitcoin just to atleast be in it &gt; Buy the dips &gt; hodl &gt; profit
