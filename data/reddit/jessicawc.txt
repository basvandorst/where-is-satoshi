Trading is commission free, that means there is no fee taken when you execute (open or close) a trade. 
There is a daily financing rate that applies if you use leverage. Rates can be found on our [Markets]( page.
There are otherwise no other fees.

Hi AnonymousRev. We're a market maker for some trades and a broker (router to exchanges/liquidity providers) for others.
You can find more details about our business model here:

It depends on the market. Usually for stocks we match trades internally as market makers. For cryptocurrencies or Forex, we may hedge part of the trades on the external markets.
We are NOT a bucket shop. Bucket shops will "bucket" your trade and stop it out automatically, usually at a 1% loss driven by price manipulation. On Whaleclub, there is no concept of stop outs or market feed manipulation since we use market feeds that are publicly available and independently verifiable at all times.
Whaleclub is a hybrid market maker / ECN platform. This model is not new as many large brokers and financial institutions such as Alpari and Pepperstone have been using it for decades. What is new is that Whaleclub is powered entirely by bitcoin! :)
