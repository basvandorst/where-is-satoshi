lol awesome - that's why crypto works!
if you prefer PGP signed messages, try our service coinmixer.se! (but please do check them properly...)

You are right, that you can guess if some output address belongs to the mixer with certain (low) probability if you have an information about mixer transactions (you would have to use it, rewrite the captcha and pay the fee every few hours).
Anyway, why would you use the service (coinbase) if it was monitoring and censoring your transactions?

I agree. We will add the note about Electrum knowing all the addresses from the wallet into our manual to make it more obvious.

Yes, the mixed bitcoins will be linked to other user/users. This usually isn't a problem. Mixing bitcoins is not illegal in most countries (according to my knowledge) and the fact that your bitcoins comes from a mixer doesn't mean that you can be hold responsible for their origin.

I agree with you that the mixers require higher level of trust, but I also think that there is no such thing as completely decentralized or trustless software.
Let's think about small projects like (JoinMarket, Electrum, Tumblebit, etc.). There is usually only one source of the software (project website, github, etc.). It is possible to put a trojan horse into the source code/binary that will send all the bitcoins to the author of the trojan horse or spy on him. The author of the trojan horse may be the author of the code himself, a government or and hacker that got access to the servers.
The attack is more complicated, but it is still possible. We would need something like decentralized software distribution and decentralized collaboration to solve this problem completely.

don't forget to anonymize your coins afterwards!

It is not so easy to detect that you sent the bitcoins to the mixer. There is a new (unique) address created for every mixing operation.

Don't get me wrong, I think that JoinMarket is a good project. I'm just saying that nothing is perfect and the project government is also important. In the ideal case, every stable release should be signed by multiple trusted developers. This decreases the probability of an trojan attack.
In reality, almost nobody checks the source code before running a new version :(

You have basically the following options for Desktop:
- Full bitcoin node (e.g., Bitcoin Core). It is the most secure type of wallet. However, this type of wallet requires over 80 GB of hard drive space, generates a lot of network traffic and may be too complicated for new bitcoin users.
- Simplified Payment Verification client (e.g., Electrum). It is also very secure and requires very low amount of space on your hard drive. I would recommend this type for most users.
- Web wallet with private keys stored on client side (e.g., Coin.Space). This type of wallet can support many platforms, but is prone to selective attacks (JavaScript of the website modified only for some users).
There are also mobile and hardware wallets, which are usually also SPV clients and are more resistant to malware.
Most wallets allows you to set a custom fee (but is better to keep the default value in order to avoid confirmation delays). Fore more info see:
