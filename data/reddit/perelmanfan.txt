Understanding that other people don't like to think too much is profitable.

Weird to me that more older people don’t get it. If they’ve kept their eyes open, they’ve got more data than younger people re: the horror of inflatable, confiscatable, friction-laden state scrip. Some old guys do get...but it enough.

I am 62 years old. I am far more excited about Bitcoin than anyone, young or old, in my immediate circle of friends and family. It may be because I've been a science journalist my whole life, so the value of networks - and network effects - made immediate sense to me. The bottom line is I've found the light goes on with people if you make it clear that Bitcoin is not backed by "nothing" but rather a growing, valuable network of users and miners. Most people understand that Facebook's value is based on a growing user network. Ultimately, so is Bitcoin's.

Yes, I understand your point and appreciate it. The public at large has a role in providing what the Darwinians would call "fitness functions." For Bitcoin, these would be opinions regarding the relative importance of, say, transaction volume capacity vs. maintaining the low cost/decentralization potential of confirming nodes. But once that's determined, code optimization to achieve those ends should be left to software architects.

Szabo is almost certainly Bitcoin's originator. His vote on this complex and multifaceted question matters a great deal. Mine does not. I also don't advise brain surgeons on appropriate procedures. Expertise matters.

To return to the bridge analogy, the public gets to decide if It's primary obligation is to be cheap, pretty, or withstand once-per-century floods. But experts then get to determine how best to meet the agreed-upon requirements.

I don't know Szabo's opinion. Bitcoin community should ask him for it and give great weight to his response and the reasons he gives for it. When bridge architects build a suspension bridge over a chasm, most people respect their training and don't contribute back-of-the-envelope revisions. Why is bitcoin different?

My opinion about 2X vs. noX is: whatever Nick Szabo recommends.
