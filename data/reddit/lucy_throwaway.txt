The speed with which they downvoted this post is further proof that they stalk me everywhere.

Clarify this for me, many "bitcoin 101" infographics, brochures and videos still present the message that an average person can get bitcoin from mining. 
These days mining is not a good way for newcomers to get bitcoin. I haven't checked lately but I can't imagine that an ASIC expected to break even before obsoleteness can be had for less than $1000 today. And a newcomer is likely to jump in head first and buy a machine that will **never** turn a profit, (IE usb asics).
Why haven't we updated information to reflect the fact that the average person shouldn't consider mining? Or am I missing something?

I made a sub devoted to poking fun at their hypocrisy and general circle jerk.
The only catch is that they downvote brigade it so hard you need to change your settings to see all but 4 of the 100 plus posts.  So welcoming and accepting.

When MTGOX failed it was analogous to a bank failing. It just happened to be the largest and most trusted "bank" in an environment with few "banks". There was no issue with the coins this "bank" was holding.
A large percentage of people with bitcoin were effected, and it stood to reason that trust in bitcoin had been shaken. Further there were certainly many people who, after losing their bitcoins, who did not buy more and stopped using bitcoin entirely. As such the price drop was entirely predictable. 
The 51% attack issue has become a serious concern many many times in the past. Every time miners have moved to different pools and averted the issue. There is little to no incentive for miners to allow a 51% attack to occur. As such, this issue has only a minor impact on the price.

Very very very very low. Statistically, the electricity cost would be better spent on a scratch card or the lottery. 
Rather than solo mining to help the network joining a very small p2p pool would be your best bet for both payout and helping the network.

Im not going to accept your tip out of respect. You deserve to keep it for doing your part to protect the network.

Pure speculation on my part but here it goes;
BTC was undervalued because of fears over the auction results for the last week or so. Now that is out of the way were seeing a return to normal levels of confidence in BTC.

You already hit on the issue. ACH takes too long. Credit cards are too risky.
Its slightly ironic, because an irreversible, nearly instant payment method would solve this problem eloquently. In other words bitcoin would be the perfect way to buy bitcoin. 
The only real option to buy them instantly for a low fee would be to do a local bitcoin style buy with an IRL friend who already has bitcoin, who is selling at cost as a favor. Or selling something for bitcoin, provided you could sell it in less time than it takes to verify an account.
I personally think that considering the advances that need to be made before the "internet explorer joe" demographic can store bitcoin on a personal wallet with little fear of having them stolen, the long wait times protect some individuals from making mistakes because they can't make big mistakes impulsively.

A domestic crypto does not provide much more stability than the failing currency. In this situation a resident would want a store of value that had nothing to do with their nations failing economy.
Bitcoin offers them a fair deal in international and internal transactions. The forces determining the value of their currency are now distributed across the globe, not concentrated in some house of parliament or palace. Even the china news roller coaster is better than knowing for a fact that the government can decimate the actual value of your life savings whenever they feel like it.
As far as price and altruism goes, if BTC becomes the best way to transfer value among a minor but important industry or region the price won't matter. If you have the BTC to single handedly bail out a small nations economy you see the philanthropic value of the technology. 
Further this donor would likely be a very very early adopter. There are many people out there who have found themselves rich beyond belief with very little idea of how to cash it all out. These ultra wealthy early adopters have every reason to donate pseudo-anonymously to a nation changing cause. They can do something truly beneficial for the world on a multimillion dollar scale and don't need to make their bitcoin fortunes known to the press, tax man or criminals in doing so.

Keep using bitcoin. Keep developing new bitcoin services. Don't buy into FUD. Help translate existing software into new languages. Worry about technological issues not prices. 
Then we wait for a small country with widespread internet access and smartphone use to have a currency crisis. Get someone on the ground to set up a charity that in essence offers the education, support and tools needed to partially replace the failing currency and banking system with bitcoin for some purposes. 
 
Find an altruistic bitcoin 1%er to donate a large number of coins towards subsidizing the costs of buying bitcoins with a worthless/volatile fiat currency and possibly allowing the charity to reimburse network fees to make micro-payments more feasible in an economy where every Satoshi counts. 
Once a stable government begins to reemerge use some of that money to lobby the living hell out of them and make sure bitcoin is a fixture in the economy.

Bitcoin and anything of the top 5 by volume EXCEPT dogecoin.

If you can buy bitcoin, your time is much better spent buying it. 
At current prices you will be making far far far less than $1 an hour from faucets and surveys. 
However if you can do graphic design, programing, translation, or pretty much anything where many people work remotely as freelancers getting paid in bitcoin is a viable option. 
But if you just have a normal job, even at federal minimum wage, you are better off working an extra few hours a week and buying $10-20 worth of bitcoin from an exchange every paycheck.

Take this dogecoin level drivel elsewhere.

Crypto currencies are a [paradigm shift]( in the world of currency, cryptography applications, and distributed networks. 
As such many people are resistant, skeptical, or downright scared of change when presented with this new technology. Others are interested and receptive.
My cousin is a stock broker, and my stock broker. When I moved most of the cash sitting in my portfolio to bitcoin he was a skeptic and sent me a few articles that were not exactly anti-bitcoin but were very reserved about its benefits. And I don't blame him. His education and experience has taught him that investing in currency is a bad idea, and that forex trading is risky at best. So his resistance is understandable.
