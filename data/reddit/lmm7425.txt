I was thinking of buying the [ODROID XU4]( with a [CloudShield]( for an all-in-one node. Get a small external HDD and save the blockchain to that. Not sure if anyone else has done that yet or can confirm it works...

Awesome! Thanks!

I knew it had changed but didn't know how. Thanks for finding this!

+1 for this. Did it a few days ago for the first time and it couldn't have been easier.

If I purchased one that was empty, I could load it and unload it as needed, right? I'm thinking of using it as a cold-storage wallet in a safe.

Nice! Now *that* is is lightweight!

Never used it before but I'll look into it, thanks!

Thanks! I've seen that in a few projects and wondered how it worked.

Nice! Looking forward to it!

Thanks! I've done a couple other bash scripts, but this is my first true programming language.

I haven't tested it on a Pi yet, but with Python3 installed it should be OK. May need the text adjusted depending on your display settings...

Thanks for the tip! I was trying to figure out which exchange to use from [this]( list, as they're all different. Chain.so also offers a price [here]( but I'm not sure what exchange that's from...

I was thinking something like [this]( and just leaving the terminal up 24/7 as a "dashboard" of sorts. The Raspberry Pi team recently [launched]( an official display as well.  
There's a couple similar projects [here]( and [here](

I considered a few python tools/wrappers, but wanted to keep the dependencies to a minimum. But maybe I can make another version!

See this...

Awesome, thanks!
