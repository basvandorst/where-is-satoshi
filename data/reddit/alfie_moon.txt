Bacon and bitcoin... amazing!

I've been with CoinCorner a little while now. Never had any problems. I like the site, I like the app. Customer support team are helpful. Only downside I guess is the 5% credit card fee, but it doesn't really bother me. I'd recommend them.

So... nothing new then?
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:37:47
I'm confused... aren't there already hundreds of charities that accept bitcoin donations?

Putting the fun back into buying socks!

Netflix accepted bitcoin?!
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:35:08
Thanks @_date: 2015-05-21 09:07:39
I'm just optimistic :)

Hahaa! A day too early, but if there was ever another reason to have pizza two nights in a row, this is it! 
@_date: 2015-05-22 09:33:08
I'm having mine for dinner!

BITCOIN COMMUNITY UNITE!
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:51:04
Where in the world are you? It's 10:50am on Thursday 21st May here in the UK. If it's Bitcoin Pizza Day where you are already, I'm jealous!

I've never heard of thunderclap. How can it help?

Great name, beautiful cat! Odd question, but does your cat have more than the normal amount of toes (or is it just the way the photo has been taken)?

I remember struggling a while back with a Google search for Circle.com... probably my bad, as I did only type "Circle" into the search bar, but I never had this problem when searching for any other "Bit-" or "Coin-" companies.
I see they have mastered this now and do appear at the top of the page when you search "Circle" - but the point I'm trying to make is that having a name that goes against the crowd is not always a good idea for a) the businesses (e.g. Circle and trying to found among all the geometric shapes on the internet) or b) the customers (especially newbies who find it confusing already and need these businesses to be self-explanatory).

I just don't get why this is such big news? Sorry Coinbase, but this isn't exactly revolutionary, there are a number of exchanges that already offer the ability to buy BTC with credit/debit cards.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:08:48
I've used CoinCorner for a while now because they accept credit cards.
@_date: 2015-08-21 10:09:57
It seems a bit desperate to me too. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 10:10:03
Thanks for the reply! Is it capped (monthly?) at all? Or could you buy £100/day every day (an example, ha).
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:35:02
Awesome! How do they accept bitcoin? Do they have a personal wallet or do they have a POS system?
@_date: 2015-07-21 13:13:46
I think [CoinCorner]( accept customers from the UAE... they are a UK exchange. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:04:47
I've bought BTC with credit card from coincorner before - worked fine. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:28:41
If you are looking to buy BTC in the UK with credit/debit card, try CoinCorner - I have been using them for ages now.
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:28:59
Yes, try [CoinCorner](
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:40:36
Instant purchases are great! 
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:50:33
I've not heard of them before - are they new?
@_date: 2016-09-21 10:02:17
Your guess is as good as mine!
@_date: 2015-09-15 08:11:50
It looks very scammy to me too. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 08:26:52
I used them once, but stopped using them after I read this in their FAQs:


Sounded a bit dodgy to me, so I've not used them since. I use CoinCorner now because they accept credit cards.
@_date: 2015-09-02 12:09:39
Suspect or not suspect, I will certainly not be using them after this stress test stunt they are planning to pull.
@_date: 2015-09-16 11:41:45
Awesome! I've been waiting for them to add Euro for ages!
@_date: 2015-11-12 13:40:18
Just took a look at your pitch - looks good! All the best guys!
@_date: 2016-05-11 10:11:41
