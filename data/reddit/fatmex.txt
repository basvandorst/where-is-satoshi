don't invest what your not willing to lose, or only pay what it is worth to you?

anecdotal examples given but you figure this must be an untracked loss of bitcoins. i'm not aware of any mechanism for replacing of bitcoins lost due to lack of backups and hardware loss.
edit: in many ways it is closer to gold than the USD. limited supply, value determined by supply and demand and no central bank influences, no tracking. where it excels ahead of both, and sticks a foot in the currency side, is the ease of transferring and at precise amounts.

and mining rate will slow as we approach that over the next couple of decades(also subtract from the cap over time when a wallet is lost to a bad hard drive or disposing of a computer with 50 btc when they were less than a dollar). that's the supply side. if the rate of demand slows at the same pace of this supply then btc will be stable. thats not really the case as more people get involved and those involved tend to become more invested in BTC and as the price goes up everyone tends to want to hold onto their BTC. I don't see BTC being a currency which will replace any steadily inflating currency but instead a place to secure savings especially in the event of uncertainty in the economies of fiat currencies albeit btc is not so stable growth savings.

your example i would expand to include investment and consumerism, so cars to get to work or a t.v. that will lose value but provides utility.
