This is ladies.

It means you can take advantage of that information. 
If you know how something is being manipulated, that's your inside info pot of gold.

"Hooby" took MUCH more of your profit than what you signed up for. They're lying, and you have been fleeced. How come OKCoin took only 5% of the profits in the same time period?
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:52:43
I have tons of experience.
Oh, another thing they can do is fuck with your fills. If that happens, you don't stick around. But that falls into the stealing outright category.

It has stopped, because the fix is in. Via the derivatives market. The dam will break when the defaults start happening. Just as with silver, it's better to be early than one day too late.

Real futures exchanges can take much more than your original investment. They can break you in half.
I'm not defending Huobi, because they are lying and cheating. OKCoin took only 5% of the profit from the same settlement period.

They run stop losses, so you don't use them. You use only limit orders to avoid slippage. They implement margin cascade runs, so you make sure you have enough funds to avoid getting stopped out, you monitor that closely. When they try to stop you out, you buy more.
You COUNTER-ATTACK.
Stealing your money outright is the only thing they can really do to hurt you. So you only use up-to-the-minute reputable exchanges, and study all the available feedback. At the first sign of trouble, like Huobi taking 46% of your profit, RUN don't walk.

 Funny. Seriously, you made me laugh :))
Twice is "constantly banned"? You have a knack for hyperbole. You may be right though, because it looks as though I'm on my way again for calling out huobi and "shilling" for okcoin. I would be such an awesome contributor if i could just tow the line and stfu. To hell with the truth.
I had good karma score with Shyanne5, in just a few days, but took a huge 60 pt hit, i think it was, for daring to criticize coinbase (see my recent submission about that). I had submitted a post, was heartily attacked, and kept responding to my tormentors. I knew that would happen, but don't give a fuck about karma (except real karma).
The other time I was banned, about the bitcoin system, what can I say. People are generally very very stupid when it comes to trading bitcoin, and don't know a good thing when it slaps them in the face.
"It's the martindale system!" Um, no.
"That's DCA!" Um, no.
"Buying low and selling high is a terrible way to trade bitcoin! Warren Buffet does it, but that's only good for blue chips!"
Um, k thx bye.

Not a shill. I was cinnamon7, but I forgot my password, and don't want to give my email to recover it. Before that, I was Shyanne5, but was banned from posting, because I started some anti-coinbase threads. Lol. My posts don't even appear anymore. And even before that, I was banned for talking about my winning bitcoin system, even though I was dishing out free buy and sell signals.
I just really like everything about OKCoin. I will not hesitate to call them out if necessary.
Oh, I am pissed that I had to give them driver's license number and street address, even though it's only bitcoin in and bitcoin out.
