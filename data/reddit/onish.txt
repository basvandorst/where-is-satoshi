While all of this is great news for BitCoin, I am not sure if it can account for all of the sudden spikes in BitCoin's worth.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:13:17
You can try contacting their customer support to find out what is going on. I wouldn't worry about it until it passes the date that they said you should get your coins by.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:17:37
They need to stop flirting and make a move!
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:09:52
I wish I had a friend like you a few months ago. Granted, I am pretty far out of my teenage years, but It would have been nice to have someone there to urge me to get involved earlier.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:16:21
Yes, 100 times yes. Set them up a wallet with a few pieces of a Bitcoin in each. I guarantee it will spike their interest and probably lead to their involvement in Bitcoin. If they don't use it, or show little interest in it, you can always reclaim the coins later.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:21:35
There are always other places to buy from if you dislike the terms coinbase is offering. Check out MtGox or localbitcoins.
It sucks that coinbase isn't able to keep up with the demand at the moment, but they are doing us a favor and at least being honest about the situation.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:11:14
I'm glad to be part of a community that does things like this, made up of those who are willing to give, and those who do the right thing.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:41:13
Proof please, because I seriously doubt that you personally know the majority of those day trading speculators.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:37:35
Depends on your definition of "rich". To some, 10,000 dollars is their definition of rich, while to others, it is their definition of poor. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:00:21
Let me get this straight, they bought an electric car with currency generated on the internet? What a high-tech day and age we live in.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:47:03
Don't let the price of a BTC scare you away. You can get a mbtc for as low as 1 dollar! It is never too late to get in the game.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:06:33
You're better off focusing on an alt-coin. Bitcoin mining is pretty much over for the average person.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:25:27
Just read about it....sucks. Time to change passwords.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:33:02
It is always great to hear of a new business adopting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:52:55
While I do not think it is a manual process, I do think that they need to verify that they are indeed going to recieve money for the coins they send you. This takes time and I believe the reason for their slow response time is due to the fact that a lot of their employees have probably taken Thanksgiving and the day after off.
It sucks, but it is just something we have to deal with. I wouldn't really say coinbase is sketchy. They have a pretty good reputation in the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:11:27
That's all I was hoping for.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:35:48
Can Kevin get me a sweet deal?
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:12:51
Wow, that kid must be speechless right now. I know I would be if that happened to me.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:25:49
Now is the next best time to get involved. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:18:08
If only Santa could send me some Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:19:53
Why does coinbase take 5 days to process my sale, and then stop me from buying any new coins until that first sale is finalized?
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:13:30
Haha, thank you. I'll take a look.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:52:30
10/10 would not steal.

"Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy."
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:13:17
Can't tell if this post is actually an ingenious way to beg for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:46:31
It seems like Bitcoin Black Friday was a success!
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:38:54
I am going to have to agree, why would you need to push people to donate to you if your goal was to just get people interested in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:48:15
It is a good idea, if you have the money to do that. I'm sure they would appreciate it. I've been thinking about doing the same thing, but I don't have enough money to give each one of them .1.
Either way, I'm sure you will spark their interests by doing that!
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:28:13
Holy cow! Thank you very much! I've seen people get tipped before, just never thought it would happen to me. That is why it seemed like a foreign concept to me. With that being said, I really do appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:42:46
Stories like this one are popping up everywhere. Once people realize how easy Bitcoin makes purchasing certain items, it will take off even more so than it already is.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:41:14
My favorite of the 4 coins you drew is the bottom right. 10/10 would buy btc.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:26:36
You had me excited for a second, that BitcoinMining was reddit's subreddit of the day, which would have been great for spreading information about Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:13:56
It will even itself out. Probably the news from China that got people excited.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:19:50
You would think they would take the time to find someone who speaks English to write these messages. I feel like they would fool a lot more people if they did.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:25:32
I don't have much, but to me, it is a private matter and I usually keep it to myself. For those who do have a lot, it is probably better to keep it to yourself, otherwise everyone may want a piece of what you have.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:11:49
Didn't we already reach it last week before the fall?
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:53:54
I am interested to see what the future holds.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:08:16
They must realize how much they're missing out on by not accepting Bitcoins. I don't understand why, after all this time, they still ignore it.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:04:39
Thanks Reddit! Now we just have to become the subreddit of the day too.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:39:44
I couldn't even imagine what spin987 was thinking. I can't even fathom getting 10 dollars in a tip, let alone falling into an extra 2000. Maybe lolnice1 was spreading a little holiday cheer early?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:01:49
I would stick with BTC. Those alt coins generally have no benefit over BTC and are fueled by those looking to make a quick buck. Earlier today, someone posted a twitter account that had 40,000 followers, and the whole account's purpose was to pump up alt coins so that the could sell them at high prices.
Personally, I would just keep investing whatever money you can afford to lose into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:15:37
I suspect we should see an increase come next week. Bitcoin is sure to be a hot topic around the dinner table this Thanksgiving.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:44:49
I can't answer that one for you, I've stayed away from using MtGox since I deal with USD. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:13:03
Thank you for this, I wish more people would look at Bitcoin's history before panicking.

Can I still pretend I have a time machine?
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:25:33
I am not sure if you would want to list all of that personal information. I feel like someone might take advantage of it if enough money is on the line.
Honestly though, I don't know how you might go about assuring those participating that you will not run off with the money. I don't really have much experience in that department. It is a very crucial detail you will have to figure out though, before creating something like a lottery. I really wish I knew more so I could help you out. Sorry man.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:46:40
Just jump in, now is the best time to get in. You can't change the past.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:50:22
Trading in USD? Use coinbase.com. To answer your question about the price, no one is sure. I wouldn't invest more than you're willing to lose. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:36:30
Those who sold have little faith in what Bitcoin is all about. I believe in it and will always hold in times of panic.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:20:59
Very true.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:16:55
Sure, you can keep me updated. I've had nothing but a pleasurable experience working with coinbase, even though they take a while to process orders and deliver coins.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:30:45
The best way to prove them wrong is to get rich.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:33:19
You could look into external apps, or offline storage, however I would probably just keep it on coinbase. I have talked with people who trust coinbase to hold onto more than just 1 btc for them, and everything has been fine. 
I would be weary of external apps, as I have read many stories of coins being stolen or lost due to the app.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:48:24
If big businesses start accepting Bitcoin, then its' current price would match its' worth.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:23:52
While others may be focusing on the possible loss of your 100 dollars, I would like to say good job for getting someone new involved in Bitcoin. It is our job to spread the word and help those who are just starting out!
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:34:54
I'm going to go ahead and assume this is a scam.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:31:39
Welcome to the community!
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:09:22
Yeah, any of the other bit pin subreddits would be great too.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:57:36
It is refreshing to see, especially when you're so used to how strangers usually ignore one another in the real world.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:40:40
It sounds like you have a level head on your shoulders and you're getting involved with Bitcoin for the right reasons. Good luck to you and welcome aboard!
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:47:16
If you reside in the USA, I would suggest coinbase.com. I have known many people who have had no issues with purchasing BitCoin from coinbase with a debit card. 
The only thing you have to understand is that since you are using a debit card, it will take 4 or so business days to process your order.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:03:33
I've had good experiences with Tigerdirect.com in the past. If they start to accept Bitcoin, I'm sure they'll have my business again.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:25:13
Most likely they will lose some money in the short term, but I have faith that the price will rebound because there will be tons of people looking to buy all those newly dumped coins. So, as long as you are willing and able to lose all the money you put into bitcoins, those hoarders should be ok in the long run.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:39:05
While it may be a good idea to save, you must remember that we have to also spend them. Spending Bitcoins for goods makes them more valuable in the long run than if everyone hoarded the ones they have.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:06:00
Good to hear.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:56:27
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:31:32
Personally, I would create a coinbase account and send some of the btc you have on your stick over to that account to sell every so often. If you live in the U.S., that is probably the best option to get money for your coins securely.
As to keeping the rest of your btc safe, you should be alright with keeping it on the stick for now. Just make sure you and only you know the password for it, and don't click or go to any sketch sites.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:26:46
It will definitely be an important market, and will probably only help further Bitcoin's growth in the future.

Bitcoin is rising fast. We may see 2k in the next few days.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:20:51
I would suggest selling your coins for what you absolutely need to get by, and maybe a little extra in case of an emergency. Other than that, I would personally keep the rest in the form of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:15:19
Mining for Bitcoin no longer makes a profit unless you have the best of the best equipment to do so right at this moment. If I were you, I would just buy Bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:42:11
The disparity is caused by how easy it is to buy and sell bitcoins and transform them into USD or other forms of money.
If you used USD, I probably would have bought from coinbase from the start since it is generally considered the safe way for those in the USA to purchase and sell bitcoins. MtGox is much easier to get other forms of money out of other than USD, and since a lot of those investing in bitcoin are from overseas, it is generally the exchange they use. This is why MtGox is so expensive. Those overseas wouldn't want to use coinbase because it deals in USD, thus their Bitcoin price is lower.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:32:00
Look at what happened when China took notice of Bitcoin. The price skyrocketed as they scrambled to get involved. I suspect the same thing will happen in India once it becomes more well known.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:12:40
This is how the story would have ended for me.
    Me: "Hey friend, can I borrow 1 BTC?"
    Friend: "What is a BTC?"
    Me: ":("
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:31:17
In theory, it would be nice to have. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:31:29
It is a good time to start. If you can afford to lose that 10 dollars, I would put it in. If not, I would wait until you can afford to lose the money that you're putting in.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:40:43
Merchants should take into account the volatility of Bitcoin, especially since we are only in the early stages of the currency. While I do think this crash may scare away a few merchants, I suspect there will still be an influx of merchants who have done their research and are willing to put their faith into Bitcoin for their business.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:18:14
If we can get it again, it would most definitely help with spreading the word.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:49:00
It is all based on the ease of transferring money in and out of the different exchanges. BTC is usually cheap on btc-exchange when compared to mtgox and coinbase because it is harder to get money into it.
People will pay more to the ease of buying and selling BTC. If you are willing to jump through a few hoops, then you can probably get BTC for cheaper.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:22:28
Nothing is ever 100% safe. Yes, there have been people who have lost their btc on coinbase, but there have also been people who have lost it on other exchanges, or misplaced their paper wallet, or had their USB fail. There are people who will argue for one thing, while others will argue against it. The safest method is to probably do what hey_wait_a_minute suggested. To make a paper wallet, copy the file and pw protect it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:37:54
I'm going to have to second this.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:04:17
I suspect this number will rise even further come next week.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:28:58
The funny thing is, everything he said will probably be true.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:15:55
It will even itself out, nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:43:27
The media could only ignore Bitcoin for so long. Pretty soon all major news networks will be covering Bitcoin as they scramble to get involved.
Congratulations my friends, we're getting there!
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:17:00
Yes, but you can always change it back if it truly bothers you. Although I would suggest adapting to the change!
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:23:21
You would probably reduce the price of a Bitcoin for a little bit.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:16:52
Can't wait for the 2nd coming then.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:35:44
Is there any guarantee that the btc we send to that address will actually make it to those who are homeless?
I'm not accusing you of taking the money for yourself, I'm just trying to be practical. Anyone who would want to donate would probably want to be assured that their money is reaching those who need it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:56:52
Great job man!
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:32:36
This is all good news for Bitcoin. We should all do what we can to spread the word.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:43:48
Could it? Yeah, but I do not think it will be judging by the teaser trailer. It looks to be something else.
It would be great for Bitcoin if it was and Jeff talked about how amazon would be implementing Bitcoin as a payment. However, I feel like we will have to wait a little bit longer before we see that.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:31:47
Yeah, It would probably be a good idea to contact him and hopefully get some more insight into this topic. He was pretty much able to get the Bitcoin community to trust Bitcointip.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:28:04
No, and I think for a vast majority of us, it has made us more charitable. You've probably seen the bitcointip bot more than once, and have heard stories of people receiving large sums of money for making no more than a simple comment in a thread. 
Personally, I think Bitcoin has really brought out the good in a lot of people.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:59:21
"Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy."
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:26:03
I would seek advice from a local accountant then. I have seen numerous "theories" here on reddit about taxes for Bitcoins. However, since we don't all live in the same place and abide by the same rules, a local accountant would probably have a better idea than most of us here as to the tax laws that pertain to you.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:41:59
Pretty much the same opinion/experience from me.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:49:05
Welcome to the community!
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:36:09
I plan on doing the same thing tonight!
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:51:09
If you keep everything in Bitcoin, then you have nothing to worry about for now. The moment you spend those Bitcoins for goods, or sell the Bitcoins for USD, you will have to worry about taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:51:59
You want us to send you Bitcoins so you can test with them before sending them back? That doesn't sound fishy at all. You know you can buy small amounts of Bitcoins to test with yourself from many different exchanges out there. Check out coinbase.com or MtGox. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:56:40
Yes, especially with the great new coming out of China.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:23:16
I found myself doing the same thing. At first, I would check the price a few times a day, and as time went on I slowly stopped looking. Not because I didn't care, but because I found the other aspects of Bitcoin more interesting.
I feel like this may be common for anyone who truly believes in Bitcoin and is interested to see its' potential.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:06:15
Ideally, you are right. However, the goal is to get them interested. It is free to create more wallets, so once they know how to do that, they can create a new one and just transfer the money out.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:12:03
What a great day to be part of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:02:57
Same, but maybe they can see into the future? I hope.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:02:42
If you only had one copy of your wallet and it was on your hard drive...I'm sorry. There is no 1-800 number for all of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:16:21
Sigh, people like this do nothing but hurt the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:24:13
Unless you are getting free energy, no, it would be extremely difficult to make a profit at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:17:50
They wish.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:38:13
That sounds fishy. Personally, I've never received a message unless I was trying to log into my account. You already said you changed your password, which is good. Just keep any eye on your account for now and don't click any fishy links!
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:18:51
I have been struggling to think of a reason for altcoins for a while now. I think you hit the nail on the head though. Thank you for your post!
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:18:13
This could be an interesting idea. However, how would you guarantee to those sending money into the pot that the one collecting it all won't just disappear with it once it gets big enough?
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:37:52
This is great news! I've been a fan of TeamLiquid for quite some time. I can't wait to grab some of their gear with Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:46:04
I feel bad for those who don't realize that these altcoins are being manipulated.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:56:25
Suggesting this to your boss wouldn't hurt. Think of it this way, introducing Bitcoin to your business will not stop your usual customers from buying your products because they will continue to pay in cash or however they were accustomed to paying. Adding Bitcoin as a payment option will attract those who are looking to support businesses, especially big businesses that adopt Bitcoin.
So, in the end you will continue to get business from your usual customers, while adding a new consumer group on top of that. I seriously doubt it would hurt the business anymore than they are already hurting. Personally, I don't see the old customers all of the sudden boycotting your Papa Johns because they now accept Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:19:10
Believe me, buyers will pop out of the woodwork the moment they hear about a crash.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:41:56
Case closed.
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:16:20
This was actually interesting to read. You can definitely match a few people in this subreddit to these different types.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:36:46
In truth, a lot of coins will disappear because of this. However there are many ways to make sure that they don't when you do pass away.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:05:14
I've never heard of this witcoins guy before, however your post has made me extremely interested in learning more about this stranger and his hatred towards Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:14:01
If you're really that worried, just sell them once you receive payment. You will only take a small hit, probably less than 10 dollars per payment. If I were you though, I would be excited to receive Bitcoin as a payment.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:16:09
This is good to hear. It will be interesting to watch if this trend continues, or stabilizes for a little bit after the holidays.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:29:42
My guess would be your order got caught up in the high demand of orders before the holiday. Due to Thanksgiving everything is moving a little bit slower in Coinbase because many of their employees are American. I wouldn't worry too much about it, as long as you are getting the amount of Bitcoins that you bought for the price that you paid. If either of those things differ than what you saw on the 22nd, I would contact Coinbase customer support.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:17:01
Woo! This is great news!
