So weird how you guys keep bringing up bitcoin cash in replies to me despite me not saying a word about it.  You guys seem very insecure about your decision.

You unironically post in all day calling people racist nazis.  You're a far left nut job, regardless if you're communist or not.  
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:04:57
Zero successful implementations of communism and counting.

If you enjoy correcting lies and misinformation I would assume you hang out in both subs equally.

Bitcoin losing dominance is an objective fact.  I never even mentioned bitcoin cash in my entire comment.  It's easy to tell you're delusional when you're arguing with your own hallucinations.

The network did hard fork.  Almost half of the community moved to that fork.  Maybe the fact that a sizable chunk of the community left is responsible for low fees, not SW or batching.

I can't tell if you're serious or if you're trolling.  Well done.

The developers of the lightning network say Blockstream encouraging people to use lightning network on main net is reckless and will result in money loss.  There is no product that is ready to be used yet, and this post implying there is of course is a lie.  But of course with blocks full, transactions taking forever, and bitcoin losing dominance on a daily basis, I can sympathize with your need to lie to yourself and the community.

I don't know about "changing the world" but it's certainly keeping the SEC well funded and lots of fraud investigators gainfully employed.

Over 95% of bitcoins are held by 3% of wallets.  The deal with crypto currency is it's actually worse than fiat.  Nearly all of it is held by exchanges.  Aka banks.

A simple comparison to online users in this sub vs will reveal you lost a lot more than 10% of the users.  They usually have half the online users as this sub, so I'd estimate you guys lost between 30-40% of your community.

Except their market cap is real and bitcoins is a totally made up calculation that's both meaningless and not in any way comparable to that of real companies.
