You mean 50 Gryffincoins to Gryffindor?
Dumbledore bought the 'dip' at 11k on a Hogwarts triple-mortgage.

Good to see you sold at $20k my dude! Have you bought back in yet or does your research indicate the price will go lower and you're waiting for the better price?
At least doesn't lie to itself.

As long as we're all prepared to deal with the consequences or lack there of.
Auditing the Fed is like firing an arrow straight up into the air and scattering.

I'm not sure you're grasping the latest research here. The "bad upbringing" is causing the physical deficits. I'm at work or I'd link some great research on the impact of just *poverty* on mental mass and cortical surface area, let alone further topics discussing traumatic events and unstable homes.
I mean, shit, lead exposure? Pre-natal vitamins? A healthy diet? All intrinsic to or missing from a 'bad upbringing'.


The alternative is to lock them up forever. Warehousing them because "we are no where near [psychological treatment, medication, stable circumstances]". 
I'll let you decide what's ethical, in the meantime, save your binary broken/unbroken brain mythos.

We really need to redo, as an entire society, how we think of justice.
We have the whole of advanced neuroscience out here telling us that free will and choice are myths. That the mind is simply conditioned, at the very deepest levels, from the very beginning of life, to think, act, and respond to the stimuli of the world.
Prison should be a place about reconditioning that mind, to react differently to those stimuli.
And as a nation founded on Enlightenment principles, we should remember this:


But I just guess that wouldn't make millions of dollars from the state for locking up the poor for being poor.

I see a lot of people in this thread confusing Libertarianism, as a philosophy, with Libertarianism, as a social structure.

The dude is avowed swastika-wearing Nazi. He believes that minorities are an inferior race and that non-whites should be "removed" from the country.
