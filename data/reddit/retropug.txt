Short squeeze i recon , as lots of traders were shorting when BTC reached $4150 with tight stop losses at about $4250. So it did not take much movement until all their stop losses were automatically triggered which pumped the price quickly.

If we can break $4250 and close above that, this could encourage more buyer next week. Fingers &amp; toes crossed.

Look at Mr Shifty Eyes in the back ground, he is moving his bitcoins off the exchange with his phone to keep them safe from Sherman.
