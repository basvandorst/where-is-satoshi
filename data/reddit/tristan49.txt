Viewing bitcoin as a way to deal drugs and launder money is nonsense. Seems a bit ignorant on their part.
Is the Canadian dollar not a legitimate currency just because it exchanges hands with a drug dealer? No.

I clicked the link and it brought me to my ChangeTip Profile and said the tip was collected from SatoshisGhost. I didn't even have to login! :D

Wow, very nice design! I'm glad this is a software and not a web client. Great work!
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:11:48
People are paid to write articles like this? Wow.

Just submitted my email - looks awesome!
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:57:56
Wow - this is awesome. I can definitely see myself doing this. Thanks u/The_Hox!

I love both which is why I hold both. I believe Litecoin does have some very useful features such as the confirmation times. That being said, I believe there is much more to be done with it.  As the community grows and the dev team starts implementing more features, I think we will see Litecoin as the prominent  coin.

Cool! I just signed up! Looking forward to seeing what this is!

After reading it, I had the exact same thoughts as you. Very well written and to the point. This is what people need, an easy way to get the basic information.

Aren't you a smart cookie ;)

I can't help but feel bad for him, all because of some journalist who went way too far.

Took me about 3-5 days, wait a bit longer.

The beginning of the end. Cheers to a better 2015 without them!

Cool, thanks!

Does the app need to be on all the time or can it be in the background?

Also interesting to point out that a number of nodes are private - which means we will not know the total number both public and private! Safe to assume we are over 7000 though!

I'm running the same setup, but with an external HDD. Works great! :)

My first lightning tip!!! Thank you! :) 
@_date: 2019-01-01 22:25:02
I've been with Bitcoin since 2015 - but the Lightning Network is making me so giddy about the future. So neat to transact such a small amount of money with basically no fees! 
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:12:36
Happy New Year everyone! Looking forward to setting up a lightning node in 2019!!
@_date: 2019-01-02 04:30:08
Woah - thanks a lot! I really appreciate that :) Happy New Year to you
