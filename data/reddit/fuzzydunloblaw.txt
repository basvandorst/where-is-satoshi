Hm YMCAlostandfoundboxcoincash has a ring to it. Do I just give you my money or do I have to wait for the ico?

I've heard of ass pennies, but now you're saying the bitcoin I bought came from ztsmart's ass?

I'm starting to think there's something fishy going on with this fella.

Those words are all stupid. Can you explain it in a way that is a million times easier?

I turned a corner on hummus. Always thought it was a terrible thing invented for hippies but then I happened across some garlic type hummus and dipped some of that wacky bread into and my mind was blown. Also brussel sprouts are not terrible. This was a good talk.

What if the hand wandered off mysteriously and could potentially wander back someday and feed you poison? It could even be an impostor hand that wanders back. Or a quantum hand backed by a deep-pocketed government state with an interest in destroying the original hand's vision. This whole metaphor is stretching thin. I mean, they could leave like a thousand bitcoins transferable for whoever the returning hand may be, just not enough that a sudden movement in it would endanger the whole ecosystem.

Uh oh, are you into underage feet or something?

Uh oh. I propose a fs-btc (fuck-satoshi-in-particular) fork of bitcoin wherein all his coins are forever frozen in place and unmovable no matter what, but everything else remains the same.
