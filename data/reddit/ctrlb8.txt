* **My fans is loyal and im leading that charge like a red alert tesla coil**    
YTC has many supporters. His movement is compared to a Command and Conquer defense unit, that builds up energy until it is released as a powerful force. Red Alert is a particularly old member of the C&amp;C series, further alluding to YTC's age.
* **From us soil stateside solid state drive Encoded with the data that i need to survive**  
YTC is from the USA, and is subject to their government's attempts at internet liberty infringement. He uses SSD's to store much of his data. He needs that data safe and secure, as it's security is essential to his well-being.
* **Against a hive mind drones that would stand to deny mine How they treat us hackers it would serve as a guide line**
The hive mind of the American public is a mob mentality. This functions as the enforcers and enablers of the oppressive government (that is in opposition to YTC's goals), much like drones in modern warfare. The analogy is furthered as public opinion of hackers is widely fearful and not in favor, making the targeting that much easier.
* **1984 they got a fix on the timeline**
A reference to George Orwell's 1984, which paints a picture of a dystopian future under rule of an extremist, radical, totalitarian, authoritarian government. YTC believes our own reality is moving towards that direction, given enough time and little resistance.
* **I grind mine in the name of computer crime i'm Vicious - still all about the business Holding grudges and forgoing forgiveness**
YTC continues to engage in his activities. His use of grind, a common rap vernacular, is also a reference (and equally appropriate in meaning) to the common RPG activity of grinding--engaging in tasks that better develop one's character, abilities, and inventory. He does this in the name of his transgressions, which he sees as a movement against oppression and in the name of freedoms. Despite his idealogical goals, he still does not waiver from acquiring income. His crimes are akin to freedom fighting, and he does not take opposition to his idealogy/practices lightly.
* **Cause i witness people on the scene with a sickness Snitching on their friends for a deal with a quickness**  
Continuing from the previous lyric, he is slow to forgive and forget as he has witnessed sickening behavior from others in his field. When caught and subject to legal penalties, some of his colleagues have given up their accomplices to the authorities in exchange for lightened sentencing. He has seen how easily people turn. Witness is particularly appropriate here, holding a double entendre of him witnessing others turn witness.
* **Hammond hit a backdoor broke up into stratfor
On the orders of a government actor
But they dont factor any of that in his sentencing
"hes menacing; an anarchist subversive whos peddling
The wrong ideology"
Get them hackers to follow me 'fore they bottle me**  
YTC shows his support for the stratfor hacker and whistleblower Jeremy Hammond. Hammond shares a similar idealogy to YTC, and was also indicted through an accomplice disclosing Hammond's identity to the authorities. He is painted as someone with a destructive idealogy, much like YTC, despite his intentions being pure. YTC is wary of his accomplices, current and prospective, as they may have been set to capture him redhanded in his illicit activities.
* **Cause i gotta be an oddity set up in the music economy**  
YTC sarcastically notes that despite emerging and developing thoughts about creative industries and their distributions (which have been molded as such due to technology), he is still considered a rogue; he is the one in the wrong when there is a clear example of society shaping itself with accordance to his views in the new music economy.
* **Theyre on to me cause im still a computer prodigy
No modesty when it comes to hacking the planet**  
YTC is too good for his endeavors to not be noticed, and he is also on the radar due to bragging about his abilities. His actions are on a massive scale, so he sees no point in being modest when it's impossible he won't be noticed. Hacking the planet also implies that he is so good, he is changing the way the world works. 
* **Spitting on a microphone or puffing organic**  
YTC further shows no modesty/brags when it comes to his rapping ability and how good his ganja is/how much ganja he can consume.
 
* **Represent defendants like im jennifer granick**  
Through his own justice, he supports those who cannot support themselves through a similar field as Jennifer Granick defends. Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties for the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, and has represented many high-profile hackers in court cases. 
* **Hacker mechanic sending science all across the atlantic
Dont panic**  
He is dedicated to spreading knowledge all over the world, and asks you to keep calm should it result in any radical changes you are not accustomed to.

You're right. They sent one.

Fuck yes indeed thanks a whole lot man!

* **(im an internet pirate) starship pilot**  
He loots files without paying for them. He also gets high. This may also be a nod to 'the moon', a goal of many investors in cryptocurrency. Piloting the starship implies he believes he got in early, on the 'pilot' run. This would mean he has some wealth given the bitcoin explosion in November 2013.
* **Trying to keep my actions private**  
He believes in privacy, most likely achieved through encryption protocols.
* **Wardial it product of the 1980s spectrum ultraviolet**  
YTC was active since the late 1980s. The ultraviolet part of the light spectrum is in the higher energy section, typically depicted on the right. He nods to his roots with wardialing, which was a hacking technique used in the days when modems operated through phone numbers. For reference, recall (or for millenials, look up) the AOL modem phone sounds. THAT internet old.
* **Deep purple smoke on the water till the bottom fall out**  
Many layers to this lyric. Deep Purple wrote the song, Smoke on the Water, and it is widely considered a drug song. This is a nod to YTC's ganja smoking, with him putting so much smoke through his bong that it bubbles enough to have the bottom break off. Another layer, is that this song is on the album Machine Head, and many also consider it a telling of the composition of that album. This meshes with YTC's technology background, and how he has been around since the composition of the modern internet.
* **Of all this hacking im doing till my rep is in ruin**  
YTC hacks so much, which is largely considered an illicit activity, that he is gaining the attention of authorities. His reputation to the public, as a result, may not be able to recover once he breaks some threshold of hacking activity.
* **Tryin to make the best of a movement**  
YTC is fully engaged in the internet/tech movement, taking full advantage of the modern 'wild west'. With regulation/patches forming as exploits are exposed, he is capitalizing on any aspects he can as this brave new world finds a stability.
* **Steady pursuing a fluency to see what theyll do to me**  
Fluency is especially appropriate here as he likely operates through numerous languages of code. He stays up to date on developing languages and exploits consistently, and has gotten away with it despite how long he's been in the 'game'. He is bragging that despite how many new developments have sprung up, he's established exploitable mastery over each one with no repercussions. 
* **Im an internet virus**  
YTC can infiltrate machines, persons of interest (both sexually and non-sexually), and everything else like an internet virus, and he cannot be stopped, as he constantly changes and adapts to whatever exploits are made available. His music also spreads virally/like a virus, with many people being 'infected' much the same way as a virus--clicking on things.
* **Proficient with devices that require a stylus**  
His expertise extends to mobile devices as well, demonstrating mastery over anything technological.
* **I admit i got a bias towards any batch of silicon that be rockin a BIOS**
YTC prefers hardware, which is composed of silicon, that utilizes the BIOS firmware. BIOS allows weaker hardware to boot more demanding programs, though it is unlikely he is using weaker hardware. This is likely a nod to his age in the game, as BIOS was largely dominant in the 80s.
* **Dont DENY this firewall rules apply this** 
Don't reject what he's been revealing. Even if you do, he will bypass your denial as easily as he bypasses firewalls.
* **Puter hepatitis all on disc sell a fix Call it ransomware**  
Puter means Computer, and hepatitis is a deadly viral infection of the liver. He infects machines and puts their contents onto discs while he wrecks havoc on the machine. Once they clean-wipe everything to salvage their computers, he 'ransoms' their files back to them, exchanging them for monetary gain. To maintain anonymity, this is likely done through cryptocurrencies.  
* **get me a handsome heir For the throne when my ass be gone**  
He is currently sitting on the throne, as YTC considers himself king/the best. Eventually, he will leave the game. Since no one is of equal caliber to his skills, he hopes that his successor will at least be good looking. Handsome can also mean a candidate that appears strong, so he may also be asking for the best they can find.
* **I got a phone (tether up)**  
YTC uses his phone to convert his data plans into internet supply (tethering).
* **Riding on chrome (talking bout the browser pup)**  
YTC prefers to use chrome to surf the web, due to its v8 javascript engine that helps combat potentially unwanted programs.
* **Im a force of nature rpg pen and the paper**  
He plays pen and paper role playing games (RPGs). A typical one is dungeons and dragons, and the genre is typically associated with the nerd/geek subculture. He demonstrates his immersion in all aspects/activities of what his archetype partake in. Pen and paper RPGs are also the precursors to modern RPGs like final fantasy, pokemon, skyrim, etc., further alluding to his age in the game. Lastly, many RPGs employ some element of magic, which is often used to manipulate/summon the forces of nature up to a massive scale. He is as unstoppable as the high-level RPG magic skills that produce massive forces of nature.
* **Code breaker data scraper**  
Further allusion to how he exploits computer code, effectively leaving it 'broken' for future entry until some patch intervention is performed. He also harvests data/information/files for future use, whether it be to sell or otherwise.
* **Admin on a rampage the spampage Beckoning a series of clicks on my cam page**  
An admin is one with the highest level of control to a network. YTC's 'network' is the entirety of machines, and he is on a rampage exploiting everything he can. One such example is his traffic harvesting, generating false clicks/traffic for monetary gain.
* **Im showing my damn age Everytime i reminisce about the "good ol days"**
Everytime he mentions one of his internet hustles, it demonstrates how long he's been in the game. This lyric implies the days are not as good as before, as systems are not as ripe/easy to exploit and many of his easiest/favorite hustles have been patched.
* **But them days ain't over Cuz im still up on the block standing head and shoulders In them inbox folders out foxin mulders with a methodThat will leave the block smoldered Cuz im a dragon dictating my ethos**  
Despite his easiest/favorite exploits from 'the good ol' days' getting patched, he still maintains dominance in his endeavors and has not been deterred. He is on the winner's block (1/2/3 place podium). Head and shoulders is a nod to his cryptocurrency trading; the head and shoulders pattern on the blocks implies he is both the head (1st place) and the shoulders (2nd and 3rd place). YTC is saying he is leagues better than the competition, even seasoned hackers who have their own established ways of performing. His skill is so hot that it leaves the blocks he stands on in flames. This allusion is furthered by his comparison to a dragon, a fire-breathing mythical beast also found in many RPGs. Dragon is also a reference to the voice-recording software of the same name. He writes his own rules much like dragon writes whatever the hell it wants to, regardless of what you spoke to it.
* **The beat goes on and i hack the gibson**  
Life still goes on, as does the developing technology. Even with all these changes, YTC's hacks have gone deep enough that the changing 'beat' is not of any concern, as he's far in enough the instrument that he's always one step ahead. The gibson is the guitar that produces the beats. Gibson may also be a nod to a reputed programmer, Steve Gibson, who was involved in some vulnerability exploit controversies.
* **Root admission bitching bout the government mission On attrition pimpin whos the master of this science fiction**  
Root admission bitching means either his highest domain concern, or a concern coming straight from the top of the hierarchy (YTC himself). This concern is about mass government actions and attempts to limit/reduce the liberties of the internet/people in general. He asks the listener who he would believe/prefer to be in control of this new, futuristic frontier.
 
* **(im an internet bandit) stoned as granite**
YTC doesn't care who the master is, as he'll do whatever he pleases anyway and is a master in his own domain. His proficiency is amplified that he does this all under the influence of ganja. He is as high as granite is stoned, which is very much/often. Granite is a common, commercial (often) rock that is stoned out of many different types of rocks/crystals/minerals (very much). By consuming ganja, he further shows no regard for the law, as marijuana is illegal.
* **Trying to keep my landers landed**  
YTC tries not to get too ahead of himself, despite his immense ability. Landers are an extremely advanced technology that allows surface exploration of other planets. He is equally as capable in exploring the frontier of the internet, but it is a struggle to suppress his talent.
* **Then spam it collect a bunch of clicks on a hypertext canvas**
He is involved in click-harvesting/spamming/traffic generating, done through a computer screen. This hustle generates income for him.
* **Do my damndest to keep the advantage**
He always try to stay one step ahead.
* **Brandishing a package of packets of dirty bandwidth To jam with build a stack and feed em a sandwich From a campus box that i rooted in the middle of kansas**  
He can collect data and resources that is not his from anywhere, including the resources available to universities in obscure locations. He can use these resources to 'jam' targets, essentially force feeding them more than they can chew.

I guess a better word would have been fees to my living and financial freedom. We have great services like order online food, reservation placing online, Amazon, etc. and it's ridiculous if you want to use them, you have to use this outdated model of pulling out your credit card and typing/speaking 16 letters. It's outdated technology, and it costs fees. Most places I get food from cost a little extra to use card. I meant that I should have access to the buy-it-now/buy-it-anywhere merchant system of the internet without being taxed through credit cards, where they'll remain in balance to be approved for x days/x hours.

Bitcoin is the occupy wall street movement reborn, but this time around we have a way to protest: we can put our wealth away as a physical, noticeable means of protest against the gross financial practices in establishment. Best part? It's where it hurts them most. Their pockets. I'm not for abolishing banks or down with the system, but this can cause noise that will force a shift towards the right direction in a way nothing else will.
To the moon.

Well first, fuck you.
but then I think your type is great. You're greedy, so you're giving bitcoin some % of your wealth anyway, and when you see holding in BTC rewards you vs the stress of trading an uphill battle, you'll play a longer game. And once that swing turns, your greed will have created a movement, and those rational enough to have kept a foot in the door will still reap a healthy reward. This will just cycle, possibly exponentially, once people start speculating bitcoin far more than its worth. In that time, the technology will ultimately follow bc the only thing in its way is merchant acceptance [amazon/netflix/local pizza]. Once your monster shows it's literally money to be spent instantly, without typing out 4017 or registering for some shitty site, it'll have squeezed enough investment out of you as you have of it.
