He also tweeted people should calm down on the price, it can work at $20 too. I think the “conflict-free” line was a way to lock in profits while seeming like he wasn’t announcing the price was too high.

My point is that there are now more coinbase accounts than morgan Stanley accounts. Everyone and their brother is in already. 9/10 people can’t tell you what a block chain is, they’re only buying because of FOMO and the get rich quick nature of an “investment” that’s grown 100x this year.
There are hundreds of thousands of Wall Street traders, wholesalers and executives. They are the sharks and the water is chummy. You’re underestimating how fucking smart Wall Street is, and how dumb the public is when it comes to making money.

There are over 13 million coinbase accounts. I suppose you think they are all millennials and mom/pops?

It’s your job to prove what the price was, not the IRS’ job. Just like old stock buys before cost basis was standard. I would agree with posters below... round up.

Not if the public sees a 50% drop from the high.

20% of the accounts are 80% of the money.
For every 4 $100 accounts,  there is a much, much bigger account. Don’t act like you don’t see all the redditors with tiny deposits.
This is not a secret. Nobody now is a ground floor investor. This is bubble territory, dominating CNBC. The public is in, and the sharks are circling.

He invested 1% a few years ago. The stake grew to 50%. He is now trying to unwind the position per the interview.

Making a market is different than going long and selling covered contracts.

You can bet that institutional money will be buying and selling bitcoin along with those futures to find arbitrage profits. 
These firms put in million dollar machines and huge cables to front run stock and etf trades for 100ths of a penny.

Every day you have an asset you make a decision to buy, sell or hold (HODL). If you can’t afford to lose your gains, you need to begin systematically selling until you reach a place where you are comfortable holding.
While losing it all would technically only render you down 10k, the truth is you had an opportunity to lock in gains that would positively change your life. 
If you can’t afford to lose it, take it off the table.

Dow market cap of 5-6 Trillion would be much more significant than the nominal dollar value of a single “basket of shares adjusted for splits and dividends” that the Dow price is now

But the inherent value because someone is willing to pay with it is a bogus idea. Paper checks never bought holders a Lamborghini and it’s accepted everywhere. 
The ability to transfer value isn’t worth much in today’s world.

Disagree. That’s why the attacks can be more savage.
With a stock, the company can fire the ceo, go private, get bought by another for its assets and cash flow. Without a capitalistic market there is no floor on something with 0 fundamental valuation.

Whether you buy in USD or bitcoin, food companies keep shrinking the packaging and upping the prices. This is for profits and to keep up with increasing labor, regulation, insurance and operations costs.
Don’t kid yourself into thinking they wouldn’t raise the price of your nuggets in crypto.
