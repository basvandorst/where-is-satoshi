If you own 1 btc. How rich are you. ?

This answer just not made me happy. It's just made me sad because I see how fucked up this world can be. 170 years of work for a single Bitcoin. That's 3 or 4 generations of labour.

I see no difference from people posting new Gucci, BMW or their latest PlayStation on social. 
It's dumb yes.

Best part about hong kong that its a real currency city.  
Most people have a multi currency account, People can easily switch over their savings to another currency by 1,2,3, clicks.  
If HKD falls (paired with USD), they pump the Yuan or EURO. and vice versa, even with the Japanese Yen.

It's easy to blame WU. All other traditional institutions work like this. So far I can read there is actually 2 people I can blame in this story. You who forgets to cash in the cheque and the renter for using WU. 
They are just a company who wants to makes money out of stupid people.

Please don't. All red lights turns on as a typical FOMO investor.
Probably one of the first ones to bail out when BTC drops to $6000.

1995 is a bit off. That's when isp are connected. 
TCP IP protocol goes back earlier. 
But counting from 95 , in 2000 , 5 years later there were more people using www. then 5 years after Bitcoin

Uhm . That's basic Bitcoin 101. I just don't see the usergrowth from internet usage and btc users has to be compared in the first post. 
Revolutionary tech and user adoption are measured in 1 benchmark here. That's not the way to do it if you want to pinpoint out how crypto is a revolutionair monetary system

14k modem was out in 94. Was top line in 95.
Pre 95 was 9600 baud or slower. 
Maybe you are rightm that is it closer to 1990

Taking off in November, before that accumulate!
@_date: 2019-09-12 10:59:09
My guess is around 93-94

[Crypto.com]( is legit
Depending on your location you can buy with:
Creditcard -3.5% fee  
Sepa bank transfer - 0% fee  
Bank wire - Your banks international wire fee  
ACH - (not sure about this one)  
Cashback with visa card is depending on your tier and MCO balance stacked. from 2%-5% (if your country is eligible)

How can you say it's accurate? It has a 6000 dollar Gap in between the lines during a accumulation fase. 
So if the price is moving anywhere between 7000-13000 during the past 3 months and future 3 months that graphic is accurate.

Welcome to the club. I got hacked in binance. A shitload of Chainlink got sold into btc and then transfered out of binance. They also somehow could deactivate 2fa. 
All I got from binance was a lousy cap and a umbrella

Maybe this trader is killed in action. 
Stop day trading or you will end up with a KIA.
