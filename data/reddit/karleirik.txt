If you look closely, you see that it notifies him of upcoming events. The breakfast is in a month

Well, some find it easier. Anyway, I'm just giving the option

Thank you, it was an investment to save up for an education, and since I'm thinking of studying abroad I needed some extra money. Or I might stay where I am and since Uni is free in Norway, the money might go to an apartment instead
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:42:48
I will if the price goes the way I want it too
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:30:18
Thank you for that. The money was meant for an education, but I have more than I need so I might reinvest later on

I'm pretty much done with Krypto

 Here's a screenshot for those who wants to share the text. With the source link in the bottom.

Yeah, but they are kinda expensive with a 75m2 apartment costing upwards of kr5'000'000 ($625'000) if you want to be able to work in Oslo without using 2 hours each way from work.

They are really nice about it in Norway, got to pay 2-4% in taxes

I was going to use the money to buy an apartment, if I decide to stay here to get a degree, or I'll find a country that has the education I want and move there. In 2-3 years. Until then I'll see if I find something with a value I trust.

I have more money than I need for my education, so I might invest the rest of it if Bitcoin goes up
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:03:06
I sold at 16, if it dips, I'll buy. If not I still made a lot of money. And I might buy 1 or 2 bitcoin if it goes straight up
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:37:02
No problem, hope they enjoy : )

So, I sold my BTC for $16K each, the total is enough to pay for my education and maybe an apartment. 
My topic is; Should I buy again if it goes up right away, or should I just leave the BTC trading community?
(Please be nice and keep the discussion civil and on topic.)
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:59:31
I was planning to do that, but I feel like I should either keep it all, invest some in BTC if it goes up or wait a bit if it goes down
