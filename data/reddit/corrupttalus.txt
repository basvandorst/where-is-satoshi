Indeed, non-US regulated markets and services like ShapeShift, private/anonymous coins... I can’t see how this wouldn’t be easily sidestepped. Platforms like Binance don’t even verify.

This, is going to be extremely, extremely difficult to track for both tax paying traders and enforcers. But expected. If a new low fee quick sending coin is massively adopted by retailers, the US would lose billions more.

Correct. It’s an annoying (albeit, strategic) way for them to pick up cheap coins, knowing the price on them will recover.

Whales have been known to crash the price down to take out the stops. Expect this to happen at least between now and the fork, and as we get closer to $10K (which looks like it will happen simultaneously).
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:44:47
Absolutely, but each email I get from them states something slightly different. They went from BTC will stay bitcoin, to we will go with whichever has the highest difficulty to we “may decide” to go with the one with higher difficulty...... Make a firm decision and stick with it. And if you review new info and think you need to go in a different direction say “after careful review, this is the new course”... People are making very expensive decisions off this platform, so I’d appreciate some firm booted decisions instead of “we may possibly at a later time maybe”.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:41:23
Better sell at $6999 then... otherwise it may tumble down with you
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:35:36
So is this saying if I move my BTC from GDAX to a hard wallet at the time of the fork that I won’t get B2x?

Love the platform, but their leadership team is shyt, and need to make up their minds.

After rereading it, it’s not as bad as I thought. But this is the email that should have come out before instead of the one they sent. I understand they are a new team doing what they can though. I’m see this platform becoming better and better.

My bad... That’s where I bought more, sorry to ruin the fun for everyone.....
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:30:04
Do you usually get them filled pretty instantly? And no fees meaning no gas either or just no exchange fees to GDAX ?
I've been wanting to try this out for a while. I ran into the same thought about $100 not being enough to really make anything. But if I could just make lunch money with it, it's a win.

Nothing, but it's way more profitable (and safer) to just keep building it as a legit company. I wouldn't trade on any exchanges without a lot of history, and even then don't keep lots of coins on there at any one time. Transfer to a paper or hard wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:48:19
Yeah, bank account 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:50:22
Just enough to make a quick trade if I wanted to sell off or trade into another currency. I would keep at most 10-15% on if I'm expecting to make a move.
I hard wallet though, so it's hard if I'm out in the world and the price tanks, I might be shyt outta luck until I get to my wallet. But I prefer the security. At a time like this where it's going to be super volatile, I might keep much more in the exchange to catch the bottoms of a dip.
But again, it's all up to how much your risk tolerance is. I don't own enough crypto to freak out about it.

Multiple security vulnerabilities being exploited. In exchanges or otherwise. Which is another reason to hard wallet.
