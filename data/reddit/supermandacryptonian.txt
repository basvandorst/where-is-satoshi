It really does help a lot of people. When you have bitcoin it feels like you already living in the future. Because it is a big money compared to fiat money. 1 BTc is worth 7k or 8k right now. so with just 1 BTC, Y are already have a big amount of money. It can also make each and every country go rich.  That's why I do invest BTC because it is a big help to us.

This is great. I mean people don't usually bring a lot of money with them. They just care sometimes $100 or less but if the hospital service would be bigger than $100 they can just get their phone and scan some coins there.

I agree.
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:22:30
That's what my point is.  What they are doing is They are making BCH a low-key investment.

Great job! Welcome to the community. My  GUT says you will enjoy trading in cryptoworld. lol
@_date: 2018-06-19 12:17:16
Thank you for sharing. I prefer hodling. than trading because when it comes to trading sometimes when the price gets high enough you become tempt to sell it. But when you are hodling you just do nothing. just monitoring your coins and when the right time comes that is the time you sell it.

Google did this because they want people to know that btc has a higher value than bch. Which is for me, It unnecessary since they are both coin that people liked and appreciated.
Btc = cash
Bch = Change

I agree BTC ATM is every where now.

Is it really good to have lightning network for your BTC?
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:01:45
I'll give you my address then send it to that address. Then I will tell you if its working or not :D lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:47:06
For me, I think it will really be helpful. I mean It can encourage people to buy more since its lessen the fees.
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:19:25
Very Clever!  I can't wait to buy vegetables using BTC lol
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:12:50
Great article. Bitcoin is on the move again. I hope it reaches 10k today.
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:23:18
Bitcoin is the 1st largest cryptocurrency
