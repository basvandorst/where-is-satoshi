Story of my life.

Trust me, *at most* 1% of the morons spewing MGTOW garbage have ever even kissed a girl, much less had a serious long-term relationship. If they did have wives, it's likely they got dumped for putting all the family money into an asset that crashed in value.
They're jealous incels, not experienced wise men.

A car can't get a job and add $100K+ a year to your income. Maybe if you invested in your relationship like you "invest" in a useless vapor currency, your wife wouldn't be going around fucking other people. That's assuming, of course, you've ever even had a wife, which I kind of doubt...

Was it dogecoin?

It's true. I pay for water infrastructure as well, and I have never once drank water. I only drink Mountain Dew. The free market could give me a Mountain Dew faucet directly to my mother's basement. The only thing stopping it is STATISTS.

With bitcoin, countries, like, won't invade other countries man. And like, people won't rape and stuff. There's no *need* for government anymore, man. Have you even read the whitepaper?

Why use bitcoin? Just have the SSA issue public/private keypairs instead of SSNs. Sign your vote with your private key. Bada boom, done. No need to fuck with distribution or mining or double spending or any of that bullshit. It's a problem that needs to be centralized, decentralization will not help.
