Really suspicious. Look at that thread someone else posted a link to a different one where someone made $20K in one night with a "method"... Turns out they lost it all though, check their post history! Oh, and hello fellow HF member :)

I'll give it a try...
Just kidding I have no idea how hacking works.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:35:15
Already tried that, same issue!
@_date: 2013-02-05 07:26:30
That address verification idea is genius!
@_date: 2013-01-24 23:51:43
It hasn't shipped yet.

This seems very sketchy to me... Blogger? Sending people an email with the address to send it to? I'm sorry but for who ever is considering trying this out I would just stick to satoshidice...
EDIT: I submitted my email and it looks as if the emailing is done manually, as I haven't received my email yet after 20 minutes. Are you just gonna copy and paste your bitcoin address into emails and send them out? Seriously. Do not trust this until further notice.

Question: What exchange site did you use? I'm gonna go ahead and guess Mt. Gox...

What does the bitcointip thing mean?

Call them. Call them and as soon as you are connected to the robot start spamming 0 on your phone and saying "Operator". It will connect you to a real person and this is when you be nice. Tell them the situation and when they tell you that there is nothing they can do start raising your voice. Raise your voice and explain every trouble you have ever faced with Paypal and let them know you are a blogger with over 30,000 daily readers. Make sure you remember their name so if they hang up you can ask to be directed to that person (Once you've built up enough pressure to one person they are more likely to hand you to a manager, so this saves time). Once you get a manager you're gonna have to explain your situation again. Try not to raise your voice since these ones are trained to not take your bs. This time just explain your situation like I said and mention you are a blogger and this is your only source of income at the moment: Building and selling rigs. They will not get the money from the scammer. That is totally against their policy (Unless you have proof you sent the items, which you do, so try and do that!). Instead they will credit your PayPal account all the money which you lost in the deal. Once you have done this leave. Don't ever use PayPal again. I was scammed $80 out of a transaction where I delivered the goods but they were intangible, I did the exact steps above and they credited my account. I then searched around and found out that this is what they do when the crediting loss is less than the loss of reputation (ie, media). But seriously, once you get the money back never use PayPal again, because they consider your account to be a liability. Use bitcoin my friend!

Some people have invested $100k+. I wouldn't want 100,000 dollars sitting online.
@_date: 2013-02-07 04:31:58
Please take my advice in that thread if you haven't already :)
@_date: 2013-06-18 03:17:17
Sorry but we're talking about PayPal here. These people are fully aware of how many people the company screws over.
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:36:54
This scares me. Imagine if the buyer sends it to the wrong address so then you guys are just sitting there awkwardly while $500,000 gains confirms... I'd imagine you would do it in payments of $2,500 though!
@_date: 2013-02-02 00:25:54
I'll take you up on this offer once I get my funds back :/
@_date: 2013-01-24 21:19:18
Got this email from them:
Hello Kyle,
Here is the latest on our machines:
My best guess is that you will get your products in a few months.
With appreciation,

I just pre ordered the Jalapeno.
I also just noticed that pre ordering started a long time ago.
Could you give me an estimated time for when mine will be shipped?
@_date: 2013-02-01 23:00:36
Holy shit. Faith in humanity restored. A stranger online tries to empty out his "tip" wallet so I can enjoy bitcoins too :') Even if it doesn't work I still appreciate it dude :)
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:39:03
I live in Victoria! I don't live around these locations though, but I might check it out some time this summer.
@_date: 2013-01-24 21:12:53
I preordered one yesterday. No regrets as its my first investment and I'm guaranteed some money out of it as I don't pay for my electricity.
@_date: 2013-02-05 15:09:15
ah you're probably right...
@_date: 2013-02-03 12:15:48
PLEASE do not force people to go through a 10 step verification of your identity. Oh and also, allow more than US citizens. I know it's more hard than what it seems because of fees/legal issues but as a Canadian 1 hour north of Seattle I hate companies that don't allow Canadians... Just some advise ;)
@_date: 2013-02-05 05:45:18
OF COURSE. 100X OF COURSE. 
But please, listen to me.
1. Allow people outside the US.
2. Don't have A LOT of verification. Some people don't have a fucking utility bill, you know? I'd say picture ID, address verification, and phone verification is good enough in most cases.
3. Have better payout+deposit methods. I don't know if this is possible but maybe do the thing PayPal does where you get the number at the bottom of people's check and then link your bank account and the users?
4. Accept TD cash deposits. Those are awesome. (Not sure if Mt.Gox has this).
5. Allow people to be paid out to PayPal (DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO DEPOSIT FUNDS WITH IT, of course), what's the worst that could happen? Someone sends you the money back? 
There is a lot of other things I could say but that's about it. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-02-02 05:17:15
Wow. This is actually so awesome of you to go through that to help me out :) I'll give it a shot!
@_date: 2013-06-01 16:06:07
Yup lost $400 worth a while ago. If I kept it that would've paid for a lot of shit nowadays...
@_date: 2013-02-02 06:22:46
I've gotten in and registered a nick name. Do I need to do the GPG thing?
