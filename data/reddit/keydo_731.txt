These shameless BCC guys are really using every platform for shilling.

Seems like it

Bitcoin Cash. BCH/BCC

Thanks man. That was exactly what i needed. Back to watching Mr Robot and decorating my christmas tree. (no sarcasm)

What a self wanking shitpost.

Do you know a place where bitcoin or crypto gets discussed with the ruleset prohibiting these dumb shitposts and memes?
I can't stand this sub any longer.
@_date: 2019-03-07 09:27:09
Is there any plan to get rid of all the shitposts and memes reaching the frontpage? The quality of this sub is unbearable.

You probably should'nt post how much BTC you hold, makes you a target.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:49:57
That repost is older than bitcoin. If i recall correctly it was weed growing in the netherlands
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:36:55
NSFW - grammar gore
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:22:24
The "i can't be the only one" meme all over again.

But scraping BCC from my Electrum wallet, to witch i just transfered my BTC from Kraken to, will also work just fine? It seems to me that putting my BTC back on my kraken account seems like an easier way of selling the BCC after the fork.
