Adding to that probability is the fact that the officer "believed" he obtaining the money illegally and instead of detaining him he told him to take the cashier's check and "chalk it up to experience."

Ah, I have - forgot I was on my non-btc tip account. Tip diverted to Sean's Outpost.

Paper wallets are now under the "Addresses" tab.
@_date: 2014-08-21 01:23:12
Thank you!

Maybe, but I think Bitcoin is big enough to allow for both "novice" and "advanced" Users. The card is obviously a novice use case. I don't see anything wrong with that.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:07:40
Apparently the fee gets reduced/eliminated if you connect a bank account. Haven't tried it yet, so I can't confirm.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:57:24
That is a **very** scary pie chart...
@_date: 2014-04-06 19:28:36
2.9% for CC transactions; 0% for bank (ACH) and Google Wallet transactions. Transfers are instant.

That's about as close as you'll get to an EILI5 from the man himself. Or woman. Or people. Whatever.

If you send btc to an email address and they sign up &amp; purchase $100 of btc you will get a referral bonus. Any chance this could be it?

"This small business – total value of a mere $100 million a year ago, now about $10 billion – has generated scores of websites and seemingly unlimited quantities of enthusiastic and evangelistic commentary."
I lol'd a bit when the author referred to bitcoin as a "small business." That's cute.

We're currently working on an interactive "bounty bidding" platform for [Coinality]( which will address this need. It's still in early development, so no timeline yet, but it will be a polished product when released.
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:14:31
VERY slick wallet and sensible integration w/Facebook - nice work!!
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:54:13
Thank you for the feedback! We're currently fundraising to implement some of the points you suggested (particularly, the escrow feature) plus some additional features. Great point on caching - I'll look into fixing that ASAP.
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:53:29
Thank you! The app developer (found on [Coinality]( btw) did an exceptional job!

As far as I understand it, paper wallets can be used like cash and are therefore less traceable than "on-blockchain" transactions. I'm also optimistic that private individual innovation will outpace governmental innovation.

I got the CoinDesk email a couple days ago and just got one today from CoinTelegraph with roughly the same offer. Anyone else?

Nope, it just randomly showed up when I went to compose a new email.

[Bitwage]( is hiring for a couple non-dev positions (Business Development Representative &amp; Compliance Officer). Cointerra is also [hiring a Senior Accountant]( but you're right; most of the employment demand right now is for technical developers. We expect the demand to diversify over time, but right now the focus seems to be on building the technical infrastructure.
There are also a number of [open positions for writers](

I believe Coinkite requires a custom processing terminal.

This is pretty cool. I just tested it to see that it does what you say it does and... it does! I like that it generates a new unique "merchant address" for each visitor. Kudos on a fantastic integration!

Personally, I'd throw most conventional metrics (GP/ACT/etc.) out the window; this helps allow focus on the individual rather than numbers. I'd like to see the funds awarded on a *need* basis rather than *merit* basis; something along the lines of [Kiva.org]( but obviously in the form of a scholarship rather than a loan.
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:49:50
Fantastic idea! If receivable in bitcoin and okay by you, [Coinality.com]( would like to match the $500 for your initial scholarship. PM me if interested.
