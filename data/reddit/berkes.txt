You can see in everything who the actual clients of Google are. Not the users using the search engine, but the companies buying ad-space.
This always leads to "misaligned" goals: you, the user of Google search are not the first and foremost person they have in mind when designing features. But the advertising company.
In practice that leads to features that are in high demand by these advertisers: an ad being indistinguishable from organic search results. And advertisers being able to tune everything displayed.
Only when the users of the search start walking away (or using adblockers) does it nudge google into the correct tracks.
Google, after all, is not a philantropic developer of a mobile OS, a do-good offering a free tool to search the internet with, nor a friendly volunteer hosting your email. They are, in the end, just another advertising company.

I suggest you read [Susan Blackmore's the Meme machine]( Because it adds another dimension to what you say.
We're only just in the process of replacing one set of memes (religion) for another (capitalism, personal freedom etc). Which is a good thing, if you ask me.
However, seen from memes and gene's point of view, there is no such thing as "free time", it will be occupied in no time by yet another set of memes.
More practically put: You and 5 others barter amongst eachother, leaving you 4 hours of free time a day,: free time. Now, a sixth person who, instead of lying under a palm tree, invests that free time in whatever will benefit him, will have a large advantage over you. Up to the point, that you will either be "forced" to follow, are subjected under that other person, or simply pressed into irrelevance.
This is a well documented and often studied principle: it is the basis of many cultures being annihilated, conquered and enslaved. Those with a more efficient use of their energy will have a benefit over those who do not. Sleeping under a palmtree, is not an efficient use of energy. Obviously, this applies more to entire cultures than to a simgle person living in a jungle, but the principle is clear.
If you see how genes and memes drive our behaviour, form our culture and shape our society, you could turn that around: a person lying under a palmtree is not as efficient in spreading the memes (culture of lying under palmtrees) as someone who, say, spends that time cutting down palmtrees and making ships from that to build a vast trading empire. So, applying basic market-principles (or gene and meme principles) it would not be a surprise to see the "trading empire culture" spread at the cost of the "sleeping under a palmtree culture". 
Edit: I forgot the most important part: Applying that to bitcoin. So what could happen is that either P2P exchage proves more efficient than exchanges through centralized systems. It may be; and if so, certainly something like Bitcoin will spread at the cost of that centralized culture. I have strong hopes that is the case, though it will not be soon. And certainly not lead to more time under a palmtree for everyone. It will, simply put, free some energy to be put into other things. In practice, our society would spend less resources on a central banking system and more on other things.
So, while I really envy you, having a such a wonderful time and great eye-opening experience, I don't see us moving there anywhere soon. And even if we did, it would take one culture of hard working factory-"slaves" to overrule that culture without much effort.
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:50:59


True. In fact, the very proof of this is lying on my windowstill in the sun. Boris, my cat, is the living proof that genes that promote "sleeping for 20+ hours a day" can pay off. In my household, I think Boris is by far the most succesfull organism: he has a whole family of humans catering him.
As I said earlier: these are just examples and so it makes little sense to argue about whether my example and analogies have faults in them: they certainly have, for they are, in the end, just examples and analogies. 
Instead, let's focus on the principle that I try to explain with the examples.


More precise: there will always be turning points; there are always chances for a more efficient use of energy. Which is why we were and will always be in an ever changing environment. Evolution never stops. 
So, true, there will be an equilibrium. My other "pets" are bees. They never sleep at all. Every hour of light with temperatures above 14°C they are flying themselves to a quick death collecting honey. We, humans found our equilibrium for rest somewhere in the middle: we can work more than a cat, but we cannot work as hard as bees. And because our biology found its equilibrium there, we'll "have" to fill it, or else find that other humans who "filled" their time more efficient overruling us.
So, no, I am not saying that it is a race to the bottom (or top). But instead that it is a race to a most efficient use of our energy. 
And if sleeping for 4+ hours under a palmtree proves most efficient, than, yes, we can be sure that evolution will drive us there.

In my country BTC is considered wealth, and taxed as such. Like one would pay tax over owning wealth in the form of an piece of art, money on a savings acct or, indeed a house. That, or I'd have tot pay income- tax when it is converted tot Euros. Which is far more.
I don't mind paying taxes. As I see it as part of my civic duties towards my country, fellow citizens, poor people and so forth. Hence I don't hide them.
So, when buying a house, little would change for me, tax-wise.
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:04:03
No I'm not really entertained. After years, I decided it was a good time to buy a house and pay most of it with "to-be-exchanged" Bitcoin. So I needed to exchange several hundreds of them. Not wanting to dump them on the market all at once and decided to "exchange them slowly", using the withdrawal limit of some exchange as the amount to sell each day.
Worst choice ever. I shoul'dve sold them all at once.
Because, you see, banks (the ones who might finance the rest of that house) don't give a shit about Bitcoin in this. They just want to see Euro's on a European bank account before they beleive the money is really there.
Needless to say, I've slept bad, have no nails left and get up and go to bed with "Bitcoinwisdom" on the screen.
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:00:24
It was just an example, and probably not a very good one, since it leaves out a lot of steps. So, lets take a much smaller step:
Instead of cutting trees, the fifth person could go out and catch more fish.
Four people spend 5 hours fishing. A fifth person spends 10+ hours fishing. All other things equal, the fifth person would catch more than double the amount of fish.
Allowing her, or him, to have a twice as large family. Or give her or him a twice as large chance to survice an accident, storm, sickness and so on.
All these are factors that would enhance spreading the "culture of 10+ hours of fishing a day" over "fishing for 5 hours, then sleep under a palmtree". 
After years, generations or eons, the culture of 10+ hours of work would overrule the culture of sleeping under palmtrees whenever you are done for the day.
I am not saying one is good and another is bad. Genes and memes really don't give a flying f about that: they just "want" to be replicated. And in doing so, spread culture. It is not a case of good vs evil, merely a single explanation of why we are where we are.

As much as I love and beleive in Bitcoin, this seems very irresponsible to me. 
Spread and diversify, always.
And for money that you've classified for "emergencies", you'd better spread it over wealth-holders that are both very stable and allow you to get it out quickly.
At the moment, Bitcoin might be good for the latter, but the faster you can get at it, the more insecure you've stored it, with the current state of the market.
But Bitcoin is certainly not a stable and secure place to store wealth. Its a bumpy rollercoaster ride at best.

I doubt it. Because that would mean you have to buy Bitcoin somewhere every month, and get into the whole "what exchage got hacked this month" lottery.
Just kidding. If you have bicoin, seriously consider telling your emplyees you are willing to pay them in in BTC. There might be one who gets really enthusiastic and you can probably work out a construction that benefits you both.
Edit: I've been adding "you can pay this invoice with xxx bitcoin instead of nnn euro", since 2014. Never did anyone pay me in BTC. I did get a lot p=of chuckles and even a "you really believe in that crap. Sorry, but get out of here". After which I simply added it only to invoices with people I deemed "ready". My goal was not tot get payed in BTC, although I would've welcomed it. But mostly to send a signal that BTC is really worth something towards people who might not understand that simple fact, yet.

Good point. And excellent example with the wolves. 
I am, however, not defending the existence of rules or taxes. I am merely saying that breaking rules is not the best nor the first action to take when one wants to change the rules.
If you want to change them, the democratic route is the first, best and often only one needed, in order to get it changed. Obviously provided you live in a free democratic society in the first place.

If you chose to operate legally, you'll obviously just have to go through all the required procedures, channels and reportings.
Just like I'm a law-abiding citizen and not someone who hides money in Panama; and therefore disclose the worth of the Bitcoin savings on my tax-papers. Sure, technically I could hide it. But that neither feels right to me, nor is it what I expect from others to do: seeing confirmed how the wealty of the earth avoid contributing to the communities they are part of, by avoiding taxes really disgust me.
Same here: you can hide what you are im- and exporting just fine. But when selling, say T-Shirts from China, I think you are undermining all the businesses who *do* pay import taxes or textile-taxes and so on, by operating illegal and not paying these taxes, additions, and so on. 
That, by the way, is not the same as agreeing with these taxes in the first place. But we have democratic means to change that. Most of us do, anyway.

It would be possible. But it is not, ATM. I remember an altcoin that had exactly this: it would share fees amongst all people who help the network, but I cannot find which one that was anymore.
I -personally- think this should be on the roadmap for Bitcoin too: that full nodes are paid as well. But I think running a lightning-network channel is comparable, in very near future: where you can get some small fees by helping route funds through the LN. I would not be suprised to see "turnkey" solutions where you run a full node which also allows opening up such channels with some BTC locked up in there, and which allows you to make a few bucks off the payments being routed through you.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:27:35
A (full) node checks that miners did the right thing, checks and routes transactions and allows clients to read blockchain data. All of which is important. 
Running a node also gives you the power to "vote" for features: by running certain software, enabling or disabling features, you "cast a vote" for or against that feature.
Running a node, however, costs bandwidth and disk-space. I'm running a node on a Linode machine which was underused but needed 24/7 uptime. I'd have to look  into the exact figures, but I don't have to pay extra for BW, disckpace or CPU. 
I was already running this machine, and the machine comes with free base-load, base-space and base-bandwith. The Node does not (yet) use resources outside of those "free" basics. So running it is free.

Untill it *actually scales to that* you should refrain from statements as "will scale". You don't know. It *can theroretically scale* to that amount.
You know what? We have a postgres database backing our payment system (nothing crypto, just one of many payment apps out there) that handles approx the BTC amount on busy days. It can theoretically scale to 20x Bitcoin if we scale the PG RDS instance on AWS up to the max. 
This, however, is silly and a stupid comparison. We currently don't need that scale. We probably never will (payments are a side-show of our app). 
I could come in here and say that our BravosChain (the internal name for the payment system) handles x times Bitcoin. 
But I don't. Because it is a) irrelevant, b) untrue, because it can only do so in theory and c) comparing apples and tomatoes.

And the question is whether BTC will adopt in time, or whether it will be Flippened out before it does. E.g. a successfull lighning network might make a lot of altcoins that offer similar props (ripple, litecoin) far less interesting. 
Or, if BTC would adopt or even plan to do so, some Proof Of Stake, altcoins such as Peercoin or Dash have served their purpose as a fantastic test-bed but loose most of their benefits over BTC. 
BCC is, IMHO far too similar to Bitcoin to be of any real value. The very fact that r/BTC did not move their assets and mining to Litecoin but instead forked, proves -to me- that this is just a scheme by Roger Ver to keep benefitting from his ASIC miners.

Another company putting their weight into the "bitcoin is not a good payment system"-scale.
A pity, IMO. Bitcoin could be a wonderfull payment system, but I'm quite certain that the current price (bubble?) is purely fueled by people who see absolutely nothing in Bitcoin as a Technology/Disruptor/Platform, but purely as "some magic thing to get rich": The Greater Fool Theory. Very much akin to tulip bulbs, IMO. 
Looks like Bitcoin went from "Magic Internet Money" to "Magic Rich Make Thing" very quickly.
Makes me wonder: how much of the transactions -the primary drive for increased fees- are related to exchanges and investments as opposed to people buying stuff with it? Would that be measurable?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:29:59
Correct. Three reasons why:
* A bubble-pop is inevitable. How far it goes down depends on how much "real economy" there is; the amount of investments in hardware, people, knowledge, companies is what gives a base value.
* Something that only grows your value because The Next Fool will get on board is a ponzi and a pyramid. If we stop using BTC for anything but "investing" it does become a pyramid scheme.
* Every actual change that Bitcoin makes in the real world gives it value. Solid, non-volatile, actual value. Every news-item about how bitcoin made FooBar a millionaire moves it towards a tulip-mania. Every news-item about how Bitcoin/blockchain replaced some central, corrupt or outdated system is a win. For society, and for the price in the long run.

When you pose a statement that it “is unlikely to change in 2018” you are doing exactly what the original quote warns against.
First: it is very likely to change, because the change is happening this week. Fees are going down (slightly ), segwit is being used increasingly, amount of transactions per block are increasing already. Lightning is being used on mainnet, etc. 2017 is the year change is implemented. 2018 is the year where well see if it works.
Second: you don't give any background or technical reasoning, just a oneliner which, at most, is an exaggeration, at worst an actual lie, to push some  agenda.

Interesting find. 
From the whitepaper:


hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the
block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.
I've tried to [search for the implementation]( to check how it is implemented. I know that quite some details are only available in the core implementation and not the whitepaper, which makes developing other clients really hard. But where is the logic located that verifies the nonce and resulting hash against the difficulty?

One does not "fix the fees". Even if that would be possible, it would be "fixing the symptom". And this is an Open Source project. There is no "they".
The fees are a symptom of several things:
* Large amounts of transactions. Only Ethereum handles more transactions than Bitcoin. And it's fees are also high (but not near Bitcoins'). Any Altcoin can come back when they *actualy* handle the volume *and* transaction amount that Bitcoin handles.
* There is technology ready, tested and proved. You, me, us, (and not "they") are rolling this out as we speak. *if* this (lighning network) works, and *if* it fullfills its promise, then fees on the main chain will go down, *and* you and I don't need to pay fees at all anymore.

Good advise. And I would want to add that you should consider "testing" the entire process of getting Lira out, at least once. That way you can be reasonably sure that you can exchange Bitcoin in case of emergency (or in case you need or want Lira).
Things to consider: 
* Do I have the tools to import a wallet in cold storage. I, for example, have stored my wallets, on paper, in a hired safe somewhere. I had to test if I could successfully extract the BTC from such a wallet before putting all my BTC into such wallets.
* Can you get to an exchange that will not just convert BTC to lira, but will also ensure payout in reasonable time? If not, you should be aware of the delay, or choose a different route, such as localbitcoin or another exchange buro.
* When going through the entire process: how much fees and other losses are made on the route? Some exchanges, in the end, will wire the Lira to you with international bank transfers, while, on top, taking their own fee. If you are unlucky, you might loose a few tens of dollars along the route.
TL;DR: Don't just worry about getting BTC for Lira, but know and test your options for getting Lira from BTC, in case of emergency.

@_date: 2016-03-03 15:29:24


Is that always so? I know it is 11:48 now, I know a block went through 8 minutes ago, so I can be reasonably sure*) the next block will be found at 11:50. 
I can find out how much transactions are enqueued and what their fees are. So I could be quite certain that if I add a fee that higher then the enqueued transaction with the highest fee currently in line, my transaction will get through somewhere between now (in the block to be found at 11:50) or in the block after that (12:00). In other words: when I add a fee of 2BTC, I'm quite certain my transaction will be handled extraordinarily quick, not?
I could also say that when my fee is very low average, it will be near the end of the queue. So I could look at all the transactions and how many are probably going into the future blocks, and see where mine comes in line. If that is five blocks ahead, I know that with the *current state of the transactions in queue, and their fees* mine is to be handled somewhere coming hour.
And probably find a line for all the fees inbetween that. 
Or am I missing something crucial, here?
*) We're speaking statistically, not mathematically here, obvious. I know there is a mathematical chance that no block goes through in the next few days or weeks, even. Yet, statistically I'm reasonably certain that one will go through every 10 minutes.

I dislike this particular UX (too cluttered), but agree with what it tries to achieve: to allow people to make an informed choice.
What about:
    Fee:
    [----||----------] [0.0005] BTC
    Estimated to be processed at 12:05 today
When you drag the slider (or change the amount in the field), the fee amount is adjusted and a new estimation is calculated.
Now, I have no idea how to calculate such an estimation or if it is possible at all. But these two data-points are the only variables that will interest a user: how much they have to pay in order to get the transaction through before T.

To me, Bitcoin is the second Anarchist project that really took off. 
I hate it when all that it gets "out there" is those bragging *look how rich I got* things. Especially since the media picks this up most.
Bitcoin is about changing the world. About new frontiers. 
The settlers in the US, pushing the frontiers are not remembered for their wealth, are they? But for how they escaped a broken world order, prosecution and oppression in Europe[1]. And how they sought and found freedom, space, equality, opportunities. This is what Bitcoin is about. Not about that one settler in the wild west buying a silly yellow carriage with five horses.

USD is more sought after, but hard to get. BTC is available, but has low demand. And everyone wants to get rid of the crashing currency. By that logic, people will want to buy USD. But would buy BTC instead, untill USD comes available for them.

When it goes down, off course.
But, seriously. You only know it *went* down, not that it is *going to*. Not without time travel.
There are some tricks to predict a downwards trend. They are complex, often wrong and as such, offer no guarantees. Look into MACD and Triangular Patterns for the two most basic prediction methods. But, again, they are nothing certain. Never buy or sell what you cannot afford to loose!
Edit: my trading strategy is: don't try to go for The Highest Win, just settle for a Good Win. E.g when you like the profit. When you try to get the highest possible profit, that comes with the increased chance of loss as well.

Back when btc was about $10, I lost 5btc because I reset my laptop and realised too late that I had some spending-money on that drive. I did have backups but lost the encryption-keys. Well, pity.
Backups are important. Being able to restore them even more so. 
When your wealth grows above what you consider A Large Amount, I'd suggest to move your walkers to paper, or usb-drives (or both) and backup these to several secure places: your parents' vault, a vault at your local bank or jeweler, in a wall, whatever. But be certain to be able to restore them. Practice that. If possible each year or so.

I  like the idea of a secure, self-hosted, "savings account". 
Sure, a paper wallet is a good place, but you can extract it at any time: i'ts just somewhat cumbersome (and probably slow, since you first need to get the paper wallets out of the safe, physically). 
One thing I always liked about my (main) savings account, is that the Bank gives some guarantees that I cannot spend the money earlier.
Making such a "future wallet", possibly entirely self-contained[1] would be a very nice gift and would be a valuable item to enforce yourself to hodl.
-- 
[1] with that, I mean e.g. a USB drive that has the wallet, instructions on how to use it, and possibly even a runnable executable to open that wallet. This way, you could give your new-born niece "one BTC" on her birth, only spendable on her 16th birthday. With the only risk of BTC going away entirely. But otherwise, in 16 years, the thumb-drive should be somewhat runnable and executable, still.

There are several reasons why you'll find quite some differences between exchanges:
* Subsidy through zero fees, or other cost-reductions: in order to grow customer-basis, some exchanges pour money into their platform causing it to be very cheap. When you remove a 1% fee on each order, they tend to close at about 1% higher. Also, these platforms tend to follow other exchanges more then that they are the actual leaders. e.g. Huobi has a rediculous amount of tiny orders (compared to e.g. kraken or bitstamp).
* High friction of getting money in. When it takes days (or hours) to get Fiat in, buy's will lag a little. Currently there's an influx of new traders. They need to get their money on the platforms before they can start buying. When this takes days, it'll be jan 3 before the large orders start running. These will generally trade lower first, then catch up and spike higher too.
* When it takes time, or require high fees to get fiat out: people will -generally- avoid such platforms for trading BTC-&gt;fiat. An exchange leaning to one-side will have a different price, generally BTC will be cheaper and fiat more expensive.
Disclaimer: I am not an expert, just a hobby-trader; hodler mostly though.

Certainly. Pointing out potential disasters is always good.
But, in your analogy, it would be better if there's an AED on board so everyone can be saved. And the bus company provides a solution so everyone can continue the ride home safely. Not just those two passengers who happen to have tickets for alternative bus-companies. 
What strikes me, to continue your analogy, is that people who are holding tickets for alternative bus-companies, are actually *hoping* for a heart attack or two, with lots of casualties, because that'll drive up the price of their tickets. This is what I despise. Sure, this is capitalism, so making money over others' deaths or downfall is fine (-ish) but when other peoples (or entire countries') downfall becomes the only way to make money, you are running a horrible enterprise.

Someone needs to pay the onchain fees when you withdraw from an exchange.
It makes sense that this exchange either proxies that fee 1:1 through to all the withdrawers, or demand maintains some average fee with which they can cover the periods when fees are high. Binance does the latter, but the fee is very high, compared to e.g. kraken or other exchanges.

Or you re-use an old one, copy-paste the wrong one, etc. Crappy UX is still quite common in the realm of wallets. So choosing a previous used address is not always very clear. "Was that the 'kraken_03' from where I sent the BTC to my wallet, or that I used to send the BTC to the exchange? Seriously: that question is nearly impossible to answer within several of the wallets I use. 
Addresses are hard to read[1] and type. Typo's, however, are not the problem. Because they are so hard to type, you need a manager for addresses, or at least some solid copy-paste system. No-one is going to type over an address displayed on a desktop screen onto his mobile. That is just too error prone (which, again, in itself is the not the issue, because of checksums), but require again other software, like QR-code generators, -readers, "share-clipboard-between-mobile-and-desktop" etc. 
TL;DR: UX of many clients, wallets, exchanges suck. Combined with it being practically impossibile to type over an anddress makes is enough ingredient to "get it wrong".

edit: [1] The thing I tought myself WRT shasums, addresses, pub/priv keys and so on, is to first read the first 4 and last 4 characters. Then compare that. If they match, read a larger part. Depending on the stakes, reading 8-first, 8 lasts most often suffices.

You don't need the same security when buying a can of beer or buying a house.

I had this discussion with some colleagues the other day.
I've spend over 300 BTC buying stuff (I'm not into drugs, so yes, ordinary, legal stuff, like beekeepers-equipment, beer, a wallet, hardware, pizza's and so on) with it. 
They were like "You have been stupid", you could've had even more tons of €s now, if you had kept them.


It matters little what it is spend on, be it drugs, beekeeper-equipment, pizza's or other (crypto)currencies: the point is that the only thing that will make a price go up, is if more people believe it has a value. A stolen leonardo-da-vinci painting, one that no-one, not even other criminals will want to buy, is essentially worthless. A crypto-currency that cannot be spent on anything, not now, not in the future, is worthless too.
TL;DR People buying stuff (or other currencies on markets) with BTC are the ones giving it value.

At least it is becoming one quickly. 
As long as the real-world usage follows the same trend as it's price, it is "just" a currency, store of wealth, etc. 
Right now, this is becoming less and less the case. 
So, either a very big correction would solve this, or it becomes an actual ponzy, in the sense that it turns into a commodity that is rare and will only increase in price if more people get in. And in order to make it increase in price, more people need to get in.
As opposed to "it increases in price because it's use cases, usage, investments increase".

You are being obnoxious. 
When I say to my mother "sure, I'll pay you back as soon as I'm at home", we don't need a cryptographically, mathematically proven smart contract to enforce that.
Security is very much dependent on context.
A shop owner who sells $20 per day in BTC transactions might be happy enough with 1/100 being double spended. Someone selling yachts probably not.
Someone going through the process of building a fake BTC app, just to get *one* coffee for free is just stupid. Someone building such an app to fake the payment for his yaght, not so.
You don't make fake €0.01 coins. The effort is never going to pay off. That is why a €500 bill is much better secured than a €0.01 coin.

Raises hand. Though actually in €. 
I'm happy I had BTC on my balance for the taxes ever since 2012. I've paid into thousands of €s tax, for not hiding my BTC from them. Hiding would have been easy though: as simple as not telling.
However, I don't mind paying taxes that much, because I see it as my contribution to the funds we as a community need to do things for ourselves, as a community. (Note that this is not the same as paying as much taxes as I want, nor that this means I won't try to pay as little as legally possible).
The other good thing, is that now that I am extracting part of that money (to buy a house) I don't have to explain where the money comes from. 
Or, actually, I had to explain it to the notary (some laundering-law) and simply offering my relevant tax-papers was enough.
Last positive thing, is that in our local tax laws, BTC wealth is taxed as wealth (like an expensive piece of art would be) which is taxed relatively heavily (yea, communist europe :)). However, the alternative would have been to put it in the papers as "income from X", which would not have been entirely correct in the first place (but probably explainable), yet taxed even more. Up to 60% or so I was told. 
Which means I woul'dve payed more than the amount my house cost to the taxes. Now, that is something I *dont* like.

More general: people are using different clients and wallets. 
* Mobile clients/wallets: are only connected when requested, to save battery and such.
* Offline clients and wallets: coins, cards, prints, encrypted thumbdrives, dedicated netbooks: anything that is only connected to the network on rare occasions; e.g. to cash or move the coins.
* Webbased wallets: depending on their technical implementation, possibly only connect trough proxies as one client.

Nope. Speaking for my own country Netherlands, where absolutely everything is done via a bank and cache is becoming rare: not true. 
For example an NGO, "dagloon" offering jobs for a day, for homeless and addicted and other problematic people, pays in cache. All taxes are deducted before you get the money handed. This NGO is the one paying the taxes in this case.
Having worked for an NGO in a poorer region in South Africa in my past, I can tell you this is administration, deducting tax before handing out the payments, is done on large scale too.

Tor offers Anonymity. Simply hiding your IP address is not anonimity; for example, one can easily identify persons trough profiling. Age, interests, travel behaviour, dayly schedule/sleepytime all sum up to uniquely identifiable people. They might not have an exact name, then, but our fingerprints identify me and you uniquely enough, that a name matters little. Whether your name is 362e09007ec7d7cfd237da46add11a44b0c42e9a, or Danny Kreutzfelt matters nothing.
Tors features are (amongst others): 
* Hidden services
* Trafficnoise: noise of other people using the network drowns your traffic
* Stripping packages off identification
* Stripping parameters (referers, query strings, spy-cookies) away
* And many more.
But the most important "feat" is security. Hiding your IP is as simple as logging in trough you neigbours modem. But how can I know that my neighbor is not running firesheep, or injecting MITM-pages between me and my online bank? Tor ensures that, trough their architecture; mainly connecting over a proxy (such as your neighbour), again, is not a way to gain privacy; on contrary. It is fairly probable that you are less secure andleaking more information then if you connect from home using your own connection. If you are monitored, it is far easier for me to listen in on you, when you are buying BitCoins from the local starbucks, then when you do so trough your ISP.

I think micropayments is the simplest and most local first step. Because it allows Brave to spread quite nicely. Imagine a random blogger getting a mail "You can collect $10.23, here is how" after a month. E.g. Reddit might not be bothered, but some small blogger might see a nice addition here. 
But I see a lot of other opportunities. Like a the free service only enabling more resources after a certain amount of "donations" are in. Imagine an image-hoster, project management tool or bitcoin-chart site offering 100 new signups for every dollar they receive through this channel. Or a video site could show advertisements unless it has recieved enough to cover the monthly bandwith fees. And so on.
Or like you suggest, a site sending a header then having the browser pay automatically (obvious with notifications, probably similar to how a browser asks to shaer your location or access your microphone) to access content. 
You could continue down that road, and think about captcha's that require you to may microscopic amounts to access a resource. Or webshops that simply ask your browser to pay instead of relying on third party and wonky integrations of PSPs.

You, and the commentors above you, gave the advise to use a liveCD in a café. That is not only a bad advice, because it is a very poor measure to hide ones privacy no matter where you live. 
It most off all, assumes, that anyone wanting to protect their privacy, lives in a place where cafés are plenty, not monitored and accessible in the first place. Even in "first world" cities such as Paris, one cannot surf anonymous from cafés without taking extensive measures beyond a simple LiveCD. Let alone if you are, say, an activist in the Niger delta, or a protester in Iran or Syria.
Neglegting to see that, is what I call "demographically small minded"; failing to see that not everyone is a citizen of a large U.S. City; for example.

«We're sorry, but something went wrong. We've been notified about this issue and we'll take a look at it shortly.» is the default error for applications built with Rails; when something goes booboo at the backend. (error 500)
The fact that they roll out a Rails app is not bad nor good. But the fact that they didn't change the default errors smells bad. 
The fact that they obviously have no monitoring on their logs to pick up these errors is worse. 
and the fact that these errors turn up on production on a default action shows that they did not test properly.

Yes and no.
Yes, because if we were to move all payments (and deposits, topups etc) onto a ln today, fees would go down towards zero. (Note that fees are back to below $1 already, today). So this would take away thousands of dollars per block, from a market that operates on extremely narrow marges already.
No, because it opens up bitcoin to extreme growth. If this growth, which is now possible, actually happens, the application layer will still be very busy. Imagine bitcoin as a ledger to just manage millions upon millions of channels.

Bitcoin society has suffered far too much blows from companies who we should have been much more wary about; wary about things like how they had their security and backups organised, for example. 
Making sure that the people behind some bitcoin tool are the ones they say they are, as well as that they and their product is trustworthy is our sacred tasks as members of the bitcoin community. To make it better and stronger. And to weed out the bad ones.

Unless this is simply the next hype-cycle, in wich we will see a bubble, see it crashing and then stabilising, most probably, a little higher then the last $4.x "stable" price. Probably $5.x?
I am pretty sure that in the coming years the BTC-value will mostly be a double sinus on a slight slope. The long term is the slope: it will rise, but slowly; driven up by the amount of investment people do in the BTC-economy at large. The two sinuses on top are: hype-cycles: bubbles driving up, bursting and then crashing. 
With a smaller sinus on top of that being the fluctuating price influenced by day-trading and large buy- and sells.
Obviously the sinuses are not perfect. And possibly the slope is logarithmic, or possibly a slope of an even large sinus.

Then you don't need a blockchain. What you want is a P2P database. Such as Couchdb. Unless the "posts" are things that can be moved from owner-to-owner and never copied or double-spent. In which case "erasing" makes no sense. 
A Blockchain is not some internet-snakeoil, to solve all your IT-problems and to be thrown at every problem. A blockchain is an extremely inefficient and very cumbersome pattern. 
This inneficiency is required for it to solve the decentralised trust problem. And for it to be open and accessable-to-everyone (free) it needs cumbersome bootrstrapping and connection protocols.

It touches Bitcoin, because after this precedent, you can no longer hide your wallets from your government, if they have reasons to see it. 
Your government can see into your bankacct, creditcard spending and so on. BTC is a potential (and possibly already actual working) solution to this: governments and corporations can only see money going around to and fro wallets. If you take good measures, the money is very hard to pin down to you.

Sure, Electron is a poor replacement for native development.
But for bootstrapping something like this Lightning Network it is actually a very viable technology. 
1. It allows the developers to focus on the Value Proposition: rather than spending time on buttons, layouts and so on, they can focus on implementing the lightning network stuff. The stuff that matters.
1. It lowers the barrier to entry a lot. Anyone with some CSS and HTML skills can chime in and help out.
1. You know how crappy the Bitcoin-Core UI looks, how clunky even electrum is? They use some native-ish (QT, IIRC) cross-platform-thing. And I still cannot run it on my iPad or Android Phone. 
1. Any native development requires you to spend time on specific platforms. Even something like QT requires you to spend time in order to get that darned "save backup dialog" to work on Puppy Linux 1337, or to fix that stupid performance issue on OSX-captain-underpants. (aka: leaky abstractions). At this stage you don't want to spend that effort on those areas.

Sorry for being concice and thius incomplete. This is reddit. Missing all the details and such.


And what is driving consumtion? Investments? (yes, for a small part)
Mostly, consumption is driven by need. For the sake of the argument, lets ignore the huge portion of consumption driven by markenting. 
We need cars. We need computers, iphones, wine, water, sheep, bricks. People invest in a brick-factory because of "the demand for bricks". 
And we buy bricks because we need houses? And why do we need them? Because living under a bridge, or with your mom sucks (pun not intended). We buy a house because we need to. House-buying is not driven by the decreasing value of a savings account. It is driven by the need for a roof. (edit: the rest is what we call a housing bubble)
I'm simply trying to explain that the silly investment-inflation combination is based on a lot of presumptions  that are only true because of that same investment-inflation combination presumption.

This is not a bad thing, nor a good thing. It is merely one of the many things people "investing" need to pay attention to.

Correct. 
Currently investors do the same: "store it on some saving acct or invest it" a simple calculation.
When, for some reason, interest on savings are higher than a calculated^* ROI, people keep it there. Otherwise they invest it. 
Nothing new here.
My figures were purely fictional and only meant to illustrate that saying "inflation is good because it pushes people to invest" is incomplete, undecided and overall unscientifical. 
You simply don't know. All you have is "gut feelings". Fine. But then don't present them as facts.
*1 which means, in pure, secure, economical terms: investment minus insurance = ROI.

You are right. And I've played with colored coins, scripts and such myself.  So I have been using those application layers myself already. I even made a beercoin, which allowed me to send an 'I owe you a beer' there.
But those were always additions to bitcoin. Making it do stuff that was hard in Core, for example.
With ln, we're moving a core part, payments, out of Bitcoin core (well, not moving, but copying, really) into another layer. Which is much more significant since it turns a key feature of bitcoin into a layered architecture.
But you are right. I should've pointed out more clearly that this has been possible all along. Though without segwit, my beercoin wasn't a very secure one....

That is only true if the deflationary increase of value is bigger than the increase of value through return on investment.
When that business can choose between hodling and gaining, say 4% through deflation or investing and gaining 5% roi it will choose the latter. 
I'm only saying it is not as black-white.
We actually have proof currently: When I hodl my €3000 that I earned, in a year that is worth €2925 because of 2.5% inflation. 
But, when I decide to spend it now, on goods that keep their value, say, two very good chairs, I have €2625 worth in "chairs". I've essentially lost €300 over hodling?
Why? Because of VAT (I used 12.5%, in EU it is more like 21%). VAT is a tax that actually punishes people spending instead of hodling. Yet, we still spend. 
Why? Because we need to. We need chairs, iphones, pizzas, beans, cars. WE don't buy a car "because of inflation", we buy cars because we need to get from A to B and walking or cycling is too far.

If the application layer uses the bitcoin blockchain, it will reconcile there.
Even if most applications only use it to store state once in a while, it means a lot of transactions go through it. Bitcoin, the currency,  could then become nothing more than a value to attach to transactions: used primarily for fees, so to say. Similar to what ether is, in a way.
What that will do to the price? No idea, but worth exploring, I guess.

78%of all percentages mentioned on Reddit are entirely made up.
That said, investment is an important part of our current economic model. But, like the other 136 important parts (number entirely made up), it is both not a critical part, and a potential weakest link.
What I'm saying is not that you are wrong, but that it's not that absolute at all, either. There are plenty of economies, communities and eras where things run or ran just fine without any ROI on investment. Some of the wealthiest countries have a (religiously imposed... Yuck) ban on interest. Granted, they are wealthy because of oil. But they are also a living proof that an economy can run just fine without a ROI/ interest.
It might just be perfectly fine to bend our economy into one where investment requires other incentives than "hodling costs money". 
It might not. It might kill our economy. We don't know. 
And we certainly don't know employment rates that go with those predictions.

Interesting thought.  Lightning is, indeed pushed, built and conceptualized by a company.
But I disagree on your conclusion : the result is not centralized into that company. They don't force traffic through them, the design and implementation is open source. There are already clients, like the android wallet one that I linked, that are built outside of blockstream.
Ln *might* very well centralize, as it has a built in tendency to gravitate towards certain nodes. But then it'll gravitate towards the parties that handle most payments, not towards the company that invented it.

With current banking systems, this is even worse. 
Take, for example [PSD2]( 
Anne wants privacy. She has idealogical problems with "Easy Mostgage®" and chooses another mortgage for the reasons that they require full access to your payment history through PSD2.
But Bob chooses to hand over some private information for additional service. Bob decides he lets "Easy Mostgage®" have full access to his payment history in order to simplify his mortgage application and maybe get some discounts even. 
Now, unrelated, Bob pays Anne for some service. And Anne pays bob back what she owes him from that binge-drinking weekend. 
Easy Mostgage® now sees pieces of Anne's payment history even if Anne never gave them access! Easy Mostgage® now knows that Anne and Bob do business together, have a private relation of some sort. And they know that Anne goes on binge-drinking weekends, despite her explicitly choosing not to give this data to Easy Mostgage®.
The exact same issues occur when Anne is a fine citizen, but Bob's payment history is monitored by the Drug Police; and Anne and Bob have some unrelated payments. Simply because there are always at least two parties involved in a transaction, yet you want to monitor only one party.
This problem with surveillance something that Bitcoin solves a little, but which layers like Lightning or blockchain set-ups like Monero solve in much more solid ways even. By allowing any such second party to remain anonymous by default.

Oh, I agree. And frankly, that is the main and most important role I see for altcoins today.
However, PeerCoin has been runnning PoS for years now and so far has not been abused. And with a market Cap of $87.740.834, there is quite some bounty tho "hack the crap out of it". 87 million dollars are protected by PoS at this very moment. So it might just work.

Miners are Bitcoin too, they are not some entity outside of Bitcoin. A miner *is* bitcoin, just like someone HODLING on Kraken *is* bitcoin. So Bitcoin will move towards where the entire community thinks it should move. A lot of people tend to see Miners as some Evil External Threat. A miner has just as much at stake as someone HODLing or as someone accepting BTC at her shop. 
Then, within that community, misalignments, or even conflicting interests may (will) occur. 
Volatility is good for daytraders. But in direct conflict with the interests of someone selling Alpaca Socks for BTC.  
Proof Of Stake is good for new miners, since those don't a Chinese Govt Sponsoring our elecriticity to break even. But in direct conflict with the interests of someone who bought a datacenter full of ASICs.
I could go on. 
My point is: conflicting intesterests are there, not just miners. When consensus is reached, or some game-theory or economic incentives moves it in a certain direction, that is where it will go.
If ETH runs on PoS, and *if* it actually works, and *if* it does not open up a whole new pandora's-box, ETH has a huge leverage over BTC. It suddenly does not have to (quite literally) burn $101.800.000,00 electricity per day[1], but instead can use that 100-million dollar to build cool stuff; to invest in making ETH better. 100-million investment potential. Per Day[2]
Or, the other way around: BTC has a disadvantage of 101Million, per day over ETH at that moment. This here is a huge economic incentive to move. To catch up. Or to die. If a conflict within a community is unresolvable, then, yes, there is an actual chance that the entire community dies. But the incentives to move are huge, so the chance is that something will move when the time is right: when the sum of conflicting vectors move slightly, the community will move.
[1] This is simplified, napkin-math, but it works out: the total costs of the entire Mining Thing will equalize around the total payout for all blocks. If blocks pay out more than the total costs, there is a gap that can be filled by new miners. If it is less, miners will drop out.
[2] Yes, I am deliberately simplifiing stuff. And ignoring a lot. PoS is not free either. So let's assume some "mining scheme" that does not involve "burning money", but instead allows re-investing the Proof, let's call this Proof of Investment (PoI): this has a huge advantage over a coin that requires literally burning that money.

Allthough the comments over there are mostly by "iampaul" I think he summarizes the general mood pretty well: "There is uncertainty, we have some doubt on particulars, hence we should fear it" AKA FUD. 
There are some valid points, but for now it is that mantra all over again "unequal distribution! is it legal? but how can we control it? nobody uses it, so it will fail".
Maybe it is too soon yet. But maybe the KIVA model is not fit for BTC as a means alltogether.
For now, I see their biggest opportunity in money-transfers between KIVA and the MFIs. But then these MFIs will get "stuck" with all the BTC. Since they must most probably pay out the loans in local currency. So eventhough the transfer of the money from KIVA to the MFI will in many countries be a lot easier and cheaper then now, transferring fom BTC to local currencies are going to be harder.
OTOH: Paypal refuses to deal with certain countries, because of US embargo's. Does that mean KIVA does not deal with these countries too? Does paypal even hold a finger in the aid pie?

ETH has some marvelous things ahead. Sharding is one, proof of stake another.
But, like with all open source, nothing stops bitcoin from implementing good ideas that have been proven in altcoins. Nothing fundamental stops bitcoin from moving to a PoS or implement sharding when blockchains data structures grow too large. In fact, I'm quite certain that PoS has such a big economic benefit, that it will become one of the big natural selection criteria. If it actually works. No system can uphold wasting of resources, if competing systems don't waste it, but use the resources to gain ground.

In addion, it changes the window of attack from "always" to "only when you are using the bitcoin program". 
It, for example, will allow you to take measures before (and after) you do your daily bitcoin-administration, such as killing deamons, erect a more sturdy firewall and so forth, or switch to a clean, separated user-account. 
When bitcoin is not running, the wallet will be inaccessible.

While I understand that this is a perfect model for a smallscale business, It turns out that it is not such a thing for largescale practice. 
Don't get me wrong. I roll out ecommerce shops in less then a week for clients.  But those are not the ones that hold values of multimillions of dollars, goods and orders. 
We, the BTC economy, are running on such smallscale, quickly setup ventures, but are putting literally tens of millions of value in those ventures. Which simply does not fit. As we have learned the hard way.
Selling 10 socks per week over the internet is fine on a shop hacked together from OS-commerce tools. Selling hundreds of millions of dollars, vouchers and other stuff per week is NOT fine. That requires FAR, FAR more then just a few scripts. Especially on the none-software side. 
Just one simple thought that will take months to sort out: How to deal with my local taxlaws when I run a BTC-bank, where clients store a total of 2mln US$. One has to sort that out, BEFORE the tax-collector desides you ought to have payed a lot more over your liquidities and decides to pull the server out of the datacenter and confiscates all your client's money. To get something this simple sorted, legalised, contracted and stamped by all officials usually takes months. Right now most ventures don't sort out these things, or sort them out later. Which, as we have learned the hard way, is simply stupid, and most of all unprofessional.
And that is just one thought of hundreds you will have to sort out, before going live and earning the trust of your clients or putting the entire BTC economy in danger.
TL;DR: sorting out all the legal stuff that might, will or can bring you and your clients with you down, that will harm the BTC economy, takes time in a world where legal and administrative stuff goes really slow.

I am not familiar with Asia or South-America, but know from personal experience and from documentation that many african communities have several successfull currency-alternatives. 
1. Cellphone credits. Since the credits are stored in a "secret" code to unlock that credit, this number can be sent around easily. And verified easily. People do actuall pay with this secret code a lot. Especially in western Africa.
2. Dollars and Euro's. In many countries with high inflation, or with high access-barriers to local currency, dollars are the "unit" to store larger amounts of value in. Day-to-day trade still takes place in local currency, but large transactions all done in Dollars or Euros.
3. Candy. Yes. In Zimbabwe lollipops are an actual store of value, used for small amounts of change. 
4. Land-ownership-certificates. In quite a few countries people have no access to savings of any kind. Traditionally land and cattle have been a measure of wealth in most southern and eastern African cultures. As such the legal system around that ownership is more accessible to people. And that makes this a good investment as savings. In South-Africa it is very common to pay a dowry of X-cows, usually translated directly into money. People all seem to know the cow-Rand exchangerate by heart. 
Obviously the western world has alternative currencies and value holders as well. But ours are a lot less common and nearly always directly translated into money. African cultures have a lot less history with these monetary systems and apparently use alternative systems a lot more then we do. 
Their transition into any crypto-currency will be a lot less hard then ours. 
TL;DR: African cultures already use alternative currencies in day-to-day life. Their transition will be a lot simpler then ours. AKA: [Law of the handicap of a head start](

As far as I know, the application will need to keep an unencrypted copy somewhere when running: how else can it read the original data that it needs to operate? I will probably keep this in RAM, and AFAIK the contents of that are not too hard to read out.

That is my point: Installing Just An Open Source e-commerce package is but a tiny part of the entire "Running a business". how about liquidity? Where to store the goods? How to deal with returns? Did you insure yourself against fire, theft, hacks?

Because I believe that more is better. Choice is good. Currently there is no real choice for the most important asset in our lives (yea, yea, besides love and happyness and health and such): money. 
You can choose your brand of bank, but it is nearly impossible to choose not to use a bank. We need banks: to travel (traintickets, gas-stations all require you to have an ATM-card or, sometimes creditcards here, in Netherlands). 
I don't think this will change soon, but having alternatives that grow and become more and more usefull will at least offer some choice.

That depends on whether the legal system considers bitcoins to have value. If they are illegal in your area, then for sure, stealing it, is illegal, but you were just as illegal. 
In many countries, stealing anything from a computer is considered illegal. 
Bitcoins, a file containing value, is nothing new. I have worked on simulations who's containing knowledge were worth more then most Ferraris are. There is a real illegal network of criminals who steal and sell such corporate files for a lot of money. 
For now, I would consider Bitcoin wallets to be exactly similar to those.

I use and love [Bitcoin Wallet]( If the blockchain is somewhat up to date, you will hear a nice "Ka-ching!"-tiller sound almost instantanious upon sending the money. The message plays on the phone receiving the money. 
But note! You will be storing your wallet on a poorly secured, always-running-around-with, SSD (hardy erasable) device. You should only and only ever store money on your phone that you don't mind losing. Similar to not carrying a couple of hundred Euro's around in your pocket on an average drinking night.

I too suspect that we are pumping far less then $1.5million into the BTC economy. And that this is a very logical reason for the dropping price. As such, your article makes some very interesting points and seems extremely legit. 
It is just that one of the key "facts" misses its foundation. If there is a solid way to make out the amount of $ (or €, £ or ¥) going into the economy, it would improve your points even more. 
If there is no way to get this number, then the article is purely academical. One of its key variables is undefinable, hence the outcome is undefinable.
@_date: 2011-09-07 20:29:10


Then why does the money keep flowing if making transactions is taxed? Taxed by governments (VAT), by Creditcard companies (Fees), Banks (payment-costs) and so on?
To encourage spending money yet punish those hoarding it; the fees, taxes and such should be much lower then the inflation. Which it is not ATM. 
And that does not take into account other actual costs for transporting, securing and printing the actual money. 
To me, a computer programmer with only a few highscool classes in economics, the theory seems entirely flawed, seen in the light of the current practice of taxing and fee-ing transactions.

Certainly. And as a developer at a company who is providing p2p payments to just under a million users, that is exactly what we do.
The problem comes when these users don't trust you and that SQL database. Or when your SQL database and your product is bought. (or hacked, but that is another type of problem).
People need to trust you. Sure. I trust Currence (our local 1Bln payment provider) to handle my ecommerce and pin-transactions just fine. And sure, I trust Venmo for not running off with my money. 
But I don't trust Venmo enough to put 10K in it and leave it there for when I hit 65th birthday. Nor do I trust the SQL database at Apple Pay enough to say: sure, boss, just pay my wages into my apple wallet.
Bitcoin offers a great benefit over your SQL database: the fact it is not *your* SQL database. But that is our (extremely innefficient and CO² blasting) database. That no-one can own. And no-one can deny me access to. Ever.

Yea. To me this sounds like an excuse to run away with a lot of money. The community should place alarmbells all over the place to warn us when one of the bitcoins "lost" re-appears.

"South Korea plans a national digital payment system using an extemely innefficiant and enormously power-consuming system".
I love Bitcoin, and love the concept of Blockchain. But people should realize that it is a very, very (very!) innefficient way to handle money when there is a central authority.
The inneficiency is required to keep it peer-to-peer, without hierarchy and zero-trust. But if you don't need these attributes, you are probably better off hiring tenthousand workers to write the transactions with pencil in paper ledgers. And scan these using self-learning webcams. That is probably faster, uses less energy and cheaper overall.
We need Bitcoin, we need Blockchain. We need it for its zero-trust attribute. You and your payment-company quite certainly don't need a Blockchain.

I understand that you were flamebaiting to get a message out. But I /am/ serious when I say that if you are to do any serious UX work on this, take actual and realistic persona;s. A technically challenged entrepeneur who deals with 20+orders/a day probably needs a more complex interface then a linux application developer ordering a pizza or two a week.
If you go for nerd==many-knobs-and-features VS my_mom==one-button-at-most you get the UX just as wrong (or even more so) then when you just design something for yourself only.
Which is the cause of the UX problems right now. What is being developed is done so to scratch own itches. People develop an interface because they need one. People improve that, because they need an improved one. After a treshold, people rewrite and create interfaces for others then themselves, because there is something to benefit from "out there". Clearly that last treshold is being reached now. 
But seriously, my_mom does not need any BTC interface yet, so don't invent one for her. ThatWindowsUsingStockTrader, and the_interested_journalist however, do need one. Make it for them!

To be even more pedantic: it is not your property unless you have truly unlimited and irrevocable access to it.
Money might very well be a simple means to get wealth from A to B. Especially for small amounts of wealth. 
Money, in the end, is a simple way to pay for a can of beer. A p2p, decentralized, irrevocable access to a proof of ownership of wealth is very important. But a lot less important when simply paying your glass of IPA[1].
[1] However, when you are the receiving end of the payments, the equivalent of a thousand single cans of beer, amounts to a wealth. So, maybe, even for average small amounts, having it in a non-political, zero-trust environment might be an important thing!

That is true for a lot of businesses, but not the example you give. Generally we will pay the sandwitch after consuming it. But places like sandwitchbars could charge right after purchace. Which gives the merchant the time you spend eating the sandwich and drinking the coffee to have the transaction verified.

Maybe this is true for a few informed individuals in the BTC community, but certainly not everyone. 
When I (and with me 99%) buy something off ebay, we don't evaluate the price against the current USD/Yen/Pound/Eur exchange rates, albeit we probably buy from there. We simply pay the price as advertised.

You may want to look at  a Dutch/English service that markets energy.
For example Greenhousefarmers can sell the electrical power from their CHP when the price is good, or use it themselves when the price is bad. 
Companies with high energy demand (such as metal-cutters) can buy energy when it is cheap.
With BTC you can easily use their services: monitor the price of energy, when the price is low, fire up the miners and hash away. When the price rises above certain tresholds, you shut the miners down. 
Another great model would be to generate your own energy, e.g. with a windmill or solar panels (in the .eu often heavily subsidised by the way). When the price on the APX is higher then the gain from mining, you sell your electrcity to the APX, but when the price is low, you convert your power into BTC trough the miners. 
In addition, one would probably want to store the generated heat via a heatpump in the ground or in water. So as to re-use that heat in wintertime.

Building a serious and professional e-commerce venture is hard. It takes you somewhere between 5 months to a year to get from idea to market. 
Don't forget that. 
While we are all whining about BTC not being professional and stuff, professionals are in the process of building ventures around Bitcoin. 
While lots and lots of quickly thrown together os-commerce, or even crappier attic-built-phpscripts are released as "ventures". Building a professional venture takes time: requires far more then reading a book on Rails, or installing the first Open Source Webshop App: it requires a good businessplan, lawyers, insurances, deals with shipping agencies, well-thought-out policies and helpdesks, secure (physical) storage facilites. And so on. 
The ventures that are running now are most of all lacking any professionalism: which is the reason why they are up there, stealing our money, or having it stolen. They rightfully don't deserve our trust. 
Setting up a bank, requires years of preparation and involvement of various professionals. Just the average process to get licenced and scanned (so as to e.g. prove your customers you are who you say you are) alone often takes weeks or even months. 
Give it some time. The professional ventures are working on products for the BTC economy. But because of their professionalism, the first will only release probably in the fall of this year. 
TL;DR: Professional (BTC) ventures take a lot of time bbefore they are released right, solid and trustworthy. They are simply not yet here because of the young age of BTC. Be patient.

It is a rails application, which does not mean that it is clean or rubbish in any way. But at least it makes looking at it, quite easy; Rails apps are built in a very standardised and structured way.
They would also not release the code if they knew for sure that within ten minutes developers would shout "you see, they are rubbish, a 10-year-old-cat would have done better at coding". They must be confident, which makes parts such as the interfacing to the bitcoin blockchaing really interesting to be re-used or at least evaluated for the ideas, for future projects in rails.

Yup. If increasing block-size is the solution, it has to go hand-in-hand with plans to distribute the storage.

When you see Google Search as a large advertising platform, a place where you, the site owner, put up tiny entries that make people aware of your site, through SEO, then sure, this quote makes no sense.
But when you see Google search as a revenue making platform in itself, you'll have to consider its business model: Google Search is not making money from presenting your content (or shop, or company) to the world. Google Search uses your content, enhances that to make money of ads. Same as Reddit actually.
There is nothing wrong with this business-model, but there's nothing wrong with the content-owners demanding some payment in return for their content being used by Google to make money of ads around that content.

That depends on the usage. If you buy a good USB-drive (i.e. not the cheapest/most GiB one) and use it only for backing up the wallet you are fine. 
And it will probably last longer then that disk on that laptop you are throwing around on the couch, pooring coffee into, or dropping on the street. 
1. Buy a small usb drive, you need less then 500 Kilobytes. That way you can easily afford a relatively expensive one. And probably don't use that giveway one you received on the job-fair.
2. Watch the mechanics of the drive. Go for the most solid one. 
3. Keep the drive in a clean and safe place. Having it travel around on your desk between used coffeemugs, empty beercans and sigaret-ashes won't do it good. 
4. Only use the drive for your wallet. Never think "I need to bring that presentation tomorrow, but cannot find my other drive. Ah well, I'll use the one where I keep my wallet on for once. 
Just think that you are putting maybe several thousands of Euros (or dollars) worth on that disk. Often worth more then the computer you are using bitcoin on is worth. Treat it as such.

They do: other payment providers. Moneygram, Paypal, CCs, iDeal, Sofort and so forth and so on. ATM these are all still a lot more expensive.
While for me, -personally- transaction costs is not a reason to like or use Bitcoin over things like Paypal, it is so for a lot of people. 
Actually, I too would not pay my Pizza in Bitcoin when it costs 5% more than paying it with Euro's when both offer me about the same in ease-of-use. Let alone that people who don't yet have any Bitcoin would start exchanging, just to pay their pizza's if doing so is always going to be more expensive than simply paying in Euro's

The real answer is: use them. 
1. Accept BTC for whatever you make money with in your current currency.
2. Offer payments in BTC for whatever you are buying. 
3. Consider buying your stuffs at businesses that accept BTC even if that USD shop is a bit cheaper.
That is the only way the price will remain rising, the spikes/bubbles will be smaller and your investment (in BTC-shops, BTC-services, BTC-knowledge) will truly give you benefit.

The overall BitCoin exchangerate, almost entirely dictated by trades on MtGox, has not suffered a crash. And since they opened trading again, volume has gone down, but not in such numbers that it has a negative influence on the BitCoin economy.

If Zimbabwian citizens would start trading in Bitcoins now, they would benefit greatly from it.

As with any online service: you have to trust them. Or not. 
The more value (business-notes, addresses etc are also value) you put into that service, the more you must trust them. 
A service gains trust by:
1. owning it trough good customer relations.

The difference also is, that in pyramid schemes you are fined, or will loose money if you don't bring in more people. 
Such mechanisms are a *legal requirement* for a pyramid/ponzy. Without it, it is just a smart business model. Without this loophole, stocks, loans and bonds would be outlawed as pyramid-schemes.

As one of the commentors over there points out: it is always bad to put all your worth in one place. 
Putting your entire wealth in one single gentech company is just as stupid as buying money in one single currency from all of your savings. 
Diversify: where having some money in BTC is probably the best bet. 
That said, Putting money in BTC also helps "fix" the fundamental issue that causes the current crises: the current monetary system is fundamentally broken (if it were not, we would not be looking at plummeting exchangerates in .eu right now, would we?). Looking and investing in experiments to fix this, is always a good thing. Even if it won't bring you any personal profit, it will help the global cause in the end.

Patent trolls often go after the (secondary) users if the supposed patent-breaking company is too big or too solid.
Notice Samsung and HTC being put under pressure for Android and in lesser extend google itself. 
If bitcoin-sold, anonymous software would offer protection, trolls would do the same as they do when the patent-breaker is too big for them to take: they would go after the users. Probably not single consumers, but IT-departments who rolled out the software on large networks, resellers and a few single, yet high profile users.

The point is that you cannot own wealth unless you have irrevocable and unrestrictive access to it.
The other point is that many people therefore think: "but €1.80 is not wealth; so Bitcoin is never a good way to pay of a can of beer".
 Yet, when you look at the receiving person, a shop-owner whose entire wealth consists of sold cans of beer, a sum of €1.80-ies, an irrevocable access to that wealth is important. 
Which makes Bitcoin important for both a storage of wealth *and* a transaction medium.

Because Satoshi quite certainly has a huge wealth in Bitcoin.
Any tax will do a lot to get their hands on that. Which would be all the reason not to disclose it. 
However, let's assume the tax officers have reasonable proof you are that person and you have that wealth. They now have legal means to further gather evidence. There is a good chance they'll simply out you as "satoshi" at some point. Either because court papers often are public or because someone will leak such an interesting story.
When the tax officers have a good reason to assume you are satoshi and you know they are right, and you know that their proof is sound. I think that makes a really good moment to come out yourself.

The pins now have one hole on each side. Each has one other pin, or a padlock.
Imagine having two holes in a pin, having two padlocks, you'd need to remove both the padlocks on one side, in order to shift the pin out. 
This is not a true 2/6 because youd need *the two padlocks on one side of the pin* rather than *any two padlocks*.
So, you'd to combine padlocks. Everywhere where you'd see one padlock now, you'd have to. Having every combination 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 2.3, 2.4... etc. You'd need a lot of pins.

Nice article. And yes, I think we are saying the same. 
Oleg, however, does not differentiate between the differnt kind of investors: an investor who does not believe in Bitcoin, other then the hope that someone else will buy them from him (Greater Fool Theory), is doing Bitcoin some service, but also hurting it: volatilty.
An investor who starts a company, writes articles, buys goods, sells miners and so forth, is a very good and sustainable solution to the problem he describes as "Bitcoin’s biggest barrier to become a widely used currency is simply number of hands that hold it"
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:34:53


I would argue that there is a difference. This difference would stem from just before this state:
If I have €600 and I buy 1 Bitcoin with it, with the only intention to sell it just before the price drops, I am putting "only" €600 in the economy, after which, indeed the coins might well be considered lost.
But when I invest a fraction of that 1BTC, say 0.01BTC in secondary Bitcoin-value (buy goods with BTC, spend some effort and time on informing people about BTC) the Bitcoin-economy at large, will benefit: the economy gains the same total 1BTC, but rather then me pulling that value out fo the economy, the moment some volatilty occurs, a part will remain, driving the value up sustainable.

No. There are many other reasons. Let me tell you a recent one from my experience:
* Me - Hey Client, there are several severe and dangerous holes in your webshop. Not suprising considering the spagetti that makes this shop.
* Client - How long has it been there.
* Me - Between a year and half a year. They were not there on the initial release, from what I can see in the history. Introduced during Foo and another in the Bar-release. 
* Client  - A, yes. Particular messy releases. Lots of stress, pressure and deadlines. Rushed code.
* Client - But right now, leave them for what they are: those new features you a bolting on, are more important. After all: the holes have been unexploited for months, why would some hacker abuse them now.
* Me ....
* Me - right. IF you sign this document, taking all responsibilty and waving all my responsibility over here at the cross. I am fine with it.
Or: In a software-process there are many stakes. Security ought to come first and for all (IMHO) but in the end, balancing money, targets, and responsibilities, it often comes after others.

Actually, I have been wondering (but still have no idea) how much this entire BTC-thing will bring us (being the widest possible society of web-developers) in terms of security-software, -practices and tools.
For one, the BTC-community still loves Open Source. Many large BTC-companies release their sourcecode and libraries open-source.
Secondly, the community is very tech-savvy and demands transparency and open-ness.
This is very different from how "our" banks work; even in 2013. Ever seen the code for the authentication-mechanism for your bank? Can you even imagine your bank releasing their "encoding"-algorithms?
I really believe that, even if the BTC-economy proves a total failure, we, the greater community, will have gained a lot of security- and insurance- practices and software from BTC.

And to wonder further: how much that would increase when more people get into Bitcoin?
And to include a little, dishonest math: how many Bitcoins were stolen from "own computers" since is was founded and that this sum is probably in the ranges of the 1% wealthiest people around?
What I am trying to say is: sure, storing $100K worth of wealth in a place that you have control over, is a good idea.

Certainly! We cannot blame anyone: this is a free market with everyone making their own choice. 
However, at this moment volatilty is not that big of a problem, yet. Nor are the people pooring value into BTC. Any value!
What I am saying, is that we must be very wary of the "tulib bulb". When too many folks, **too much of its value**, is in hands of people who have no believe in Bitcoin, nor wish to see it florish anywhere other then up to moment they sell (the bigger fool theory), we do have a problem. 
Right now, a bubble "pops" but does not drop to zero! The reason is that a lot of value lives, apparently, in a much more sustainable, less liquid, form of the Bitcoin economy. That is good.
But lets keep it that way.

It is like my doctor knowing many intimate things about me. And the nurse helping her having access to these intimate records as well. 
The difference is that Doctors have been handed that trust by us and go through a lot of trouble, protected by a lot of laws (at least here, in not sure about your country) that allow them to live up to that trust.
But bankers, albeit in somewhat the same situations, are making a serious mess out of that trust. In my country, .nl the company handling most of the PIN (maestro, electronic transfers) even wants to sell all the transaction-details to marketing firms and other interested parties. 
We gave banks laws that allow them to protect our privacy; even from governments. We entrust them with a lot of intimate information. Banks have (by law, at least here) the obligation to live up to that trust. Yet in practice they simply fuck us over.

On a larger scale, Germany is apparently doing a lot of things a lot better then most other European countries. I live next to the German border (.nl) and look with more and more envy to my neighbours. Who make decisions and stick with them (green energy); better and more often than we do. Who have a growing economy. Lower employment rates. More confidence in the economy. Less racial hatred and more open political views. I am not saying that in absolute sense, but *compared to most other EU countries*. 
If you look where Germany comes from: two dictatorships in 70 years, merging a economy in waste less then 30 years ago (DDR), becoming the one economy that drags the rest of Europe along, that is a great feat. Compared to our (.nl) undecisive, depressed and once-were-so-progressive way of "doing things", you are certainly doing them better.
