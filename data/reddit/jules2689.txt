I honestly prefer buying stuff from Shopify stores. Shopify has a ton of curators and artists, so you know their stuff is hand made.
I also love supporting the little guy, and know I will probably get good quality stuff :)
We make quite a number of purchases from the shops we host, just cause we know how friggin awesome they all are :)

Bitcoin wil be accepted "soon". We have a 'working' model on our payment gateway, but we need to make sure it is secure, and 100% functional before release.
