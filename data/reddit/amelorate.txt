Nope, actually said along the lines of "We support Bitcoin Classic."

Just Theymos probably won't change anything. We probably need all of the mods to step down and have a vote for the new mods of somehow.

An idea would be having the people wear a vest with a camera attached. Although there may be some privacy issues and preventing theft.

I wouldn't say bait and switch would be the right way to label the technique. It's mostly rebranding.
Also on the topic of social techniques, a better way is to simply not mention the name until the person is interested, although this could create some backlash as the person may rebound to their initial bias against bitcoin upon hearing it's name.

Love the downvote bots. If they aren't bots, they basically are from their robotic actions.

"Opt-in" is only on the sender's side. The receiver does not have a choice in the transaction using RBF. This breaks 0-conf and enables some kinds of double spending.

Since apparently the words relating to cubes are now profanity in this subreddit, even size neutral stories about it.

That is true, however is bad in a usability standpoint, since it is somewhat difficult to display error messages on a refused transaction. You could do it on the merchant's website, but that also has usability downsides. 
Also, if everyone refuses RBF transactions, why implement it anyway? Nobody wanted it, there was no consensus.

replied to myth  [The post was made in another subreddit, but I've included the text here.](


























This is probably true, but it seems to me to be fantastically irrelevant.  Yes, there are people who do not work for Blockstream who want to keep blocks small.  I would imagine that any person who 1) understands the situation and 2) wants bitcoin to fail would likely fall into this category (that doesn't mean all small-blockers want bitcoin to fail - read carefully).  How does that counter the myth?  Is it not possible for both of these hypothetical people to exist:








Again true, but again irrelevant.  Just because these people wanted to keep the block sizes small before they had a financial incentive to want to keep them small doesn't mean that the financial incentive they have NOW isn't driving their current desire to keep the blocksize small.  That doesn't mean that it IS what is driving their current desire; I'm simply pointing out that this argument makes no progress in "debunking" the "myth."


This is a straw-man fallacy.  His argument hinges on the use of the strong "force" in the wording of the myth, as if the people on the other side were saying that high bitcoin processing fees would inexorably compel people onto the lightning network against their will.  But that is not the position of the large-blockers (which is what makes it a straw-man).  A carefully enunciated objection from a large-blocker would not use the word "force" or any other verb that suggested the end-user had no choice in the matter.  We **know** that there are "plenty of alternative solutions with which to transfer money" and we know that they all suck; that's why we use Bitcoin in the first place!  We are watching a group of people who, as far as we can tell, are actively trying to destroy a revolutionary and near-free system to transfer money so they can put their own not-free system in its place to make money for themselves!


Maybe that is the case.  Maybe there are super-stupendous reasons for keeping the blocks small that have nothing to do with the lightning network.  How does that debunk the belief that at least one of the reasons why the core developers are doing this is so that there is a market for the lightning network?


He is saying: No he wants to steal the cake so he can have it.  You should not worry that he is stealing the cake since his reasons for stealing it are different than you think they are.

People not understanding Bitcoin and thinking its a scam.
