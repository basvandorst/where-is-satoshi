Bittrex is taking waay too much then, I think they might be riding on all this talk about Bitcoin and high fees and just taking advantage to take a bigger cut.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:42:22
This is an issue?
Are the developers doing anything about this?
Would appreciate a link to look at or something to read more about what they're going to do about this issue.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:44:08
Wtf you onabout dude, if you don't wanna help maybe don't comment.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:08:06
I usually do that, but this time I put buy orders on bittrex for alt-coins and since they weren't met and bitcoin has increased almost two-fold since then, I've decided to just keep it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:48:37
I don't know what's happening then, bittrex is asking for almost 10% of what I want to send.
I'm going to try at another time and hopefully it's less than 3-4 dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:32:24
I use bch also, but I still believe in btc in the long term. It just needs to sort its shit out. It's the first of its kind so it's going into scaling without having any prior history to learn from.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:43:34
Oh okay, that's good. Hopefully this gets sorted soon, it wasn't this bad when I started buying cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:52:20
I've sent from bittrex before about a month ago and it was 1-2 dollars, for it to go up 10x is crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:56:15
Yh I won't, but doesn't this go against what bitcoin was made for though?
Are the developers doing anything about this? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:59:58
Shit... hopefully more will adopt segwit if it's going to get any better in the mean time then.

Was he convicted of that?
Any proof that may lead you to believe that?
Or are you just another mindless parrot?

Firstly, they're still a risky investment.
And no one knew of Bitcoin when it was at $14 so the phrasing


Doesn't ring true.
Imagine lying on Reddit about your Dad's investments.

Ffs, the original commenter talked about wallet security...
Please read my other comments towards him.
All the other shit has nothing to do within he technology, it's to do with the eco structure around it.
If he's talking about the eco structure then he is right, currently it's like the Wild West. But if he's going to talk about the tech and make outlandish claims that the tech(wallets) are not secure. I'd like to see evidence of wallets (software) being hacked or compromised. Not a human error of someone being careless with malware they install and playing fast and loose with thier private keys.
Humans are stupid, binary and math isn't

Nothing noteworthy has been developed on Bitcoin as of now to sort the privacy issue.
Shapeshift into monero is my best advice.
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:12:04
All I was doing was invalidating what you said, which was Bitcoin wallets are not secure.
Yes they are, so far they haven't been hacked and I doubt they will be.
All the other shit you're talking about is man in middle attacks, fraud tactics. Nothing to do with the actual technology.
We could have technology from the future and there would still be fraud and man in middle attacks. It's human nature, people become lackadaisical and criminals bank in that and take advantage.
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:24:40
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:52:02
How are Bitcoin wallets not secure? There hasn't been one hack into a Bitcoin wallet to date. Stop talking shit.
Security != Insurance
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:20:42
Of course you're right.
You're fucked if you loose everything because it really is no one else's fault but your own.
I'm not saying Bitcoin is 100% ready at all, there are positives and negatives in both sides.
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:59:03
Saw it on r/cryptocurrency actually but o.k
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:04:26
Thanks again, I'm watching videos online every day now about Bitcoin, segwit,lightning network and recently just started looking at the fork in august but it's hard to get answers about the fork on this subreddit since it's a touchy subject.
I was wondering if I have any questions about BTC in the future if I could pm you, you seem knowledgable about this space.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:50:24
This is because of low demand and low use for bitcoin because of the down-trend but I do believe not all of it is due to this. A significant part is due to the LN.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:16:51
Excuse me?

The  handle on twitter, used to belong to Bitcoin Cash supporters.
Twitter took it down and put it back out there for anyone else to use it.
Some Spanish kid ended up signing up with 
I thought he still had it but maybe they got it back. I will have to check. Happened a couple weeks ago.
Edit: they must have got it back, just checked.
Dunno what happened then
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:08:11
Read the white paper, they're not marketing anything. Nowhere in ethereums white paper does it say it plans to be used as a currency.
Seeing as you don't have any comments on exactly with vitalik said in his long twitter thread tells me you really don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:20:47
This comment helps who?
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:23:58
But specifically in his tweets, it seemed to be much more about BTC vs BCH.
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:00:50
A stupid topic? Fine tell my why it's stupid?
That's the whole premise of this post, tell my why you think LN is better than bigger blocks.
Educate me, I'm stupid.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:30:34
Legal problems?
Bitcoin is open source dude..
Whether we like it or not, Roger owns r/BTC and Bitcoin.com and  The only thing it does is confuse on mass.
Don't just chat shit. Go to bitcoin.com and you'll see that they actually reference Bitcoin (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC). No one can do anything because Bitcoin is open source (great) but it does open up problems like this.
So exactly what legal problems are you talking about?

That conditional will always be true, he's not comparing he's setting it.
It should be if (this == true)

Because I think Bitcoin cash is another version of Bitcoin which is great. Just the same with Bitcoin Diamond and Bitcoin Gold. The technology behind them is great and ultimately what I'm following.
I'm just asking questions here to learn, not to go on one side or the other.
So could you further elaborate on the linear scaling problem Bitcoin Cash has? So you are saying ultimately at a point they will hit a snag where increasing block size will not be enough?
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:41:08
Not really, I'm pro BTC, however my knowledge isn't the best. I think it's good to ask questions. But when you ask questions what do you get? People calling you stupid and not helping at all.

@_date: 2018-04-05 16:19:57
Thanks for that information, if anything it will be exciting to see how things play out.
Surely the BCH team recognize this scaling won't work though. What is their reasoning behind investing in such a flawed concept of scaling.

@_date: 2018-04-05 14:20:11
Okay, I really want to stay away from speakers and believers in each technology.
But can you go into more detail, specifically about the technology?
Why is Bitcoin cash no different to PayPal. It was where Bitcoin was 1 year ago no? Technology wise, all that's changed in BCH compared to 1 year ago for BTC is the block size (increased to 8mb)
Are you saying that because of the increase in block size, the centralization of the currency is increased? And if so How?
I am not in the side of either but just trying to learn about the two scaling ventures before making decisions.
That's why I stay away from the speakers and just look at the technology.

Ethereum and Bitcoin are not competitors so I think you're argument is stupid.
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:53:01
Thanks so much for providing me with actual facts and details about the two different infrastructures, the first decent reply I've managed to get in my two posts on this subreddit.
So your first point about bigger blocks, they will need to process much more data per day (half a terabyte a day) which smaller nodes can't compete with therefore driving them out of the market which in turn increases centralisation to a few nodes; okay that makes complete sense to me.
What do you mean that when blocks aren't full, there's a possibility of inputting spam transactions? Isn't that the point of the node , to determine whether a transaction is valid or not therefore no spam transaction; I don't quite understand that point.
You also say with lightning we won't need to store every transaction forever? Doesn't this defeat the purpose of a blockchain? It's a connected ledger, it's meant to store all transactions right?
Why would blockchain congestion still be an issue if lightning network is fully adopted? Isn't the point of LN to avoid congestion in the network.
