i dont like the dollar bitcoin glyph, i hope it doesnt catch on. bitcoin should be international and should not have the dollar as template.

A password with [100] bits of strength would require [2^100 ] attempts to exhaust all possibilities during a brute force search.
a password with 15 digits (only a-z A-Z 0-9) should have something around 75 bits entropy

but can we agree that bitcoin &gt; cash because it replaces cash AND money transfer with your bank over larger distances.

I didnt go into bitcoin to do workarounds because of regional locks...   
If Circle is not available in my country, it is not worth my time and money.

To all who don't understand it:    
The 31c3 is a german hacker congress and the "Seidenstraße" (which means silk road in english, but don't confuse it with the darknet silkroad) is a system of tubes from a group of artists which installed this in the building where the 31c3 congress was at. So visitors can send stuff through these tubes, like love letters or hard drives. The point here is that you can make a bitcoin transaction with a physical piece of paper. It's just for fun, and the installation only was temporary. But you can theoretically use a piece of paper to make a bitcoin transaction offline, without internet connection.

yes absolutely! cash has many advantages. i just wanted to say that if exchange is down, you still can transfer money internationally with bitcoin within minutes, which is not possible with cash.

i use 25 and with special characters (,.- etc.) but i save it on keepass, so i regularly dont have to type it in. i think everything above 100 entropy is safe.

isnt the energy consumption really high with old pc parts? i would think a raspbi is cheaper in the long run.
