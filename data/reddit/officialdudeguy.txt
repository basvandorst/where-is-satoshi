I don't feel bad for you at all, fuck off.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:24:32
Sounds like a birth of a subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:10:53
Sorry, wrong one.
Currency transaction report (CTR) is required for over 10k, and optionally a __Suspicious Activity Referral (SAR)__ 
Coinbase legal probably: better to keep it and deal with lawsuits than have the IRS on our ass anymore than they already are.
Me: Why did you deposit that much all at once?
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:06:32
One, you might be correct but I'm not the one you should argue with. but


I wouldn't be surprised if IRS went so far as to consider bitcoin as the legal tender of the cybernation bitcoin, just for the purpose of being a dick.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:47:33
i don't think people bashing are really against or for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:22:24
If I have more bitcoin than the transaction, would that count as money? Then, what does that have to do with any of this?
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:17:12


People can make mistakes, and corporations are people, my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:11:12
Always buy, when you want to sell you won't need to.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:31:38
Depends on how you used it, if they had an issue with fees they should have given more cryptocurrencies as options. Higher fees, high cost of bitcoin, and that, it's just us and not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:16:07
i agree.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:50:17
Who here is at all bruised?
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:57:13
I am joking :D
But seriously, people would think going back to $200 would be devastating to bitcoin, as if its price in USD had anything to do with the network.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:35:46
omg and it's crashing now!!! if only we could go back to such good times!!!
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:07:07
you transferred a thing that could be valued at 10,000 us dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:32:25
No, seriously, steve, give me an answer. The fuck does my money have to do with me not caring about someone sending more than they should to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:48:07
You should sell it for ripple, and don't share it with your brother.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:40:35
just that if you were to go back in time and made a transaction that it would change all the subsequent blocks, ensuring an altered timeline
but maybe somehow if that didn't happen, it would mean that it's already happened and the evidence of time travel is already on the blockchain
then there was something about bringing bitcoin back in time
I'm sure there's a 10,000 btc blockbuster book and movie in this somewhere
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:29:06


It shouldn't be.


Wrong market, get out now.


You're telling me if someone was selling them for a dollar or two you wouldn't buy some? Oh wait, you don't believe.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:24:47
Did people stop using it last time it went to 200? Did people stop using it the first time it got up to 200? Do you really think the network would shutdown, which is what bitcoin is. Bitcoin is not coinbase, regardless of whether coinbase controls the private keys to most of the bitcoin. Bitcoin is not USD, regardless of the price people want to sell it for.

*be okay with losing it all.*
@_date: 2018-08-26 00:55:37
no, the satoshicent hasn't been implemented yet.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:15:55
that's probably the shortest way to phrase my current sentiment.
I am just glad they were useful more than any value.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:41:33
I was doing some thinking, and I didn't really come up with something, but I figure the nature of blockchain makes time travel somewhat more interesting.
Though, again, I didn't really come up with anything of substance.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:08:26
a real relief of going to the bathroom
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:55:02
1 btc is about 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:47:10
I agree.
@_date: 2018-03-08 11:26:35
More the power to them, i look forward to the bitcoin sales.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:44:01
stay caml.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:18:22
that's my roller coaster gifv.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:37:04
did we prove existence was real?
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:28:05
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:34:58
i'd bet that it would be worth about one bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:17:40
don't like the price? just wait a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:37:26
oh thanks, literally a second ago - 
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:22:35
buy the dip
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:13:17
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:32:24
Because they hodl and you didn't, duh.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:36:13
no, she's a keeper.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:43:57
maybe, but we're being unreasonable.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:53:04
Last 3 years feels a bit different.
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:38:59
No, you got 12x on your USD investment.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:38:25
I also hear people use the term put dollars onto the blockchain or something like that, or calling an amount of bitcoin by some fiat value.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:35:32
No, that is like 0.013 doge.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:56:45
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:27:28
It's redist and sexist.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:28:56
maybe talk to your husband about how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-06-18 06:23:04
No, it's bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-18 06:22:07
