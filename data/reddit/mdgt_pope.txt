You made a blanket statement without any additional clarifying statements.  Regardless of agreement, what you originally said was incorrect.

So, basically, every comedian, be it stand-up, acting, or internet content, has mental instability.  That's a very blanket, sweeping statement that can't be true.

I'm not taking it out of context.  I read the thread where you began that argument.  You're saying that the person who started the website to mock BFL had a mental issue because he spent his life making fun of it.  You then said that anyone who spends their time making fun of others to get joy of out it has mental issues.  I was just making a counter-statement that it wasn't true.  He can have mental issues (such as low-level autism, which may force the person to focus on something insignificant), but you didn't say that.  
Now, if you misspoke, that's a different story, and I would be fine with that.  But you didn't say, "***Excluding comics, who make a living off of mocking others***, mocking someone for joy is a sign of mental instability."  
I haven't said anything to argue your point that the person who created the website had issues.  I am only trying to get you to qualify your statement, which you now have in previous comments.  I have proven why you did, in fact, make a blanket statement, but now you have retracted and reformed your comment.  
Have a great day.
