This lmao. If the world goes to shit you definitely want gold as it can be traded physically. Bitcoin wouldn't be worth shit if the world order collapsed.

I just don't see how you can think dismantling the entire government would be better when the government already does so many things right and the wrong things can definitely be fixed. The system you're proposing has more flaws than the current system and doesn't provide much more benefits.

I just don't see how 


means anything. Despite the fact it probably isn't true for most adults who have bosses they respond to at work and have children that see them as the head of the household, lets assume it's true. Even if it was true I don't see how that would mean that an anarchic system would be superior to a democratic one. The last thing I will respond to you with is that I certainly don't feel as imprisoned as you suggest you are with "someone looking over my shoulder" and the fact is that most people don't or else there would  be more people buying into this. People living in democratic countries such as the U.S can enjoy the freedoms they do because of the laws and regulations set in place to protect others from infringing upon our freedoms, of course, not all laws are necessary and some are even harmful but that is why laws and ideas constantly change.

Listen man I'm not on the debate club or anything trying to build a perfectly valid argument. I just wanted to let you know that its fine to dream a little but being delusional is not healthy.

I just wonder why the fuck do you go out of your way to do composting/gasifying shit. So much extra work just to try and contribute to an anarchy that'll never happen. It seems like don't really have a fundamental issue with taxes but instead in the way they're used. It's just interesting the extreme thought that since some of our tax money is going into questionable things we should just dismantle the entire government as if that would be better.

Its such a crazy delusional. Like what do they think will happen when there is no government like way back in the day? The rich and powerful will forcibly take over and create their own government. Anarchism is a meme I thought people we over after the 80's lol.

My guy you are actually delusional if you think this exponential growth can be sustained for longer than even a few months.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:10:41
No one is denying that exponential growth is occurring at this moment. All I'm saying is thinking that it'll continue for years is just not in touch with reality.

You're oversimplifying it a bit with maintain control over other people but I can see how you can interpret it that way. If you bring that up then it becomes a deeper argument of is "controlling people" really as bad when you're doing it to allow for others to live a stable and safe life? Everyone's answers may differ but regardless of your answer anarchy is never a viable solution and has been proven so over and over again.

I just want to chime in that anyone who buys into anarchism isn't going to really be swayed by logical counter points as to why democratic governments are the best system and why taxation is a necessary evil. The problem usually runs much deeper than that.

When companies were allowed to go unregulated in the mid 1800's they exploited workers and paid them just enough to not let them starve. Sure there was massive innovation and scientific discoveries but at the cost of human rights. Anarchy wouldn't fix poverty and the main problem with it is that it is not stable. Nothing it stopping another powerful rich person from taking over in an anarchic system.
