Should have used your Bitcoin to move to a foreign country where you can't get sued for student loans.

| since 100 million Americans pay zero taxes
Bullshit. You can't leave the store without paying taxes. Your home gets seized if you don't pay property taxes. Even if you rent, your rental income goes to pay the taxes.
You mean zero income taxes, which is a progressive tax, 1 tax out of dozens.

Citizen and subject scale? There's a completely arbitrary fiction of the mind if I've ever heard one. I have 11 guns and feel the same amount of being a subject as if I had none. You going to use your guns when the government uses imminent domain or spends another trillion dollars to invade another middle east country? Good luck taking down those planes and missiles.
 Your peashooters aren't going to protect you if the government ever decides to move against you, complete and utter false sense of security.

You can't snort bitcoin. It is not inherently useful on its own.

lol, the US economy isn't going anywhere.

My withdrawal of bitcoin has been processing for at least a day, is this considered one of the issues?
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:05:25
Yes, you can... I think limit is set by the exchanges, I've seen limits of .01 I believe... If bitcoin was worth a lot more, they would change the limits.

Most studies have found this to be completely false. Apparently the belief is a coping mechanism to help parents deal with the pressures of being parents.
"Using data sets from Europe and America, numerous scholars have found some evidence that, on aggregate, parents often report statistically significantly lower levels of happiness (Alesina et al., 2004), life satisfaction (Di Tella et al., 2003), marital satisfaction (Twenge et al., 2003) and mental well-being (Clark &amp; Oswald, 2002) compared with non-parents.

They could ban the exchange of USD to Bitcoin... pretty sure that would kill it.

Probably a rising infrastructure based on bitcoin... ATMs, banks, etc.

... if they made it illegal, which was the premise of the higher thread... yes, It would be illegal.

Um, you might as well just buy and sell drugs at that point, considering both are illegal. Though I do get a rather hilarious image in my head of meeting a bitcoin dealer on the corner of 34th street in the shady part of town.
