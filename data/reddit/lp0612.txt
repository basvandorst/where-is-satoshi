No not three months old but i have surely seen a negative development in indian btc exchanges as most of the exchange's bank account are getting banned by their bank there is a problem of cash flow in the exchanges delayed deposits nd more delayed withdrawals

But what if i sell the alt for eth it remains unchanged right 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:11:51

Because its the mama coin and always gonna be ! But actually the thing is there are not many exchanges providing usd pairs for other currencies to buy other u gotta have btc ,some people keep some reserve to buy dips of altcoin! Also lightning is coming btc is going to get better but surely tough to beat other coins in terms of fees and speed but early entry to the market always wins ! 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:07:42
Same thing, i thought usd value of the alts should remain unchanged ! But it keeps falling with btc

Well mining depends on difficulty and hashrates if a large group of people stop mining difficulty goes way down ! So the people mining get more bitcoin so eventually it all settles in to a mean
