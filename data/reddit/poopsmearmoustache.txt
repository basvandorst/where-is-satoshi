if only people knew that the USD release algorithm is controlled solely by the devs and banks are double spending everywhere which is why it takes time to 'find' your real coins.

Who decided money had to be completely stable to keep the plebs non-economists minds at ease? fiat already moves slowly over the years and people keep up, what's stopping people from accepting that money's value can fluctuate more rapidly?

mega-ego Musicians as an authority on Bitcoin adoption?

Makes sense though, since they are basically marketing geniuses using what ever mind trick they use to get people to enjoy listening to lyrics of how they make money off their inferior customers.
naaaa' mean
... They are pump and dump kings in my book.

Just a generic paper without much substance. 
Consumer protection issues were mentioned without much focus on the swing to merchant protection. Transactions rely on trust of both parties and bitcoin allows for a different power structure here too. Merchant reputation happens to be easier to manage as there are less businesses than consumers, although it is a lot easier to sell fear of fraud to consumers than tell them about another alternate way of viewing transactions on top of every other mind fuck they have to have to understand bitcoin's core features.

Don't take it seriously, you could logically argue that most businesses, currencies and ultimately societies fail, and that still hasn't stopped people from trying to perfect them. I would argue that you can't kill an idea especially not one that has the potential to rewrite history ledgers.

value of the currency can still go down if it not artificially kept up and that is effectively the same as inflation from the spenders point of view.
because it consistently inflates it can look like you are slowly being taken from, but if it were inconsistent you would just have to get used to that flux in value, humans like stability and predictability though especially when governments main concern is to keep people from overthrowing the money issuer.

I actually think it's because some bands started accepting Bitcoin.
The move to ban wallets gave Bitcoin legitimacy as a worthy long-term adversary to Apple's marketplace, but it definitely delays time before general people start being interested in it. Non-tech people would only see the move as another hurdle into the ecosystem and can't appreciate the true reasons behind it. 
Apple wants people to maintain the belief that there is only one way to get, pay and use digital content.

Nothing they say is relevant to its development directly but what the government is willing to rule as unacceptable for tax paying companies matters to bitcoin's perception. 
It is an emerging technology/protocol with great potential and without a relatively sized marketing or sales team. The public perception and value is then open to anyone who wants to influence it.

some slogans I can see accompanying some gorilla marketing logos
*         one zero can change the world
*         bitcoin with us
*         
*         a banking era occurred in your favor
*         cash out, trade up, peer in.
*         regulate this
