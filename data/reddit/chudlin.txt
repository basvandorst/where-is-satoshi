looking at the shapes and a bit of math
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:38:55
is it seed words that im looking for or a PK?
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:05:07
i can see straight away that this is a puzzle and a very good one at that. thanks for the opportunity, very interesting
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:08:50
you use an exchange to monitor the realtime price
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:07:12
but we know mt.gox has been dumping for ages.. is this some sort of new news to you? or a post just because you can?

it still says that he gave her bitcoin a few years ago. just not that he created the wallet thats all
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:48:27
wow how you figure that? i found that i was looking for 15 or 12 of something but i dunno what
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:03:20
I suppose so. I hope we can break the 10k barrier soon, but with the current uncertainty of the situation regarding regulation etc i think we will be here for a while
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:13:02
there are lots of questionable things, but i just cant make any sense of much of it! tried math and others and cant make much of it and if i do it doesn't point me in any direction.. very hard! but whoever figures this out i would be very intrigued as to how it could be solved
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:52:49
this is a cool feature. would you add alts too?
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:28:54
i never had a problem with HSBC
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:52:41
Thank you ��

most likely because if youre in the game first, you can play it how you want and make big money.

wasnt this selloff for the conference thing happening between 14th and 16th? i think its ready to rise after this conference
@_date: 2018-05-26 08:09:54
would you mind dropping any other hints? :) 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:36:17
dont worry, i know what im looking for... a bit ;)
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:04:48
I agree. It makes me wonder who has this much money to make such an impact
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:39:17
some shapes, i couldnt figure why some of the colours were missing but now i think i know why, i will keep working now, i just got home :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:16:05
Sint will have 0 commission on their token transfers when they release their exchange
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:06:53
Could anyone recommend good websites to keep up to date with news on crypto? i find that i can read for days on end and then something will happen and i wouldnt even know about it lol 
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:08:46
ill try!! :)
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:28:13
you buy it how you feel is necessary. dont ask for advice on here as to how to look after your own money :X
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:24:56
it was wiorng, it wasnt a date
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:12:05
he never said he created the wallet, only that he gave her the money. but its possible that he could have created the wallet..
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:11:01
im not so sure, ive been at it a while haha. i think i have an idea but i have no idea which way to take it
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:57:15
i just went onto bitmex website. their exchange is extraordinarily fast
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:28:45
well this one does not.
@_date: 2018-06-05 00:15:25
a tiny ammount
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:52:03
That's because there aren't any words in the picture. Look a bit deeper.
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:19:48
It's no. Problem for me ��
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:07:50
so far i have managed to get some seed words that very nearly match up with the public address, but im still unsure as to where im going wrong. im literally super close.

i was just reading this, its media FUD at its best. anyone in the right mind knows that trading of any sort, crypto or not isnt an investment. companies can collapse at any point. the only investment you can truly make is in housing... its just media spreading shit at usual. bitcoin will rise regardless. its just bullshit
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:19:12
doesnt matter who owns what. when there is a new technology like asic, it isnt as easily adapted when compared to something else like a laptop that has been being produced since the 1980s vs an ASIC that has been made to the public in the early 10s. thats like saying, "lets compare virtual reality gamers to normal xbox / playstation gamers". obviously there will be more xbox / playstation users. asics dont make mining centralized, not even in the slightest. asics can be distributed, just like laptops and desktops can. the problem with distribution lies with in publicity and marketing. if you market an asic as the most powerful computer known to man and sell it at a cheap price in your local store, they will be slod out in no time. how many asics have you ever seen in your local superstore or shopping mall? i bet you the answer is 0
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:25:43
anyone can buy an asic, anyone can buy a laptop...
