It says here that it costs 1.5% on coinbase as a transfer rate but it looks like its showing closer 3% whenever I go to buy or sell. Im in the US, where is that other 1.5% coming from?
Edit: Found my problem. If you have your payment option set on credit or debit the rate is higher. If the transaction option is set directly to you banks routing number then all transactions above $200 or more will be around 1.5%.

Yeah that's right. I was just testing out buying in at $100. I just went back and tried it at $1000 and its showing a 38 dollar fee so that still maintains the higher percent rate even at over $200. Sorry if this is a pain, I'm just obviously missing something. Again, this is in the US.
Edit: I found my issue. My purchase option was set on my debit card so the rate established was based on that. When I switched it over to my bank routing number everything over $200 had a rate of around 1.5%. Thanks for all the help I am an idiot lol.

This is all convoluted to me. I don't fully understand the purpose of the Gdax step. Does this eliminate the charge for buying completely? And if so why use coinbase as a middle man? Couldn't I just buy all my bitcoin on Gdax for free and just leave it there? I'm sure there are obvious reasons why I can't but I don't really get what's going on with the Gdax part of the process.

Thanks for all the help, I think I figured out my issue though (see above edit). :)

I checked how much it would cost to buy $100 and how much for $1000 and for the former the charge was around $3 where as it was around $33 for the latter. If it were a flat rate charge on top of the 1.5% buy rate it should have been around $3 for $100 and then $151.5 for a $1000.
