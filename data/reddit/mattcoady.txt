When you wallet withdraw in gdax you can pick coinbase as an option. They're the same company.

You're better bet if you're already in the coinbase wallet is to move it to gdax (free since its their own trading) then sell ltc for btc on there and set any price you want. If it's realistic and you're patient you'll get a better return.

Ah sweet, looks like there's at least 3. 
Of course I'd get into this during record highs. I'll probably start small.
