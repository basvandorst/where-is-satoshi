And yet a bitcoin core dev offered it up as a possibility.

Are you bitcoiners still trying to use it in real-world shopping scenarios? Lol. 
Ohhhhhkay. Good luck with that.

Yes, Augur is using inTrade's former developers. Back when InTrade operated they were THE place to bet on elections. Therefore Augur, along with being decentralized and having the lowest fees will likely rise to being THE place to bet on elections.

Iota is either a magnificent game changer or unfortunate scam. This whole "Secret big plan" is unfortunately pointing towards the latter.

Since there are hundreds of alt coins out there, why not do this same analysis on those to see if this relationship persists across cryptocurrencies in general or if it's just an odd bitcoin phenomenon.
If it shows up elsewhere there very well might be something to this.

Someone(s) sold about 9k on bitstamp and 20k on bitfinex over the course of 15 minutes. Not that complicated. Market prices went down to absorb the sudden supply.

Technically every company stock you own could declare bankruptcy leaving you the stockholder with pennies per share after all assets have been divided out, if you're lucky.

Spreadcoin...the altcoin whose dev abruptly disappeared one day without a trace after months of pretty amazing work...so sad.

Of course the one person he's come across who could be Satoshi is Nick Szabo...just come out and say it, guy. We know it, you know it, Satoshi knows it.
@_date: 2015-12-26 04:18:15
Obviously not Satoshi...possibly a piece of shit altcoin though that's about to do a big unveil with this "Hash Tube" technology.

You completely skipped T+3 settlement, which will become a thing of the past with the blockchain...more to the point, this batch of new Overstock shares will be the first and only stock with T+0 instant settlement. This is basically the holy grail of stock settlement and will save banks $15-20 billion per year in infrastructure costs (Source: Santander Innoventures, 'Rebooting Financial Services).

This guy is totally one of the original Satoshi's. I'm convinced. Should be interesting to see where this goes next.

You mine a btc, you owe taxes.

Bingo. Someone award this thread to this person.

Those bitcoin are getting sold to the bitcoin trust (GBTC) and hence not the open bitcoin market so yes, solled is correct and you are correct that the sellers here to the bitcoin trust have to have held 12 months. So as long as there is a premium to sell bitcoin to bitcoin trust then hypothetically more and more bitcoin should end up locked in the bitcoin trust versus going to the open bitcoin market.

It took 90 comments by others to get to the right answer...but here it is.

At 2016-01-24 02:31:21, 9612 btc was progressively sent over and over at a decreasing rate over thousands of transactions until 7906 was left. 
Theft and laundering sounds about right.
Edit: Here you go, it was 10000 btc 1.5 days ago from 376 other addresses: 
Surely this is Cryptsy-related?
Edit 2: I've fallen deep down the rabbit hole here. I followed one of those inputs all the way back to the coins being newly minted. Long story short this person has been mixing over and over and reconsolidating again over and over every so often for years....I'd bet exchange coins... Here's one of the minting addresses I ended at from June 2011:
I'm out....proceed with theories.

Who knew someone named DakotaChiliBeans could absolutely hit the nail on the head like that?
@_date: 2016-09-04 01:38:01
Called Zcash.

He's being downvoted because it's clear he's setting up a Monero shill.

Shhh just let the people curve-fit SN into DK. They need to believe their leader isn't anonymous.
