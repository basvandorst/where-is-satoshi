gotta love the irony then in this case. The ad service thinks the website is about banks so it advertises a bank ad....but its about Bitcoin. I love it

Basically with Mycelium every time you make a transaction with your HD wallet it creates a new private key. This in no way limits you from transferring BTC from one Mycelium wallet to another. Instead of publicly showing that "Key X" received however many transactions, its basically saying "Key A received, Key B received, Key C received....etc" so it is nearly impossible for someone to know how much BTC you actually own (if someone really wanted to know).

Gotta exchange somehow

I don't care about ads. It's just the irony in this situation.

Only for the exchange, i told him to try Mycelium
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:55:21
yeah probably the same situation. thanks and good luck
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:31:51
Awesome thank you....on the reverse side what if you are exchanging from usd to btc and with coinbase it takes over a week. If the price/coin goes up would you pay the price when you first made the purchase or the price when you finally receive the coins?

ex. What is the closest street to the street you provided us. Then 4 choices A,B,C,or D and i have no idea what streets they are talking about. none in my area
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:26:15
correct me if i'm mistaken but i was under the impression that bitcoin had no intrinsic value. Or is that 'as of now'?
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:34:00
can you elaborate?

You guys were all a big help...If Coinbase didnt take 8 days to exchange my usd to btc I would tip you all! (but i have nothing to tip sadly :()
@_date: 2015-07-28 02:15:12
I would simply rather sell it to a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast at a nice discount than use Amazon or eBay...no need to get hasty here

It's a Samsung i'll have to check which model it is when i get home from work. It's a Chinese product with Mandarin instructions so if no one wants to take it off my hands i completely understand

This was the first thing i have ever purchased with Bitcoin and i gotta say "That was easy" -Staples...plus a great documentary!!
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:55:52
Yeah I saw the CB announcement this morning basically saying it may or may not happen
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:29:27
If coinbase does what?
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:19:34
I have the app downloaded just waiting for them to accept TD Bank. Pretty similar to the Acorn app...but with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:07:43
very new. But i do understand charts and when a price floor has broken there's a lot of downside potential, just gets me nervous, that's all
@_date: 2015-07-10 15:53:41
Cool. I put the order in last week so hopefully i the price got locked in around 260$. thanks for the help

"...in the struggle to attract clients"? 3 million wallets and 2.3 million users isn't much of a struggle compared to other companies.

In a nutshell, I need to sell some btc to USD quickly. Also trying to avoid selling to someone P2P.  Anything I can do?
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:03:49
When it comes to the FED in the U.S, “they print more” is wrong. The FED uses monetary policy to expand or contract the money supply.  They’re not sitting in a warehouse printing billions of dollars and dumping it into the market. 
Love the infograph though. Is definitely relevant to Venezuela and Zimbabwe where hyperinflation is a serious issue. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 06:55:49
Yeah sure, I'm always open for advice
@_date: 2015-09-09 05:49:33
Maybe, but I got involved and instantly became infatuated with everything about Bitcoin so I had to buy some
@_date: 2015-09-09 06:00:19
I've learned a lot about Bitcoin and how it works and the potential that block chain technology has to improve our lives. And I didn't sell everything it was just sad I needed to sell a small share of my holdings. No need to be a jerk off about it.

As much as I would love to help you, I can't. The other day was the 2 year anniversary of my dear cousin's death from an over dose on heroin. Reach out to your family and friends for the support that you need. Your not alone out here brother. I hope everything works out for you. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 05:47:30
I respect the honesty and I know how drug and alcohol addiction works. Some of my family members and a few friends are going through it. Reach out to the people around you and who care about you and, as you were with me, be honest with them. They will appreciate the honesty and they will help you get through this. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 03:52:32
There are endless upsides to bitcoin opposed to traditional banks.
One of my favorite aspects is the ability to send money anywhere in the world for barely any fee. If i wanted to send 100$USD to a family member living in a third world country with, lets say, Western Union, it could potentially cost me 120$USD. On the other side, if i convert 100$ USD to bitcoin using Coinbase they only charge a 1% fee and after that all i have to pay is a transaction fee when sending my family member the money. instead of my total coming out to ~$120USD, I now only have to pay ~$101.05.
Hopefully others here can enlighten you on all of the benefits bitcoin has to offer
@_date: 2015-09-09 05:37:37
What are you ordering?

I see what your saying. It will be nice when the day comes that if I want to donate 100$ I know for sure that the recipient will get the full 100$
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:45:05
So unless the price can catch up to each halving up until 2140 (or whenever we reach full supply) we can expect increased tx fees?
Do you think its possible that these fees can get as high as CC companies charge?
Idk i'm still pretty new but these halvings seem like theyre going to be bittersweet

Creating a cold wallet isn't that hard but doing it the simple way isn't 100% secure. Offline cold storage is veryyy safe but a bit more difficult to explain to others. Look into the ledger wallet. Inexpensive and secure

Sooo many of his lectures he uses the example with the parents to the kids "go do your homework". I laugh every time
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:52:56
i also think its going to effect tx costs. I also think some miners may consolidate together considering their revenues will basically become half of what they are now. This also opens the door for some problems.
Regardless of this the halving is definitely a good thing though, right? If bitcoin wasn't growing then there wouldn't be enough transactions to even get us to this halving...so i guess what im trying to get at is the halving is proof that the growth of bitcoin is real.
@_date: 2015-11-24 15:48:42
Many people around the world leave their homes and family behind in order to find better work opportunities. They then send a lot of this money back to their loved ones in their home country. This process can be expensive with traditional banks, but it is very inexpensive with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:44:12
Does this seem correct?
$358,380,000,000 was donated to charities in 2014
I'll be VERY fair and say 20% was donated with credit cards so that is $71,676,000,000 donated with credit cards. that amount multiplied by 2.5% for transaction fees comes out to nearly $1.8 billion dollars. So roughly the credit card companies made $1.8 billion dollars from money that should have gone to charities in 2014?
source for 2014 total donations:

I was just using one benefit that i like. there are many others
-govt doesnt have control over bitcoin so they cant issue more like they can fiat...when the fed pumps money into an economy inflation occurs (Zimbabwe for example, they had a 100 trillion dollar bill at one point worth roughly $.04 if im not mistaken)
-traditional banks are open when the common worker is themselves at work making it difficult for many people to get there. with bitcoin you are your own bank.
-there are no overdraft fees and very small tx fees with bitcoin
-banks are slow. 3-5 business days for certain transactions. bitcoin doesnt have "business days"
-Identity theft. banks have giant databases filled with home addresses, birth dates, cc information, social security numbers...everything! 
-bitcoin doesnt care about your gender, your age, your income, where you live. anyone can use it. i'm also pretty sure more people in the world have access to Wi-Fi (meaning they can utilize bitcoin) than they do a bank...but im not 100% on that fact
-you have to TRUST traditional banks to do good on what they say they will, and in many companies these banks are not very trustworthy.
--There are just so many beneficial aspects when using bitcoin. and with bitcoin you actually own your own money...you are your own bank...no one can take your money away from you (unless you dont properly secure your bitcoins).
You brought up paypal...if paypal thinks you are misusing your account, they will freeze your assets and your SOL.
I gotta get back to studying, hopefully i helped you become a believer, even if just a little bit.
To the moon!
