compared to a clean install of chromium? I'm getting similar results to the benchmarks -- my current daily driver is slower, and clean installs of chrome based browsers perform similarly, with chromium beating out pretty much everything. the gains you feel are probably from moving to a non-extended, non-customized browser, and not from any voodoo being done in the backend.

paper currency already is/can be  more anonymous than this, and Cali just 180'd on their anti Crypto bill, so I'm optimistic.
@_date: 2016-08-20 02:06:39
It's a nice leveraging of their already large p2p network, for sure
@_date: 2016-08-20 02:07:01
No good info on that front tbh

The european central bank holds the vast majority of greek debt. if Greece defaults, then the rest of the EU is screwed too. The message of the article isnt that everyone should be using BTC, just that the IMF is a living, breathing reason for adoption

It was only a matter of time considering the ridiculous measures the "certified traders" have to go through
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:05:14
Granted that was negligence on BFX's part.

you never know. people laughed at the oculus rift and the article cites a respected bitcoin figure. you think he's retweeting it for no reason?

As if that'll ever happen. How long did it take them to root out the corrupt FBI guys after silk road again? I don't imagine the Department responsible for ICE will be any better about it.

nice bait. very little of this is factual or rational. comes off like the rambling of a homeless man in the throes of an intense fever dream

it's a set of exploits, only some of which rely on JS injection. others utilize this bug:
to fingerprint tor users, the other exploits just add a layer of certainty to the fingerprinting process:

Email Wincent if you think it's fake dude he has an open contact form on his site.
At worst this is a clickbaity title.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:06:22
eh. still, not really an expenditure. Most you can really claim is power cost if we're strictly talking what it took to advertise on Bcash's coinbase headers.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:36:12
Enlighten me then
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:03:35
Just email him and ask. I'm sure he'll clarify for you
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:00:03
Haha how so? Wincent is a miner and just switched his hash power for like 12h. He's pretty well known in hong kong and was using the coin bases for free advertising.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:50:05
"[we mined it wrong on purpose, as a joke](
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:01:03
fair enough. 
From what I understand this is a pretty small percentage of Wincent and his goon squad's hash power though, and it's an opportunity cost, not an actual expenditure.
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:08:25
yeah, but that's an Opcost, not an expenditure.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:18:10
how do you figure? 12h is what, 72 main chain blocks, a vanishing minority of which they would have been awarded had they stayed.
That's like 90K best case with free power, and that's assuming they switched all their hash power with no subsidies, which they didn't.
