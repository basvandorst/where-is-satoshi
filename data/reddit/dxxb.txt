Maybe we differ on this point. I see education as improving everyone's well-being and happiness. When I see a homeless child starving in the street, I see it as my duty to help that child.
When I see others who are indoctrinated, through no fault of their own, I try to educate them with logic, facts, reason, verifiable proof. It may not work for everyone because indoctrination is a bitch, but if it reaches someone, then I am happy.

i am open to evidence. always open to evidence. ghosts, aliens, anything supernatural would be amazing and i fully embrace this possibility. there is currently, to date, no scientific, verifiable evidence of a god.
“If all the evidence in the universe turned in favour of creationism, I would be the first to admit it, and I would immediately change my mind.”
―Richard Dawkins


I believe it because there is no evidence to say otherwise. i believe it is not raining outside because there is no raindrops coming down. simply evidence-based.


well, if others are believing something without scientific evidence, then yes. do you believe other things that have no evidence for shits and giggles? why should that be respected or encouraged?


“Faith can be very very dangerous, and deliberately to implant it into the vulnerable mind of an innocent child is a grievous wrong.” 
― Richard Dawkins
“If you are religious at all it is overwhelmingly probable that your religion is that of your parents. If you were born in Arkansas and you think Christianity is true and Islam false, knowing full well that you would think the opposite if you had been born in Afghanistan, you are the victim of childhood indoctrination.”

In other episodes, especially earlier in the in-universe timespan, a monetary unit known as the "credit" is mentioned. At the Federation space station K-7 in the original series episode "The Trouble with Tribbles", set in 2267, Uhura offers to buy a Tribble for 10 credits. In the episode "Errand of Mercy", also set in 2267, Spock estimates that Starfleet has invested over 122,200 credits in his training as a Starfleet officer. In Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, in 2285, while on Earth, McCoy attempts to hire a ship to take him to the Genesis Planet, and is warned it would be expensive and cost many credits; we do not know if McCoy could have afforded this or how much it would cost, since he was taken into custody for breaching the secrecy of the Genesis Project immediately afterwards. And in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Carol Marcus mentions the Federation's decision whether or not to "fund" the Genesis Project itself, though "fund" means something different in this context as credits are not mentioned. In the Deep Space Nine episode, "You Are Cordially Invited", Jake Sisko tells Quark he sold his first book, but when Quark asks him how much was gotten for it, Jake answers, "It's just a figure of speech." This explains moments when characters have made similar comments (in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, for instance, when Scotty mentioned having "bought" a boat).

As bitcoin gains popularity, more people will have heard of bitcoin more than they have of public/private keys or of anything encryption in general.

Rooting can also increase your security by eliminating some backdoors such as Carrier IQ, but neither rooting nor not-rooting will eliminate higer level ones such as  .
If you have an open source "su" program, and an open source stack, I'd argue the rest of it can be more secure than not rooted.

It is possible to embed backdoors on the hardware level though, that may never be discovered. If someone else is making the phone, then there is an opportunity for control.

I'm going to go ahead and cynically say this has several points of failure, and this is just marketing blather.
To be clear, I would love to be wrong on these points.
 A nice effort, a good direction, the market is admirable, good for raising awareness, but not as good on privacy as it could be.
* Closed source hardware - hardware bugs exist in common hardware, and are in use, and are hard to detect.
* Closed source software - Their VPN and encryption software I am going to bet will be closed source. No way to verify security.
I would say the safest way to use this device would be like all other android phones (and all other computers, really) is to use a completely open source OS on it, which, really makes the whole idea of a special phone moot.
Update: I've contacted freedompop about these issues and they promptly closed my ticket.
