frequently used argument on benefits of bitcoin, that the blockchain technology can remove the need of centralized trust, ie. car or any other property registrations, wills, etc.  
how exactly it would look like?

you know you are Eastern European, starting a sentence with  an *actually*. also, probably a Hungarian, bragging about his glorious country and it's alleged great men. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:58:23
also, want to draw your attention, there is a [bounty]( offered for you for making a Bitcoin video.
@_date: 2014-06-13 06:04:55
well, that's obviously not going to be costly.
@_date: 2014-06-09 11:51:58
great answer, thank you. 500 bits
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:55:10
up already
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:48:58
for what?
from the image attached, only scenario I can assume is the bank to operate as an exchange.
@_date: 2014-08-07 06:50:41
how much do you buy?  
because, if you buy 0.1 BTC, then you pay only 2 - 6 USD premium, already spending ~60 USD. is that so much?  
 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:20:03
at least you got your bill accepted. every time i go to France, Austria (well, it took me twice to learn it) for skiing, I just took  a 500 EUR bill with me (I'm from Lithuania, we do not have EUR as a currency). that should be enough for me for the skiing pass and as a change for a week. i expect to change the 500 bill buying the ski pass (costing around 200 EUR), when suddenly... they do not accept it. I cannot also get it changed at near cafes or souvenir shops. then i have go to find a bank and do almost the same procedures as OP has described.

when exactly are auction results will be anounced?

I can trust SpiderOak just as I can trust Dropbox. my question was more like should I be worried if I have long and strong passphrase?  


seriously?  
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:30:54
did you finish reading my comment?
@_date: 2014-05-12 11:08:51
what if I go to an exchange (which requires a verification), deposit there an x millions of USD from my bank account, buy BTC for all of it and transfer it all to a cold wallet, lets say, and let it sit there.   
tax collectors  still see the *bank -&gt; exchange* payment, go to the exchange and they report, that a particular amount of BTC was bought, and transferred to a particular address, which is somewhat associated to me. 
 
what then? 
@_date: 2014-06-01 07:34:26
it will mean much more if you ~~hodl, spend~~ hodl or spend and rebuy. 
EDIT: punctuation.
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:19:08
sadly, the conversion is not the first result, so far.

 Hello! This fee is applied to cover the costs associated with processing and handling the booking, not the Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2014-06-09 10:43:03
several questions here:  
1. is it a good idea to store on Dropbox a backup of a .pdf with BIP0038 encrypted wallets, that I have printed out?  
2. what is a multisig; what is the easiest way to use it?  
3. what is a vanity address?  
4. what is a brain-wallet? 
link to an explanation is also appreciated.
@_date: 2014-06-20 05:39:54
ok, NOW  I believe, Apple have changed their policies.  
EDIT nope, not yet.
@_date: 2014-06-27 10:04:51
still unclear, according to [coindesk](  
sad this will not be an ebay-style auction, open to public, which you could just add to your *watch list*.
@_date: 2014-04-16 09:25:33
do they accept bitcoin? why would someone then not *undo* a transaction to *bitundo*?
@_date: 2014-10-09 12:29:33
...aaaand it's on the coinmap.org!

such recent developments leads me to a conclusion that it's only a matter of time when Ryanair will announce the same.

oh, back in the day, i went up to +6 BTC in JD and ended up at -2.6 BTC. this loss was huuuge for me, so I could just try to imagine what is to feel at his place.  
after that, went back in with 4 BTC as an investment and am now +1  
@_date: 2014-07-07 11:15:08
the more you get into bitcoin, the more CC is a scam.
@_date: 2014-06-12 06:37:29


what's his point here?
@_date: 2014-07-17 06:32:25
exactly. he has used BTC symbol in 3 of 5 his last videos.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:23:10
were you keeping all of your BTC at mtgox?
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:36:11
gonzopancho - i mean, literally, who are they? located in EU, never heard of them, not even google helps. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 20:37:05
and zero payment processing fees. at least they got the point from the very beginning.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:49:58
you were absolutely right, and I edited my comment. just letting you know, probably it means so much to you.
@_date: 2014-07-29 12:12:01
looks more like an ice cream shop to me.
@_date: 2014-07-16 07:27:26
well, signs show that CGP Grey is really into bitcoin, at least till some certain degree:  
- he has written a [blog post]( of his first impressions about bitcoin;  
- he has first used a coin as a symbol of money in a [video]( from 2 years ago;  
- he has also collected some tips over time.  
so, perhaps, that is really a million miles away from what we are trying to do.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:12:14
For me it's an opposite. I take out my CC and brush it everywhere I can. I sometimes make even 0.1$ purchases with my CC. (Aparently, here in Lithuania, we rarely have a requirement for the purchase to be at least 10$ or similar to have a CC accepted). That is my way to show vendors, how expensive that is and maybe it will motivate to look for alternatives.
@_date: 2014-06-05 07:45:38
all those people now working in the banks. what ar they gonna do if bitcoin will take their jobs? did you ever think about that?  
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:44:29
what's the story behind?
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:28:34
fee is here probably to make a more attractive fare price. however, yes, that fee-thing doesn't make things look that good.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:28:09
let me ask you this way - what share of your total BTC wealth has went away together with mtgox?
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:32:46
no, no bot used, just keyboard shortcuts.  
and thanks for my first tip ever, keen to find out how this service is used.
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:23:06
ok, help me get this - how can a bank benefit from adopting bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:12:36
Your point is good. Anyway, if a merchant has some common sense, first thing he will do, is look where to cut costs, and, possibly discovering Bitcoin, before increasing the price.
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:04:40
i'm going in with some coin if it still stands.

@_date: 2014-09-09 13:35:41
unfortunately this is a very likely scenario.
@_date: 2014-08-01 06:17:15
10.000+ of EU-only merchants at BitPay, when at the same time just [5.095]( are visible in coinmap.org worldwide?
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:32:07
does it really say **technology**.lt in the URL?
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:29:42
Exactly. And as I told - maybe it will motivate him to look for an alternative --&gt; Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:06:21
cool, thanks a lot. there will now be 2 cards of this design, if you don't mind.
@_date: 2014-01-27 11:43:59
you are correct here. but then again, the email example works perfectly here - back in a day, it was more comfortable to send paper letters, just because they pop in your mailbox and there was no need to own a computer and have internet connection. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:22:19
you must be very happy if that's your biggest mistake with bitcoin. especially, when, probably, it's NOT a mistake.
@_date: 2013-12-28 10:11:24
I too lost my 8 BTC, with the dice. 2 conclusions here made:
1. don't gamble;
2. if BTC is going to succeed in the end, this will be one the reasons for it - just how easy is to operate with it.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:04:04
first thing, what i'm going to do tomorrow is get up and try it
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:04:51
this purchase is killing the rest of your bitcoin, that you have left
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:52:09
[my experience]( with buying BTC with those FOXBOX machines. i believe pictures are informative enough. not the most convenient (and, probably, not the safest) way to get BTC, but did it's job, and, probably, is OK at least to start with. BTC bought from Lithuanian BTC company SpectroCoin. they emailed me my public and **PRIVATE** keys!
btw, got 0,02035867 BTC for 50 LTL @ 978 USD/BTC, while 843 USD/BTC @ bitstamp.
finally, it's OK as a first atempt and still much has to be done. meanwhile, i doubt i'll be getting BTC like this till then.
