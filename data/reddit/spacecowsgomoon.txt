No it won't. It will be based on the 4pm Gemini Auction price.

This is only for pricing GBTC bitcoin, not *all* bitcoin ETFs as the title implies.
The COIN ETF will use the 4pm Gemini Exchange Auction Price, as stated in it's S-1.

They should end up the same. Traders will be able to arbitrage between the BTC price on the exchanges and the COIN price. This will lead to the gap closing.

Ah. Thanks for the advice, I'll stick with the 64GB SD and run in pruned mode then!
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:18:27
Whoops, I meant 1GB. Fixed now.

Daemontools look great. Will def be using them.
I will add blocksonly to the run arguments.

Thanks! Damn didn't realize how big the blockchain is already... Guess the first thing I'll need is an external HDD instead.

So a pruned node will not provide archival services (as it does not contain the entire blockchain) but will still provide block validation services?

Yeah a desktop sync was always my backup plan. Just wanted to see if I could get the whole process done reliably on a pi. Might end up grabbing a pi 3 as you suggest though.

Ah ok, I saw that setting and thought I would use the minimum to save memory. I guess the db cache speeds up the initial blockchain download a bit?
OS is Raspbian Linux 8.
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:09:18
Yeah I thought as much, I'll try and give it a go first anyway.

Good engineers plan for the worst case e.g. that this trend does not continue.
