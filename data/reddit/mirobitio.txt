They have been removed from bitcoin.org because of this.
tldr; Some fraudsters took their code and used their app to scam people. Also uberpay.io took their code, rebranded and uses the back end coinomi servers.
That is why they decided to change their license.
I wonder how other wallets handle this kind of abuse?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:38:53
During the first 1-2 years most blocks were empty. There is no guarantee that there are transactions in the mempool.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:42:28
And will be. But so far Antpool is first pool that hurts his own interests and the interest of the community.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:37:06
If Antpool would say that they believe big blocks are harmful to the network and that's why the mine small blocks, I would be totally okay with it.
But unlike the core devs, Antpool thinks 8 MB are no problem for the network. So there is no reason for them to mine empty/small blocks (besides SPV mining). 
They have given no reason for mining empty/small blocks. And that is the part the worries me. Not the act itself.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:01:56
Then you fork off. It is harder to get rid of Bitmain than of devs. You need a POW change and that is more difficult than a "simple" fork.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:07:24
Lol, did you even check the block? The block was mined one hour after the last block. Same with all the other empty blocks today
Empty blocks because of SPV mining only happen when two blocks are mined within a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:38:17
Emergency hard fork to change the POW algo to something GPU friendly.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:01:25
Done. Bought with good old AXA controlled Core coins.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:15:07
It happened 5 times in the last 24 hours. Should be enough time to fix it. Especially since they are able mine normal blocks.
It looks like the empty blocks settings are only active on some servers.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:56:59
Can we please stop with these "I made x millions with bitcoin" posts. Makes this sub look like a bunch of greedy douchebags.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:48:45
The problem is that with irrational miners like Antpool the network becomes unusable (if all behave this way).
Bitcoin only works if miners at least follow their own best interests. People forget how important it is that miners don't do non-profitable nonsense like intentional reorgs or mine empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:34:07
I wouldn't call 0-1 or 20-30 blocks per hour normal. But at least most Bitcoin Cash miners behave rationally (mine the most profitable chain). Can't say this about AntPool.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:50:21
Agree. That is why Jihan has been fighting segwit so fiercely.
Now all we need is a change of the POW algo.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:10:11
You are overpaying. Almost all wallets are terrible at estimating fees.
20 sat/byte (0.30 $ for avg tx) is totally fine if you don't need the tx to be guaranteed in the next block. 
I never pay more than 20 sat/byte and 90% of my transaction get confirmed within the next the next block.
Monitor the mempool to see what fee is needed:
Don't send tx (or increase the fee) when a spam attack (spikes) is in progress.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:26:33
But the spend utxo is still the same. You can't spend an output twice. One of the blocks would get rejected by the other miners.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:19:06
08/08? r/btc will spin this a secret alt-right message.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:40:43
There shouldn't be a single mining on Antpool. By keeping the tx fees, miners lose 10-20% of the reward. These has been going on for a while. I don't see their hashrate dropping.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:09:52
Please explain why a miner would voluntarily miss out on 77,400$ (only today).
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:22:47
They took the code and removed any mentions of the original authors form the license file.
I would consider this as open source stealing.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:54:53
It doesn't make any sense. The voluntarily missed out on 25,000$ fees.
This is why I am so worried. No sane person would do that.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:27:52
Mining an empty block an hour after the last block clearly shows malicious intentions towards Bitcoin.
The missed out on 4-5 BTC fees (20,000$). I don't know why any miner use their pool. 
EDIT: I know that Antpool keeps the fees anyway, but why not switch to a fee sharing pool.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:50:40
Sure they can. The difference is that luke is just one of a few dozens core devs without commit access. Bitmain on the other hand controls for than 50% of the hashrate. 
So if they want they could seriously disrupt the network (empty blocks, reorgs). Of course this would cost them a lot, but they have shown that they are willing to lose money to push their agenda.
Bitcoin's image can seriously be harmed if miners behave irrationally.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:52:12
Just because they are allowed to do that, doesn't mean that we have to accept it.
Any miner who cares about his profits should leave this pool.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:37:35
Indeed a good site, but they need to fix the trust scores. YoBit and Bittrex have the same trust score as Kraken and Gemini?
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:18:15
Finally a trustworthy exchange to dump Bcash.
[List]( with exchanges that support Bcash deposits.

If the scanner scanned the QR Code wrong, blockchain.info should have caught the error by validating the checksum of the address.
There are three possibilities:
* Malware
* Scanner broken and blockchain.info doesn't valid the checksum
* Bug on client and server side. The server passed you the address of another customer and the local JS code is buggy.
If you are really not infected by malware, than blockchain.info has some serious security and quality assurance issues.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:54:35
It is a cool project, but I am sceptical that people will install an add-on. On the other hand it is probably way to difficult to create an alternative platform that people will actually use instead of YT.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:50:57
The problem is that we will never get ride of them without changing the POW algo.
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:01:53
Agree. There is already a working testnet app:
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:59:39
Well, if you are happy with Bitman trying to control Bitcoin, then please stick with Bcash and r/btc.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:10:15
This is gold:


They talk about the growing UTXO set, but there is still some irony. They don't even mention the main reason for segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:53:14
Hard to estimate. The thing is that the difficulty will be lowered by 20% if less than 6 blocks were found in the last 12h (based on the median time). So miners could be holding back to get the difficulty lowered. 
It might take a while till the median time of the latest block is 12 hours later than the of the 6th block before.
Worst case: 38 hours
It will probably be less. Yesterday, 30 BCash blocks were mined.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:01:33
Miners could easily fill the block with self generated transactions and still ignore all valid transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:02:42
It's probably different servers with different settings/software.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:25:35
Note: Bitfinex requires 20 confirmations for BCash deposits. Only one block has been mined since they opened deposits.
Big dump will come tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:43:40
That is a good question. They could have easily prevented segwit.
Maybe they wanted to split the community even more. Not sure want their endgame is.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:57:02
If Segwit2x was the reason, why didn't people buy the cheap (0.15) futures?

Would be nice to see a statement want part of the gov announcement forbids bitcoins exchanges?
I thought it is only about ICOs?

I would not call 500 responses the German community. Also the author of bitcoinblog.de (Christoph Bergmann) is a big Bitcoin Unlimited fan (member) and anti core. Most pro core bitcoiners probably stopped reading his blog a while ago.

Stop posting links to bitcoin.com. They are officially calling Bcash Bitcoin:

Would like to hear comments on this.
I think they fixed the "Bypassing PINs" issue a few weeks ago. Not sure why they don't use a secure enclave.

Don't forget Jeremy Allaire, Mark Karpeles, Peter Vessenes and Jiang Zhuoer (BTC.top).

This is not a step by step tutorial but it might help:
You can import your blockchain.info private key into Electron Cash and spend your bcash from there.
If you want to be 100% safe you need to wait till blockchaininfo rolls out bcash support.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:30:45
I think they processed them before but they finally raised maxblockweight above 1mb.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:01:48
A really nuanced statement. I wish them the best. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:05:35
Your bitcoin cash is still there. Thanks to the replay protection, your transactions wasn't accepted by bitcoin cash miners. You need a bitcoin cash supporting wallet to spend it (Electron).

Check this site to see how many transactions are in the queue before yours (one blocks removes ~2000):

Copay recently implemented a custom fee option thanks to user demand on Github. Their fee estimation is sadly still unusable. Tells you to pay 298 sat/byte for a confirmation within 20 minutes at the moment.
