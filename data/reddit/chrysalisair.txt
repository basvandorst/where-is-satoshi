You forgot to mention that cash can be traded anonymously, which makes it a popular way of funding illegal activities.

As a crypto journalist, I get paid in crypto. It's quite common practice. Most sites I write for are based around the world (often e.g. Gibraltar) so it's way more convenient and saves fees. Maybe this is a bit niche for now as employers are unlikely to be able to pay in crypto for a while but wait until they realise how efficient it is, especially as more companies become global. One site sent me $300 via Paypal and then had to cover the $20 fees.....
