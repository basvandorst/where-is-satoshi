I mean everyone expected a price increase because many people believed in the conspiracy theory. Sometimes these things are self-fulfilling prophecies.
And anyways it doesnt matter, you can go and check for yourself that the combined amount of btc on all the contracts was just over 8k. Do you realize how much btc they would have needed to dump on the market to drop the price from 14k to 9k? Even if they had a stake in every single contract it wouldnt make sense. Not to mention that for each short there needs to be someone on the other side going long on these contracts.

Volume on all the futures contracts was insanely low. There were only 8500 btc worth of contracts up in entirety anyways. There might have been market manipulation involved and honestly almost definitely was but it had nothing to do with the futures contracts

Yeah thats true. That applies to the rest of the other top richest though. bezos could never liquidate his amazon shares either

To be honest though bitcoin is draining a lot of money from alts, and a lot of these people arnt in bitcoin because they ideologically support it its just the market chasing profit. The lower value on a free coin is more likely to have downward pressure on our price unfortunately

If we're being honest here you should probably advise him to wait a little bit. As great as core is, we have to admit that a lot of the recent bull rally has been the market leaving alts to buy in for a free s2x coin. If your grandpa buys before the fork and doesnt know about it hes going to get screwed

I dont disagree with you that a temporary retracement might be ahead of us but you have to remember why btc fell from 5k to 3k back then. It was the china banning icos drama. Some negative news would come put and btc would tank and then largely recover, until charlie tweeted that it was basically confirmed which triggered the huge sell off. If not for outside negative news btc probably would have stayed around 5k

If the relief of no longer having to deal with the contentious fork is going to be upwards buy pressure, then why have we been going on an insane bull run before the fork?
You have to realize that outside of this community most of the market doesnt care about bitcoin on an ideological basis. Its just profit driven. Obviously nobody can read the future but honestly not expecting a drop in price once people get their free s2x coin is a bit delusional.  The total crypto marketcap only passed the mc when we were at 4.8k before the china fud less than a week ago. Every alt is extremely oversold right now into btc because of the promise of free money. If gramps buys in now hes going to get burnt.

Mutual funds are ass compared to index. Theres no reason to choose the former

I mean im glad for you but its not really an achievement. I know plenty of people who have never traded anything before and made more during that decent bull run. You didnt need to me smart you just needed to pick literally anything that wasnt a shitcoin

Go look at the depths charts on any major exchange and see how much money it would take to move up the price. Yes depth charts arnt completely indicative of how many new orders pop up as you buy and the fact that theres plenty of exchanges but either way its a whole lot less money than 2.2bil

Becauses theres advisors and then theres intermediaries? If youre just an intermediary your job isnt to disallow you customer from buying what they want to if you dont agree with it

Lollllll how tf is that market manipulation. If any industry leader gives a strong opinion on something its going to influence the market in some way. So basically it should be illegal for rich and powerful people to voice their opinions? The market doesnt give af about dimon. 99.9% of the recent movements have been due to the china drama

We can acknowledge that hes annoying and understand that its not unexpected with his age. If you go around telling everyone youre a genius trader analyst literally 24/7 im not gonna say people are wrong for calling him annoying just because hes young.

Most people have most of their money in investments though, not liquid fiat since thats what btc is replacing

I mean lets be honest, a fair number of them are probably nerds that got lucky. What do you imagins the social atmosphere to be like there

Its not like we needed rick and morty fan levels of high iq to see bitcoin as a worthwhile investment. So really when we bought in pretty much depended on when it happened to really catch our eye. For example it was a bitcoin atm in the wild and nonbusy afternoon that led me to look a bit more into this bitcoin thing. Was pretty much luck i happened to see it that day, or i might have gotten in later.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:23:23
I remember being online looking at the charts literally that day actually. We failed to break 5k and it dipped about 80 dollars and then was going back up to retest. As it was going back up that was when the china news first dropped. So that was the reason for the dump and downtrend

Bitcoins the future but can we stop calling opinion pieces propaganda. It makes us sound like a cult

Hows that different from gold exactly? Gold has some inherent utility but thatd only account for a tiny, tiny portion of its value, not 7 trillion dollars market cap.
