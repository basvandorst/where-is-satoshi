Yes, unless its also not a coincidence that they represent 149597871 kilometers.

And now its back to $16000 :(
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:20:01
Thank you so much! I plan to listen to a good number of these!
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:16:35
1. It went back down to $16000
2. Where on Earth did you get 50% in 24 hrs? It has not been 12k in a while
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:47:59
Haha remember back when bitcoin was $16000 this morn- ... nevermind its back down t- ... alright I'll settle for $17,000

Not the way its going right now, no. However i think Bitcoin is more than just the blockchain, it is the idea of decentralized unregulated currency available to everyone with low transaction fees, which lives on in other cryptos

I don't know enough to make an informed decision, but some might argue that Ethereum or Ripple *does* embody this idea, in which case the idea of Bitcoin lives on

I'm sorry dude, identical situation except I got lucky and achieved the withdrawal threshold and cashed out a few days ago. I would've been very angry if I'd gotten fucked, may you have better luck in your future mining endeavors!

0.02 btc here, I'm hyped!

Could someone please explain to me a brief timeline of segwit, the uasf, and segwit2x up until now? I am new and trying to wrap my head around this but everything has been happening so fast recently, half the articles are from five months ago
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:10:39
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:51:05
Yeah I mis-spoke, I never received it because of the time for transfer due to ACH
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:16:53
Hi iamcursed. I share your predicament but to a lesser degree, I only bought about 30 minutes ago (this was my first transaction, used Coinbase. The btc still hasn't showed up on my dashboard on their site or transaction history. Should i be concerned?)

Thank you for responding! So with BIP148, the non-miner nodes activated a soft fork. In one branch, they only accepted Segwit-complying blocks, and in the other they accepted both. The hope was that the UASF chain would grow "longer" and thus become the primary, dominant chain and the Legacy Chain would be ruled null and void. But how would miners lose money by sticking with the Legacy Chain? Wouldn't their accounts essentially just be rolled back to the moment the fork occurred because all transactions in the Legacy Chain would be invalid? Also did they "reject" non-Segwit blocks in the UASF chain by just refusing to build on top of them? And is the only change in Segwit2x the 2MB hard fork?

I made my first ever bitcoin purchase at 6:00 EST on Oct 12 when I woke up and saw it was spiking. I invested $150 and made a respectable $15 profit, but my bank cancelled the transaction later in the day for no apparent reason :( I never spend large quantities like that so maybe they thought it was fraud but I lost my $15 profit and another $10-15 that it took to get back in it now that the price is higher
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:15:05
How would bitcoin become more sound? I believe its tied to currencies around the world and fluctuates in value based on the news, its by no means "sound money"
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:16:55
Thank you so much for clarifying! So with BIP 148, did it actually cause Segwit to be accepted or did that come naturally?
Also just to clarify, BIP 148 created a separate branch that only accepted Segwit blocks, ratifying Segwit just on that branch, and if more work was put into that branch than the others then it would become the primary branch? What was preventing opposers of Segwit from adding non-Segwit blocks to the UASF chain?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:10:43
Yes! I just made my first ever transaction yesterday morning and it was with Coinbase, I was real sad when I realized there was a waiting period. I wanted to play short term investments, buying and selling multiple times a day and now I'll be able to!
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:04:11
Thanks so much for helping me to understand! It makes a difference to a noob!
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:44:30
ooooohh thank you
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:43:23
Thank you for the reassurance!

I don’t understand, is this post making fun of the quote? What’s incorrect about it?
