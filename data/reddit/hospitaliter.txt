Is anyone else excited for a dip down to $8500 to pick up some coin?  That idea used to worry me, but I've gotten to a point that I have no huge worry that it won't be going back up again permanently in the possibly near future.

Yeah?  It seems like they've done a pretty good job with the National Parks.  The fucker that said this would have put a billboard on the Grand Teton.  What a retarded fucking post.

I think it's inevitable that better technology will come out, and many "alt" coiners will constantly chase after them.  The reason I think Bitcoin will still remain the gold standard is that technology will continue to be built "on top" of bitcoin (lightning network, etc) and will bring full functionality regardless.  So in my opinion, if Bitcoin gets "obsoleted" by another coin then crypto is over as we know it because there could always be a better one.  I think Bitcoin is and will remain king.

I can't help but feel technology will continue to be built for BTC to make up for any shortcomings... I think that BTC won't necessarily be the perfect coin, but nobody would trust crypto if another one can just come in and replace it as the "gold standard"... because if it is then we would just wait until the next coin replaces that.  If that was the case crypto will have no confidence.  BTC will remain the leader or nothing will.
