Yes you are right let me rephrase my post, at last one country has finally accepted bitcoin as a real currency. As i have mention in my twitter in the past, the first country to accept btc will probably be the centre of btc. Singapore has come foward :)

This so Old news. It was already possible in Dec 2013. Nobody noticed

The correct link: 
And my favourite part of the article:
“If the UK tax re-categorisation goes ahead, it will stabilise the domestic Bitcoin exchange market which had been threatening to move out. It would also probably start attracting European and even global trade to migrate to the UK as it will be one of the first countries to have a well thought through tax regime.”
To the MOOOONNN: I just love saying this
@_date: 2014-02-15 22:58:51
So there is only one option TRANSFER YOUR FUNDS TO BITSTAMP ASAP. :)
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:07:51

@_date: 2014-01-17 22:48:47

If we had one clear and trusted website where we can get all this info!! Someone like Max Keiser should be good! He knows the market and his actualy a bitcoin ambasador.

Guys relax, I have been using BITSTAMP for almost 4months now and I know the rate is much lower there but I can confirm that the withdraw process is done up to 3 days. Never delayed! I haven't heard any negative new about bitstamp
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:23:49
