Huh. I was on  at that time. Went by ghostxxx. The friend who got me into FreeBSD went by tog. There were a handful of others too. We all started hanging out there in 96 or 97, when JKH was still active in the project.

I have a ton of Peercoin... I'm just not on the Bitcoin boat.

Well stated. I use the "electronic funds" argument all the time. When I tell people that only 3% of US currency is physical, they don't blink an eye... I don't think they get it, yet I normally follow up with: "meaning, we do most of our transactions using a card and don't touch cash at all. Beer, gas, food, etc., are all done using a debit, credit card, or if you're 90, a che[ck,que]. 
*edit: of course, I'm leaving out the massive transactions executed by the government, corporations, etc., but that's aside from the point.

This is off topic, but, what you say is funny as it describes me somewhat. 
When I was in my early 20s, I worked for a small cable/DSL internet company, configuring head ends, routers, dslams, etc. I got the job because as a teenager, I taught myself FreeBSD, got a job at a small ISP in Ft. Worth, TX, learned Solaris and subsequently networking (as all good UNIX admins do through attrition). I still work in IT (sadly) but not in *NIX stuff anymore, but I'm not yet into my 40s. 
ISPs back in the late 90s, early aughts, were filled with people trying to get a leg up in the industry. We worked hard to know the shit we did. The dotcom bust was fucked. I went from making $26/h at the peak to just about $13/h, as you said. I got laid off 7 times in 6 years because companies would hire you, then when the fiscal year ended, you'd get laid off to make the company's books look better. 
To this day, the shit I learned from being a UNIX admin feeds my ability to fake-it-until-I-make-it in nearly any IT industry. I've worked as a SQL admin, Business Intelligence designer, Exchange Admin, Coder, Network Admin... and now, SharePoint Architect.
IT blows goats these days. Nothing is guaranteed. Knowledge can get you by, but you have got to be extremely specialized or extremely adaptable, like myself. Anybody in-between is tech support.

I super love and empathize with this statement.
