Im not. Im hoarding one I bought cheap for the long run until im financially stable in order to get some. By stable I mean where 10% of my total income can be used for risky business.  It was pretty easy to do when bitcoin was less than $100. Youre right though, considering the gist of my first comment.

The fact that Bitcoin is a top 10 google search topic in the curiosity category should make this post the most upvoted one today; heck, for the entire week. Top 10 in the entire world, in a search engine used by billions, people! But look, useless TIME magazine just accepted Bitcoin as a barely mentioned third option, let's upvote them instead!

The world economy:

@_date: 2015-01-09 11:53:35
Okay guys im out of the loop. Last I heard bitstamp lost $5 million woth of Bitcoin, what happened this time? Any confirmations that they stole them?
@_date: 2015-01-09 12:04:46

As much as we know right now. She could have asked if he wanted to help with the gift before this screenshot and make this out as a surprise. Its a bit of a cheap move to come out of the woodwork with the "we" move.
