You forgot the part where the plantation owner never really had a legitimate right to the land in the first place and based his ownership on 200 men meeting in a room and scribbling on a sheet of paper that it's theirs and they make the rules.

yep because we all know that the US healthcare system is the quintessential example of the free market. There are no laws or regulations involved in the US healthcare system what so ever.

No, he thought he could dazzle you with terms and hopefully you would think he is smart and agree with him. Unfortunately the only thing he accomplished is revealing that he has no idea what he is talking about.

It seems you don't understand the definition of fiat. When people call the dollar a fiat currency they are using the word to mean by decree. Meaning that the dollar is money only because the government ordered it so. Bitcoin on the other does not meet this definition. People are choosing voluntarily to transact in Bitcoin sans any sort of government decree or threat.

"With the rise of democracy, the identification of the State with society has been redoubled, until it is common to hear sentiments expressed which violate virtually every tenet of reason and common sense such as, "we are the government." The useful collective term "we" has enabled an ideological camouflage to be thrown over the reality of political life. If "we are the government," then anything a government does to an individual is not only just and untyrannical but also "voluntary" on the part of the individual concerned. If the government has incurred a huge public debt which must be paid by taxing one group for the benefit of another, this reality of burden is obscured by saying that "we owe it to ourselves"; if the government conscripts a man, or throws him into jail for dissident opinion, then he is "doing it to himself" and, therefore, nothing untoward has occurred. Under this reasoning, any Jews murdered by the Nazi government were not murdered; instead, they must have "committed suicide," since they were the government (which was democratically chosen), and, therefore, anything the government did to them was voluntary on their part. One would not think it necessary to belabor this point, and yet the overwhelming bulk of the people hold this fallacy to a greater or lesser degree.
We must, therefore, emphasize that "we" are not the government; the government is not "us." The government does not in any accurate sense "represent" the majority of the people.[1] But, even if it did, even if 70 percent of the people decided to murder the remaining 30 percent, this would still be murder and would not be voluntary suicide on the part of the slaughtered minority.[2] No organicist metaphor, no irrelevant bromide that "we are all part of one another," must be permitted to obscure this basic fact. " - Murray Rothbard

Ah the good old "everyone is an idiot expect for me and government officials" argument. There are 4 ways in which money can be spent. We can spend our own money on ourselves, in which case we attempt to maximize both utility and economy. We can spend our own money on someone else, in which case we attempt to maximize economy but care less about utility. We can spend someone elses money on ourselves, in which case we maximize utility but don't care about economy. Or we can spend someone elses money on someone else, in which case we care about neither utility, nor economy. I will let you interpret which situation describes the government, and what the problems with that system might be.

Well I disagree with your assertion but that's not what I was arguing. I was just saying that Bitcoin does not meet the definition of a fiat currency.

They kidnap people for smoking plants that I don't like, they blow up tons of brown people for me, they bail out banks for me, they hand out subsidies to corporations for me, and they keep two people of the same sex from marrying each other. What would we do without them?

Its almost as if the free market rewards the entrepenuers with the greatest foresight and ability to forecast future demand. Its fine for people to be risk averse, but don't complain when you miss the boat on something big and then blame the people brave, or crazy enough to take a chance on something.
