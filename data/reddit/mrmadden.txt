We don't even have public IPOs every week.  You will have a valuable index in several years, but it's a little early to look to a cryptocurrency VIX at this stage.
Right now, low volatility is the key for nothing more than disproving specious, myopic arguments that price volatility makes bitcoin undesirable as a store of value.
  
Low volatility just means that the speculative froth rolling boil has calmed to a simmer.  Mark my words: we have not seen the end of price volatility.    
There's something to the saying:

It's ridiculous to stake the future of a working, production system on solutions that only exist in a white paper.  The idea that we should delay the scaling of the block size because it will increase the demand for lightning network or similar sidechain schemes is completely insane.
I agree that a lot of those dragging their feet on bitcoin XT are arguably bought, paid for, and not acting in the best interests of bitcoin at all.  Some of them have a history of this sort of thing.  Still, I don't think this justifies advocating for a "benevolent dictator".
If we actually hit any sort of congestion because of delays in adoption of XT from chicken little arguments and hand waving that don't have an actual demonstrated risk using numbers, those individuals are going to be summarily tossed out of the community.  
Never underestimate the community's capacity to ostracize people who act against the group's best interests.  Anyone who owns bitcoin isn't going to let others hurt its value for very long.  If someone pushes this this too far there will be a very long queue of people lined up to burn their posteriors at the stake, speaking figuratively of course.

Anyone who advises, owns, or works for groups that are building competing or complimentary protocols should recuse themselves from the discussion.  That includes anyone working for blockstream, companies working on zero confirmation schemes, side chains, and alt coins.

Bip100 adds complexity because it can lower or raise the limit.  If the spec is modified so the cap can never go down and the frequency is faster than every 3 months, then it could be done safely.  You can game bip100 right now if you control a little over 20% of the mining to choke the network and force an exodus to a competing cryptocurrency or scheme.

Totally, Moore's law keeps going and going.  Sure there are theoretical limits, but those break too.  It will be quantum spin liquids or some other technology and we'll be back in business.   
Ideologically, I think we should build bitcoin to be as good as it can be at being *bitcoin*.  
2.0 ideas and side chains need to survive on their own merit.  Their supporters should focus on getting real, working versions live, not forcing bitcoin into a dead end so they can "save" it.  It's getting ridiculous.  At some point soon the only solution is going to be to attack them directly.  They aren't leaving many alternatives open.
Everyone should just support the 8mb x 2 every 2 years approach.  BIP100 and other moving average or voting based limits introduce the potential for too many unintended consequences.  We are making this FAR more complicated than it needed to be if we were just focusing on the computer science.  It's become a political circus.

It's not a strawman at all.  I'm pointing out that the 8mb doubling every ~ 2 years doesn't introduce any new dynamics to bitcoin that aren't there already.  It changes a fixed cap to a variable one that grows at a fully predictable and transparent rate.
Voting on size every ~3 months and normalizing the change sounds better, but it introduces a new dynamic, voting.  This creates the potential for unintended consequences if it doesn't control for issues that we don't even know exist (such as the giant hole I just shot in BIP 100 above, for example).
So yeah, KISS is 8mb x 2 every 2 years.  Voting is with normalization sounds better, but only if you are a Pollyanna who doesn't think about unintended consequences in complex systems.  Voting introduces new variables, there are more opportunities for the devil to get into the details.  
So yeah, no on BIP 100 as proposed.  Go test it in an altcoin.  Yes on the 8mb cap with growth doubling approximately every two years.  It has a lower probability of breaking things, or making the protocol vulnerable to schemers who are looking to promote their own protocol and don't mind hurting bitcoin in the process.

Bitcoin's Myspace moment.  Catchy...
Except bitcoin isn't a social media website.  It also isn't a web application.  Bitcoin isn't software either.  It's a protocol.
[Bitcoin transaction rates have grown steadily and are now testing the 1mb cap.](
There is a cost and no economic incentive to run a full node, it is less than simple to get the reference client accepting more than 8 connections through most routers, yet thousands dealt with the clunky software and run full nodes every day. Storage space isn't even the biggest hurdle, it's the current software.
Now You can call this volume "fake", assume it is "real", or claim the number of nodes could be more, but it's completely irrelevant.  The volume is there, we have an extremely well thought through contingency plan to deal with it (relative to past changes) and need to do something now.

First the math above is sloppy and wrong.  4096mb happens in 2034 not in 2036.  There reality is block times average just over 9 minutes not 10, so that level is hit earlier than 2034 even with corrected math.
Your question is what 4gb solves that 100mb doesn't?  I have no idea.  Why?  Because we have demand right now for around 1mb blocks during peak volumes.  I have no idea what use cases will exist when demand is at 100mb or 4gb, so hypothesizing about that is an exercise in hand wavy theory crafting.  
Look, this stuff might sell to VC firms, but gumming up incremental improvements to the Bitcoin protocol over this stuff is wreckless and does more harm than good.  Even bip100 introduced all sorts of new dynamics and details that could be exploited.  Gavin's proposal solves the immediate needs, makes the majority happy, and gets the focus back on harder problems.  This debate has long since jumped the shark and people are starting to get really angry.  And they should be.  Pretty soon it's time for the torches and pitchforks.

If someone shot you in the stomach, and you are losing blood, you don't tell the EMT in the ambulance to not give you a blood transfusion, because the "solution" is to have surgery to remove the bullet and sew the hole in your stomach. You need the transfusion now or else you'll bleed out and die before you ever make it to the operating table.
The problem here is your definition of "solution".  Raising the cap is a solution, because at current transaction growth rates, we're going to be hitting a point of congestion very soon.  20mb delays this well down the road and prevents exsanguination before we get to the operating table.  
I have the same issue with the term "legitimate".  These are academic arguments.  We need to do something soon to address a short term problem.  This is a legitimate concern, and is separate and distinct from a longer term solution.  Kicking the can down the road is fantastic sometimes, especially when the alternative is worse.
[I threw out the 40% compounding block limit increase aligned with difficulty increases eight months ago before it was proposed by anyone else, so I absolutely prefer a scaling solution that follows a curve safely under extrapolated historical bandwidth growth rates.](
I'm not going to fixate on the idea though.  The time for these ideas was 8-12 months ago, not today.  Raise it to 20mb and this buys time to work on 2.0 protocols or scaling block caps so we only have to deal with perhaps another hard fork one more time down the road.

Deflationary currency has nothing to do with it.  The majority of people don't know what the term "deflationary currency" means.  I don't see a lot of middle class people saying "oh bitcoin, no way.  that's deflationary.  there's a fixed supply so the value will go up, which makes me want to hoard it and not spend it."  
The issue is that new users aren't adopting bitcoin.  That's because there isn't a compelling reason for them to change their behavior.  Even if there was a compelling reason for them to change their behavior and use what is effectively a new currency with extremely complex technical underpinnings (a second currency is a concept that 90% of people can't easily conceptualize, leaving out all the bitcoin complexity), most would still not do it because it would require a change in their behaviors and habits.
Bitcoin will either take a long time to catch on (we are talking young people get old), or the amount of "learning" required to use it needs to drop precipitously.  I think the two biggest hopes for nearer term mainstream adoption are hardware wallet integrations to common computing devices, and using bitcoin as a form of currency across video games.
I would seriously put video games first in line too.  Video games are entertainment, but are also social learning experiences.  If Activision, Riot Games, and others were smart... they would load up on bitcoin and then incorporate it into their multiplayer games.  If you want to get bitcoin into the mainstream, it needs to become video game currency.  That's where it could take root fast.

Wow, I sound like a bitter old man.  
Bottom line, unless bitcoin is used exclusively as a exchange layer between other currencies, or exclusively in tiny amounts for micro-transactions, the current price is impossible to explain rationally.  With 14m and change bitcoin in circulation, the market cap is $3.5b dollars.  That's the low end range for a mid-cap stock.  
$790m in VC money have been put into bitcoin related startups, and that investment is accelerating greatly.
If you break down that $790m in VC money, the majority of it has been put into payment processors, exchanges, wallets, and hardware plays.  Most of these companies succeed only if bitcoin is used as a form of currency AND they are successful.  
The financial services industry, and by that I mean all it (all types of banks, exchanges, hedge funds/ investment companies, brokerages, tax and accounting systems, payment rails/networks, government regulatory bodies / public costs) costs a LOT of money.  If you consider all of the costs, it's conservative to say that it consumes 10% of the world's productive capacity.
Bitcoin offers the potential to automate out most of the economic costs of the present financial system, which has about 10% friction with externalities like fraud (using this term very broadly), so why would VC's invest $790m in a system that's only valued at $3.5b?  VC's have invested over 22% of the entire market cap of bitcoin in companies that mostly offer services and technologies that will only be profitable if bitcoin use grows.  
If the price stays at $245, just in terms of comparing and contrasting the size of traditional financial companies to world gross domestic product, those VC's are guilty of some seriously irrational exuberance investing so much in such a small pond.
If that's the case, we are in for a major correction, because these startups are going to start going bankrupt (especially mining companies), which will put downward pressure on the price.
If that's not the case, the price has to go up or else the VC money won't earn a reasonable return.  
I don't see room for a middle ground where the price stays where it is, even if there is intentional price fixing going on in advance of the CFTC getting up to speed or some other regulatory body jumping on this, perhaps prematurely.  [Bitcoin can't be manipulated as easily as a precious metal.](  Taking delivery is just too easy.
The price is either going to be much lower with another cryptocurrency taking the front position, or much (much) higher.  This is a temporary lull.  It could go on for years, sure, but it's absolutely not the end state.

If you concede to letting miners raise the cap, you should also let them lower it?  That's a textbook definition of the comparative virtue excuse ethical fallacy.  Something being equally or less bad than something else doesn't mean adding it won't make things worse.
8MB blocks don't add "massive centralization risk".  5 TB drives sell for under $120.  That's over 4 years at 20mb blocks, about $30 a year for almost 3 x the capacity proposed for the next 2 years.

At least two of those from your list are issues that do need to be addressed.  
Mining centralization is a problem.  When ghash.io hit 55%, we had previously been in a price recovery.  It tanked when that happened, confidence was shaken up, and things were set back. 
Blockchain size is another one, especially if we want to keep running a full node or non-pool mining accessible to hobbyists or small scale part time parties.

@_date: 2015-06-18 23:22:01


That is not an apples to apples comparison.  Miners can decrease the block size if they win a block.  BIP 100 allows them to vote with every coinbase for a new limit, and every 12,000 blocks / 3 months the top/bottom 20% values are tossed, and the most repeated minimum vote amount is used, which cannot exceed 2x the previous 12,000 block limit.
That's not the same thing as winning a block and choosing to put in fewer transactions.  This is a voting system where miners can influence the maximum block size accepted for a 12,000 block period for all miners.  
Making such a sloppy comparison is dangerous.  Let me give you an example.  Let's say I've invested, oh, I don't know, eight figures in side chains or 2.0 protocols.  I have friends who mine and make most of their income through the coinbase reward, not transaction fees today.  Maybe I control a pool as well and win 30% of blocks?  
What is to stop me from repeatedly voting /BV100000/ for a 12,000 block period, and getting 10% of the block votes for a consistent 100KB cap?  What if other miners are not consistent in their choices and choose 8000000, 7500000, or other values, and by sheer consistency I'm able to drop the block size limit well below what is needed to run the network today?  
Or maybe I play the long game, wait for 5MB blocks to become common, and then force the size down to 1MB in order to force a safety value effect.  I now create an incentive for users to adopt my now live and in production non merged sidechain to escape the now 3 month log jammed bitcoin, screw over the community, but make myself incredibly rich as all the bitcoin money becomes demand for my own cryptocurrency?
Now we need a floor to prevent attacks in the other direction.  Dynamic block limits are not fully baked.  The people coming up with these ideas are a hell of a lot smarter than most of the people in this sub, but advocating them is dangerous.  
I think an 8mb cap doubling every 2 years is the safest, simplest solution. It doesn't create new influences by network participants/miners that we haven't possibly figured out.  Voting is a new dynamic.  It's unprecedented.  Pilot it in an alt-coin and come back here with a case study.  BIP 100 isn't ready for production bitcoin.  There are too many gotchas.

Time already has told.
Gold has been considered a store of wealth in almost every culture that had access to it again and again over thousands of years, including cultures that had no interaction with each other.  The meaning of the phrase "intrinsic value" has nothing to do with it, and the assertion that its valuation is subjective is a convenient oversimplification.
Subjective?  Yes, subjectively decided independently by billions and billions of people over time in vastly different cultures all over the world.  This thought is repeated as if this subjective valuation was some person who decided gold had value and can be turned on of off like a light switch, and not both a recurring trend and a belief system deeply held in almost every major Country, and vehemently in China and India to the point where it is intertwined in religious belief and deeply steeped in culture, just to name a few.
The simple test is, if you had five pounds in gold bars sitting on your coffee table, would you put them out on the curb with a sign that says "free", you know, because the phrase "intrinsic value" has no meaning?
If you are right and I am wrong, why does gold trade for value on open exchanges?  Also, how many ounces of gold have been mined from asteroids to-date, and what is the cost per ounce of mining an ounce of gold from an asteroid?  
Bitcoin has intrinsic value as well, because people believe in it.  It serves unique purposes that gold or paper cash can't accommodate.  Schiff is very wrong about bitcoin.  Even so, stating that the term "intrinsic value" needs to die and getting frustrated because people value gold is silly, academic elitist foolishness.  Gold is part of human history and has outlasted every other empire or Country that has issued a currency.  Taking the other side gives you a very high probability of being wrong, and I don't think there are many gold asteroids landing in India and China anytime soon.

If governments mandated closed loop systems there would still be leakage into free systems, but of enough of these closed systems overlapped, there would be a tipping point where unidentified transactions would be conspicuous.  This could create an exodus to a more anonymous altcoin, or enable levels of surveillance so excessive that they meaningfully distort economic decisions to the point of it being deleterious to growth and prosperity.  Bitcoin is a global public ledger, just think about it.  I would like to avoid those outcomes.

[You can always can sign up for our US beta test for Novauri.](
It's US only to start, beginning around April 2015.
We also need to comply with regulation, but because of our design we never have the ability to freeze or seize your assets.  The service will also work with any address you register to your profile for buys (and receives).  We KYC you, not your choice of wallets.
For what it's worth, I don't know the particulars of the situation with Coinbase, and I'm a bit skeptical about some of the hyperbole, but I can tell you our policies are transparent.  You can read them on our website.  
Typically if your identity or your account information is on one of many lists, or doesn't belong to you, we may have to not let you use our service or take other action.  We cannot do business with you if you are using the funds to launder money, break various laws, or buy illegal items.  If you mention to us that you are using our service to buy illegal drugs, well, we have to report you to the Treasury and law enforcement, for example.  Our personal views on drug law in the US are irrelevant; if we don't comply we go to jail.  Pretty simple.
What we do not plan to do is monitor your use of bitcoin after it's in your personal wallet, or track you like some kind of surveillance service and see where funds move once they are out of our hands.  There is no clear law about this type of activity as a requirement and we feel that such activity would potentially open our company up to liability, as we do not own or control these accounts, and have no legal right to monitor or control their use.
Besides, the blockchain is public.  If law enforcement or regulatory bodies wish to monitor this type of activity they don't need our company to do it.
Again, I am skeptical that these issues are 100% coinbase's fault though.  Seems like a bad decision for business.  Having trouble buying that it was 100% their call.  If I was a betting man, I would say it is much more likely the people affected were already in trouble with the law in some way.

* Don't place a lot of "trust" in Novauri
* Keep 100% control of your own private keys easily and transparently
* Don't pay for extra security and insurance because it's unnecessary
* Get a better deal
Yes, so maybe plan B is better?

[Remember, Western Union's William Orton also laughed at the telephone, refusing to buy the patent for a paltry sum.](
Yet Western Union went on to launch the first commercial satellite into space in joint partnership with the US military, and continued to serve as an extremely innovative force in technology during the middle of the 20th Century.
Most companies die when they are faced with a superior technology that they didn't invent.  Western Union is one of the few exceptions.
They were hit with the telephone, and reinvented the telegraph into a money wire system.
When they were hit with email, the telegram system folded, but they diversified and focused on other work.
Western Union is probably the most conservatively run company that you can think of, and they certainly aren't what I would call risk takers, but don't count them out of the fight.  New technology doesn't usually kill off old technology, we still have cash, lanterns, horses, and courier services, after all.

You seem to have something against blockstream.  Look, I agree that sidechains are no where close to fully baked, but I don't see how an offramp to a competing currency via sidechains is any more dangerous to core bitcoin as if I had created NC ^TM as a true altcoin, e.g. Ethereum.
The net of it is, NC ^TM would have demand, and people would sell bitcoin to fund purchase of NC ^TM.  This is no different from how Ethereum sold ether in return for BTC.
All of these things would impact the price of bitcoin negatively, lower the economic incentive to mine bitcoin, and have all of the other deleterious effects that brings with it.  
I think sidechains with merged mining helps bitcoin.  I think sidechains with non-merged mining is as damaging as an altcoin that doesn't use merged mining, but I do not see how it is worse.  Maybe I don't get it, but it just feels like a gimmick.  I think they are equally damaging.  If you can convince me otherwise, please do.

Henny Penny, more commonly known as Chicken Little and sometimes as Chicken Licken, is a folk tale with a moral in the form of a cumulative tale about a chicken who believes the world is coming to an end. The phrase "The sky is falling!" features prominently in the story, and has passed into the English language as a common idiom indicating a hysterical or mistaken belief that disaster is imminent.  It's thought that Henny Penny may be distantly related to the boy who cried wolf.
The TV personality analyst guy who impulsively exclaimed that the price of bitcoin would collapse if it ever gained mass acceptance was unintentionally  and momentarily Henny Penny claiming that the sky is falling.  
The point being, skies don't fall, and prices don't collapse when you are pricing them in the thing that you claim is going to collapse.  Ten divide by one is still 10.  Bitcoin isn't a more efficient means of exchanging fiat currencies as the TV personality mistakenly believes.  Given time, it's a vastly superior and stable replacement.

Where is the github repository containing the code that determines how many redundant copies of an encrypted chunk of data exist, how that works for data stored over longer periods with infrequent access, and how fees are derived from this information?  What is the proof of work system that confirms that a chunk of data was delivered upon request and that a node should be paid?  
I see claims for maidsafe of near instant confirmations, much lower / no fees, distributed ledger, no mining necessary / power efficient.  I have to say that sounds like bs.  I would like to see the Storj's codebase repository that makes up your blockchain.  Where is that?
How does storj deliver fault tolerance, especially for files that are accessed infrequently and stored for long periods of time?  What about really slow connections, or file chunks that are partially delivered but lose connectivity?  When is delivery achieved and payment due?  Where is the code for that?
How is the data encrypted?  How is that encrypted chunk identified and indexed efficiently so the network quickly can see how many copies are out in the wild?  How does the network know if a copy is actually there, is there a requisite heartbeat function, and how does that work without becoming a massive ledger?  Are the heartbeats effectively prune-able transactions to keep ledger size down, but how do we track payment due then?
Where can we see the code for these things?
Thank you.

No.  It absolutely doesn't prove "bitcoin solvency", whatever the heck that term means.
If my books say my customers possess:
*$150m in fiat deposits (total across all currencies and accounts)
*183,000 bitcoins
but one of my evil employees stole 100% of my bitcoin and fled to South America somewhere...
I can use my $150m in fiat deposits to buy back the 183,000 bitcoins, and pass the "audit" above with flying colors.
Now, I am also out of fiat, although my customers don't know it until enough of them try to take out their cash all at once, which may never happen.  If I can freeze up some accounts because of "regulatory requirements", those funds are off limits and can be counted as reserves, even if they are not there, so an aggressive KYC policy is mandatory if I'm in this situation.
I could even take out loans against collateral held in deposit and purchase the missing bitcoins wtih loans, which would be a less criminal thing to do.
A full financial audit of fiat and BTC balances, including any loans taken out by the company (their balance sheet) is what is needed to give some reassurance.

That's an awfully binary view of law enforcement.  I'll give you the rich and powerful get a completely asymmetrical amount of attention when their panties get in a bunch, but there are plenty of laws that are enforced in order to promote the greater good.
In this case, if there were shenanigans, it's important to crush those involved and send a clear message.  If that doesn't happen, sociopaths will rush in to fill the void.
And look it, it's entirely possible their CEO was just monumentally incompetent and had no experience in financial services.  If the guy did stuff like try to use USD deposits to shore up his business because BTC were stolen and cover it up, I wouldn't even hold that against him too much.  
Now, I find that exceedingly difficult to believe.  Any garden variety banking consultant is going to tell Gox they need to reconcile their bank and book balances, which would have revealed this "missing 744k bitcoin" issue LONG before it was 744k deep in the hole.

Fair enough...


Even the definition of intrinsic references gem stones and stars, one of which is arguably subjective and the other very much not.
It's easy to see how gold has intrinsic value, because it's physical, can't be profitably counterfeited, and has been valued over many thousands of years.
Schiff doesn't understand bitcoin, so he assumes it's a mobile telephone application that can be deleted.  He assumes it’s a fad that could go out of style, and be replaced by Bitcoin 9 or Bitcoin Yosemite.  He doesn't understand it as an iterative, living thing that is "out in the wild" and can't be put back in the bottle.  Bitcoin is decentralized, almost like a virus.  It’s something that isn’t going away and evolves around roadblocks.  This is something he doesn’t understand.
So unless the world was EMP blasted back into the stone ages, bitcoin is going to survive.  Even if someone cracks SHA256 and RIPEMD160 entirely, someone would simply recreate the blockchain using secure hash functions and it would rise again stronger.
Also, bitcoin has utility and value.  It's absolutely the only currency that works well for anonymous markets.  I am not taking any ideological position here, but I do believe that these markets are not going away (see Prohibition).  Bitcoin is also incredibly valuable for international value transfer.  This will catch on very soon.  It has great utility even as a payment mechanism in more mainstream channels too, although this is greatly overhyped by silicon valley and others.
Any time you have invulnerability and a demand, you have intrinsic value.  Schiff just needs to take a few computer science and biology courses.  He’s not quite there.
He also "talks his book" pretty rabidly, and sees bitcoin as competition when he should be seeing it as a complimentary entity.  I don't think he will get it though.  It isn't in the stars for him.

What?  non-HD wallets is NOT a security issue.


I'm so tired of reading about this silliness.  Address reuse is NOT a security issue in the context of other wallets on bitcoin.org.  Why?  Because that site lists wallets that have to comply with the BSA - which requires ID validation and data retention.  If you use any service that buys and sells bitcoin and keeps custody of your private keys, those companies are validating your identity and required to keep a log of your PI and account data (including all addresses used) for at least 5 years, 7 under SOX regulation (and most retain it indefinitely in practice).  
Any web wallet in fact isn't really going to be secure as it relates to address reuse.  The only time you should even worry about address reuse is if you use a local wallet where no 3rd party has a record of your addresses.  Then it can help you not make a mistake if you are trying to maintain your privacy.


And guess what?  Green Address and Hive also use javascript yet are listed on bitcoin.org.

Merged mining increases the complexity of mining, which favors pools which encourages centralization in mining, which is probably bitcoin's biggest vulnerability.  People tend to forget what happened when ghash.io hit 55%.  The price tanked.  Also, 50% of altcoins die after a 51% attack, the other 50% never recover.  That is the kind of shakeup that could really set crypto back, or be used to force an agenda to put it in a box.
Sidechains not using merged mining don't make any sense right now.  Why would you want just an SPV proof and peg lock period with no hash power from the main bitcoin network to back your sidechain?  It is trivial to 51% attack a sidechain running off their own blockchain, control the network for the lock period, unfreeze the peg, and bam, steal everything.  No one will hard fork or roll back bitcoin proper to save a side chain.  Unmerged sidechains have all of the disadvantages of an altcoin, without the option to hard fork around a 51% attack, or use full proof of work vs SPV.  
Sidechains are an awesome idea, but they are still an idea.  The problems around merged mining need to be solved for merge mined side chains.  The non-merged sidechains aren't there either to me.  There is a way to go here before this is viable and safe enough to really plug into bitcoin proper.

You have the trend backwards, there is a cycle between decentralized and centralized innovation and capitalization.
1) Mainframes + dummy terminals (centralized - 70s and 80s, wanes in the 90s)
2) Home computers (decentralized - 80s and 90s, waning to mobile devices in the 00s)
3) Centralized mega services (centralized - google, Facebook, et al 90s and 00s, will wane in the 10s)
4) Distributed applications and networks running on local user controlled systems (decentralized and happening now)
The trend has already reversed.  People just don't know it yet, but google and Facebook are realizing they are increasingly becoming boring and commoditized.  Overpaying for acquisitions instead if innovating is a sure sign that a company is struggling with its future relevance.  There is hope for your hardcore gaming...

It can work that way I suppose.  We're always going to create an address for you that is derived from information the customer enters into the site and knows that we do not know.  The customer is encouraged to download the key to the address.
You can use this address to buy, sell, send and receive.  When you log in after registration, you are able to decrypt the private key for the address locally and sign transactions.  Signing transactions are required for selling and sending.
What we also let you do is register OTHER bitcoin addresses.  Trezor addresses, paper wallet addresses, brain wallet addresses, addresses from other clients, other web wallets, we don't care.
Then, when you buy from Novauri, you can choose to have your bitcoin sent *directly* to any of these addresses.  
So it may be a matter of convenience where you don't have to log in and send the bitcoin from the Novauri address to another address you control, but systemically it's not just convenience.  We're making it easy for our customers to use alternative forms of storage, and we're also reducing the amount of bitcoin stored in addresses we generate for users.  That lowers systemic risk for both us and our customers.
So I guess the right way to say it is that it's not the only way it works.  We also have other models that won't be day 1, but will be available shortly after.  More on that soon.

Those are make believe numbers and you are missing some of the key underpinnings of how our fractional reserve system works.  
That's not a dig at you, it's not easy to understand by design.  I really love the table formatting.
The issue is that the number you are using to count 1, 100, 99, -10 are not fixed.  You need to add another column and call it "money supply" since we are keeping this high level.
Let's say in row 1, "money supply" is 500.  In row 2, it's now 511, because the Fed printed/created the 11 units of value.  The private sector who owns the Fed skims 1 of the 11 in your example, and teh government got 10 that it now "owes" the Fed.  
See, but the entire system of currency is now devalued.  There are more units out there making everyone else's' units less valuable.
In your example, specifically wholes number after row 1 is no longer worth 1, they are worth 0.9803921586...
And that's the secret of Fractional Reserve Banking and how the system works.  The more you know.

I run a bitcoin development project and your advice is naive and silly.  Take your life and affairs into your own hands?  What are you talking about?
If MasterCard or other interests are successful, bitcoin will never realize its potential.  It will be regulated at the points where bitcoin is exchanged for fiat or for goods sold by legally registered companies.  That regulation will be severe enough as to give it just enough competitive disadvantage that it cannot compete with the 1950s payment networks.
It only takes about 3-4% inefficiency to make that happen.  That's very easy to do.  Arguably the IRS already put the nail in the coffin.
Bitcoin development projects won't do squat if they can't compete on a level playing field.  I want to see bitcoin succeed as a currency and payment system.

What criteria were used to decide that blockchain.info was not "secure enough"?  Who made this decision?  Is this on record?
This seems like complete bullshit to me.  It's pretty clear that other competitors were aggressively smearing blockchain.info.  Coinbase was so brazzen they even made a public post that included a bunch of untrue statements about blockchain.info's security.  
Did anyone involved in this decision at bitcoin.org have any profit or ulterior motive to make a seemingly capricious decision like this?  
I think until this is clarified for the community it's time to ban bitcoin.org.  We should put up PSA's everywhere warning people that bitcoin.org is captured and potentially promotes wallets based on business relationships and unscientific personal biases.

Is your issue with synchronous or asynchronous 2-way pegs?  What are the issues, specifically?


That's not competing to mold bitcoin if they are building side chains for clients.  Side chains are pegged to bitcoin... but sidechains are firewalled from bitcoin proper.


Side chains can use merged mining or not...  if a client of this company prefers not to use merged mining, that's their decision.  I'm skeptical as to how a side chain using their own mining scheme would have a higher chance of success than the garden variety altcoins that fail all the time.


It's not so black and white.  If I create NovauriCoin^TM (I'm not doing that, by the way), as a sidechain, lock up, say 1,000,000 BTC on the peg, and start mining using an amorphous hashing algorithm that rotates scrypt, SHA256, and some other magic stuff I pretend invented in my basement that makes ASICS less viable, and decentralizes mining economics, and my NovauriCoin^TM takes off, great for me.  Does that hurt bitcoin?  Absolutely. I become an offramp to a new currency.  Will I be able to do this?  Absolutely not.  This wouldn't be one iota different than if I created an altcoin NovauriCoin^TM and sold NovauriCoin^TM for bitcoin just like Ethereum did on a website with Ether.  The fact that we're pegging bitcoin to NovauriCoin^TM has fundamentally the same market effects as if I asked people to give me Bitcoin in exchange for NovauriCoin^TM, and then sold the bitcoin on open markets.  The net result is the value of bitcoin would decline, (assuming I sold it), and NovauriCoin^TM would gain value, assuming it has new and exciting uses for people.
I actually think it's a net net of zero vs. today's alt coins.  The fact that my sidechain also has a pegged return value to the original bitcoin peg gives a floor or collateral to its value in bitcoin though, which creates a residual incentive to invest in the bitcoin currency.  The "insurance" for the value of my sidechain is denominated in bitcoin.  This is not at all unlike the cementing of the US currency unit as the world's reserve currency by requiring sale of petrol to occur in dollars, i.e. the petrodollar.  Again, if NovauriCoin ^TM goes bananas and everyone buys it with their fiat instead of bitcoin, this petrodollar effect diminishes, but the core developers of bitcoin can simply fork my NovauriCoin ^TM features into bitcoin core anyway, not unlike CounterParty just did with Ethereum!
All I have done with NovauriCoin^TM in the end was creating a parallel evolutionary track that benefited core bitcoin in the end regardless, and acted as a test bed. 


Above comments apply.

I've worked for years in financial services and can tell you without a hint of doubt that you are mistaken and need to reexamine your thinking on this matter.
Regulation is why money hasn't evolved technologically at the same pace as everything else.  It's why we are still using payment networks that not only predate the internet, but were designed in 1958.  That's starting to change now, which makes for very exciting times.
Regulators are not going to design or implement an efficient and effective way for users to store and keep their private keys safe.  What is far more likely is reactive policy in response to major service failures.  It's not their fault either, they don't have the tools to regulate effectively.  The issue with regulation is we are still using static rules.  You can't create a set of static rules, apply it to a rapidly evolving industry, and expect it to be relevant and harmless in 2 or 3 years, much less 40 years.  When a rule goes on the books, it is on the books.  It's like watching half of a sports event and being forced to plan out every play for the 2nd half without being their to witness what happens.  I think we have some amazing regulations on the books, given the tremendous handicap here.  Bottom line, the best regulation is going to be regulation that is NOT prescriptive and uses free market forces to encourage good behavior whenever possible.
E.g. don't legislate information security, require the firm to get insurance.  If they can't get affordable premiums, you now have a rule that will work long into the future.  
The biggest innovations around security lately are multisig, and those weren't brought to you by regulators.  We already have plenty of laws to enforce as it is.
Hint: most of the identity theft in the world is caused because of data retention requirements in the BSA and SOX acts, subsequently copied by other governments.  If we had been smarter, we could have gone with a centralized ID administration based on public/private key cryptography, or better yet a decentralized system.  Those ideas didn't exist or weren't possible when the regulations were written, but that's the thing about regulation, it doesn't update itself, and changing it takes an act of God (or perhaps just Congress).
Regulation is a snapshot in time, what is being regulated is very much changing and alive.  This is the root of the problem.

Do you know what I think?  And I shouldn't say this, it's completely inappropriate.  I think that some people are going to lose their $21m investment...
It's amazing to me how dumb some angels and VC's can be with their investments.  I guess it's the shotgun approach.  Look at the team, look at the names, look at the traction, and throw money at it.
SC's aren't fully baked.  They aren't going to happen, and there's no way in hell that anyone is going to make changes to bitcoin or hand over control to a group that is looking to make a return for a group of investors, at least if their proposal shows no concern for the integrity of the underlying parent system.
If they can demonstrate a sound, stable, and solid utility that helps or at least remains neutral to bitcoin, good on them.  Otherwise, it doesn't matter if their business objective was to create killer superintelligent robots who hate humans, they aren't going to meet their ojbective unless their proposal 1) is safe and 2) works in the collective best interests of bitcoin overall.  That can't happen if SC's lower the value of the parent protocol, regardless of whether that loss in value is through insecurity, devaluation through competition or inflation, or some combination.  
Bad for bitcoin and not shown to provide an increase in value to the original parent blockchain?  Good bye $21m investment money.  It simply isn't gonna happen as proposed anyway.  So my point is, why bother worrying about it?  Hopefully blockstream figures this out and repositions themselves somehow to be less controversial, or in a way that doesn't introduce security, stability or other concerns, or at least positions SC's as a net benefit over any perceived issues.  So far all I see is smoke, mirrors, and a white paper that has some serious unanswered questions.

Bitcoin isn't money.  You still don't get it.
Bitcoin is unique, digital information.  It is information that can exist out in the open on the internet, with no protection or firewalls, and yet cannot be copied for more than a few moments, 10 minutes at most realistically.
Think about this for a moment.  Movie and music industries, the entire banking sector, much of the legal system, voting. All of these industries or activities exist primarily to prevent copying or alteration of information.  All are potentially automated with bitcoin.  Micro transactions, currency for evolving machine learning ai, drone delivery charges. Remote holographic consulting services.  Free Global remittances.  The possibilities are mind boggling.

Here are a few thoughts on the proposal after a quick read.  You are creating a few dangerous barriers to entry and there is a huge glaring problem with the definition of virtual currency business activity.
* Section 200.2 Definitions (n) Virtual Currency Business Activity: 
This definition is dangerously broad.  You are creating a regulatory incentive for companies to host bitcoin, which is actually dangerous.  This is especially true in the context of Section 200.8 Capital requirements.  This is really not OK and needs to be restructured as TWO (2) types of definitions of activity with different capital requirements and standards.
Here is what I would suggest as a replacement for 200.2 (n) as (n) and (o):
**(n) Virtual Currency Retail or Investment Banking Activity** 
means the conduct of any one of the following types of activities involving New York or a New York Resident:
(1) securing, storing, holding, or maintaining custody or control of Virtual Currency on behalf of others where the entity retains the ability to control depositor's virtual currency (i.e. controls private keys)
**(o) Virtual Currency Retail or Exchange Services**
means the conduct of any of the following types of activities involving New York or a New York Resident:
(1) receiving Virtual Currency for transmission or transmitting the same;
(2) buying and selling Virtual Currency as a customer business;
(3) performing retail conversion services, including the conversion or exchange of Fiat Currency or other value into Virtual Currency, the conversion or exchange of Virtual Currency into Fiat Currency or other value, or the conversion or exchange of one form of Virtual Currency into another form of Virtual Currency; or
~~(4) controlling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency.~~ 
**NOTES:** ~~(4)~~ This line is redundant with securing, storing, holding, or maintaining now under (n).  It could also be construed as mining or creating a new virtual currency.  There's no need to protect NY residents from people who want to mine bitcoin or create their own virtual currency on their home computer.  This line does nothing but stifle invention.
(n) should have very significant capital requirements.  These are the businesses that pool bitcoin and can be hacked like gox.
(o) entities are not acting like banks, and are effectively ecommerce merchants buying and selling bitcoin, and transmitting it to the customer, relinquishing control.  These entities don't host bitcoin.  They should be exempt from capital controls and many of the requirements for (n) type banking entities.  They should effectively be treated as a merchant with some extra KYB, but be regulated mostly under FinCEN and not the State.
Then every subsequent section should be bifurcated into these two groups.  You have bitcoin banking entities and bitcoin retail exchange activities.  The two should not be treated as one.  Bitcoin banking is risky for businesses and customers because Gox may happen if an employee is shady or hacker is talented.  Bitcoin exchange or ecommerce entities don't host hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoin and remit funds to customers as orders clear.  Remember, bitcoin isn't at all like fiat deposits in a bank.  It's a shared ledger with calculated balances sent to addresses controlled by private keys.  Your regulations pretend that some participants won't want to use services that allow them to control their bitcoin using private keys they retain or use individual services to control, like keeping cash under a mattress.  That is completely unacceptable and leads to a very bad place where bitcoin becomes just as inefficient as current payment systems.  The digital cash aspect of bitcoin is a major component of why it trades at value on the free market and why it has so much promise in terms of microtransactions and new payment systems and models that accommodate tiny purchases and sales.  Don't put up a huge wall on that for goodness sake.  Trust me on this one...
I'll call out a few other sections that stick out as a red flag, but the entire thing needs to be re-written to allow for lower requirements depending on whether a company pools funds and keeps control of private keys.  Controlling customers' bitcoin and maintaining key control are the measurement criteria for bitcoin banking activity.  These are your risky businesses.
* Section 200.5 Application fees: You are creating a small barrier to entry.  Almost not worth mentioning.  
* Section 200.6 Action by superintendent: I like that you have defined a turnaround time of 90 days.  I think you need more definition around your measurement criteria for approval.  You also need to be transparent on your rulings from applicant to applicant.  The results should be public so as to make the process transparent and less prone to corruption or cronyism.
Section 200.8 Capital requirements: This again is creating a significant barrier to entry for small companies.  Please do not lump all virtual currency companies into one bucket and slap multi-million surity bond requirements on them.  This is sloppy, machete work when you should use a scalpel.  It's simply not acceptable as written.  
Split this into requirements for (n) Virtual Currency Retail or Investment Banking entities and (o) Virtual Currency Retail or Exchange Services.  (n) should have requirements and be required to carry insurance.  (o) should not have requirements like these at all.

Yes.  Efficiency isn't about just technology.  Bitcoin requires miners.  Banks require 10% of world GDP to pay for their salaries and the costs of their vendors.  Bitcoin scaled to the world population in 10-50 years isn't going to eat up 10% of world GDP in order to provide sufficient incentive to miners.  It's very likely that in 10 years anything that heats something else using electricity and can communicate with the network will be mining a cryptocurrency, so there are efficiencies here as well.

You don't understand their statement because these people don't know what the hell they are talking about.
Bitcoin is a decentralized information ledger and network, that, because of a novel invention, allows network participants to prove ownership of information in the ledger without requiring a central authority.
The IRS is concerned with the currency aspect of bitcoin, in that particpants control transactions sent to an address that they control with a private key.  
The IRS should treat it as a foreign currency if they need an analogue. If they want to be smart, they should treat it as an asset, but exempt small transactions from reporting requirements as with a foreign currency.   They absolutely should not have made the rules retroactive.  The new rules should go into effect 1/1/2015.  This created a surprise liability for many people, and some have no way to determine cost basis, what with Gox.

Quite a bit, actually, but it's still not a final list of measures.  There's more that's not here as well, but we haven't written it up.  Most of what is missing is related to transaction and account take over risk management, as well as regulatory and compliance processes which we need to fully disclose.
Here's a starting (draft, temporary) list (non-technical):
**Novauri Design**
* Novauri does not have access to your funds, bitcoin or fiat.
* No corporate "hot" or "cold" wallets for hackers or insiders to steal.
* Two-factor authentication is mandatory for all accounts.  Period.
* We enforce a high level of password complexity for our users (sorry about that).
**Novauri Applications, Codebase, Databases, Partners, Systems**
* Back office wallets used to send or receive bitcoin to and from customers are 100% separate from our online service, intentionally.
* Encrypted private keys stored on our servers use AES-256 encryption (not final).
* Although Novauri is not vulnerable to "hot" or "cold" wallet theft, we still use database technology that is suitable for banks anyway (i.e. no state/concurrency vulnerabilities, modern DB and DBA suitable for financial platform).
* We force the use of SSL / HTTPS site-wide.
* Passwords are never stored on our servers.  They are hashed, salted, and stored securely.  (not final - more to come)
* Our network topography follows best practices for financial services products (e.g. credentials/certs are not stored on app server or mon/non-mon DB) (not final)
* Service passwords are reset on a regular basis, are never shared, and are always complex.
* Customer data required to meet regulatory requirements but not required for the service are stored offline (air-gapped). (not final - more to come)
* We follow a disaster recovery plan, our software &amp; hardware is geographically dispersed, concurrent, and fault tolerant.
**Novauri Employees and Processes**
* All best practices for web application and database logic are followed.
Our codebase is subject to regular independent infosec audit and code review.
* We enforce separation of duties: developers cannot commit code to production, code is tested and approved before release
Formal release processes are used for production code impacting transactions or personal information, no exceptions.
* All employees are subject to criminal background checks.
* "Control" employees (employees with "keys" to a production system or authority to release changes) are subject to 
more rigorous background checks, including State and Federal checks as required by regulation.

You are saying that the private banks give back their 6% dividend and interest on their 3% capital deposit that they now earn to the Government as charity?
Sorry, that doesn't happen.  The system operates at a net deficit.  The Government can never repay all its debt via taxation, because the money in circulation including what it spent can never exceed the debt incurred to create it, because of the 6% and interest on deposits earned by member banks.  Your simulation is flawed.

You didn't even cite any references!  What, did you read "Who Really Pays the Taxes"? and haven't quite shaken all the teenage angst? 
The average home size in the US from 1973 to 2010 increased over 40%, while the median household population decreased from 3.11 to under 2.5, meaning 70% more "elbow room" for people today vs. 1970.
It's pretty easy to cherry pick facts and make extrapolations without any proof.  I was actually alive in the 70's and old enough to remember the very end of the decade.  Standard of livings are better.
Also there were huge demographic shifts in the last 40 years.  In 1970 the US was over 85% white, college education had a higher standard than today, etc.  
Trying to make these silly comparisons is folly, and claiming we haven't have an improved standard of living is absolutely ridiculous.  I can tell you are a middle or upper middle class kid whose parents supported his or her education.  It's like a giant neon sign.   You had best consider some other perspectives, you've been brainwashed.

We do, we are working on a page called "the details" or "the gory details", name still tbd.
Here's a quick summary:
**Topography / Infrastructure**
* Backend &amp; frontend separate and firewalled, all behind firewall and FF proxy.  Possible HSM for back part of backend - still TBD - may be overkill as we do not handle private keys.  DB not vulnerable to concurrency issues, etc.
* Backend accessed by frontend via services.  Same services to be packaged and exposed to partners that want to use us as a service for their web or desktop wallets (phase 2).
**Wallet generation**
*4 methods - different release timing.*  
* Method 1: priv key generated via javascript in browser (standard password storage service approach - encrypted priv key stored on service side, decrypted locally.  Send and sell transactions signed locally in browser using javascript (but only after auth + 2FA)  Buy transactions can be sent by Novauri to any registered address, we don't care which.
* Method 2: partner API - use salt + user entered data to generate a string, pass string to partner who manages wallet - same as 1, sends and sells are triggered via API - receives / buy are agnostic (we may not do this as it relies on a 3rd party a bit more than we like, it would have to be the right partner or use multisig)
* Method 3: not at launch - Novauri is backend.  Partner manages wallet, we act as a backend exchange - just meet regulatory requirements, register bank/2FA, and let the partner act as front end for wallet services.  Available via OAUTH2 cattlechute or API.
* Method 4: (not available day 1) Multisig version of Method 1.  Javascript signature and mobile app signature required from customer to sell or send.  3rd key would be retained by Novauri just for wallet recovery (if phone or login was lost).  Lose both, you are hosed.
There's a lot more, but that's the high level.

Yes, I really think that it will.  Have you tried to set up your own merged mining setup recently?  You are the pool admin.  You have to merged mine or you will be less profitable than pools.  Namecoind crashes, have fun waking up in the middle of the night, now multiply this by 10 or 100.  
Software is either nonexistent, full of bugs, or plain outdated.  The extra complexity will hurt your uptime.  You now have to run a full node also, which is not the case for pools, so your hardware costs just increased.
True a lot of this could be solved if the software was better maintained, far more accessible, and even remotely user friendly or documented, but it isn't.  So yes, it will contribute to mining centralization.  That's not even up for debate.  Try it and see how it goes for you competing against pools if you do to believe me.

Edit: I wrote this freehand tonight as I posted it so no, it's not the same submission.  Are you referring to the subject line of the post?
I post a lot more than 3 times a month.  I probably plug Novauri once a week.  It usually is popular too.  People are very supportive of the idea of a brokerage that doesn't control your bitcoin.  If that wasn't true, then why do the posts hit the front page 50% of the time?  It's not like we have a lot of seed money to spend on marketing departments of fake upvotes.  I don't even think that's possible, reddit has some pretty fancy stuff going on under the hood.
Speaking of posts though, if you compare the number of posts I make about our business to some other services, we're probably doing 1/10th the volume of the other guys.  Especially if you go back a few months.  We're not even in the same league.
Plus, I'm actually here for a reason.  I need beta testers.  We need a few hundred more to have a good enough population to use in our beta test period.  That group has to be a relatively representative sample of our actual customer base, and include a few fraudsters too for good measure.  We're pretty close, and I would like to close it out.
I post, people support Novauri, some upvote, some downvote, and that's all there is to it.  That's how reddit works.  I'm not sure how that makes me a bad guy.  I'm trying to build a service that give people options and gets bitcoin a bit closer back to being decentralized digital cash again.  Do you feel that other similar services were leading the charge in offering decentralized services?  Until very recently, you had no option to control your own keys at similar services.  Our entire business is built around that concept, and I feel it's going to become the norm in the future.  We've absolutely got peoples attention and are forcing them to support these types of demands going forward, because if they don't, we will offer them.  
So yeah, damn right I'm going to be talking about it on reddit.  It's what I believe in and what I do.

Can't argue with you there, but let's be completely honest.
We have a "wild west" environment with bitcoin; it's not anarchy -- but it's pretty close.  
So with our "wild west" there is no shortage of sociopath criminals starting phony businesses that are essentially marketing wrapped around traps for stealing depositor's bitcoin.  I'm sure some of them are smarter than this fellow and are playing the long game as well.  
On the other side of the equation, these criminals still enjoy the protection of the legal system in whatever Country they call their home.  
So we have an asymmetrical situation on our hands.  Sociopaths can operate with impunity and steal, but our ability to fight back is limited by legal protections that these scoundrels enjoy.
I'm not advocating this in anyway, and I mean it, but imagine how the tables would turn if vigilantism was allowed?  
Your statement that:


that statement presumes that the issue is that this crook's business was not regulated.  
Well, what if your presumption is part of the problem?  What if the problem is that the legal system is too antiquated and slow to deal with these snakes, and we need a fair, but much swifter, more direct form of justice?  
I'm just pointing out that you really need to consider both sides of the equation for your statement to be balanced; right now I don't feel that you're there.  
@_date: 2014-10-24 16:51:54
Haha, no we don't go bankrupt.  
If a bitcoin is worth $25, then people will just buy and sell much more of it; i.e., the principal value denominated in fiat will remain constant per trade.  As long as the dominant economy is fiat based, the price of bitcoin is pretty much irrelevant to a business making profit on a % of principal model.
The price does correlate positively to the market size and trading volume though, but frankly there isn't much real competition and our design is extremely lean.  These types of businesses have very high up front costs, but running them mostly scales with transaction volume, so we can survive during droughts pretty well, actually.
Now, that's true until bitcoin or some 2.0 version of bitcoin becomes a self sustaining economy.  At that point, my services will gradually no longer be necessary and I will happily fade into the background.  We would be dead at the point that sovereign currencies are no longer used, and governments (finally) modernize their financial systems and throw out their 19th and 20th Century static regulations.  I don't see that happening for at least 25 years, more likely 50 years from now.
It's not like we don't have any ideas for things to do if/when crypto becomes a self-sustaining economy either.  If you need a hint, please notice the name of the company is Novauri.  That's a compound word comprised of two latin words meaning "new" and "gold".  At the time, "gold" meant "money", so it means "new money".

There is no "then if I can't withdraw them" with Novauri.  
And no, we are not taking credit cards.  I always thought that was a ridiculous feature.  If I wanted to offer credit, I would build a reputation side chain and do on-blockchain microlending.  That would be cool.  Paying for bitcoin with CC is like buying stocks on CC.  Who does that?
If I was going to do a card product it would be PIN debit, or a card program with a multipurse tied to a bitcoin wallet using the backend of Novauri for BTC &gt; FIAT exchanges so the cash advance problem would not exist.  No one wants to pay those kinds of charges, and if they do, they either are about to get a nasty surprise or I am helping them make poor financial decisions, neither of which I particularly care to make the centerpiece of my service.

Newsflash: without the currency the blockchain doesn't work because there is no incentive to mine.  With no inventive to mine, you need a central bank.  With a central bank the blockchain is a bank database that no one has a reason to trust.

Don't believe the propaganda about inflation encouraging spending.  Anyone with the capacity to save money already moves their money out of fiat into stocks, real estate, bonds, etc.
People need goods and services to live according to the standards to which they are accustomed, and for that they will spend a deflationary or inflationary currency.
Economists who actually get the big picture (rare) like inflationary currency because they think the current system of monetary control over the world is best for most people.  I think there is a case for a system that has enough power to temper governments.

The exchange should not provide a receive address for deposits unless the customer has been validated first.  Why would they reveal the receive address, accept funds, and then require validation?  It's backwards and designed to steal money.
How many banks do you know that allow you to open an account without any information, deposit funds, then give you a surprise request for personal information that wasn't disclosed before taking your deposit, and finally keep your deposit if you do not give them your personal information?
None do that because it's clearly deceptive and designed to mislead customers and steal their funds.  The operators of that exchange are thieves and liars.

Do you think that chargebacks/reversals are free?  Do you think you don't pay for it when information is stolen?  
Hint: research the term "interchange".  The cost of almost everything you buy is inflated 3-4% because the credit card companies only pay out 96-97% of the value of an item sold when the customer pays with credit.  That 3-4% in large part pays for chargebacks.  So you are paying for everyones' chargebacks already.
Stolen information = tax fraud.  It's a multi-billion dollar problem.  Guess who pays for that liability?  Tax payers.  
Both cash and credit are horribly inefficient mediums of exchange, and you pay for that all the time.  You just don't understand how and why.  Hopefully now you do.

And they didn't reconcile or spot check to see if ledgers seemed out of balance for... years?
Bullshit.  
Listen, if their customer accounts had an aggregate fiat balance of $X in the bank but $Y on the books (i.e. their database record of customer usd balances) you reconcile that at least monthly.  You would notice if the total amount in your customers' accounts was much larger than in the bank.  
Now... If your software said you had X bitcoins allocated to customers' accounts, but your addresses had a much lower balance, you would notice that too.  Quickly.  
You think gox wasn't watching the numbers every day?
Yes, someone could make off with a lot of coins before it was caught, but not all of them.
This is theft.  If the CEO is really this monumentally incompetent then he should surrender himself to a criminal investigation and be 100% transparent with law enforcement in showing how this went down and where the funds went when.
I don't buy it, I think the CEO at least embezzled some/ most of the money.  This size of a loss would be obvious, if it was a huge, all at once theft that would be believable.  Not this.  Time for people to go to jail for international wire fraud amongst other things.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:00:29
First, yes it is theft because it has a market value.  It's also recognized legally as a currency or commodity in most major Countries.
Second, even if it isn't theft (which it most definitely is), do you know what is?  International wire fraud.  For example, Gox "confirmed" USD wires to my account back in October that never posted, and then never closed out the issue after you count the months.  I'm only out a couple of thousand bucks; I saw some writing on the wall about a year earlier, got a bad feeling in my gut, and took away my business.  Still, not everyone was that lucky.  There are people out (literally) millions.  Their CEO better get a facelift and head for a non-extradition Country FAST.
You know, I hate to say it, but he would be lucky to get the perp walk.  The longer he's on the outside, the higher the chance that one of the more unscrupulous of his customers will introduce him to the bottom of a river.  He's pissed off a lot of people, and some of them are of the rougher sort.

The cost of payment systems has nothing to do with the size of the ledger.  Do you know how many parties are involved in a credit card, debit card, wire, money transfer, and similar transactions?  Credit takes 3% out of all transactions and everyone gets a cut.  Federated ACH systems benefit from fractional reserve lending, which is arguably 5%+ of world GDP sucked out for no other productive capacity other than to move money and issue currency.  The cut is profit to keep millions (yes, millions) of people employed to deal with the mess from the inefficiencies.
Also, ledger size decreases with the scaling of storage capacity, which presently is halving every 12 months, much faster than Moore's Law.
To everyone in this thread, and not to be a jerk, but unless you have worked in the payments industry, you really aren't qualified to have an opinion.  I have, and let me tell you without a hint of doubt, bitcoin is far, far more efficient than older payment systems...

I think it depends on the individual.  That's a lot of money to most people, but not everyone.  
Also, I don't think it's cool to be targeting blockchain.info as "especially" a bad choice.  My guess is that they have about 25% market share, and more wallets than coinbase.   That's a lot of bitcoin.  The reused R value bug resulted in a tiny fraction of bitcoin being stolen, which is unfortunate, but not really that much.  More importantly, because they are designed to let the user control private keys, the issue was incremental, not catastrophic.  If a bitcoin bank-like service that controls most of the deposits has an issue with internal theft, that's an h-bomb, whereas this is a firecracker.  I'm sure they will fix their release processes so that critical code like RNGs will have a code review before release going forward.  That's easy to fix.  It's just implementing rules and taking away production credentials from developers.  They get over it.
 
Related to the actual attack that was used against blockchain.info, that's not something the other wallets could have defended against either.  I don't care if you have a 255 completely random complex password with 2FA, it would make absolutely no difference. 
That was an SSL stripping attack through a TOR exit node. This is where someone sets up a page that looks like blockchain.info, maybe has a lock favicon just like you would see at an https:// domain, but the page presented to the user on redirect is  The crook then establishes a real https:// session with the company, passing through the data the user enters in to the fake http:// site via this "real" https:// session.
This allows the crook to spoof the user, get their email, password, and most importantly, get a valid 2FA token - courtesy of the user who enters it into the http:// site, making all of the traffic visible to the crook.
This attack doesn't have to be through a TOR exit node, you can also set up a domain that looks *similar* to the real one, and pay to have the search results boosted in google or other search engines. The user may never know they are using a fake site at all.  Most don't, or so I'm told.
One of the few ways to stop this type of attack is through a page "signature" check that looks for discrepancies between how the page customers enter data into is rendered vs the known "real" page that the customer should be visiting.  There are 3rd party companies offering these services usually under the umbrella of "anti malware" (even though it's really not anti-virus, but plaintext phishing site detection), but they have a pretty high false positive rate.
So that attack was pretty sophisticated, and is one of the few ways there are to defeat 2FA. That attack would have taken out 99% of web wallet providers, assuming someone went through the trouble of setting it up. Blockchain.info was just targeted first, who did that is anyones' guess... although I'm sure there are theories.
That said, if you avoid TOR unless you use their .onion URL, or always type  into your browser (or bookmark it), you're pretty secure with 2FA and a little care to check the address of the site / certificate.  You also can use their browser extension if you want to avoid release problems with RNGs, etc.  So yeah, I don't agree that we all need to be hiding under a rock with our bitcoin.  For real safety, paper wallets &gt; Trezor.  I love the idea of Trezor, but that device is very new, and not at all proven safe.  Any point in the supply chain, or a crooked insider could make your bitcoin vulnerable.  I don't think that's the case, but for really big balances, nothing beats a paper wallet, especially with multi-sig.
I'm not a blockchain.info employee, by the way. I run Novauri.com, so I'm in the process of figuring out ways to stop these attacks before we go live next year.  I just don't think it's fair to bash blockchain.info.  They've received 100x the negative press for what amounts to a tiny theft from r-values, and an attack that would have taken down any bitcoin wallet service.

I agree.  No one talks about this anymore and by the time we realize it is a problem, the problem will be too large to solve.  It could be a sovereign power cornering the market on hash power, it could be an interest group that wants to see cryptocurrencies rattled so as to push for a new agenda, or it could be simple profiteering.
[We need to resurrect this discussion, perhaps without my embarrassingly self-serving closed beta brokerage promotion.](
The holy grail is making small scale mining more economical than industrial scale mining.  Combine that with a strategy to disincentivize or eliminate pools like two-phase mining.  Of course no mining group would agree to this direction.  I think it's a matter of small scale mining economics via heat recovery systems (the heat from mining used for heating or other small scale uses, subsidizing electricity rates for electric heaters that pay their coinbase and trx rewards to the utility company, perhaps)?  That's a little far out there, and might only work in BitcoinVille right now.

First, there's no reason you should be surprised.  Second, you can't possibly know that the funds I've referenced are a safer investment than Bitcoin.  I guess you could argue that bitcoin has been more volatile, but that's not the same thing as "safer".  
What if the currency that these funds are denominated in suffers a hyper-inflationary / deflationary spiral?  What if there is another depression, and a flight to cryptocurrency?  Major wars that shift the power of the governments or unions of governments issuing the underlying currency?
Personally, I think in the longer term, returns in bitcoin from today forward will outpace the S&amp;P 500.  The supply mechanics of bitcoin are based on math, and that determines the price to a large extent.  The equities you are espousing are denominated in currencies where the supply mechanics are determined by central planners.  Also the rate of taxation on c corporations is higher than bitcoin when you consider corporate and income double taxation.  No national currency has survived for many years.  All it takes is a major national crisis or war, and the currency is inflated away and sacrificed.  Heck, sometimes it doesn't even take a war, just irresponsible politicians and fiscal mismanagement (see Argentina).

Edit: we already had this discussion...  you showed me this thread:
Probably early onset senility.  Fantastic.  Just wonderful.  /edit
I think we had this argument last week or the week before on reddit somewhere.  Bottom line is BlockStream really doesn't have a fully baked cake at this point.  
Non-merge mined SC's are inferior to regular alt-coins in every way.  They are vulnerable to 51% and other attacks because they don't have the scale and infrastructure behind their mining, and if they are attacked, the option to hard fork is out - because the non-merge mined SC's units will have been unfrozen to bitcoin and are out of the SC.  Also, they only enable SPV level proof where a full alt coin could do much more.  I see non-merge mined SC's as, well, stupid.  Why would someone want to use one?  It's better to just go try and build yourself an ethereum and fund it on a website.
The only area I didn't necessarily agree with was that SPV offramps to merge mined SC's are bad.  
Say we have a two way peg to ScamCoin ^TM.  Alex Karpeles and Mark Green are partners and convince people to peg up 10,000 BTC over to the ScamCoin ^TM merge mined sidechain.  The convertibility of ScamCoin ^TM back and forth to bitcoin pegs it to bitcoin.  ScamCoin ^TM is backed by bitcoin, minus the risk in trusting Alex Karpeles and Mark Green's SC is safe.  
This is precisely like how the petrodollar is the world's reserve currency because all petrol / oil is traded on exchanges that only accept payment in USD.  This creates demand for the dollar, and cements it as the reserve currency of the world.  
Similarly if I want more ScamCoin ^TM, or to convert back to Bitcoin, I can do so freely.   Because the mining system behind ScamCoin ^TM is the same as Bitcoin, the infrastructure and hash power network effect are shared and symbiotic.
Where I would have a problem, is if the two way peg to a SC allowed the SC to create BTC - allowing more to reenter the parent network after being mined / created in the SC.  That's unacceptable and creates an inflationary leak into Bitcoin.  
As long as the SC cannot return more bitcoin than was originally pegged, I don't understand the big scary with the convertibility aspect. 
I do have issues with the approach for SC's.  I don't think the peg schemes are safe, I think there could be fraudulent transactions, and I think that even with an excessively long peg lock time (I may have the jargon wrong), there are still some valid concerns around forking.
I'm not really a huge fan of SC's, but I'm not scared of them.  They are vaporware right now, and if they ever got closer to not being vapor, so much would have to change that the big concerns about them would shift too.
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:58:16
That sounds awfully close to the "blockchain is amazing technology forget the currency" fallacy.
Cryptocurrencies are essentially positive feedback loops.  Their ability to decentralize is more powerful if demand for them is focused on one or two cryptocurrencies vs. hundreds or thousands.  We will see much more impact on technological evolution with one very powerful cryptocurrency than we would see with 100,000 altcoins running on linux boxes in kid's garages.  Just like decentralizing custody raises security, concentrating hash power and market capitalization in a few cryptocurrencies also increases security.
In order to compete with global payment networks and sovereign currencies, a cryptocurrency needs a massive network effect.  As long as the implementation of sidechains doesn't contribute to the centralization of mining in a deleterious way, or simply not make sense (as is the case with unmerged mined sidechains), I see them as a much more positive way to implement an alternative cryptocurrency.
I don't agree that it's about the early users who are whales protecting their own self interests.  I think it's a matter of appreciating the simplicity of bitcoin, it's robustness, and protecting what it is at its heart, unique digital information that cannot be copied, and solely for the reason that the information has value on the open market.  The higher the value, the safer the uniqueness of the information.  That's cryptocurrency at its heart.  I think you build on top of that as a protocol, you don't copy it.

Sorry about any confusion, yes initially Novauri will be US only.  There is much more detail on the about page.  It's generally a bad idea to start a service like this in many countries at once, there are too many rules, regulations, price differences, and moving parts.
No, I can't promise to offer you our services anywhere in the world or I would be dishonest.  We are illegal in Russia for example.  
We are doing the US first, perfecting the service, and then expanding based on where we see a market.  It's a blueprint I've used before and it works well.  Launching in multiple countries simultaneously is much riskier and gives you a high probability of failure, unless you are taking credit cards and calling that "international", which we do not plan to take for payment.

Use exchanges to buy and sell amounts you can afford to lose.  Never store large sums of bitcoin or fiat on exchanges.  Take your funds out ASAP and put your bitcoins where you control the private keys.
Why is this so hard to understand?  Until an exchange offers deposit insurance products by a company like AIG, it is a risk to keep funds in their accounts or addresses.

I feel like this was paraphrased from a marketing brochure for threatmetrix or iovation.  Do you have experience building and running websites that receive online payments for irreversible products?  Which companies, exactly?  
I do have experience, lots of it, and at the companies with the nastiest exposures to fraud.  You haven't read my site.  You insinuated that we were a bitcoin honey pot and stated you would be skeptical until you saw that you could “withdraw” your bitcoin from our service.  Yet all of our work and the primary motivation for building Novauri in the first place was to give people full control of their funds and private keys.  Read: there is nothing to withdraw; we are not a bitcoin bank.  Clearly you haven’t researched our design, or done google searches about me or my team, but are making some pretty caustic statements about our hard work and throwing in a few personal attacks for good measure.   I welcome criticism and intelligent debate, but I am not going to respond to additional posts by you if you are obviously trying to smear me, trolling, or making personal attacks.
 
Yes, we will use available technology with partners and build our own, if we haven’t already.  “Neural networks” are meaningless marketing BS to me.  They are an execution of rules to reactively score something into a bucket, just like all of the other commoditized anti-fraud solutions to choose from.  The only difference is that some of the rules have their values scored by machine learning algorithms that are judging positive and negative correlations between individual values as well as multivariate data sets and metadata about these correlations over time. 
But guess what all of that fancy talk gets you? You still have a system that defends reactively.  It can only work after it fails to work, and the more it fails the better it prevents failure.  It’s just smarter about learning from its mistakes a little faster.  You still need a fraud desk, unless you know something no one else doesn’t.

Novauri is about offering transparency, safety, and simplicity made possible because of a fundamentally more efficient design.  
We believe very strongly that Bitcoin is supposed to be frictionless digital cash.  We're planning all of our long term goals based on bitcoin being unfettered by red tape.

Step 1) Make up a string of 32 alpha numeric characters or flip a coin 256 times to get a binary 256 bit value of 1's and 0's (heads and tails).  This is your private bitcoin key.  No, really.
Step 2) Bitcoin uses ECDSA, so find the public key 65 byte public key (1 byte 0x04, 32 bytes corresponding to X coordinate, 32 bytes corresponding to Y coordinate) 
Step 3) Run the 65 byte public key through a SHA256 hashing function - this spits out 32 bytes (256 bits)
Step 4) Run the 32 bytes that were spit out from step 3 through RIPEMD160, which spits out 20 bytes (160 bits) 
Step 5) Run the 32 bytes from step 3 through SHA256 again, just for good measure.  Spits out a different 32 bytes.
Step 6) Take the first four bytes that were just spit out from step 5, and stick them on the end of the 20 byte output from step 4 - this is a checksum value (24 bytes)
Step 7)  Add a single version byte to the front the 24 bytes in step 6 - you now have a 25 byte binary bitcoin address
Step 8) Run step 7 through base58 encoding to remove easily confused characters like 0 and O - and viola, you now have a common bitcoin address.
So it's a heavily hashed public key that corresponds to a private key.
You can literally make up your own bitcoin private key.  That is what a "brainwallet" is.  So yeah, you don't need a computer for bitcoin, you can carry money in your mind.  Weird eh?

Their company was named blockchain before the term became as popular as it is today.  It's only in the last year or two that the phrase "blockchain technology" was referenced so often by IT publicists that it entered the lexicon of mainstream technical people.
In fact, the original white paper never refers to blockchain or block chain.  Proof-of-work chain?  Yes.  Blocks?  Yes.  Chain?  Yes, separately.  
Blockchain.info made a smart move naming their company the way they did.  And remember, Coinbase is just as much a bitcoin term.  If the term coinbase became widespread, would you think they should change their name too?  I think both should keep their names, they are valuable domains.

Two thoughts.  
Thought one: The 10 minute confirmation issue will be solved via private transaction verification engines.  Merchants will simply run full nodes and develop custom client software to cross-check transactions to their inputs for double spending before blocks are confirmed, allowing them to lower or eliminate double spending risk very quickly, in seconds vs an average of 10 minutes.

Mass acceptance is going to bring the price crashing down?  He has bitcoin confused with something designed to be a transmission fluid for international transfers between different currencies and correspondence banks.  He's thinking ripple.
When Bitcoin gains mass acceptance seeing the price come crashing down will be like trying to divide something by one and claim the sky is falling.  Bitcoin will be the price.

It's not vaporware.  It's a simple standard that uses technology that already exists today.
The challenge is avoiding coinvalidation or similar approaches that risk linking leaked identities directly to cryptocurrency addresses in a public ledger.  Those approaches exacerbate existing privacy issues, encourage an economically unhealthy levels of surveillance, and generally will make things much worse that today, if you can believe that's possible given how many times the average person has now had their identity stolen and the other various shenanigans that keep popping up in the news.
We're not ready to publish the white paper, but it's been sitting around for a long time.  It's a little early for us to be moving ahead until there is a way to execute on it without creating coinvalidation, and the ability to do that isn't directly in our control and relies on adoption of other approaches for exchanging cryptocurrency that exist today in production, but are not ubiquitous enough to float a boat.

Net neutrality isn't a good thing.  Net neutrality is a necessary evil because access to the internet is controlled by duopolies or monopolies, and giving those monopolies additional power to control the speed of content inside their pipes would be disastrous.
It would be better if the monopolies and duopolies lost all of their regulatory entrenchment, the government's stacks of rules and regulations were abolished, and access to internet services was forced into a more decentralized, competitive environment.
If people had actual choices when accessing the internet, it wouldn't be a big deal if one or two of the ISP's decided to throttle content and censor, because there would be a dozen other ISP's who wouldn't, and would actively expose that the other ISP's were, ruining their brand and taking their market share.
We need forced decentralization and competition with our ISP's.  If we really can't have that, then yes, we need net neutrality.
What we really need is to abolish the FCC right after we break up the big ISP companies under anti-trust law and set up a model where small, innovative companies can compete with them.

That is not why bitcoin sucks.  The writing was on the wall with Mt. Gox a long time ago.  If you continued to use them that was your mistake.
Asking for "regulators" to do your thinking for you is not the answer.  Then bitcoin will really suck, because you will need to be a multi-millionaire to begin a start-up and pass a background check to transact, which also means every thing you do with bitcoin will be mapped to your identity and accessible to government agencies, or criminals who hack the databases of the exchanges or NSA.

You might want to read up on how thepiratebay is creating an alternative p2p internet featuring fake DNS and website addresses that are bitcoin public keys (i.e. bitcoin addresses).
Bitcoin addresses are a part of a new, decentralized tcp/ip model where the "internet" is hosted using a p2p network by users.  This was never an intention of bitcoin community or the original designers, but I think people are now starting to wake up to the magnitude of the bitcoin protocol invention.  People use things in ways the original designers never intended all of the time.

Your first sentence is true, but that is not how transaction malleability works.
Transaction malleability works by generating the signature for a transaction differently, and, in doing so, modify the hash without invalidating the signature and transaction itself (because the sig is part of the hash).  
Original and changed transactions are treated like double spends to miners and look exactly like double spend attempts, so every 10 minutes or so, one will be confirmed and one rejected as a double spend.
Mt. Gox claims they were fleeced because fraudsters would copy an original transaction early on in the network propagation, alter it, and them wait for the network to confirm the changed transaction and reject the original (a crap shoot, but call it 40/60 chances).
Then the crooks called their operations, claimed the transaction was "rejected" and demand a refund.  Their ops people would look up the transaction in the blockchain or their search tool via transaction ID, but because the sig was modified and hash was changed, they couldn't find the changed transaction, assume the transaction was rejected, and issue a refund.  
Of course the changed transaction was confirmed and the original was not, but they are both the same transaction, and the crook makes off with a 100% return.
So it's not that their running total got out of sync, it's that they were having their ops people look up transactions by hash, when the hash can be modified, and not realizing somehow that they were being scammed for over a year.
They should have reconciled their accounts from time to time and not used hash to look up transactions, as there is this known issue...

Both.  The detailed version is that there are four transaction types.  Buy, Sell, Send, Receive.
Buy: You can have bitcoin sent to any address you wish, including paper wallets, brainwallets, trezors, we do not care.  After your funds clear (4 business days for ACH debit, less for PIN debit - but we are still debating if this is there day 1), we send the bitcoin from your purchase quote to any address you register to your profile.
Receive: Same.  It's a watching only situation anyway.  Register an address to Novauri, bitcoin still works the way bitcoin works.
Sell: Very different.  No, you cannot sell from any address you register to Novauri.  Why?  To sell you have to send bitcoin from that address to a back office address in our company so we can sell of the bitcoin to make sure we do not go on margin.  To send the bitcoin from your address, you must have control of the private key for the address to transfer the bitcoin.  To accommodate this, we create a bitcoin address for you during your registration that is derived from information you enter (your wallet password).  The private key for your address is created in your browser using javascript.   We never see it in plaintext, even in transit.  We store your encrypted private key on our side, but always the encrypted version.   Then when you want to sell, you receive and decrypt the private key locally using your wallet password again, sign the transaction locally, and thereby move the bitcoin to our back office address where the sale can happen.
Now... we could allow you to sell from other addresses, but this would require uploading private keys to our site.  We want no part of that, that is not our business.  We leave that to other groups, and we do not want your private keys anywhere near our servers.  To sell, you must send bitcoin to your Novauri address created during registration, and sell from that address.  We aren't creating a "2 step" process where we email you a back office bitcoin address and you send bitcoin there, or similar.  It's just to darn clunky.  So that's sell.  Simple on the surface, but pretty damn complicated under the hood.
Send - same as sell.  You can send from your Novauri address using the same local private key decryption approach.  You cannot send from other addresses you have registered to your Novauri profile that could be used to receive bitcoin or buy bitcoin.
Long long long answer to question 1...
Now question 2...


No, we won't use a particular exchange.  I have no insider information, but I doubt coinbase does either.  The price tracking bitstamp doesn't mean they trade there.  
We are very transparent at Novauri, it's one of the things we put value on, so I have no issues at all telling you a bit about what we will do, stopping short of putting us at a competitive disadvantage, of course. Our plan is to maximize or FX profit without ever going on margin.   Our strategy will be to use a combination of least cost routing to multiple exchanges to offset brokerage orders direct to customers.  We also plan to participate in secondary wholesale markets in order to boost our exchange profits.  
Our business plan is to never, ever go on margin though, so we'll need to maintain a net positive balance on bitcoin in most cases, because customers buy slightly more on average than they sell (with lots of variation depending on the market direction).  We do not plan to do anything funny, like operate a derivatives market on pending orders for profit, although we may use bitcoin derivatives to hedge risk on net positive reserves to protect against market fluctuations on an as-needed basis.

@_date: 2014-10-29 17:36:31
Full disclosure: My name is Will, I founded Novauri, and our team is building a service that will compete (at least somewhat) with Circle.  
[Please SIGN UP for our closed beta test in 2015 here.  It's super fast, takes 20 seconds, and we'll guarantee no transaction fees for the life of your account.  Plus our rates will be highly competitive. Read all about it on the website!](
Now that the shameless self promotion stuff is out of the way, Circle is likely less to blame for your experience than you might think, and believe me, I'm the last person to defend my competition.
**It's probably not intentional and not 100% Circle's fault**
The deal is, the US bank secrecy act and other regs have VERY strict rules around businesses acting as "money transmitters".  "Money transmitters" are a form of "money service business".  To regulators in the US, the are somewhere between a normal business and a bank.  Authorities are always concerned that money transmitters could become a high volume payment rail for groups that are doing things which are illegal.  Being authorities, their job is to enforce the law, and regulators actually create regulations that are "interpretations" of the law, which gives them quite a bit of latitude in terms of their decision making ability and general power.  
My service publishes a brief, easy to read overview of these [strict requirements that bitcoin direct sale and purchase businesses must follow.  Just click this or the previous sentence.](
**What is really going on with Circle?  Just one man's completely uninformed opinion** 
Two things:
1) they didn't know what they were getting into by going into financial services; and
2) the are in reaction mode.
1+2 is clearly evident in the fact that they accepted credit cards, but didn't have the experience to check their MCC codes with MasterCard and Visa.  They ended up with a pseudo-cash MCC code (like a cash advance) because the networks decided they were selling a cash advance like product.  When you buy stuff on credit, and the network gives your product an MCC code in the pseudo-cash range (there are 4-5 types if I recall), it's not like buying a pack of gum.  Typically your bank will charge you a cash advance fee.  What's worse, you IMMEDIATELY begin accruing interest (not the next billing cycle) at a much higher rate than your normal purchases.  This is nearly ubiquitous with credit cards, because anyone withdrawing cash from a credit card is a higher credit risk, because, well, they are obviously strapped.
Well Circle either had no idea this was going to happen, or did the world's worst job notifying their customers.  They ended up having to reimburse their customers for the fees and costs.  I know that sounds complicated, but to someone who has worked in the business, that was a rookie mistake.  My point?  They don't have experienced upper/middle level leaders in that company from the FI industry.  Senior execs?  Sure, but they are stuffed shirts and don't remember what an MCC code is.  I'll probably be one of those guys in 10-15 years, so it's not a dig, just a guess.
Now... since they made that rookie mistake on cards, I bet they are fumbling through the regulation thing too.  They probably have very good, highly paid attorneys, but don't have anyone on staff who has the experience to know what to do quickly. 
They are also probably fumbling through fraud.  Taking credit cards for bitcoin is a lose/lose proposition for any business.  It's too easy to buy the information needed to make a credit card charge pass with a CIP verified account, and the reversal process favors the consumer, and the networks will pull your merchant account if you don't honor their ruling.  
People really don't understand how complicated and incredibly challenging fraud mitigation really is.  Did you know that I can visit the darkweb, right now, and buy tens of thousands of full data profiles with information from real people?  I'm talking everything about them, including their DOB, SSN, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, CVVs, full public record and private database files (for answering those "where did you go to highschool" questions).  Their primary email and password?  Absolutely that's included because these schmucks were socially engineered, phished on a data collection website, or the information was flat out stolen by an insider working at a bank who was really working for an organized crime ring, or told a "friend" who worked for organized crime how to exploit weaknesses in the bank's security from the outside...  These guys are so advanced they will even sell you a registered mobile telephone account that uses a socks5 proxy so it appears to come from the ID theft victim's home town!!!
**Mission impossible: stopping fraudsters**
How the @ do you stop a super smart criminal or network of criminals with employees working inside of banks and government agencies who has a victim's full personal profile and a registered mobile phone that looks like it comes from their hometown electronically?
Two ways.  
1) you figure out patterns that make you slightly less vulnerable than the competition, so the criminals just go to your competitors.   That's most companies' strategy.  It's my strategy, and not to sound like an egotistical jerk, but I've got strategies that are going to be years ahead of anything they can patch together with partners.
2) you go "old school" or "manual".  Make the send in billing statements.  Make them go through an arduous process.  Make a human being review their file for patterns.  Be a pain in the butt, so it's too expensive for the crooks so they go someplace else with their data.
Circle is trying 2 because they haven't figured out 1.  They absolutely are not harvesting data because they are bankrupt.  Their CEO and leadership is far too accomplished and reputable for a petty, chump change scam like that.  
Circle is desperately trying to 'learn as they go'.  It's not an easy business, and I actually wish them luck.  If you like adrenaline and being up in the middle of the night because money is flooding out the door because of hackers, then money transmission is your cup of tea!
[All that said, sign up for Novauri.  We let you control your private keys, and we built the thing from the ground up to be safe.  Also, we know more about this business than our competitors, if that isn't plain obvious from the information I just shared with you above.](

The customers on an exchange are each individuals and will act as such.  When you combine enough of them, it's no longer a series of individuals but several herds of sheep with a few wolves.
The wolf doesn't hold the naked short position for long.  It is a quick move to drive down the price, trigger stop loss orders, margin calls, and then cover.
They cover the naked shorts before anyone can even log into the exchange to transfer their bitcoin to another wallet.

It's a service that lets you buy and sell bitcoin using ACH bank withdrawals and deposits.  It requires a validated email address and password, mandatory 2FA via SMS text or a token generating app, and a linked US bank account (via trial deposits or instant authentication by logging in over oauth).  Trading over $3,000 / day in buys + sells also requires KYC.
It's US only at first.  Our beta will be March or April, and our public release will be July of 2015.
The difference is, instead of using "hot" and "cold" wallets, we don't have access to your private keys.  You can create a wallet using our service, but the design is such that we never see your private keys in unencrypted form (and in one design we never see them in encrypted form either...).  That means we can't steal your money.  It also means we don't have to pay for insurance or the extra security, which means we cost less.
There's a lot more, but that's the idea.  Our team has done a lot of international products, so we're going to take it overseas pretty quickly.  It's being funded by the people building it, so we really need support to get this off the ground.  It's pretty darn expensive to become a money transmitter in all 50 states, and having some traction with the community will help us with investors who can help us with the crazy upfront costs.
That's what it is, exactly.  Let me know if you want more information, happy to spend too much time on reddit.  It's one of my gifts :).

Is it really that freaking hard to start a bitcoin fund?  
The IRS ruled bitcoin as property.  Structure it as a REIT, get it listed on an exchange, and let's get on with it!
There are over 8 trillion dollars invested in 401k and IRA plans in the US, 2000 times more than the current market cap of bitcoin.  There are over 20 trillion in total retirement assets, or 5000 times the present market capitalization of bitcoin.  
If just in the USA, people invested 1% of their retirement savings into bitcoin, the price of bitcoin would be 50 times higher.  0.1%?  5 times higher.
If I can invest my 401k in high risk German junk bond funds, and microcap uranium mining companies working in Africa, or companies that are incorporated in other Countries as ADRs doing gosh knows what with other Countries that may or may not be on US sanctions lists (I said can, not that I was), then why can't I put money into Bitcoin?  
Someone needs to get their act together and create a mainstream bitcoin investment vehicle.  At least explain to the public what is taking so ridiculously long!

Two-bit idiot, I take some issue with the way you write about the 2.0 version of the rules, starting with the fact that you haven't read them yet and only heard a speech.
First of all, "We Got X" is ridiculous.  It's "We Lost Y, and the benefit of having this rule in place will be Z".  I don't see you talking about Y or Z at all.  
This should be viewed through the lens of "is this doing more good than harm", not "gee golly this is so much better than the other version did you read that thing?"
Sorry, not a very good article.  You don't really understand what you are writing about, or the magnitude of the effect these regulations will have on bitcoin, not to mention the duration.  
The BSA has been the root cause of identity theft since the 1970s with its outdated "data retention" rules.  They didn't anticipate things like modern data center storage, 3rd party vendors, encryption, or modern databases, so it creates an environment where companies keep multiple copies of everyones' personal information every time they want to open a financial account.  Want to know why everyones' identity keeps getting stolen?  It's the BSA, and every other Country in the world copying it as a model.
Now the BSA hasn't been updated for a world with computers.  Do you think this BitLicense will be updated as the technology grows?  Unless it is exceedingly well done, this regulation will be damaging to innovation.  It's foolish to write articles like this without reading it first.

Glitchy behavior?  Seriously?
If they are delisted, there need to be clearly defined criteria to be listed on the site, and remain listed.  The issues must be specified as defects (i.e. requirement / expected result, actual result, requirement to fix).
Glitchy behaviour could be not liking the way a button renders, or occasionally failing UX elements that have no impact at all on security.  Most versions of truecrypt had glitchy behaviour, my ironkey had glitchy behavior.  That was software and software/hardware that was a hell of a lot more secure than any of these services except maybe armory.

Why would you trade a product with additional counterparty risk when it is so easy for the ETF manager to digitally sign and prove that the funds are there to back the ETF?
Gold can be naked shorted because it's in a vault somewhere behind armed guards.  It's not easy to verify if there are 100,000,000 ounces on hand or 50,000,000.
With bitcoin, it's a simple matter of signing for an address with balances.  
See the difference?  Like I said, bullshit, you can't naked short bitcoin.  If you did, I could make a competing ETF that has verified funds, has less counterparty risk, and takes away all of your marketshare.

No, it would correct after one confirmation.  A number in a database could be incorrect, but not if it was reading from the blockchain.
What Gox is saying is that all the numbers in a database were never added up and compared to the number of bitcoins held in their receive addresses (pooled accounts) for years.

It is like comparing the cost of building the great pyramids using slaves that you work to death (centralized) vs industrial earth moving equipment and cranes (bitcoin) and comparing only the calories burned from food vs fuel!
There is a massive employee and facilities overhead associated with standing up centralized systems.  There are supporting industries that exist just to serve this need.  With time bitcoin eliminates this need.  The overhead from human and facilities costs dwarfs the cost of bank hardware vs the blockchain and mining.

Profit model is 100% bid/ask spread for beta customers.  We may charge a transaction fee for non-beta customers, but we're not sure.  The financials are very much above water with no fees at all. 
We are profitable because not being a bank = no insurance, no ultra expensive security around massive hot/cold wallets, no explaining why it's safe for us to sit on 100s of millions of USD in bitcoin to regulators (lower deposit costs), so that means lower overhead, bigger profit margins, which allows us to offer better rates with no fees.  
That's not our long term strategy to make money, but it's going to more than profitable enough to get off the ground.

Hi BrainDamageLDN,
The price of bitcoin is not driven by news.  The price of bitcoin is driven by market dynamics.  Please keep reading.  
Bitcoin trades on many exchanges where buyers and sellers are matched very quickly.  These markets are essentially the same environments where stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies trade.
There are thousands of incredibly smart people who do nothing but build computer programs to exploit prices and profits on open markets.  When "news" breaks, like Dell taking bitcoin, or ebay talking about bitcoin, someone already cheated and bought bitcoin on that news, bringing the price up long before the public knew.  Even with an SEC monitoring stocks, this is assumed in stock markets.  There are no such rules for bitcoin.  
This is why there is an old addage amongst those who trade, "don't trade on the news".
In fact, many make their living doing the opposite.  Using the "news" as what's called a "contrarian indicator".  Meaning, good news = sell, bad news = buy.  This strategy naturally takes advantage of people who don't know any better, and panic sell on bad news, or buy on good news.  
There are trading algorithms that sense market depth.  Depth is how many buyers or sellers there are at certain price levels.  These algorithms know that if they sell enough or buy enough to punch through certain levels, it can move the price far without much money.  This makes people panic, sell or buy more, and reinforce the trend.  The programs then can cover their position, but with the other fools jumping on the trend, they can cover their position at a steep profit, and make another profit when the price swings the other way.
So what I'm telling you is, it's not about news.  It was never about news.  It's about psychology.  Unless you are a professional trader, or you write high frequency trading algorithms, you need to stop fretting, take a step back, and think to yourself.
Do I still believe in the reasons that caused me to buy bitcoin?
When I look at how much I have bought, and I completely lose it all, or it goes no where in price, will I be OK financially?
If I am trying to profit in another currency, have I made a plan to sell at certain price points, or times in the future, and will I stick with that plan?
If you answered 1 and 2 YES, and if 3 either doesn't apply to you or you answered YES, then you need to calm down and go find another thing to read about other than the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:10:59
Based on his analogies of bitcoin to checks, he doesn't understand what bitcoin is at a meaningful level, or [the inefficiencies it can drive out of the payment system]( not to mention other industries.
So, Warren Buffet is not qualified to have an informed opinion on bitcoin because he doesn't understand it.
What he should have said was "I don't understand bitcoin, and therefore I won't buy it."
That's honest, and excellent advice.  You shouldn't buy bitcoin if you don't understand it.  
Still, assuming he knows enough about it to declare it a "joke", and advising other against it, well, that's a display of ignorance and hubris that's pretty common in old, rich and powerful people.
This isn't news, though.  He's a value investor using a derivative of Benjamin Graham's approach to value investing.  He can't begin to value something he doesn't understand.  I'm not sure why this would be a surprising reaction from him on bitcoin.

Why would you think the government would be chronically under-funded?  
It's boring to repeat that the higher up the socio-economic ladder you go you'll see a direct negative correlation between the actual % of taxes paid vs. what the published taxation rates are globally by income bracket.  That correlation holds across private individuals and corporations.  It's a clear line on a scatterplot.  Many books have been written.
The rich can afford to figure out how to evade taxes legally or through channels where they cannot be prosecuted.  In the US you can lobby lawmakers to have loopholes inserted into the tax code.  This is pandemic in 1st world Countries, not just the US.  See, politicians need to be reelected, and those with control of capital write the laws.
Normal and poor people either comply, pay stiffer penalties than if they hadn't, or go to jail.  It's easy to catch poor people, harder to catch those with the resources at hand to evade, and those with the most resources are writing the laws with which that they must comply.  As I would likely as well.  Such is to be human.
In the end when you boil away all the nonsense it's a binary question where you have one of two paths to choose: central control executed according to the consensus of a group of elites vs. decentralization and a predictable, math based model that cannot be modified by humans as required, but also is not subject to modification because of a human opinion that such modification is required.
How did the US Government collect tax before the privately owned Federal Reserve was founded and an income tax existed?  Magic?
My real question: Do you believe that redirection of wealth through heavily corrupted and ham handed taxation (including inflationary global monetary policy executed from the BIS via the Central Banks) is better than a formula based on math that is predictable?  Better in terms of speed and inefficiency?
I would sure trust math before I would trust a counterparty, nun, psycopath, banker, or otherwise.  I damn know well a platform, even with free market proof of work is going to cause less economic drag than a bunch of powerbrokers and academics dictating policy in a locked room.
Let it go, and let's try evolving out of the Roman empire and actually leveraging technology, shall we?  Let's not be 21st century luddites.
We're all trying to help people.  I believe that.  There are no profiteers in the Central banks and I truly believe that everyone at the switches has transcended such petty corruptions.
Still, do you trust your human decision making based on analysis, or a flawless, cryptographically sealed and decentralized free market for currency issuance?
Let the currency be solid, monkey with taxing durable goods and real estate.  Tangible items.  Get the lawyers and accountants as far from technology as possible.  Let math run the protocol, not process cops and their puppeteers.
Thanks for the ear.  Eventually we let AI take over if we need to counter feedback loops in business cycles causing negative and detrimental harmonics.  I believe that the free market will naturally correct these harmonics as long as the language of the markets is crystallized in a protocol.  That includes counteracting genocides in emerging nations better than a military response to the UN through simple risk vs reward.  There's nothing like the piercing sunlight of math to bleach the darkest stains on the shirt of humanity, yo.

I'm unclear how this solves for calculating the cost basis of the coins spent.
You have to use a FIFO method, which doesn't work unless your wallet knows all of your addresses, and the earliest date you acquired coins.

Centralized systems lack trust.  That means they must be secured and will, by definition, occasionally have insider breaches or be "hacked" (which is almost always an insider pretending btw).  The reason decentralized systems are more efficient is not only because they are decentralized, it's because of consensus and the blockchain.

The customer identification program sections of the patriot act do not require collection of a palm scan and picture of someone's head to validate their identity.  The requirements don't even require a government issued ID.
You could have just as easily had them enter information freehand and partnered with a company like Experian to validate the data against public records and meet the regulatory standard.  You can prefill the information with the 2d scan code on the back of most ID's without requiring a copy.
In fact, under $1,000 you aren't required to collect personal information at all.  This is why it's entirely possible to purchase an open loop Visa or Amex gift card in the checkout line without providing ID.
It will be necessary because you decide it is, not because of a rule or regulation.

You got it.  We have to create an address to make sales and sends work without a 2-step process, but we can do that in a way that we never know your private keys or even have temporary access to them.  
We still won't be as secure as a paper wallet, but we'll be on the level of a blockchain.info or similar.  We are going to do a few things some won't like, e.g. we're making 2FA mandatory to open an account, but it's just such an important safety measure we have to make it required to keep most of our customers safe.  We're still going to encourage our customers to get their bitcoin into a more secure wallet if they build up an excessive balance.  I'm considering nagging them with the equivalent of what linkedin does when you haven't filled out your profile.
Also... we're letting you register any bitcoin address to your profile.  That means when you buy we will send the bitcoin directly to any address you choose, including an address for your paper wallet, Trezor, or whatever you would like.

Spend the money on creating well documented, easy to use, bug free merged mining software, and keep it up to date.  This could be an extension of QT.
Centralization of mining is the risk we should be concerned about over the longer term, and merged mining is hard to do competitively for a hobbyist without using a pool.  
Widely distributed, maintained, and free software that takes care of merged mining will create more competition in mining pools, and even allow people to easily "do it themselves", and still remain somewhat competitive with large pools.
This will also diminish the effect of merge mined sidechains pushing mining towards a more centralized model through pools, as they increase the complexity of merged mining as well.
I really think this needs a closer look.  It's understood that with block rewards mining is competitive, but why can't we have software that is up to date and at least levels the playing field?  It would seem that this would be a smart way to invest in the overall long term health of the bitcoin protocol.

The attacks through TOR were SSL stripping where the bad guy (MITM) was running a tor exit node and would intercept requests to an HTTPS service and downgrade the connection to unencrypted and unauthenticated HTTP.  
Then if the person didn't notice the http switch and the browser doesn’t enforce HTTPS (bc.i is now enforcing HSTS and is working on HPKP last I read), any data or credentials submitted can be read as clear text in the message and stored by the MITM.  It was intercepted credentials by downgrading the connection to read the message.
[Here is a writeup](
[Here is an excellent video - skip to 38:34.](
The attacks using the TOR exit node https downgrading could be used to attack other services than bc.i, including those that don't use js.   When you downgrade the connection you can intercept the payload for user and password in clear text.

New regulation is not the same as enforcing existing laws.  I'm not an anarchist, I'm a pragmatist.  
I strongly believe that it's still too damn early to be regulating bitcoin exchanges in new ways before the industry has even had a chance to evolve.  I also think that any new regulation needs to be MUCH more transparent than that I've seen in traditional banking historically and focused on helping users, not power brokers in back rooms drive off small business competition.  Every time a business fails, that doesn't mean we need regulation.  
It's not too early to prosecute people like Marky here for international wire fraud and grand theft, or whatever the phrase is in the applicable jurisdiction using japanese characters.  There's no need to make up new rules (and take power in the process) to take care of situations like these.  We don't need a brave new world of privacy invasion to track down embezzlers.

History indicates otherwise.


 
Tablets spread about as fast as molasses in January.  In 1987 (that's 27 years ago)  Apple Computer started its tablet project.  Their first tablet was released in 1993 (that's 21 years ago), the Apple Newton.  It failed to take off.  Since then Microsoft tried, others tried, and it's only with the iPad that we finally saw the tablet computer take off.
The smart phone took even longer.  The idea was conceived in 1971 (that's 43 years ago).  The first smart phones were in Japan, and weren't iPhones.  The NTT Docomo was released in Japan in 1999, and became huge.  Japan was about 10 years ahead of everyone else in this area, especially when it came to mobile computing and text messaging.  The evolution started in the mid 1990s though, so it took about 20 years to mature.


People who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.  Even the telephone took 50 years to catch on.  You might want to rethink your philosophy on this, because it's clearly based on fiction.

I love your optimism, but I'm not sure that I share it.
The gold and silver markets have been manipulated down for years through naked shorts.  It's not some crazy conspiracy theory, you can find information about it from numerous reputable sources.
The manipulation boils down to the Fed acting through bullion banks to naked short gold in the NY Comex futures market.  Prices tank, which triggers stop loss orders, and margin calls, and more stop loss orders, technical support breaks down, and it scares the hell out of little guys who sell before they lose their houses and get out of the gold trusts.  The bullion banks then repurchase the shares and redeem them for bullion from the trusts.  The gold is then sold on the London physical market, which supplies physical delivery demands from APAC, while confirming the price shenanigans that unfolded on the Comex.
Bitcoin is a little different, in that it's much easier to transport, verify, and divide, but the same principals apply if we let large entities sell short without any assets to sell on a virtual book.  
Think  of it this way, if I know all of the stop-loss triggers and amounts on my exchange down the sell side, and the limit buy order amounts and volumes, I can calculate how much money it would take to sell through all of that and if I would come out ahead on the bottom end.  
It's not hard to do this type of calculation, it's just a lot of algebra and risk management if other whales try to eat my lunch on the way down.  But hell, I probably have lunch with those whales, so who is to say?  If you can naked short sell, and you have truck loads of fiat, and no need to own the actual digital currency, you can steamroll through all the stop-loss orders, create a sell avalanche that compounds with margin calls for the speculative types, and really drive the thing into the ground.  Then you buy it back cheap to cover the sold counterfeited bitcoin.
It works, and if you are big enough and have enough money, it's a sustainable business model that can be used to manipulate markets.  Not pie in the sky stuff, it's all been done before for years.  See gold, except you don't even need to sell anything in London, just buy back the BTC when prices are lower!

This is Will from Novauri. 
We are accepting sign ups for our US closed beta release.  Our beta is scheduled for late March or April of 2015. 
Novauri is a bitcoin purchase and sale service that is designed to not act like a bitcoin bank. We don't require you to hand us control of your money, or "allow" you to keep control as an "option".  You keep your private keys.  That means we don't sit on millions of dollars of bitcoin like our competitors.  That's bitcoin that, if you read the fine print, is largely uninsured and can be stolen by employees or hackers, creating sudden and violent bankruptcies.   [**Read more about this issue here.**]( 
Want to have your bitcoin purchases sent directly to a different address, maybe a paper or hardware wallet?  No problem.  Register the address to your profile and choose it as the receiving address when you buy.  
[Please help us beta test our service and refine the experience.  In return we will waive all fees on your purchases and sales forever.  Click here to sign up for Novauri with no transaction fees for the life of your account.](

I'm clear on the books and records section, but I've now given the documents a more thorough read and they never say "If you hold customer funds, you also have to hold this data" in reference to section 7.  No offense, but you made that part up.
Covered activities are broader than just if you "hold customer funds".  They specifically call out exchange, transmission, and storage.  That means even if you aren't holding customer funds, or maybe you also don't exchange fiat for virtual currency, you can still be covered under the rules.

They have assumed some costs and made a few integrations that are new.  Nothing they did was new or innovative, but they have put together an extremely feature rich product.
Here's my count of "new" things:
* Insurance (no idea why it took this long to insure deposits)
* Free (they are taking a loss to build a customer base, again, others should have done this)
* Instant debit/credit with payment networks (this is a big deal- getting cash in and out is a hassle with ACH in the USA)
What I do not like:
* 6 character minimum password - really?
* Exchange rate spread?
* Fixed BTC address for your account?
* ID Validation 
They are running Patriot act CIP checks on everyone like a bank, which leads to copies of your personal information being stored at vendors that provide ID validation services, and other vendors.  That violates your privacy, ties all of your information to your address, and puts you at risk of identity theft.  
They probably use a fixed BTC address, meaning anyone with your address can see your transactions, and if their central DB with your SSN/Name/DOB/Address/Email/Phone is stolen, everyones' banking history becomes instantly public information.  That's bad and the same type of horrible stuff we've enjoyed since regulators put that crap in the patriot act.
They are making money from exchange rate spread and monetizing your identity and transaction history, probably through advertising eventually, and also merchant services on 0 confirmation transactions.  The last one is minor.

After reading the polarized views of the core developers in this and other threads, and knowing what kinds of interests are at stake, it's hard to not be a bit more pessimistic.  If everyone would set their ridiculously overgrown egos aside for a few minutes and think about this objectively, there is a clock ticking and a complex system growing more complex every day.
The truth is, we're already to the point where only a few major changes to bitcoin are possible with consensus, and then possibly only after a meltdown.  It's now or it won't happen.
So, do this:
1) Make a list of priorities based on problems with bitcoin.  
2) For each problem, quickly think of the solutions, their complexity, risk, and requirements around consensus.  
2a) If you have to put numerical ratings, weights, and multiply it out to make geeks happy, then fine, do a NASA style "FMEA".  
3) Have your nerd fights quickly, and then focus on just one or two at the top. 
That should lead you guys to common sense I would hope, and you'll quickly see that there is less time than you thought, and your ability to change bitcoin is actually diminished from what you would expect.
If I was your boss and not working as a shill, and I'm not saying whether I am or not, I would give you these priorities ranked in order.  You should only focus on 
1) Split core wallet client from network code.
1) Add deterministic wallet to wallet client.
1) Solve block size issue - figure out a radix tree that doesn't have branch 51% attack vulnerabilities.
1) Create anonymity in network communications - route over tor ubiquitously.
1) Add routing addresses to core wallet client so personal information leaks don't expose your banking history to the entire world.
1) Solve mining problem.  getblocktemplate is awesome, but it creates an incentive to centralize hardware, which is a worse unintended consequence.  You can't change the SHA256 x2 or miners will lose millions on their ASICS.  The only way out is to funnel money into p2p pools.  Perhaps you could find a creative but simple way to change full nodes / core so p2pools are preferred or enforced.
1) Play nice with ethereum, and try to talk them out of direct competition.  I don't think they are a scam, which is more than I can say for every other derivative.
Focus only on  stop fighting and get to work.

Add that risk to the fact that without the hash power of the main blockchain, a 51% attack is comparatively simple to perform and you now have an easy way for attackers to steal all pegged coins if they can maintain control for the peg lock period.
That makes side chains less secure than a nascent altcoin with its own hashing system.  The true altcoin would be able to use more than an SPV proof, and could hard fork to work around a 51% attack if one happened.  With SPV proof side chains, once an attacker steals the frozen peg, the sidechain can't take such measures.  No one will fork bitcoin to save a sidechain, or alter the protocol to allow for a do-over SPV proof after the lock period has passed and the frozen coins are stolen.
So what I am saying is that non-merged mining side chains aren't viable, and blockstream is effectively a think tank working on an unfinished idea, not a threat to bitcoin.  
Even merge mined sidechains are a problem because they force the use of pools, and destroy the potential for bitcoin mining to return to a more decentralized model.
Sidechains don't work.  They are a theory.  No one is going to implement SPV proof sidechains as proposed.  If these fundamental problems were solved the issues you listed would be irrelevant and there would be new issues anyway.  I don't see the point in worrying about vaporware or beating them up about known issues. New issues?  Sure.  The research they are doing could be valuable if they solve some or all of the problems they face.

Revealing the public key exposes the user to a theoretical attack with quantum computers that don't exist.  The same is true of every address that has spent on the blockchain that still has bitcoin on it.  If that was a real security hole, the entire basis for all secure communication on the internet would be in jeopardy as well.  If quantum computers were getting close to being able to crack SHA256 or RIPEMD160 alone everyone would move to a quantum computer resistant method well before this anyway.  By the way, this would also jack up the consensus mechanism, so bitcoin itself would need other fixes too.  Your statement is basically FUD.
And having a child private key and the master public key I can recreate the master private key with HD wallets as well, and you know what?  Who cares, it's not a significant risk.  Possible?  Sure.  A significant threat to most users?  No.

You are talking about a return to a 1:1 gold standard, but using bitcoin as the backing.  That will never, ever happen.  Not with the US Dollar.  The present fractional reserve system is predicated on a certain amount of accumulating deficit by definition.  The US Dollar cannot be backed by bitcoin, as the USD must inflate at a certain rate in order to remain solvent.  This is because the banks making up the federal reserve make money when currency is issued, and this money they make is by definition a deficit and inflation.  The US Dollar and financial system around it cannot be backed by bitcoin, not if bitcoin is traded on a free market, not without changing the underpinnings of the federal reserve and how we issue currency.

The USPS is already a licensed money transmitter.
This is bigger than silly puns.  This could be huge.
Bitcoin =/ email.  Mail wasn't regulated anywhere close to as heavily as money transfer.  FedEx, UPS were free to compete.
If every USPS location becomes an exchange hub for converting fiat to bitcoin, or bitcoin to fiat, well it's just fricking huge.  
The big applications are international money transfer sends that could be funded at the counter by purchasing a chit based product, like a gift card.  It could also completely replace their Postal Money Order system and make the bank in the middle unnecessary.  They would save on net due to reduced accounting and banking overhead.

We are subject to regulation as a money transmitter under FinCEN guidance nationally, and also need to comply with regulator's guidance on a state by state basis as well.   
That means we have to do a lot, including collecting profile information.  If a customer wants to buy and sell a lot of bitcoin, we may need to verify their ID.  We need to perform other checks, file reports to the Treasury, and meet a lot of rules and requirements.  [It's all outlined on our regulation page here.](
Novauri is not an anonymous service to buy and sell bitcoin, not even close.  The difference is that 100% of the time we never have access to our customers' private keys.

That doesn't prove or mean it was *meant* to be problematic.  It means it *is* problematic.  There's a *big* difference.


Now you've gone into full-on fantasy land.  Computational power increases for the same investment at a rate doubling every 18 months.  Storage capacity is increasing at a rate doubling every 12 months (faster than Moore's law).  Broadband speed is only doubling every 24 months or so, which is arguably due to the fact that the US broadband system is captured by oligopolists, which puts a drag on the overall increase in speed.
Taking all of those things together, blocksize can increase at a rate of 50% a year aggressively and still make bitcoin full node clients accessible to home users.  40% a year will not only give a big compounding effect, allowing bitcoin to be used as at least a world currency by 2040, but will allow anyone to run a full node.

Well, I hate to tell you, but that's a bunch of bs.
The telephone was initially shunned and wasn't popular for many years.  Western Union turned down an opportunity to purchase the patent on the telephone, writing that it was unlikely to catch on.  
In the late 1800's it was only used by affluent families.  The telephone didn't become ubiquitous until after WW2, and only then because of economic reasons, not marketing.  It became cheap enough for people to afford.  The limiting factor was infrastructure and technology, not marketing.  The telephone was invented before electric light, but didn't see widespread adoption until much later than the lightbulb replaced oil lamps.
Television was the same way.  It was initially introduced in 1949, but was too expensive for most people to use and own.  As prices dropped, and word of mouth spread, more and more people bought televisions.
Just like with anything else, it was a supply/demand curve.  Technology improvements and investment in infrastructure reduce costs, and demand increases accordingly.
Television and the telephone gained traction because they were desirable and attainable.  It would be best to focus on ways to make bitcoin desirable and attainable, and save the marketing for after this is figured out.
There was no missed boat.  The boats are still being designed and built.  Some will sink and some will sail.  They aren't going to sail on clever marketing.  They are going to sail if they offer something to the user that is desirable and attainable.  Something that allows the user a new ability, or something old that can be done faster, better, and/or cheaper.
It's that simple.  Really.

Bitcoin has survived on the sole basis of it's math and consensus system for five years.  It was also much more vulnerable in the earlier years than it is today.  Right now, bitcoin cannot be shut down or stopped, barring an organized, government sponsored attack.  That's not likely at all.  Governments are waiting and seeing.
The Euro was released as an accounting currency in January 1999, so it's survived for about 15 years, three times as long as bitcoin.
US federal reserve notes were authorized in 1913, but had it's gold backing decoupled in 1933, and completely removed in 1971.  In its current form, Federal Reserve Notes have survived for 43 years or so, or a little more than 8 times longer than bitcoin.
The average lifespan of fiat currency is 27 years, with the shortest being one month.  Just for contrast, the Great British Pound is the longest surviving fiat currency, was created in 1694, and has survived for 317 years.  That said, the GBP was originally valued at 12 ounces of silver bullion, so it's presently worth around 0.5% of its original value.
Bitcoin has survived for a little under 20% of the lifespan that a fiat currency survives on average before it becomes worthless.  There's no indication of it going to zero, as there is still very strong demand.  25 bitcoin are minted every 10 minutes, 150 an hour, or 3600 a day.  It takes over $1m/day in demand just to keep the price even, that inflation rate halves every 4 years.  
Bitcoin is trending to be more resilient than average fiat currencies very soon.  Established fiat currencies are not anywhere close to as stable as you seem to believe.  The incidence of a fiat currency becoming worthless is on average 27 years, not every 500 million years or whatever it is for asteroid impacts.
So when you use phrases like "extremely low" or "safer bet" or "traditional" or "very risky", you are using qualitative terms.  This is not a smart way to make investment decisions.

Got it.  Good summary otherwise.
What I'm trying to figure out is how to introduce innovation in regulation without it becoming cronyism.  The rules need to be non-prescriptive.  There should be economic consequences for bad things, a system to detect bad things - but that system must be mutable, not static and fixed like most law is written.  They need to absolutely stop telling people how to make bad things not happen.  This is the root of why regulation keeps causing horrible unintended consequences and stagnates innovation.  
Financial services companies and banks are following rules that were written long before computers were in use.  Changing the rules is a monumental pain in the ass in almost every major country.  This is because bureaucracies grow up around them which of course have a vested interest in seeing the rules stay in place.  The rules are their job security and power.  Is it really any wonder that the rate of innovation and improvement in financial technology has been stagnant for decades?
I think it might be time to do a full re-write of their proposed framework and rules.

If you would like to read the text without visiting our site, here is the copy/paste below.  -Will
**USD 2.0 – wouldn’t that be great?**
The world desperately needs technologies like Fedcoin.  Money has fallen far behind advances in technology.  We endure levels of monetary friction that predate the information age.  Half of the world’s adult population, 2.5 billion people are unbanked, yet desperately need access to modern financial services.  These billions remain unbanked because it’s too expensive to give them accounts, and despite the best efforts of extremely well funded organizations and the smartest individuals in the world, nothing seems to change.   This situation is entirely caused by an arranged marriage between our monetary systems and outdated sets of rules that trace their origins to the days when we knew the earth was flat.  Most of the rules we follow in 2015 were created before people used computers, yet we seem surprised that an international money transfer costs the poorest people 8-10%.  You can email someone halfway around the world in seconds for free, but a wire will cost you $50 and take 3-5 days.  We are living in the dark ages of money.
**Rules?  It’s all about following the rules.**
The rules different Governments apply to monetary systems are so demanding that only well funded financial institutions can afford to follow them.  End users of the currency must open “accounts” with these institutions in order to participate, and there is no universal standard for transmitting money between these financial institutions globally.  Standards in the same Country vary widely.  This complicated global regulatory framework is why we suffer from unacceptably high fees when sending money overseas or between banks.   A Fedcoin technology could, if properly designed, eliminate this friction entirely and allow anyone interested to essentially “download a bank”.  That said, it’s difficult to not be a skeptic.  There are three major issues standing in the way of mass adoption of a Fedcoin like technology.
**Issue 1: Fedcoin Regulatory Incompatibility**
The first major issue with Fedcoin has to do with regulatory incompatibility.  The Bank Secrecy Act and similar regulation require anyone moving money to comply with strict sets of record keeping and monitoring requirements.  These requirements exist to ensure that money is not transmitted to individuals or entities that are on sanctions or other lists or for reasons considered illegal or otherwise prohibited.  These rules and the institutions that enforce them will never allow the download of an application that lets users send and receive US dollars anonymously.  There will be a requirement for users of the software to be identified first, creating a network of ID verified individuals who are allowed to transmit funds.  This alone introduces cost and friction, as some entity, likely a company or companies, must positively identify users of the software.  There will need to be processes to revoke licenses for users that are added to lists of unapproved users.  Identity thieves will create false users, and the same arms race that exists today between banks and organized criminal identity thieves will continue as it does in today’s system.  So while we may see a consistent system for money transmission, we will still see the same hurdles around identity management that exist today.  These requirements around ID will also make it economically nonviable to let the poorest people use the Fedcoin software.  Half of the world’s adult population, 2.5b people are unbanked today, and without a consistent standard for individual ID, Fedcoin with ID requirements won’t be able to help these people.  Today banks and other financial institutions exist because they are able to comply with these rules cost effectively.  Fedcoin as proposed fails to automate all of the complicated and often inconsistent rules that apply to financial institutions, which means that these same institutions would still need to exist to ensure compliance, regardless of whether Fedcoin software is used to transmit money or not.
**Issue 2: Fedcoin Centralization and Human Nature**
The second major issue with Fedcoin relates to monetary policy and the nature of the technology.  While decentralized cryptocurrencies issue new currency units based on predictable math based rules and prevent counterfeiting though economic incentives offered to miners, Fedcoin would be directly connected to US monetary policy and those controlling it.  While many see this as a positive, as the US dollar presently experiences lower volatility than bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, it fundamentally changes one of the key beneficial properties of decentralized cryptocurrency, a predictable and transparent monetary policy that is not subject to human error.  The average lifespan for fiat currency is 27 years.  The Great British Pound is the longest lived currency today, surviving well over 300 years, yet when it was conceived, the GBP was fixed in value to one pound of sterling silver, and has lost well over 99% of its value in those 300+ years through inflationary monetary policy.  The US dollar enjoys status as the world’s reserve currency today and is typically the unit of account for trading oil, but this status is closely tied to geopolitical power.  This is not to say that the US dollar will not continue to enjoy its status as the most widely used currency in the world, but history indicates that the lifespan of even the greatest currencies comes to an end.  In 2008 we came right to the edge of a serious global currency crisis that was narrowly averted.  This pattern of financial crisis is predictable and happens roughly every 10 years or so.  When studied, there is a common theme behind them.  Human decision making typically caused by greed created financial imbalances that built upon themselves resulting in a crash.  Compare this history with bitcoin or other cryptocurrency with math based monetary policy where inflation is predictable and limited.  These rules are not based on human decision making and value is tied to its effectiveness as a medium of exchange, not the backing of a sovereign government of elected or appointed individuals.  This makes bitcoin much like digital gold, another form of currency accepted across borders and cultures universally for thousands of years.  Bitcoin has survived for over 6 years and has yet to be hacked or compromised.  It looks increasingly likely that issues around scale will be overcome as computer storage costs drop.  This makes bitcoin an ideal “neutral ground” for money transfer across powers that may or may not see eye to eye.  This is the other side of the coin in terms of the volatility argument against bitcoin, it has superior properties as money and a built in neutrality that insulates itself from politics.  The coin has been flipped and time will tell if its heads or tails.
**Issue 3: Conflict of Interest**
The third major issue with Fedcoin is that it conflicts with the best interests of banks.  Banks that do not directly profit from the creation of money stand to lose with Fedcoin, as lending activities could easily become obsolete and automated by the software.  Beyond credit, Fedcoin would make money transmission effectively free, which would remove most if not all income from remittance and payments services.  These are other profit centers for banks and financial services companies.  The lobbying against this type of technology will be fierce and unprecedented, the stakes could not be higher, and these institutions are very good at getting their way.  I believe that Fedcoin’s only chance is that if that all incumbents are sufficiently threatened by an even more disruptive technology, such as bitcoin.  I don’t think bitcoin represents an existential threat to these institutions at this time, and as long as taxes must be paid in local currency, it’s unlikely it ever will.
These are very early days, but it’s clear that bitcoin and Fedcoin are fundamentally different technologies with very different properties and value to end users.  Bitcoin is a decentralized form of electronic cash that exists without a central authority and is widely used today.  Fedcoin is a derivative idea that represents a standardization of the technology behind transmitting US dollars.  Fedcoin carries the pros and cons of the underlying currency and is more of a transmission standard than a new form of cash.  Fedcoin would be a wonderful improvement over today’s payment systems, but it’s highly unlikely we’ll ever see it in general use.  Banks in the US can’t even agree to modernize the ACH system.  This system is still used as the primary method to move money inside the US, was conceived in 1974, and runs on a batch system that is manila folder friendly.   The backbone of the US financial system is about as fast as the Pony Express because we can’t agree to a defacto real-time settlement system, yet we are going to implement an even more advanced Fedcoin technology and hold hands while singing campfire songs and roasting marshmallows?  Forget it, there are just too many complications and unaligned forces that have a say in the matter for this idea to work.  It will take an existential threat in order to align these forces and create real change.  That threat is not bitcoin.  That threat is destabilization of the system itself.  The root cause of this threat won’t be a new technology, it will be good old fashioned greed.

It's not the only variable involved.  Your statement about below 40 being routinely cracked by amateurs also assumes a weak password.  They don't email the wallet anymore, and they are using an improved password complexity library.  Also, there are other wallets on bitcoin.org that are not using 3m like do on your KeePassX password service.  I wish keepass would use the yubikey as a second factor instead of as an OTP...

The problem with apocalyptic situations is no one ever sees them coming.  The foreseeable future is often a few seconds, ask the dinosaurs who were wiped out by a meteor, or the European pension fund managers who loaded up on "aaa" collateralized debt obligations.
Traditional investments are smart until they aren't, then everyone knew they weren't smart and were saying so all along.  
Don't lie to yourself, that's a good first step towards being a better investor.  A good second step is to account for currency risk in all investments.  Salary denominated in dollars?  House price inversely correlated to artificially low mortgage rates due to government loan subsidies?  Those are risks to diversify as well.

I haven't read that page specifically.  From a glance this looks like a BIP70 fork with more 509 certs that allows for instant confirmations as long as the payee (merchant or receiver) and wallet service (payer) trust each other?  
So it's a on-us bitcoin payment network system for enabling instant retail transactions, among other things.  Pretty cool.  I can think of a few uses for that besides ecommerce and retail too, like for selling instantly from 3rd party addresses (true bring your own wallet bitcoin sales for fiat).  I like it...

The thing is, for bitcoin's price to break even, there has to be a net sale because of blockchain rewards.  With 25 bitcoin generated on average every 10 minutes (slightly less as difficulty is readjusted every 2016 blocks / or what should be 2 weeks), every single day miners are going to be selling 3,600 BTC.  A lot of that is picked up by brokerage services who sell it back to their customers.  Even at $400/bitcoin (a bargain in my book), there's $1.4m US in bitcoin that needs to be bought just to break even on supply / demand from blockchain reward inflation.  That will diminish here soon and again every 4 years, until it peters out entirely in 2140 (ish).
That alone is enough to keep the pressure on such that a business like mine will be a net seller of bitcoin overall.  Key word being overall.  If things go one way or the other violently, that's an entirely different ball of wax.

Let me start by saying that I have tremendous respect for both Peter Todd and Amir Taaki.  Stealth addresses and the implementation of dark wallet may have unfortunate names, but I am pretty darn sure that stealth addresses are going to be used as a way to separate and provide transaction privacy for users some day and hopefully without changing the implementation in the process.  Bitcoin desperately needs a level of privacy between the receiving address and every other transaction a user has performed.  That's what they have invented and implemented, essentially.
All that said, Peter and Amir don't know what they are talking about.  They don't understand interchange, what an issuing and acquiring bank represent, what card processors are, or what the payment networks in the middle do.  They sure as heck don't know how settlement works for card transactions either, which is a parallel and incredibly expensive process with KYB performed by the networks and banks.
Those systems take 3% out of the system whenever they are used to buy a good or service.  This is a massive amount of money.  A bit of that goes to cover chargebacks, but as we've seen, this can be automated with 2/3 multisig using an arbiter, timelock transactions, and other ways we can program money.
Bitcoin is cheaper than card networks.  Those guys probably feel pressured to be "smart" about anything, but if you look at their work experience, I would bet that they couldn't define the term "acquiring bank" or know something as basic as how CVV codes are generated, or the layout of a credit card number...
Sorry, they are wrong.  Bitcoin is way more efficient than current payment systems.  
On the surface the sole exception might be federated bank transfer systems like ACH or BACS/Fasterpayments, but these systems are heavily subsidized by banks who are profiting from fractional reserve lending, so it's not a true apples to apples comparison.  
Sorry guys, you are wrong.

If you put words in my mouth and then ask a question based on your version of what I said, that's not a question.  
Ask a question right now and I will do my best to answer it.


You haven't enumerated any security flaws in that thread, just like you can't here.  Every security system has potential vulnerabilities.  Ours is technically no different than other solutions that people trust today, except we don't control our users' private keys.  That's an improvement over existing models, not a flaw.


Oh, so you admit "one component" of our security model is working.  Interesting...


If you can make a coherent argument for how our system is flawed, or if you want to participate in a closed bug bounty we're planning soon, you are more than welcome to find the flaws and earn money in doing so.  
The truth is, you are making broad, completely unsubstantiated statements about a service you didn't build.  You haven't seen the codebase because we haven't released it yet.  The technical descriptions I've shared are pretty thorough, but describe a combination of methods that are used by other companies today, just in a unique combination.  
So yeah, you'll forgive me if I'm a bit skeptical about your little crusade for the truth "spending your time minimizing loss through informing people of the problems with your service".

Web wallets exist because there is market demand for these services.  You speak as if you would regulate what people can and can't use.  I prefer to let people choose for themselves.


That article about how javascript cryptography is a bad idea is flawed.  Javascript can be signed to prevent MITM attacks.  Even though wallets aren't doing this enough today, I don't recall any incidents of hacks involving intercepted javascript and forged downloads from web wallets, do you have examples of this actually effecting people who have lost bitcoin, or is this theory?


Your reading comprehension is curiously weak, especially from someone who presents themselves as a purported expert on these matters.  Did you even read what I wrote?  I brought them up because the person I was responding to was speaking of wallets and profitability.
Both coinbase and bitstamp have the ability for users to keep bitcoin there, so they are also wallets and very profitable.  Coinbase also allows downloading keys now with their multisig feature.  This is why I brought them up.  I'm not sure why you are speaking down to me about how the exchange and most other portions of these services are walled gardens.  Whether the code behind their wallets is public on github or not has nothing to do with their profitability.  Their approach to services has nothing to do with why I brought them up.

Hey Mr. Dingleberry, Mt. Gox was an exchange.  They allowed you to trade bitcoin for other currencies.  That's it.
There was a time that Gox was the only place offering those services, but that ended more than a year ago when btc-e and bitstamp came on the scene.  Now we also have Atlas ATS as well as other emerging, reputable exchanges.
Still, that doesn't make Mt. Gox the "fed" of bitcoin.  It makes them a currency exchange with a temporary monopoly.
The fed of bitcoin is an automation.  It's a combination of an exponentially decaying incentive and hashcash set to reward miners every 10 minutes, approximately.  Also, the intrinsic value of bitcoin isn't a percent of something else arbitrary at all.  The intrinsic value is the investment of computing power in the network mining infrastructure and the developers working on building out new things from the core protocol.

That video is gold, but the OP is right.
There is a reason that politicians use euphemisms and positive language to refer to topics that have the potential to be viewed from different perspectives.  The most questionable topics even have ideologies around them to protect them from scrutiny.
The military of a country would never call killing someone in a battle field "state sanctioned murder".  They would call it "neutralizing the threat".  They would never call the soldier a "murderer".  He or she would be a "war hero".
Words are a powerful way to preempt peoples' perceptions before they think about them critically.  So, why make it easier for your opponents to marginalize your technology by naming it in a controversial way?  
You really should take "dark" out and think about it from a political perspective if your intent is to make the biggest difference possible.

It's not 200 dollars in value, it's 200 dollars in capital gains.
For example, if you acquired all of your bitcoin for free back in 2009 or 2010, and then went shopping, any individual purchase under 200 would never be a taxable event.  You can actually use bitcoin for small purchases with no paperwork or dark clouds.
Let's say you bought your bitcoin at 500 and it's trading at 1000.  You can purchase up to 399.99 USD in stuff for each transaction and not have a taxable event, because the 500 &gt; 1000 appreciation was a 100% appreciation, meaning buying $399.99 of stuff with BTC means only 199.995 in capital gains.
When bitcoin is all grown up and not so volatile, we won't have these crazy price fluctuations.  This will mean you can use it for very large purchases without incurring 200 USD in capital gains.  Like buying cars.
Right now, if you buy a stick of bubblegum from your kid for 2 satoshis, you must report that as a property sale on your taxes.  Property has no minimum trade amount like foreign currencies.

It's naive to think that people won't continue to use un-spendable outputs to store data.  It's a waste of all of our time to fight about it like children.
Make OP_RETURN a standard transaction type and let the miners earn fees from the transactions.  40 bytes will give them a 256 bit hash and 8 bytes of meta data.  
If there's a real and justifiable reason to want 80 bytes, let's hear it.  I don't see why they couldn't use XOR or a similar additive cipher to shorten things up.
If there's a legitimate concern, has anyone done the math on the amount of bloat this would actually cause for everyone?
First, show why 80 is necessary over 40.  Then, if there's a concern about bloat, quantify it.  Only then find an appropriate way to solve it using economic incentives and disincentives, not name calling.
Also, please spare us the ideology about what the blockchain is and is not.  The blockchain exists because of the incentive to mine and earn coinbase transactions as well as transaction fees; the most profitable transactions tend to be included in blocks, others not.

My logic for that question is very simple. 
Step 1: put all currencies into two buckets: 1) decentralized / non significantly pre-mined and 2) centralized
Step 2: Think a lot.
First, with the truly decentralized currencies, it's all about the free market and adoption.  All consensus systems that function securely today involve proof of work in some capacity, and the amount of mining infrastructure is directly correlated to the security of the system, which increases the price.  No truly decentralized cryptocurrency can catch up with bitcoin at this point.  Will there be ethereums and decentralized storage cryptocurrencies?  I certainly think so.  Will there be sidechains?  I wouldn't rule it out.  Will any of them overtake bitcoin?  No way.  This would be like trying to introduce TCP/IP 2.0 six years after everyone started using TCP/IP.  It just won't happen.  The only way I would change my mind would be if there was a massive, and I mean massive crackdown on bitcoin from authorities and this drove the users into a fundamentally more anonymous cryptocurrency.  Barring any huge mistakes by authorities, bitcoin is TCP/IP for money.
Then let's think about centralized currencies.  They are gussied up versions of the same old thing, and mostly could be accomplished if everyone agreed to use the same API.  The only way Fedcoin like schemes add value is if we streamline the rules around them and make them have less friction and more consistency.  I'm skeptical any large body made up of different groups of human beings will ever agree to that when some stand to lose and some stand to win money.  That's not a consensus system I would bet money on if I were you.

We do create an address for you during registration in order to make sales and sends easier to facilitate, but we don't control the keys.  The private keys are generated in your browser using information you know that is entered into your browser.  We store your encrypted private keys, but never see them in plaintext.
So correct, that's it really.  We will arguably make a small amount of "float" while we wait for ACH debits to clear and review them for fraud, but that's not a significant amount of money.  Most of it will be FX.  Because we have such a safer design, and don't have a legacy of hundreds of millions of USD in bitcoin deposits, we will have much lower IT security costs, regulatory costs (we aren't as risky from a consumer protection perspective), and equally as important, insurance costs.
We can then pass those lower costs on to our customers in the form of more favorable fees and FX rates.  That's the deal.  We have longer term plans that are a bit broader, but step 1 is to stand up Novauri.  Hope you help us out.

I'm not so sure that's a bad thing.  The more I think about it, even the nasty reputation smearing I've read recently may not be bad long term (no I don't condone it and it sickens me).
Taking a step back, all of this fighting is positive.  I guarantee this is accelerating the hardening of bitcoin service security not only at bc.i, but at competitors.
It seems like a bitcoin recession where everyone is fighting tooth and nail for scraps, but I think in hindsight that's not how we'll see this period of time.
All this is doing is accelerating the maturation of bitcoin's supporting infrastructure and pushing us faster towards one of the first major inflection points: a partial sovereign currency flight to BTC, mainstream access to BTC via retirement savings in a safe package, adoption of a killer app, or a 2.0 technology.
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:51:24
 is a good place to start.
We are built around customer control of their private keys.  We don't have an "option" to let Novauri control your money.  The entire thing is built around the idea that the customer retains control of fiat and bitcoin, and we act as an easy to use clearing service to buy and sell at competitive rates.
We do not pretend to have a magic way to eliminate payment fraud.  If I had a magic way to prevent payment fraud, I wouldn't be in the bitcoin business.  I would be a multi-billionaire and every ecommerce company in the world would be kicking down my door to use my services.
Now, I'm really damn good at eliminating payment fraud, but it's more of a security through obscurity kluge with a few twists (the first rule of fraud club is you do not talk about fraud club), knowing the industry, and having lots of battle scars, but that's not why we are doing this.  We are doing this because bitcoin is meant to be frictionless, digital cash that ends up merging with other technologies and enabling financial TCP/IP.  I want to help make that happen.

Well, for starters, our site never sees your private keys, so we can't steal your bitcoin.  You can inspect the JS on your end if you want to do that.  Novauri is being built in a way that even if the CEO's of Moolah or Mt. Gox were running them, they couldn't get away with the instantaneous massive owner theft, er, I mean "accidents" or "hacks" that we saw on their systems.  
I guess the other reason is that I have a team of people who ran multi-million dollar FI products and teams at large companies.  Some of us controlled the keys to financial systems where we could have simply entered files to create as much money as we wanted if we so chose, but we didn't.  You know, because we are honest. 
Then there is the guy from Moolah who was a total huckster.  He changed his name and had a history of scamming people and creating bitcoin honey pots.  And who calls things "tasty"?

Was the world a better place before the petrodollar?  I seem to remember a series of "world wars" with an arms race that ended with the development of fission and then fusion based weapons.  This was all before the petrodollar brought us "perpetual war". 
The problem with this type of dogmatic thinking is it fails to consider what would happen in the power vacuum if the "evils" it focuses on were suddenly no longer in control.  I'm sure you assume that some group that you agree with ideologically would assume control and the world would turn into a utopia.  Perhaps you think we could survive without any government, and that decentralized systems would make authority obsolete.  I'm a little murky on how decentralized tech will prevent stronger people from taking advantage of weaker people, however.
The big question: how is your ideology going to make the world a better place when it is in power?  Do you have any historical precedent or proof that it will scale?  What are you bringing to the table, and how can we be certain it will work?
We may have economic issues, and our monetary policy is certainly not what I would call perfect, but no one has nuked each other since power was established.  I'm not saying we can't progress from here, but I think you need to share your plan and do some convincing.

Maybe.  I'm pretty conservative when it comes to these things.  It was extremely difficult to get the reference client of bitcoin stable and secure.  Ideas are fun, but implementing a secure cryptocurrency that gains widespread adoption is not easy.  There are legions of hand waving sales people who create convincing arguments for why a 2.0 will succeed.  
What goes unsaid is that with protocols there is a huge first mover advantage and network effect, and nothing can change that.  Bitcoin is an infrastructure, not a product.  The second, third, or fifteenth bitcoin exchange may be the one to get it right, but we're talking about infrastructure here, not a product. 
For another cryptocurrency to become big, it needs to offer features and properties that cannot be accomplished by bitcoin proper.  Property, exchanges, stocks, futures, even debt can all be linked on the blockchain.   I think systems that store encrypted data, or handle more complex rule sets are good candidates for 2.0's.  I like counterparty, namecoin, ethereum just because it's cool, and I really hope Storj and Maidsafe can overcome some of the core economic and technical issues around long term storage and redundancy, because they are huge ideas too.
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:54:03
That nitpick is an argument for why JS based crypto in conjunction with SSL/TLS is more secure than just SSL/TLS, not less secure.  Why then come here and spend time blasting bc.i for their security when you know full well that this type of attack would affect any web wallet regardless of whether they uses JS or not?
This is almost certainly a coordinated hit job against bc.i.  I cannot prove it yet, but with time it will come out.  I don't believe it will work.  
I'm watching all of the posts by users with no post history claiming things or smearing, and the others that come here and obfuscate issues that affect all web wallets in such a way that they make it seem like it's somehow specific to bc.i, and I keep thinking to myself... 
Who benefits?  Competing wallet developers or people who have an axe to grind due to failed business relationships.  Probably not one group either.
Do they benefit, however?  People see this stuff and they aren't going to go sign up for others that have been "mentioned" as alternatives in these smear threads.  They are not going to understand local JS vs server java, python or rails.  They aren't even going to understand that bc.i =/ bitcoin.  These people are going to log out of reddit and tell their friends about how unsafe BITCOIN is because it's dangers have been so greatly exaggerated through this brand and reputation hit job.
This hurts everyone, and the people behind it need to be exposed.  It's not hard to see who "piled on".  That, and oh, and I'm keeping screenshots and a timeline, you know, just in case...

Getblocktemplate.  That solves almost all the issues with pooled mining.  The risk we would still face would be someone buying 51% of the computing power, but at least this would mitigate pools.

That's not ~~how~~ the only way it works.  You can buy coins from my service and we'll send them to an address you registered to your profile that is from your personal wallet.  By registering an address, you affirm that you control it.  There is no step where you log in and send coins from Novauri to your wallet.  We send them to the address you specify.
If you sell, we can't sell from your wallets without access to your private keys, so we create a wallet for you during registration.  The trick is, the private key to the "Novauri wallet" is derived from information you know, and is created locally in browser, and you are encouraged to backup the private key so you can take it with you.
We'll have multi-sig shortly after beta, but Novauri never has more than 1 key.  I can't go into detail on that one yet, but it's going to be pretty awesome.


I don't know if that's happening with bitcoin addresses.  My company won't be engaging in this sort of surveilance, but it's possible an agency could force us to use a list that was created using this type of information.  
I will say that this type of thing is absolutely happening with bank accounts, but that's not news.  Also, bank accounts are tied to a verified identity.

I agree completely, there's a network effect with bitcoin.  The telephone has more in common with bitcoin than the television.  While the TV required broadcasting companies to create programming more useful than radio audio, the telephone required lines, operators, and ultimately participants who owned telephones and were hooked up through the last mile.  Bitcoin doesn't need the lines, operators, or even the physical telephone, but it does require installation of a wallet application or registration with a web service, as well as setting up funding from a traditional bank account.
So the obstacles for bitcoin are network participation.  Network participation requires 1) opening or installing a wallet, 2) getting a funding source set up 3) buying bitcoin and finally 4) participating in the economy.
1-4 are what we need to make easier to do.

The fact that you take compensation as an advisor to companies competing with Coinbase, come here to reddit, make highly public posts about security issues, then recommend people move their money away and separately recommend the the companies putting you on the payroll is arguably unethical.
I'm beginning to wonder if you don't target companies that won't pay you as an advisor.  I recall you recently going after blockchain.info as well.  This seems highly coincidental to me.

I can see how you might think that, but I really do mean negative feedback loop.  Over the last year we've seen very low volatility compared to the past.  It's been a steady bleed of a decline, like air being let out of a balloon slowly.  The negative feedback loop is the price decline slowly hurting miners who must sell their winnings, which takes away demand again.  If that feedback loop were to continue indefinitely, it could lead to zero.   I don't think it will, because people are already value investing in bitcoin.  I think we've hit a floor.  
"A positive feedback loop" on the downside would look more like a deflation after hyperinflation where a currency goes to zero very quickly, or an over-leveraged asset class (like CDO's) that implodes on itself because it's a house of cards based on a negative real market valuation.  That's another doomsday scenario as well, but I think that's also unlikely.

Bitcoin isn't a Rube Goldberg Machine.  It looks that way to an economist/lawyer/political scientist who doesn't understand the cryptography/technology, or an engineer who doesn't understand the economic systems baked into it.


It's not "the blockchain".  "The blockchain" is a transaction history, a ledger.  It's bitcoin or "the blockchain" doesn't work.
 


Remittance and exchange between different sovereign powers with 0 friction and no middle men is absurd.  States have interests to protect and don't agree sometimes, see Crimea, Ukraine, and the mysterious crash in oil prices that decimated the value of Russia's currency.

I couldn't agree more.  These services are not wallets in any sense of the word.  Calling them wallets is misleading.
These are bitcoin brokerages with a pooled bitcoin bank account feature.  Coinbase has a wallet option in their "vault", but it's an option only for "advanced" users.
Considering that this flawed bitcoin bank design is the ongoing cause of service collapse after service collapse, isn't it about time to classify these services along with their risk profile accordingly?  
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:32:05
This is exactly right.  As soon as a financial services company grows out of being small, complex regulatory environments are no longer seen as issues or opportunities for improvement, but as the reality and environment in which they do business.  
Remember, a larger company has already invested millions into complying with the existing regulatory environment.  Why would one of these companies want to encourage change?  They have a huge sunk cost in complying with the system as it exists.  On top of this, the system they are complying with serves as a huge barrier to entry for small competitors.
It's really not all that complicated, and the companies aren't "bad" or "evil", they are just acting in their best interests.  Regulators need to be very careful when passing new rules.  Someday we can hopefully get to a place where rules are updated on a very regular basis and have a mandatory expiration.  This is desperately needed in the financial services industry and would be a major catalyst for innovation and modernization.

This seems to be the place to post if you want down votes, so here I am.
1) Not agreeing with something on moral or ideological grounds is not the same as it being illegal.  Slapping a "classified" label on illegal activity should not make revealing that illegal activity a crime.  If we allow this, you just gave whoever has the "classified" stamp infinite power to do whatever they want.
2) As the 2nd and 3rd Century Roman jurist Paul so succinctly put it:


This is as close to a fundamental right for advanced society as any.  It's known more commonly to us Murican's (I can tell you are one) as "Innocent until proven guilty".  
The idea is, in any situation there exists an asymmetrical balance of power, and the rule of law must protect the weak from the strong, even if the weak are revealing violations or criminal activity on the part of the strong.
Without this and other fundamental rights forming a foundation for our systems of law, we might as well just call it a day and sign up for a hopefully benevolent and very different form of government.

As someone who is familiar with ecosystems, you'll appreciate their complexities.  Sometimes participants in an ecosystem eat each other for food (e.g. hostile takeovers).  They may fight for territory (competition).   Sometimes symbiotic relationships are formed (Strategic partnerships).  Sometimes participants will form parasitic relationships and bleed a host for food, or betray their host for the benefit of a different organism entirely (some lawyers).  
And then once in a great while,  sometimes a giant meteor will fall from the sky.  It will wipe out apex predators and entire orders of life, forcing punctuated equilibrium and rapidly accelerated evolution orders of magnitude faster than normal as some form of life fills the void previously occupied by extinct species (e.g. the printing press, antibiotics, chemical fertilizer, telephone, combustion engine, electricity… or… the rise of distributed consensus systems - i.e. bitcoin) You see my point?
With Circle and Coinbase I haven't attacked and belittled anyone directly.  Quite the contrary, I've defended Circle when they were being attacked pretty viciously.  I have immense respect for their CEO.  He’s achieved more in his career than most of us could dream of before starting Circle.  I congratulated Coinbase on the option to let their customers keep key control in their vault, even if that option was a bit overdue.  
I think Nick Szabo said it best:


So please understand, I’m not writing anything to be cruel, but I’m not going to mince words.  Bitcoin was meant to be frictionless, digital cash.  It’s not an improved online shopping currency that works better in some ways but not others retrofitted into a hollowed out bank vault to be managed by the same rules as credit networks, ACH, or antiquated systems designed before most here were born.  That meteor has touched down, most don’t know it yet, and we are just seeing time on a much slower scale as the changes unfold.  Bitcoin is going to become all sorts of things that no one is predicting.  It may take a long time, but if you believe in it then I feel you have a responsibility to the community and to improving the condition of humanity to move it forward however you can.  We need to be working to help existing institutions feel more comfortable and provide answers for them, not to encourage them to prematurely create restrictions or roll over for profits.  
I think being direct is completely called for in this situation.  And related to contributions to bitcoin?  I were to look at who was contributing the most to bitcoin right now, I certainly wouldn’t put Coinbase, Circle, or even my service Novauri on that list even after it launches.  No way...
I would put the people who are pushing the edges of the technology, creating disruptive ideas like side chains, tweaking ethereum, participating in the debates, and of course donating their time to work on the core development.  I would list people who invented and then implementing stealth addresses.  I would list people who are WAY out there in the clouds theorizing about ways to integrate machine learning algorithms, game theory with bitcoin so that software intelligence can compete and evolve against itself.  People considering using delivery drones that use bitcoin as an automated payment and settlement system, those dreaming of delivering holographic service across the globe (doctors, therapists, counselors) that can be paid in bitcoin.  Those dreaming up micro transaction economies to bring the rest of the world into the financial system.  These are the pioneers.
I’m truly sorry if you feel I’m too terse, but this is who I am.

Never order a product that doesn't exist if you are not willing to lose the amount you paid.  Preordering vapor products under development is essentially providing venture capital for free.  You aren't preordering a video game and it does not matter if the founders are trustworthy.  Much can go wrong developing new products, these guys haven't done it before, and any big cost overrun can lead to the entire thing never happening.

That seems like a really complicated solution that doesn't solve the fiat side of the issue.  
If I am insolvent and have a service with cash and bitcoin deposits, I can simply operate my cash side on a fractional reserve basis to have bitcoin solvency.  That is, buy 100% of bitcoin customers deposited but have maybe only 20% of cash deposits on hand.  As long as there is no bank run on the cash side, voila!  I'm passing your real time Merkle sum solvency proof hand waviness but am actually insolvent with fiat. I could take loans or more convertible debt too and say it's for "business expansion" if I was totally screwed.  I could leverage up on derivatives.  Plenty of tricks.  Ask Arthur Andersen!
The problem is it's a two sided coin: fiat and crypto.  You have to audit all their books at the same time as a crypto proof of reserves.  That's a brilliant plan for the crypto side, but I'll just trick you using old school accounting fraud.  I mean, hypothetically.  I'm not a crook.

The question isn't if the average computer's processor, ram, motherboard, and storage can handle 20mb blocks.
The questions are:
1) can the amateur afford hardware to host a 20mb or 200mb block size after a few years, or are we forcing people to buy enterprise hardware to run a bitcoin node and...
2) what does this do to block propagation time in the live network when blocks 10 to 100 times larger need to move through a chain of acceptance to propagate to the entire network?
1 and 2 add similar risks.  
Storing bigger blocks may force centralization of full nodes and force little people to use SPV implementations, which potentially reduces the security of the network, and absolutely makes bitcoin inaccessible to the curious or the enthusiast. 
Both storing and transmitting bigger blocks makes 0 confirmation confidence checks harder to do for "in lane" retail or online shopping transactions.  Both also make selfish mining or similar schemes or double spend confirmation frauds much easier to commit. 
I really preferred a gradual increase of a set % incrementally just below the average fixed absolute value of the long term % decrease in broadband costs.  Broadband costs drop slower than storage and processing decreases, so this is the right benchmark to use.  Is there a reason we have to go completely bananas and compete with paypal tomorrow?  Do we need to transmit blocks via radio so we have instant propagation to all nodes with one hop???

[Support Novauri...](
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:28:07
Will from Novauri here.  
[You may want to sign up for Novauri's US Beta at  starting in early 2015.](
Novauri lets you buy and sell bitcoin but isn't designed like a bank.  We never have control of your private keys, and your bitcoin funds are always in your control.  That means we cannot "freeze" your bitcoin addresses and operate 100% on blockchain.  You can walk away from our service with your private keys and use another service or program for bitcoin at any time, with or without our permission.
We also allow you to bring your own wallet.  If you want to buy using Novauri and have the funds send directly to a third party address like a paper or hardware wallet, we don't care.
[We still have to follow rules and regulations, but we're as open as we can be about how we comply with them.  Read more here.](  
Our design makes us safer for everyone, because there is no systemic risk of catastrophic internal theft that keeps happening over and over with badly designed services that use hot and cold wallets and operate off blockchain.  
It also means that we operate at a lower cost basis so we will be cheaper in the long run.  We don't have to pay for all of the expensive security, insurance, and higher regulatory burden associated with the poor design decision of creating a bitcoin bank.
There's more coming after our beta as well, find out more at our website.  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-15 08:04:16
Novauri does not control your private keys and therefore cannot "freeze" your bitcoin.
[**Support us by signing up for Novauri's US closed beta and we will waive your transaction fees on purchases and sales forever!**](   
When we begin our closed beta in March/April of 2015, our service will let you buy and sell bitcoin, but we never have control of your private keys &amp; wallet.  This means we are effectively "Gox proof" with 100% of our customer accounts, not as an option.  Our service will have high security; 2FA is mandatory.  You still should still not store large amounts of bitcoin on our site, and if you do we WILL actively nag you about getting it off Novauri, referring you to more secure options.  
We do still need to verify your identity if you plan to trade over $3000 daily, and we must follow many rules and regulations.  I can guarantee you that we will never let you start using your account with one level of KYC rules and then change the rules after you are our customer.  
I'm not sure what you say happened with Coinbase, and I'm not going to comment without knowing more or seeing proof (this subreddit is full of astroturf and outright lies), but I do know that this type of thing was reported as occurring at a very popular exchange and another business in Canada.  
I see that as highly irresponsible and suspicious - likely an indicator that the business conducting the activity is operating on a fractional reserve basis in secret because they took a HUGE loss... like what probably was happening since 2011 at Gox.  It's a red flag. Why?  Here is why:
1) these companies should have been obeying the bank secrecy act all along (you should be in jail for money laundering if you are letting customers trade more than $3000/day without verifying customer ID in the US,) and 
2) if you are suddenly going to start obeying the law, as almost all of these services were not for quite some time, you should at least return funds to the addresses from which they were received as an optional refund and not use the regulation as an excuse to create a bitcoin honey pot trap!
If a customer needs to pass an identity check, you give them the ID check BEFORE you take deposits.  You don't take deposits, freeze them, and then demand an ID check.  That's incredibly unethical and completely backwards.  I know the claim is that funds would be forking over to the authorities, but the reality is, the escheatment will probably take years if it ever happens, and they will be using that bitcoin to profit as collateral on derivatives markets for years in the mean time.  
That's a really scummy way to earn a profit, and we want no part of it.  I think using regulation as an excuse to trap funds is either a sign of incompetence, illegal activity, a coverup of a catastrophic loss or negligence, or some or all of the above.
So we're building a service that can't freeze funds and really just acts as a passthrough.  We allow fully support your ability to add 3rd party addresses, so if you want to add your Blockchain.info addresses and use a wallet service that specializes in just doing that better than a brokerage service can, that's up to you.  We'll even send your bitcoin purchases to whatever address you specify directly, without you having to do the "bitcoin bank shuffle" where you move your bitcoin off to a paper wallet every time you buy.  We don't pretend to be a bank, put you at risk, give you a false sense of security underinsuring total deposits, or give you a headache.
Think I'm making all of this up about bitcoin banks, fractional reserve, and scams?  [Click this because I'm not.  Did you know that almost 10% of all bitcoin has been stolen because of business models exactly like every service you probably use today to buy and sell bitcoin?](

The author of this "opinion" doesn't understand how the blockchain site works, and his story doesn’t add up.
"Recently the same happened to me. I had generated a bitcoin address to receive a specific payment. The funds had been sent to the address and appeared in my wallet.
Almost instantly I was kicked out of my wallet and was required to log in again. After logging in, the address had disappeared from my wallet along with the coins. There was no time to backup the private key from instantly being kicked."
This is not how the site presently works.  For new wallets:
1) You create a wallet with an email address/alias and a password
2) You are prompted to write down a mnemonic phrase (I take it you skipped this step with the big red warning text about losing your bitcoin?)
3) It logs you out before you see your address
4) You must log back in with the credentials you just created
THEN you could have accessed the address and sent bitcoin there.  
So, assuming you aren't lying to us, you did 1-4 with a new wallet, logged back in, then saw the bitcoin hit the address, saw the balance, were kicked out, and when you logged back in... and the “address” was not there?   
Did you write down the recovery phrase?
Also, why are certain other wallets repeatedly mentioned here as an alternative?  This feels like a sleazy FUD post to me.

Great links.  If you triangulate all of this, it's pretty clear how many people are out there.
The thing is, worrying about the user count completely misses the point.  Even the transaction volume (assuming it can't be inflated easily for very little money) isn't the point.  
The point is the next killer application.  In truth, the first killer app for bitcoin was as a currency for drug markets.  It was a tiny market, and no where close to the size of cash based black markets, but let's call a spade a spade.
Since then, price appreciation is largely speculation by people who understand how incredibly brilliant bitcoin is, and that it solves fundamental problems that can't be solved another way, in addition to having a huge network effect as the first mover.  That isn't a killer app, it's speculation that there will be more killer apps.
The next killer app won't be an online shopping mobile app or replacement for a credit card.  It will be something very few realize they need, but after they have it won't want to imagine life without it.
User counts and numbers are fodder for accountants and analysts.  What we need is the next killer app to get traction.  Personally, I think there are a few already out there that are just getting off the ground.  Obvious candidates: decentralized markets (stock, commodity, bond, currency, auctions, services), P2P payments integration with torrent file sharing on p2p networks, pirate-proof files, high efficiency international remittances, decentralized ID, programmable contracts, economic "fuel" for AI.  As soon as ANY of these are productized in a competent way that sticks, BOOM.  Hello moon.

Love it!  40% is the ideal rate; it should stay under the extrapolated broadband growth ceiling in addition to instructions per second and storage cost efficiency gains.
Just for precision's sake, and to satisfy my deep seated OCD, humor me and take a second look at your double epoch.
double_epoch = ~~6~~ 6.609263245x24x ~~365~~ 365.25x2 = ~~105120~~ 115873.60321134
365 is slightly off.  365.25 is much closer as it includes leap year.
Block time of 10 minutes is 6x24x365.25 is the target, but what we see in reality is that block time is not 10 minutes, but 9.078167684 minutes.  The difficulty readjustments every 2016 blocks always tail into increases in hash power, which is why we see nearly a 10% faster block confirmation time.
[This figure is based on this data from 2011 averaged out for every block confirmation through today.](
I think it's safe to assume that as the number of transactions grows, fee profit grows and offsets coinbase revenue gains, we can extrapolate the same increases in hashing power.
You might want to tweak the math to make sure we come in at 40%.  I didn't want to hack up that marvelous sheet, but I think you may be a little low.

It's absolutely true.  You can literally inspect the javascript file you receive from them and your network traffic.  Also, there's an extension you can install that bypasses the JS download risk all together.  
In the event they did monkey with the JS or someone outside did a nasty MITM on a service, it still limits the risk of fraud to incremental losses - i.e. they still cannot rob everyone all at once.  It's extremely unlikely that a "gox" will happen with blockchain.info because of the design.  That's not true with banks that control your private keys.  Regardless of how they perform their internal security there's always the possibility of 2 or more employees colluding or working with people on the outside to steal everything.  Preventing that costs a lot of money, and absolutely introduces risk.
So with bitcoin banks you are relying on the internal security of the company to not have their hot and cold wallets hacked and lose everything all at once.  With web wallets that do not store plaintext private keys, they systemic risks are much lower and incremental not catastrophic, all things being equal.  
Much of it comes down to the competence and security of the company itself, but web wallets that are designed to never see your keys intentionally are a fundamentally more secure design, especially if they incorporate 2FA or multisig into their scheme and avoid common design flaws.

The message on their site says that they were preserving the original hardware for forensic investigation, so they probably don't know what happened at this point.  If a gun was pointed to my head and I had to guess, my bet would be a non-executive level employee either stole the funds, or conspired with someone on the outside to steal the funds by giving them a way in.  
From their news bulletin, they clearly weren't using multi-sig in their back office wallets, which would indicate that a single individual on the inside or outside could pull it off.  
Glad to see them going with bitgo.  I recently had a demo of their stuff, and I imagine it is likely just what bitstamp needed if the issue was an insider.

Of this demographic?  Probably 1%.  If/when things go facebook, 0.01%.  
The thing is, that 1% or 0.01% will post it all over bitcointalk, and twitter the moment they find it, limiting the damage.
No one is likely to "find" a vulnerability with a bitcoin bank-designed exchange or brokerage like Gox, Stamp, Circle, or Coinbase (their multi-sig vault notwithstanding) before it causes a catastrophe.  If businesses operating on that model get hit with insider or outsider fraud, it's almost always going to be big and very bad.
That's not just my opinion, it's based on the history of how services fail.  You might call me a bit of a student of this subject.

There is no "pipe dream".  Can we please have a conversation that is based on quantifiable fact or extrapolation?
If you run the numbers by extrapolating long term trends in computing, storage, and broadband cost decreases...
Storage capacity halves in cost every 14 months, give or take (potential bottleneck).
Computing power halves in cost every 18 months (middle bottleneck).
Network broadband connectivity halves in cost every 24 months (likely bottleneck).
If you extrapolate storage capacity alone, and assume the 1mb / 10 minute size is the maximum acceptable for the home enthusiast today, and we stick with the standby 7 transactions / second for 1mb of size,  the math is that at the same price point, that 1MB cap can increase by 85.7% annually and remain attainable.  
If you do the math this means home enthusiasts can support:
* 5 years: 83 trx/s
* 10 years: 1,838 trx/s
* 15 years: 40,594 trx/s (= peak VISA volumes today)
* 20 years: 1,000,000 trx/s (more than enough for a ubiquitous, transnational decentralized currency system)
The bottleneck isn't storage capacity, it's broadband.  Broadband is SLOW.  By year 20, we only hit 15,518 trx/second.  It takes beyond year 22 to support just VISA peak volumes.
This means we need a leap frog in block transmission.  Radio propagation might work.  This is your bottleneck.
Storage capacity is least likely to cause an issue, so why are we artificially discussing forcing the size so high that it KILLS the ability for enthusiasts to tinker?  
Sorry, but that's plain dumb and even smells a little fishy.

Blockchain.info is fine as a web wallet.  They had a few bugs but fixed them and made the customers whole.  They were also targeted by a sophisticated MiTM attack that would have breached any online bitcoin wallet.
The thing people forget is that blockchain has a superior design to services designed as bitcoin banks.  If blockchain screws up, the damage to customers is only as they log in or create accounts under broken code.  If a bitcoin bank screws up or hires dishonest employees who are really just after cold and hot wallets, well, they can lose most or all depositor bitcoin instantly.
That's not conspiracy theory, it's how almost 10% of bitcoin has been stolen.

The point isn't to make running a full node accessible for people who don't care (not that I agree with you in the least that there aren't 50 year old people in the US South or people in an African Country who might want to do so), it's to make the option accessible and affordable for people who want to run a full node.
The point isn't to let people have a hobby.  The point is to keep the network's nodes from becoming centralized.  If only a thousand entities are running nodes, it's much easier for a given Country to regulate the handful of nodes in their Country and control them, or for a region to do this with a bunch of Countries in tandem.
Centralization of nodes has the potential to be as damaging as mining centralization, and I don't see the point of letting the block size become enormous and forcing centralization when there isn't even a problem with our 7 trx/second cap, presently.
A more gradual increase makes much more sense and has no downside.  It's not like people have to raise the fees they are paying right now because no one will mine their transactions...

It requires mining, but it doesn't require the consumer electronic devices to mine.  Unless there is a heat recovery product like a space heater where the heat is put to productive use, this type of scheme cannot compete cost effectively with industrial mining rigs.  If the cost of electricity is subsidized, sure, but I don't see that as a huge draw.
What's more likely is that they are looking to standardize hardware wallets and put real security around bitcoin.  I bet they are building a software stack around this too.  I bet they are also including a mining chip, but the play isn't to compete cost effectively, it's either to create really friendly mining software to standardize the transaction confirmation rules to bring down confirmation times de facto, or to create a network of nodes/pools/mining operations that observe certain rules that support micropayments and other types of functionality.
The last one has to be handled delicately or they could end up drawing the wrath of the bitcoin community.  In 5 years, that may not matter though.

Hi, this is Will from Novauri.  We're accepting sign ups for our closed beta release, which is on track for March or April of 2015.  Our rates will be extremely competitive, and if you sign up now, we'll waive your transaction fees on bitcoin purchases and sales forever.
It really bothers us that every major service today that lets you buy and sell bitcoin also wants to control your private keys.   It bothers us even more given that these same services have started to freeze assets in the name of "KYC".  Of course that's completely ridiculous, as the controls for knowing your customer are supposed to be when you open your account, not as an excuse to keep your money after you've made a deposit.  
Why should you trust a bitcoin bank that has never had an independent financial audit of both fiat and bitcoin that insures a tiny fraction of total deposits? Especially when so many of them have been hacked?
Equally scary is the alternative, using a service that matches you with a local stranger who hopefully is honest and not a violent criminal.
Well we think that not having a choice sucks, and this is why we are building Novauri.  Our design philosophy is simple: build a bitcoin purchase and sale service that builds on bitcoin’s strengths and keeps users in control of their money.  With Novauri your money is fully controlled by you.  We don’t pool funds or have access to your private keys.  Novauri runs on proven technologies and is designed from the ground up by a team with many decades of experience building high risk financial products.  Security like two-factor authentication and secondary passwords are standard.  
Oh, and there's another thing.  Because we don't pretend to be a bank, we don’t have to pay for the expensive security and insurance required to keep shared deposits safe.  Our average prices will be lower than competitors because we are designed to be safe and don’t act like a bitcoin bank.
We believe the community wants an alternative that respects you enough to let you control your money.  Please sign up for our beta to prove the demand is there.  Our beta will go live in March or April of 2015.  
Please show us your support and sign up.  We won't spam you with email, and will keep what little information we are asking for safe.  Thanks.

Novauri isn't a mass adoption play or consumer financial services bank knockoff.  It's a semi-decentralized boutique exchange that offers user controlled wallet architecture with 3rd party wallet friendly functionality.  We're not trying to do anything more than this with Novauri in terms of a consumer play.  The exchange was always meant to be a pilot so we could develop a platform that other wallets can use to buy and sell bitcoin in order to outsource compliance risk in a way that doesn't require them to work with a partial competitor.  That's our market, it's not consumer direct.  It's an engine.
If we decide to go consumer direct, and we have seriously considered it, we'll likely rename it to something else.
That said, I think conventional wisdom about naming companies so people can read them with 3rd grade educations is overblown.  
What if I named the service "Francois Depardieu"?  You would probably not like that.  Yet the  most valuable brand in the world is "Louis Vuitton".   "Cisco".  What the @ is a Cisco you say?  It's the  most valuable brand in the world, that's what.  "Disney", what is a Disney?  A "Marlboro"?  Verizon? That sounds like something you should see a doctor about.  What about Prada, Adidas, or Allianz?  Are any of these more or less confusing than "Novauri"?  Not really.
The truth is, bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream, and the users of the service could care less what it's called, they care that it doesn't try to take control of their bitcoin.
Look, I am a user of bitcoin and have been for nearly five years.  I am 100% confident I could name this service antidisestablishmentarianismconfusingbucks.com and people would want to use it.  Why???  
Because we are the only US exchange service that isn't building a retrostyle bank around bitcoin.  We're letting users control their private keys.  We don't make our users jump through hoops, and our values are right down the center on this.  That's what matters.  It's not about fancy interfaces, marketing or other BS with bitcoin early adopters.  It's about ideas and values.  
Wait and see if our ideas and values matters to the people who actually use bitcoin.  See if they become our customers and abandon companies that invested millions in fancy marketing, naming, and color choices.  We'll see.

You realize I didn't even so much as mention my company and this was 100% a blog post about Fedcoin, right?  If I was scamming people, do you think I would have spent the last 7 months making sure the service was safe?  Wouldn't we just release it and steal everyones' money?  Oh, and would we put our personal bios up on the site?  Also, notice half of us are over the hill?  No one can outrun the police on my team except a few of the young ones.  We're all scarred up ex-financial services people who have worked in this industry all of our lives, had plenty of opportunities to do bad things, but didn't.  We're not fraudsters. Wow, just wow.

and you are removing my post because the guidelines state that "trades" are not accepted?  specifically flagged down a moderator to make up a new rule to specifically target my post because you don't like it?  Are you serious?
Hint, those companies Lucas mentioned already DO post jobs here and have for YEARS.  I'm trying to get a startup off the ground and you are targeting me unfairly while leaving my competition completely untouched!
You sure weren't deleting [Coinbase's posts](  And there are dozens more by Coinbase by the way.  Search if you don't believe me.

I could keep going, there are countless more posts, and I think you get the point.  
First, a ban on "trading" bitcoin has nothing to do with posting jobs, and second, removing my posts hiring developers while leaving other companies intact is picking and choosing winners.
You either need to post a rule that is consistently enforced on all companies, or let people hire talent in this subreddit.  Personally, with 90% of the stuff in this subreddit as viral marketing BS, I fail to see how an actual job for developers hiring from the community is a bad thing, but whether my opinion is right or not is irrelevant, your conduct removing my post is inconsistent and unfair.
I would like to get clarification on what seems to me to be the inconsistent enforcement of forum rules that don't exist.

UPDATE: solved!  Impressive.   The solution details are available by clicking on the link above.  The original message follows below.  We'll do another one of these again soon.
Novauri is a US bitcoin brokerage under development since late 2014. 
**We are renaming ourselves bridge21.**
bridge21 features a 100% user controlled wallet design that keeps your bitcoin in your control at all times. You don’t have to trust us, because we never have access to you private keys. Our service is designed to work with 3rd party wallets as well, so you can buy bitcoin and have it sent directly to your paper or hardware wallet. We’re very close, and planning to start our public beta in late Q3 or early Q4. Stay tuned and sign up on our home page.
**Enough, show me the money.**
We decided to do something clever when promoting our new name.  
[This link]( goes to a page with an image.  The image is a riddle.  If you figure out the answer, run it through SHA256 one time. The hash in hex is a bitcoin private key. The first lucky winner who figures it out controls an address with ONE MILLION BITS.
If no one gets it in a day or two, we'll drop some hints.  Good luck!

Here's the thing...  You know "the government"?  It's made up of people.  The overlapping boards of the transnational corporations?  Also people.  
People evolved from primates, who evolved from rodent like mammals, who evolved from mammal like reptiles, and not too long before that we were all amphibians.  
Reptiles didn't have "supposed to" or "rights".  They ate each other.  The biggest reptile lived, and the little ones were eaten. 
We're not that much different today.  The people who hustle make it to the top, and the ones that wait get the scraps.  Unfortunately most that make it to the top had to do some pretty competitive things to beat everyone else out and get there, and some of that almost invariably was what passive people sitting around waiting would call immoral, unethical, or whatever.
Now, do you think the people who were hungry and ate the little fish, and did anything they could to work their way to the top care about keeping the "government" operating at the same level as "the people"?
Hell no.  They ate the people to get up there.  They want to keep eating people and use the government to stay at the top.  And don't think for a minute that if the people being eaten were at the top that it would be any different.  Within a few weeks they would be eating their old masters.
Sorry state of human affairs, but yeah, best get a reality check.  The more we can do to replace things involving humans with math, the better off we're going to be.  Unless it involves giant killer robots.  That might be bad, especially if they also like to eat people.

Should have been deleted???  Come on...  If you consider hiring someone advertising a "trade", then you have a lot of deleting to do.
The companies in this industry mostly trade as their core product.  Any exchange or brokerage that announces they are now doing business in NY (e.g. Coinsetter on the front page right now) is advertising a trade of $$$ for bitcoin to anyone in the entire state of NY!  That actually is an advertisement for a trade in a massive scale, as opposed to you two picking on my tiny startup that is trying to find a single ruby developer to fix our UX up a bit.
Either rewrite the guidelines to be clear, and stop stretching the definition of a "trade" to things that it doesn't apply to.  Better yet, stop censoring the subreddit.  This is the stuff of a mass exodus in the making, right here.  Completely unbelievable!

What is wrong with buying coffee on the blockchain?  Some really sloppy but close enough math, one mb of storage costs around $0.000024 and allows 1 transaction per second for an average block, or around 4,000 transactions on one mb.  If There are around 4,000 active nodes, the cost to store that cup of coffee us $0.000024.  If there are 400,000 nodes, it's $0.0024.
That cost drops precipitously, way faster than broadband growth rates, 100% every 1.5 years.  Sorry, I am not seeing why we can't plan on using bitcoin to buy coffee economically, especially with Moore's law and spv clients.

Even if you somehow agree with this laughably dangerous ideology that letting some people monitor everyones' electronic communications is a net benefit for society, and the benefits outweigh the costs, even if he ever pulled it off, forcing software companies to incorporate back doors into their products and then giving access to general law enforcement would cause so much identity theft and financial fraud that it simply wouldn't work.  Smart criminals would simply use older versions of open source software or create their own, everyone else would have their information at risk, but I guess David gets to be a peeping tom.
I really don't get it. Even if this guy was literally bought and 100% paid for by Satan himself, even Satan would know that the damage this would cause to his existing sources of revenue would outweigh the benefit of being able to spy on everyone and read his neighbor's mail.  Satan would say, well, sure I would love to read all of your communications and use that information to plot how I can damn your souls to eternal damnation, but it would mean that my eCommerce companies would no longer be profitable.  I would have to lay off a lot of demons and probably delay the next war by a few quarters.  Satan would quickly tell old Davie to rethink his position on encryption.

I think UXTO is probably only going to be a problem for miners who need to validate new blocks quickly for profit.  Nodes can just use SSD storage to store the UXTO.  If we don't let the transaction rate increase too rapidly, the UXTO growth will stay under storage growth short term.  UXTO growth was never a threat long term, at least after the dust issue was fixed.  
But hey, write a white paper.  Would love to see it.  Sounds like a practical thing to do.

We either need decentralized payment systems, many more payment systems so there is competition, or, if we are stuck with an oligopoly, the last and least desirable better outcome is to have some basic rights around access to the handful of payment systems backed by legal precedent.

I have six points:
1) I think makes an excellent point above and I largely agree.
2) Whatever legal proceedings issues purportedly involving this individual have absolutely no bearing or relevance to the statements made by the individual, because the statements stand on their own and do not rely on the individual's honesty to be true.  
3) Posting links to off topic legal proceedings and tying it to someone's reddit handle during a debate about an entirely different topic is doxing.  You are making a clear attempt to smear this person's reputation in an attempt to either shame them publicly and/or take credibility away from their points without addressing the points directly.  
4) I find this type of behavior to be distasteful, intellectually dishonest, and in stark contrast with the type of open, fact based discussions I feel we should be having about this subject. 
5) I think you should delete the content of those posts immediately.
6) I think you should win arguments with logic and facts, rather than with red herrings and character assassination.
Edit: I see you have a personal gripe with this person.  It's a shame that you have to derail this debate with personal issues.  It would be a lot more dignified if you deleted the content of those posts and settled your disputes elsewhere.

A 40% annual rate of increase would also be ideal so we never have to revisit this mess again.  Ever.

Lighting is neat, but people suck.  This max_block_size debate has been politically co-opted to a much greater extent than past changes.  Bitcoin isn't big enough to naturally have this level of political operation.  
I'm convinced it's the VC money in large part fueling the debate; more specifically, the need to deliver results to investors motivating involved developers to skew their perspective, even if only subconsciously.  
When you have money or a paycheck tied up in something, and you talk to other people that are paid to work on the same something all day, you naturally become affiliated and biased in favor of that something.  You learn things on a deeper level that others don't know about, and this becomes justification for diminishing everything else by comparison.  It's sure happened to me personally, and it happens to everyone all the time.
That's really unfortunate, because in the long run, I think they are cutting off their nose to spite their face!
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:41:31
So... I've been trying the whole "play dumb and let them think of it" thing and it's getting old.  
Well said.  Close... but not quite.  The entire debate is completely stupid.  You are there except for your last sentence... see 4 below.
1) Using the block size to put "pressure on fees" is completely unnecessary and idiotic.  The price of bitcoin takes care of that without requiring caps.  
There's this fear that if we don't artificially constrain the size of blocks, the price of bitcoin won't go up, miners won't make any money, and will therefore go out of business.
Newsflash, if the price of bitcoin is very low, the fees are also denominated in bitcoin so it doesn't matter. When the fees are denominated in bitcoin, the market can just adjust to a new exchange rate to value the bitcoin protocol and network.  We don't need artificial constraints.  Anyone advocating caps for this reason needs to stop.
2) Moving averages are also DUMB.  Why?  Because:
2a) we just illustrated that caps to constrain the size to force fees higher (competition for blocks) are completely redundant with the price of bitcoin that rewards miners. 
2b) transaction volumes are NOT consistent day to day or week to week.  They change drastically hour to hour.  Also, what about black friday?  What about big news that causes people to jump in or out of the market?
All moving averages do is create artificial drag on transaction volume changes.  They are stupid also.
3) Voting is stupid.  Why?  Why vote?  Miners can already cap were they like and choose transactions for blocks they solve.  Why do we need a voting dynamic?  The full nodes are the unrewarded players who are stuck with the storage space, the miners aren't.  It's just stupid, arbitrary, and dumb.  Not worth the extra complexity.  Sorry.
4) Finally... what's left?  There is a reason to stop the blocks from getting huge.  What is it?  We don't want a 10 TB download when most normal people run computers that maybe have 500 MB!  So we do need a simple cap that scales gradually.
It's about keeping full nodes accessible to normal hobbyists who don't run data centers.  Why?  Simple.  Because centralizing nodes makes the network an easier target for anyone who would like to take it down or mess with it.  No shortage of people there.
So what do you do?  A simple scaling max block size that grows just under the growth rate of the lesser of broadband, storage, and processing power.  That happens to be broadband, and the rate is 50% annually.
Set it to 8MB soon, set the stupid cap to grow at whatever interval as long as it compounds to less than 50% annually, and you have a winner. 
Anyone who says differently should be stabbed in the eye with a snail fork.
RWAAAARW.  I'm really fighting not to send this out in the dev mailing list.  You can't do that you see.  You have to play stupid and let them think they thought of it.  It's incredibly frustrating.

Get it out there, remind us to download it, and let's get this silliness over with.  I've never seen so much drama and provocation over what is essentially a configuration change in a few spots. 
No bitcoin owner and user wants centralization of nodes with a massive blockchain, it would be bad for the price.
No bitcoin owner wants permanently capped blocks, it would be bad for the price.
All bitcoin needs is the price discovery mechanics it already includes and a spam safe cap that doesn't unduly restrict adoption.

Correct.  Fractional Reserve banking doesn't collapse on itself naturally at all if the ratio of debt to GDP (using non-propagandized measurement systems) remains stable and in acceptable proportions.  
There's of course risk, because if a systemic shock (war, social uprising, incompetent or corrupt governance, etc) causes that balance to swing too far in the wrong direction, it can cause a hyperinflationary collapse.
It's not ponzi scheme at all, and great point about not requiring more members to work.  It's a massive, invisible, globally interconnected wealth redistribution system that operates entirely outside of direct public control, and partially outside of the control of the public's elected representatives.  It's sort of worked too, but it is worth thinking about other ways to make things run.
That said, and this will cause me to lose points, but I have serious concerns about social stratification in systems where there is no mechanism to re-balance wealth from the rich to the poor.
People are greedy, it's evolutionary self-preservation.  The greediest and smartest tend to accumulate the most wealth.  
There's a definite positive correlation between income gaps in societies and their subsequent collapses.  Correlation doesn't always imply causation, but it's disturbing.  It's also not a system that lets the most people lead fulfilled, relatively comfortable lives with constantly improving standards, which is a lot of the point.
If we had a hard currency that was completely untraceable and nontaxable, greatly reducing any governance system's ability to tax, the disparity between the rich and poor would likely grow, and we could unknowingly usher in an anarchistic period followed by a rebirth as a technocratic oligarchy.
I'm not a Phd in this stuff or anything, and while I'm very aware that precious metals have acted as hard currency for millennia, I'm not aware of a system of government using hard currency that didn't collapse under its own weight.  Bitcoin has many of the same properties.  I don't want any governance system controlling bitcoin, but I think socially we would need to agree to basic safety nets and to actually pay taxes for them.  I like the idea of forcing governance to actually tax to pay for spending, but I'm afraid that the peoples' willingness to pay tax (their own greed) could inadvertently cause a deflationary collapse of their own governments, with them coming out of it with something far less "free" on the other end.
I'm not saying that fractional reserve banking is the answer at all, but I'm also relatively skeptical that a world currency that is hard wouldn't fundamentally shift the world towards anarchy that would eventually reemerge with a technocratic aristocracy controlling the majority of digital cash and deciding how to spend it on their serfs.  People are greedy, and there aren't more enlightened people who will be in control when it's bitcoin.  It will still be people, and they will still be selfish even at the expense of others' lives (literally), just like now.
I don't think that will come to pass, but I have yet to see anyone figure out how to prevent this from happening or a meaningful example from history of a hard currency system working for a long time without imploding.

There are reasons some people would like to buy a non-reloadable virtual prepaid card with bitcoin directly without registering.  It could be a birthday gift, or... layering.  
The denominations are small, but if they ever go over 10k a day, BAM, you will become a provider of prepaid access.  Also, I'm guessing from the absence of any sort of agreement or privacy policy that VISA isn't authorizing the use of the brand, and you guys aren't the program managers of the card.  It's probably another virtual card, and you folks are operating a bitcoin for fiat exchange, where you buy virtual cards for fiat, and sell them to people online for bitcoin?  That makes you a money transmitter according to FinCEN.  
You also don't list their issuing bank for the prepaid card... so it's pretty clearly a non-reloadable virtual prepaid card issued by someone else and resold by these guys.
Seriously... you guys should talk to a good lawyer before you advertise or do transactions.  You need to be very careful.  FinCEN might let you off with a warning for operating an unlicensed money service business, but if they find you doing ANYTHING else remotely illegal, hello jail.  They can put you in jail for simply doing what you appear to be doing here as well, so you really need to watch out.  
I would take this offline asap and talk to a good lawyer.  Unless I am wildly off, you should also go register as a money service business with FinCEN right away.  This still doesn't clear you, but it beats doing nothing.  
Don't say I didn't warn you.  Be careful, and get legal advice.  Even call FinCEN directly and ask them.  Better safe than jail time.

Except the national debt is not like a household budget, because we create money out of thin air to make the interest payments on the debt.  When the money is created it dilutes all other money already in existence, and also devalues the debt itself that is owed.  It's a clever form of stealth taxation.

Isn't it odd the way people who actually own bitcoin seem to have similar views around what should be done with block size?
Simple, conservative increases that keep the resource requirements required to run a full node just under the decreases in cost related to network, storage and processing power for the amateur.  
No one that has a significant interest in bitcoin is going to want an extremely complicated solution to an arbitrary cap instituted to prevent spam.  Why not?  It's not an efficient solution for the problem and is highly risky (i.e. hurts bitcoin and chances are will lower the price).
They also don't want bitcoin to stagnate, or for the block size to grow at a rate that chokes adoption.  Why?  Bad for bitcoin (see price).  
They won't want it to grow super fast either, centralizing full nodes.  Why?  Centralization makes bitcoin vulnerable to attack by governments or organized groups.  Which... wait for it... hurts the price.

I get it, there's a balance between openness and wanting to go to work in the morning. 
It's easy to see why regulation is so appealing.  It's unethical to steer or railroad a debate when you have a conflicting economic interest, and even more unethical if you don't openly disclose the conflict.  In the securities world, this is called market manipulation or insider trading.  It's criminal activity.
Well, we have some unethical people, but I think we also have an obligation to avoid the temptation to regulate.  Regulation and written rules for humans create unintended consequences, feedback loops, inefficiencies, and generally freeze up progress.  This is how we ended up with the anachronistic legal and financial systems that this technology can hopefully replace someday.

Just because something is subsidized by a government doesn't make it "free".  For example, if you live in the US, the "fee" on cash is absorbed as part of the Secret Service, the US Treasury, and merchants who must handle and transport it safely.  Most of the cost is subsidized by US tax payers and merchants.
[This recent study put the cost of cash in the US alone at $200 billion.](

No one is going to "crack" the "block chain protocol".  Why not?
1) It's not called the "block chain protocol".
2) Bitcoin's cryptography is the same used by every bank and eCommerce company.  It can also be upgraded.  Hash functions regularly become obsolete when "collisions" are detected, i.e., when two different inputs produce the same digest.  There is plenty of time to upgrade to a new, more secure hash function after collisions are detected.  This happens every so often, it's not a catastrophe, and it's been considered already by those maintaining the protocol at length.
3) If collisions are detected in SHA256 or RIPEMD160, bitcoin will simply hard fork and start using more advanced hash functions.

The bolded parts were added for emphasis.  While I understand that it's difficult to work in what could be called a kiddie-pool of petulant children and provocateurs, some of the wording here concerns me and could bifurcate the community and diminish support.
The big questions will be, how does one define "professional" and "moderation"?  And, while I completely agree that the angsty teenager vibe of the dev mailing list has put off talented developers (I know quite a few who stopped reading because of the spam), and throttled corporate support, any changes to moderate communication based on a subjective definition of "ultra-aggressive" or "professional" and/or centralize control of the project might backfire.
These words will be labeled "censorship" and "centralization".  In truth, the label makers will have a valid point.
I'm not sure if this manifesto is finished, but it sounds politically charged, and this is not a great time for adding politically charged topics to the witches' cauldron of the block size debate.  I think the timing here is ill advised, and depending on what is meant by the above, the idea itself may create forks.

It seems the same right now but it's absolutely not.  
First, asymmetries in the Transferwise model require a float of local currency and arrangements with banks in receiving Countries.  A Bitcoin remittance company just needs an exchange account and a bank with access to spot currency markets.  If the company also runs the exchange the costs are significantly lower still.  It's too early and the exchanges are still thin, not terribly robust, and risky from a regulatory and infosec perspective.
The other obvious difference... Bitcoin itself has the potential to act as a currency and to some extent will, even today.
@_date: 2015-07-15 11:18:28


I agree (right now), but WU has little to fear from Transferwise as well.  Transferwise only works efficiently when the flow of currency between two Countries is roughly symmetrical.  It doesn't work for remitting money from rich to poor Countries because it functions by sending equal amounts of money locally in both Countries to offset the need for international remittance and the associated FX and correspondent banking settlement expenses.

We can raise the block size and enthusiasts can still run full nodes and not be forced into SPV clients.
Raise the block size cap by 1.254% every 2016 blocks along with difficulty and you will have a very incremental, not at all disruptive annual increase in size of 40% each calendar year.
If blocks were actually solved every 10 minutes, 1.355% would be the ideal rate, but the time is closer to 9 minutes because hash rate power increases after difficulty adjustments skew the number under 10 minutes.
I really don't see how this isn't the best of both worlds.  
1) bitcoin doesn't go off blockchain into centralized services 
2) we don't have to rely on ideas like sidechains and 
3) no one is forced out to the edges of the system, because costs will come down faster than the block size increases

Why can't the federal government offer grant money to States contingent on their participation in a national regulatory framework that is consistent?  
It's in everyones' best interest to have a single set of rules with which to comply, including consumer protection.  
This increases efficiency, lowers the cost of compliance, makes it easier to innovate, lowers costs to consumers, and helps everyone, including the States who need the tax revenue from the successful businesses that are now able to exist and grow.
It also means that there is only one set of rules that can change over time, and the amount of thought and planning that can go into changes will be much more focused.
Lawsky seems like a political guy.  Take the BitLicense to the feds, lobby to modernize the BSA and include components of the bitlicense, and then nationalize it through creation of the "Financial Modernization Act" with the associated "Financial Modernization Grant Program" where you offer each State a tidy sum in annual grant money if they replace their State regulation affecting MSB's, virtual currency exchangers/administrators with the rules in the Financial Modernization Act.

Here's a quiz to go along with your survey:
**Q:** What is the one common quality that the exchanges in your survey possess?
**A:** They all controlled their customers' private keys.
Another quiz question:
**Q:** How could these disasters been avoided, knowing that most people are lazy and will not always remember to sweep their bitcoin to a safer local or multisig wallet, and that all users are vulnerable when an exchange goes down?
**A:** Use services that aren't designed like a bank.
[Sign up for Novauri.](  We aren't a bitcoin bank.  We are a bitcoin purchase and sale service that is designed to let you keep control of your money.  When you register, you create a wallet locally in your computer.   It happens automatically and doesn't require an advanced degree in computer science either.  This HD wallet is then decrypted every time you sign in locally in your computer.   We never see the keys to your wallet, because... they are always decrypted and created locally in your computer.
That means we don't sit on millions of dollars of bitcoin that is largely uninsured and can be stolen by employees or hackers, creating sudden and violent bankruptcies.

I've read the white paper on sidechains and participated in plenty of discussions about the concept.  The issue I have with sidechains is how they are secured.  
Non-merge mined sidechains require their own consensus system, which almost always is based on proof of work or a proof of work/stake hybrid as no strictly proof of stake consensus systems have survived so far to my knowledge.
This means non-merge mined sidechain will require its own mining infrastructure that is likely to be incompatible with bitcoin's, and will, if it were to become popular, drain demand from hardware used to mine bitcoin, reduce the hash power of the network, and drop the price.  Some might see this as a "safety valve" effect, but people with a vested interest in bitcoin's price will see this as parasitic.  Bluntly, no miner or holder of bitcoin will support any non-merge mined sidechain scheme knowing that it stands to suck the life out of bitcoin and tank the price.  The problem?  These people need to agree to non-merge mined sidechains to make them possible.  So unless the cost is worth the price to those with a vested interest in bitcoin's success, I see non-merge mined sidechains as a non-starter.
Merge mined sidechains are also problematic.  First they are incredibly vulnerable if large bitcoin mining pools shift power to attack them directly.  [This is not unprecedented; see coiledcoin.](   Furthermore, merge mining still contributes to the centralization of mining because in order to be competitive with other miners, you must be able to merge mine for the biggest ROI, and setting up your rig to merge mine many side chains requires far more setup and maintenance.
I'm happy to support sidechains, but I have yet to see an implementation of the idea that isn't either harmful to bitcoin or in some way critically flawed.  I can be convinced otherwise, but haven't so far.  Feel free to try.

Forgot about 
7) BIP100 introduces the possibility of a decreasing max_block_size.  If I'm choosing to invest money into infrastructure, or maybe I nail it and find the next "killer app", now I also have the possibility of the network CONTRACTING and cutting off its ability to support my new, successful, very high transaction volume app.
What do I do?  Well, I better have a backup.  Lightning or a sidechain. Something that is shielded from these crazy miners who could vote to shrink the throughput of the network at any time.
Seriously, BIP100, it sure seems to me that this is pandering to miners in order to create political momentum so we can create more incentive to use lightning and sidechains by decreasing the predictability in throughput on the parent network.
I really don't want to think about things this way, but I believe I see how things work clearly, and this is what it looks like to me.
I don't particularly care for any solution, but at least BIP101 is predictable.  Why on earth would we want to introduce even more uncertainty into a network that the mass media already demonizes as "too volatile".
Come on folks, please see this for what it is.  BIP100 is not good for bitcoin.  Use BIP101 or compromise on a lighter version of it, but don't introduce human vote / decision making into what has been up until now a mathematically sealed system!

This report is well written but far from objective.  The average new PC has 8-16GB or RAM, not 3GB, and the average computer user who runs bitcoin full nodes is not a facebook visiting soccer mom, they skew towards the technical side of things and likely run gaming rigs or more robust hardware.  I would guess the average person who is into bitcoin has 8-16GB of RAM or more on their primary desktop machine.
BIP 100 is *not* "one of the more moderate approaches".  BIP 100 introduces new mechanics that are untested and could wreak all sort of havoc.
Let me list a few of these issues.  I would really appreciate if if someone could provide an intelligent rebuttal to each:
1) The maximum block size *could* double every 2.7 months, leading to growth at rates of 16x + every year.  The only ceiling on this would be the message size limit of 32MB.  
This is far faster than allowed by BIP101 and has the potential to truly put running a full client out of reach of all but professionals.
2) The "voting" mechanism that throws out the bottom 20% and top 20% is a bigger issue than the "21% attack" previously mentioned.  This mechanism creates another tragedy of the commons where there will be an economic incentive for miners to behave badly.
As the report clearly indicates, block propagation times and the risk of orphan blocks disproportionately affect miners with slower connections.  This is why miners in China preferred 8MB over 20MB for the initial increase.  
Mining is a for profit activity, and now we are handing the block size limit over to a vote between miners.  Miners with better connectivity with vote for larger blocks, and those who do not will vote for smaller blocks.  The economics of the situation are unknown, but if a majority of miners calculate that their ability to process 32MB blocks is sufficient that it's worth the risk of orphaned blocks, it is 100% in their best interests to vote the limit to 32MB as soon as they can.  
Conversely, if miners that cannot handle larger blocks form the majority, they will vote the other way, potentially shrinking the cap to levels that are problematic for actual users.
Here's where it gets ugly...
3) What happens when power shifts from a max blocksize mining majority to a smaller blocksize majority?  What about the opposite?  
I believe that changes, like one group developing faster ASICs or getting access to cheaper power will cause the block size limit to swing for reasons completely disconnected from the needs of the network.  
4) Miners do not have a history of behaving in the best interests of bitcoin long term.  They have a history of behaving in ways that will boost their short term profitability, even if it puts the entire network at extreme risk.
A great example is ghash.io.  Ghash.io was the most profitable pool, and people kept using ghash.io all the way up to not 51%, but 54%.  All because it was slightly more profitable to use as a pool vs. using an alternative. Everyone waited until the last possible moment to switch, and went over the line.  Why would we be so foolish to think that this won't happen with max_block_size?
5) How is the variability in the max_block_size, especially given 1, 2, 3, and 4 above, better than a mathematically predictable 8MB doubling every two years?  With BIP101, we can know the max block size.  We can know how many transactions the network will handle on black friday this year.  We know what the throughput will likely be far into the future.  Wouldn't I be more willing to invest in infrastructure around bitcoin, a major marketing campaign around the holidays, or similar if I knew that the network could handle X transactions, vs. having to predict the whims of miners?
6) Mining is already the most centralized component of bitcoin, and we've already had existential issues with ghash.io, why would we put more power and control into this component of the network?
So, can someone please address 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a rational, intelligent way that puts my mind at ease and explains how it is better than BIP101?
Otherwise, putting block limits in the hands of miners is not a good idea in my book.  I think it's important to be honest about how little we know, and voting is adding more variables into an already complex system, and for no real benefit that I can see.

So... to extend this full circle.  Calling technical analysis "BS" is a form of blasphemy.  
It's also fundamentally wrong, pun very much intended.

I'm running a full node right now on my laptop.  Network bandwidth grows 50% faster per year at the same cost, much slower than processing power and storage costs.  
40% was not an accident.  It's well below the growth rate of the bottleneck in this equation.

[MIT regularly profits from partnerships with publicly and privately traded institutions.](
For example, their [CSAIL program alone involves partnerships with Northrop Grumman Corporation, Nokia corporation, and others.](
Bitcoin in open source experiment in electronic cash and decentralized systems.  The reason that it trades at value is because the it is designed to operate without friction, despite politics.  
We are still living in a monetary dark age because of our inability to create appropriately dynamic and low-friction guidelines for financial systems.  This dark age is still here because we let human beings create static "rules" for money that never change, and all important decisions are subject to bias, corruption, and, well, human nature.
So having development funded by a privately endowed college that actively profits from both industrial and government partnerships is extremely troubling for those that understand and support bitcoin.  If there is the slightest hint of corruption, hello fork.
MIT probably has the best of intentions, but needs to do a MUCH better job in terms of transparency with the arrangements.  MIT must outline their role in this arrangement, including specifically how they will fully insulate this funding program so that administrators and staff at MIT are not able to influence core development.  
Look, even being on your campuses or near your faculty so that personal relationships are formed will likely be seen as an issue for bitcoin.  If MIT's policies were as solid as bitcoin's cryptography, blockchain, and mining network they would trade at a value.  Guess what?  They don't, and the entire bitcoin ecosystem should be shielded from them, as well as those that might fail to observe these guidelines.
This doesn't seem terribly well thought through to me.  You have more work to do.

HD wallet is a hierarchical deterministic wallet.  What happens is when you sign up our service sends you a small program.  You choose a wallet password while you sign up.  This program uses that wallet password to create a "master seed" locally.  The deterministic part is because private keys are not randomly generated after the master seed has been calculated (with a high entropy, of course).  You can print out this master seed/extended private key during signup.  This master seed is used to recreate a near infinite amount of child private key/address combinations.  This maintains your privacy.
So... as long as you hold on to the master seed or the extended master private key, you can generate all the keys your heart desires, and the private keys associated with each node will be the same every time you derive those nodes from the master key. 
The other trick?  If I turn out to be Bernie Madoff (a thief), it doesn't matter.  Our servers never saw your keys or master seed, even temporarily.
You can literally walk away from Novauri, never sign in again, take that seed code and restore it in another service or program, and BAM, there are your bitcoins that were with Novauri, and they are 100% under your control.
You will be able to download and freely inspect the code in this program when we launch, so it's publicly verifiable.  We also take excessive additional security measures, because, well, it's bitcoin.
Seriously, kick @ service.  Sign up please.

Virtual currency is the phrase regulators use, so that's how you communicate with them. 
Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash system that uses a proof of work consensus with integrated economic incentives that automatically regulate issuance of new currency while in the process preventing double spending.  I don't know of a one or two word phrase that summarizes Bitcoin.  Electronic cash is probably best, just because it was used first.
Virtual and digital currency are imprecise ways to describe Bitcoin because they include things with properties that are different than Bitcoin, but are more tangible for laypeople.  Kind of like in the early days of the Internet people sent "mail by computer".

It's not close to "all I have", but there's nothing to argue about.  The video is completely accurate in terms of how the monetary system works.  It characterizes and politicizes it in an overly negative way, and that's a little disturbing, but there's nothing to argue about in terms of the mechanics.  The question he posed was to help people understand the underlying truth that you can't pay off the debt, because the system requires more debt than currency to exist.  My point about not understanding the video holds.

Thought?  Of course.  The payoff would be immense.  
Tried?  Absolutely!
Succeeded?  Well... not so much.  
I am not one to pump the value of Bitcoin, or say that it is unbelievably undervalued, but I will say this...
The average lifespan of fiat currency is 27 years.  Bitcoin is 6.  Fiat is inflated and devalued.  Bitcoin is doing exactly what it is programmed to do every 2016 and 210,000 blocks.
If this trend continues for another 10 years... how "volatile" will it be by comparison?
PS you can't separate the currency from the ledger (block chain) from the mining; it's a feedback loop.  I just like to say that in threads like these to reach the intended audience.

[Sign up for Novauri's closed beta](  Novauri is a US Bitcoin purchase and sale service that is going to beta very soon.  We don't have access to our customers' private keys, and we don't pool our customers' Bitcoin.  We even let you send Bitcoin you buy directly to any address you register, like a cold storage address or hardware wallet.
The key is that the service must never see or store your private keys, master seed, or data that can decrypt or create this information.  This removes the risk if a service is "hacked" (or an insider steals and blames it on hackers).  
Disclosure: I'm Will from Novauri.  We are building a remittance service too, although that service is no where close to as far along and still some time away.  More to come and check it out!

What makes you think loans can't happen without fractional reserve lending?   You can lend hard currency just as easily as fiat.  There is no need to pay a tax to create money to lend.  People with wealth in the form of hard currency can lend this out too.
The system is a stealth tax that runs on an inflationary model.  I don't necessarily disagree with taxation or wealth redistribution.  I feel it's necessary to stop the divide between rich and poor from becoming large enough to collapse society, but let's call it what it is.  A well hidden wealth redistribution mechanism.

For $2 to exist, it must be borrowed from the Fed.  This is how currency is created.  The trick is, interest is owed against that $2 (6%, if we look just at the Fed, Treasury, and Government and forget normal lending, which compounds the issue).  
It's never possible to pay back the $2 entirely, because one must borrow more money to pay back the $2 - bringing more money into existence which accrues more debt as interest.  This process devalues all currency by creating more and more, which is also called inflation.

Yes, standard KYC stuff.  There is no regulation requiring "selfies".  Companies do that to prevent payment fraud.  I find that practice really distasteful, but I can see how it would lower fraud.  Debits and credits from US bank accounts via ACH.  We will have instant account verification for most major banks, and if not, you will have to verify two small deposit amounts.  No credit cards.  The cash advance fees and instant interest on "pseudo cash" products is not predictable as it's driven by your bank, not ours.  We view this as a form of payment that results in hidden charges we cannot disclose consistently and transparently, so we won't allow that form of payment for our service.  Debit is probably not ready for launch, but possible.

I have a hangup on the term "virtual" probably because of my age.  15-20+ years ago people assumed that when they heard a salesperson say "virtually" it meant they they wanted you to believe a product had a certain property, but it didn't, and the degree to which it didn't was intentionally being hidden.  The term became so overused in sketchy late night infomercial television marketing that people stopped using it.  It was a red flag that someone was trying to lie to you and separate you from your money.  Not a good word to associate with a system that acts as a store of value!
The term isn't so negative these days, so it's not a big deal.  It's not too far off.
P2P currency, digital or electronic cash system, cryptocurrency, these all at least hint at and might make people think that there are other properties that might be under the surface making it work.  99%+ of people won't ever fully get the idea of consensus through proof of work until it's taught in schools while people are young, but these terms at least hint that there's more beneath the surface.  That's why I prefer them.

Novauri is a brokerage and it doesn't support any Country right now.  We start in the US early this year with a closed beta.  We do have expansion plans on the send, er... brokerage side, and Canada is an easy move to make. 
I posted here because Novauri is designed to never had access to the private keys of any of our customers' deposits.  That means someone can't steal, socially engineer and steal, or hack our cold or hot wallets, because we don't have cold or hot wallets with customers' funds.

Nice try.  Our developers can't commit code directly to production and we follow formal testing and release procedures.  And even if they managed to sneak in malicious and signed code somehow, it would impact maybe 2 customers before reddit and twitter blew up.  
The key here is that your hypothetical malicious coin-stealing wallet code has to be downloaded when a user logs in and wouldn't capture the private keys until the user entered the wallet password.  That password is only required to send or sell.  
So unless every customer logs in all at once and sent bitcoin all at the same time (about as likely as winning the lottery 100 times in a row), it would never cause a catastrophic failure we could not repay.  Even if someone pulled off this ridiculously difficult fraud in our company, it would only get them a few customers' bitcoin.  Why the hell would that evil criminal mastermind developer work for Novauri, when they can go work at a competitor and steal 100% of the bitcoin for as much trouble?

Yes, it is a web service with multiple layers of security including mandatory 2FA, a local client security component, and other risk services.  
I am not meaning to start an argument, but I do not like using words like "trusty".  I think you will agree that any complex security system with externalities has risks, and all security systems have externalities.  Either quantify the risks, expose new risks and quantify them, or you aren't making a case and are in effect spreading FUD.
I have quantified the risks you describe, they affect any web service, and I feel we've done a good job mitigating them better than others.


Doesn't give you much confidence in my company, huh?  Now I'm pretty sure you are a troll working for a competitor, or trying to pick a fight.
Answer this, FUDster person, how would that be possible to happen for any period of time when:  
1) We will be inspecting the files and traffic as an audit process on a regular basis, including after every release when a developer would introduce this issue for deployment, specifically looking for changes to this code?
2) Power users WILL inspect their local code and traffic (you can verify that a mysterious evil Novauri developer hasn't implanted malicious code for you to download by inspecting the file and looking at the traffic it sends)?, 
3) The risk vs. reward doesn't add up?  What you describe would require the same amount of internal collusion as stealing the entire cold wallet balance of a competitor.  
So again I ask, why go through all of that trouble to introduce malicious code past a QA team, code review, and deployment team in order to do one-sie two-sie theft that would quickly be uncovered when you could collude with multiple insiders somewhere else and get cold wallet private keys and make off with hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin instantly?  


Claiming 50%?  When did I claim 50%?  The largest player in the US brokerage industry insures 3% based on carefully reading their online materials.  Just their online wallets - 3%.  Now, keep in mind that they actually take CUSTODY of most funds and SHOULD insure everything to be on the same standards as USD deposits with FDIC insurance, but don't.  Others don't seem to insure anything at all or have "mysterious" insurance policies.    
At Novauri we are NOT taking custody.  Short of your mission impossible developer hacks that steal private keys as people send or sell bitcoin only (only practical if you have an amateur, immature IT organization and policies, which we do not) , there's no conceivable way for our systems to control your wallet.  
Bottom line, we're not insuring 3%, we're building a fundamentally safer system that doesn't require insurance because we aren't addressing the symptoms, **we are curing the disease.**
If you really don't like our wallet for some reason, then add an address from your hardware or paper wallet.    You can still buy and have the bitcoin sent to your own address and bring your own security.  We don't mind and encourage this behavior.  I believe it's in our FAQ.
I don't recommend storing massive quantities of bitcoin on any web wallet, although I do feel ours is much better than many alternatives when you consider how most bitcoin has been stolen.  
If you have very large balances, use offline storage.  That's the best way to go.

I bet that's what you tell all the girls.  No, no I am not new around here.  Lol.
I've used bitcoin all the time since late 2010 and make it a point to use every wallet out there.  I mainly use QT and cold storage, always keep an offsite backup, and was mindful of the 100 address issue with QT.  I have never had a problem with QT, er, core.  I use blockchain.info and electrum as my SPV and web wallets. Never lost a single bit of bitcoin.
That doesn't change the fact that I'm not a representative sample and the same applies to you.
My opinion is based on reading the posts in this subreddit over the years about lost coins.  A lot of them were bs, and sometimes they even give themselves away by saying things like "and the coins weren't mine".  
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:09:17


Lots of things are irresistible for some people, including counterfeiting.  That doesn't mean it should be acceptable or the people who do such things shouldn't be thrown in jail.
Something being "irresistible" is not a justification for letting it happen.  The question is, does the practice of "leveraging" loans to deposits (which is counterfeiting for you and me) serve an economic purpose, or does it just create bank runs and economic uncertainty?
This is the greater question, and is at the heart of the debate between Keynesian and Austrian school economists.  I tend to think that we might all be better off without the crazy shadow market voodoo math debt currency systems and with a simpler, more transparent system.  
That said, I think a hard currency system is also unacceptable.  Wealth concentrates, and if it becomes too concentrated, this ends in popular revolt.  It's a process that repeats over and over throughout history.
It's a complicated situation, and I don't think any one person or ideology has really cracked the code.  I think it's clear that cryptocurrency offers a far more efficient and frictionless way of implementing a currency system, and that the current fractional reserve systems are out of date and no longer facilitate an ideal environment for 21st century trade and economics.

That's not how it works.  If we "kept your payment" you can reverse the charge.  The risk is ours, because you can receive the bitcoin, reverse the payment, and we are left with the negative balance.  
What you are describing is not a risk for customers, it's a risk for Novauri.  We have to manage risk carefully including who we accept as customers when accepting reversible forms of payment.  It's an unfortunate part of the business model.
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:51:44
I have no proof, but I would not hesitate to bet that most "lost" coins are:
1) suddenly "missing" from a divorce settlement 
2) owned by someone else other than the "victim" (who is really a thief)
3) some paranoid type trying to create plausible deniability that he/she had lost control of a wallet to a) evade taxation, b) deny buying something bad or c) deny paying for a service they are ashamed of.
TLDR: most "lost" or "hacked" coins are not lost or hacked, unless you were foolish enough to store them in a place where a 3rd party controls your keys...

I don't have an issue with Coinbase's terms.  I think there's a problem with some seriously outdated regulation that errs on the side of economic friction and privacy violation for minimal gains in security and control.  That's not a dig, it was mostly written in the 70's, so all things considered, that's amazingly progressive regulation.   But... it's 2015.
[We do our best to keep our terms clear too.](
[We also write out a summary on regulation to go with it.](
Our philosophy is we might as well be transparent about what we need to do.   I do wish others shared our philosophy and took a hard line about disclosure.  
What is that cliche?   Sunlight is the best disinfectant.  I don't think there is a person working as a regulator or in the financial services space who doesn't agree that we need to overhaul regulation.  The problem is, how the heck do you change something that has legs and institutions hanging off of it?  It's not easy.

Correct, this release of our US brokerage does not compete with exchange services.
That said, I think there are some similarities.  Early brokerages were designed like bank services, and early exchanges were built like stock exchanges.
Novauri's brokerage isn't designed like a bank.  It's more of a semi-decentralized network with Novauri as the central hub and counter-party that also serves as the exchange point from fiat to bitcoin.
I believe a properly designed bitcoin exchange can operate on blockchain too.  The design of a stock exchange works well for traditional stocks, but I think there are approaches that fit a bitcoin exchange much better than the designs we have today.

I am not sure I would put merchants at the top of the list for blame.  
The credit networks were designed in 1958, and innovation in the space has been completely hamstrung by a vicious circle of outdated regulation, and companies enjoying barriers to entry caused by the outdated regulation.
I guess if I had to point fingers, I would point to popular political systems as completely ineffective in unwinding institutionalized stupidity.  In this case, the institutionalized stupidity is our banking and credit network systems, with designs that predate the internet.

I didn't say zero counterparty risk.  Most of the counterparty risk is us trusting that your payment won't be reversed.  That is a cost of doing business when you have to use crappy fiat payment systems that allow chargebacks and reversals.   
Still, it beats the counterparty risk of being mugged if you meet someone in person, right?
What we do have is zero custodial risk, because we never see the private keys used to sell and transfer bitcoin.  Because we never see the private keys (ever, not as an optional feature), it means we have no cold and hot wallets to steal.  That makes us systemically gox-proof.  We have no pooled addresses filled with our customers' bitcoin to hack, unlike every other bitcoin broker out there, including the big ones.
We also let our users buy bitcoin and have it sent directly to any address they register, such as a hardware or paper wallet.

I completely support this as a NOT for profit set of community best practices that are maintained by the bitcoin community as an iterative standard over time.
I will NOT support a for-profit boondoggle security consulting industry that's profit motive is in no way based on the elimination of fraud.  I will also NEVER support an attempt by a private company to create a defacto monopoly around bitcoin security standards, again, because the profit motive is entirely disconnected from the elimination of fraud.
The last thing we need are a few good ideas mixed with a bunch of outdated, massively long checklists and baked into an overpriced, for-profit certification process and gargantuan barrier to entry for new companies.  I'm not going to name names, but you can guess what I'm talking about.

@_date: 2015-02-26 00:04:50
Holding me to an incorrect interpretation of my words is not the same thing as holding me to my words.  I made no "indirect statement".  
Here's a good double metaphor for some sorely needed rhetorical effect.  
Think of Novauri is a currency exchange service at a counter in the airport.  When you buy and sell with Novauri (the currency exchange counter), you pay one currency, the agent exchanges it for another at a conversion rate, and they load it to a bank card from your personal bank account and then you walk away.
Think of our competitors are banks with a big vaults.  When you go to a competitor (a bank), they decide to let you in the building, you hand them some cash, they exchange it for the other currency, but they stick the other currency right back in the vault for "safe keeping".  They give YOU a bank card that has a representation of the money in the vault that you just exchanged so you can access and use it.
The risk with Novauri is that the agent at the counter specifically steals money out of your bank account because he or she somehow managed to write down your card number and other credentials without anyone noticing.  If they did this for a while to enough customers with no one noticing, they might be able to get away with a few peoples' funds.  
The risk with a competitor is that the owner of the bank is a crook and steals EVERYONE's money all at once from the vault.
With Novauri, you risk someone compromising customer accounts one by one over time until someone notices.  With competitors, you risk someone stealing everyones' money all at once, which instantly ruins everyone involved.
The currency exchange counter doesn't have access to everyones' money, it can only steal credentials if no one notices.  The bank holds everything, and is a much more lucrative target.
The thing is, the bank vs. counter makes the bank seem safer falsely.  In reality, the counter and bank scams are equally difficult to pull off.  The difficulty of perpetrating each heist is the same.
If we get hacked it will likely be a minor event because someone on our team or out in the community will catch the counter agent writing down the card numbers, because we have a camera on the person and are watching.  If they get hacked, it's Mt. Gox.  Kaboom.  Game over.
Is any of this helping?
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:31:35
Nope.  FinCEN looks at the exchange of fiat and crypto as the trigger, holding or sending bitcoin isn't money transmission.  Companies are interpreting things very differently, but the guidance is clear.
New York is about to cross over and do this with their bit license, though.  They will be the first regional power to attempt regulation of a transnational protocol.  This will likely be more of a "gotcha if we need to" type of affair as enforcement will be problematic for businesses who don't derive much revenue from NY State.
I agree we need to grow the size limit and encourage on blockchain services.  Of course, I'm not exactly a neutral bystander on this subject...

Interesting idea.  You are going to have some serious obsolescence problems with Raspberry PI though.  Full nodes take some power and you'll need storage space.  You need one that is an SPV client and another "cadillac" version that runs a full node.
Tor might not be the greatest idea.  You would need lots of connections, and that might clog things up.  
I love the idea of obfuscating the IP address to protect the user from thieves and muggers.  Might want to look at an update to the reference client?  The balance is between privacy and anonymity though.  Hardware dark wallet would draw some serious heat, and it's understandable why that is.  Popular with cryptoanarchists, but that might be a tough sell as a mainstream device or component.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:56:58
40% is pretty safe, but this has absolutely nothing to do with why this is happening.
The regulations apply to the exchange of fiat for crypto currency.  When you as a customer buy or sell bitcoin for fiat, this is the trigger for these regulations applying to you as a customer.  At least that is how it is supposed to work.
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:29:09
When you "sell", you are actually sending bitcoin from one of the addresses derived from a master seed created locally when you registered.  We give you a price when you sell, and after sufficient confirmations, we credit your bank account.  That credit is looking like US ACH, which can take up to 2-3 business days to post.
There is no service that eliminates counter-party risk from a fiat to bitcoin exchange without an expensive 3rd party escrow service, and even then you have to trust the 3rd party too.  
We're the best design there is out there that doesn't involve an expensive escrow agent that introduces delays.

Merged mining sidechains don't threaten bitcoin, but carry reduced security with no benefits or upside.  Non merged mining sidechains are hazardous because they drain economic incentive from mining bitcoin to other mining schemes, and there is only so much money in the world to invest in mining hardware.

It's not an exchange, it's a brokerage.  You enter an amount to sell, we quote you a price based on the size of the order.  You "sell" when you send the bitcoin to our system wallet.  We then credit your bank account with the proceeds of the sale at the price quoted via ACH - assuming there are any banks left in the US that will act as an ODFI for a compliant Bitcoin service, that is.  We may hold onto the bitcoin you sold us or we may not, depending on our business rules.  That has no impact on you.

All it takes to steal from a cold wallet is a physical breach, an inside job, or someone socially engineering someone on the inside.
This is why no one has insured cold wallets.  It's also why ALL of these bank like, centralized services, including the big ones, are so dangerous, as in Mt. Gox dangerous, and why they keep dropping like flies.

What I am saying is that the malicious wallet code scenario will never happen in the first place.  
If it did happen, that would be the equivalent of someone stealing all bitcoin from a normal brokerage that uses hot and cold wallets.  The normal brokerage would notice this change, and we would notice the malicious wallet code being sent from our OWN servers.
Your entire argument is that we would intentionally, across three departments designed to keep each other honest, intentionally defraud our own customers and risk jail.
Assuming ALL of that happened (it won't), only then would we begin where you started.   
Then, every one of our customers would have to not only log in to their account, but SEND OR SELL bitcoin.  Logging in doesn't do it.  So you are saying that all of this would happen above, then no one would notice it externally even though it's super easy to detect, and that we should insure ourselves against ourselves because this could go on for years somehow unnoticed.   
You are basically screaming at the top of your lungs at a magnetic stripe reader hardware company for not keeping enough cash reserves to cover the balance of the checking accounts of everyone in the Country because their hardware could, hypothetically, steal numbers with no one noticing.  
Is it possible?  I'm not going to say yes, because you seem to have a habit of quoting things out of context in order to twist meanings, but let me just say that I'm sure a butterfly flapping its wings over the atlantic ocean can also cause a hurricane, but it's not something I lose sleep over or insure myself against.

We're going to have to agree to disagree on this one.  The good news is you can still be a customer without admitting defeat in this argument.

Didn't some group in Sweden fork it?  
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:02:47
But to be crystal clear... 
We are not promoting Novauri as a super secure wallet technology that you should use to store tens of millions of dollars in bitcoin.  
For big balances, my recommendation is to add an address for your cold storage or hardware wallet, and send bitcoin from your Novauri wallet to this address for storage.  
When you sign up,  you print out or write down the master seed to the wallet.  This means Novauri could disappear from the earth, and you could take this backup seed and recover all of your keys / keep your bitcoin.  You have custody, we do not.
What we are claiming, is that we are much safer systemically.  We deliver the encrypted data to you when you log in, and it's decrypted with a second "wallet" password that's only needed when you sign transactions (send, or sell).  
So we have no large hot or cold wallet balances.  You literally have custody of your bitcoin.  
So let's talk about fraud.
Outsider fraud: if someone hacked our systems and replaced the file we send that takes your wallet password and decrypts your stuff, that could be used to transmit the information to the hacker.  The thing is, we would detect that right away, because we regularly compare the signature of the file we receive from our own service to a known good copy.  That won't get by us for very long.  We would catch it.
Insider fraud or insider / outsider collusion fraud:  A rogue developer could also insert a malicious version of the code that decrypts your stuff locally.  To combat this, we don't let developers have production access.  This is standard for financial institutions, and required by various regulation.  It's a safety measure.  By separating duties, you prevent collusion.  QA and deployment are separate from development, and we check the signature after each deployment, making this impossible.  If everyone in our company conspired to commit fraud, that would be possible, but I'm telling you it's incredibly unlikely.  Look at the work history of my team on novauri.com/team.  We didn't just graduate from college.
Now, hypothetically, if we were all crooks, and I'm a really good huckster (I'm not), users would still catch the issue before it caught too many people. Users can also compare the signature of the file, inspect the code or network traffic too.  With this community, you can damn well bet they will too.
So it's onesie twosie theft at best, even with massive internal collusion to commit fraud.
Compare that to a bitcoin bank like service where it only takes 2 or 3 insiders to collude to steal everything (with multisig), or only 1 without it.  And if that happens, everyone with bitcoin in a pooled wallet is screwed.  That's most or all of the customers.
Which design is superior?  Ours!
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:08:17

Archiving this comment where 110101002 says he believes in Unicorns:


You need to read my statement very carefully.  The funny thing is, when you finally "get it", you'll understand that we actually are keeping 100% of customer bitcoin that we hold on reserve.  That's a total of 0 bitcoin.
We don't have control of the private keys that control the wallet used by customers, and therefore have no custody of customer owned bitcoin.  We also don't have access to the private keys that control any 3rd party addresses that a customer chooses to register to the account.  That's the point of the design, to not have to "trust" Novauri, and to know that every customer has this same security, so if we did have a security breach there are no cold or hot wallet balances to steal that contain bitcoin belonging to customers.
100% of nothing is... nothing.  Kind of like the amount of substance behind these sort of desperate attacks on our service.  I take that as a sign that we're about to be wildly successful.  Thank you for your unintentional support.

Note to people who haven't been around for a while, when you see Pollyanna articles or forum posts like these and posts about "paradigm shifts" mean that you are getting near a top, so brace for a correction.
WU moves principal intra-Country as well as internationally in a well regulated way and funds and/or pays out that money in cash.  It's a representation of international and domestic money movement, that is primarily performed by the underbanked, although they do have products aimed at other demographics and business services too.
Bitcoin is a currency that can be transmitted electronically, not a money transfer service.  That figure is mostly made up of investors who are betting on higher prices, and also double and triple counts as people move funds between their addresses.
So it's definitely apples to oranges.  No doubt about it.
And also, with Bitcoin, there are some serious bottlenecks.  The protocol can handle 7 trx/second presently, with a volume of around 1 trx/second right now.  Well from WU's 10k, they move around 230 million money transfers / year just in their C2C business segment, which is a little over 7 trx / second, already exceeding the throughput of bitcoin today.
So that needs to be addressed by the devs.  There's also an issue with fractions.  How many average joe six packs will accidentally send .0001 BTC instead of .00001 BTC.  With no chargeback option, it needs to be as plain as handing over a 100 vs 10 currency note to the average person.
Oh, and let's not forget the mining exploits and blockchain analysis.  And pressure for regulators to track everything.  Any one of these could cause a collapse.
So please chill out on the Pollyanna and paradigm shifts.  Rather than posting go read about how it works and get educated.

The trick isn't designing a modern and efficient form of taxation, unfortunately.  The challenge is twofold, first is throwing out the US tax code (and similar inefficient legacies of the past in other Countries).  Remember, there are entire industries built around these patchwork rules and people make this into their profession (tax lawyers, accountants, regulators).
Second is getting an efficient form of taxation written into law.  A simple progressive tax that graduates to a higher % for luxury items along with a very significant, loophole free estate tax would do the trick.  That plus a clear and heavily enforced set of regulatory penalties or bonuses for corporations to obey environmental and safety law is all we really need.  The progressive and death tax component could be automatedand be a black box to human beings.  Maybe the accountants could audit the computer to keep them gainfully employed until retirement.  The regulatory thing would have to be far more transparent, accountable, and not made up of lawyers, but academics in the respective field.  Eventually it would make sense to have AI centrally manage our economies, but that's a bit farther off and post bit-coin.
It should be very hard for local, state or federal politicians to enact new forms of taxation, and there should be a constitutional amendment requiring such changes to be automated.  Part of the problem is that it's too easy for well meaning but completely unqualified politicians to complicate the system, and too hard to parse and simplify it after the fact.

We need to archive older transactions out of the block chain and find new ways to keep the trx / unit down so we can keep the heavy clients alive and well.  And this needs to happen pretty damn fast too.  It's risky.  Don't want to screw that up...

The 500 &gt; 900 &gt; 600 spike/crash wasn't long money.  It was the group that was already playing the arbitrage game between exchanges trading on momentum created from the bullish sentiments by US officials.  It looks like on net 25% of the new money stayed long for at least a day.  
If this thing pierces 500 on the downside I would consider that an actual correction.  This was arbitrage and an engineered price bubble on news.  I wouldn't even dignify it by calling it a correction.

Internet bandwidth has grown 50% every year from 1983 to 2013, so it's about 10% less growth than Moore's law.  It's been remarkably steady and predictable.
Storage capacity has been 100% growth every 1.5 years since before most of us were born.
50% every year is still exponential, just not as steep.  The population of the world and the number of transactions isn't going to grow exponentially or we bump into malthusian catastrophes with starvation.
So eventually hardware catches up, but we don't have the infrastructure right now to support the bitcoin protocol as a global currency in its current implementation, and there are risks with increasing centralization and thin clients.
15 years might as well be 1000 years from now.  For all I know in 5 years AI will be replacing the BIS and central banks.  Who knows?
To repeat, what I do know is that there's a bottleneck if we want BTC to grow in its current implementation.  There's no denying this.

Nope, it's you.  Pencils?  When wealth is not redistributed, it accumulates at the top of the pyramid, especially if 100% of wealth carries over to their kids when a father and mother pass away.  Demand becomes skewed such that a shrinking few create a disproportionate amount of demand from the available supply of productive capacity.
Your silly little pencil feel good video?  Well, if .5% of the population owns 95% of the wealth, the demand for pencils will be much lower than it needs to be if we want to make sure our students have a way to write when they go to school.  If only only a tiny number of people can afford them, and demand for extremely expensive items like super mansions and ferraris will be greatly exaggerated.  Nevermind that we won't have schools because only the super rich will have the ability to pay for teachers for their kids.
So the productive capacity of humanity is distributed to serve the rich few, creating distortions in our ability to realize economies of scale and produce basic goods and services efficiently enough to support most people having a first world existence.
The whole thing spirals out of control without a fair but constant way to send money from the top back to the bottom.  
You do realize that the primary function of government and our central banking system is to redistribute wealth, right?  You realize inflation is a nearly invisible form of taxation that encourages reinvestment of capital because of its constant depreciation, right?
Bitcoins are naturally deflationary, which isn't a big deal as long as it's slow and steady (people don't spend if their savings is skyrocketing in value), but without a means to redistribute wealth evenly, it can't work  as a long term primary form of currency.  Not without some other mechanism to balance the supply of wealth evenly so all members of society can participate optimally in the supply chain of everything we need to consume and thrive.
So no, I'm not the one who has oversimplified things.  Quite the opposite.

Dude.  Not OK.  It needs to be decentralized or it will be compromised by powerful interests with lots of money...  Come on, that's not even something we should entertain.

Facebook may be about to learn an expensive lesson that already cost Google a few fortunes.  It's really complicated to move money around safely and securely.  Google wallet what?  Abysmal failure.  They can't do it competitively.  No way.
The beauty of bitcoin is there's no counter party risk, and the system doesn't require trust between parties, VPN, encryption or anything else beyond the protocol that handles all of these risks by design.  No need for fraud monitoring, or risk management.  The system is entirely self-sealed and secure.  It's a thing of beauty compared to the existing technologies.
Facebook would be wise to integrate bitcoin, because there's NO FREAKING WAY they are going to be able to create their own virtual currency that will have any form of support from the community.  Facebook can't be trusted with something that important given their sleezy history of how they handled customers' information.  I don't think we should let them ID stamp most of the block chain either.  
Better idea?  Delete facebook, use diaspora.  Let diaspora use bitcoin for p2p social money transfer.  That I can get behind.

The smartest hackers in the world try to hit money movement systems because it's where the payday is the biggest.

That's not the way it works.  China runs a surplus, the US runs a deficit.  
If the US defaults, they are still holding the manufacturing base and will continue to run a surplus.  The Chinese will choose to invest that trade surplus in other vehicles.
If the US defaults, that means that the value of those treasuries will plummet, which means interest rates for loans denominated in USD will have to skyrocket to offset the decline in value.
This will cause the price of all assets denominated in USD to skyrocket.  This is called "hyperinflation".  It's not good for the US.
Yes, China would lose much of the value of their assets held as treasuries, but the US would lose their status as holder of the world's reserve currency.
It would never unfold in such a black and white scenario as there are too many shared interests, but make no mistake, the US has far more to lose.

I'm bullish on Bitcoin as well, and I would love to see the currency take off and gain mainstream acceptance, but posts like these make me a little uneasy.  
Never allocate more than 5% of your savings as an initial investment into any specific asset that isn't a roof over your head or your means of transportation for holding a job.  Diversification applies to everything including Bitcoin.  Not following a balanced and diversified approach to savings is called gambling.  
Please don't encourage people to gamble.  No one can predict the future.  Ask Time Warner about their AOL acquisition, or look at dot com prices in 1999 vs 2001.  Florida real estate in 2007 vs 2008.  Tulip prices...

Um, why can't we simply use mdot sites?  I don't want to have a bitcoin wallet installed on my iPhone.  I would prefer to use a 
web wallet with a small balance for day to day purchases.  
Besides, smart phones aren't secure.  They aren't even close to something you could begin to call secure.  Not only do the telecom companies have no (read: zero) respect for your privacy as a customer, the phones themselves have more backdoors in them than the Winchester Mystery House.  Remember "Carrier IQ"?  That's just what we know about.  No thanks.
Oh, and I've been an iPhone user since the first model, but I am going to switch with my next purchase.  IOS7 introduced more annoyance than functionality.  That stupid pull up menu that should have stayed in the options menu that covers up the screen and the banner alerts that cover up the URL bar or next unread email to name a few. The hostility to bitcoin is the straw that broke the camel's back, not that I care about an mobile app.  I don't want to give my money to a company that actively stifles innovation, that's the sign of a dinosaur.  So Apple is dead.  Maybe it's time to short their stock?

Friendly warning, if this joke doesn't make sense to you:


You need to be really careful with security.  Don't keep a lot of bitcoins on a website, and always use google authenticator, authy, or a "second factor" to log in besides your password.
Bitcoins are not regulated, and if someone guesses your username and password, or if someone who works at these companies gets fired and does something illegal, you are 100% screwed.
Locally you need to watch out for keyloggers and malware, or even neighbors, friends, or friends of friends.  Highly recommend installing bitcoin-qt but moving the data directory found at "%appdata%/bitcoin" to a USB stick.  The USB stick should have the entire drive encrypted using "Truecrypt" or a secure encryption program using a passphrase using a string of words selected by randomly opening pages of a dictionary and pointing without looking (don't change the words or make up words in your head, there will be a pattern and the vocabulary in your head is likely not complete and definitely not random) separated by special characters.
Read up on all of this before you invest a lot of money.  It really can be a little risky if you aren't a total nerd.  Ubuntu or Linux Mint are also good OS's for the laptop you use for banking with bitcoin, but they are harder to use than windows or mac.  You will end up using a command line with commands that are not DOS based.
Oh, and don't believe the hype or listen to these polyanna douchebags talking about "paradigm shifts" and "great moments in history".  They drank too much of their own koolaid.
Bitcoin is a disruptive P2P payment technology that is better than anything available right now, but it has serious issues as well.  1) block size is still capped at 1MB.  To scale to the size required to replace VISA and Mastercard during peak volume - which is required for "paradigm shifts" and "great moments in history" that these evangelist bubble heads talk about - the 1MB block size that handles 7 trx / second would need to handle 15,000 trx a second.  To include the unbanked and impoverished of the world and micro transactions, I would at least triple that number to 50,000 trx/second.
So you are talking about a block size 2,000 times larger to dis-intermediate the networks and 7,000 times larger to accommodate the worlds' population.
Well, that's 2 GB every ten minutes of 7 GB every 10 minutes for the bigger "paradigm shift".  That would happen 144 times a day, 1008 times a week, and 52416 times a year.  
Each year the block chain would grow between 100 and 366 terabytes at peak volumes.  That's a hell of a lot of storage, you can't afford to host that locally with today's technology.
Then there's the problem of these sketchy websites.  It's a jungle out there, don't drink the koolaid and do anything stupid like dump your life savings into BTC, or abandon dollars or euros just yet, chap.  Be careful.

Please help me understand how replacing fiat currency removes the need for an investment market to value publicly traded companies?  Why would wall street care?  You don't think shares of a company can be valued in different currencies?  Hell, wallstreet could remain in business if we replaced dollars with packages of ketchup.  All we need is an electronic receipt for ketchup deposits and an exchange so we can trade ketchup on margin or take out puts and calls on future values of companies denominated in ketchup.  Within a few years we would have ketchup default swaps and KINCEN to regulate everything.

Friendly warning... you need to have a money service business license in order to exchange a decentralized virtual currency for another currency.  Allowing customer 1 to deposit funds and transmitting bitcoins to customer 2 is exchanging a decentralized virtual currency for another currency.
FinCEN is going to shut you down without a MSB license.  
Read this carefully:
You'll need to be able to meet regulatory standards for anti-money laundering and compliance many places depending on where you allow yourself to do business.  The US alone has regulatory agencies in every state in addition to the federal level.
It's a huge barrier to entry and prevents competition in the financial industry.  But, it's still there and they will shut you down without the proper MSB licenses.
The only way you are going to stay in business is if you make a substantial investment to gain the proper licenses, or if you go black market and move your site to TOR in the dark net, and then you are risking jail time for money laundering and doing business without the proper MSB licenses and will likely be labeled a "terrorist" to boot.  And you will likely get caught, because there is a movement of real money into a bank account to facilitate one side of the transaction, even if the book side of the money movement is opaque.  You will go to jail.
Sorry, dude, but be careful.  This stuff isn't taken lightly by those in power.  Follow the MSB rules and give the regulators a call about how to set up a sustainable and legal business.  Doesn't look like you are quite there yet.
