I want crypto centralized bank account, if it can do offchain transfers it can be useful for paying in shops. It is ideal for small amount, 1000 usd and lower, long term it save onchain fees. I am not afraid about confiscation or lost, because everybody who have fiat in bank accound must trust his bank today

Because customers own and can spent btc to merchants who accept fiat
Kraken earn 0,26%, merchant save on visa/mc 2% fees, papal fees

risk of drop price btc, if aliexpress implement kraken,bitfinex API can have directly converted btc to their fiat bitfinex account and request payout to their bank account without risk 
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:22:40
Exchanges like kraken, bitfinex, bitstamp should create pay API for merchants, those merchants receive converted fiat at current market price to their kraken, bitstamp, bitfinex account
