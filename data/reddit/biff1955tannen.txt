He wants to catch any possible dip even if it’s catching it in portions.

So if GDAX is not supported in my state, is there any reason I couldn't just pick another state that is supported? Would my bitcoin be held in GDAX limbo for some reason?Excuse my ignorance.

Hey friend, I’m on my phone and don’t have that option. You sound like a joy to be around though

He has possession of the money but he owes it to you because you have rights to it. I can’t just not make my mortgage payments because the bank gave me money and now I have it and they don’t.  They have the rights to the money until I pay them back

I decided to post a headline about the topic of my post? Yea... that's usually how headlines work. You should try to not be so angry in life. Take a chill pill
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:10:49
Where are you guys getting that the money is not yours? It most definitely is yours. It’s in their balance sheet as a liability. Meaning they owe their customer money. Because it’s not their money. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:59
Assuming that you checked the history and they are in fact pending then your price was locked in like normal. This just happened to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:17:26
Anybody not seeing their purchases pending in coinbase? (yes I know coinbase). Purchased on my phone and got a "buy successful" screen but then it doesn't show as pending in my history. Also it did decrease my weekly limit
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:14:38
Don’t try it again. Your buy is pending. If you check the history in the desktop site you will see it pending. You’ll get an email confirmation in like half hour
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:30:34
I don't think you read correctly. He will invest in bitcoin after he maxes out his traditional retirement plans. He's not cashing them out, he's maxing them out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:55:38
This is what I have been doing. Only takes a few minutes to confirm the transfer to binance and then buying alt coins with eth is an instant

This makes me wish I had a kid so I could commission you to paint me one. I only have two dogs though

You sound pretty angry. It was a simple question from somebody that explicitly stated they are A) a bitcoin holder and B) new 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:34:21
Somebody mentioned it in the daily thread and then I googled it but only found a couple articles about the December fork...
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:19:59
The purchasing fees for me have usually been about 1%. When I transfer to a paper wallet though it's been about $15. I think if you plan on keeping it on coinbase you would be fine?
Edit: Also I think there is a way to transfer from Bitcoin to GDAX? without fees and then transfer from GDAX to a wallet for less than if you were to do it directly from coinbase

How is asking about a segwit2x fork spreading fud? I said that I hold bitcoin. I heard there is a fork 12/28/17 and was just curious about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:03:32
Actually is is your money. It’s on their balance sheet as a liability. 
I’m an auditor 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:16:11
Hopefully they weren’t large buys because they all went through. If you check the desktop version of the site you will see them pending in the history

I'm just imagining the spiderman pointing at spiderman meme right now with OP and people in the comments offering to "help" they're both scammers.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:37:48
lol that was pretty good 
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:14:57
OMG lightning network must have kicked in on that last confirmation. Only took about 5 minutes for the last confirmation
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:09:36
Good news guys. A little over an hour later and I have 1 confirmation. Only another hour to go!
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:09:43
Not really a whooosh moment
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:46:09
Still waiting. Idk how you guys deal with this shitcoin 
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:23:42
This reminds me of the highschool kids that start smoking pot and start buying literally anything with a pot leaf on it so that they can let everybody know exactly how cool they are because they smoke pot. When really NOBODY GIVES A SHIT and they just wish you would shut the fuck up about it and be normal
@_date: 2019-10-12 02:22:40
What is it with new people always calling it “the Bitcoin” or “bitcoins”?
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:15:48
Hey at least you can admit you’re genuinely pathetic ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:51:01
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Literally the only thing this has in common with Supras is the name. It's a BMW. Also that rear end looks like a 14 year old designed it.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:01:40
bitcoin is a shitcoin with no use other than buying other coins
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:25:58
Waiting for OP to conveniently post his address in this totally not fake post.
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:48:11
lmao this legit made me laugh
@_date: 2019-10-04 13:11:23
He's probably some 16 year old kid that needs to feel relevant and superior to others by regurgitating this highly unlikely scenario that he's seen other 16 year old kids spewing.
@_date: 2019-10-12 02:28:13
I imagine if bitcoin becomes widely adopted to the point that banks are transacting in it, you would open a wallet/account with a bank that is registered to you with kyc and you would submit your statements from those accounts to the bank just like you do now. But isn’t the whole point of bitcoin to circumvent banks? 
Not that I believe banks are going anywhere, but isn’t that what bitcoin maxis want? To do away with banks
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:10:19
Not that I'm worried about my ledger but I do think paper wallets are on par with them if not a little more secure. Assuming that setting up the wallet went absolutely perfectly. I don't trust myself completely with that aspect so I prefer the ledger.

Like I said it has to be done absolutely perfectly. Which would mean you're operating on a computer/printer that hasn't and won't be connected to the internet.
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:06:05
lmao people like you that actually believe fiat is going away are hilarious.

If we had all known that the high was 20k, why would we stop accumulating at 10k and then only sell 20-30%? Why wouldn't you buy until right before 20k and sell it all at 20k?

Am I the only person that would welcome a post-apocalyptic world? Most of the world would be dead. You could do literally whatever you want. Live like kings. Want a lambo? Go find one and its yours. Want a mansion? Go take your pick. What literally anything? Go get it and it's yours. No rules. Do whatever your heart desires. I'd rather that than working a 9-5 for the next 40 years.
