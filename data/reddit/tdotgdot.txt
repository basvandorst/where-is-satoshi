It's complicated. Not only is storage a concern, but so is network propagation. The larger the block size, the more incentive there is to participate in a large mining pool (which runs the risk of collusion). Mining pools can alert members of new blocks much faster than a block can naturally propagate through the network. 
With 1 or 2mb blocks, this propagation time is just over 10 seconds seconds. Which in terms of an average 10 minute mining round per block, isn't a huge disadvantage. But if we increase to, say 10mb, what does this do to propagation times? If it means that an average node takes a minute to see a new block, that provides a huge incentive to be part of the biggest mining pools in order to guarantee you almost instantly see any new blocks mined from that pool. 
Fast block times present a similar challenge, and blockchains like Ethereum have complicated reward systems to help reduce the mining pool incentive by rewarding miners for finding blocks even if they don't get used on the longest chain.
Anyways, back to the original question -- it's complicated. You can absolutely make a compelling argument that we need to increase the blocksize today. But you can also make a strong case that we shouldn't. I trend towards the "don't increase now" side, seeing it as a conservative approach that ensures the properties of the network that will provide the most base value stay intact. 
I fully acknowledge it's risky as well. We need to scale this year or people will jump ship for other coins. But on the other hand, if you want to see a $100k BTC, we need to never, ever show any weakened security, or signs of collusion to manipulate blocks. Big fish are watching and ready to store the wealth of their fund/bank/nation in Bitcoin.

It is -- in fact, it already is. Everything else is just noise. 
Governments are not going to care about LN channels or $100 transaction fees when they back full percentages of their reserves in BTC. 
These are consumer level features. And they are great, and I'm excited to use them, and they may lead to a great % of Bitcoin adoption. But in terms of global store of value, of sovereign nation's wealth reserves? 
Besides, altcoins are p2p payments and utility tokens. Very useful at the consumer level, but not a single one is even close to capture the global value that BTC is. Hodl and carry on, friend. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:20:47


Yep, this is exactly right. Bitcoin has no CEO, it's fully decentralized. As such, Bitcoin supporters are responsible for enforcing norms and standards with whatever social capital they have. 
I get the talk about whether this is a Coinbase or Bitcoin protocol problem. And that's an interesting topic, but it doesn't immediately solve anything. Tweets, emails, reddits posts, if the core Bitcoin community is upset at CB, they'll have to respond. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:02:08
That's always a risk, although like you said you can just send another transaction with a higher fee to prioritize the remediation transaction. 


So to this point, I still don't understand the concern. Fees are the mechanism that flags importance. If there was only one miner/mining pool, then yes they could absolutely collude with a LN hub to ignore remediation transactions from the Lightning Network.
However, luckily, we have a large amount of mining pools, and the timelock on counterparty contracts in the LN should be sufficiently high where smaller (non colluding, if that happens) pools should have plenty of time to mine a few blocks.
It's really no different than in the current Bitcoin blockchain mechanics. If a party owns a sufficiently large enough amount of hashpower, they can game the system to break network contracts. If the hashpower is spread sufficiently, there should be no concern.

batching transactions is orders of magnitude better
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:50:48


Eh, I'd say this is on Brian. He's the CEO, he dictates the direction for the company. I'm fully positive that CB's eng team could implement batching quickly. Many smaller, less well funded sites support batching. I'm sure the feature has come up a lot, and the Coinbase execs shoot it down because it's not going to drive new users like other features would.
Hopefully they will come to regret that decision and will either implement batching or lose customers because of it. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:21:23
well, you don't have to increment your nonce sequentially, so technically, who knows
but yes, pools operate quite differently than normal mining, so more than likely he'd have been hashing an entirely different payload (different coinbase transaction, different nonces, etc.)
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:15:56
For sure. It totally could happen that BTC is never the majority of the crypto market cap. 
Or... what I see as being exceedingly likely (in the long term) is that we'll have hundreds of very small value utility tokens, which are only useful for fast, specific transactions but hold very low investment value (energy, file storage, computing, etc), we have a handful of medium-value (few B's) payment tokens that are good for various use cases (fast, private, regions, retailers, etc) that do capture a good amount of value, but still have a relatively low total market cap just because they are payment tokens with high velocity (remember, the more an average asset on the network changes hands the less valuable it is -- that's "velocity").
And then lastly you have the store of value, global reserve currency in BTC. It can literally capture tens of trillions of dollars of value by replacing gold as a store of value, and becoming a global reserve currency for banks and nations. 
The blockchain will likely change the world and provide huge quality of life upgrades for people everywhere. But it might not capture as much monetary value as people think, outside of the store of value/global reserve use case, which Bitcoin is certainly in poll position to take.

You can always issue another Bitcoin transaction that double spends a previous unconfirmed transaction. It is just a matter of whether a wallet is able to support that UI. But you can absolutely send any TX you want. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:28:23


Probably. Some of Satoshi's last posts talked about concern over Bitcoin growing too fast before issues could be ironed out. 
But on the flip side, it's hard to have one before the other. There was lots of talk (and smoke) about scaling for a while, but only now that blocks are constantly full and we have a competing hard fork is new tech really getting deployed. 
We shall see. Either LN and some of these solutions work, and maybe we find out Bitcoin shot to the moon to fast, and it will fall back in flames. Really hard to say.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:33:48
why would they ever do that?
their incentive is to make fees as high as possible. increasing the minimum fee in the block is a signal to wallets to send high fees transactions. intentionally lowering the fees would reduce a big revenue stream

@_date: 2018-01-08 18:44:15
It just increases the potential for centralization. The decentralized network is what gives Bitcoin it's (best ever in human history) security. 
This is a topic open for debate, but at some point large blocks will make it more cost prohibitive to mine Bitcoin (and provide the de-facto security). 
For example -- 1GB blocks would mean a significantly smaller group of people can mine Bitcoin due to the storage concerns. A smaller group of miners means less security due to the possibility of collusion and 51% attacks. It also increases block propagation time across the network (bigger blocks take longer to transmit across nodes), which further increases the incentive to be part of a large mining pool (pools can notify members of new blocks much faster than it takes people outside of the pool to get a block propagated to them). We don't want to incentivize people to be part of large mining pools.
Now, would 2mb blocks (which btw, we actually have with Segwit) present this problem? Probably not. Would 4mb blocks, 8mb...? Anyways, you get it. I think the core devs and miners who have been prioritizing off-chain scaling understand this. We don't know the exact trade off line between blocksize and reduced security, but it's there somewhere. Given the interest by hugely wealthy entities (banks, nations, etc.) to invest in BTC, I think the case is being made to prioritize security (not touching the block size and more than Segwit already did) for now, while off-chain scaling is investigated. That's all.
At some point it will be required to increase the blocksize, not matter how much off-chain scaling we have. But deferring that at this particular point in time seems reasonable.

@_date: 2018-01-13 00:06:00
Exactly, but that's only once you have the BTC ; )
You're trying to go from the old, centralized system, to the new decentralized, censorship resistant system. not always easy...
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:33:41
it might have been, for a while. we weren't seeing consistently full blocks before early 2017. so before then, we were indeed sacrificing security for an unnecessarily large block size. 
also note - this is a huge function of USD pricing. even though we had mostly full blocks as of Jan 2017, average transaction fees didn't go over $1 until late April/early May 2017.
fees per block in BTC have only gone up 3x since that start of last year. meanwhile, the USD/BTC price has gone up almost 20x. these $30 transaction fees? that's a function of BTC demand reflected in dollars. in a closed, BTC-only system transaction fees have only gone up slightly.
anyways, this is all to say, again, it's complicated. 1mb might have been too big, now it's probably too small. what's the right number to change it to next? how far ahead should we try to target so that we have room to grow without sacrificing now? is this a scheduled fork every few months, should miners be able to "vote" to slightly change the size each block (like Monero and a few others do?). arguing about 1mb vs. 2mb. vs. 8mb is not interesting. what is interesting is discussing what changes should be prioritized and how we should structure the evolution of the system.

Not even sure that's true. Lee released Litecoin almost 2.5 years after Bitcoin Core was released. There have been many, many Bitcoin clones.


If they were open to being progressive testing ground for future Bitcoin tech, sure. What point are you even trying to make?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:14:00


I think that's the wrong question. The LN won't directly impact the way the Bitcoin blockchain functions. 
I think it's highly likely that a few large, well funded hubs will route the majority of LN transactions. But does that make it more centralized? I'm not sure. Each person with a LN channel always have a valid Bitcoin blockchain transaction in hand, so it's not like you need to ask the Coinbase hub to pay you out. And it's not like these hubs will have additional control over the network, they have no ability to influence on-chain politics (unlike miners, core devs, etc.). 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:30:49
I'm confused as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:29:13
This is actually great news. Those bots will provide huge liquidity in the market, and outside the first few initial arbitrage opportunities, they will be making tiny, tiny amounts on each transaction as the arbitrage away any pricing differences. It would be fantastic for all investors. 
FWIW, this is exactly what is happening in other more established markets. These trading bots provide a hugely valuable service and make tiny margins off of it. Efficient markets at play. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:21:00
This is kind of circular. 
1. You can't increase blocksize as your only scaling solution. You need something else (likely off-chain).
2. You can't only scale off-chain -- eventually you need to increase the block size (which, btw, is not controversial at all). 
So what do you do first? Tackle the hard problem or the easy one. In the mean time, what is the largest driver of value for the network -- what should be prioritized?
It's not hard to argue that Bitcoin's biggest value proposition is by being the most secure, global, decentralized store of value in the history of man. Focus on "secure" and "store of value". Payments are nice, and will come (they need to come, can't be ignored forever). But while we are figuring out payment scaling, it might be foolish to potentially degrade the network security. Banks and sovereign nations are looking to store real percentages of their wealth in Bitcoin. Let's not mess this up.
Lastly, and most controversially -- Satoshi's vision (as I interpret it) was to bring full transparency and censorship resistance to banking. In his whitepaper he mentions "peer to peer cash", but I'd argue that a global store of value that replaces sovereign currency as the global banking reserves is even more valuable to achieving full transparency.

No, it's just basically a "summary" of the fees included in the block. I don't think it will actually change anything.
What I don't understand is why this is valuable. Websites and Bitcoin nodes can already easily derive this data by inspecting the transaction set of a block. Why elevate information to the header that already exists elsewhere?

Well, having a relatively high volume Bitcoin clone is not nothing. He has been pushing for Segwit and LN in Bitcoin, and was testing both of those in Litecoin for quite a while now. 
Even if we agree that he hasn't actually innovated any of this tech, he has done a terrific job of understanding where Litecoin can be valuable (that is, as a Bitcoin sidekick) in the crypto ecosystem.

@_date: 2018-01-12 06:50:47

@_date: 2018-01-13 00:09:04
well, probably, but that won't matter as much
because once LN is here, normal day-to-day transactions won't even notice the blockchain clutter
also, not positive how Coinbase would implement LN transactions, unless they were a hub, I guess, and by controlling your funds they were able to have pre-existing channels already open? I'm not exactly sure what the architecture would be.

I think part of block validation would be checking that the "minimum fee" in the header matches the lowest transaction fee in the list of transactions. Miners couldn't just make the number up.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:23:59
hehehe. you'd think that would help, but it often leads to the most confusing and convoluted UX experiences

@_date: 2018-01-09 20:35:26
hm, I don't totally understand the game theory behind that one
does he think it will lower fees, because miners will be too afraid of locking themselves into a high fee bracket, and so they will take at least one low fee transaction per block?
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:36:08




I'd say in terms of bootstrapping Bitcoin, and maybe as well in terms of finalizing it's market, yes the usability to the average person was/is make or break. But right now we are talking about widespread adoption by investment funds, banks and nations. I think that they 1) don't care about UX or fees, and 2) will provide a hugely stable base value for BTC. 
Like I said, we can't ignore fees and day-to-day usability forever -- no one is arguing that. But I do think at this point in Bitcoin's lifecycle prioritizing the huge store of value use cases (or at least, scaling without disrupting those uses) might bring the most value to the product. 
Put it this way, if every investment fund, bank and nation puts 1% of their wealth into BTC, Bitcoin isn't going away, ever. If we scale to 1M tx/s but don't have store of value support from huge wealthy entities, it might not matter. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:26:42


For sure. But the intent is that you can open a channel with a small amount of money, and use that to send/receive many, many small payments over months or ever years. 
Opening/closing still requires an on-chain transaction, but if in between that you are able to settle tens or hundreds of transactions using the LN, then it's a huge net win.

Not entirely true! Watch "Abacus: Small Enough to Jail". It's a documentary about the only bank to face criminal changes after the mortgage crisis. But in reality, this only drives home your point. All the big banks got off without even a slap on the wrist. 


Me too. I think at first BTC wasn't considered a serious threat, then even as it grew it just wasn't understood well enough by "the man" for them to attack it. And now, I think legacy institutions are just trying to make a little cash off this whole thing.
But I agree, at some point if Bitcoin keeps growing and really threatens to weaken the banking industry (not positive it will, btw), there will be some serious attacks. The scary thing is that these companies have enough money and power to force legislative changes. So we could see things like crypto exchanges banned, etc. 
Honestly, I don't think that will happen. But it's something to watch for, certainly not impossible, and to your point should definitely be discussed.

Seems not insane, market cap of gold gets a similar figure (iirc, $300k). 
But here is the catch - if Bitcoin fullfills its promise of being *the* internet currency along with a globally accepted store of value, while still retaining the decentralized, immutable, censorship resistant properties we all know and love, and at the same time other coins fail to provide any serious value? then it's hard to imagine a price too low -- could be millions, easy.
At the same time, if Bitcoin falters, fails to scale in a timely matter, and has its value proposition eaten up by an assortment of other coins? We could be back below $1k very easy as well.
To value Bitcoin you have to first take a big leap and try to project what piece of the market it might capture, and what the probability is of Bitcoin capturing that market. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:06:32

I think the fee structure is up to the hub/node managing the contracts. If there are enough nodes, the market will dictate the fee structure -- so if it's useful to keep channels liquid, I could definitely see a sliding fee structure. Again, that going to be up to each node.
But, if it's really hard and expensive to be a hub/node (and it might be, you will likely need a lot of BTC that you can afford to have tied up for a long time), then we might not see these market economics work as well.

If I give you a car, you pay taxes on that car. If I say I have a car in my garage for you, but you never pick it up, you probably don't need to pay taxes. 
Common sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:35:05
This is correct. Everyone saying "absolutely no" is wrong. The IRS has not commented on this, but it is very likely that trading coins is a taxable event. 
Simplest example: you buy $500 of BTC on Gemini, then a couple days later x-fer to Bittrex and trade your BTC for ETH. In the time since you originally bought the BTC, it has increased in value by 10%. Therefore, when you make the BTC-&gt;ETH swap, you need to pay capital gains tax on the $50 profit in BTC you "realized" when making the trade. 
The easiest way to think about all this is to assume that every trade goes: coin-&gt;USD-&gt;coin. It doesn't, but that is how the IRS is going to want it reported. 
Also, in terms of hardforks, I think the entire value of the coin at time of fork is taxable. As someone noted, this means roughly $266 of tax liabilities from BCH for each BTC you owned pre-fork. That is, if you were able to receive the coins (you probably don't own taxes if your BTC was in Coinbase, since you haven't received the asset yet). And, of course, if you've sense traded your BCH into BTC, any increase in BCH value from fork to trade is also taxable.
Long story short, this shit is complicated, and tons of people are going to fuck it up. Note: in your spreadsheets, track **cost basis**. But give it your best effort, don't miss anything big. The IRS isn't trying to pick fights, they just want their money. If you get audited and forgot to pay taxes on small gains realized during a trade, it'll be fine. You'll just have to pay the IRS what you missed. But definitely, definitely try to get everything as correct as possible.

Yep, even the Lightning Network whitepaper admits that a (fairly sizeable) block increase is needed if the Bitcoin blockchain is ever to support a Visa-like transaction volume. 
You still need to fund and close channels, although infrequently, and enough users on the network opening/closing will still congest throughput. 
But that's fine. I think the right scaling solution is to develop an offchain solution first, and then scale the chain as necessary. It's never going to be possible to contain all of the worlds transactions on a single blockchain.

I'd say the correct way to identify this on your taxes is by paying taxes on the coins when you receive (or mine) them, and then paying taxes when he sells them.
He probably did not pay taxes when he received it, but being over 5 years ago he should be fine in the eyes of the IRS for that bit.

Ok, then let's use AppleTalk, OSI, XNS --  all got beat out by TCP/IP.
Sure, the Netscape, AOL, MySpace analogies are not perfect, but they drive home a point. It's not like TCP was the only internet protocol proposed, there were dozens, probably hundreds that are lost to the record books. 
I think by focusing on the slight technical differences in the analogies we are missing the main point - not everything that arrives first ends up winning. Bitcoin needs to keep iterating and improving, or it risks falling into the historical pit of "first but forgotten".

Those super high fees are probably from wallets over aggressively setting fees to get into the next block, but if you have a few hours or up to a day, I'd look at that 50 Sat/Byte range or below and feel good about it.

That's actually a really interesting thought. I never considered that there could technically be a tax implication from just moving your coins. 
As you stated, I think it's highly unlikely to ever be taxed that way, but it does open up an interesting discussion.
I've always assumed that it will be taxed whenever the gains are "realized". So in your plane ticket example, you'd be taxed on the gains of 0.1 BTC when you buy that 0.1 BTC plane ticket. Something like `((.1BTC * current BTC value - .1BTC * ($20/20)) * tax rate)`. 
But this leads to other problems. Namely, it's kind of complicated accounting, and most people will probably mess this up. Especially consider examples where you have 10BTC, but they were all bought at rates between $100 and $5000 each, as you spend the coins you get to decide which gains you are spending, and you also have to be careful to track that and accurately report the taxes. You probably want to spend the coins you bought for the highest amount first (to keep your realized gains low), but careful not to spend any coin that you've had for less than a year - that's taxed as income. It's going to get kind of complicated. You could imagine a wallet that can track these things using exchange information being super valuable. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:42:06
I think it will be classified as a capital gain when the asset is taken into possession. So, your fork, no one cares, never sets up a wallet, never tries to move or even view the crypto at the forked address. It's unlikely you need to pay taxes.
For example - what if Bill Gates decides to give everyone on the planet $10. If you never go to collect the money, no taxes. It's dicier in crypto land, but I think the same logic can apply.
On the other hand, we see the BCH fork, you set up a wallet, run the Ledger split util, that's taxable, even if you didn't send it to an exchange to trade. If you are aware of the BCH fork, but have never moved the assets, or set up a wallet, etc? Then you can probably skip paying taxes until sometime in the future when you do touch the asset.
It's a grey area. Use common sense. Dot your I's, cross your T's, it'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:23:58


then the IRS may already know, your friend may get a letter in the mail any day now
anyways, you can always amend previous years of taxes. pay taxes on the full winnings at the historical price of BTC in his 2016 taxes, then pay taxes on the appreciated of the remaining coins when he cashes out now.
the IRS doesn't really care about users of gambling sites, just the operators that are (potentially) operating outside of the law. the IRS will be just fine with an update to the previous year and a claim this year.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:20:22
In some ways, but note the wording (bolding is done by me)


So, the way I read it is that you would not have anything to worry about if the 2% of "hot" coins is stolen, but if anything were to happen to the 98% of coins they keep in cold storage, everyone is probably fucked.
Now, of course, keeping them offline makes it exceedingly less likely they'd get stolen, but you know, that's lots of money and they are people involved.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:50:32

@_date: 2017-12-07 22:28:21
Not sure this is a good example.
Obviously the IRS can trace cash leaving your bank accounts, but then as you noted it's difficult (or impossible) for them to see what you spent it on most of the time. 
In the case of BTC, it is all linkable. It's very easy to tell if you sent BTC somewhere from your public address. All the IRS has to do is track down the transactions you sent and say "who did you send this to?". In a lot of cases, they might even know who owns the recipient address.

Some and some. For example, if scaling isn't solved in a timely and efficient manner, there is a high probability Bitcoin will fall back to ~mid-100s of dollars and just be a fringe internet protocol. Or even worse, better technically designed blockchains will fully take BTC's market cap and Bitcoin will become fully irrelevant. 
Yes, $10,000 is amazing and without question is a reason to celebrate, take some profits and buy some expensive champagne. But there is no question it can all be taken away, quickly. 
It's like if you started a company, and it went from your parents garage to IPO'ing on the NYSE. You'd celebrate, but you certainly can't put your feet up and relax. Now people are watching. Now the real work starts.

I guess to be clear -- the one point where I disagree is that I think it is OK for the Bitcoin community to put up a big fuss until Coinbase supports Segwit. Sure, we could incentivize the network even more to upgrade to Segwit (like you said, by waiting until the LN is available), but we could also do what is within our power, and meme/tweet/reddit until Coinbase takes a hint.
I get the sentiment that Bitcoin was designed to be outside of politics. That's the protocol and it's amazing (honestly, this is an interesting topic, but the Bitcoin blockchain might be too good at not caring about outside forces -- for example, transaction fees in BTC/tx have only increase ~2.5x since last year -- it's only the dollar amount that has skyrocketed). But Bitcoin is where it is today because of HODL, and memes, and an insane cult that can't stop talking about how perfect Bitcoin is. That's the marketing team, that's why Bitcoin has the name brand. 
And it's not like Coinbase is strictly playing politic-free. They have their projects they want to succeed, they want features put into Bitcoin (or not put into Bitcoin) that can make them the most money. So like any company, we can vote with our dollars, and we can also voice frustration. Anyways, it's fascinating to watch. But personally, I like having this army of fanatics and crazies all around us to keep Bitcoin marching forward. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:15:45
ehhhh, I buy half of that, don't buy the other half
Segwit adoption by places like Coinbase would greatly decrease mempool clutter. The large, automated exchange payout transactions take up a lot of room on the blockchain, and decreasing their weight by making them Segwit transactions would go a long ways towards reducing network congestion and fees.
This not only helps random people like us, but should also decrease the fees Coinbase has to pay on these payout transactions, and increase the payout speed. I feel like Coinbase should be motivated right now to implement this because it immediately improves their customer's experience. I also feel like they are invested in the health of the Bitcoin blockchain, seeing as the majority of their business is selling assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:23:10
In theory, yes. But that relies on the node you have a channel with and those 99 other nodes being able to traverse the network graph. What I means is -- your node has to be able to ask the other nodes for their open channels, and potentially be able to traverse through a couple other nodes as well. That isn't exactly simple logic, and certainly isn't baked into any spec. It requires stitching together huge pieces of data (not totally unlike what Google does with Maps -- the difference being Google has all the data up front, in this case, you can only uncover a piece of data by asking another node).
So this makes me think that running an efficient node of going to require a lot of data IO, and be potentially computationally heavy (in addition to requiring a lot of tied up capital, aka. BTC). What makes it worth it for these nodes to supply these services? Lots of fees -- you'll have to pay each node you hop through. Now, of course it will be less than the current on-chain fees, but I'll be interested to see how the economics fall into place. One thing to keep in mind -- the less nodes we have, the lower the fees we likely see due to less hops and easier route traversal. But that obviously leads to a centralization issue. Anyways, will be very interesting to see how this all plays out. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:11:15
coo coo, that's fair
7% could also be pretty low, for example over the last 30 years the stock market has averaged almost an exactly 10% year over year return. if I was trying to plan my next 30 years, I might use 7%, but this guy probably averaged at least 10% return over the last 30 years.
anyways, that would be roughly $22k saved per year over the last 30 to get to $4mil. not the easiest, but probably pretty doable if he was in a decent tech job during that time.

Scaling is being addressed, but it's not a given it will work to provide the desired user experience. LN is complex, and is not actually useful until we have a huge network of channels with some very big, stable hubs. That's going to take time, and if it takes too long, or hits technical issues along the way, maybe people give up and move to other coins that have already figured out scaling. 
Look, I'm long on Bitcoin. I think it's both a hugely valuable investment vehicle, and a revolutionary technology. But I think any Bitcoin supporter would be foolish to not acknowledge that it is no where near being a sure thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:05:49

I think as long as you have your seed phrase it will always be recoverable. Sure, tech changes, OS's upgrade, computers lose USB drives, but as long as you have a known way to discover your private key (in this case through the seed phrase and wallet's algorithm), you will be safe from losing your coins. Even if a specific hardware wallet company went out of business, you'd still be able to track down their seed -&gt; key algorithm on the internet (because so many other people would be interested, as well) and easily recover your private key, leaving you free to move your coins wherever you want.
Personally, I use a paper wallet generated from  w/ BIP38 encryption. This means even if someone sees my wallet, they still need to know the passphrase to unencrypt. Using this technique you can be pretty secure storing the wallets in various places, because they are still unusable without a pw, so hiding them is less of an issue.

I like this technique. I use a slightly modified version, but roughly includes 1) paper wallet, 2) BIP encrypted private key, 3) encrypted PDF of wallet details. After step 2 I print off copies and hide it. After step 3 I put the files in places that are easy enough to access if I ever need it, feeling safe enough to use a cloud storage service, since my private key is effectively two layers of encryption away.

edit: I think my view on buying a house is that the actual house probably isn't a good investment (it likely won't appreciate in value anywhere close to other potential investments), but the ability to borrow money at an insanely low rate gives you the potential to earn money from cash you wouldn't normally have. Writing off interest payments is also big. But repairs and property tax takes a big bite out of earnings too. It's tough out there! My guts says only buy a house because you really want to live there for 15+ years, and then take advantage of these things. Otherwise you might be better of renting and being flexible and investing excess cash wherever you can find the best return.

Meh, I bring it up to people as "interesting" or a "curiosity". I'm not an evangelist in that I don't try to tell people how it is going to revolutionize currency. But whenever I bring it up as "look at this crazy cool tech that is worth ~$1k/BTC and has gone up X% since the fall" people are generally interested. Just a find a reason why someone should care - generally it's as simple as "these things are worth real money". Then they might ask questions, you answer them in your best "this is cool" mindset instead of a preachy mindset, and it'll get the gears turning. 
Edit: this year for xmas I gave small value paper wallets to a couple people I thought might be interested. Those turned out to be the best gifts I gave anyone (and some of the cheapest!). Present it as a fun novelty, teach them the history and the increase in value, teach them how to use their wallets, and then they can decide if it works for them or not.
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:02:15
Yes and no. Housing interest rates are currently 4%, while inflation is about 2%. So your really only "losing" money at an annual rate of about 2% if you take out a 30 year loan and factor in inflation. 
For example, say your mortgage payment is $1000 a month - in 2047 you will still be paying $1000 a month, but that will only be worth about $550 in 2017 dollars. 
Anyways, assuming you can invest in something with a better rate of return than the 4% you are borrowing money at, it actually makes financial sense to take out a home loan, even if you can pay cash. Now, if you do get a discount for a cash purchase (not positive how often that's true) it would change the equation a bit. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:30:29
No, very true. But it would be interesting if a reputable institution was able to create these notes and apply a fool-proof tamper device over the private key. Right now you can't really exchange the notes offline without worrying if the private key is real, or recorded elsewhere to sweep the account the moment after you give up some goods for the note. 
In theory that would make bitcoin transactions much simpler for the less technologically adept folks, or for people in places where you can't always pull out a smartphone and get services to send coins.

I really like the concept. In terms of the private key w/ the tamper evident sticker - is that meant to completely conceal the key? I couldn't quite tell from the specs, but that would seem to make sense. 
Also, isn't there a potential scam where someone creates/prints/applies the private key, but records it elsewhere? And then as soon as they use the note to barter for some good, they sweep the account? Or I guess you could even just apply a "fake" private key that doesn't work. It seems like there is a point where you need to jump from these paper notes to real electronic transfers to get the security of the system. 
I guess the actual exchange/transfer part is still tricky, but I could see myself using this as a nice way to organize my personal paper wallets. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:57:46
Not it's not. One of the biggest values of Coinbase - maybe their only value - is that is makes buying/managing Bitcoin easy for people. People who had BTC on Coinbase aren't just lazy people who didn't feel like transferring to their own wallets - they are people who can't because it's too complex. It's well outside their realm of comfort. 
If Coinbase is going to focus on ease of Bitcoin management as their core value proposition, they have to be realistic about the type of customers that attracts. Giving out a "warning" to move your coins is a nice thought, but wholly unrealistic for many of their users.

Buying Bitcoin is like trading Euros or Yen in any other exchange market. I get your point - don't put dollar bills under your mattress. But BTC is a solid (if not a bit risky, obviously) investment that many people are considering part of a well rounded portfolio. I think you could target 5-10% of your portfolio invested into BTC and be diversified enough to withstand a BTC crash, but invested enough to reap the rewards of a potential 10x spike in the future.
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:27:22

Couldn't they just follow the chain of transactions? Would they be able to see that you bought on Coinbase, then transferred to X address? Then from there wouldn't they be able to see all the transactions from X address to various other addresses? Probably way more work than is necessary to find the appreciation on BTC before you bought yourself a coffee, but would that be theoretically possible?
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:05:08
It's just diversification. It's always your own call (duh), but most investors prefer a diversified strategy. You could have been well diversified at $100/BTC, but now that we have reached $1000/BTC you portfolio might have way too much (more than you are willing to lose) in BTC. It could be entirely reasonable to sell a part of your bitcoin to readjust your allocations.

Housing appreciation has lagged well behind the average market return over most of US history. Roughly 5% a year on houses vs. 10% per year in the market. 
Your point isn't wrong, but you shouldn't be investing the majority of your annual income in housing and education. Education should be a large one time cost with perhaps small reoccurring costs for conferences, etc. Housing as well. Tools are one time costs than only get cheaper because of inflation, and have low re-sell value the moment you buy them. You should have a large portion of your income left over after your "tangible investments" to invest in higher return assets. Neglecting that is ignoring one of the most proven ways throughout US history to make money. Stocks, mutual funds and currencies (BTC!).

Do both! Encrypt your private key, and then encrypt your file before saving it somewhere online. 
Obvi you double the risk of forgetting the two passwords, but you can probably be safe making them both relatively similar so it's easier to remember. 
I'd always want to encrypt any private/personal doc I put into cloud storage, just so that if the NSA/Feds force Google/Dropbox/whoever to share the documents at least you have your most important documents encrypted. And then of course I'd always want to encrypt my private key so that if someone sees your paper wallet, they still can't gain access.
Edit: I'd avoid hardware wallets unless you really are going to want to spend some of the coins. Even then, I'd keep smaller amounts on them. I'm always wary of hardware malfunctioning or aging, companies going out of business, buggy software updates and/or getting so far out of date that an update is hard. You just can't beat a paper wallet with an encrypted password. Print it off and put it in safe places, and encrypt the wallet and store it somewhere secure online where you have 2 factor auth enabled.

I think it did. People were licking their chops after they saw all the "free" Bitcoin Cash people got. I expect people priced in at least a 10% additional value into BTC, assuming they'd get that extra value from the fork.
I was always expecting a bit of a pullback after the fork - people cashing out of their 2X and moving some of their extra pre-fork BTC into other alts.
Now, I think there has to be a similar, if not slightly more severe pullback. In the long run, it probably doesn't matter. In the short term, probably some panic sells from people realizing they won't be getting an extra free coin.

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:38:54
well, I guess we should disambiguate the term "Bitcoin" then
the protocol - blockchain - and the underlying token - Bitcoin - did not fight of an attack, acknowledge an attack, or do anything other than continue on with the rules they were programmed with
if you mean Bitcoin The Community, then ya, sure, we FUD'd and reddit'd our way out of the chance of seeing what would happen with a hardfork
although, in my opinion, that was always wasted effort. exchanges don't get to choose what Bitcoin is. they can stop supporting a certain coin, but in a free market, as we are, a competitor will always step in to support whatever coins they want, most likely driven by (implicit) popular vote
personally, the community tends to get just as rilled up in storylines and finger pointing as other subs. shit don't matter, if Bitcoin is as good as we all say it is, if it's meant to have staying power, forks will never matter
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:57:02
Ya, I'm not sure any exist. In general BTC pulls the crypto market up or down, and you aren't going to see something truly negatively correlated. 
But I do think you can find some for small periods of time. In particular, BTC and BCH were almost exactly negatively correlated for about week during that insane BCH pump and dump. If you wanted to short BCH, for example, shorting the BTC/BCH pair would have given you pretty outsized returns. I think you can find those open for small windows if you are really paying attention.
Otherwise, maybe you have to look outside of cryptos. Although, not entirely sure the crypto market is tied to any other market. From what I've heard, most big investers that are coming into cryptos are doing so because they are so uncorrelated to anything else. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:34:09
I'm not sure. I think there are so many other strong competitors now, that in many ways have technical advantages, that BTC dropping to $1 would probably spell doom. BTC leads and will likely continue to do so because of the strong network. Falling to single digits would likely lose most of that network. Now, $1 is probably lunacy, because that might mean the entire crypto market has collapsed, or something insane. 
But even falling to sub $1000 at this point could really give other alts the space to make a serious move. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:02:09
There is a fee for everything. 
So in the simplest sense, you pay a fee to the miners to move your coins from one address to another. You'd pay that fee if you moved it from one Ledger managed address to another, the Ledger to the exchange, an exchange to the Ledger, etc. etc.
Now, what some exchanges do is charge you a flat fee to withdraw. I know Bittrex does this, I assume other places do as well. When you're charged a flat fee, that is generally going to take care of the mining fees plus a little extra for the exchange to pocket. Some exchanges might even pay your fee, just because they already took a lot off the top when you bought BTC from them. You'd have to look. But there is never really anything as a "free" transfer - either you're paying the fees at the time of transfer, or you're using a service that has already taken enough money from you to pay the fees.
That said - small price to pay to keep your Bitcoin secure.

Similarly, hardly any high value company only has 21,000,000 shares. Google has almost 300 mil. Microsoft has almost 6 billion shares.
Anyways, I don't think many people look at the price and say, "hmm, $7000, that's a lot for a share of stock in a company, must be a bubble".
I think people do look at the ~600% growth in a year, or the ~75% growth in a month and say "that seems too fast, must be a bubble". 
Of course, most of us disagree with that. But it's not necessarily without warrant. Anyways, I think op's assumption that "bubble" talk is based only on the raw dollar amount is probably misguided. I'm pretty sure people of that opinion feel that way due to rapid high percentage growth.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:23:52


It didn't fight off an attack. That's not the point of Bitcoin. The point is that Bitcoin should never have to care about an attack. And honestly, calling a hard fork an "attack" is the wrong word. Really, it's a competitor. Bitcoin isn't a retaliating piece of software - on threat of a fork it does nothing, it continues on by the rules of the blockchain. Nothing more, nothing less. 
I think the term "fight off an attack" is actually extremely misleading.

Really? $100 in BTC when it was at $1 per coin (early 2011), would currently be worth $700,000+. It's negligible - a rounding error - whether you paid $100 for it or got it "free" through mining. 
To me that has no bearing on whether entering BTC early was a gamble or not.

3. I bet the people who could eloquently talk about the 18 month roadmap are not posting on Reddit very often

People here are describing this situation in hostile terms, as if there were heroes and villains.
There is but a software protocol. And it does not care. And it is happily shared to anyone in the world, to make any modifications.
In fact, some people - most, really - list those properties as among the best that Bitcoin and blockchain have to offer. 
Circling back - this sub has picked sides, and has decided to alter the fundamental properties of Bitcoin when talking about it to fit their narrative. We know better, we know that a fork is probably a *desired* outcome of Bitcoin. It's literally the game. But, through emotion, or FUD, or $$$ invested, we trick ourselves into pretending this is something else.
But it's nothing but Bitcoin.

I doubt there is any repercussions.
The sad thing for me is that there are people who lost and will lose substantial amounts of money from this outrageous pump and dump of BCH. Bitcoin Cash isn't a real idea, it's an (arguably smart) strategy by a small group of people to make a lot of money. IMHO, it's not substantially different from an ICO that rakes in money but never actually plans on delivering anything substantial. It's just packaged up differently, so it's hard to see on the surface. 
But dig a little deeper. Right off the heals of the 2x flop, we see 10x BCH volume from random exchanges, all of a sudden the BTC mempool is clogged, an influx of pro-BCH talk on this subreddit. It's not really that hard to see.
Anyways, point being - the people orchestrating this make big bucks. Good for them, fine, whatever. It sucks, though, that there is someone who might really think bigger blocks is a good idea (and really, maybe it is, but not executed like this) and invested some of their money in BCH only to be whipped around by people manipulating this market. And it will all be gone once BCH falls back down to $300.
That's what bums me out. There are people who are trying to make honest (albeit risky) investments in this stuff, who are just absolutely getting bulldozed by these ploys that are being executed to make some whales big dollars. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:23:17
My gut is that people are loading up in hopes of getting "free coins" from the 2x split. They saw that Bitcoin Cash retained a fairly significant value, and are hoping to cash in on that w/ this next fork. Particularly looking at the futures, you could stand to make a "free" 15%+ if neither BTC or B2X changes in price.
That said, imho it's highly unlikely B2X retains a price anywhere near the current futures price. And, similarly, I think we see a pullback in the BTC price once the "free coins" are no longer priced in. 
But that's all temporary. That's short term stuff. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:39:29
The only options I'd recommend are Ledger or Trezor. I got a Ledger myself and love it. When I was doing research it seemed to support a few more coins that I was interested in, and I liked the design of the apps and physical device a little more than the Trezor.
That said, I didn't really see anyone say a bad word about the Trezor, either. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:44:06
My impression - no one is attacking Bitcoin. This is all a well-time, transparent scheme to pump the price of a shit coin that has no roadmap and no development so a few whales can make big bucks. 
I sincerely doubt that the big BCH backers even want to take down BTC. They just want this huge temporary pump.

To me it breaks down into two groups - the people who fully understood the tech, the implications and believed in the future, and those who just put money into a cool thing. 
Does it matter? Probably not. But that's how I'd differentiate an "investment" or "informed guess" from a "gamble".
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:41:03
In which case? With a hardware wallet? The physical device is nothing but a convenience. I'd give you my Ledger right right now and not worry for a second about my coins. 
It's all about the recovery phrase (which can be used to generate your private keys). Of course that is no where near where anyone can access it. 
Besides, what's the other option... a paper wallet? Is that any different? Where do you keep the private key?
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:20:56


(I realize this isn't you - it's a quote from a couple spots above)
People talk about Bitcoin in a strange way. When facing adversity (fork, media criticism, price drop) we say "Bitcoin resisted...". As if the network fought back against something (as if it wasn't just code that runs a set of rules).
When things are going well, we expound on these egalitarian principles that guide Bitcoin and how the open source, clone-able, fork-able, code-ified properties are what make it great and allow anyone to participate however they so choose. 
Well, which is it? Did Bitcoin "resist" something, or did it just keep playing by essentially the same rules that it has been for the last ~9 years. Can *anyone* make *any* version they want and participate, or does "the Bitcoin" need to fight back and resist hostile attempts to XXX (fill in the blank).
You see what I'm getting at.

What makes it take so long? Would it be possible for the core devs to publish a known/publicly validated blockchain that new nodes could directly download? Obviously, local nodes would still want to verify the chain after that, but at least the downloading would be much quicker. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:28:46
It would be very, very easy (and relatively cheap) to wash a large amount of Bitcoins by first converting them into a privacy based altcoin. XMR-&gt;BTC-&gt;XMR would easily do the trick. Use an exchange service like Shapeshift that doesn't track identity.
As far as keeping the coins within the Bitcoin blockchain, I'm not sure that would be possible. You could make the trail very convoluted, but if someone was looking they could always track it down.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:47:11
Your mindset is correct, but your 50/50 valuation is incorrect. For example - if you really believe there was a 50% of Bitcoin Cash "winning", you'd be grabbing as many as you could, because as of a few days ago it was just 8% of Bitcoins price. Ergo, you would want ~13x the amount of Bitcoin Cash as BTC, if you really believed in a 50/50 split. 
What the honest answer is, is that the market is telling us what they predict the odds of success are. A few days ago, the market though BCH had an 8% chance. Now, closer to 15%. 
Also, Vegas was built on rigged games and taking cuts on bets. Choosing a crypto is nothing like that. There is no "house". 
The only reasonable thing you said is that it makes sense to diversify your portfolio (in so many words). So yes, it is smart to diversify your portfolio.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:41:51


I'm scared that this is "the big kids table" doing these things. It's not just finger pointing, this is market manipulation so that big BTC/BCH holders can make millions. And it's going to continue. And it's not confined to just one "side" (which, honestly I think big players don't really care about sides).
I know that post doesn't directly go into it, but this has to have been part of some play to either a) shift the markets before that huge BCH run up (meaning vote manipulation actually started earlier than reported), or b) redirect and distract us "casuals" after the huge, obvious market manipulation occurred from 11/10 to 11/12 or so.
There is too much money in this, you can absolutely trust no one. The mods of obviously have a shit ton of BCH (as many of us do). If they think they can approve a few comments and then dump their BCH at a 4x value, they are going to do it. Similarly, if someone managed to pump the BCH market, and then comes to a mod w/ a plan to to create a diversion on these subreddits, offering a 100 BCH bounty, it's going to happen. 
Bitcoin and Blockchain are amazing because they are protocols with audit-able rules cemented in code. Everything past that - forums, markets, proprietary software - are prone to all the failures of human beings that we have seen in every aspect of life since the dawn of man.
That's your warning - do not get caught up in vs. or any of this other nonsense. Treat these pieces of code for what they are, and look closely at every corner where humans might have incentive to manipulate the systems. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:40:50


You could always trade into something uncorrelated, instead of selling for fiat. Tether would be the obviously example, although not sure I'd trust it right now. Other cryptos like ETH or BCH tend to be slightly correlated, but particularly over short periods of time might be a safe position to trade into.
Anyways, that's just food for thought. I'm just a simple HODL'er. For every time I've considered shorting at the right time ($11k), I'm sure I've also considered shorting at the wrong time (say, $8k during that mid Nov. run up).

For real. It's be really crazy lately. There are some alts I'm getting interested in and want to invest, but no idea if after this recent crypto crash they are still over valued, or what is going to happen.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:08:22
I think there are going to be a small amount of coins that capture the vast majority of the marketshare. BTC will probably dominate for general use, and then you could imagine ETH and XMR holding stake with more specialized use cases. BTC can't (and shouldn't) try to be everything for everyone. 
It's super unlikely all other coins will go to zero and BTC will be the single coin left standing. But it's also super unlikely that we continue to see so many $100mil+ market caps. We'll see the bottom of the market contract, and the top eat up the extra marketshare and continue to expand. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:16:57
In some ways, maybe. It's likely a crypto bubble. I think people just don't know how to correctly value all these crypto coins yet, and so we end up over-valuing coins that much not be worth much, and possibly undervaluing the coins that are actually the most valuable. 
We shall see. My expectation is that after some time a small handful of coins will emerge as the most functional/useful/valuable, and the rest will fall to dust. But until then, I guess make your bets where you see fit.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:17:02
Also - just my own personal theory here - after every price spike basically every corner of the internet begins saying BTC is due for a big drop and price correction. And then what happens... a big drop and price correction.
Could it just be that Bitcoin is volatile and prone to patterns? Very possible. Or could it be that literally every person talking about Bitcoin is talking about how Bitcoin will crash, which causes people to sell, which causes it to crash?
I know we are all strong HODLers and believers here. But I also find it strange that when everyone expects a crash we always get one.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:15:29
Not positive it matters. Depending on what analogy you use, just being the first w/ name brand recognition is probably enough. BTC is a long term store of value, and it's current development strategy is clearly focused on better supporting day-to-day transactions. What else do you need? The concepts are still dead simple - you send one "value" that is backed by verifiable computing power from one address to another. Just making the work well, and cheap, and simple is what's going to capture 90% of the market share.
All the other innovations, while absolutely impressive, are in reality just there to handle special cases. I'm super long on XMR, their tech is killer. But it's not going to replace BTC because it has amazing privacy features. It's going to be there when people want to mix their coins, or buy something they don't want anyone to know about, or for the privacy nuts who just want every transaction to be private. But that's not going to usurp BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:01:55

tehe, fair enough
but that's not actually a totally correct comparison. because right now your bank and credit cards are only private to your friends and neighbors. to the bank and the government, they can easily see what you are up to. so that's not really much different from Bitcoin.
anyways, I do think there will be demands for more privacy. I'm just not positive that Bitcoin proper has to be the one to supply it. can easily be another coin, or some sort of sidechain that does mixing. I don't know. it could also be Bitcoin. just thinking into the future, Bitcoin needs to decide what its core value proposition is, and focus on that.

Ya, exactly. And this is the angle I'm coming from. 
Now, maybe this doesn't make sense to everyone on this board. Maybe there are some younger people with less savings - and in that case, sure put that entire $10k you saved up on summer jobs into BTC. Who cares? It's a reasonable gamble and you have plenty of time to make back that money if you lose it all.

Note to Bitcoin enthusiasts: disagreeing with the above statement, along with the inability to understand why most individuals should not invest more than a couple percent of their liquid net worth into BTC is a serious impediment to the growth of Bitcoin.
"Put it all in BTC" is not viable financial advise for 99.99% of the population. It's a highly volatile asset that has seen record gains, but could undeniably plummet to a fraction of the price at any point. I love Bitcoin, I'm long on Bitcoin, but we also need to understand how to communicate with the rest of the world about Bitcoin. For most people it should be a small allocation as part of a fully diversified portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:52:43
In my book, that's part of a well balanced portfolio. I normally start with a recommendation of 3% to 5% of your total portfolio in crypto, with close to 80% of that in BTC.
If you are an older person looking to ease into 4% year after year return to retire on... maybe don't go any crypto. If you are younger, willing to absorb some loses, I could see up to 10%. Any more than that you have to be seriously well informed and/or some sort of FIAT anarchist. Which is cool, that's fine, that's why we are here.

Possibly. It depends on the asset. If Ripple has an inherent flaw, or proves to not be useful for anything then its value will crash. If Ripple proves to be relatively useful, then the extra pub and support may be enough to push it to a turning point. 
You can look at it like any bubble. Investors flocking to an asset, regardless of quality, certainly bring in a lot of publicity and eventually even more investors. But unless there is some sustainable value at the bottom of that asset, it's a bubble that will burst.

It's interesting, normally huge technological improvements do come from private incentivizations. But in the case of bitcoin, it is decentralized by nature, so the best a private company could do would be contribute to the system as a whole as a means to boost the feasibility of bitcoin supporting a private product. 
I'm not sure how all this will reconcile. My gut is that this will render the bitcoin network relatively slow moving, but overall a highly stable backbone through an otherwise highly volatile crypo market.
