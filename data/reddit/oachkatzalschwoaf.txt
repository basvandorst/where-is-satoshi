But the address with the bitcoins could get tagged and gov. might declare it as illegal(shops, exchanges...) to accept funds from this address?
E. G. If these coins come from a scammer account or  used before by '' terrorists''?

Everybody has to start somewhere. The difference of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is one detail in the huge crypto-Universe. The problem are these apps, which are meant to create confusion, but also as first app for new people(just read all the Treads in r/btc (BCH-sub with btc-ticker?!?) where people are proud that they brought new people to crypto by installing them this app and send them not Bitcoin but BCH which is listed as Bitcoin.

All crypto predictions are pure bullshit. But with enough predictions, one day someone might be right by chance, and then he will be celebrated as new crypto-expert who knows everything, despide all the previous wrong predictions.

So i should convert my Fiat to BTC,
Then send it to a crowdfunding project.
So that the crowdfunding-project can convert it back to fiat, to pay the for the salary/taxes/goods... Of the project?
Hopefully in the near future, adoption will improve this situation, but currently i think BTC is not well suited for this.

You forgot all those useless, dumb, stupid repeating predictions mostly from the same A\*\*holes:
This is the botton, now bull run starts ...
few days later: as you can see the  we see it sideway moving for another month
few days later: the bottom is here after another drop ...
few days later: this diagram shows, that it will go lower after the current surge, but than it will moon ...
few days later: the market is crazy, but this 23 days average is an indication for another drop
... 
a month later: BTC price is the same after the complete opposide all other predictions of what this guy(or financial institution/celeb ...) predicted: you see I'm right with my sideways prediction -&gt; im a crypto expert

Imagine those who exit at 8k durink the short drop, and bought back at 16k.
Then missed to exit down to 4k.
Nobody knows if its just a real crash, or just a short crash and massive pump

Is it bitcoin with the ticket BTC or one of the other shitcoins with another ticker?
Those shitcoins are worth just  a fraction of BTC, therefore 90usd for 0.4 might be possible
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:27:10
My forecast:
The price will go up,
But it could also go down,
or maybe it stays the same.

take out everything you cant afford to loose!
only keep in Crypto values you can afford loose.
What if e.g. Binance or any other exchange that holds your fund get hacked and shuts down (see  Quadriga, Cryptopia ...)
\-&gt; thats why you never should hold your funds on exchanges. 
but also in case of a quick crash you might not be able to send your funds to an exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:51:00
Yes from the 120k to 69k

Send it to the Lightning Network before the needed fees for a transaction will be higher than your 5$
