Lets be serious for a moment. 1MB every 10 minutes results in 50GB/year maximum. 20MB every 10 minutes results in 1TB/year.
1TB/year is quite a lot of space needed to run bitcoin... The current blockchain is 35 GB, the next year after changing to 20MB it could theoretically be 1035GB ...
Take into account the fact that many companies (visa, mastercard, western union and many more) will want to flood and spam the bitcoin network. We saw that it is possible to do during the latest stress testing.

Because it allows me to store value by myself without having to trust anybody and without external eyes (bank, credit card companies, paypal) viewing my money and what I do with it, asking me questions about MY money.
Also, it is much better than any other means since i can encrypt my assets, and if they are stolen, lets say someone breaks into my house and steals my hard drive, I can restore it from a backup. With gold it will be gone.
tldr; its MY money, that I manage the way I want to, and I don't have to trust anybody for it.

Oh you are correct... if i use electrum and import the trezor seed manually, i can then just export the private keys of the addresses... thanks !
