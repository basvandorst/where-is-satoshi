This website Bitcoin.com is a disgrace.... It's the first site I visited to learn about Bitcoin and is fake news geared too promoting his other product... He is infringing on the copyright of Bitcoin ......as a community we should not stand for this....I think everyone here should threaton a class action law suit unless he clearly states that he is associated with Bitcoin cash an alternative product too Bitcoin!

Ill be giving away $100 of free bitcoin to the best answer as upvoted....Until yesterday i had nothing against bitcoin cash in fact i owned some, however as i understand it the owner of the site of bitcoin.com is not a supporter of bitcoin but bitcoin cash... I find this false and misleading advertisng, profiteering and not best practice. What i would like to do is launch a class action lawsuit against the site bitcoin.com for infringing on the bitcoin trade mark. It would be similar if hungry jacks took over macdonalds.com and said hungry jacks burgers were juicer....maybe they are.. but this is a  clear trademark infringment. To win the hundred dollars of bitcoin answer who the best lawyer in the world to fight this case would be and why and the highest upvoted answer will win..... i beleive in  a fair and level playing field for all crypto currencies!

you never reveal all your cards at once...the good things about wallets and blockhain is you can trace everything only takes one domino to fall over and it is extremely easy to prove ---trademark law is very powerful
