If this is not sarcastic, and it may be, I'll bite: If you are relying on the monetary policy of the fucking Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to back up your anti-bank sentiment, then I sincerely don't know what to tell you.
If you are seeing this post and are on the fence about bitcoin, please consider that this subreddit is at the point where they are bragging that they are better than the worst economic collapse in almost 100 years. 
Yes, bitcoin value has gone up (and quite a lot) but why? It isn't backed by anything whatsoever. It is a stock without ownership in any inherently revenue producing institution. It is a currency without any guarantee. Who is profiting? 
I'll wake up tomorrow with this at -300, I'm sure. I have tried so many times to debate with bitcoin fanatics and they never ever actually want to talk about the huge holes in bitcoin philosophy. If I am wrong, I'll gladly be wrong. But this whole movement seems like it is one panic sell tidal wive away from dropping to $100.

Oh come on, this is the most disingenuous shit. 
The US dollar is backed by the largest economy the  world has ever seen. Are you really worried about the Federal Reserve printing money like crazy? If the US ever did that or even hinted at defaulting on its bonds the world economy would collapse. This means the entire world has a vested interest in this not happening.
One too large chunk of bitcoin starts cashing out? It is every man for themselves. Bitcoin is the definition of a bubble but it is even worse - it doesn't actually represent anything at all.
