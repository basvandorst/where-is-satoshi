I have BTC in my keepkey wallet since Sept 2017. How to I claim coins from forks, and which coins can i claim. Does this mean i can cash out of those forked coins and out of BTC?

Nice story, should be published in the reader's digest ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:27:46
Isn't it the other way around? Futures will trade based on price of BTC using fiat. No one going to trade futures using BTC.

BTC is already &lt; (less than) $20k
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:22:12
5k is a phycological point ... U cud anticipate a sell there
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:46:04
Uh-- I do

Whatever it takes to make you sleep better. All that matters is that someone else is left holding the bag. Glad people like u are around ... I need to pass my bag to someone eventually.

Holder don't make money until you sell. I prefer to trade it ... If only coinbase was quicker in clearing my transferred funds from my bank.

i'm about to buy some via coinbase/gdax as soon as my funds clear tomorrow. First time transaction but from what I understand I fund coinbase, free transfer to gdax, buy with low or no fee on gdax, then somehow move btc to my keepkey ... hopefully directly from gdax but worse case xfer back to coinbase then move to keepkey.

Same here ... just setup a gdax acct last week ... could not get laptop camera to take clear enough pic. Downloaded CB app and verified within 2min.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:59:29
thumbs up ... if your plan is to hold on forever then that is a bad plan. I'd rather play this like a stock market and trade it ... except crypto a little easier since you only have a handful of "stocks" (btc, eth, etc) and lots of volume.

Avoid the hassle and fear of getting audited and nutz getting busted in ur ass. Easier to explain money came from Bitcoin investment than saying you saved $250k in cash and proving it did not come from illegal activities.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:30:39
Watch it, the crypto on it may go turbo and be gone forever
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:05:40
Huh? Your making it sound harder that what is it. You pay tax on profits and they end of the year using form 8949. Track buy date/cost basis and sell date/proceeds. 
Why not play the swings and lock in profits. At least to the point where you take out your original investment then play with the houses money. Then hold on to that.  But at some point you need to sell otherwise what is the point.

What movie is that?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:29:21
Tamper proof ... Meaning you can tell it was tampered with. Nothing stopping you from stealing the display , breaking that shit open, and transferring the crypto.
