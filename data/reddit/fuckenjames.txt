I'm just now seeing this, wouldn't this mean BU devs would have been hiding the exploit if they did find it themselves?

So are you trying to reduce the necessary size of the SD card for cost alone? Or is there a performance benefit from using a smaller card? Is there a difference in performance between an SD card and a USB flash drive? Is there any reason why a full blockchain would be less desirable than the pruned chain, if I have the space for the full?

The article doesn't seem to say much, just a bunch of comparisons to support the accusation in the title. Not a lot of faith the author didn't see something mentioned and say "Hey yeah!" and write a quick blurb why they agree. Did Mozilla release a piece of software named after the company?

"We will discontinue paying network transaction fees for on-chain transactions starting March 21st, 2017"


So what is the change then?

It sounds like you're taking human behavior as evidence of a problem with the code.

This is great, thanks! I looked into pulling the trigger on some bitcoin when the price dropped from 1400 down to 900 then up to 1100 and kicked myself for not having paid attention back in 2009. Then I forgot about it and looked again later when it reached 1600 and kicked myself again. But after reading a lot trying to figure out why it was moving so much, I realized it would be near impossible to anticipate and time when to buy and sell and it would not be a viable strategy. Instead I will be buying a small amount regularly and set notifications when the price drops to buy a little more. I hope the upwards trend continues but the relatively speedy increase in value makes me nervous.
