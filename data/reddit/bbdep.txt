I am just saying you're comparing two countries and adding ALL taxes and failing to mention that out of one of the taxes you get something out of it. Aka. You make 30k in the us in crypto you only get taxes X but you still have to buy yourself pricey shitty health insurance vs you make 30k in france you pay Y % but you also get some benefits out if it. For people that are not familiar with those systems it is very misleading.

But there's no reason you would have to pay that on crypto while being French and living abroad...

But to have to pay that tax you would be a French resident, therefore eligible to some benefits under conditions. So i am not sure your logic works. I think one of the only case of paying that tax where you don't get any benefits at all is expats living abroad but owning and renting real estate in France...that was raised in EU courts but it stuck.

Your tax residence usually is what counts unless there are special provisions for crypto. It really is complex and depends on whether you are a us citizen or not and where you reside. I don't think there's a one answer fits all here.

So it is really 19% tax plus mandatory health " insurance" contributions.

They usually call it free because compared to the US it seems free. Major conditions and most chronic conditions ( cancer, diabete,etc..) are fully covered. If you relate it to what US citizen know aka very expensive insurance with high restrictions and where top coverage is usually still only 80% coverage with thousands out of pocket yearly, it " seems" equivalent to free. But you are correct it is not fully free. Even doc visits require a small contribution.

But do you get healthcare benefits with that?

We are talking about the reference to the term "free healthcare" once the social contribution are made ( or the US premium are paid). You are not wrong on your statement. But thats not what we were discussing. The concept of " free" is really " free after contributions were made" and even then it is not really free since there are small payements and the additional mutuelle if people want more coverage.
