I have had Gdax up today and there has been a 20-50 BTC sell order available at the lowest limit sell price and it continues down a lot for most of the time.  Almost like a big seller is trying to get rid of a ton no matter what but just in chunks.

What you’ll do is keep chasing the next best coin that is “better” than bitcoin, until it isn’t, and then see why everyone keeps using, buying, and selling bitcoin. It’s made it 9 years of actual use, compared to all the new technology that is “fast and cheap”, all because no one is actually using that crypto yet. Good luck and I hope you don’t lose to much learning the hard way like i did.

Next miner out is only 16 TH/s from dragonmint, if it’s even ready to ship in the near future. The main problem is saturation of miners at current technology levels, not so much way more powerful machines that will be consumer ready.

People don’t realize that it’s exchanges and companies overcharging them to send, so they jump on the high band wagon fee.  My highest fee has been .0008 and it was a forced fee on a bad platform. They are also mining like 8 blocks an hour this week so speed isn’t an issue either, but “bitcoin problems” right?

The difference is these "sell walls" have been at the lowest price and are being bought up and are dropping down when the price falls.  A manipulative sell wall is placed a little outside the going rate and comes off as it approaches that price.

It’s hard to nail down exactly what bitcoin is. It’s not like any traditional stock, precious metal or currency, it’s almost different parts of those combined. It can be sent at any time based on its usd value to buy and sell things, just like currency. The value of the dollar fluctuates a lot but you just don’t see it. Like how the value of real estate fluctuates pretty wildly as well.

Yes.  The network hashrate has grown a lot this month, but also the biggest pools are well over 100% luck this past few days, which vaults the difficulty way up over what it normally would be even at this high hashrate.

Some thoughts:
1.  Lots of day traders. Selling out for a small loss when it didn’t break out past 17k quickly enough for them. 
2. People who bought at sub 14k last week placing stop limit sell orders so they lock in profit. 
3. Impatient people who see all the small cap coins going 5-10x in a day and want to jump in on that.

Some exchanges charge a higher fee than normal so I don’t really know how much goes to miners and how much they keep. I know bittrex charges a 5 XRP fee to move ripple when my ledger charges .02 or something small like that. 
.001 is a really high fee for a normal wallet and would be confirmed pretty quickly, but since the exchange is taking a haircut than it could be a while based on what fee they actually put through to the mempool.

Difficulty is not continuously upward. It’s reset every 2016 blocks to keep blocks mined at 10 minutes on average. So when more hashrate points towards BTC and blocks start getting found faster, then it adjusts up. When hashrate goes to BCH or other coins and blocks take longer than 10 minutes, then difficultly is adjusted down. 
While the difficulty does normally follow the price uptrend, it’s more profitable to mine BCH right now, so even at the $15,000+ BTC price, I expect difficulty to adjust down on the next reset at this pace.  
The BTC price crashing and staying low would hurt mining, but it would have to be a huge drop from here, and even a “correction” back to $7-10k wouldn’t cause mining to stop being profitable either.

@_date: 2017-12-04 03:36:21
Right now other coins are better based on hypotheticals. Some are faster and cheaper because they are not being used as much. Bitcoin has scaled nicely so far and now is at a stage where the user base is massive. This why we are having block size and lightning network debates. Bitcoin has been adopted and is used, thus creating some scaling headaches. Other cryptos claiming to be better simply aren’t used at the same scale or they would run into similar problems and who knows how they could handle them. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:05:58
The deficit would be rising regardless, even if the tax plan didn’t change. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:54:17
The issue is that the fees have not grown in terms of the percentage of bitcoin, unless people manually set them higher, but they have grown in terms of USD.  A .0007 BTC fee was "nearly free" for almost the whole BTC life cycle, but just recently become too high to send for low transactions.  Almost any coin would have their fees skyrocket in terms of USD if they jumped to the BTC price level and kept the same fee schedule. It's around 0.1 for LISK, .02 XRP and .0002 BCH or higher right now, which would be super high USD prices for fees.
For use cases, I do personally use it for larger transactions that don't need to be instantly confirmed, and I also like the idea of salaries and other larger type payments using BTC, that are cheaper and easier than using banks and payment processors. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:35:41
Transaction fees.

I’ve been recommending Andreas’s videos to new people for awhile. His financial status never crossed my mind and I think him not being a “bitcoin millionaire” proves even more that he can be objective and straight about bitcoin. When you get advice from “owners” and CEO’s of companies, they have a biased agenda to push, even if it’s well meaning. Basically Andreas’s credibility went up in my book and I even went straight to donate after reading this. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:18:59
The btc difficulty adjustment up 18% will cause this type of transaction delay since miners will move to other coins if they are more profitable. That causes the blocks to be found at a slower rate. Bitcoin was designed in a specific way and they don’t change the structure of it to account for temporary fee hikes and longer tx times unfortunately. The fee hikes are also a result of the price increase in usd, as the fee is usually something like .0006 of a BTC, which was a very small amount until the huge usd spike. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:45:26

@_date: 2018-05-28 18:24:37
I already see this in action. Miners who pay more than $5 in electricity/rent all in per day are losing money on ASICS already. If the price of bitcoin does not go up dramatically with the costs to mine, it will be centralized to mining farms who can make their own hardware and run it for close to nothing. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:32:45
I think the S9 is even cheaper these days than the $1300.
It all depends on the cost of electricity.  An S9 generates approximately 0.000829 BTC a day, and that will continue to get smaller as more machines are produced. At this point it would be better to use the $615 or whatever to straight up buy the btc and hold, because mining will get bleak really quick if the price doesn't rise. It's easier to just hold digital currency when you need the price to rise to be profitable, rather than run these machines all the time.
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:23:34
The issue is that it is still very profitable for mining farms and manufacturer's to make, sell, and host miners, even if it's not worth it for the normal guy. The little to medium setups are the ones that are hurting and will hurt the most, so unless the BTC price increases dramatically, all will be left is the huge mining farms working on razor thin margins.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:10:06
I don't think much can be done when crypto is being bought and sold mainly by traders based on speculation.  All of us who want to hold, spend, and use crypto for other things besides trading are in the tiny majority right now. The traders control the USD price.  The only event I see in the near future to soften sell pressure a little is when BTC mining is halved in 2020 to 6.25 per block and half the current mining supply is hitting exchanges everyday by miners.  Obviously other things can happen to lessen the sell supply but as of now we are at the mercy of what traders want the price to be.

To me, bitcoin is very hard to understand, buy, store and use for 99.9% of the population. It will continue to be super volatile until it’s easier for normal people to use or something like an ETF is available for people to get involved without having to know how to use it.
@_date: 2019-10-21 02:01:57

This worked well for me when the hard forks where coming and I figured it would go up closer to the "free coin" dates, so any dips I thought were just minor on the way up to the forks.  I was probably more lucky than anything.   
I got destroyed this last weekend when BCH was around $1600 trying to buy the "dip" from $2400.  I must have made the wrong decision 10 times during the moves from $1600 to $1200, along with the Satoshi losses incurred due to BTC rising the whole time.  Hindsight is 20/20

You transfer $100 usd to an exchange and now have $93 worth of BTC. You then quickly check your wallet and see you have the $82 worth of BTC in your account. A little worried, you then click on the order book to see if you should sell your $62 worth of BTC, and after a second or two of thought you decide to hold the $47 worth and ride out the market. A couple seconds later you get an alert that someone in Zimbabwe doesn’t like bitcoin so now you jump back to the exchange to limit sell your $24 worth of BTC and then see the order book move too fast to sell at your limit. You finally panic and market sell your $7 worth of BTC back to usd and transfer that $7 back to your bank account for a $6.95 fee. Easy.

Being new to crypto but working in other similar markets, I can only say what I think on here so that others can tell me that it's dumb or not...
With that said, While BTC is my biggest holding, and not by much, I'm thinking along the line of what you posted about some alt coins going 5X-10X+, while BTC going up "just" 50% in the near future.  My thinking has been "will coins like XRP, LSK, or OMG out pace BTC in the near future?" and my thinking is yes, but since I'm not sure which alt coin will blow up or not, I'm spreading it among 8-10 coins that I think have that chance, while understanding only 1-2 may outpace BTC during the stretch I plan on holding.  
In the end, I have no clue what's in store but spreading it out into some smaller coins that could blow up seems like the best risk/reward strategy for me.

It took me one day to understand the shortcomings of Bitcoin when I had no clue buying stuff on coinbase. When I  used bitcoin it took a long time to transact and the fee was $5 to send $25 to buy a gift card. I then bought litecoin since it was a lot faster to send and the fee was almost nothing. I see bitcoin as a store of value more than a currency, and that’s probably why we see so many forks trying to make it a currency.

Markup will always be high for the ease of use.

In terms that you can walk up, pay cash and get it instantly. No verification waiting times or KYC from exchanges or long wait times after attaching your bank account to coinbase, etc.

Not a bad plan if it gets you out of debt. Bitcoin is a risky investment no matter how many people think it’s going to just keep going up.

It's hard to talk to outsiders who only hear about Bitcoin in the news. No matter what the price is of BTC, the news either talks about bubbles and tulips when it's rising or they confirm their disdain for it during a dip. All negative in general.  So when I talk about BTC in a little more detail with outsiders, they stick to the media bias talking points and don't even want to try to understand what's beneath all that.  For now, it's better to just talk and learn with other like minded people on places like here.

It works great just doesn't have the apps for all the top coins yet.

The problem may be that everyone else is thinking the same thing.

I'm going to need to restart my computer.  It couldn't handle how quickly BTC fell after the fork.

PM if you have one for sale.

You need to move out of CA ASAP if you believe the things you say. You will get bled to death with taxes, regulations, and cost of living long before bigger national financial troubles happen too.

Fork is at block 491407 according to multiple exchanges.  We are currently at block 491365 
Looks like a block is happening average about 5-10 mins, which puts the fork sometime this evening in the U.S.

Right now on chain fees are almost nothing, so most that haven't switched don't see a need.  If on-chain fees start to rise than I'd bet you'd see more segwit addresses being used.

It's asinine to make the argument between how many merchants accept LN vs BCH.  Of course not many places accept LN payments yet. 
I wish BCH could find it's worth by focusing on what it does well, instead of this blistering effort to discredit what BTC is trying to do.

It was better, faster, and cheaper for the end user. Downloading songs instead of driving to the music store for example.

Exchanges aren't the best for keeping small amounts of crypto on, where the withdrawal fee is a large portion of the balance.  They will drop the satoshi value of the fee as the USD rises though.

Exchanges have fixed fees for sending out to wallets.  This is not the same as a miner fee and is usually much larger than normal.
