316 stainless steel isn't cheap, and we chose to manufacture in the UK to guarantee the materials (316 is often "faked").
We also use more rivets than similar products, and have a thicker 2.5mm central piece to help resist against bending stresses (most options use 1mm, because it's easy to cut using a laser). That 2.5mm piece requires some pretty serious cutting equipment to keep it within tolerances.

A single wallet can store 2 x 12 word seeds, if you want to have separate seeds in the same device. There's still plenty of entropy in a 12 word seed, it's just not "as much".
Alternatively, Simbit is only a couple of mm thick, so they stack pretty well. You could use some threaded rod and nuts to attach them to each other using the existing padlock hole, if you wanted to make sure that you only have the manage the location of a single wallet.
As for "larger" version of Simbit, we can only make Simbit cost-effective by mass producing them. If there's enough demand for something like this, we'll definitely consider it! However, we won't be able to help with a "one-off"" for now...
Hope that's helpful!

No worries, thanks for the question :).

We ran a frequency analysis on the BIP39 list, and each Simbit comes with enough characters to mean that it's less than a 1/1000 chance that you won't have enough.
The most common letters are "a" and "e", so we've also provided extra ones of those.
If you're the unlucky 1 in a 1000, you can either swap the extra letter out for one in a different case (you could use upper case instead of lower case), or generate a new recovery seed (takes almost no effort). 
And finally, if you really, really want to keep your existing seed, we'll send out the missing character/s free of charge!
In summary, it's very, very unlikely, and we have you covered if it's a problem.

Hey, not at all. **We never see or ever know what your keys are**.
We send you a stainless steel wallet that is designed to hold many letters, numbers and symbols. We also send you over 400 letters, numbers and symbols.
You create your recovery seed/private key using these tiles, and store that information inside the wallet.
The only person who ever sees your recovery seed is you. We can't guess what it is, because we've provided you with so many extra tiles (and don't know which ones you use anyway). Everything is done physically, there are no servers involved.
Here's a video so you can see for yourself: [

It's 7mm in diameter. The slight curvature on a shackle means it's best to use a 5mm diameter one.

Hey hodlers!
We're excited to announce the launch of Simbit, a stainless steel wallet which helps you defend your private keys or recovery seed from fire, flood and hackers.
It's not the first metal wallet out there, but we reckon it's the best.
Here are a couple of the key features:
* Constructed using a marine grade (316) stainless steel for superior corrosion resistance
* Stores up to 114 characters, which is more than enough for a BIP39, 24-word recovery seed
* We created a custom font for maximum legibility and clarity, and use an etching process rather than stamping or laser marking the letters, for optimal durability
* Simbit can be locked shut with a padlock to stop someone taking a selfie with your lambo fund
* Each Simbit comes with over 400 tiles to recreate your private key/recovery seed
It's a discrete, strong and simple solution for taking your keys offline, and protecting them from a house fire, burst pipe or some script kiddie...all done using the kind of steel you wrap nuclear fuel in.
It's a wallet designed by metallurgists, and if you're serious about controlling your own private keys, it might just be what you need.
