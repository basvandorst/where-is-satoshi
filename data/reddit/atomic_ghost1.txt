With those kind of returns, he'll be a trillionaire in a few years. 
Or he's lying. Yeah, it's that.

I was going to say wake up and smell the lambos, but this is much funnier.

Im struggling to see what's so bad about what this guy is saying? I dont know much about him, but at face value, what he said seemed just fine.

I remember when I was a wee lad and the family wanted to get worse reception on TV, we'd wrap the antenna in aluminum foil ��

It's bold of you to post here, considering how many people seem to totally hate you. But your statement comes off as pretty fair.
Bitcoin got really popular, really fast while gox was under your control. Considering the increase in attack attempts that must have happened while you were in charge and the nature of bitcoin being what it is and how new it was then, it's not Terribly surprising how it went down. When I was your age, I don't think I could have handled it any better. It's easy to critique in hindsight from the outside like many do.
Good luck going forward. Considering that you could probably single handedly crash bitcoin with what you have in your wallet... Uh... Please don't?

I like it. It could use a few color adjustments though.
As one user pointed out, it loads MUCH faster in mobile than cmc. 
If you can commit to a promise that you won't run ads from obvious scams (like bitconnect) I'll gladly make the switch.
