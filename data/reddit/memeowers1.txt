Were you an adult during 2008/2009? Have you ever lost your job, house, etc.? I don't know how else I can get this point across. When you are in the process of losing everything you own you are absolutely not interested in investing in anything, period. Trust me, I've been there, many people have. I don't think you have been or else you'd understand my perspective.

You're comparing a country who offers no real value to the world economy (aside from oil) to the most powerful country in the world. Also.... if you're living on the streets with no job, no money, etc., how are you going to buy bitcoin? The media has sensationalized the Venezuela/Bitcoin connection for a while now and it is very bogus. Furthermore...... Bitcoin was in a significant bear market during most of Venezuela's darkest moments so obviously it did nothing to help Bitcoin.

Say what ?

Let's talk about perspective first..... I'm from the United States and if the banking system here collapsed the last thing we'd be concerned about would be bitcoin as we'd all be at risk of losing our jobs, homes, savings, livelihoods, etc. The last thing we'd be concerned about in that moment of time would be bitcoin. Now..... if you're talking about the banking system in a small third world country.... that's a different story.

You are correct.

I can understand how it can be good in the long run and grand scheme of things but there will be a lot of pain in the beginning and along the way. If the stock market and housing market starts to tumble you know crypto will too alongside it.

I don't see how you can think this is good for bitcoin either.

Can you expand on that please? How do you transfer funds to gdax to avoid fees? Thanks.

Mostly likely the first thing that'll happen is they'll lose their jobs. Not too long after that they'll lose their homes. All along the way they'll be dipping into their savings trying to keep what they have. The average person won't have any money left over to buy bitcoin. Like I said, in the years after during the recovery it's possible that they'll be interested in bitcoin but not during the "collapse".

I don't see how that looks great from a TA perspective. That looks like a large bearish pinbar to me with a strong possibility of a down year for the 2020 candle.

I'm glad you came back with that because there was a second part to my post. In the moment no one is going to care because they're going to be trying to save their livelihoods. In the years after.... in the recovery... yes it is possible that BTC sees some positive growth from the collapse but it will take time to recover along with everything else.

Lol, never gonna happen.
@_date: 2019-04-25 17:43:43
I’m not trying to give you a hard time, I’m interested, are you just searching for “BTC whale wallets “ or something like that?
@_date: 2019-04-25 16:54:39
Lol, you people are way too optimistic.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:35:12
Hahaa!! This made me laugh pretty hard!
@_date: 2019-04-25 16:56:34
How do you know this, what is your source?
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:19:54
Well bitcoin better get its shit together or they're not gonna trust it either!

I remember someone trying to get me into it back in 2010 or so. The one thing I didn't like was having to give a lot of personal information. Wouldn't have mattered anyhow as I was a broke college student and would have sold it all when it went up a little bit anyways.
