Our economy is mostly a "demand driven" one.  And you are right in that a deflationary currency would incentivize people to save and reduce frivolous spending.  However contrary to many modern (Keynesian) economic beliefs, this experiment could change our economy for the better **if we tread carefully**.  Let me explain.
Encouraging the saving of capital can change our economy to a "supply driven" one **provided** the saved money/capital is not left unused in wallets (a FIAT analogy is cash under the mattress).  This means an incentive will need to be created for the savers in our society to loan their crypto (capital) to entrepreneurs, business, research or simply put the wealth-creators in our society.  These savers will benefit handsomely from the appreciation of their capital + the earned interest on top.
There are many Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects that are being built and tested right now to solve this problem, and some of them will use 'wrapped' Bitcoin as collateral.
The consequences for the wise allocation of capital through more saving and investing and somewhat reduced frivolous 'consumer spending' could profoundly shrink our inefficient use of resources on this planet and incentivize wealth creation at the same time.
DeFi is experimental and will start small and keep growing organically and responsibly if the ideas are sound.  In contrast, many government programs are political thought bubbles, are enormous, completely unaccountable, destructive to the economy and environment and will carry on for decades.  And inflation is a regressive invisible tax on savers by government.

True.  And because Australia is a small rich westernised country, we are the perfect place to experiment with laws such as these.
I believe that other western style governments who are looking to enact similar laws will learn lessons from us and not repeat any mistakes in order to maximise the chance of it passing in their countries.

These technologies won't change the fact that transacting for goods and services in Bitcoin could still be illegal.
And if you make a confidential transaction with a merchant for goods and services, you still have to identify yourself to the merchant in order to receive the goods in most cases.
And if you've acted illegally, even if that law is stupid and coercive and destructive, guess what... you STILL GO TO JAIL.

Negative interest rates won't be as effective if citizens can use and store significant amounts of cash.
If the interest in your bank account is earning -5% and the cash under your mattress is earning 0%, then your cash is a better investment than your bank.

History shows that laws are almost never repealed.  In 20 years (5 bitcoin halvings) when we wish to consume the wealth we created today, I suspect many merchants will PREFER 'hard' money such as bitcoin which can't be inflated away.  Many merchants will setup their business as such to cater to people like me who wish to consume our wealth before we die.
But in countries that adopt laws such as the Cash Ban Law, merchants will be forced to accept fiat money and pay their bills with fiat.
Is a future where merchants are coerced to accept and keep a high amount of 'soft' fiat currency that can be inflated away for their cash flow, a future you wish to see?
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:13:07

@_date: 2019-11-02 22:53:35
Unfortunately the government can enforce this stupid backward law even if bitcoin is completely private.
If you wish to purchase goods and services from a merchant and pay in a future version of Bitcoin that is private, you still have to identify yourself to the merchant in order to receive the goods and services.
I still look forward to the day that Bitcoin has more privacy and is more fungible though.

Yes I'd totally go with a hardware wallet like the Trezor model T or the Ledger nano S but only from an authorized reseller and definitely NOT secondhand.

If this law passes, it will certainly stop me from buying goods and services using my crypto.  I simply can't afford to go to prison for 2 years!
I am not even sure how this law will affect my trading.
The slightest slip up in my privacy can't be erased and as governments employ more sophisticated blockchain analysis tools, citizens are at more risk.  And privacy coins aren't the answer because the counterparty whom the goods were purchased from could leak your identity if they were caught in the transaction.
@_date: 2019-11-03 03:33:46
That's also covered in the legislation.

No problems with gold at all.
But this discussion is less about gold and more about the government telling us how we can spend and store our wealth.
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:26:35
Yep and I'd go further.  A lot of this bullshit inflation theory we are told is to avoid the "deflation boogie man".
But deflationary prices for mobile phones and flat screen televisions didn't stop people buying those products (there are countless other examples).  Deflationary prices ENCOURAGES us to buy them in greater numbers than ever when we are ready to consume.
Deflation will initially encourage many people to save in the short term.  This is a good thing!  Even if those savings are put into the bank, they are ultimately used as collateral for real world investments.
Inflation is the transfer of wealth from the savers to those who are in debt (i.e. the government and highly leveraged entities).  Deflation would be CATASTROPIC to irresponsible governments and force them to reign in their spending.

Thats right, its even easier to jump on a yacht and  coerce someone out of their crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:25:17
I chose to setup an account on a separate bank for any bitcoin withdrawals and deposits.  With the aim of avoiding the situation of this happening and locking me out of my day to day access to my fiat money.
Do you still have an account with another bank that isn't frozen so that you can continue to live and pay the bills?
I've just accepted that banks will behave like this for the next few years until they are forced otherwise by the market.

Yes on-chain Bitcoin payments cannot come close to coping with the demands of even a single country.
But technologies such as [Liquid]( will allow fast inter-exchange settlements and there is the well known and highly scaleable [Lightning]( network as a micro-payments peer to peer channel that will settle on-chain.
As for on-chain improvements, we have had the hugely successful implementation of [SegWit]( which as almost doubled the block-size without the need for a hard fork and still offers lots more room for [growth]( as it's adoption will be incentivised when fees rise.  And with new technologies on the horizon such as [Schnorr]( signatures and [Taproot]( I'd say the future looks pretty bright for Bitcoin.
Finally Bitcoin being hard-fork averse along with the strong innovation are probably the reasons that it is trusted by so many people as evidenced by it's market-cap dominance over the other cryptocurrencies.

Appreciate your sentiment of staying in BTC.
So you're saying that anyone who possesses 13 ฿ will be able to purchase:
13,000,000 x 6 bedroom houses in the year 2030.  ( 100,000,000 Satoshi = 1.00000000 ฿ )
That is 10% of **all** of the houses or dwellings that exist in the United States today!

Reading the [Trezor user manual]( closely and **following their instructions** and [security recommendations]( will ensure that your funds are safe.  That is  importance, even if your understanding isn't where you want it to be.
And if you start small with trading and withdrawing, and setting up your security properly, then as you read the theory, it will sink in more quickly.
So to answer your question, although they are called wallets, think of them as keychains that store your "private keys".  The "backup seed" + passphrase together is your "private key".  And this "private key" is what is used to sign transactions and spend your coins which live on the blockchain.
So in summary, your coins are on the blockchain.  And the private keys stored in your Trezor can unlock and send those coins to different addresses.
The Trezor Model-T is a special computer that cannot do anything else apart from securely storing your private keys and signing transactions.  It cannot be infected with a virus or subject to a keylogger, provided you follow all of the Trezor recommendations.
Hope that helps.

I think it's fair to assume they are acting in their self-interest and I have no judgement against them for doing that.  I respect it.
So let's give them a reason to act in their self interest to scale bitcoin... like boycotting them until they implement SegWit!
They can have both.  SegWit + BNB.  One doesn't preclude the other.
@_date: 2019-04-06 05:18:09
No thanks.  I'll use a reliable exchange that supports SegWit.

@_date: 2019-04-01 06:11:17
Glad you asked!  As it stands I agree with you.  However here are examples of how borrowing is likely to happen while maintaining accountability and the trust-less nature of crypto.  This is quite different to the centralized banking fractional reserve lending practices in use today.
This Decentralized Finance (DeFi) picture I'm about to paint is slowly emerging so take these as broad brush strokes with a generous dose of crystal balling too.
Firstly, wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is an ERC20 token which may give projects such as the multi collateral version of MKR Dai due in Q3/Q4 this year a very useful tokenized collateral.  The Bitcoin wrapping process is certainly not perfect as it's through a centralized 'trusted' body.  BTW the single collateral version of MKR has been a wildly successful test project of sorts since it's launch in December 2017 right before the bear market!
Anyway the owner of the WBTC can mint a certain amount of the Dai stable coin providing they 'freeze' their WBTC in a smart contract controlled by them.  There are many other Decentralized Finance projects in development that use this Dai forming a financial web of sorts--many of them also issue loans.
This is very exciting as the benefits for Bitcoin will be transparency as to how much of it is being locked away in smart contracts as collateral and therefore making Bitcoin an **even more precious 'store of value'**.  The benefit to ERC20 tokens like Dai is significantly increased liquidity which is needed in that project.  The Turing complete programmable nature of money in this form is limited only by our imagination.
This might also be it's downfall too.  We'll see ;-)

Very much agreed about using hardware wallet like Trezor.  I'd like to add the following:
\- backup your seed phrase / Mnemonic and pickup a [cryptosteel with your hardware wallet](
\- learn about BIP39 with passphrase encryption and how to use hidden wallets against a [$5 wrench attack](
\- use exchanges to trade and then withdraw funds to your hardware wallet
\- under no circumstances should you ever let your seed phrase touch a computer or be digitized in any form such as a photograph.  (although in fairness, many do regularly allow their passphrase to be typed into a computer)
\- put a security tag through your cryptosteel, document the number, store cryptosteel somewhere safe, and regularly inspect it.
EDIT: added final two points.
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:41:14
\- Buy bitcoin using FIAT on a reputable exchange.  [Bitcoin.org]( is the official BTC website and [here]( are the exchanges they list in Asia.  Do not get Bitcoin (BTC) confused with other currencies such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) unless you make an active choice to buy one of these down the track.
\- Learn about 2FA and secure your exchange account.  Instead of using Google Authenticator I prefer [Authy]( synchronized across 2 or more devices (and then turn off multi-device after that)
\- Secure your email account with 2FA.  Get a new email if your old one is crap.  Use gmail with 2FA if required.
\- Buy the new [Trezor Model T and Cryptosteel]( together.  Setup Trezor and store your backup seed to your Cryptosteel.  Never allow the backup seed to touch a computer or any digital form such as a photo.  Put a security tag through cryptosteel.
\- Learn about [hidden wallets]( and $5 wrench attack and use this feature.
\- Stick to buying the main currencies.  Stay away from Ripple and bitcoin variants.
\- A good start is mostly BTC and some ETH.
\- Withdraw to your hardware wallet and don't leave crypto on exchanges.
\- Use a reputable password manager (implement 2FA with a [Yubikey]( to document absolutely everything EXCEPT your backup seed.
Most of all don't boast or tell friends or relatives that you are into Crypto.
Good luck my friend.

Pick up a [Trezor Model T + a CryptoSteel](  Advantages are:
\- easy to use touchscreen to quickly enter PIN / Seed / Passphrase.  You aren't dicking around with tiny buttons.
\- it doesn't have a battery and is a very simple design and interface.
\- you can actually read the screen!  And the entire address, not a truncated version.
\- trezor implementation of BIP39 and [hidden wallet]( passphrases is sweet.
\- I personally like that Trezor is open-source because this has made it an easy target for security professionals (often tied to the opposition hardware wallets).  Trezor has a history of responding VERY quickly and openly to bugs and makes quality firmware updates to close off security holes (which always require physical access to the device).
I own one of these and a Nano S but just find the usability of the Trezor to be nicer.  The Nano S is a perfectly capable hardware wallet too and you won't be disappointed with either of them.
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:59:58
Yes, hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger are implementations of the BIP39 standard.  And they have the added advantage of never letting your mnemonic words touch a computer too.

Nobody really knows what will happen.  Most people and governments just blindly blunder along.
But if Bitcoin does become widely used then it could remove the Monetary Policy "lever" that government love to pull.  Broadly speaking, governments get their money from three sources:
1. Taxation
2. Monetary Policy / printing money / inflation (a roundabout regressive way of taxing our savings)
3. Borrowing
I hope one day that Bitcoin brings a shred of accountability to government by gradually removing option 2. and even reduce option 3. one day.
Perhaps we will even discuss the role of government on this sub one day.  It's a long shot.  But letting our imagination run wild, my suggestions would be: Providing a legal framework for voluntary trade to happen.  Adjudicating disputes (through the courts).  Protecting property rights.  Protecting our country and providing a police force.  Perhaps a few more things.  Maybe even roads.  The politicians can keep their $100K lifetime pensions paid in FIAT though.
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:15:05
You are right it is actually difficult to know.  Here is [evidence]( that Binance are  on real trading volumes.
Fake trading is pretty rampant so Binance is often listed further down the list such as on coinmarketcap they list  in the last 24 hours.
Nobody really knows for sure.  They are very likely  and whatever people say their lack of SegWit does have an overall effect.
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:29:36
I'm lobbying for SegWit plain and simple because I think it's adoption makes the Bitcoin network better.  I might be wrong.  But if enough people agree with me and it flies then CZ might take notice and voluntarily implement it.  If people don't agree or are too apathetic then this post will die which is more likely.

Nobody really knows.  A positive news story needs to be seen by a group of new investors who were not burned on the way down which could then cause another positive news story feedback loop of sorts :-)
The mood is definitely changing and more positive on reddit subs.  Many in this space realize that the fundamentals are far stronger.  The average punter in the street needs to get excited which just hasn't happened... yet.  Google searches for bitcoin have been flat over the last 90 days and longer.
I'm going to take a punt that it'll touch the $3k-$4k range for a bit before going up.  My two satoshis :-)
@_date: 2019-04-06 13:34:37
I did make a logical argument my friend.  Here are the assumptions I based my argument on:
\- Binance and CZ are self-interested.  This is a normal and good mode for a business to operate.  (remember self interest generally = serving your customers well.  Profit is a measure of how well a company serves its customers)
\- Most people are emotional creatures whether we like to admit it or not.
\- The Binance technical team have both the competency and capacity to implement SegWit.
\- There are self-interest reasons why it's better for Binance to not implement SegWit (again that's fine, no judgement by me on this at all)
\- Binance don't give a flying toss about level-headed, well thought out technical arguments when these don't align with their business interests.
\- Binance do care about serving their customers and not losing significant numbers of them (see part about self-interest)
Making a purely technical argument is actually NOT logical in this case.  Far from it because it wouldn't have a hope of achieving our aims of having like minded people lobby Binance to change and adopt SegWit.
Juvenile technical arguments that treat humans as if they are emotionless machines downloading cold information but neglecting our self-serving interest will never work.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:39:44
The Trezor Multi-passphrase encryption feature [(hidden wallets)]( is a brilliant solution to this problem.
Each passphrase generates a separate wallet.  Put sufficient crypto assets into your decoy wallet and be prepared to lose them if you are held under duress by a criminal or government.  Some would argue there is not much difference between them ;-)
Keep a second copy of your seed backup somewhere secret in case you are forced to give up your seed backup mnemonic.  Without knowing your second passphrase, the criminal cannot get access to your funds.  They will take funds from your decoy wallet if it is a duress situation.
Your final and best protection is to shut the f&amp;%k up and not make it publicly known that you hold crypto assets.

I wonder how their platform will take monthly bitcoin (subscription) payments without the need for the contributor to perform an action each month. A steady monthly income is CRITICAL to producers.

Ah yes a chance to let our imagination run wild.  I like this question.
YES, A.I could both be a threat to bitcoin security and enhance bitcoin security at the same time.   
Anyway here are a few ways off the top of my head that A.I. could be a threat.
1. Find and exploit unknown coding bugs in the bitcoin implementation.  An example of a known bug is the recently patched Bitcoin Inflation Bug.  This could be the easy low hanging fruit for a super-intelligent A.I.
2. Find and exploit bugs in the mathematical encryption algorithms.  Bitcoin uses secp256k1 elliptic curve with the ECDSA algorithm.  Much of the encryption we use has **not** been shown to be mathematically provably difficult.  There is is no completely satisfactory security proof.  See [ and [  There may be yet unknown ways to derive a private key from a public key other than a brute force attack.  Very unlikely but still possible!
3. And a super intelligent A.I. could harm the bitcoin network not necessarily at the protocol level but harm nonetheless through market manipulation.
4. Widespread yet undiscovered hardware bugs (similar to Meltdown and Spectre in Intel CPUs) could be a useful tool by a super intelligent A.I. to do also do harm.
But remember that a "friendly" A.I. could work to enhance the security of the bitcoin network for many of the same reasons an "unfriendly" A.I. would be a threat.  For example A.I. could be used to discover new mathematical provable algorithms.  [
It may even create it's own code which can be formally verified.  [  Can't wait to see how the future plays out.  It's very exciting!
