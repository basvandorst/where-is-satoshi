Dont be mean. English is not my native language. You only really learn by doing it, dont you?

(I) My god am i this retarded? God dammit. Good research on my part. Being student and all, I might have gotten the wrong idea at some point in life. See this is why I made this thread! Corrections! The most dangerous thing when investing is being misinformed, and investing based on wrong facts!

~~But I think this opinion is wrong. Its not based on gold like the US dollar is. The US dollar will go on even when alot of people dont beleive in it. (It will survibe better). Bitcoin is all about me, you, your boss, and your friends. If people stop beleaving in it, it will reflect on the price much more than on US dollar it would.~~ Im retarded.
Another thing is corporate section, bitcoin doesn't have it yet, so its truly based on private section and the people.
Am I wrong?

Ahh this is what I was looking for! TYVM. I'm probally doing bachelors degree/masters degree on cryptocurrencies. Good thing I'm still on my first year in the school of economic sciences so I have alot time to learn.

And this is important, no economy can thrive if everybody saves. I think this was the point of the comment... Inflation on currencies is 10000000x better than deflation.

Finally a constructive counterargument. Yeah I most definitely shouldnt jump on the ship too fast based on other peoples opinions.
I have been watching alot of videos and done alot of research, but Ill definitely do more. Just getting impatient because of all of the hype, and I wanna make my mind before the next dip. I guess Its always good to remember not to be irrational.
Ill keep on researching!

(I) Yeah thats a good point.
(II) Bitcoin price being speculative is not speculation. The rest of this point is though, but are you saying its not a possibility? If not why?
(III) Manipulation maybe wrong word, though with a few million dollars you really can manipulate a portion of a bitcoin market. (For example you can watch 'Crypto Investor' on YT he has some points on this)
(IIII) That they do, but for how long, when other cryptocurrencies do the same as bitcoin but better. Bitcoin had a pretty scary incident that could replicate: when bitcoin dipped, bitcoin cash rose. When this starts to happen more often, it shows that altcoins could overthrow bitcoin.
