Anybody know how long a SEPA transaction will be? Been waiting 20+ days to connect my bank. I want out of coinbase!

Hi there, I'm still kind of new here. I use coinbase and gdax. I have a few hundred worth in there, whats a secure wallet that you trust?

If you properly understand the risks and can explain it to them well enough, perhaps they'll help you invest through their accounts

I started purchasing on coinbase, great for beginners. Try to space out your purchases to average out how much you're paying.

Yeah honestly I do feel sad that a lot of people were swayed by the FUD circulating. It's unsettling that humans can be so susceptible to it, and it did work on me to some extent. But i hodl'd obviously.

The dnd analogy is fitting! It's very easy to say what you're going to do with the market. But it's not up to you, it's the luck of the draw.

Now would that cost more in transaction fees than to buy a higher percentage or would it work out the same?

Haha no I wrote an extra 0. More like £1000. Also making people feel small over their relationship with money and wealth is very uncharacteristic. Just a friendly reminder :)

Is that what I wrote?! Fucking autocorrect. I meant uncharasmatic
