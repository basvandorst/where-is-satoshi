My investing philosophy could change, but right now holding more than say 5% of investments in Bitcoin doesn't seem, at least to me, to be wise. Of course, that's fine that others are going to. Like I said, I may change my current philosophy, and at times I do see the fragility of markets yet I'm diversified across a lot of different investment vehicles that give me a nice level of liquidity.

Sigh. Honestly... Lets rephrase the question. Are any of you like the OP or are you all libertarian crypto currency anarcho-capitalist types?
Seriously, what made YOU get into bitcoin? It's a very valid question of which I've seen no one answer. This isn't a exclusive club. IMO if you think bitcoin should be used by the masses and take power away from banks etc then you should take the question seriously and give an honest and real answer. 
For me, I have about $100 in bitcoin. I have a ton in stocks.  I can't start investing more in bitcoin until I see a &lt; 7% return y over y. Till then, stocks and other vehicles are where it's at. 
The doom and gloom scenarios do nothing for me. As I think that markets will adjust and try as much as possible to keep funds and things relatively liquid, hence, the stock market and other short terms investment vehicles.

One of the biggest problems I see in this entire thread is the lack of talk about diversification. You mention buying stock in apple, Netflix etc and getting rich quick. The entire market has been down since 2008 and is JUST NOW getting to a point where it's stabilizing back to what it was before the crash. 
Buying one stock won't make you rich, and in my estimation, neither will buying into one cryptocurrency.  I know that's what you're saying but hear me out. 
And to try and forecast markets and commodities too seems foolish as well. Yes, market fluctuations in one market(China) do affect other markets, yet if you're diversified across sectors, midcap, large cap, etc or if you invest in index funds of specific sectors you're already hedging your bets. 
As for governments not paying their debts, shit. Blame war. No one pays down anything completely and until people stop fighting, contributing to proxy wars or trying to start coups in other countries debt will always be a huge issue. 
We are all f'ed somewhat. Regardless of what we do. 
And let's just play the tape to the end. Let's say that governments collapse who will man the power grid, when the money that they recurve in a paycheck has no worth? Massive amounts of people will just be roaming the streets. 
With the amount of actual money not being able to be accessed either via paper money (because of its Inherent unworth) or Bitcoin, or even money market accounts,transferring of money or transactions will be the absolute least of anyone's worries. It will be pure survival mode. 
And considering that the majority of people right now live near a grocery store and don't have a ready supply of food, most will starve in a matter of days or weeks. 
So really, how is Bitcoin going to solve this? Not trying to shit on anyone's parade, I'm just curious. The scenario that was set up was total collapse. And I'm saying we are taking infrastructure etc for granted.

I'm in no way an expert, but the sec _has_ classified cryptocurrencies as assets. I don't see why this wouldn't be legit. However I'd suggest talking with a financial advisor. 
Also, if you're the custodian of the trust, you have a fiduciary responsibility to growing it and not killing principal. Diversify and don't put everything in cryptocurrencies. 
Again, who tf knows. Talk with an ACTUAL financial advisor.

How much were you going to buy? Can you split it in half? Buy a little now and then buy more later. 
I just bought more earlier in the week cuz idgaf about forks. 
Really it depends on your risk tolerance. If you're buying cryptocurrencies than there's a good bet you're somewhat less risk averse. 
Buy what you feel like you can lose. Like any other investment.

Seems like you're putting strangers confidence in themselves to make wise decisions regarding investments and then trying to profit off that. 
To me, it'd make more sense to either learn how to do that yourself, or just hold them. 
The space for cryptocurrencies seems at times wrought with sepculative and unscrupulous people. I wouldnt trust just anyone with managing my cryptocurrencies than me, especially with the volatility of the markets themselves. 
I've been looking into possible index funds for cryptocurrencies but here in the US, Im looking into regulations on whether that's even legal to invest in.

The primary reason people are against it is because of the libertarian / anarchist crowd, that doesn’t think it should be brought up in the first place. Just leave it be. However I for one, think it needs to be treated and regulated like a utility. As a matter of fact, I’m hoping decentralization will destroy everything we know about corporations currently. And government.

At first I was a little irritated that no one would even entertain the idea... now I find it somewhat comical. 
None of us know, yet imo... this ISNT outside of the realm of possibility. 
You guys think Elon Musk invented it? 
Dude is making a tunnel in Los Angeles that goes from his five houses to space x.  That hardly seems decentralized. 
You know what does? Someone who wants to put billions of people in space, like Jeff Bezos does.
These points are pretty salient and I stand by them. 
I also like I said, could care less.

One could make the argument, that all business in America has government backing through tax incentives, loose tax laws, the government looking the other way while large multinational corporations put their revenues in tax havens. 
I do agree with you though, to some degree.... Elon Musk I think is a genius. 
And he’s also a polydidact, or however you spell it. 
And he also thinks similarly to Bezos into SUPER long term into the future.

Where are you guys on that nationwide legalization of cannabis? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:49:02
That’s cool. Your provinces are similar to our states, right? In that they have their own sovereignty to legislate how they see fit, as long as they’re in the confines of the countries federal laws?
Just trying to piece together similarities so I understand. 
One thing you may or may not appreciate: under obama, he put out a thing called “the cole memo”. Essentially it was a proclamation saying that the federal govt wasn’t going to prosecute cannabis laws in states that voters chose to legalize; whether that’s medical or recreational (that last part im not 100% certain, or whether it was _just_ for medicinal. 
Anyway... our new attorney general (guy in charge of enforcing our drug, criminal and other kinds of laws) is a hard nosed opponent of any cannabis legality... and overturned or chose not to honor that cole memo. 
He made a recommendation recently that said that state attorney generals could prosecute at the federal level, at their own discretion. This to me, is ironic because the Republican Party (of which he’s a member) has this stance of “states rights”, being that they as a party value the states’ decisions in regards to their own laws and prosecution of said laws.
Anyway, long story short: the states that have chosen to a) decriminalize or b) legalize to some capacity consumption of cannabis have, for the most part, decided to not prosecute anyone that’s acting within the laws of the state they’re a citizen of. 
Which I find awesome.  
America has a history of enacting laws that are designed to continue an underlying bias towards prosecuting certain people groups, whether by race or class. 
It hasn’t stopped Trump from saying just today, that he thinks that they (the federal govt) should promote the death penalty for “drug dealers”. 
Meanwhile, we have a “opioid epidemic” that was propped up and propagated by pharmaceutical companies (Purdue pharmaceuticals, the makers of OxyContin) who regularly gives gobs of money to govt officials campaigns. Lololol
America’s govt is fucking moronic and transparently hypocritical and _fucked_. 
P.S. our federal attorney general is Jeff Sessions, is a known racist, judging on his legislation record... and he also is like 4 feet tall (an exaggeration) and looks like a weasel muppet / troll hybrid with beady eyes and a mouth that looks like an asshole. Which is fitting, because the only thing I ever hear come out of his mouth looks and smells like human shit. 
P.P.S. Sorry, I thought we were in r/trees

I see no point in this news doing much. The UI and cognitive hurdles to even _understand_ bitcoin is lost on a lot of people.

Something happened to the Tea Party. I don't know what it is. I have a feeling it was usurped by the Koch brothers and other special interest groups like big oil. This coupled with a pro business / corporate slant / we hate the president because of taxes (on what, really?) kind of made the Tea Party go a little insane. 
I was a tea party type person, voted in the last election for Gary Johnson. Now I'm voting for Bernie sanders. I know. Weird right?

I know. The more I learn about Bernie sanders and look from a moral standpoint (I can't help but see the value in doing more for less fortunate people.) the policies and things he's about make sense. 
I was always for less is more government in the sense that I feel that government is oppressive by its very nature. That being said, to me, Bernie sanders seems honest and the least oppressive. Also, he has some views that are somewhat libertarian. Leave other countries alone, voted against the Iraq war, etc.
