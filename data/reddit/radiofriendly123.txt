Screw Forbes and any article they write about bitcoin. Forbes has bashed bitcoin and spread fud for years about crypto. Cheers to the multiple online forums and communities that have worked together to move crypto and blockchain tech forward in a positive manner. Sorry, Forbes - you blew your shot being welcome in this community. Take your 5 stages and share them with the other clueless dinosaurs.

We all love crypto. We all love blockchain. We believe in it. Having said that, how impactful have either been to date? When is the last time you used litecoin at the grocery store? Who has their house deed and auto title on blockchain? Who's employer has announced that they are converting a current system over to blockchain? I work for an IT company who provides support for hospitals across the country. I asked our products director if we were going to begin utilizing blockchain tech for anything in the future and he looked at me like i just invented a new word.  He was clueless. It's not the media turning on blockchain necessarily, i don't think. It's the lack of any notable progress being made.  The massive amount of attention and money that came to the space in 2017 might have come a year or two too soon. People are expecting results and adoption and all we've accomplished so far is pumping dogecoin to $2 billion market cap. For this all to be successful we need to start seeing real world application and adoption... sooner than later. The world is not very patient. Do i believe? Hell yes... but we've got to start implementing uses in addition to treating this like a new stock market.

I did read it. Loved that bubble comment they couldn't wait to put at the end. Read between the lines on this one and any of their articles about crypto. They are no friend to crypto. Just calling them out for any newcomers to the space.

 Hits me every time as well dude. I found the solution - stop chasing. Find a few coins you like and hold them. Stop trying to keep up with the latest Reddit-shilled coin or you'll always get burned. Research it, buy it, hold it, enjoy the gradual success or, if you're lucky, the massive pump when it happens. If you do buy high and you still like the coin and it dips - hold on anyway! The value will most likely go back up and you won't lose out on massive money.

Let them laugh. Here's why they laugh - They all wake up in the morning, pull out their cell phones and plug in to the 24 hour news cycle. That cycle is filled with articles who's titles read "bitcoin is a bubble", "bitcoin is for drug dealers and terrorists", "bitcoin is bad, mmmkay". They fear it. When people fear things they blast them. Just look at people's original responses to email, texting and the internet. Hell, there's still some old timers who lament and fear these things. Crypto is no different. In ten years most who are blasting it today will be on board. Some curmudgeons will always hate it like we see today with cell phones... gotta just leave these folks in the dust where they prefer to live.

Scarce = limited amount to go around. There is something like 7.5 billion people on the planet. There is not an unlimited amount nor can more must be created if someone decides they need more (cough, governments). Therefore, it is scarce.

Hmmm... I've more than quadrupled my life's savings. More importantly, I've participated in a movement that will be beneficial to world citizens in many, many ways. Very proud to be a part of this movement that is still only just  beginning. The money on the investment side is nice, but the long-term benefits that will be enjoyed by people around the globe is far more exciting.

Hmmm... can't it evolve though? There are several alt coins that'd superior as an exchange medium, right? So can't bitcoin be like my savings account and litecoin or vertcoin, for example, be my day to day spending account as adoption occurs?

I think monero could be a great choice for your savings! That's the beauty of all of this. Bitcoin may be the most popular, but it doesn't mean it's the best/only option. So long as monero retains its value and other people use it and find it to have value it's a great option.

 The segwit 2x fork has been cancelled. In my experience it has been best to buy bitcoin now and at cost rather than waiting for dips. The longer i waited, the more expensive it became. I recommend figuring out how much you wish to invest per paycheck then making it so, regardless of the cost every payday. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:37:14
Both. I view bitcoin as a hybrid of my retirement/savings account. I plan to use another coin, perhaps litecoin, as the equivalent of what would be my checking account today. I do eventually plan to spend my bitcoin... but it might be converted to another coin before i actually spend it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:59:45
They do, absolutely. OP - double check your balance. Coinbase locks you in. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:21:14
Absolutely. I'm going to love watching this transition unfold over the next few decades. All these power hungry nations, entities and people will slowly lose their power. They're going to kick, scream and kill along the way, but they'll inevitably fail.

This is a concern. Governments have often squashed something that is good for the people in the interest of its own pockets.  I've wondered if the bitcoin community would be wise to create some sort of ad campaign providing truths and benefits of crypto before the government can run their full fledged smear campaign about how it's only for drug dealers and terrorists. I was thinking how nice it would be to see some pro crypto commercials on Monday night football spreading the truth about the advantages vs currency as it is today. Thanks for posting this.

As far as i understand, bitcoin will become more and more stable as its popularity grows. Once upon a time there was far greater instability compared to what we see today. As widespread adoption occurs the fluctuations we see will become smaller and smaller. Think of it like you do the dollar today in terms of the power of the dollar fluctuating. The dollar may be more or less valuable today than it was 24 hours ago. One day bitcoin will be every bit as stable and more than traditional currencies (or should i say legacy currencies?). Especially because it's deflationary rather than inflationary. So, today, merchants should LOVE bitcoin because what they accept today will most likely be worth more in just a month and their fees to accept it are a fraction of what visa, discover and amex are charging them. By the time bitcoin is fully stable they'll continue to enjoy the lack of fees that will be associated with accepting cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:09:27
Honest question - isn't this all the more reason to get into bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:41:08
I highly urge you and others to require two-factor authentication to ever move any of your bitcoin. Best of luck. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:25:05
To clarify - that is why merchants should want to accept it as payment, not what would make it more stable. Poorly written on my behalf after rereading. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:05:58
Congrats on your first purchase. It's an exciting thing. Yes, using your bank can take 5-7 days. Using a card is instant, but you have lower weekly limits. You can also use PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:27:29
I think of bitcoin as more of my savings account. I plan to use a different currency for my daily spending once we have more adoption out there. Perhaps litecoin, for example, will be more like my checking account vs bitcoin as my savings. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:45:27
It'll be back. Matter of time. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:56:22
Ah, gotcha. I also wonder if it can be used for day to day currency. All of my doubts or reasons to be confident are still rooted in ignorance as i don't yet have a full understanding of it all... how it works. Still working to be more informed. I'm doubtful because i hear all of the concerns about slow transaction speeds. I'm confident because merchants should love the lack of fees that come along with accepting bitcoin. Back and forth, back and forth for all kinds of reasons supporting either argument. I do think the positives will outweigh the negatives once more time has passed and things have developed/become easier to use.

My take? They're brainwashed to hate it. Every day they see 10 stories written by Forbes, bloomberg, and cnbc that says bitcoin uses more energy than a small country, funds terrorism, is used for nothing but purchasing drugs or laundering money, etc...etc...etc. The 24-hour news cycle is brutal on bitcoin. Another reason is that many view bitcoin as something that is specific to millennials and there is nothing people hate more than millennials in America. This is going to be an uphill battle to get people to see the benefits of incorporating crypto into our society.
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:49:14
Can't banks and crypto live side by side and work together? I typically envision both of them existing and doing what they do best for the customer in economies across the world. A bit utopian, perhaps? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:13:47
Amazon wants it because they'll pay less in fees than they do today to credit card companies and banks.  Also because transactions will truly be final for them, unlike today. You want it because you won't have to put your credit card linked to your address and ssn online. You want it because when you travel you won't need to lose money exchanging it.  You want it because there will one day not be an extra step to do so, as you accurately mention would exist today. You'll want it because Amazon will reward you for using their coin or certain coins for transactions.

Do they chastise the usd for money laundering, buying drugs or the like? I haven't seen it. They focus on straw man arguments rather than how the current obstacles can and will be fixed. I don't dissuade any facts or discussions.

When you slide your card to pay for something the merchant pays the fee.  There is a fee there and they pay it for you. 
You send $2,000 to someone in Thailand using western union. I'll do the same using litecoin. I'll do it within minutes for less fees than you in a fraction of the time.  
Make the government use a public ledger so every penny they spend is accounted for and available for review on a public, immutable ledger... or let them keep playing with cash.   
Have your insurance, ID, medical records and your wallet all on your mobile phone, in your possession. Make a trip to the dentist cheaper and easier than ever before with one smart contract that can be transacted from your mobile phone without loads of paperwork and weeks of waiting time while intermediaries figure out what to charge you (and put in their pockets).  
A hacker breaks into your bank's system and steals everyone's account numbers and social security numbers. Can that hacker do the same to a decentralized entity? 
There are all kinds of reasons for both conventional means and crypto to exist (read coexist). I champion the evolution and adoption of this new technology. I challenge the antiquated systems of the 1900's.  
Good luck with your perspective.
