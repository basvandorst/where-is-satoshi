Well this doesn't seem to be helping. It went down to 38% and is at 41% right now

Pump and dump happens in all coins you noob. Bitcoin is being pump and dumped at this stage even. Interesting you saying mined by a small group of individual while BTC can ONLY be mined with a decent return by a small group, o the irony.

I hope this answers some of your questions :)

Quark is not pre-mined. It was fairly announced and open to everyone to mine it who were interested. If you are interested in alt-coins then you would have noticed Quarks announcement. If you didn't than please blame yourself. It was designed to mine it faster to get the coins in circulation and getting it distributed very fast.  it's almost distributed as well as LTC.

If you have 2FA enabled on exchanges can the still hack it if they know your pass?

You fanatic bitcoiners see everything as a scam/pump and dump, hilarious

Then good for you don't invest in it nobody forces you anything. Traders can take their own responsibility, they don't need you to teach them what's good or not. Mining drawback is trying to be solved. Some already have suggested some solutions. Also the promoters in the media of a certain coin usually have invested themselves in that coin look at BTC winklevoss, they also have huge amounts of BTC same goes for LTC look at the rich list, so its natural

For BTC to gain mainstream and used globally it has to be $1million each. That not happening, there have to be other coins swell. You are just mad LTC is crashing and blame it on QRK
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:10:06
OP is just butthurt his beloved LTC/investment is crashing . He thinks QRK is taking the attention away from LTC thats why he hating on it.

The mining aspect doesn't have anything to do with the coin itself. It's legit and has unlike LTC different worthy features.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:56:25
+1 I don't know why some are frustrated. If you think about it than BTC is a scam and pump and dump too. QRK has some benefits also that BTC doesn't have either. But Litecoiners have a big competition right now

I'm pretty positive about qrk, unlike ltc it brings some interesting features
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:40:52
Just a matter of time, this will happen within some days. BTC is legit now
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:23:11
Just because you didn't mine early doesn't mean it was pre mined. They were open about it and the community is mining it not only the devs and it's an only CPU mining coin which has its advantages over bitcoin which is getting centralised, also i heard qrk worked by some guys who also worked on btc 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:11:03
I heard the guys that woke on QRK also worked on BTC
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:47:40
Atleast it's not a copy cat of BTC like LTC and other alts are, some are very impressed by it's features which is different than BTC, now bill and max promoting it is the icing on the cake

Sorry but the majority of all the bitcoin is in the hands of a few, the average person has less than 37 BTC. Overal the hate that BTC and LTC fans are giving is not fair if you consider how BTC/LTC has been through all these judgments itself. Without keiser LTC would struggle to break the $5. Same goes for LTC if you look at the rich list. In all cryptos there will be bigger whales not only QRK, although it has a 0.5% p.a. inflation rate which does something against hoarders unlike BTC/LTC which doesn't have it.
