The obvious point is that just because michaelhorton has never had a problem with them does not mean that he won't, or that others don't, and mentioning that is of zero value to this thread.

I've heard conbase is pretty bad.  Coinbase however did pretty good once I was able to contact support.

Forgive me for being a dunce, but I just registered and it says I'm being confirmed in the blockchain.  I used an address that I control; how does the "confirmation" work?  I know nothing about namecoin...

I already do that with my cold storage, but I just run regular enencrypted wallets printed to a locally attached printer for offline paper wallets.  What does the BIPS encryption do?

I think it's on the way.  The main focus of the devs seemed to be getting the IPO burn done and then moving to DEX functionality.  Both have been achieved, and the cuddly GUI / FAQ etc etc seems to be what's next.

I would be pretty careful with BIPS.  They got "hacked" in November last year, around 1300 BTC disappeared.  No evidence was ever given that that it was an actual hack.  IMO the owner Kris just pocketed the loot.  I'm amazed they're still in business.
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:29:58
I don't even use the Blockchain app, I just browse to blockchain in my browser and it works fine.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:17:30
It's probably being downvoted by BIPS themselves; they sent me an email accusing me of spreading false rumors yesterday.

Hard to say...they're competing currencies.  Both solve the fungibility issue, but DASH does a lot more.  The masternode network is a big deal, and allows for  instant confirms, voting, etc.  That said there was an initial distribution issue which some call a premine.  I own both, but I have about 10x as much invested in DASH as Monero.

@_date: 2016-03-10 18:16:10
Which you're trusting them to implement properly.  The whole point of BTC is to not have to trust a third party, period.

DRK was rebranded as DASH and is alive and kicking.  It's now a self-funding DAO with distributed masternodes, a voting mechanism and solid devs.

@_date: 2017-01-13 19:35:23
Nice shill account.
This isn't a transfer issue, this is an exchange unilaterally cancelling an order with no notice at a time of great market volatility.  Which should be of concern to their customers.

I hope so.  I'm not done accumulating.

@_date: 2017-01-13 19:09:09
Riiight, but this isn't a money transfer problem. It's them flat out dropping a sale ticket. Right now I'm losing out on another opportunity because they straight up dropped the ball. 
But hey, keep apologizing for them kiddo.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:32:37
You're making a host of assumptions. I made financial plans based on the stated timeline in the email, which is not unreasonable.  Stop white-knighting their failures.
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:31:02
Which is just stupid.  They're already a market maker receiving a cut of all transactions...how much gravy do you need?

For that to happen Coinbase would have to answer your customer support request in less than a week.  Good luck with that.

I guess there was an implied assumption that when BTC is mainstream the price will be more stable.  Either way, when I make transactions with BTC I don't have to worry about crap like this.
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:08:17
If one of these were within driving distance I would buy more bitcoin.  Probably several of my friends would buy bitcoin, and i'm not even a a fanboy.   Just people ive chatted with about it.  Buying BTC is still a huge pain in the ass for most americans.  I think once it gets easier the floodgates will open.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:44:58
No because I had turned off overdraft protection on that account.  The whole point of it is so Paypal can't unilaterally pull money from my bank unless I fund it.  Either way the fee is the same.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:46:17
Cost me money too.  I'm a woodworker. If I'm not making product, I'm not making money.  Time literally=money for me.  So tack on an hour of my shop time to the fee.  Goes both ways dude.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:22:27
Meh...Paypal said the transactions (small refunds for combined shipping) would be processed via "Instant transfer" from my account.  They actually processed it two days later, and by then I had swept the deposit account clean.  My fault? Sure.  Worthy of a $108 payday to my financial institution?  Hardly.  They charged me three separate $36 fees.  I asked them to just charge me one and they refused.  I find this unacceptable.  Hence my cheering for BTC...as I mentioned, in a pure BTC environment, shenanigans like this simply can't happen. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:15:03
Changing commercial accounts isn't very easy...have to get checks printed, change deposit for merchant accounts, etc.  So no, I didn't today.  I'm doing a bunch of work on the site and on my accounting and order fulfillment systems in January, and I wrote it down for then.
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:07:27
I wouldn't switch.  All of my sales are online and about half are international.  I end up paying about the same as you do.  Authorize.net will lure you in with a sweetheart deal and then bump the fees incrementally month by month until you're right back up there.  All of 'em do it.  Can't wait for widespread BTC adoption so I can get away from these fucking thieves giving me a haircut every time I turn around.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:34:46
I somehow doubt any man hours were involved in this transaction.  It was wholly automated.  Including the skimming of $108 out of my account.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:19:53
As I said before, I'm not denying responsibility for the NSF occurrence.  I'm saying that charging me $108 for $45 worth of underfunded transactions is excessive, especially given the fact that I have two other accounts with the bank which have plenty of cash in them.  Apparently many of you feel that amount is just fine, and I guess that's where we differ.  C'est la vie.  My point stands; had the transactions been carried out in BTC I would have been able to correct the error immediately and without incurring the "service" fee the bank charged.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:24:35
Well, I think categorizing it as trying to take money that wasn't mine is a bit harsh.  I have a couple other accounts with the bank that have plenty of cash; far more than enough to cover the $45 in transactions. Fair point that overdraft can be positive...I wouldn't know, I never overdraft.  I just sometimes don't have the money in the right account ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:34:15
I think this is like dividing by zero :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:31:13
That would obviate the point of having the deposit account. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:15:29
Sorry you feel that way.  No reason for me to lie ;)
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:18:51
You guys can white knight for the banks all day long...fine w me. I'm not denying culpability for the transactions. All I'm saying is a) $108 in fees to electronically decline three transactions is excessive and b) I'm looking forward to widespread adoption of BTC since things like this won't happen. That's all, pretty simple! OK, off to make more puzzles :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:13:34
The only bank services I use (deposits, hold a balance, spend with debit/billpay) can be done in a BTC world with a blockchain wallet.  So I don't know which services you refer to.  If it's "hey there's no money here so we won't pay this", again, blockchain does that for free vs. $108 for the privilege from my current financial institution.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:17:00
I did opt out of overdraft when I created the account.  They hit me with NSF fees (which are coincidentally exactly the same amount as overdraft fees).
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:45:38
I accept BTC and do not convert it into fiat.  I'm actively asking my suppliers to accept it as well.  Gotta start somewhere...

You don't lose until you convert to fiat.  Just sayin'
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:22:15
Not an issue if the Paypal transactions don't go through.  In that case I would have realized the error, funded the transactions, and everything would be peachy keen.  FWIW I'm not blaming anyone but myself.  I just feel the fees are excessive and look forward to being able to skip the bank and use BTC directly down the road.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:17:25
