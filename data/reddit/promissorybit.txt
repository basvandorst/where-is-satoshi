With the greatest respect, I listened to the above podcast and my ears started **bleeding**.
If you're not even aware of Fractional Reserve Banking or the creation of money Fed or otherwise, you should not have swallowed the **gobbledygook** AKA **Kool Aid** that dumb and dumber were selling you.
Anyway... as a start please watch the video that suggested....

You're stranded on a deserted island with 6 Gold Bars, 6 Bitcoin, 6 Barrels of oil, 60,000 Dollars, and 6 Bottles of water, what has the most value?

Maybe Richard Branson and the newly formed "**Bit**derberg Group". ;D)

No problem, it's good to know how other people perceive their reality. 
All value is subjective, gold, bitcoin, fiat, cars, good or services et cetera.
Fiat, for example the USA dollar, is the world reserve currency, only for the fact that it's the main fiat currency exchanged for oil.
The most valuable commodity on Planet Earth is **time**, yours or anybody else. 
I could go deeper into the rabbit hole, but I don't have the **time**!. ;D)
