yes i know. my question is just a hypothetical if bitcoin wasn't the first crypto

why would your account be closed?

it's being used more of a store of value, than as an actual currency used to trade for goods and services. Not really surprising with transaction fees of $30+ that take hours if not days to process.

Bitcoin cash is superior in every way to bitcoin core in terms of being a currency. Using bitcoin core to make transactions results in monstrous fees and days worth of transactions times, which is just unbearable in this day in age.

looking at your website it has the value $83 million plastered all over it. I assume this value was calculated at the time when bitcoin was surging at 17k+. My question is now that bitcoin is hovering over 13-15k range do you regret not cashing out all of your bitcoins beforehand when it was at its ATH instead of holding onto it and losing value?

I don't know how big his taxes is that he is willing to lose tens of millions in profit

because nearly all alts are pegged to the value of bitcoin. you need bitcoin to buy most alts, altcoins are not really bought with fiat.

dropped 4k in the span of 2 hours. your average joe who bought in to bitcoin a couple weeks ago after hearing about it on the news are probably scrambling to sell it right now fearing of losing all their money. everything is going to start crumbling down.

bitcoin will drop below 10k by the end of the year, and will be below 1k by the end of 2018. lightning network won't fix its core problems, and other altcoins with better features are eating away at its market share as we speak.

have fun with your dated technology that is constantly bleeding value each week
