Just buy now and hold. Remember Pe^(rt) for compounding growth? The amount you buy is just a scalar multiplier so don't worry too much about how much you buy. Worry about when because time is in the exponent. If you think bitcoin is sound then buy some, if only a little, now.

Litecoin is downstream of bitcoin, like Ubuntu is to Debian. They copied the bitcoin code, changed a few things, and started with a new genesis block. Still copying bitcoin. The question is what does lightcoin offer that bitcoin doesnt? Any problems it isn't facing aren't technology related. Bitcoin has problems because it's popular.

Bitcoin is either moon or zero. There is no sense for in-between bitcoin. That's why I invested. It's also why I have a hard time investing more. As my wealth in bitcoin grows, so does my confidence, but at no point does my confidence/wealth ratio exceed my original bet. So I hold, don't buy, don't sell. Glad I did. I'd advise against dollar cost averaging, honestly. If moon then you'll soon be putting in a year of savings for something that used to cost half a day's wages. Moon or zero. Figure out how much you want to bet and then buy some. Perhaps average over a few weeks or so. But I will say this. Anyone without some exposure to bitcoin is a fool. You need some, at least $100 worth in case btc takes over. You'll need several times the fair (per capita) allotment of 0.003 BTC to maintain a first-world lifestyle.

Yea. This fucked my Trezor order. Coinbase wallet says I sent X coins, both when I sent them and now in the history. But in the block explorer I see only X minus fees went to the payment processor. Trezor cancelled my order and refunded my money. This really sucks because I just clicked "pay with wallet". My android opened my wallet app with the address and amount plugged in. I flipped screens to check the amount and address, then sent payment. Shit is broken by default.

Use bitaaddress.org to generate BIP38 paper wallets with a strong passphrase. Print to pdf and paper. Name the pdf something mundane, encrypt it e.g.  'gpg --symmetric proposal.pdf', and store it online. Store the paper in a secret place.
Obviously there are ways to reduce risk in the process. Download bitaddress off github and compare the sha checksum to the one at bitaddress.org. Put bitaddress on a usb stick and generate wallets on an offline machine. Encrypt the pdf on the offline machine too. Have bitaddress print several wallets and divide your fortune among them. That way you only lose a fraction of your coins when you sweep a paper wallet using a compromised device. Never decrypt your pdf and enter the BIP38 password on the same device. Instead, supposing you lost your paper copy, you would decrypt the pdf on a fairly trusted laptop and then scan one QR code and enter the wallet password on a fairly trusted smartphone.

Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying nearly assures you'll lose some but almost eliminates losing them all.

A private key is a 256 bit number. Almost every 256 bit number except 0 and a range of very high values are valid. **You can generate a public key from a private key.**
You can generate a private key from SHA256(password). This is a brain wallet where you only must remember your password. Terrible idea, BTW.
You can create a better version with SHA256(entropy + password), but then you have to also save your entropy in order to regenerate the private key. BIP38 paper wallets do something like this but uses AES for password encryption.
Modern wallets use a seed to deterministically generate sequences of private keys. You can regenerate all your private keys from the seed. Why? Because one private key is never enough. Privacy, change addresses, and security are all better with a sequence of keys.
Disclaimer: I'm a user not a bitcoin dev. Some of this may be subtly wrong in terrible ways.

I told everyone in 2011 but didn't push it. It's amazing the amount of ridicule people had to give. I didn't even buy very much myself because it seemed crazy. I knew it was disruptive enough that I needed protection from it and that I could obtain this protection through purchasing some. Bitcoin would probably just die but, I thought, what if it doesn't? So I put a few hundred in to it and told others they may want to do the same. Ridicule. They told me I was a fool and that bitcoin was a scam. I didn't argue because I half agreed. But still, what if bitcoin is not a scam? The thought scared me.
Recently one guy was on FB posting articles... "oh if only I had bought in 2010". I know he remembers me talking about it when it was less than $10. I don't like or reply of course. I can't think of a reason.
Now, in 2017, bitcoin is very much in the same place it was in 2011. People still call it a scam. It still grows exponentially. There are scandals and crime. There are lots of n00bs. So, just buy and shut up. People will figure it out eventually.
It's almost exactly like it was in 2011. This just shows how early we are on the curve. There are only ever 21 million bitcoins, and some are lost forever. Right now there are 7 billion people and by 2050 there will be 9 billion. That's less than 0.003 bitcoins per person to go around. 0.3 bitcoins is 1000 times your fair share. Think about that. Don't try to explain.

But I suspect they're really around $4k/mo and most owners are accepting about 3% cap. Then they count on their return from inflation/appreciation. That's pretty typical for an established neighborhood in a big city during good times. Houses are overpriced as capital, yes, but unless rent on a $1m place dips well below $4k I wouldn't worry too much.

Old post but... whatever you choose, break it down into several wallets. If your Trezor breaks, how are you going to feel about entering the seed to your entire holdings into a new device? This problem exists for both paper and hardware wallets. Assume that eventually you will need to trust a new device with the seed or key in order to spend. Losing 10% of your money is better than losing all of it. Divide your wealth now so that you never have to trust all of it to one new device at a time. Also, you probably don't want to buy coffee from the mafia from an address containing 50 BTC. You want your change addresses to show reasonable amounts since you never know who you're dealing with.

A reliable transaction will currently run you about 0.0009 bitcoin for one input with two outputs. That's how bitcoin normally divides an address holding coins into both a payment address and change address when you spend. If you're sweeping several old change addresses into one spend then it may cost more. So, if you want to keep your miner fees less than 2% then don't buy less than 0.0009 / 0.02 = 0.045 BTC. If you're not going to transfer off an exchange until you have bought more or if you don't care about paying miners fees then by all means buy 0.00000001 bitcoins.

I can live the good life from my job. I bought in with about a day's wages at middle class income in 2011. The money has grown over 200 fold since. Enough for a shiny toy or a modest house in midwest suburbia but not life changing. I won't touch it until it's grown another 200 fold. Much more than that and we're in world-war territory as fiat everywhere fails. No one will have a good life then. This was my original plan, actually. I didn't buy it to get rich or to live the good life, nor did I buy it to change the world. I bought it because the world is changing, because bitcoin is disruptive and dangerous, and because I needed to hedge against the consequences. I may never sell.

Best way is hidden in plain site. I'm sorta against paper wallets and hardware wallets for this reason. They're obviously bitcoin and in many cases they will expose the public key. A crazy woman or the state could take them. This opens you to wrench attacks. A jealous x-wife and a good lawyer could make your life hell if they knew how much BTC you had at some point in the past. Just hide it. My suggestion is to use pgp2/GnuPG to encrypt a wallet or wallet seeds and then name the file to something totally unrelated to bitcoin. The type of wallet doesn't matter, but it should be somewhat future-proof. A PNG of a paper wallet would work, for example. You could also encrypt the 24 seed words for a wallet and then destroy all copies of that wallet, only saving the seeds. Memorize your password to this encrypted file and send it far and wide. Put it on your webserver. Email it to mom. Blast it everywhere. You can even email a "sorry wrong attachment" reply after the payload is in your sent folder.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:18:33
Addresses reuse is bad. You should only fund the wallet once for optimal security, privacy, and fees. You should also sweep the paper into wallet software to spend it and never use the paper address again. So Yes, you always move everything. That's the downside of paper. Fund once, sweep once. I have some wallets that I've funded several times. It works, but it's not ideal. Partially spending a paper wallet is more dangerous and I don't do that.
Sounds shitty but let's be real, you need to keep most of your paper wallets in fairly small denominations anyway. This is for privacy. You don't ever want to do business with someone and as a side effect also let them know the precise amount of ransom you'll pay. This is why I make several pages of wallets with several on a page. Fund once, write the amount. Sweep into wallet, cross it off. I believe 0.25 BTC wallets are a good place to start. Maybe have a few 1 BTC ones. Then throw the rest into a few giant ones you'll divide up later. It's hard to predict both the value of BTC and fees so this is a guess.
BIP38 is nice. Mycelium and Copay will ask for the password when you sweep a BIP38 encrypted QR code. The password can stop casual theft without being as high entropy as a brainwallet password, though I do use a pretty long phrase for mine.
It sounds like you have the idea. The main goal is to avoid leaking information when you create and store the paper wallets. Then fund each one once and hide them well. Do a few tests with small amounts on some of the wallets and then cross them off. You will leak your BIP38 password to your phone if you do that. Personally I'm fine with that. BIP38 is essentially a two factor setup IMHO.

1) encrypted paper wallets from bitaddress.org, generated and printed with all the necessary precautions. Also saved as pdf and text, zipped with bank and exchange records, encrypted again and uploaded.
2) Coinbase wallet. It's basically only good for sending coins to your real wallet. Fee calculation is high/terrible and it takes fees out of the total, which is really only good for sending money to yourself.
3) Three levels
1. Spending level: I'd recommend mycelium, electrum, and copay on android periodically refilled from paper wallets. Use at least two. To enhance privacy. To decrease the chance of an update screwing you out of funds without carrying seed words around. To keep your marital and (ahem) non-marital property seperate with less chance of fucking it up. You can have multiple wallets in a single program but that's human error waiting to happen. Divorce lawyers fuck around less than the IRS and both will soon have you paying for your own blockchain analysis. Maybe you don't like the IRS much, but I love them and usually pay double what I owe. xxo
2. Undeniable and customs-declarable cold storage. Paper wallets and seed words you can use to refill or restore your spending wallets. Keep amounts small so you don't fret too much about trusting convenient new wallets.... Also, if you lose your Trezor and see Trezors for sale around the corner, it would be tempting to buy - except your Trezor was actually stolen to make you buy.... a fake one. So keep enough small paper denominations to cover this. If you keep seed words as paper wallets (option I may use in the future) then keep some of those in small denominations too.
3. Deniable and transportable cold storage. The above, encrypted, innocently named, left out in the open and uploaded. Save paper wallets as pdf. Copy paste from pdf into a text file too. Use tar and gpg for bundling and encryption.
You buy bitcoin into either level 2 or 3 and then move them up to 1 as you need to spend. Paper wallets need to be printed securely from bitaddress.org (tutorials on this) or alternatively they could be generated as just text using bitcoin core cli if you don't trust bitaddress. Okay.. huge wall if text. But you must remember that the $10k investment you secure today will be worth $moon in a few years. You can fuck up and replace it now, but if you don't have 100% confidence in your system then you are going to have some sweaty palms in the future.

There certainly is more code between seed and key. With either approach I'm totally lost as to the optimal number of coins per wallet. By optimal I mean I want it small so that trust in future devices can be minimized (trust is expensive too). This is both trust in the device and trust in the merchant to not observe a big change address and follow me home. I want it large to minimize fees. So now I've gone with my smallest wallets containing 0.25 BTC and my largest containing 5 BTC. Most contain 1 BTC. I have no idea what an optimal size is because worth of BTC and fees are so uncertain now.

You trust your Trezor, sure, but when it dies and you need to restore on a new device, do you really want to type a seed worth 20,000 acres of Iowa farmland into some $100 shit you bought online? **Always break it up so you can restore/sweep your BTC in small amounts.**

Yes. With a smartphone you scan the code and get a password prompt if you encrypted the wallet. It's very nice.

You are 100% correct. But this is why bitcoin will succeed. Men's efforts have always included such ultimate folly. Our history of wars, corrupted governments, broken institutions, and fallible laws now includes bitcoin. It will be as much a part of our world as these other things. Bitcoin is not the way to paradise. It is a symptom of our greed and hostility toward each other, and as such it will flourish.

Yes. Except we don't know how LN will work out. It might be normal to open 1 or 2 payment channels per year with Paypal2 Corp. and just pay a $200 fee for each on-chain transacrion. The fee can't be so large that George the Plumber will be priced out though, otherwise LN will have failed. LN also depends on cheap on-chain transactions for its security, since closing out a channel is the threat that keeps people honest (AFACT). I wouldn't want to choose between someone holding my funds for ransom vs forcing the money out on the blockchain for $200, then paying $200 again to open a new channel. We don't know how this stuff will scale or what the fee structure will be.
Another thing to consider. 7 billion people. 21 million coins. 0.003 BTC per person ($3000 for a $1m coin). That would seem to force fees below 0.00005 (wild ass guess of $100 to open and close a channel) for widespread adoption. 
My smallest paper wallets are 0.25 BTC. I hate trusting things. If you're worried about fees you can import (rather than sweep) paper wallets. You can also use an HD wallet seed kind of like a paper wallet that you import.

My credit card transactions show up right away as "pending" but often these transactions are for incorrect amounts that will be magically fixed and authorizations.

And the average fee would be $90 at today's demand. But at that demand I assume there would be like 40 times more people in the market so... $3600 fee for a simple transaction?  I'm a little worried because I just split my wealth up into smaller addresses for privacy and security... Is 0.25 BTC too small now? My thinking was that it would be worth about $25k at some point, and that's enough for one address, to trust to a new Wallet, etc. But by my guess math above I'd be paying like 7% to 15% fees just to use it. What's the new dust level? Is it 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1?

It would take the blockchain just over one month to move 21 million BTC in 21 million simplest-possible 1 BTC transactions. There are 7 billion people, equating to 0.003 BTC per person. It would take 35 years to move all 21 million coins in simple transactions in per-capita amounts... 35 years to process each person. The current blockchain might be able to keep up with birth and death rate but that's it. Even with LN, how can a per capita holding of 0.003 be expected to pay ANY on-chain fees? And how can LN work with on-chain commits that happen every few decades per channel? Remember, there's only room for 1 commit every 35 years per person.
We need 256mb blocks + LN for bitcoin to be a global currency.

Money is divisible and transportable. Bitcoin, a kind of money (hence "coin"), is designed to be divisible (8 decimal places) and transportable (network). Fees hurt divisibilty and transportability. People who want to turn bitcoin into an asset are free to do so, of course, but then we should quit using "coin" in the name because that's just false advertising.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:22:33
A 0.001 BTC fee is 1% for a $1000 transaction for a $10k coin. We're nearly there... and since interest in bitcoin drives price as well as fees I don't think it's unreasonable to assume quadratic fee growth (in real terms). And that's on top of seemingly exponential growth in people entering the market.

LN is trustless. It is not necessarily decentralized. If it is centralized then it will not necessarily be anonymous either. So the only real guarantee is that it is trustless.

I'd rather have a seed worth 0.25 BTC that I could use for a bit, and then I'd prefer to load another worth 5 not 50. It's all gambling with trust, how the network will work, And future fees. I can make choices but they are anything but informed.

I do. The modern way would be to create multiple HD wallets and write down the words to essentially create paper wallets. Nice thing about that is that there are no fees to "restore". Most paper wallet utilities make you sweep the wallet even though it would fine just to import it. And with a paper wallet your key is probably going to be routed through a less secure device at some point during import so it may be safer to sweep it into an HD wallet anyway.

I don't know about you but 2 channels per year seems kinda low... and who would ever close their channel if the fees for doing so are so outrageous that it would be better to just get ripped off by a merchant inside LN? Can't we just take a small step toward bigger blocks, especially since LN will need them anyway in order to become truly global scale? 2mb is basically enough for everyone in the world to open and close a payment channel once during their career. It's a small step.

Seed words describe a set of addresses. Your seed contains change addresses so you can spend from it and retain all coins in the seed. A paper wallet can do the same but it's only one address so doing this with a paper wallet requires address reuse. I like paper wallets anyway for long term storage. And if I went the seed word route I'd still break up my coins into smaller chunks. I don't want to trust a new device with a seed worth more than I earn in a month.

I buy bitcoin not because I love it, but because I fear it. When you can't beat em, join em. Governments who fight will fail.

Unspent outputs have a heritage but all you can say is that it's 1% X, 20% Y, etc. You don't know how or why it's that way and you can't really split off the X. That's fungibility. It's like your bank account... 98% paycheck and 2% tax return but when you spend a dollar it's just a dollar, neither paycheck nor tax return.

Are there any altcoins where proof of work is equal to spamming the bitcoin blockchain?

What makes an investor unqualified? Do people own their money or not? This is a bitcoin forum, no?

Keep a hand written letter in a sealed envelope inside the safety deposit box. Address it to wife, children, etc. Write "Turn over the photo of me holding fish and bread. Then use password1234." Make sure the photo is glued into an album that you keep in a safe. On the back of the photo they'll find a several BIP38 encoded paper wallets of varying amounts.

Open your eyes, Brother. You gotta look, but not just anywhere. You're free to see but you cant just look around. You gotta look between the bars to see outside your cage. It's a state of mind, Man.

Yea, but the chains will most likely share the existing market cap so 50%/50% to 100%/0%. To double your money you could sell the loser before it goes to 0 and buy the winner before it goes to 100. I think one of the chains will keep it's value or go up and the clear loser will become an alt like litecoin. I'm just going to sit it out.
