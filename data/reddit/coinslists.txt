An arbiter is needed for the security, sanctity, and protection of the buyer - and insures that that buyer has the funds needed to complete the purchase - presenting a modicum of seller protection.
The best case scenario dictates that an arbiter does nothing.
The worst case scenario necessitates that an arbiter make a decision about appropriation of funds.
Excepting only the terms of multinational conglomerates that often require "third party arbitration" - having an arbiter is in everyone's best interests.

Most people are getting lulled to sleep by sweet sound of, "I don't give a f followed by, "Extra shot of corn syrup in my doughnut."
Conservatives think as long as they have enough cans of tuna, ammo, and a few AR's they will be okay. Sprinkle some Jesus on that, and we're golden.
Liberals think no matter what the government hands out, it's not enough.
Libertarians think if you can't afford the ammunition to go in your gun, then you deserve to starve to death since you can't hunt. 
People are too wrapped up in their own micro-issues to understand the bigger picture. Most people will agree once you show them some fact based truth.

The types of companies that are directly affected by the BitLicense are those in which users do not control their private keys. They secure funds for their customers. Exchanges. Brokers. Marketplaces. Coinbase. Circle. Bitreserve. BitQuick. CryptoThrift.
If you think a narcissistic dick hole in a suit in NY won't try to make a name for himself seizing the assets of anyone that can be compelled to do so; all in the name of consumer protection - you must have been under a rock for the past two decades.
I've asked several bitcoin companies how they feel about the BitLicense. The response is unanimous. The BitLicense is a major roadblock for startups that have the potential to disrupt the status quo.
Look for states that are "bank-strong" to enact similar and even more restrictive legislation in the near future. See North Carolina.

"You," was a euphemistic "you." I didn't mean to imply anything personal. We agree on most things. 
Bitreserve is in the UK. Most of Bitreserve's holdings are from US customers if I'm not mistaken. The same could be said for a lot of off shore bitcoin companies. BitQuick has US, India, and Taiwan facing sites, with the US being the largest by far with regards to volume.

Give bitreserve a ring, and you can hold your new found coins at their current value while you figure out a way to get real life money. Coinbase is another option.

The people that build products around bitcoin, those that support the network, and those that use bitcoin have the opinions that matter most.
Both sides of this argument are valid. The miners will vote on any changes made. It's unfortunate that mining got exclusive so quickly. This problem manifested as a result of bitcoin's success. Careful decisions will need to be made by the people that have the power to make them.

Bitcoin doesn't offer much buyer protection out of the box. Once a payment is sent, it's gone. 
Bitcoin is a dream come true for sellers other than sometimes buyers sometime don't want to transact without the traditional protections. The only way a buyer will get a refund is if you administer it as the seller.
Fraudulent orders are a non-issue for the seller. Fill your orders as usual and accept payment without fear. I'd worry more about the credit card side that presents much greater fraud risk to you as the seller.

It's a huge step. 
The risk must be accepted by both consumer and merchant if bitcoin isn't converted to fiat via a payment processor. Tools exist today to mitigate this risk without a payment processor. 
Once these tools are incorporated into an all in one wallet - watch the F'k out!
At least with a bitcoin wallet, merchants don't have to wait 21 days to access their funds. This goes without mentioning the chargeback risk that comes with accepting PayPal.

I can't tell you how many times I've been awarded what I paid for prior to a transaction being included in a block. Gyft, Fold, and Bitrefill all typically give the user what they paid for before the transaction is confirmed.
I get what you are saying though. Usually you have to wait for several confirmations before spending any recently acquired coins.
Thanks you for helping us fine tune our content.

It’s a precarious situation.
 
Mining is becoming more consolidated and has a nebulous history at best. Increasing the block size before the actual use of the network needs it poses more questions than it does answers for some. Increasing the block size is still perceived as a need.
Why do we need an increase in block size now? Who would benefit from an increase in block size? Does the current adoption rate justify an increase in the resource requirements to actively participate in the economy?
Wasn’t bitcoin supposed to facilitate peer to peer transactions? When most of us think peer to peer, we aren’t thinking major institutional transfers of value, selling houses, or even cars. We are thinking smaller transactions more along the lines of a typical eBay or Craigslist event. Aren’t we?
The other side of the argument is that increasing the block size will help novel use cases develop more fruitfully. BitPay, Coinbase, Circle, ChangeTip, and even Bitreserve exist partially because mining has moved from basements to data centers located where electricity is cheap and excess heat is desired. Off-chain transactions would be useless otherwise.
During the short time that common people have paid attention to bitcoin, mining bitcoin has gone from a hobbyist endeavor to an industry rife with controversy. Do we really want it to get more exclusive than it already is? Could further consolidating mining increase the friction of peer to peer transactions?
Block size obviously needs to increase. How much, and when is to be determined. Gavin’s proposal has merit. However, both good and bad ideas tend to have some merit.
 
In the interim, 20MB doesn’t seem like a lot from the outside looking in. From the inside it may look like a gravy train.
If this is going to happen, the parties that make the decisions – the miners – should consider the consequences thoroughly. The proof will be in the pudding as they say.

Artist should claim their work that isn't contracted by shysters. Ascribe.io comes to mind. This way only distributors (Spotify, Pandora, et al) can shaft the artist, but not without a plain language agreement with fair compensation.
The artists and content creators are shafting themselves by selling themselves short when they sign crappy contracts. The tools for self publishing, self promoting, and self monetizing are readily available. 
Most don't need an attorney to understand the terms of services that are freely available to everyone.
Artist need to save themselves. Neither bitcoin nor any other tech is going to save them without intent and effort from the artists.

This is something many of **us** might be willing to do. We might even convince our significant others and children to join in our adventure.
This is not a big sell for average travelers that leave their homes with more than a backpack and a smartphone. New bitcoiners are not savvy enough to navigate Mycelium or LBC to make a quality vacation happen.
Travel is all about moving freely and with minimal friction. 
Reducing this friction starts at home. If your local spots don't accept bitcoin in some way - Stripe, Bitpay, etc, don't expect a foreign land to be any more friendly. 
Start making your immediate surroundings more bitcoin friendly before leaving home with nothing more than bitcoin in your pocket.

The ~~1200~~ **600ish** pump started on gox because people couldn't get fiat off the exchange. Bitcoin was bought on gox so that individuals could remain liquid. The other exchanges still followed gox's lead at the time. 
We have been returning to earth ever since. What's happening is not a "good" or a "bad" thing. It is a natural thing.

Using ChangeTip for marketing and feedback is good idea. Integrating ChangeTip into Fold as a way to buy someone else $10 worth of coffee for $8 worth of bitcoin takes it to the next level. 
Reach out to relevant media and even small time bloggers. Every mention can grow your brand.

I didn't realize you gave change back in bitcoin. That's a pretty sweet deal. Like others, I'm interested how this is feasible with a 20% discount. Given the history of Brawker and Purse, skeptics might think they'd be participating in credit card fraud. 
We are always looking for novel use cases for bitcoin to write about. Fold definitely fits the type of application we'd like to feature. Someone will be extensively testing this application in the coming weeks.
Don't give up, be honest, and treat yourself right.

Paying with a barcode scan via mobile phone is fairly common at Starbucks. Gyft Starbucks cards require a quick scan of the phone, but only offer a 3% closed loop reward when purchased with bitcoin. The 20% discount and bitcoin refund option from Fold might be enough to convince some folks to accelerate their quest for Type 2 diabetes.

The trial would have been very damaging to the state. Any trial without calling Ulbricht to the stand would have been an overtly kangaroo court. The state has no intentions of bolstering Ulbricht's appeal. 
I'm sure whatever deal the Secret Service agent gets is in line with the amount of face the state saved. I wouldn't be surprised with 18 months and zero time spent in the general population. 
Edit: It's funny how we nonchalantly fail to state the Secret Service agent's name or DEA agent's name in this case. The United States Secret Service agent's name, *who betrayed his oaths and his country,* is [**Shaun W. Bridges**, 32, of Laurel, Md.]( The DEA agent's name that *also plead out and betrayed his oaths and his country,* is [**Carl Mark Force IV**]( also from Maryland. 
Edit 2: It is my experience that anyone with a suffix ≥ "Jr." is inevitably a douche bag that believes their name is as good as currency.

I realized that I misspoke when I woke up this morning. A $20 transaction performed on the PayPal network would net about $19.12 (2.9% + $0.30). $16 is only a 16.3% discount from the merchant's perspective. It's still a 20% win for the consumer. A few "item not as described" disputes and charge backs could easily push the PayPal net down - along with increasing the seller's blood pressure. 
I think **mainstream consumers** would be thrilled to get 20% off of something they are going to buy anyways. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:42:18
I absolutely love hearing this. Adapt or die. 
When merchants and vendors figure out that they can absolutely save money by accepting bitcoin, adoption will follow. 
I'm working on a model for a niche market right now that accepts credit/debit cards and bitcoin. Bitcoin prices are 20% cheaper. The model requires high margins to succeed, but I'd much rather have $16 sent to my Bitreserve dollar account than have $20 sent to my PayPal account. 
I've owned several businesses. Merchant fees / accounts for credit cards are a big leak and often a big headache. PayPal is even worse. 
Once bitcoin settles its immature ass down; it will be something to behold. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 04:56:24
Agreed. My moral compass leads me to hold people in positions of power to a higher standard. 
If the standard necessitates that Ulbricht get life in prison, then a standard higher than that should be applied to those that participated in the investigation that led to his arrest. 
My tax dollars didn't fund the Silk Road. At least a few satoshis funded these agents' salaries and benefits.
For the record; the standard is fucking stupid.
@_date: 2015-09-01 04:28:10
I understand the downvotes - it wasn't me - but this statement is spot on except one tiny little detail. 
Shaun W. Bridges and Carl Mark Force IV probably inflicted more violence on people than most of the people they helped arrest. 
They were given weapons and power by those in power and were sworn to protect us from ourselves. Their crimes are greater than the crimes of those which they helped arrest and deserve greater punishments.

It doesn't matter. The state made their case while suppressing defense testimony and concealing evidence from the jurors' purview.
