Do not purchase from this site, it's very suspicious, and they're using a wordpress theme that's not even complete and it has placeholder text. + no bitcoin checkout option
@_date: 2016-10-08 02:14:13
Scam, do not use this site, they will scam you.

CoinGateway was launched roughly around the same time as ShapeShift.
Even though they might seem similar at first, the 2 services are very different from each other.
In addition to the launch of the new CoinGateway platform, we have been progressing forward on a new all encompassing fully featured trading platform.
This trade platform will embrace all the current needs traders desire, but will also feature a primary distinguishing feature that we are confident will make it a front-runner in the crypto-trading space.
Please keep watching us for more information on the release of this revolutionary product!
