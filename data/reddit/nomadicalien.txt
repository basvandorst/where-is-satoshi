the fact he trolls so good makes me kind of lean towards wanting to believe he is the real satoshi.. either way both satoshis are great

Don't regret~ I had the same thing happen to me and didn't invest too much (looking back of course I should have, but btc will go to moon so even a small amount is plenty ;) 
Even now older people just don't really understand, it's ok though, everyone here helps move towards a brighter future.

please take a look at fiatleak, i dont understand why people think china is not out, they are buying all the coins
@_date: 2014-03-15 13:03:42
I thought the same thing, perhaps if someone who is a resident of the boulevard could 'manage' the atm it could be crowdfunded
I'd be interested in participating in part ownership

2016 will be a good year hopefully!

There will be coming something like this. PAX, pegged asset exchange, and it will be completely decentralized, pegging to various currencies etc.

Except that bitcoin takes a long time to confirm a transaction. Bitcoin is better as a store of value, or making large purchases, then actually paying for things like coffee, or a taxi ride.

BitcoinDark will soon have PAX which allows users to lock funds to USD among other things.

InstantDEX is a trading engine 
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:35:29
When you trade on a centralized exchange, your trading a promise to pay BTC when you withdraw your btc.
mgwBTC, or superBTC is no different than that promise to pay when you request a withdrawl to your BTC wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:11:57
Yes, yes.
@_date: 2015-08-06 01:24:59
You would use your api key, and then it uses that locally.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:04:19
InstantDEX will enable near real-time trading between cryptocurrencies. The goal of InstantDEX is to provide a fully decentralized peer-to-peer realtime trustless trading environment. Trades are done directly between peers, the blockchain is used to record such trades.
InstantDEX will generate revenues by charging 0.1% to 0.2% of transactions. InstantDEX will let people change their bid/ask without fees and only charge when a trade happens. Since we wont have large server expenses no matter how many active traders there are, our overhead will be the lowest in the industry. It combines orderbooks from different exchanges into a single orderbook, so you can pay the lowest possible price.
It is meant to be an easy to use tool for both advance and new users. It can automate exchange and deposit between crypto-currencies for new comers through the use of vanilla tradebots, as well as allow NY stock exchange level complex trades, all under the same platform.
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:53:15
Trading mgwBTC or superBTC is decentralized already vs NXT, on NXT Asset Exchange, and also will be on InstantDEX, with arbitrage opportunities across all the existing exchanges. 
Holding superBTC or mgwBTC in the superNET wallet is semi-decentralized (3 servers) in the Multigateway right now. But you can withdraw to your personal BTC wallet after your done trading.
If you don't want to use it that's fine, other people will use it as a tool to make money.
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:40:51
It sounds similair to 
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:18:18
They don't need to use bitcoin to use a blockchain. They can just make thier own blockchain...

if your in canada Cavirtex is highly recommended

Do you want to buy stuff? save them?
@_date: 2013-04-24 08:49:47
This is a sample I made recently which I thought turned out pretty ok.
There are some imperfections, with a few more iterations I should be able to get them pretty clean.
This one right now is the same size of a cc and made from pla.
Was wondering what you guys think? Any suggestions or feedback is welcomed.
@_date: 2013-07-06 14:44:47
anything butt-erfly isn't suprising to me
@_date: 2013-08-27 10:58:33
i had responded to the emails, and got responses, then eventualy they let me know when it was ready and the funds appeared in the bitcoin24 account, and had a withdrawl button
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:19:30
maybe fork bitcoin and have all miners agree to not accept anything from 'satoshis (nsa's) addresses, 
tldr: all nsa coins get set to not existing yet, and new mining frenzy begins
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:27:29
good idea, although i didn't include qr on this one since ive tried printing qr codes, and simply without multiple colours it's not very easy to do (qr's have freestanding pixels kind of like the ''inner parts of the B or O" which make it difficult to be read without using 2 colours. Hopefully later when i save up some more I'll buy/build parts i need to do it
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:21:07
ok thanks! i will try this
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:11:31
I just noticed they removed 2.59 btc from my account as an inactivity fee on oct 31st, i've opened a support ticket with them just now
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:51:08
buy more
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:05:42
why invest it all in altcoins ?
@_date: 2013-08-07 08:42:51
my 2 cents,
It doesn't matter who you think is the 'least' likely to steal...
When someone steals, they do it because they thought they have a high chance of getting away with it. 
I'm sorry it happened to you, but take this as a learning experience.
And by the way, 10 character password numbers/letters isn't really high strength.. you should have double or more than that, and some special characters doesn't hurt.
I would NOT put big sums in an online wallet.. Just use an online wallet ( if you want to use one) as a spending wallet, just put a couple btc in it, unless you had something you want to buy for 30 btc. You said you used blockchain for 'easier transactions', yes.. it also makes it 'easier' for people to transact other's funds as well.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:55:07
What did you mean by resolve ?
Ya It could be done painting or marker something like that perhaps, but if I want to make more qr codes then I should probably build a dual extruder, but right now I have alot of other stuff on the go.

you could also just back up the google key when you make the 2 way encryption. back it up on paper, save it where you have your passport or in a safe, if your phone get's lost/stolen, you can always use the paper backup to load into a new phone with the authenticator (it can't hurt to do it manually, you can add identical keys in the phone authenticator, and it'll prove to yourself that you can recover it from the paper no problem)

"For these paranoid folks, Bitcoin seems a dream come true – a way to conduct their finances totally outside the peering eyes of Uncle Sam. Drug dealers and criminals love Bitcoin for the same reason."
everything's fine, harper's looking out for you man, same with the banks, no corruption here, why so paranoid?

I'm in the process of dealing with cavirtex in restoring funds which it has wrongly removed from me in it's entirety, applying it's newly created fee policy, to inactivity prior to the existance of this policy.
And it does not state that it will apply this policy to historical inactivity period.

yes that is correct, 
The following is complete nonsense:
"Even if the FBI is not able to transfer the money, merely having possession of the wallet file itself is enough to prevent the coins being spent."

You seem clearly not part of the target audience that OP directed towards, he's looking for people who are likeminded, ''believe in bitcoin".
OP is trying to initiate some kind of collaboration, not of the kind of collaboration which you outputted, hence people downtrolling you.
 If your a gov regulator, or one of those other occupations you mentioned, then OP's post was not targetted to you.
