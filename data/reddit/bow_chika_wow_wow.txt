Well remember that your loan was paid off by some others who made losses. You can deny all you want, but cryptocurrency at the current state is a Ponzi, and the time when you can't find more idiots who would pay more than you did, the Ponzi scheme will end and many will be holding bags.

Sorry but a lot of people I know of in Asia day trade: they try to profit by winning the charts. If Bitcoin crashes, these are the people who would bail out almost immediately.

It is okay to deter average income people from making low fee transactions but okay to deter them from running a Bitcoin node? What the hell is wrong with you people.

Don't thank bitcoin. Thank some idiot who bought bitcoin more expensive than you did.

If you look at individual independent observations, yes that's what you get. That doesn't mean that your birth is a total miracle; chance that you or some of your siblings could have born is much MUCH higher than that due to number of trials (number of sperm cells). In the case of the hash, the chance that "ec" and "148" coincides with the respective forked hashes is actually mind-blowing because this is the first time a fork happened in bitcoin and it will probably remain so for some long time. The number of trial is essentially limited to 1 in this case. For reference, that chance is around winning a 4+ Powerball ($50,000) at one-shot. Not a miniscule chance, but still mind-boggling!

But you can fucking do that already with traditional databases!! There’s a reason why we don’t do or have what you said, because what we have is *enough* for what it is. There is not a pinch of value blockchain can offer in any common uses you can think of.

This didn’t age well.

LOL, that's the problem with you buttcoiners mate. You have no fucking idea the underlying technologies yet you just yell 'BLOCKCHAIN!' in hopes of recruiting more bagholders like yourself and getting a lambo some day. 
Let me be straight with you. Yes, tokenization allows fractional shares. And guess what? SO DOES TRADITIONAL DATABASES. You just need to update the database architecture, which 
**probably is going to take much less development, adoption AND maintenance cost than let's say... blockchain tokenization**! BTW, traditional relational databases are completely packed with security and transanctional features due to 5 decades of database researches, so no fucking sane engineer will ever consider blockchain to store information as critical in BOTH security AND efficiency as securities. Even cryptocurrency exchanges use relational databases for internal trading processing purposes.
The only question that needs to be answered for considering employing blockchain is "does the application need a database that require concurrent read AND write by multiple trustless parties?". For stock/security exchange storage? Usually that answer is a strong no, even for stocks. So, since you asked 


The answer is a strong no as well. You buttcoiners/scammers/bagholders deserve no mercy.

Yeah duh. Have you heard of Buttcoin and comedy mining? It's next greatest tech there is, so be sure to sell all your life savings, 401k, houses and whatnot before it MOOONS and you miss the train!!!

BS. Check out the post in [June 7]( The comment was even removed back then. It cannot be an edit at least. One possibility is that someone has tampered with the screenshot. Until then we can rule out foul play by editing post-events. You should ask yourself if you are before accusing others of the same.
Edit: I just checked [removeddit]( and it seems like the part about Epstein was not there 4 months ago (May). The comment was edited to mention the Epstein incident but removed later, all happening between May and June 7,
Edit 2: I used this [forensic tool]( that any idiot can use to see if there are any anomalies in the [screenshot]( that is left as the only evidence of the comment. All analysis show no signs tampering. This is getting scary.

You sound very very sick. Just like the other guy.
