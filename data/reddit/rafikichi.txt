Actually, BitShares has brought us to the brink of a decentralized fiat and Bitcoin exchange with the advent of the bitUSD deriviative backed 2x by BitSharesX margins.

I agree with good Samaritan philosophy.  He could have destroyed bitcoin's price today!

Make a paper wallet with someone else's giant balance as the public key and a non-matching encrypted private key.   Then you can even pretend to be in possession of it. HAHAHA!

Same creators.  DarkMarket was designed by DarkWallet team and then forked and developed as OpenBazaar.

Threaten the payment processor to cover the fraud that is caused by their shitty system and if that doesn't work, drop credit card processing.

Henry Hazlitt, Rothbard, and Mises are my economists and they don't have blogs.  It is a joy following their teachings since they come from the perspective of *individual actions and natural trade before government intervention*, rather than the Keynes *government intervention influencing individual actions and trade* approach.  
Please explain why Bitcoin isn't a proper currency when it meets all qualifications of money and currency with better efficiency than any other system used on Earth?  I hope it doesn't have something to do with the inability of government to control it and introduce the inflation tax on citizens...

I have burdened a few professors with my presence.  If you have a stable unit of account that is infinitely divisible (BTC), why must it grow in total units to accommodate an economy when falling prices will encourage savings and growth without your called-for increase in total money units?  When economies of scale and scope along with cheaper consumer prices are realized, this leads to greater savings, then greater production.  No monetary expansion needed.

Sanity, why does government force need to be involved to augment the aggregate of individual trades and transactions?  How can government force be used morally, objectively, honestly to over-ride the free economic choices of millions of individuals?  Why do you advocate this government-supreme approach?

Don't worry, ZeroHedge is logical. They won't have any choice but give in to the force of Bitcoin.  The ECB report vindicates Bitcoin as a currency and payment system.  They are scared and can't do shit about it.

It is not an economic fact nor law that a currency supply must grow with an economy.  This growing of the currency supply in relation to, or faster than, the growth of production in an economy is exactly what causes the misallocation of resources and credit, leading to natural economic corrections.  Your comment is from a government-school textbook.  When you study natural economics, you will find a giant enlightening gap between the voodoo establishment crap that created a great financial storm.  Bitcoin is neat for being the first active functioning example of a deflationary currency.  Austrian School will be vindicated if Bitcoin succeeds.

In early 2013 it went from $250 to $60.  Just a minor 80% crash.

I recommend you avoid Western Union transfers.   You are mislabelling what is actually insane.
