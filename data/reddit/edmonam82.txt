I was using the app and after the update it changed to this Hospital profile. It was using some other profile more like an exchange name before. So I stopped using the app till things get more clear:)

No fiat in crypto cafe please ��
Prices should be in Btc if that’s a true crypto oriented cafe ��
Also there is another hidden story behind this: at the end of the day the only crypto that stays is bitcoin all the alts were gone ��

Bitcoin has a value because it has a demand. No demand - no value (the rule works not only for bitcoin but for anything else). Why is it that bitcoin is growing in value? Simple answer: we have growing demand for a new form of money that is acceptable worldwide, is secure and trusted by people. It’s not possible to duplicate it and it supply is limited. That’s why it’s compared to gold. It’s not a way to get rich quick as most people look at it. Its a technology of storing and exchanging value online. It’s not centralized and governed by any authority. Value is the demand. 2018 will be yet another year with crazy rising demands. We all need a change and it’s coming...banks are old and will get older even faster because of bitcoin ✌️

But don’t they lose more paying those fees rather than getting back more from mining? ��

HODL!!! ��

Wouldn’t recommend a hardware wallet for newbies. Just take a look at this recent article.

Use craigslist

It’s about the adoption of the LN not about the implementation on the core. So imo we’ll see it coming quietly until it’s in the news ��
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:59:09
Binance Coin will go up again imo.

It’s just the price moving up and down. It’s always going to go higher on the long run. History proved it. It’s the technology behind the bitcoin that matters. That’s the real thing. Bitcoin speculations will always be there but it has nothing to do with the future financial ecosystem that’s slowly constructing itself from the bitcoin’s revolutionary nature. The future is slowly coming in. Stop the FUD. If you’re like refreshing the coinmarketcap’s webpage more than your facebook page than you’ll be like an old man with all white hair in a year. Patience always pays back. ��

Wow, wtf ��
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:29:10
Sell it on Ebay ��

@_date: 2018-01-10 09:46:31
You’re right. I think Steemit is the future FB. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:45:33
You don’t wanna go there til bitcoin hits a new all time high ��

That was about this - Feel sorry for the people paying 2-4K for an account
Sorry I’m new to Reddit:)

I think they just want to wait for the marketcap to  get out of the dip before they open the ico:)
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:59:23
Don’t you think it’s a little bit late to invest in bitconnect?��
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:31:35
Yeah selling the dip is the smartest thing to do ��
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:47:44
Profitability isn’t the case here. It’s just about the pleasure of mining ��
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:45:28
Best market prediction so far. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:42:03
Make a Tether t-shirt ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:14:45
Don’t worry. Just forget about it for a couple of days. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:39:19
True!
