Why do u say this
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:26:48
why is the price on coinbase 1000 more than the price on kraken?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:46:27
Why are all.the cryptos down?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:59:28
Yeah how does one even buy ripple if I have all the coins and cash on coinbase?
Also missed that 50% gain already anyway
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:56:55
Um. Yes we aren't as advanced in our cryptos knowledge. Can you explain why you say this
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:54
So.basically coinbase is allowing sending to and from, but not buy sell. 
How long does sending take?

Be like lingfin, make up a coin, artificially peg it to eth, lemd it out. Buy your own server that is incorporated . Profit billions. (This actually happened)

You panic biugh 100k? You're okay
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:58
What is going on bch to 8500 then down but not tradable?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:20:10
Fuck coinbase. Still failed to verify my account. I sold the limit before the 4 coins totally crashed. Wanted to buy a ton at 11k/500/200 but I didn't because I wouldn't be able to sell in case if more problems.
Now we're back. Missed that bug run up.bc fuck coinbase
Where should I send my coins
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:48:46
Why are all of the 4 main coins down (well BTC bch eth ltc)
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:09:45
Um yeah, I met my sell limit and can't sell anymore. I submitted I'd for verification but it hasn't been completed yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:57:35
