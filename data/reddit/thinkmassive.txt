How did you plan to confirm the transaction quickly enough to be reasonable for a POS system?
Waiting up to 20 minutes when placing an order online is a minor inconvenience, but I can't see how it would work in person. There must be solutions to this that I'm unaware of.

**Hardware:** RPi 3B+, ATP aMLC 4GB, Samsung T5 SSD 500GB, wifi hotspot, battery
**Software:** Raspbian Lite, Tor, bitcoind, lnd, electrum-personal-server, [RTL]( [LNDash](
I built this mobile node using the excellent [RaspiBolt guide by Stadicus]( Using tor makes it easy to change wifi networks with minimal disruption, so it's easy to take this node with me for live demos. Last night I successfully [demoed it at Bitcoin &amp; Beer]( @ Denver Beer Co!
Overnight I tested an Anker 20100mAh battery: 19 hours uptime @ 25% remaining, so the whole setup averages 2.9 watts. Today I got a [PiJuice]( in the mail, which acts as a UPS that can be recharged from various sources including wall chargers, solar panel, and other batteries.

Thanks, and good luck with your build as well!
you just need to omit the &lt;&gt; like this:

it will take 2-3 weeks though

Haha thanks, I like it too but can't take credit for it. That's Stadicus' RaspiBolt Guide that I included on the screen to give him attribution: 
The small floating logo is from [LightningPowerUsers.com]( who are trying to make it easy to onboard new nodes, and it's where I established my first long-lived channel.

24-hour BTC volume equivalent is listed at the bottom of the front page. Find-in-page for "DAY_STATISTICS". It looks like the counter frequently gets stuck for days or months at a time (possibly a scraping issue), but we can get a general idea...
* Dec 28, 2017: 1889 BTC ([archive.org]( - highest volume I saw
* May 1, 2018: 1229 BTC ([archive.org](
* May 6, 2018: 1041 BTC ([archive.org](
* May 9, 2018: 770 BTC ([archive.org](
* Jun 4, 2018: 204 BTC ([archive.org]( (looks like it's stuck here for the rest of 2018)
* Sep 4, 2018: KYC announced
* Oct 1, 2018: KYC enforced for web UI
* Oct 20, 2018 KYC enforced for API (according to forums)
* Jan 9, 2018: 53 BTC
I've been checking periodically, and for the past month it's been between 25-60 BTC. Keep in mind this is BTC volume that's down 80-98% and doesn't even take into account USD equivalent.

RaspiBlitz is basically an attempt to automate the RaspiBolt guide using shell scripts. I tried it out, but I hit enough issues that it was actually easier to manually perform all the steps from Stadicus' guide instead:
There are much better automation tools available, so I recommend doing the process manually and then automating it yourself. If that sounds unappealing then you might be better off using a pre-built solution.
 
The RaspiBolt **Mainnet** section covers copying data from another computer. I highly recommend using testnet until you're comfortable with it, especially if you don't have a lot of prior experience running blockchain infrastructure on Linux.
