If prices for bitcoin are inflated in the countries receiving remittences, then there is even *greater* reason to use bitcoin.  The recipient can sell them for *more* than the sender paid for them.
@_date: 2014-09-21 07:06:26
Yeah, I think the best option would be to have a 'stock split' for Bitcoin, so that bits become bitcoins.  Second best would be to simply use bits for everything (and forget millibitcoins - that's too messy).

Did I say that?  No, I didn't.  I said it's his *own reputation* that he's ruined.  But a lot of a lot of people *are* losing a of a lot of confidence in Bitcoin because of him.  And other reasons too, of course.

About 6,000.  Yeah.
@_date: 2016-03-14 02:25:25
Well, Thermos had to wait for either the value of bitcoin to skyrocket, so he could spend a tiny fraction of his dragon's hoard of donations and still claim he was spending the full amount; or then wait for the value of bitcoin to die off completely, so he'd have an excuse not to spend anything at all, since it was worthless anyway.

@_date: 2016-03-10 05:04:59
Yes they are, they're preventing it from growing in the way that had been envisioned, and turning it into something else by hindering innovation.
@_date: 2016-03-10 05:15:52
You harm it the same way you harm a plant that you don't re-pot after its roots have filled its pot.
@_date: 2016-03-13 02:41:03


And yet it is one.  You really think those piddling efforts even remotely justify the donations?


@_date: 2016-03-13 02:02:26
Yeah, but other crypto currency bubbles haven't involved a big change in the functioning of the Bitcoin network.  And this rally is for an alt that presents a solution to the problems Bitcoin is having.  
Also, its main online communities aren't having their discussion censored.  A cryptocurrency's social network is every bit as much a part of it as the software is.  If you damage the social network, you harm the health of the currency.
And there might just be a bubble riding on an underlying shift.  There could be a large collapse coming up (I'm thinking in about a month or so, when this big Bitcoin pennant comes to a close), but the ETH market might shrug it off and just keep working its way back up.  As the buzz draws more people in, more people become more familiar with the world computer that Vitalik has invented, something wildly different from previous cryptos.  I may not be completely comfortable with everything about Eth, but I can't deny its ingenuity.
Mind you, I'm not shilling for one currency or the other.  I'm mostly in Bitcoin, but I've hedged my bets with the other one.  So I'm actually pretty impartial, since I'll have a healthy stake in whichever one takes precedence (assuming nothing else comes along), but my stake in the losing side will die as well.
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:44:46

They *are* effectively forking the protocol by preventing it from growing as per Satoshi's intention.
@_date: 2016-03-13 12:14:24
Nah, I kind of didn't.  Making people lose confidence in Bitcoin is not the same as *ruining my* confidence in Bitcoin.  Yes, he has made me lose a lot of confidence in Bitcoin, but not all of it, so it isn't actually ruined.

Thanks, I have.


People donated to him for a stated purpose (to improve the forum).  He didn't do that, and just kept the BTC.  Therefore he is a scammer.
@_date: 2016-03-14 02:35:26


Wrong.  No dollars *at all* were donated - people donated *bitcoin only*.  But you had to wait for the value to skyrocket or die off completely, so you'd have an excuse to either spend a tiny fraction of it and claim to be spending the full value of the donations (and even that I highly doubt), or then spend nothing at all since the donated bitcoin were worthless anyway.

But Bitcoin was *designed* to be forked.  Bitcoin is defined as the longest chain, it's not about whether or not it's a fork (or a fork of a fork of a fork).
@_date: 2016-03-12 23:15:55
You're assuming there will *be* an ETH crash, and while you may well be right, it's certainly not guaranteed.  Perhaps capital is just leaking because has Bitcoin has developed an evolutionary failure (unlike during other alt pumps), and that until that's corrected, it will continue to leak.
@_date: 2016-03-10 01:24:59

Eat my shit, cunt.  You're talking to everybody who reads this thread.  Don't like it?  Then stick to sending PM's.

Show me some proper grammar.  I'm sick of having to read posts 3 times to figure out what they mean.

Yes it was.  It's been reapproved now, but since it's 15 hours old with only 12 upvotes, you've got to go down 5 pages in this sub to find it, most conveniently.  (Notice how the majority of the comments are 15 hours old?)

Yes, it *was* removed.  And then it was reapproved much later, after it no longer posed any threat of getting attention.

What's wrong with a chain split?  It just means everyone who currently hodls gets two currencies.

OP posted this submission on both subreddits.  This sub is the one that removed it.  Yeah.
