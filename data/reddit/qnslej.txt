Yeah at the face of it they seem favorable...or reasonable would be a better world probably. The government at least so far don't seem to have a problem. London is still a very big deal to the world and they so desperately want things to stay that way, so the potential for new businesses finding their homes here is not something they want to squander, especially not before they know what on earth this bitcoin thing is really about.
It's the banks - which are private organisations, that simply tell you to fuck off if you run a bitcoin business. Unfortunately they are perfectly entitled to do so. I've had two different bank accounts shut down for selling on localbitcoins.com. They don't even give you a reason, just a letter saying "We have decided to stop doing business with you and therefore you are no longer our customer. You have x amount of days to transfer your money elsewhere". I'm paraphrasing but it's basically along those lines - blunt, no reason provided let alone a justification of their thought process behind that reasoning. I only have one bank account left now, and that bank is called First direct. They seem pretty cool but I'm sure they would be equally hostile if I were to make the same mistake with them. Actually I'm doubly sure of it because they are in fact just another division of HSBC. LOL.
