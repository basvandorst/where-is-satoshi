live dj's kinda... you can use soundcloud or youtube to play music.. plug.dj is limited that way, only way for live real dj's is to use icecast2 where you connect your dj software to the dj link then a dj can actually mix and spin custom music but no one was interested in that idea...

"50BTC has covered all losses" No they have not, I have been submitting support tickets for months.. Even sent them all pertinent information as to my account, proof of mining hardware etc.  Still Being led on by support saying we are working as fast as possible, to resolve this.  I even offered them to just pay back the BTC Value in USD at time of the Hack... I can't be any more lenient or patient with them...

i think everyone is missing the point... bitcoin was meant to be anonymous and btc-e has the best track record by far, and their keeping the spirit of bitcoins original design by staying anonymous... why trust an exchange who requires all your info they can run off with everything just like gox did, and they have all your info to identity theft your ass as well... Don't spread fud, when there is no dirt to spread.  This is an obvious post by some shill to try and steal users fro btc-e to another exchange because they can't get any of their own...

if this happened is the usa.  then the principal has the right.  at a public school and more so in private schools you have no rights.  now if your parents talk to the principal ans he does not comply for any reason, get your friend to check the address to see if the principal took the btc, if he did then his arse belongs to you!
