Then shouldn't Bitcoin.org host all possible consensus-compliant clients? including even MP's client (TRB).

Hi, I've been reading about tmsr and the whole thing lately. Since you seem to be in the know and more approachable than the guys on IRC, I always wanted to ask some questions on segwit, trb client etc:
-If segwit is such an huge attack vector, how come all of the smartest people in Core all agreed on it? Are all of them this stupid? because I don't believe it. What's going on there? I've always been insanely confused about this since then.. Eric Lombrozo... (I could go on for days) are all of them wrong? As a holder im worried and I need answers.
-When is it estimated that this hypothetical attack that would consist on miners colluding to steal BTC sitting on segwit addresses or something along the lines, would happen? I've read that it's just a matter of time. Once miners see an incentive to do so because there are tons of BTC sitting on segwit addresses, they would do it. This is honestly insane and I hope I can get some answers.
-What can one do to protect against such an attack? I have considered running a trb node but I have no idea about it yet. Does it have a GUI? Is it to be used as a wallet too? How do you guys use your bitcoins if you only use the trb node to transact but not as a wallet? A dedicated airgapped laptop and then another laptop running a trb node perhaps? (I still don't know how to deal with that so I would need to learn it somehow)
-What does trb do to protect against this hypothetical segwit attack? Wouldn't I be just as safe using Core, but just not accepting any segwit transactions? In case I accept a segwit transaction, if I move it into a legacy format address (the ones that begin with 1) would these BTC be safe?
-Is the HD format in Core introduced in around 0.13 considered safe or does it have any problems?
-On scaling... can fees grow forever? When would tmsr consider fees too high for bitcoin to be practical and what would be done about that?
-What is being done to stop the 2x mess? (well, don't reveal any plans, I just want to know if something is being done). Can I be calm about this? this 2x seems like a bigger deal than previous iterations. I would like to help with dumping, problem is im scared of losing my BTC in the process due replay attacks and whatnot (which is part of their attack, to not let the market decide properly and put it all on miner's hands)
thanks.
