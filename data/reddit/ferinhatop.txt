but it usually works like this, isn't? The standard market goes down, the crypto market goes up, and vice-versa.

i went to sleep and bitcoin was R$ 47000 (brasilian reais) in the exchange i use. Wake up and see and its now R$ 51500 (a grownth of about 9 % in a nigth). I would like to known what is goint on as well....is this a pump? Is this an effect of trump screwing up with the global economy? Is this a new parabolic uptrend?

i have a little money invested in cryptocurrency and all of it is stored at this exchange that i use since 2014 (one of the major exchanges here in brazil) and never had any issues with them, since they have very tight security (2 form factor, selfie for user validation, and a few others i don't recall very well). Never bothered to have my coins stored at a wallet since it is only a few and i fear that i might ended doing a ooopsie when transfering the responsability of its security from them to me. Since i'm daytrading and keep selling and buying coins frequently, hodling only a few, should i have a wallet and store it there? Or can i still trust the exchange, since i have more fiat with them than crypt?
