Ah I did miss a phrase, I meant to say `many coinbase users keep "their" crypto on the exchange`. So even if 30 million people opened an account on coinbase, and some portion bought crypto, many of that portion never actually got a personal wallet (so the 30 million coinbase accounts vs 40 million wallets on the blockchain comparison is just tough to relate).

I didn’t mean to imply it’s a holy grail. I just meant it prevents [some] top-level manipulation which we see with fiats.

Depends on the exchange, as far as legally I think. Many exchanges have got hacked, closed, scammed, or whatever. The safe and healthy thing to do is get your coins off exchanges.
@_date: 2019-03-22 06:02:54
Using something like a Nano Ledger S, your private key is not even exposed on your device (the ledger’s screen) which is not itself connected to the internet.
The safest place to keep your private key is fully cold, like a piece of paper - at this point, it’s like saying keeping your money under a mattress is the only way to protect it.
If you wish to spend it, or move it, or trade it, or tip it, or whatever, it’d be wise to keep a little in a “hot” wallet.

All bitcoin are generated through “mining”, just like paper currencies are “printed”. As someone new to the space, that is not important yet.
To get bitcoin in turn for another currency (USD, franc, etc) you need to find an exchange and trade for it. Gemini, Coinbase, or Kraken are likely to be a good app/site to trade your fiat (government backed currency) for it.
Once you trade for it, it is not yours until it is in your wallet. Similar to going to a grocer and giving them your dollar bills for some food, it is not really yours if you just leave it in the check out aisle.
You must bring it home. To do this, you must send your BTC from an exchange to a personal wallet address. For this, you simply need to generate an address and make sure you save your private key. This is like having a home address you live in and store your goods in. I recommend looking into Trezor, Nano Ledger S, or paper wallets.
@_date: 2019-11-09 19:27:23
Idk If I would post this, I had a pretty trivial time identifying your address. Just a heads up to be safe out there :)

If we’re to be picky, only exponents of 2 should really be relevant. Computers don’t operate on decimal systems, and the 1/21 goals are fundamentally arbitrary since they arent based on binary.

He was hardly accurate. $5300 in April wasn't a wild call. I and many others bought/longed well below because of various reasons - fundamentals or TA could have led to an optimistic notion that a test of $6k could happen within several months.
July 2019 we started at $14k! His $9200 barely got tapped, and was the low point of the month... I call his prediction a miss considering the price _high_ of the month was 50% higher.
October isn't going to happen (as much as I'd enjoy it). This meme really makes me think twice about market participants considering it isn't really impressive at all that _one_ person sorta got 2 price points somewhat close from a bullish perspective.
Anyways, long btc, short the banks.

Start with bitcoin. The other commenter is just suggesting to make a riskier play since BTC has reached (so the argument goes) a value closer to it’s true and ultimate value, while some alts (alts=coins that arent btc) may have not yet. Thats a discussion to research and decide for yourself _once_ you understand what BTC is and why it’s so important (decentralized, trustless, censorship-resitant, deflationary, etc) you can research smaller and riskier projects. But definitely start with BTC, especially given timid market conditions you shouldnt have too much FOMO. Good luck!

@_date: 2019-01-05 05:23:11
This is why I ladder in and out of positions. Admittedly sometimes I ladder in/out too quickly, but generally it covers me for this.
For instance, sell like 25% when you think we’re near the top of a run / you are happily in profit. If it keeps going, sell another bit. Always a small fraction though. Toggle the percentages as you like, but eventually when it comes back down, you should have some of your position safe still in the asset (so you would have profited with any run), but also now you have fiat or whatever ready to buy the dips. Do the same when buying back in. Not as great of gains, but safer entry/exit on trades of this sort.

Yep. I think about this often. I think of new fast food restaurants where the menus are all on the screen. You (price API) can easily calculate usd&lt;-&gt;btc price if you start taking both, and display them both on those dynamic screens.
Imagine when that is widespread enough that at a grocer each cluster of items has a smaller screen, or elongated screens at the bottom of shelves (I hope that makes sense). At some point, people will start co-existing values in their head. Like cm/inches - people know how to roughly switch between the two (I think) in the US. That will be a transitionary stage.

I was making a broader statement that not wanting to improve on ‘acceptable’ solutions is a silly way to hinder progress.
To answer your more concise question, what comes to mind quickly: no single point of failure, meaning from a security standpoint they are superior and can’t be tampered - this will also have benefits if we continue to trend to a decentralized economy for mom and pop producers.
Of last note, this is not a use case I care all that much about; energy distribution, representation of debt (money), and “social economy” tokens like a Lyft coin are much more appealing to me. I don’t own supply chain tokens and think that use case exists but is more forced than those that I just mentioned.
