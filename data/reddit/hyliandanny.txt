Looks like there’s more on the left! Might you have more of the art?

From reading your post, my mining would qualify as a business expense. This year, I may rent space to store our growing number of machines (LTC, but I imagine same rules apply).  Part of that rent is paid in BTC.
If I pay BTC or LTC for the rent, on whom does the tax responsibility fall?  Both of us (miner &amp; space owner)?  Since I'm paying for a service (rental of space), your text implies that it's a realization of gains.  Since they're getting LTC/BTC for selling a service, that seems like taxable income.
Is this accurate?  Can I use that $25 rent cost in LTC/BTC as a deduction -- even though it was just a transaction from my digital wallet to their digital wallet?

Is taxable gain 100% of the used coin value if I mined it myself?
Odd to think of the two ways that could be taken:
- I paid $0 for the LTC growing in my wallet, so 100% of it will be taxable gain.
- We've paid a couple thousand for our machines, so it's all a… loss?
This comes form the statement someone made about getting $99 taxable gain on a BTC that had cost me $1 to purchase.
Thank you very much for posting!

Why do you say this? Why would anyone make a decision based on speculation?
I can respect that you believe it.  Good for you.  But why would you tell others this?  Do you believe your speculations to be anything but?
Sorry for my tone -- it's just that I've learned so much while investing, and a lot of it is based on my actual experience in software development and project management. To hear people simply say "What if…!?" leaves very, very much unsaid while sounding conclusive.

Neither your content nor bitcoin matter in this scenario since those are just the mediums for the actions you're ultimately talking about: free content and donations.
Both are harsh business models. Another commenter has already noticed that even bitcoin enthusiasts don't tip well. Free content is great for distribution and access, but the other end of that blade is your dependency on ads and viewers' hatred of ads.
The business models themselves need to be improved. This is what you've got for now, though. I'm at a little startup that's trying to provide another option, so please don't think I'm not sympathetic: I'm just a bit surprised that you'd turn your attention to that subset of people that prevent advertisements on their screen. BuzzFeed it up, man or gal. That's the business you're in until you figure out a better way to make monies by writing!

This kind of sensationalism hurts this subreddit’s credibility.

What should I consider when treating bitcoin like an investment?  Is there anything obvious that makes this a bad idea?

If you'll accept feedback, I'd suggest that you change one sentence a bit.
"Would you ever consider having your web developers implement Bitcoin [payments for] your site?"
Just something that my non-technical mother might understand better than "implement Bitcoin", which sounds a bit nebulous ("Could you implement hyper warp money on your website?").

Thanks for your review.  I did not click the article until after I read your comment.

Like bitcoinjj, I also would appreciate some form of proof from you.

The "could be stolen" aspect is the one that most concerns me.  Is there not a common service that is considered most secure or stable?
What is the e*trade of bitcoin?

Thank you for actually answering the question!
As a very new entrant that finally took a plunge after too much speculation (and my order's still not through...), my biggest concern was whether the site was trustworthy.  Coinbase ended up being the most trustworthy site I could find, and I'm getting the lame errors described by the original post.
Is there a way to quantify which of your suggestions are trustworthy?  Is there a way to quantify the trustworthiness of any bitcoin purchasing site?
