Bitcoin is the protocol, and Bitcoin Core is an implementation of the protocol. It is not an 'alt'.

There are other implementations besides Bitcoin Core which do not try to force protocol changes and are also not considered alts. Litecoin is an alt.

More accurately, Hearn would be "king of a hard fork". If those two actually had majority support like you say, we would have forked already. Fact is, about 2% of full nodes were foolish enough to switch to XT. And it wasn't 'one mining pool that said they will never run XT since the hard fork would be a de facto altcoin that could decimate bitcoin. It was F2Pool, BTCChina Pool and Huobi Pool, and they account for over a quarter of hashing power. Before you accuse anyone else of lying, you yourself should stop lying.

You are so full of shit! Fucking LIAR! All five of your links express a will to increase the blocksize. They do NOT express any will to switch to Hearn's altcoin and there is still no consensus about HOW to increase it. Even Gavin admits that. 
You can download XT if you really want [your precious altcoin]( If it had majority support like you keep pretending it does, then it sure as fuck would be more than 2% of the network. Put your money where your mouth is and spool up about 20,000 XT nodes, because that's what it would take to set your altcoin into motion. Better yet, stop talking out your asshole.

What kool aid? I'm just explaining a couple simple facts to you.


Now you understand why a story about a libertarian-leaning candidate talking to the bitcoin audience is getting upvoted in this subreddit. People who support sound money such as bitcoin are promoting it in libertarian political circles.


Libertarians understood the advantages of a decentralized, fixed monetary supply early on. It's not their fault if other political ideologies fail to embrace it because it doesn't suit their debt-based agenda.
Take a chill pill. If you support the idea of sound money, maybe it's time for you to acknowledge that you've got a little libertarian in you after all.
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:16:17
What if the cheap coin lasts a lot longer than the next few years?
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:17:45
If that political figure had a history of promoting sound monetary policies and wrestling control away from central banks, then probably. I'm not aware of many politicians who are willing to address these issues though.
@_date: 2015-04-20 11:04:15
Bitcoin aligns with some political ideologies more than others. Some ideologies think that central banks should have full control over the monetary supply. Some other ideologies think that such centralized control has caused huge problems with the economy. Those from the latter camp find bitcoin attractive because bitcoin has a fixed supply that is not controlled by a central bank. Most people who think that central banks should control monetary supply absolutely despise bitcoin. Bitcoin **is not libertarian**, but libertarians find that it suits their political ideology very well. Don't ignore these facts willfully, and don't downvote people who take the time to explain them to you.
@_date: 2015-04-20 09:17:21
Didn't say it was. However, a large percentage of the bitcoin userbase believes in sound money, which overlaps greatly with libertarian ideals, and directly conflicts with the ideals of our primary political parties.

It's frightening that a professional Economist and CPA doesn't understand the difference between supply deflation and market value deflation. 
When people say that BTC is deflationary, they're saying that the final supply is limited to 21 million and that supply deflation will kick in as more coins get lost and fewer coins get generated. Since a single bitcoin is near-infinitely divisible, this is not a problem.
You've illustrated market value inflation, which can be dangerous for lenders. Conversely, market value *de*flation is dangerous for *lenders*. For example, if I borrowed 1000 BTC in 2013 when they cost $1000, my loan would be worth $1 million USD. If my loan agreement stipulated that I must repay the BTC value (as in your example), I could repay all 1000 BTC today at the USD value of $220k. That's a pretty good deal!
Of course, this is an issue with ANY currency or asset that fluctuates dramatically against whatever you're comparing it to. It's not unique to bitcoin at all and it only depends on which currency the loan should be based on. If the economy is primarily BTC based, then a loan for 1 BTC will be repaid as 1 BTC, regardless of what happens to USD value inflation, or any other currency. USD has the same risks, only they are entirely unpredictable because the central bank can choose to double the money supply over night.

I got some testnet coins now and I set the option to "Mix funds on this pocket" and left it open. It's been almost a day and it still says

This lawyer thinks the IMF needs to start acquiring bitcoin reserves, either by requiring member countries to pay a portion of their subscription in bitcoin, or by purchasing bitcoin directly, and the longer they wait, the harder it will be to acquire substantial reserves. Whoa.

The Texas Rangers have been eliminated from the postseason playoffs by the Toronto Blue Jays. What compromises can we expect from the Toronto Blue Jays to compensate the Texas Rangers for their loss? Will the Blue Jays need to compensate even further for every consecutive win?

I don't understand how anyone can *not* be a privacy enthusiast at this day in age. Seems like it should be mandatory for anybody who wants to build a userbase. Otherwise the privacy of all those users would be at risk.

In that case, just use rushwallet.

He's messing with you, but you should meet in a public place. And it would be a good idea to bring a smart phone that you can use to verify the transaction gets confirmed. But in that case you might as well scan the public address into a watch only wallet.

That is actually very low if you're terrible about money management. Bitcoin doesn't help people who are bad with money, except maybe that they can't go into debt yet.
