The "lack of consumer protection" thing bothers me more than any other criticism because it is so blatantly false. 
Bitcoin allows people to actually hold their own money, without having to trust a third party. They can do transactions without having to trust third parties with their sensitive financial information. Their bitcoins cannot be garnished. They cannot be taken without the private key. They cannot be frozen and they cannot be inflated. There can be no disputes over payment because the blockchain is public.
WHAT OTHER CURRENCY CAN MATCH THIS KIND OF CONSUMER PROTECTION!??!

People aren't so concerned about transaction times as we expected they would be. Most purchases are either small enough that a zero-confirmation transaction is fine or take place over time such that the parties can wait for the confirmations.


This will not be the case if everybody switches to litecoins. In other words, it's not a feature of litecoins themselves but rather a feature of their relatively low popularity.

And by what method did you expect that comment to further your progress toward that goal? What did you think was going to happen? 
This is what I don't get. People openly state their goals, then act in a way that is completely contrary to the achievement of those goals. Like this - Coinbase has your money, and instead of acting in a way that will make them want to help you out and repair their failures, you jab one of their low-level tech support guys with these passive-aggressive taunts.
That's not how people who want their money back should act. What I think is more likely is that you wanted to vent your anger and found a good target in Ken. 
Just be honest about it. You didn't get on that tech support chat to help get your coins, you got on it to bitch at whoever was on the other end. Do you really think that's going to produce good results? Do you really think you're contributing to society acting like this?

Many people incorrectly think that value is a property of an item. The truth is that value is in the mind. It's a description about how we as humans feel about that item. What gives bitcoin value is the same thing that gives all valuable things value - we see them as a means to an end.

This makes me uncomfortable. We don't need a unified front. We don't need one solution. We don't need one strategy.

($400 billion / 100) / 13 million = $308 per coin to cover that amount of value.
That's a really rough guess. It represents the amount of value bitcoin should jump up from current price, assuming a lot of things about the speed of money transfer, and that bitcoin currently isn't being used for international remittance, and that the price isn't already taking into account that it might be.
Basically, we don't know.

Why do the people have to buy their bitcoins from people in the same country? Isn't the entire world one big bitcoin market?
But even if, for some reason, people in countries with bad inflation could only buy bitcoins from sellers in their own country, there will be people that need the devaluing currency, for instance, to pay for things which can't be bought with bitcoin. 
For instance, if I lived in a country like this, I'd sell some BTC to buy the local currency to pay my rent, perhaps. Then I'd immediately give the rent to the landlord so I wouldn't have to hold the shitcoin local currency for very long.

It's possible. It's hard to define a speculative bubble, so without getting too technical I'd say the big 2011 run-up was such a bubble (if we're assuming that a speculative bubble is a real thing). 


Because some old codgers will never buy bitcoins directly but may be convinced to buy an ETF because ETFs have certain rules and oversight, etc.

Yes. Some people speculate that this downward pressure is what is keeping BTC from going up in value over the last couple of months.

The network confirms the transactions, but that takes some time. When the transaction is broadcast, it gets swept up with all other transactions and put into the public ledger - called the blockchain. 
Since this ledger is public, anybody can inspect it. Blockchain.info is simply a website that is set up to do this. You can put in any bitcoin address, and it will pull up all the information on that address.
The blockchain (not to be confused with blockchain.info) is the key innovation of bitcoin. 
So it's not a receipt, but it's an interesting way to view the transaction happening.

Most of the available gold and on earth was deposited by meteorites (during the late heavy bombardment, I think) because the gold that was there when the earth formed sunk down to the core.

This is the idea behind the famous "51% attack". Yes, they can create a fake block. Yes they have to win the race once. Yes, it's a valid concern.
Don't worry too much about it, though - the resources required are ridiculously prohibitive. The bitcoin network is the most powerful distributed computing network in the known universe. It might be possible to use the network against itself by taking control of a few of the largest pools, but even that isn't a really "sure" thing.

One way of implementing this would be to use a proprietary system for assigning in-house txids to withdrawls. Perhaps something that includes the time and date, as well as the inputs/outputs.

@_date: 2014-02-21 23:10:42
Yes, except there is one problem: Mt. Gox won't allow any withdrawls from their site. When they were allowing withdrawls, the prices tracked very closely, because the moment one exchange had a higher price, people would buy at other exchanges and sell on the higher-priced exchange, thus increasing supply on that exchange and lowering price. 
That practice - called arbitrage - is not possible anymore, which is why the price on Gox is so much different.

Yesterday I was wondering about this, so I did some rough calculations:
Assuming bitcoin eventually does 2000 transactions per second (that's approximately what Visa does) by the time the mining reward in new coins will drop to near zero in 100 years, if you want the block reward to be the same as it is now ($16,500), then the average transaction fee would need to be about 1.3 US cents. 
Obviously there are several problems with this, but it's a start. Things that matter: transaction volume and mining costs (related to mining difficulty).

I don't know what you're talking about. Have you ever done a bitcoin transaction? Do you know that there is a very small fee built into the transactions, even now? Do you realize that fees charged by exchanges are different than fees charged by the network itself? Do you realize that even with included fees, using bitcoin is cheaper than the alternatives (credit cards, paypal, etc), especially for large transactions?


No, what I'm telling you is that even with those fees included, bitcoin will still be cheaper to use than the alternatives. 
Do you realize that for things like international remittance, people are paying fees up to 33% to transfer money? Do you realize that even in a worst-case scenario for bitcoin, the fees will be nowhere even close to this?
Do you realize that credit card companies charge a few percentage points on *every* transaction? Do you realize that you are paying this fee every time you swipe a card? Do you realize that inflationary monetary policy charges you a hidden penalty of a few percent per year, every year, on any dollars you have? Do you realize bitcoin can protect against *all* of these fees?
Nobody is saying bitcoin is perfect; what we're saying is that it's a lot better than the alternatives.

I'm a 'libertarian' (broadly speaking). I don't have money on Gox, but my thoughts are this:
1 - you're assuming that "regulation" prevents situations where companies collapse and lose a lot of people's money. This is false, obviously. Enron comes to mind, as well as some Canadian mining company that someone posted about here earlier today.
2 - Gox's decline was not a surprise at all. People have been warning about Gox for months. 
3 - You're assuming that regulations don't already apply to the bitcoin economy. This is false. All relevant regulation applies as much to bitcoin companies as it does any other company (ID verification requirements, etc for example).
4 - I'm pretty tired of this retarded quip about regulation from people who think they are 3smart5you. Screw off.

There are services that will allow you to accept bitcoins, then will immediately convert them to dollars and send you the dollars at the current exchange rate.
You can charge, say $1,000 (payable at current rates in bitcoin), your clients will send bitcoin, and you will receive $1,000 (in dollars).
Bitpay.com does this for a very reasonable fee.
Or you can do it yourself - open an account at an exchange and use that to convert bitcoin to dollars whenever you happen to receive them. This will protect you against a lot of the volatility.
I seek out merchants who accept bitcoin, and I would definitely prefer to pay in bitcoin for almost everything. 
Realistically,though, you might only get a very occasional client paying in bitcoin.

The only way you can really be sure of the answers to your questions is to learn code and then take a look at the Bitcoin source code. 
Barring that, you'll have to trust those who have already done that, which is usually just as good. What do people who are familiar with the code say about it? Do they criticize it?
Do the silly objections (blockchain file size, etc) come from people who are familiar with the code or do they come from people who are ignorant of it?
Do the people who are familiar with the code buy bitcoins? Do they tell others to stay away? 
Answering these and similar questions are probably the best way to really verify the integrity of bitcoin.

Gox is totally incompetent. The coins either weren't in cold storage, or Gox kept shoveling them into hot storage without realizing what was happening. Either is possible. 


Like I said, they are incompetent. They don't even know what they are talking about. So it really could be anything. But maybe Karpeles didn't understand the situation at that point. Or maybe he was lying. Or maybe he didn't believe the numbers. Or maybe nobody had told him. Or maybe etc etc. 
If Karpeles believed his 'cold storage' coins were still in their safe places at that point, he would have made that statement. If the coins weren't *really* in cold storage, but rather were somehow linked to hot wallets, then they could have been drained without him knowing.

The reason you are being taught Keynesianism is because it favors policies that benefit the politically connected - the very people who are in charge of what you are being taught in school.

I regularly spend my coins. I bought lunch just yesterday with bitcoin.


I already use Gyft to spend BTC on Amazon and I'm trying to buy a new computer with BTC. I am hoping Newegg starts accepting them in the next month so I can buy it there.


This is related to the first point and already dealt with.

Because they may be offered a discount to use bitcoin from retailers who don't wish to pay a fee to the credit card companies.
Because they don't have to rely on banks to hold their money. This may be due to ideological reasons.
Because paying for things in bitcoin is easy and looks cool.
Because they don't have to send sensitive information to the merchant (ie Target) or other third parties to pay for things over a distance.
Because bitcoin will be as easy to use as other currencies at that point, if not easier.
Because if bitcoin reaches that amount, there may be no other stable currencies.

I interpreted the question differently, as "is it possible to send bitcoins without making an entry into the blockchain?" The answer to that is yes. If the question is about bitcoins actually leaving the blockchain, the answer is no (as you say) because, of course, there are no bitcoins - only the ledger (the blockchain).

I stopped reading. Intrinsic value is a complete myth. There is no such thing. Value isn't in objects, or a property of things, it is only in the mind - it's a description of how we humans feel about various objects.

Exactly. Huge demand for BTC on the site due to people trying to get out, very low supply for the same reason. Thus, wow, so moon, very interplanetary.

I'm getting pretty tired of hearing people say this kind of thing. Your statement contains two false claims. 
The first is that insider trading is illegal in a regulated market. This may be true in some cases, but it's not necessarily so. It's only true if the regulations are created that make it illegal. It's like saying "It's illegal to go 60 miles per hour on roads with speed limits." - Yeah, on some roads that may be true, but not on others.
The second false claim is that bitcoin isn't a regulated market. All current regulations apply to bitcoin as much as to anything else. Just because there aren't bitcoin-specific laws doesn't mean that there aren't laws affecting bitcoin users. Just because the bitcoin economy doesn't have its own set of regulations doesn't mean it doesn't have regulations. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:51:44
To add one more way of getting a better chance of success - couldn't you create a few transactions, all with a miner fee and all to different "safe" addresses, then broadcast them as soon as the theft occurs. If you broadcasted 4 "safe" transactions every time there was a theft, wouldn't that produce an approximately 80% chance of successfully defeating the theft, all else being equal?

Depends on how the price moves until the next "bubble" hits. If we slowly get to $1,000 again and then start a big upswing it could be $6,000. If we get to $1,500 again before the next big upswing, we could be looking at $9,000. It just depends on what happens between now and then.

It's not BitCoin, it's bitcoin. Only people who hate bitcoin call it BitCoin.
And they aren't private because of the way the blockchain functions - it must be public in order to verify the transactions.

Our answers were serious - bitcoin isn't a monolithic entity. It's nothing more than a protocol.
Bitcoin isn't "meant" to do anything other than provide consensus across a distributed network.
Any other goals or ends are merely the goals and ends of its users. And there are no right or wrong answers because each person's goals are different.

We actually had a situation where the devs introduced a bug into the software (not on purpose, mind you) last year. Someone running the new software mined a block which was rejected by all the nodes running the old version. 
And what happened? Well sure as shit nobody wants to mine blocks that get rejected by the network, and so within hours everybody reverted back to the old software.
That's what will happen the next time something like that comes along as well. 


Well then they might pull one over on us. It's certainly possible. Nobody is saying bitcoin is perfect. What I think most of us are saying is that it beats the available alternatives by a wide margin.
It's true that bitcoin has that particular vulnerability, but so does everything else, and all the other stuff has many more that bitcoin does not have. 
Because of the way the network works, as soon as this technically brilliant villain sprang his trap, everybody would revert to a previous version.

Re: lack of chargebacks, there is a corollary to that which benefits users at the expense of merchants, and kind of balances the equation: unlike other modern payment systems, the *sender's* keys are required to initiate a transaction.

Legal positivism is a fucking joke. The law doesn't determine what is theft. Logic does. Words have meaning. Theft is taking property belonging to someone else without their consent. Nothing to do with what the law says. Sure, the law provides a legal framework for punishing theft, but it doesn't get to define theft any way it wants.

That number is a result of the size of the mining network. If you have a smaller mining network, it won't be as difficult.
In the beginning, bitcoins were mined on just one desktop PC. It all depends on how the code is set up and how many people are using it. You could, in theory, set up a currency that was mined exclusively by your company's servers at a certain pre-determined rate.

False. Nobody knows the location of Satoshi at the time he created bitcoin.


That has never been a part of bitcoin, let alone the 'foundation.' Satoshi himself recognized that bitcoins would be lost and destroyed.


It's not an alternative to money, it IS money, and it doesn't matter whether governments tolerate it.


Same bizarre claim as above.


Wrong again (we're starting to see a theme here). They aren't destroyed, they are in someone else's hands.


That's three strikes on the same nonsense claim.


Here the author carefully slips in the claim that the blockchain accounts for bitcoins held by exchanges in addition to wallets. This is false. The blockchain tracks addresses, nothing more. Nobody has ever claimed anything else.

You are a fucking idiot. 
Here are the steps, assuming you already own some bitcoin.
1 - spend bitcoin (let's say it's 0.01) on some good or service.
2 - buy 0.01 btc from your favorite exchange immediately to avoid btc price movement.
You will be spending the exact same number of fiat as you would have by just spending them directly on the item you needed, and you will end up with the exact same number of bitcoin. This shows that your original claim of "only a fool would spend his bitcoin now" is stupid - there's no harm in doing so. You can do so without losing your btc holdings. 
Second, it is often possible to get a discount by using bitcoin. As an example, using Gyft you can get 3% off. In those cases the above applies, with the small caveat that it's actually cheaper to spend your money in this way - using bitcoin and replenishing it as needed, than it is to simply spend your fiat.
Until you get these simple concepts figured out, I suggest you keep it down.

Transaction fees for merchants are much higher for credit cards than with bitcoin, even after counting the fees charged by the bitcoin payment processor.
Thus, it is in the interest of the merchant to entice people to spend bitcoin (because the merchant will be able to keep more of their money rather than giving it to credit card companies).
In order to entice people to use bitcoin, the merchant should offer to split their savings with their bitcoin customers. They would still come out ahead on transactions compared to credit card transactions, and would entice more people to use bitcoin.

Because you can't eat bitcoin, drive bitcoin, make phone calls with bitcoin, or wear bitcoin. In short, because people need stuff. Also, it's possible to spend bitcoin and immediately buy the same amount to replenish your savings. This protects against the kind of situation you are rightly asking about.


It's not hoarding, it's saving. It's one of the ways the market regulates prices. Saving is a fundamental requirement for a healthy market. The fact that people have forgotten this just shows how fucked up the modern economic situation is.

There is legal recourse. Current property laws apply equally to bitcoin as to any other asset. And if you have done the due diligence that is typical for a mortgage, you will be able to ding the person's credit score, find their close relatives, track them down, and file suit. Just like today. 
There's nothing new with bitcoin that makes lending any harder than it already is. 


This is true of dollars as well, but that doesn't mean people don't do loans in dollars.

No, but seriously, the answer to your question is the price mechanism. If power requirements get too large to mine, miners will drop out, lowering power usage, or more efficient chips will be made, or more efficient power generation will be made. Let the market do its thing.

False. Even now when bitcoin is inflationary, its supply is still not growing faster than the dollar.
To answer the title question - there is a limit of 21 million coins that can be mined. After that, no more. 
Also, let's put that question in other contexts. 
How Can Gold Be Worth Anything When People Can Just Mine More Of it?

I grant that it doesn't solve every problem, but most people aren't doing complex trading, so using better practices will go a long way.


This again should be part of good practices - you shouldn't make deposits in exchange with a horrible reputation, and should know what withdrawl options are available you.


Yes, which is why I am calling for better user practices.


It's called saving, and it's necessary for a healthy economy. Don't try to give me any Keynesian BS about aggregate demand either. It is risky to hold coins in a hot wallet, but it's an acceptable risk, as long most your coins are cold storage. There's no reason not to keep a little spending money a hot wallet.


Regulation doesn't do shit. Remember Enron? Lehman Brothers? Bernie Madoff? The tired old trope that regulation stops Gox like problems is childish nonsense. Nobody believes it.


I'm not aware of anyone who believes this. Again, if users take security seriously, the more open and transparent exchanges will make the most money. There's no reason to separate personal gain for exchange owners from community service. 


Again, regulation doesn't stop this kind of thing, and there is a reason for other exchanges avoid it. At the first sign of Gox behavior, everybody should take all their money out of the offending exchange. There's money to be made in operating an exchange.


Fuck off. Regulation sucks. It never does the problems it claims to, and usually ends up making things worse.

This is not true. One of the strengths of bitcoin is that you DONT' have to reveal your key to transact in bitcoin, unlike credit cards (where you have to give your card details to the merchant who may accidentally reveal them to the public a la Target).

But cryptos aren't "backed" by that kind of thing usually. If a company created a crypto currency that was backed by them (that is, they offered a fixed exchange rate between the crypto and some aspect of their firm), it would be a single point of failure, and not decentralized at all, which defeats the whole reason most people are interested in bitcoin. So such a currency wouldn't pull hardly anybody from bitcoin.

*EDIT* by the way, central banks do not achieve price stability. The average lifespan of a fiat (ie central bank) currency is 27 years and usually ends in hyperinflation.

Wallet to wallet transactions are either free or come only with miner fees.


It's actually cheaper than the alternatives. As a typical example: I use Gyft to pay for lunch at Burger King. They give me a 3% discount for paying in Bitcoin from my Mycelium wallet. Because I don't want to lose my savings, I immediately turn and buy from Coinbase the same amount of coins that I just spent. CB charges a 1% fee. Also, because I'm generous, I pay a 1% miner fee on the transaction.
Thus, even though I'm paying fees to Coinbase *AND* Mycelium, I still end up paying *less* than I would have paid if I would have used dollars.


No, this is wrong. It doesn't depend on them. You chose to use them, but bitcoin can be used without using third party companies if that's what you want to do.


I bought honey and honey products from Bees Brothers in person and paid no fees because neither of us used a third party.


You don't have to, but even if you did, you may be missing the point of bitcoin: it's the blockchain. It offers so many things that other payment networks simply can't offer. Lower fees is only one.

You can use a wallet like Mycelium to scan the private key to import it. There should be an option to "import private keys". Then you can send the coins to any other address you like - including one in your main wallet.

That criticism applies equally to all currencies. Any currency could lose value. In fact all government fiat currencies are *designed* to lose value over time via a process called inflation. So that's not a reason to avoid bitcoin and prefer other currencies.
Bitcoin is mathematically limited to 21 million coins after which there will be no more. Increasing adoption of the valuable properties of bitcoin will necessarily lead to higher prices.

$1 billion of that number is tax breaks - *not* subsidies. But the NYT called them subsidies. I don't defend the position that there is anybody who exclusively calls tax breaks subsidies. I'm just saying people call tax breaks "subsidies" for the reasons I've already mentioned.

That's not necessarily true. If the difficulty changes after 1 hour, then a chip which can do the high GH/s over a shorter period of time may be more profitable.

The protocol itself.

No. This is just false. There is no correlation between labor and value. Stop thinking that. Some things that you work at have value, but only because you knew it would be worth exchanging your labor for it ahead of time.

I think you're getting a little mixed up. You can keep your coins in your own wallet, and only you will have access to your coins. It's just that when you use an exchange, you are basically opening an account with them and giving them access to whatever you store in their account. 


All transactions are recorded on the public ledger called the blockchain, forever. But the information that is stored is just the wallet addresses. If you have your own wallet, there may be nothing to connect you to that wallet. Not so with an exchange - where you have to provide ID, etc.

No, this isn't true. You're playing loose with definitions. The companies don't force their employees into anything. The employees are always free to seek better circumstances elsewhere. They have no obligation to remain employed at the offending company, nor does any company have an obligation to hire any particular employee.

I have a new idea. I will call it "SATOSHI'S LAW":
The quality of the criticism of bitcoin is inversely related to the change in price over the last 2 weeks. That is, if the price change is high (either lower or higher), the quality of the criticism of bitcoin will be low. If the price change is low (the price is stable) the quality will be higher.

The easiest analog to understand is something like nuclear launch codes. You don't want just one person having authority to launch all the nukes, so you create a system where several trusted people have unique codes, and the system requires that all of them type in the codes to launch a missile. This prevents just one maniac from wreaking havoc. 
But what happens when one of your 7 launch-code holders gets killed by the enemy, or isn't available? Now you are completely unable to launch any nukes at all. 
The compromise is M of N. You give unique codes to 10 people, and require that 7 or more input their codes in order to launch a nuke. That way, if any 3 are incapacitated or otherwise unable to be present, you can still use your nukes, but without any risk of just one or two nutcases taking control of the whole system. 
Make sense? Do you see how this applies to bitcoin storage for a company like Coinbase?

What do you propose we do to exchanges who don't wish to use 3fa? How will you stop them?
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:36:05
Well, let's see. It was created under the shadow of a massive regulatory apparatus. It's creator noted the government bail-outs in the creation of the blockchain. It exists in a world where other currencies are declared to have value by government fiat, and where any law-enforcement, or property protection can be done only by permission of the monopoly State. People using bitcoin for free-market purposes have been arrested, threatened, exiled, etc. by agents of the State. All exchanges are required by to follow a grievous and arbitrary set of regulations. The State taxes bitcoin transactions, income, and capital gains. That's off the top of my head. If you want more, I'll send you more later mmmkay?

"Value is not intrinsic, it is not in things. It is within us; it is the way in which man reacts to the conditions of his environment. Neither is value in words and doctrines, it is reflected in human conduct. It is not what a man or groups of men say about value that counts, but how they act."

Here we go:


This is a fabrication. On Bitstamp, the price went from about $730 to a low of $550 - approximately a 25% drop. At the time of publishing, the price was $650 - meaning bitcoin ended the week down about 12%.
If he's talking about Mt. Gox, we can dismiss his claims.


This is complete nonsense. Where is the evidence to support this view of bitcoin?


On Gox - an exchange that has been well-known for months to be seriously compromised, such that there is a pejorative term - Goxbucks - used to describe money in the exchange. 
That price does not reflect reality. On the open market, BTC is trading for twice that.


Bitcoin was $20 a year ago. It didn't even reach $300 until 3 months ago. It's up 200% since then.


I'm not aware of any exchange that has made that claim.
In addition, his prolific use of quotation marks is not only unecessarily demeaning, but it's terrible, terrible writing. This is supposed to be a professional-sounding article and instead it sounds like one of the FUD posts around here.


I'm not sure the devs (whose identities are publicly known) would really agree with that label.
The author makes the claim that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme but, as per usual, offers literally no evidence of any kind to support the claim. He apparently thinks the fact that the price is down is proof enough, but that's obviously a complete non-sequitur.

Depends on what you mean. They can threaten the people who use bitcoin, but since bitcoin itself is a totally decentralized intangible network, they can't threaten it. 
The analogue is bittorrent. They've threatened a few people, but bittorrent survives and they haven't been able to do shit to stop it.

According to someone whose job it is to make laws:
"As of December 2013, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows 1.3% inflation, while a recent media report indicated Bitcoin CPI has 98% deflation. In other words, spending Bitcoin now will cost you many orders of wealth in the future. This flaw makes Bitcoin’s value to the U.S. economy suspect, if not outright detrimental."

This is not true. Hayek showed that the federal reserve's central control on the interest rates caused the boom and bust of the business cycle (he won a Nobel Prize for his work on this, by the way). The artificially low interest rates created by the Fed stimulate bad investments and create economic bubbles followed by painful recessions - like the one we have seen in the last several years. Thus, the Fed is in fact the very cause of the economic turmoil it claims to protect against.


This is another common misconception - popularly satirized as "muh aggregate". In fact the supply of money isn't as important as some people claim. See this lecture for more:


We don't know really. It may be painful for a while (especially for those who rely on the cheap/free money from the Fed), but the end result is that we will no longer be subject to the "evil circle" of government fiat currency. We will have true monetary freedom - a free market in money.

We need to define terms. Inflation is an increase in the supply of money. Deflation is a decrease. 
Technically speaking, bitcoin is mildly inflationary until the block reward drops below the rate at which bitcoins are destroyed, at which point it is deflationary.
Gold itself isn't generally considered money, so definitions of inflation don't really apply to it. But if you are going to define gold as money, then if it is increasing in supply (by digging it out of the ground) then it is inflationary. If it is decreasing in supply (by being destroyed or used in components, etc), then it is deflationary.
But again, gold isn't money.

A reply is a double spend. It's possible that it could happen, as long as they had your keys, and then one would get accepted and the other rejected.

The strongest correlation that I've found is the level of understanding. 
The people who really understand the technical concepts, philosophy, and possible applications are *always* very positive. The people who are really negative *never* have a good grasp on the concepts.


No, it's that we see the potential that bitcoin has to do things like lift millions out of poverty, free people from the slavery of debt, allow the most vulnerable to control their own futures, make international remittance almost free, etc, etc. 


It doesn't have to live on *your* hard drive, it can stay on a server of another. Or it can live on a paper wallet. Or it can live in an encrypted file that you have copied to a couple of different places. 
But even if it just stays on your hard drive, what difference does it make? You can lose all types of money, why is the fact that you can lose bitcoin a reason not to use bitcoin? Are you wary of using cash, debit, checks, paypal, etc, because those things can also be lost?

Bitcoin flourishes under conditions of spontaneous order. Planned order isn't the direction we need to go. A central body, plan, or statement can be flawed, targeted, and criticized. If we show bitcoin instead of telling, by means of using it, saving it, buying it, selling it, we won't *have* to convince others.

Mining is not the best way to get bitcoin. How much do you need to get your hands on?
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:52:26


No. Don't do that. Many people don't have access to the same addresses at the same times - especially if they are using a hosted wallet.
You'll need to confirm some basic details about the order - maybe the order number, the shipping zip code, and last name of the customer. Then it shouldn't be too much of a hassle, especially if they return the same thing they bought. 
Or you can just give store credit (as long as you announce the policy upfront).

Point number 2 - I disagree. I'm a consumer; I don't think bitcoin sucks. Also, you are forgetting about horizontal spending whereby one spends bitcoin, and immediately re-purchases that same amount. This prevents this scenario:


But why would someone do that instead of simply spending their dollars on the item? Easy. You get discounts in a lot of places for spending bitcoin.

I'll give you the very very short version and you can go on after that?
We don't get to announce what the value of something is, because value isn't a property of objects. It's a completely subjective thing that exists only in the mind. You acknowledge that is "highly subjective" but that understates it - value is *totally* subjective.
Thus, statements like the following are incoherent:


There is no consensus, and never can be. Marginal utility and subjective value prevent there from ever being such a consensus.
Also, given the nature of value - not a property of an object but a condition in the mind, statements like this simply don't make sense.




Your statement implies throughout that value can be imparted to an object, that if we just push in the right direction at the right time, we can somehow give value to bitcoin. But that isn't possible because value doesn't exist in objects.
I see your point - that we can skip the fiat conversion altogether and just start pricing things in terms of bitcoin without having to go bitcoin&gt;fiat&gt;product (we can just go bitcoin&gt;product), but I think you have some wrong impressions about how that process works.

That's not backing. But let's pretend it is for the sake of the argument. If we accept that, then your claim that bitcoin has no backing fails. 
You can use bitcoin to create and enforce contracts, perform escrow, transfer property titles, prove authorship, etc - these uses are non-monetary and "back" it just like those other commodities have backing.

I believe bitcoin will be worth more in the future, but I have bills that need to be paid in the present, and physical hunger that needs to be satiated in the very near future, and things which I want to spend money on before the end of the year. So I'm going to sell bitcoins even though I know that if I save them they will be worth more later.

I disagree that no consumer protection is a decent argument. Bitcoin contains numerous consumer protections that are exclusive to bitcoin - a known and fixed rate of creation, lack of controlling entity, no requirement to tie an ID to a wallet, etc. 
In addition, there are the usual security features of bitcoin which prevent institutions from simply denying access to your funds or emptying your bitcoin account at their discretion. 
Finally, the blockchain is, in my view, one clear mechanism of consumer protection in that it preserves a record of every single transaction from the beginning for all of time. There can be no "we never got your payment" disputes because guess what - it's right there in the blockchain.

This is true of many things, not just bitcoin. Most attempts at new technology fail, most research doesn't pan out, most promising new drugs end up being dead ends, etc. 
The problem is we don't know ahead of time which ones will be successful so we have to try them all. The "wasted" ones are a necessary part of the "successful" ones.

2 - bitcoin prices remain as they are today, but bitcoins become widely accepted as currency
I know those two are closely connected, this is an imaginary thought-experiment, ok? Anyway, which would you prefer? As for me, without question I would prefer the second. And most bitcoin people I've asked this to agree.

OP, I hope you don't mind me pointing this out, but this is a variation of the "No True Scotsman" fallacy. It allows the person making the claim to say, "well, they didn't do it responsibly." The thing is, it's almost *never* done in a responsible way, and the times when it is, it's impossible to tell ahead of time if it is going to be successful - and usually it isn't. 
So even if we have to live without government control of monetary police (which I have no problem with), and that causes some negative effects (something which is not proven), we'll still come out ahead of the alternative - government control of the money supply. 
The average lifespan of a government fiat currency is 27 years and usually ends in hyperinflation.

It seems like a lot of your questions aren't really taking into consideration that we aren't living in a paradise. It seems like you are comparing bitcoin to an ideal perfect system. What you should be comparing it to is the alternatives. So if you think bitcoin has a problem that might slow adoption, ask yourself first if that problem exists in other systems and whether it has slowed adoption. If all other systems have the same problem, then it doesn't matter if bitcoin has them because it's a wash - it's not a reason to prefer something else to bitcoin.
It doesn't seem like a lot of your questions are doing this, and this is a failure because institutional investors do take this into consideration and you don't seem to be doing so.
In this particular case, you don't seem to be considering that this problem affects all systems which rely on more than one person (in other words, ALL SYSTEMS THAT EXIST).

Basically this. Small transactions aren't really at risk for double-spends. You can accept the tiny amount of risk that comes with letting customers walk out the door with zero-confirmation transactions.
For large transactions the time doesn't really matter (ie money transfers, internet purchases, etc), or the situation is such that you would be around anyway for a while (ie a car purchase).

Interest rates would still probably be positive, but because they wouldn't be a function of both inflation and risk, but risk alone, they might be lower. Or they might be higher because interest rates are kept artificially low at the moment thanks to Bernanke and Co.

No. I have a full time, middle class job. I support a family. I have two cars and a mortgage. I'm all in for this. Bitcoin will be as important as the internet.

No. If nobody spends any than it's not worth anything, so it is in the interest of savers (not hoarders, mind you, it's just saving) to see to it that bitcoins are spent.

The unbelievable feeling of watching something magical happening is one of the big draws of bitcoin. 
I've found that letting people perform a transaction is one of the most effective ways of convincing them of the validity of bitcoin.
There's something about watching it happen live.

A service which sells gift cards for bitcoin. They have a mobile app. 
So you go to the grocery store (Whole Foods or Target perhaps), load up on food, and then while you wait in line you open the app, purchase a gift card for the store with bitcoin, and then pay by scanning a bar code on your phone at the cash register.
