The money is already there, and you don't need to wait until the sync is complete. You can import your private key into multibit or mycelium right now and spend the coins. It's a good idea even if you don't want to spend the coins, because it's better to separate the full node from your money-holding wallet.
If the amount is substantial, it is better to keep it in an entirely offline wallet.

Bitstamp did this to me as well. So here's the gist:
1. They won't return balances less the $5 (reasonable, given the costs of manually processing transfers).
2. They won't return balances less than the cost of wire transfer. That bumps it up to $50 (sort of understandable, but annoying, and the $50 is not documented anywhere).
3. They won't return the balance in the form of BTC at the current exchange rate. This is completely unreasonable, and the reason I won't go back to bitstamp even if they wanted me back.
4. They won't give you any notice of an impending termination to give you a chance to convert your fiat into BTC and transfer it out yourself.
Basically they confiscated my balance (under $50) for a completely arbitrary and capricious made up reason.
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:46:41
Wait, bitcoin also takes seconds. The difference is that it is trivial to revoke credit card payments all the way until they settle, whereas it takes a lot of resources to override even a 0-conf once it's been broadcast (as long as it doesn't use RBF).

Leave blockstream out of it! I think they have enough on their plate with one side of the fork.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:24:12
They take the risk that the other miners orphan the block they mined.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:32:42
I second this. BTC, please make blocks smaller to increase decentralization and reject freeloader spam transactions. Let the cheapskates and useless poor folks use the cheap knockoff altcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:28:01
I don't see significant liabilities for customers in this case, if they limit the amounts locked into the sidechain, and if the sidechain is as permissionless and pseudonymous as bitcoin itself.
I do think there will be liabilities for sidechain operators (especially like bitstamp and coinbase) in that they will be bound by AML/KYC regulations in all the countries where they operate, and may not be able to legally provide this service without customer information at all.

The seed maps to a set of private keys. A private key is 256 bits, and a pubkeyhash (address) is 160 bits. So on average there are 2^96 private keys for each address.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:34:50
Can you show me an example of this?
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:46:50
I wasn't addressing the question (is coinbase's refusal to implement segwit an attack?) as much as the premise (high fees themselves are an attack). And "high" doesn't need to be subjective, just relative. Compare current fees to fees before blocks became full last year.
I also didn't imply that core has a financial incentive. In fact I wish they had a direct incentive in the form of payment for performance...
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:43:24
So is Bitcoin broken?
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:28:28
If current spam is 10% of the 1 MB limit, then it would cost them 71 times as much to fill up the blocks with the same high fee level.

Load up  on a live booted computer, then turn off the network, put Firefox in offline mode, and restore from the seed. Iff the addresses match those from the trezor wallet, you have the right seed.

Because if you do, my argument falls apart.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:57:11
~~Your~~ You're wrong. According to core devs, high fees and full blocks are necessary for there to be an incentive to implement and use LN. If fees were cheap no one would be encouraged to lock up funds in a channel.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:42:04
We need some sort of permission granting authority to determine who gets to use block space.

It's a lot cheaper than leaving them in the mempool. Ram is many orders of magnitude more expensive than spinning rust.

@_date: 2018-01-15 11:37:22
But who determines what is Bitcoin? I think in a decentralized network every player decides for the themselves. And just because you disagree with one player doesn't mean they are a scammer.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:41:58
What did you say?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:24:14
Time to find the latest block equals time to validate previous block plus time to select transactions for next block plus grind time.
When the previous block is small but the current block is huge, it is faster to validate the previous block and build a new one on top of it than it is to validate the current huge block and then build a new one on top of it.
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:46:02
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:07:05
Let's say there are only 900kB in legit transactions per block. On BTC, you would have to fill up at least 100 kB with spam transactions at some fee level, to force the remaining transactions to pay at least that much to confirm. If you raise the block size to 8 MB, now you have to fill up 7.1 MB with spam at the same fee level. That's 71x compared to the 1 MB spam cost.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:42:21
That assumes there are zero legit transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:49:50
Upvoted. This needs to be more visible.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:16:37
You have the seed written down, right? Enter that seed into the web form (with the PC offline). Then compare the addresses to those from the trezor. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:33:01
Because it takes too long to process. A miner who ignores a 1 TB block can find a competing block faster than another miner who tries to build on it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:08:41
Alts are up at least partly because bitcoin wasn't providing cheap fast and reliable transactions any more.

You can set up a daemon or script to rebroadcast it every couple of days. Then it will stay in the mempool until it is confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:54:38
Even if they have the same potential problem, that doesn't mean their solution isn't working now. It gives them more headroom to figure things out. They already have fixed third-party malleability. They can fix first-party malleability at some point given how open they are to hard forks. Then they can use LN without segwit if they have to.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:25:16
If lightning cuts down fees, won't people transact on-chain directly, since it will be cheap?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:52:16
The alignment of incentives. A currency that is usable is valuable. Miners will shoot themselves in the foot by clogging up a currency. If they wanted to, they could have continued mining 300 kB blocks. Why are all the blocks consistently full?

@_date: 2017-12-12 10:05:05
If the spam goes away, could the fees drop to less than 10c?
If they do, will there still be an incentive to use LN?
If there isn't, will the high fees and long backlogs come back, and stay permanently?
If that happens, will there be an incentive to pay for opening/closing LN channels with a high cost and unpredictable latency?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:23:50
See my comment above. Lightning cannot resolve the fee situation, because it needs this fee situation to make itself more compelling than on-chain transactions.

They don't need defending - they're not on trial. I'm pointing out the reason why it doesn't make economic sense for them to spend resources on the upgrade to segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:54:22
Are you talking about the exponential growth of the size of the mempool, the transaction fees, or the market share of competitive offerings?
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:03:49
Block weight is equivalent to block size. The weight of a transaction is exactly equal to 4x the size of a regular transaction, and is equal to a smaller amount for a segwit transaction. Since most people don't use segwit, in practice it makes no difference to them.

Try explaining how to get on to and transact on LN to someone who's new to crypto. Like a small online business maybe. Try explaining to them how they have to pay a large fee to open and close a channel, and then watch the blockchain like a hawk...

How often would a typical user need to open a channel?

What would the amortized cost per transaction be, for a typical user who makes say 10 transactions per day?
Is that cost still competitive compared to rival currencies?

You can import the receiving address from your ledger into mycelium without compromising your private key.
If you do use mycelium and the seeds for ledger and mycelium are the same, them you will need to delete app data for mycelium from system settings to erase the private keys.
If the seeds are different and you plan on sending the coins to your ledger, then the private keys on the phone are not a problem once the coins are moved out.

When the darknet markets and openbazaar (and other online merchants) accept BCH, it will create a natural and enthusiastic user base. We shouldn't be yielding this user base to them.

You don't need segwit for LN. You need to address malleability. BCH already has a fix for 3rd party malleability and plenty of time to address 1st party malleability using flex trans etc. The 32 MB blocks give BCH a huge amount of headroom (256x more growth than current usage).

Even if you are saying that only people who understand the issue should have influence, there are 2 things wrong with it. The explicit wrong is that everyone has and ought to have influence on the direction, as users, investors, infrastructure, merchants etc. There is no way otherwise to ensure that your interests are aligned with those of the experts.
The implicitly wrong assumption is that people who are commenting do not understand the issue. They do. Many people know the technology and the economics well enough to hold valid views on the direction of the project. Even if one doesn't understand the issues at the outset, there is enough information available to get a good understanding of all the issues to whatever depth one is comfortable with.
You could extend the argument to investing as well. Should only people who understand bitcoin invest in it (whether as holders or businesses)? What about stocks? Should everyone just rely on financial advisors instead of having their own brokerage accounts?

Lightning depends on on-chain being too expensive for small transfers. That means that all the small UTXOs (under 1 mBTC/ US$15) will continue to be unspendable even after lightning comes out.
If on-chain transactions remain cheap, that's what people will use, instead of locking up their funds in an LN channel and paying a fee (as well as needing a continuous transaction monitor) for the privilege. Ergo: low fees mean no viable LN.

If you only hold BTC rather than transact with it, Metcalfe's O(N^2 ) law does not apply. The premise of the law as it applies to bitcoin is this: of all the people and businesses you transact with, if the number that accept bitcoin goes from say 1/week to 10/week, then that's 10x more bitcoin usage from you alone. But there are 10x as many users as before, each of whom are doing 10 transactions/week, so the net effect is a 100x increase in transactions/week.
If everyone just buys and holds, then you merely get linear increase.

Bitcoin is trustless and permissionless. I don't want to take anyone's word for it that a certain way of building bitcoin is better than another. I want to see the research and the evidence myself, even if I'm not as qualified as some others to evaluate it. That's how checks and balances work in an open society.
You say that bcash is not facing the same scaling problems because there's not as many people using it. But if I'm accepting money online, if it's frictionless, fast and cheap, with all of bitcoin's PoW and secp256k1 based ECDSA security goodness, then it works better for me now. And by the way, it will work better for me even if it gets 8 times as much transaction volume as bitcoin. Why is that not better?
And of course I don't expect anyone to change bitcoin just because I "demanded it." But we're discussing things here because we're clearly interested and invested in this technology right? I'm not here just to curse at you (and I'm sorry if I did).

Many people disagree, but bitcoin's value comes primarily from its utility. Destroy the utility, and you destroy bitcoin's value. Miners have hundreds of millions invested in capital equipment, so they are necessarily in it for the long term. It makes as much sense for miners to contribute to the destruction of bitcoin's utility for short-term gain as it does for electrical contractors to steal all your copper wiring.

I think it would be better to increase the size of the increment (starting from 20 bytes) by 20% each year. There will still be no supply shock since this is only a limit, and not a minimum size. If the economy does not grow fast enough, blocks will stay smaller than the limit, which is not a problem.

The correct mechanism to find the right price isn't to impose constraints on the supply side or the demand side. It is to let the suppliers ask and demanders bid, and then run with the equilibrium.
Miners have always had, and will continue to have, the final say in which transactions they include in blocks. We should leave it up to them to decide what constitutes spam, and whether transaction fees are high enough for the block at hand.

The reward size itself is meaningless to the economy, just as long as its sufficiently divisible. I personally would have chosen the value 1.0 instead of 21M for the total number of bitcoins minted.

I still think bitcoin is the wrong method to do this. Suppose the auditors come knocking, find your lifestyle not justified by the income from your day job, and you say "because bitcoin." Well, next thing you will need to show is proof that you possess these bitcoins, and that you got them at the time and price you claim you did. The wide open nature of the block chain makes this ~~impossible~~ tricky to fake.

If you are planning on doing this you have to be mindful of security, of course. Make sure your phone has a PIN or pattern lock. Make sure it is encrypted. Only download apps you really trust (the trust requirements have to go up a couple of notches). Put a PIN on the mycelium app. Verify the backup before sending any coins to the wallet. If you are on android figure out how to remote lock and wipe your device using android device manager. I'm sure something similar exists for iOS as well.

Not everyone has to mine in order to use bitcoins. In fact, most bitcoiners don't mine.
Those who do mine, they do it for the block reward. That explains the incentive for the miners. Now what is the incentive for the rest of us to pay the block reward or transaction fees to miners? It is because unless they mine, there are no new blocks being found, which means transactions cannot be confirmed.
What the mining computer is producing is the next block, i.e. the next page in the public ledger of transactions. It is doing this work for all users who would like to transact using bitcoin.

So, if it's ever been written down somewhere online, it's not safe.
The best practice would be to take the brain wallet passphrase, append salt (say your email address) and then pick a largish number (the birth year of your parent or your zip code) and run those many rounds of scrypt on it to generate the private key.

First you'd have to agree on what level constitutes a bubble. Then, you'd have to send all the block rewards to an M-of-N wallet (where M &gt; N/2 for a majority vote). Even if you did that, it would only have an impact in terms of the size of the dump.

When you phrase it like that it sounds like a poor choice, of course.
How about this instead: the proper function of the government is to protect individuals. Hence, the only proper use of tax money is to run the military (also police and the courts).
Paying for schools is a decision that should be left up to individual parents (within the constraint that the rights of the children are also preserved). Therefore, government should spend more tax revenues on the military, and less on schools, and let parents manage school spending on their own.

There's no such thing as Chinese coins. If there is a price difference between China and outside, then arbitrage will quickly close it to the extent that it is profitable. It doesn't matter whether the overall prices are going up or down.
The effect of arbitrage on price direction is neutral.
However, the effect of *not* buying coins on offer when the ask prices are low will certainly pull prices down, so if you think prices are down because of dumping you can only help the situation by buying :-)

Many reasons:
People get carried away and invest borrowed money. When they lose that money on Gox, they try to recoup whatever they can on the other exchanges where they might have funds. (eg I use bitstamp, kraken and campbx but haven't used Mt Gox in a while).
Loss of confidence in bitcoin by people not as familiar with it can cause a sell-off. If one exchange goes down because of theft resulting from what it claimed were technical problems in Bitcoin, then maybe other exchanges and even their offline holdings could be at risk.
The suspicious-minded might reasonably think that Mt Gox is not done gambling with their customers' funds, and might still try to arbitrage/gamble/sell off whatever remains in their wallet to salvage the situation at the expense of the overall market.

There are a lot of very small outputs from this address, adding up to 0.24.
Does blockchain keep "your" btcs on your receiving address, or is it just a web wallet where the coins are associated with your account but not actually live at the receiving address?
If it is the latter case, then you can still withdraw your coins from the website.
Otherwise, this is an uninteded diversion of funds into other addresses (could be theft, hack or a bug).
Edit: just noticed you sent coins to sharedcoin, and looks like all 0.24 went to sharedcoin?

8 addresses, one wallet. Those 8 are just the ones it shows you. Electrum can generate any number of addresses from the starting seed and you only need the seed to recover them from another computer.

Hate to say it, but Bitcoin isn't an ideal way to transfer fiat when time is of the essence. It's a great way to transfer bitcoins, though.
If you have the luxury of time, you can be a market maker on localbitcoins (i.e., get mid-market rates or even charge a premium). Otherwise, you have to be a taker and buy/sell at the worse side of the spread, which could also cost you 6-8% ON EACH END.

Of course it's possible because the number of wallet addresses is very very large but still finite. It's not a practical worry though. See the analysis at 
It turns out that in practice there have indeed been address collisions which caused losses to some people. The reason for this wasn't dumb luck, but the use of a very bad random number generator.
Another way this happens is when people use brain wallets. [Hint: do not use brain wallets]. People think they are being very clever by choosing "correct horse battery staple" as their brain wallet password, but then someone else does the same thing and now they both have private keys to the same address.

You shouldn't think of bitcoin addresses (public and private keys) as accounts on the bitcoin network. Instead, think of them as a set of combination boxes on a 100-mile wide wall.
The receiving address just points to a box on this wall. Every possible receiving address already exists, but will only appear on the block chain once coins are sent to it.
With the private key, you can open this particular box.
The block chain only records what was sent to which address. It doesn't care whether a known public/private key pair maps to the address.
That is why you see transactions going to well-formed addresses like 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE or 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr which have no known public/private key, so bitcoins sent to them are effectively lost for ever.

These transactions are in the amounts of 1 satoshi each. That means it costs 1 BTC ($625) to send out 100 million of them. The people doing this seem to have slurped up all known addresses from/to which coins have ever been sent, and sent them this minuscule amount.
This information is in the public blockchain and open for all to see, by design, and there is nothing you can do to prevent receiving these transactions. At this point, there is no evidence of anything bad resulting from this, either at the individual level, or globally for Bitcoin.

The paper wallet contains the private keys so you don't need anything else. However, it is important to make reliable and durable backups of the paper wallet. What happens if you lose the paper wallet durr to theft or fire? What happens if you are incapacitated and your family needs to access the money?
My solution is to use bip38-encrypted paper wallet with a password that my wife knows well. This is backed up online.
We have an encrypted file with all our logins and passwords. The encryption password for this file is a 24-character string and 4 close relatives have 12 characters each so that any 3 can reconstitute the whole password (eg if the pw is abcdefghijkl, the parts are abcdgj, defahk, ghibel, jklcfi)

This is a layered problem. The lowest layer is, the protocol (and OpenSSL) leave it unspecified whether the signature in the transaction should be of fixed width (ie with leading 0s) or not. Thus, both forms of transactions are accepted by other nodes and clients as valid.
The next layer is software that uses the *hash* of the transaction to uniquely identify it. Thus, if one of the nodes forwards an alternative version of the transaction with the different hash, nodes will see multiple versions of the transaction as separate transaction and then add up to wrong balances.
The next layer up is client software that sees these mutated *unconfirmed* transactions and makes them appear spendable. This causes confusion because your spendable balance appears too high, and then you can get further transactions rejected as double-spends.
There are fixes necessary at each step, but it is important to realize that the actual integrity of transactions (a specific amount from a specific sending address to a specific receiving address) is never compromised.

You have a choice of having the seller deposit coins into your localbitcoins wallet, or if it's a face-to-face transaction, they can send the coins directly to your wallet (where you own the private key), and bypass the 1% localbitcoins fee. Of course you lose the escrow service but that's not an issue if it's a cash transaction and you verify that the transaction going into the seller's address has at least a couple of confirmations.
Also, I would only use multibit (or any other wallet) after I were very comfortable with backup and recovery. Make sure you know how to back up your wallet, keep 2 different (and geographically separate) copies of the wallet, and verify that you can successfully restore it.
I would advise using Electrum, which has a much simpler backup/recovery process.

Virtual means "having the same virtues or qualities as". So electronic money that you never touch is every bit as virtual as bitcoin. The problem isn't that it's wrong; it's that it's not descriptive enough. Most money we handle is already virtual - you never touch the real thing. And even the real thing is only real if you believe in it.
The right way to differentiate bitcoin from fiat money is by starting that it's a  decentralized digital peer to peer cryptographic currency.

When you are dealing with a reputable merchant, Bitcoin is better for both sides. The merchant saves 3-4% on credit card fees, and the buyer doesn't have to worry about stolen credit card numbers.

Here's something simpler. You're familiar with bitcoin code (including this mutability issue).
You own an exchange. You hire a bunch of support staff and give them instructions for handling cold-to-hot wallet refills without asking too many questions.
You put in code that does automated retries on "failed" transactions.
Then you slowly drain the cold wallet over a few months.
Finally, you make some lame moves to make it look like you're trying hard to salvage the situation, even going to the lengths of doing shady insider arbitrage with deposited btc against other exchanges.
Now you have half a billion dollars in BTC and plausible deniability.

Bitcoin is *not* anonymous, certainly not as far as Uncle Sam is concerned. It has pretty decent privacy in that a random person (or say a divorce lawyer) cannot get to one's bitcoins the way they can get to a bank account, say.
That said, there are plenty of people who are happy to buy bitcoins in a non-clandestine manner. If we make it easy for them to get bitcoins, it will only help the ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:17:36
Whatever value bitcoin has at a given moment, there is an incentive to acquire more by providing products and services. This incentive creates demand for bitcoins which are limited in quantity. That in turn provides an upward pressure on the dollar price.
This needs to be balanced by the downward pressure resulting from people wanting or needing to "cash out." As the ecosystem grows, this pressure well decrease and the price will find a balance at a higher level.

They can retrieve your private key, yes.
To prevent this loss, you can either use a dumb printer (ie not an office/network printer but one that you own that doesn't have a hard drive).
You can also use bip38 encryption to make your private key password protected, so that you would need both the private key and the password in order to spend the balance. You can use bitaddress.org to both generate and decrypt bip38 encrypted private keys. Mycelium on android also supports bip38 paper wallets.

BIP38 uses scrypt and sha256(sha256(bitcoin_address)) as the salt. This makes it resistant to cracking, because scrypt is cpu and memory intensive, and the salt makes it impossible to use rainbow tables.

2 MB was a band-aid more than a year ago (at the time Classic came out). Demand has already grown past that point. If you increase the block size to 2 MB today and fees drop to the point they were 18 months ago, 2 MB blocks will immediately fill up.
Not only has (latent) demand continued to grow, but technology has improved too. If we are to increase raw blocksize today, it would be better to go with 8 MB, and a planned doubling every 4 years at least for the next 3-4 halvings.

One frequently hears that contentious hard forks are dangerous. So where would you draw the line?
As far as the importance of miners' votes, the only other vote that non-miners have is the value they are prepared to offer to coins mined by miners. The most effective way for the economy to override miners is by buying (or refusing to buy) their coins. There is no other way, so when people say that miners cannot decide on a hard fork, they are only technically right because while only miners have the actual vote, that vote is completely influenced by economic concerns dictated by the economic majority.

Who's doing the allowing? Isn't bitcoin a permissionless network? Anyone can run a node and broadcast any random junk. Including blocks that most other nodes would consider invalid. The configuration parameters aren't the thing that allows it. And keeping those parameters from being configured in core isn't going to prevent it.
If the network does change parameters, wouldn't it be better that it does it with clearly established overwhelming consensus? That's all that the parameters do. They formalizes a mechanism for miners to tell other miners what constitutes good blocks. Something that they can already do through private channels if they wish.

When someone sends you a bitcoin, they say to the world "I own address 1FooBarWoof with 1 coin in it and I am sending 1 coin to your address 1StendhalProject, and I authenticate this by signing this message with my private key"
This proves to you that they are indeed the owners of the address. The problem is that they could turn around and broadcast a different transaction to my address, and both of us are convinced that we got 1 bitcoin from 1FooBarWoof, even though that address only contained 1 bitcoin to begin with. This is the double spending problem.
The Bitcoin protocol solves this problem by keeping all transactions in a public ledger called the block chain. You only trust the transaction if it makes it into the block chain before the other one. Only one of the 2 transactions can be included for the block to be valid.
 The way you keep the block chain healthy is by making miners prove that they spent a lot of computational effort to find a magic number that, when added to the block, satisfies a specific matematical relationship.
That's what your computer is doing - it is trying to find that magic number by trying lots of candidate values to see which one works. That's what every other miner is doing as well, and the first one to find the magic number gets the mining reward and gets to add the block to the block chain.
Note: it's a lot more complicated than that, this is just the high-level summary.

I bet you couldn't come up with a reasonable scenario in which BU would cause a 20 block reorg.

@_date: 2017-02-10 13:31:24
It's not BU that makes it so. It is Bitcoin. When you broadcast a transaction you cannot put preconditions on the eventual miner who confirms it (besides the transaction fee, of course). The only direct check against the miner is other miners who can orphan unacceptable blocks.
However, the market does have a role when the miner tries to cash in their block reward. If the economic majority disagrees with the miner, their mined coins lose value.

The typical arguments around centralization, like propagation delays, selfish mining etc are already being mitigated by xthin blocks, spy/head-first mining and so on.


OK, more like prepaid cards. From the user perspective, they are still paying into the system (at a hefty charge) and then using up credits over time.

But contentious is fine. Even if we concede the point, it doesn't change anything. The pro-scaling side is optimistic that more and more miners will run BU until we reach a tipping point and then the rest of the economy will follow (or get left behind on a minority chain that will wither away).

I am not overlooking that at all. Elsewhere, I've referred to this leading to a "suboptimal equilibrium" where demand grows to the point where fees grow too high, and then growth becomes stunted. I don't know what that equilibrium point is - $0.50 or $20 for a minimal transaction - but it will prematurely limit bitcoin's growth as you observed yourself. It sucks if fees rise too high, and it sucks if people stop using and recommending bitcoin.

The thing with fees is that once you are close to capacity, the relationship between demand and price is very non-linear.

LN will also increase pressure for centralization and need for trust. In fact, if the block size scales with technology, it will not cause any issues for on-chain decentralization whatsoever. With innovations like xthin blocks and flex trans, a lot of vulnerabilities like propagation delay and malleability can be eliminated. Oh, and "credits in a bank account" is exactly what LN is.
When blocks are not full, and transactions do not use RBF, zero-conf can be sufficiently low-risk for most applications. Just as counterfeit cash is a risk, the occasional double-spend will be a risk. But it will cost a lot to attempt a double-spend and the probability of success is low if you wait long enough.
We have not reached scaling limits and aren't close to reaching them. Bitcoin still has enough head room to keep growing for 15-20 years even if we double the number of users/transactions every year. Because technology doesn't remain still. If anything, the improvements accelerate over time.

1. Bitcoin/USD prices have always been volatile and are likely to remain so.
2. Bitcoin is going to be new and unfamiliar to most new users, who will form the bulk of the userbase if bitcoin is to grow.
3. Given 1 and 2, most of these users will not be willing to lock more than a handful of dollars in a channel at a time, say for 4-8 weeks.
4. If the fees to open a channel are more than a few cents, and need to be paid 6-12 times a year, they will amount to a large percentage (maybe 100% or more) of the value of the channel. If one has to pay a yearly fee of $20-50 on a prepaid card with $50-$100 on it, nobody will use such a payment method.
5. If a transaction cannot confirm on-chain reliably within a few minutes, most new users (whose use will be primarily impulsive) will not have the time or patience to go through a lengthy and uncertain channel set-up process involving RBF/CPFP, unpredictable high fees during peak periods and so on.

The number of transactions on a network are proportional to the **square** of the number of participants. LN reduces the load on the block chain so that now the number of block chain transactions only grows linearly.
Basically, N users interacting with a fixed fraction of N users gives you the quadratic growth. With LN, the N users only interact with one player (LN) as far as the block chain is concerned.

FTA: "If two miners merge their operations, they get the same expected return as if they mined on their own, but they obtain a return with a higher probability."
This makes no sense. Expected return is the same as the probability of obtaining a return times the amount of return. Remember that a new block is created every 10 minutes on average, so a large enough pool will always obtain a return with almost complete certainty over a period of a few hours.
Edit: I guess it makes sense if you read it as ".... they obtain a lesser return with a higher probability" but in that case that's a non-sequitur.

And that is precisely how it was designed by Satoshi. Miners aren't entitled to growing benefits just because bitcoin becomes more valuable.

If opening a LN channel in order to get on to the quick and cheap second layer system costs $10, most people will not bother.
Even if they did, the current capacity (times 2, assuming a generous segwit multiplier) would still severely limit the rate (and raise fees) at which channels can be opened and settled.
The right way is to scale both on-chain (at least a factor of 1000 over the next 10-20 years) and off-chain (maybe a factor of 100k, assuming a generous 100 off-chain transactions per on-chain transaction.)

Great article. Here's what I think about this comment:
It is true that the exchange rate of bitcoin is volatile, as indeed the article clearly mentions. It's not clear why that would cause a drop in the company's volume.
Bitcoin does not pay for utilities yet, but there are definitely places where you can use it to pay for gas groceries and rent. As the bitcoin economy grows, more and more of the financial transactions will be performed in bitcoin and there will be no need to convert to fiat for everyday transactions.
The comment about pandering and "everyone has a price" is confusingly offensive. It sounds like "bitcoin is bad, and you should feel bad," without any justification being offered for the claim. What is the exact argument being made here?
The last comment is just wrong. How does an accountant accepting bitcoin destroy people? Why is it irresponsible and short-sighted to promote something you are passionately involved in, in good faith and genuine involvement?
Bitcoin works for me, and if it works for people I do business with, then that is what matters. All this vague unsubstantiated criticism sounds more like sour grapes or fear of change than genuine concern for the well-being of some unidentified people you think bitcoin is going to destroy.

There's no doubt bitcoin is an attractive target for hackers. However, the best way to fight technology is with better technology. With multisig transactions, hardware wallets etc. we are slowly getting there. Still, the part that needs the most work is the UI/UX.

No, you wouldn't. It would cost you $20 to open a lightning network channel using an on-chain transaction. You would then keep the channel open for 4-8 weeks, which means you would pay $60 to $120 each year in fees.
Because of the volatility of the bitcoin price, and the newness of LN, it would be recommended to only lock up on the order of $100 at a time in a channel. Which means you could be paying more in fees each year than the amount in the channel.
With $100 in on-chain fees, pretty much no one is going to use LN. In most countries of the world $100 is a monthly salary.

I'd argue that "stop making very-low-value transactions" is the same as leaving the market. If you take away low value transactions, the only use cases left are a (very volatile) gold-like store of value, or international remittances which will require going through a fiat portal at either end (because the recipient cannot directly pay with bitcoin). Those are inherently very limiting on adoption and growth. Essentially, you will never close the loop if you cannot make small payments with bitcoin.

I wonder if a "swap-meet" would work for bitcoin, where people get together in a room and exchange bitcoins for bank transfers at the current market price.

@_date: 2017-02-07 14:47:09
My view on this has evolved. The portion that you bought as a long term (but risky) investment should absolutely be kept in cold storage for which you hold the private keys. However, pocket-change bitcoins that you intend to spend with merchants or send to friends should be kept on a trusted exchange or wallets like xapo or blockchain.info.
The reason for this is that centralized wallets can consolidate several transfers into fewer on-chain transactions and improve the usability of Bitcoin given the current at-capacity load on the network. Think of them as centralized layer 2 solutions. That's the best we can do until the scaling problem is solved.

I think miners are more thoughtful and more protective of their significant investments than you give them credit for.




BU itself says nothing about any 75% or other threshold. It just lets miners set their EB, AD and MG parameters, and observe those being signaled by other miners. It is a communication mechanism, not a consensus mechanism, but it can help bring about consensus.


I think we mostly agree. However, miners produce blocks, so they have to know what a good block is. That definition has to come from somewhere.
Faced with a chain split, a miner has to decide which block to build on. So in that situation at least, a miner has to exercise some judgment as to which one of two (if any) blocks is a good block.
In making that decision, they obviously have to be cognizant of whether the next miner will build on top of their block, and also whether users will buy their block reward coins. Those are the only ways in which the economic majority directly influences miner decisions.

The only real metric we have for the userbase is the number of transactions, and yes, block size will be more or less proportional to the number of transactions (not all transactions are the same size).
The number of transactions is likely to be proportional to the *square* of the number of users. I'm happy to pay with bitcoin as much as possible, so if the number of users increases by a factor of x then I have x times as many opportunities to pay by bitcoin (i.e. instead of r transactions, I can now make r\*x transactions), and so does each of the Cx users, so the total number of transactions is C\*r\*x^2

BU doesn't give any more power to miners than they already have, except to be able to communicate their EB/AD/MG parameters to other miners. It is a communication mechanism. It does not at any point automatically grow block sizes. Only a miner (mindful of consequences) can manually elect to push out a big block and hope that it will not be orphaned. In that it is no different than what they can do by recompiling core.


So first of all, bitcoin is permissionless. What you think miners shoudl or shoudln't do does not have any bearing on what miners choose to do (at their own peril, of course, but such is the nature of liberty).
Secondly, if you want to coordinate the rules, you need channels of communication in place. That is all that BU provides.


Bitcoin is open source. The configuration is already exposed (it's just a  constant in a header file). Miners are more careful and protective of their significant investments than you give them credit for. The idea that they will go against the economic majority and break consensus rules is just not credible.

Fortunately, bitcoin already has a mechanism to decide on whether a including a transaction is worth it: miners are the sole judges of whether to add a transaction to a block.

Long term is right. Payment channels are a long, long way off. And I don't mean technologically.
Think about your non-geeky friend, or maybe your parents, that you might have tried to introduce bitcoin to. It's cool, you put some bitcoin in their phone wallet, and then they can pay for coffee or xbox gold or something.
Now, imagine asking them to put their coins in a channel, sort of like a bank account, where it's locked for a few weeks and used like prepaid card. Except that there's anywhere from $1-$20 fee to charge the card. And you have to pay that fee every few weeks, to the point where it adds up to more than the fees on a credit card. It's just not going to work for them, unless pretty much every payment they make can be made with it.
And even then, given the volatility of the bitcoin/fiat exchange rate, they're only ever going to lock a few dollars at a time in the channel, which the high on-chain transaction fee makes very unattractive to begin with.
So the point is, that payment channels may work for some very limited use cases like micropayments for web content or even coffee, but only if on-chain scales to make fees very very small and confirmation very very reliable.

Beware the "Coffee on the Blockchain" trope.
When discussing on-chain scaling, we frequently hear the criticism that the bitcoin blockchain should not be used to record small transactions like buying a cup of coffee, and scaling on-chain capacity would mean all full nodes will be forced to process and store such trivial transactions for eternity. While there's some merit to this criticism, it is a bit of a red herring. This is not what the debate is about.
People in favor of on-chain scalability don't think you must put your coffee purchase on the block chain. They don't even think we should recommend it. They think that at this stage in bitcoin's development, making it possible to put coffee on the block chain will not hurt bitcoin, but refusing to scale blockchain capacity will *kill* bitcoin.
Even if LN happens (and I for sure hope it does, soon), unless costs to open an LN channel are in the 1-2 cent range, new users will not use it for every-day payments. They will not use bitcoin either. They will just go somewhere else.
But if we can get capacity up to keep up with current demand and technological improvements, then LN becomes an attractive proposition to a huge percentage of the population of earth, and that's how Bitcoin goes to the Moon.

It exists because people disagree with the ideas coming out of Core, not the personalities.

Elasticity of demand refers to the fact that demand decreases in response to an increase in price. If this is true, we will hit a suboptimal equilibrium at low adoption levels. If it is false, then transactions will take much longer to confirm, and some will never confirm because the queues will keep growing longer.
Both situations are undesirable. Adding a known unknown (what will happen with LN) to the mix doesn't inspire much confidence either.
There's also the confusing argument I have heard, which is that increased fees are needed to support miners, but then LN is needed to decrease the number of transactions mined (and hence the fees paid to miners).

Actually, 45,000 in storage per node, say once every 5 years, times say 10k nodes to secure the network, would be $90M/year in storage costs.
A TPS that is 500k x today's TPS translates to 2M TPS, or about 170 billion txns per day. These would have to be overwhelmingly automated transactions rather than human-created. If the price grows linearly with the TPS, we're looking at $500M/BTC in 20 years. Even if it grows as SQRT(TPS), it's still $700k / BTC, for a market value of USD 15 trillion. So the storage cost would be a pretty good deal given the size of the economy.
Even assuming the price only doubles with each halving, that would be USD 32,000 / BTC, which equates to USD 600B in total value. $90M/year to secure an economy that size doesn't seem like a bad deal either. 
I guess the takeaway from this post is: don't be afraid of growth. It's a nice problem to have.

If bitcoin manages to attract a billion people, and they all use LN, and only open and close one channel each month, and perform no other transactions besides those 2 on the block chain, we will still need 2 B txns/month x 225 bytes/tx / 144 blocks/day / 30days/month = 100 MB blocks.
If blocks cannot scale, we're not going to support a billion users, even with LN.

But this isn't just an argument. It is an actual release of code which will likely lead to a spin-off of the blockchain. Because there is no coercion in bitcoin, anyone at any time is free to release such code, and no one is obliged to run one or the other fork.
Given this scenario, it is entirely up to the participants in the economy to assign whatever value they perceive is best, and bid/ask accordingly for coins on each branch following the spin-off. Furthermore, this is the *only* choice each of us has, given that we cannot force developers to withdraw their respective code change proposals.

Paradoxically, the opposite is true, as long as miners only include fee-paying transactions. A person willing to pay fees to fill up blocks and slow everyone else down will do that regardless of the actual blocksize. However, the number of spam transactions they will have to send is *much higher* if the block size limit is higher.
If you wanted to bring traffic on a road to a stand-still, it is much easier to block just 1 or 2 lanes than it is to block 16 lanes.

If we assume the premise of a spam attack, and blocks would otherwise only be 90% full, then with double the block size, spam would have to increase from 100 kB to 1.1 MB to fill up 2MB blocks. That's 11 times more expensive for the spammer.
In any case, even if blocks were only 90% full *today* the trend is that they will be constantly full in the next few weeks.

You don't need to "create" a fee market - it already exists. Miners already prioritize transactions by fees. They have the complete choice to include a transaction or not.
What we don't need is a rigged fee market, where the supply is constrained by some arbitrary limit, whereas the demand is only constrained by the price.
A rigged market is inefficient (cf Venezuela), and against the very spirit of bitcoin as a permissionless peer-to-peer electronic cash.

The attack assumes that the miner is creating fake transactions (with or without fees) in order to make blocks bigger. Other miners will only be leaving money on the table if they are ignoring fee-paying transactions other than their own. If such transactions do take up more room than the block these miners are willing to mine, then they do deserve to lose that money. Also, lots of demand is a nice problem for the bitcoin ecosystem to have. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 15:19:05

This is only true if there are sufficient legitimate fee-paying transactions (ie those not created by the miner themselves) to fill larger blocks. In that case, the health of the bitcoin economy requires that we accomodate all such transactions. That, however, is a nice problem to have.

Think of it as a special type of box and keys. Each box has a key slot to lock or unlock it. Keys always come in pairs - think of them as the red key and the blue key. So you have the key pairs {A_red, A_blue}, {B_red, B_blue}, etc.
You can lock a box with whichever key you grab. However, once it's locked with some key, only the other key from the same pair can unlock it. So if you lock a box with the key B_blue, ONLY the key B_red can unlock it.
Now you can use a bunch of these boxes to send secret and authenticated messages. To achieve this, everyone in the world publishes their name and the picture of their blue key in a public newspaper. The red key, on the other hand, is kept hidden from public view. Then, if Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob, she can simply make a copy of Bob's blue key, and lock the message in a box with Bob's blue key and send it to Bob.
Only Bob's red key can now open the box, so the contents are hidden from the rest of the world.
If Bob also needed to make sure that the message in fact came from Alice, then Alice could first lock the message in a box with her Red key, and then put that box inside another box locked with Bob's blue key.
Bob can now be sure the message came from Alice, because only Alice's blue key (which he can find in the public registry) can open the inner box.

The solutions like xthin and flextrans are not theoretical. They are not production ready (because that involves a long integration process) but they have actually been demonstrated to work.
The reason segwit isn't as attractive is because it's a one-and-done hack. It doesn't benefit all transactions equally. In particular, it benefits the most common transaction (1 input, 2 outputs) far less than contrived n-of-n multisig transactions. A raw 4MB block will have 2-3 times as many transactions as a 4 MB segwit block. And in a year's time, when we hit the limit again, segwit will have nothing more to offer.

Because it has to be done on the blockchain. The blockchain has limited capacity as is painfully obvious. With a 100x growth in adoption, if every person uses bitcoin only to open one LN channel a few times a year, there wouldn't be enough capacity, and fees would rise astronomically.
Also, if fees don't rise, people will have an incentive to send on-chain transactions directly instead of having to lock money in the channel for several weeks. THis would exacerbate the transaction load until fees rise to compensate for it.

Depends on who's practicing it, and on who's dime. The government cannot discriminate against a minority (including the smallest minority of all, i.e. the individual) even if the majority are in favor. The difference between bitcoin and government is that the latter has a monopoly on the use of force, whereas the former is a purely voluntary system.
A private individual has no such constraint, and may discriminate against any one, for any reason (and bear the consequences), as long as  that individual does not use force or fraud.


And that is a good thing, because it keeps them in line with what that greater community actually wants. If miners unilaterally decided to change the protocol without the majority of the community agreeing, then they risk losing their investment immediately (because no one will accept the bitcoins they mine), or over a short term (because bitcoin as a whole loses value due to the loss of confidence).

We are already addressing those. With xthin/compact blocks. With flextrans. With each generation of technological improvements and falling costs (every 12-18 months).

Technology is always a game of pushing against the limits. If there were no limits, there would be no need to improve technology. Conversely, if we don't push boundaries of technology, then we are doomed to live with existing limits, worsening quality and higher prices.

The question is, what is the bare minimum value needed for security. If the amount of securities transactions that rely on the blockchain is in the trillions, but the mining difficulty is low as a result of the low reward, then the incentive to subvert those transactions using dishonest nodes is strong, while the means will be relatively cheap.
This alone will not provide an incentive to keep the price of bitcoins high, but it will dissuade the likes of Nasdaq from relying too much on the blockchain.
Alternatively, exchanges might come up with a private blockchain with trusted nodes, which bypasses bitcoin altogether.

It's a change to the bitcoin protocol that marks a transaction as revocable. Once a transaction is so marked, it can be replaced by the sender with a transaction with different amounts, inputs and outputs, any time until it is confirmed.
The sender chooses to set the RBF flag on a transaction; the only choice the recipient has is to notice the flag and decide on whether and when to credit the sender.

Here's the problem: there's one bus going from point A to point B once every 10 minutes, and it can carry 20 people. As long as the long term rate of people joining the queue remains less than 2 per minute, every one has a good chance of getting on the bus. If someone is in a hurry, they can pay a premium to cut to the front of the line, but everyone gets to ride. Your service becomes popular and attracts more and more riders.
What happens when the number of people wanting to ride rises to more than 2 per minute and persists at that high level? The queue grows without limit. There's a temporary scramble to pay higher and higher amounts to get on the next bus, but some people will never ever get on the bus.
Will they stay forever patiently in line? No, they will just give up and call for a taxi. And now your bus service is limited to ferrying just 20 people every 10 minutes, while a competent taxi operator can scale better than you, charge lower prices and faster service, and eventually even those 20 people will just use the taxi because it has become the better option over time.
You have 2 possible solutions: One is to build a monorail track that will take a couple of years to be ready and can ferry hundreds of people instead of 20, and the other is to use a bigger bus that can carry twice as many people. Something you can do today. Would you really risk losing out all that traffic just because someone has promised to complete the monorail in 2 years time, and also claimed that all riders will love it, without any evidence to support such a claim?

@_date: 2017-03-22 15:55:57
Yes, I could have been clearer. The answer to "is it theft?" depends on who you are asking. If you are asking just the bitcoin network, then the answer is no, as long as the transaction (and the blocks it is confirmed in) are valid. Outside of the network, other considerations can and do come into play. At times it may be impossible to prove, for example with a weak brainwallet passphrase.
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:32:39

"start planning a safe hardfork"
That's the problem right there. We've been having this debate for years now, and every proposal to increase the block size has gone exactly nowhere, whether from the outside (i.e. XT, classic) or from within core (e.g. the HK agreement).
If core were to actually propose such an increase now, and actually include it in the code with an activation date a few months down, it would see significant support. However, it is clear from past performance that no such increase will ever be forthcoming from the team in charge of the dominant node software.

Until recently, I was running a full node on a 2007 vintage *laptop (Dell XPS M13, running Ubuntu). Now, this is with 1 MB blocks, but the point is that 8 year old laptop hardware (not server) is able to keep up with today's bitcoin bandwidth.

Did you know that in order to support 1 billion users, opening one LN channel on payday and closing it a month later, and doing nothing else on the blockchain, will require the *average* block-size to be 90 MB, and if everyone does that on the same day, say the first of each month, then on that day the block size would need to be 2.7 GB?
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:13:28
All I'm saying is that the bitcoin protocol only cares about the private key. If we change this we affect fungibility (e.g. tainting, blacklisting etc.)
That doesn't mean bitcoins cannot be stolen. If there is evidence that the private key itself was stolen (like passwords can be stolen) then that's still theft.

People can argue principles, priorities, even perceived facts. I don't understand how people can argue math: if transactions are created faster than they can be confirmed, then the backlog will grow without limit.
If we go with LN, and a billion people open and close one channel each month, we will need ~90 MB blocks just for those transactions, which *have* to live on the block chain.
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:41:42

@_date: 2016-03-08 12:55:16
I looked at my credit card statement last month, and it has ~20 transactions. Add another 10 transactions (eg bank transfers, cash etc.). So that's 30. Assuming I'm average (modest, I know), and we grow to a billion users making 30 bitcoin transactions a month each, our TPS will be 30 billion / (30 x 86400) =~ 10,000 transactions/sec.
If we assume a minimal transaction size of 220 bytes, we need 2.2 MB x 600 = 1.32 GB/block.
Now, if all those 30 transactions move to LN, and are replaced by one txn for opening an LN channel and one for closing it (so 2/month), we then have a TPS of just 667, and an average block size of 90 MB.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:48:04
That's an interesting question. The protocol itself defines ownership solely though the possession of the private key. As far as the network is concerned, a transaction is valid if it has a valid signature.
Now, if there is other circumstantial evidence (e.g. that points to a computer break-in or a breach of contract or failure to secure customer funds by an exchange) that might well be considered theft by a court of law.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:11:19

Hi Jesse, thanks for doing the AMA. What are your thoughts on the ability and ethics of an exchange cutting in on trades? For example, if there are limit sell orders on the books at $403 and $401, and someone enters a market buy, couldn't the exchange step in to pick up the $401 order itself, then enter a $402 sell order, and finally execute the market buy at $402, thereby pocketing the difference? In the absence of regulation and oversight, how can traders trust exchanges to be impartial?
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:34:44
So you're making 2 different points:
1. Have to pay 0.0002 instead of 0.0001 in fees: true, this is not a big deal, but only as long as it stops there. If blocks remain full and transaction backlog keeps increasing, fees will also keep increasing until people give up using bitcoin.
2. The current influx of transactions is a spam attack: If these transactions include fees, then they are valid and miners have the right to include them, or not. The bigger picture though, is that even if you took out one particular set of transactions because they are spam, the recent trend shows that organic growth is about to hit the capacity limit anyway. Once that happens, the transaction backlog increases without limit and so do transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:19:16
Until last year, blocks were less than full. Yet miners required fees (though much lower than today).
The main reason why miners will make more is that with high fees and fixed block size, there is no more room to grow, whereas with a dynamic block size and low fees, a lot more people will be attracted to bitcoin.
Big blockers are not opposed to layer-2 solutions. Indeed, for most transactions they will be better than on-chain because of instant confirmations. But even layer-2 requires layer-1 to get on to first, and the block size will limit how many channel-open transactions can happen in any given time frame.
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:02:46
The probability that the other chain will regain hash power (in the absence of major show-stopper issues that become apparent only after the fork) is vanishingly small. Why would miners shoot themselves in the foot by provoking a huge crisis of confidence?
What will actually happen is that the minority chain will instantly become useless. I, and most others, will be actively shuffling our corecoins back and forth between our addresses to overload the minority chain and eliminate its utility. The big blocks chain will be immune to such attacks because it can always make room for more transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-17 17:14:27
The problem is that there is no government protection for this rent-seeking monopoly, and the barriers to entry are very very low.

@_date: 2017-03-12 21:29:12
It depends a lot on the recipient. If you are sending bitcoin to someone, that someone will have to tell you on which chain to send the coins. If you are receiving, you have to decide. Chances are it will be pretty clear within a few dozen blocks following the fork where the hash power is at.
To be sure, you could even ask to be sent coins on both chains, i.e. only coins from before the fork. But it will take a very long time to confirm the transaction on the minority chain.

It is incorrect to state that miners aren't adopting segwit because the block-size increase would lower fees too much. In fact, the too-small block-size increase coupled with the push to lightning is one of the major things that miners don't like.
Now, if you made blocks a lot bigger (like 4-8 MB now, and growing yearly by some factor), then there will be more on-chain transactions, and even if per-transaction fees go down, overall miners will make as much money if not more.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:58:11
If you couldn't withdraw coins from the exchange, or spend the coins that you already have (because fees cost more than the value of your UTXOs, and even then it would take a week or a month to confirm) would you buy more coins?
If you were a miner on the minority chain and couldn't spend the mining reward for a week while markets are in a flux, would you continue to mine?

I somehow doubt that people in a hypercompetitive, incorruptible business such as mining, with total revenues of USD 1.8 MM per day, razor-thin margins, months-long planning horizons, and the need for constant fine grained cost-benefit adjustments are "not technical." They have the most at stake out of all Bitcoin business out there. They are very smart, very dedicated, and know a lot more about Bitcoin technology and economics than most people on this sub.

@_date: 2017-03-09 08:54:21
Even if they are combined, if the per-byte incremental cost of adding another UTXO is greater than the value of the UTXO, it still loses money.
If you had $1000 spread across 2000 addresses, it would cost you more than $1000 to send a transaction combining those 2000 addresses into a single one.
There used to be a workaround for this, which was to let the coins age a bit and then age priority would reduce (or even eliminate) the fees required. This doesn't work any more because of the backlog and because core removed it explicitly.

As for the proof of passport, wasn't this just a brainstorming idea to solve the problem of Sybil attacks, by verifying that one node matches one legally unique, difficult-to-forge token? And furthermore it involves uses zero-knowledge proofs, which means that the actual passport details are never revealed to the network?

Yes, but it's complicated. Immediately after the fork, if you broadcast a transaction, it will be valid on both chains. IN fact, if you broadcast a transaction with pre-fork inputs at any time after the fork, it will be valid on both chains. However, if it is confirmed on one chain but not yet on another, any subsequent transactions spending its outputs will only be valid on the chain where it's confirmed. Also, if any of your inputs can be traced back to the mining reward on one of the chains, it will be invalid on the other chain.

The most efficient market (ie one that provides the fairest benefits to all participants) is a free market. A free market is where the supply side has the flexibility to choose both the asking price and the supply volume, and the demand side has the flexibility to choose both the bid price and the demand size.
A non-free market is one where one or more of those parameters are constrained artificially (i.e., for a reason not inherent to the existence of the market).

The support is in the form of mining blocks, so you have to put your megawatts where your mouth is.

They way the economics and game theory will play out is that at 25% hash rate, the minority fork will only push out one block every 40 minutes. But the backlog won't go anywhere. If anything, it will increase as people try to move their coins to exchanges etc. Which means most transactions will wait many times longer (maybe even days) than currently. The backlog, the minority status and the majority fork's ability to move coins fast would move the economic value to the majority fork very quickly.
A small risk of wipeout remains, so it is judicious to stamp it out as quickly as possible.

Every choice has a cost, and if there's spam, miners will raise fees and nodes will filter out transactions that fit certain criteria. Clearly people who run BU nodes want big blocks, and more bandwidth utilization comes with the territory.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:01:27
the fees would be denominated in core coins and would not necessarily be worth more in purchasing power. Miners would not be able to spend their coins for a week after mining them (because that's how long it would take to mine 100 blocks on the minority chain), which would further discourage them from continuing to mine.
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:51:21
If bitcoin transactions cost 1 cent each, and there were a billion users, how many pennies would they want to spend making bitcoin transactions? I posit that it is not infinite, but in fact quite limited. People are not going to move bitcoin from one address to another just for fun (maybe if the fee is zero). They will only use transactions for valid economic reasons. And we should encourage this.
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:28:18
This idea that if the blocksize can be changed then so can the block reward is not credible. Of course miners are free to mine blocks with arbitrary rewards, and nodes are free to run software that recognizes or rejects any blocks.
The genious of Satoshi's invention is the alignment of incentives across all participants: if miners violate rules that the market values, then they don't get paid.
And by the way, if some day there is a hard fork that changes the block reward, and it *is* accepted by the market (as evidenced by the price of the resulting inflationcoin and the hash rate behind it), then all of our ranting against it will not make an iota of difference. It will just happen, even if us smart people unanimously agree that it is a bad idea.

If you send change from a spend to a new address, that links (with some probability) your old address to your new address.
If you receive money from the same sending address into 2 receiving addresses, that establishes the sender as a common element between the 2 receiving addresses. Even if the sending addresses are different, if they come from the same entity, an investigation can uncover the link.
If your wallet consolidates funds from the 2 addresses when sending a new transaction, that establishes the link between those two addresses.

The assumption that people only spend bad money and hoard good money is wrong. If there were a guarantee of perpetual appreciation against fiat, then hoarding might make sense. But bitcoin is extremely volatile and likely to remain so.
What gives bitcoin value is its utility as permissionless peer to peer electronic cash. More adoption will push its value higher, but only as long as it actually remains usable.

The premise of the question was that bitcoin is still relevant decades from now, when the reward drops to single digits. If the price crashes, there won't be many transactions being sent, and not much work for miners to do. They will just stop adding capacity in response to the price, the difficulty will adjust, and the network will continue to work (though no one will care).
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:19:47
Which do you think is more likely - that bitcoin bandwidth use will grow suddenly from 3 tps to 1000 tps and kill all the nodes, or that increasing network capacity now will kick the can down the road sufficiently for other off-chain scaling solutions to actually be ready to take up the extra load?

Block size limit != block size. What you are proposing is functionally equivalent to removing the block size limit entirely, and letting miners decide which transactions they mine, depending on the transaction fees or any other criteria they choose. I like what you are proposing!
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:51:08
I actually agree with a lot of core developers, that in fact the miners won't decide, not on their own anyway. They, like all other participants in the market, will vote with their actions. If their actions are aligned with the majority, they will prevail. Otherwise they will fail.
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:34:03
Do you know what else is essential for the bitcoin ecosystem? Confidence. For people to feel secure using bitcoin, they need to have the confidence that their transactions will make it through, that transaction fees will be economical (competitive with other cryptos, if not banks and paypal), and predictable. There needs to be confidence that a denial-of-service hack will be so expensive as to be infeasible for ordinary hackers.
Full blocks with very limited space put all of these in jeopardy. If "legitimate" demand is 0.9MB but blocks were 8x larger, and miners were still charging fees (why wouldn't they?),  it would cost the hacker not just 7x, but possibly 70x more to launch their spam attack in order to take up the slack and cause blocks to be full.

Quadratic hashing is fixed by flexible transactions. (BIP 134)
Malleability is also fixed by flexible transactions.
If a hard fork increases block sizes (not just the block size limit) it will be because the bitcoin economy is growing, and more participants are entering the market. That would mean more nodes, not fewer.
If the economy is growing, it means higher price per bitcoin, not lower.
If there is a hard fork with 2 different chains, users have coins on both chains. No coins are lost.
@_date: 2017-01-24 15:40:27
The right way to solve complex engineering problems is by decomposing them into simpler subproblems, finding clean solutions to each subproblem, and then integrating the solutions to test everything together.
So, we can solve blocksize by increasing the constant. We can solve quadratic hashing and malleability with BIP 134 (flextrans), and we can solve propagation latency issues with xthin blocks. Then we put all of these together and test them under all possible scenarios to make the case for all participants to adopt this solution.

You can spend bitcoin (with the expectation that it will appreciate against something else like gold or fiat) and still be rational. For instance, if what you are buying is more immediately valuable, like food or a home or a business investment.
Or, if spending bitcoin is better than spending fiat, e.g. for international or private payments over the internet, or if the seller provides a discount for using bitcoin instead of credit cards.
You can also spend bitcoin without parting with it. I do it all the time. I use bitcoin for purchases, then buy it back right away. It improves the utility of bitcoin by acting as an efficient payment mechanism, and I can still own as many as I always did.
Before bitcoin, I spent my valued USD or EUR or whatever, but then I earned more and saved more and ended up having more and more each month. Was that irrational?
If everyone acted rationally by your definition and didn't part with their bitcoins (not even to trade in exchange for fiat) then bitcoin's value will be meaningless.

The incentives for running a full node do not include transaction fees - those are for miners only.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:55:52
Depending on support from exchanges, payment processors and other applicable proxies for user acceptance, the third option is that the network will converge because it is in the miners' self interest to mine on the chain with more proof of work if it also has support from buyers of their block reward. If that happens, the minority chain will wither on the vine - it will see its confirmation times grow to years from 10 minutes and will either become worthless or will be forced to hard fork to adjust difficulty.
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:45:06

Here's proof that you can delay a transaction forever by paying for just one transaction.
Assume block capacity of 10 transactions, a mempool of 10, and an incoming transaction rate of 10 every block interval. Each transaction pays the max fee from the previous block to assure confirmation, which is currently 10 cents. Every transaction gets confirmed in the immediate next block.
Then I send one transaction with an 11 cent fee. This displaces one transaction paying 10 cents. Every subsequent transaction that arrives pays 11 cents to ensure inclusion.
The 10c transaction never gets confirmed.
@_date: 2017-01-25 10:46:32
At the time they sent the transaction, they were paying the highest recommended fee for next block inclusion. Isn't this what we're advising people to do if they want their transactions to confirm quickly?

Consensus doesn't emerge from signaling. Signaling is used for synchronization as the mechanism to arrive at consensus, not to determine the state of that consensus.
Consensus emerges from each market participant looking at the state of the market (including the blocks being generated), and making their own choices that are likely to most benefit them. The price of stocks, gold, even the availability and price of uber rides etc are all determined using this mechanism.

This is rent-seeking, a trait of established sclerotic monopolies, not innovative disruptors. Disruptive technologies don't go all "we cannot scale, so we're just going to limit demand by raising prices."   If we allow prices to rise in response to increasing demand while strangling the supply, we will reach a premature equilibrium where user growth will just stop and even reverse.

It is not advisable to have all your coins in one address if you care about privacy. For now, if you have all your coins in one address, your next transaction should be able to send change to a different address and you can stop using that address altogether.
If you do have old coins from various sources at that one address, I would suggest sending them to an exchange and then withdrawing them so that their history becomes opaque to all private third parties.

There are interesting technical solutions to this problem, some of which have already been deployed in alternative clients. Basically, they avoid broadcasting transactions when a block is found because those transactions have already been broadcast before. So all you need to broadcast is a transaction hash that can be substantially smallar than the transaction itself. This drastically reduces the latency and bandwidth needs of block propagation.

@_date: 2017-01-24 16:05:10
Running a node is costly, so only those with money at stake will be properly incentivized to run full nodes. As the number of participants increases (businesses, richer users) and as technology gets cheaper, this number will increase. Otherwise bitcoin has bigger scaling problems than just the number of volunteer nodes.
No one wants to force a "contentious" hard fork at 51%. Miners invest a lot in mining blocks, and I don't see them risking their megawattage on blocks likely to be orphaned. All that BU does is it lets nodes and miners set parameters that reduce this risk and allow bitcoin to scale when ready. 
If a big block is pushed that is not supported by 49% of miners, it will have a pretty good chance of being orphaned, as long as the accept-depth on other nodes is sufficiently high (e.g. 6).

It is demonstrably not true that miners will include free transactions if there's room. Until last week blocks were frequently not full and yet a fee was required.

This is a total, and probably intentional, mischaracterization. Peter R was saying that the fixed supply is not a "central property" of bitcoin, which is to say the network will still continue to work through blocks, proof-of-work, difficulty etc even if you alter the award amount in all nodes. He may well believe in the need for some inflation, as Core's Peter Todd does, but you cannot infer that from the quoted tweet, and certainly not from the BU source code.

I think the incentives of miners and users are more aligned than you seem to assume. Miners are obviously interested in growing the size of the ecosystem because it makes their block rewards more valuable, and users want the same thing because it makes bitcoin more valuable and practical.
Miners wouldn't fill up blocks with free transactions because that costs them resources without providing any return. Thus, actual block sizes (not the limit) would be determined by the supply/demand price dynamics between user transactions and miner fees.
On the other hand, artificial scarcity in transaction capacity makes it easy and very cheap for spammers to fill up the tiny blocks and drive up costs and confirmation times. Transaction costs as a function of the incremental costs of a spam transaction is a super-linear relationship. When blocks are mostly empty, adding a spam transaction doesn't change transaction costs at all, but as blocks become close to full, each new fee-paying "spam" transaction drives up the transaction costs for the whole network by a much larger amount.
Having a larger blocks size limit, while still having miners who require transaction fees, makes a spam attack far, far more expensive, and hence improves the security of the whole network.

Maintaining reliability, availability (and reputation for those things) is extremely important as well, and at this very early stage, it is quite possible to keep up with the growth in interest using on-chain scaling. As soon as sidechains etc are available as solid turn-key solutions, demand will naturally gravitate towards them.
There are several examples where technologies have pushed for incremental improvements until alternatives became viable: CPU clock speeds increased for several generations until multi-core became possible. Hard drives crammed more data onto each square millimeter until SSDs came along. Phone and cable signaling rates have steadily improved since the days of 9.6kbits/sec on the same physical pipes, and fiber has only recently become somewhat widespread. Automakers kept pushing internal combustion engine efficiency until electric cars became a realistic proposition. Oncologists keep using marginally better chemo and radiation treatments each year and eke out better survival rates, while novel personalized, immune-system based, genetic or virally delivered treatments come of age.
We should not deprecate incremental evolution while waiting for quantum revolution.

The $5 USD to $10 USD per transaction figure is not an actual cost. It is the amount of dilution that is imposed on all holders regardless of whether they transact or not. The actual cost is the marginal cost (i.e. the cost of making a new transaction on top of the transactions already being made on the network).

Demand for fee-paying transactions, even at a penny per, is definitely not unlimited. It is not even very high. In any case, the interests of the nodes and miners are aligned here. Miners will drop spam transactions even if the developers don't hardcode the supply restrictions.
@_date: 2016-12-07 00:25:51
I'm arguing that the protocol cannot distinguish between spam and non-spam in the way that you have previously tried to do. As such, a block size limit is also unable to filter them. It will penalize "legitimate" transactions as well as "spam" transactions. Worse, because if the block size limit is close to the "legitimate" payload, it only takes a small amount of spam to fill up the blocks, drive up fees, and make confirmation times extremely unpredictable. SO it's the opposite of what you think I"m arguing.
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:25:40
Nobody is going to be deprived of their bitcoin (or the ability to send and receive bitcoin). The value of bitcoin comes from this irrevocability.
There is value to running your own node, but only in relation to the cost of running it. If your costs happen to be too large, you will be better off turning down your node. But that will not hurt the rest of the network (especially if better, faster nodes prop up elsewhere), and it will never ever deprive you of your bitcoins.

Well then enlighten me. I've been having a conversation under the premise that Marx advocated total state ownership (or even ownership by the proles) of the means of production, with no private individual economic freedoms whatsoever. He also predicted that the bourgeoisie will die out, with the world split between the capitalists and proles, and the latter will somehow, eventually, get rid of the former. In fact, the opposite has now happened in free countries, with the educated middle class in the service sector vastly outnumbering both blue-collar workers and the super-rich. The vast, vast majority of the domestic product in free countries comes from private enterprise, and the government is merely a drag on free enterprise.
So tell me again, what you think I don't know the meaning of?

That doesn't explain much. As I see it, every country that implemented Marx's ideas failed. Free market capitalism has been the greatest wealth creating system in the history of mankind, which has lifted billions out of poverty, brought about unprecedented peace among trading nations, and left countries with state ownership of all production so far in the dust it's not even funny. Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea - all of these countries have the least industry, a lot of poverty, and also the least individual freedoms.

If fees for on-chain transactions decrease, then people will use on-chain instead of tying up their money in LN channels. That in turn will cause fees to increase if the block size is artificially capped.
Bitcoin is permissionless, so people will use it for whatever reason, idealistic or not. If not enough people use it because of high fees, even LN will not help bitcoin grow and it will eventually become obscure and irrelevant.
If you look at exchange volumes right now, bitstamp and kraken are seeing less than a hundred coins traded during *most* hours. The price right now could just be a speculative bubble fueled by China. We ought to improve bitcoin fundamentals before it goes down as fast as it went up recently.

I know little about the philosophical foundations or the technical details of female genital mutilation, but I am convinced it's evil. Socialism to me is similar. It's cutting off a critical element of what is good in society - unfettered individual liberty. It professes to do that through the use of government force against the individual (even when it's in the name of equality or whatever). That alone makes it evil, regardless of the technicalities of the differences between socialism A and socialism B.
@_date: 2016-11-16 08:17:08
OK, so may be complaining about how high the fee is isn't the main concern. What concerns me is that it is a symptom of how cheaply an attacker can fill up blocks and cause fees to rise quickly, and also cause confirmation times to become very unpredictable. To me that is a vulnerability that can harm the reputation of bitcoin, limit its growth, and ultimately create openings for competitive offerings.
@_date: 2016-11-27 10:44:13
You're right. If we don't constrain supply and instead let miners and users determine prices through a supply/demand equilibrium, then prices will fall to zero.

As a node, once you set parameters that seem safe to you, you don't even see a fork, you just see a longest chain of valid blocks that happen to be big.

From the rbitcoin perspective on bigblockers, the bigblockers are trying to sabotage bitcoin by pushing for changes that will lead to miner centralization.
From the reverse direction, it is core that is trying to destroy bitcoin by refusing to make incremental scaling improvements, adding technical debt and pushing for layer 2 solutions that will lead to gateway centralization.
Some people say that non-core developers who want to build their own node software risk breaking bitcoin, while others say that having a single body of developers centralizes control over the protocol and is unhealthy.
It is possible that some of those allegations are true, and moreover, that the actors are driven not by self-interest, not by their love of bitcoin, however misguided, but by a secret anti-bitcoin agenda.

Value increases because a trade was recorded at that higher value, so someone bought and someone sold. 
It cannot rise to infinity and no one can guarantee the point at which it will stop rising, so as it rises, it can actually become riskier to hold it and people will try to rebalance.

Letting a very wide range of people use the blockchain, even at medium fees can only be done by allowing block size limits to grow with demand, or at least with technology improvements.

Anyone who has a significant amount of value in bitcoin has an incentive to run a full node, especially if we do a good job of informing everyone why they should run a node. Individuals in most countries with large numbers of bitcoiners have machines with 2-year-old cpus and hard drives and 10 MB/sec bandwidth. With that, they can easily run a full node until the current generation hardware becomes cheap as chips in a couple of years.
As for "if enough people have one," it would be nice if enough people had skin in the game to begin with. And the only way to get there is to scale bitcoin rapidly over the next few iterations of technological improvements.

I'll let BU experts comment authoritatively, but I don't think this is true. If you accept some big blocks and then decide you want to be on the small blocks chain after all, logically, you should throw away everything starting from the first big block you downloaded, and then follow the longest small-block chain from that point on, assuming someone is still mining down that fork.

All parties concerned have to do the calculations of the risks and rewards. Once the chain appears to have forked (i.e. there are simultaneously 2 competing chains of say 3-4 blocks), you (the sender) now have coins on both chains, and you could potentially spend them once on each chain.
Because of the way BU is designed, you cannot actually specify to your wallet which chain you prefer. You would need to work with a miner to mine your transaction without publishing it (though once a BU miner gets wind of it they will try to mine it as well, in order to get the comissions on the BU chain.
But this is fine because only one chain is going to win and the other will go away very shortly.
As the recipient things are a bit more tricky during the fork. You would need to make sure that the incoming transaction is spending UTXOs on the chain that you care about. If these are pre-fork coins then that's not a problem. But if they have only been confirmed on one of the 2 chains, then you might want to wait to see if that chain actually wins out.
As a miner, you would want to mine the chain that you think will win out over the long term, because otherwise you will just waste your megawatt hours and depreciating capital. Because of this, all miners will quickly pick a winner and only mine on the winning chain, with the losing chain dying out quickly due to starvation.

It increases transaction capacity by up to a factor of 1.7 if certain conditions are met (most transactions must be multisig, all wallets must use segwit etc.) It only does that once, whereas with a flexible limit we can keep bumping the baseline block size limit to keep pace with cpu, memory, storage and network improvements.

1. The block reward schedule is inviolate by economic consensus. It is part of the definition of bitcoin as commonly understood by everyone.
2. BU does not modify the block reward, the difficulty, or the proof-of-work constraints.
3. It is nevertheless true that bitcoin is what is accepted by the entire network by majority consensus, and there is nothing preventing a miner from broadcasting a block that modifies the block reward, for example. It is almost certainly guaranteed to be rejected by the rest of the miners and hence orphaned, but it is conceivable that the majority miners will build on top of it and thus change the 21M limit. Note that this is as much true of core as of BU.
4. If there are any simplifications or assumptions that went into the transaction fee vs block reward vs mining cost calculations that show how BU is not harmful to the network, then those are worth examining critically. Note that price has consistently at least doubled around each of the previous halvings, and given how small the bitcoin economic footprint is, it could plausibly continue to double over the next several halvings (ie 16-32 years) at least.

A check by definition is an instruction to the sender's bank to move sender's funds to whoever presents the check. It is meaningless "without using or involving a bank."

First of all, I am not OP, I just tried to paraphrase what (as I understood) OP said. Secondly, which of these is false:
1. Fees for on-chain transactions will increase as more people use LN because they have to open and close channels using on-chain transactions. Also, if fees for on-chain transactions don't increase, what is the incentive for using LN and locking your money?
2. This means that as a payment system, LN users will incur a cost of 2 transaction fees for each channel. If I open and close 12 channels a year worth say 0.1 BTC each, and then the transaction fee is 0.0005 x 2 = 0.001 BTC each, then I'll be paying 0.012 BTC in transaction fees per year. Even at today's prices, that's a lot. 12% of the size of the channel, in fact.

At any fee level that the users are willing to tolerate, an attack on a chain with a greater capacity is more expensive. In fact the price can grow superlinearly. If we assume "legitimate" demand to be say 900kB/block, then the attacker only has to pay for 100k transactions per block to create a backlog. With 2 MB blocks, that same attacker has to pay 1.1MB, which is 11 times higher. And at 8MB, the spam volume needs to be 71 times higher!!!

The danger of deflation is an economic myth that long predates bitcoin. People still buy computers and phones today even though a dollar will buy twice as much compute capacity in 18 months. Apple and Samsung's revenues have never been higher though they sell products most affected by deflation.
Especially with bitcoin, even as it appreciates, we can make it grow even faster (think $100k/coin) by actually spending coins and immediately buying them back. That way you increase the velocity of money as well as add to the network effect, without sacrificing your bitcoin holdings.
However, ultra-low transaction fees and high transaction capacity are absolutely critical to achieve this.

@_date: 2017-11-04 11:50:49
I updated the previous post just after. But in case it still doesn't answer your question, let's say there are limit orders on the book:
    Sell:
    2 
    1 
    Buy:
    2 
    1 
    2 
If you are selling 3 coins with a market sell order, then you will get 2\*7225 + 1\*7200 = $21650. If you are selling 5 (i.e. 2 more), then you will get 2*7150 more because you will now match all 3 limit buy orders.
If you are placing limit sell orders instead, then with a limit price of $7200, you will match the top 2 orders, so you can sell up to 3 coins for $7200 or better, but you can sell 5 coins for $7150 or better.
On the other hand, let's say a market sell order eats up the top bid (2*7225). So the latest market price was 7225. Then other traders enter bids for $7230 and $7240. Those are lower than the best limit sell order ($7250), so they don't execute. That's how you now have 2 buy orders that are higher than the last executed trade.

 Hence, spam_8MB/spam_1MB = (8MB - legit_volume)/(1MB - legit_volume)

A market sell order will match the best limit buy order and will be marked red (a "sell"). A market buy order will match the best limit sell order and will be marked green (a "buy").
A sell order has the effect of pushing the price lower because it takes out the highest buy order, and the next highest buy order is necessarily at a lower price.
Thus, when they say the price is falling because there are more sellers than buyers, what it is saying is there are more "market sell" orders than "market buy" orders.
The market depth is simply the total size of orders at a certain price or better. If the current price is $7300 but there are buy orders adding up to 42 coins that are at $7200 or better, then that is how many you would need to sell before the price drops below $7200. For each such order, you multiply the size by the price, that is how many $ it takes to eat that particular order. Add those up, and it tells you how many $ all the orders up to a certain depth are worth.
As for your other question, it is possible for current limit buy orders to be higher than the last executed trade. One way this happens is if after the trade is complete, new buy orders come in at higher prices but are not matched by existing sell orders which are at an even higher price.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:30:57
Put your cursor on the right edge of the chart to see how many transactions are at any given fee level. The safe assumption is that that level will stay constant over the next few days. Because of this, the safest tactic is to use the fee corresponding to the top 2500 txns in the mempool.

1. So there are some disagreements between core developers about whether and how to increase the bitcoin blocksize in order to support a higher transaction rate, due to projections that the actual transaction rate will hit the maximum possible rate in a few months time.
2. There is a concrete proposal (BIP 101), as well as an actual implementation of it, named Bitcoin XT, which will increase the block size to 8 MB if certain preconditions are met.
3. Blocks created under this updated spec will not be valid on existing bitcoin node software. This makes Bitcoin XT a *fork* because at some point it is possible for the part of the bitcoin network running with BIP 101 to recognize new blocks (and therefore transactions) that the other part does not recognize as valid.
4. To ensure consensus, the max blocksize increases only if 75% of the preceding blocks as of the target date identify themselves as BIP 101 compliant. These pre-fork blocks will be valid on both core and XT. The only difference at this stage is the *version number* in the block metadata.
5. This post points out that the first block was found by a miner using software that claims to include BIP 101. This is most likely Bitcoin XT, the only known public release with this feature.
6. As proof, the post links to a site which displays details of this (and every other) block.
7. It turns out that not only is there disagreement between the two camps, but one of the camps does not even recognize the proposed BIP 101 fork as true bitcoin. This camp also seems to be in control of both and the blockexplorer site to which this post points.
8. As a result of their conviction that bitcoin xt is not really bitcoin, and of their control over both and blockexplorer.org, these individuals feel justified in both censoring xt-related posts on and, in this case, refusing to serve the details of the specific block from blockexplorer.org that this post links to.
All in all, it's a strange situation that both camps are in, and it is causing some people to find alternative venues to discuss bitcoin without what is perceived as censorship.

It's a numerical value, it can be decimal (created with say a deck of cards without the face cards), or binary (coin toss) or hexadecimal (roll hex-dice).
To import it into a wallet, you would load up something like bitcoinpaperwallet.com into firefox, switch to offline mode, and then enter the manually created number to convert it into an importable private key, the corresponding bitcoin address etc.
EDIT: bitcoinpaperwallet.com does not support decimal values, but it does support hex, and it is relatively simple to convert binary to hex: e.g. 0001 is hex 1, 1001 is hex 9, 1010 is hex a etc.

You will need to go complain to Satoshi here. His insight was that a decentralized currency needs a proof-of-work to prevent double-spend attacks, and the proof-of-work needs an incentive in order to bother being computed. As well, the currency needs to get into the hands of people, and seigniorage is the way to do it.
If we are spreading costs of the block reward over the entire economy, it is only because if blocks stop or become insecure, that economy will vanish.
As far as low fees are concerned, a currency is only successful if you can transact with it at a very low cost (e.g. physical money), or by offering a compelling convenience and network effect (e.g. Visa). People would not mind paying visa-like fees if bitcoin were equally as prevalent and as fricionless as the payment card networks.

$8/transaction times ~250k trans/day is about $2M/day. They could shut down bitcoin to all users for an entire month for just $60M. And they could recoup most of that by shorting bitcoin beforehand and then watching the price crash.

Yes, the elliptical-curve cryptography parameters (ecdsa using the secp256k1 curve) remain unchanged across bitcoin and all chains branching off of it at different forks. These parameters are what make the private key work.
The whole point of a fork is to create a chain which changes the rules for valid blocks or transactions, but for a fork to be meaningful, every unspent output from before the fork has to be spendable after the fork, which means that the preexisting private key has to be able to sign transactions included in the post-fork chain.

3. Nothing. There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there, they all survive or thrive to different degrees, and they all compete and coexist with bitcoin.
4. As people understood the technology and the economics, they became prepared to assign a value to the utility that bitcoin provides.

Yes, almost any 256-bit number (see secp256k1 specs) is a valid private key, so you can definitely generate it without a computer.

For rights to be meaningful, they have to be consistent and universal. I cannot have right A, if asserting that right violates your right B (where B could be the same as A or a different right).
Thus, when an organization states that each individual has the right to do what they want without someone else telling them not to do it, that right naturally implies a prohibition on doing X, where X is telling someone not to do something. It is the only way for that right to be meaningful.
Of course it seems to be self-contradictory, because the right tells you not do X, and telling you not to do something is what the right itself says you cannot do (as you pointed out). But if you exempt this self-referential case, the right is otherwise self-consistent and meaningful.
Put another way, it's an organizational statement, not a suicide pact.

I think it is strongly likely to be. The private key is 256 bits, and so is the public key. The address is the 160-bit RIPEMD hash of the public key. This means that there could be up to 2^96 public keys that map to the same address. At least one of those 2^96 keys should have a corresponding private key. I don't know if ripemd160 itself is surjective (e.g. maybe the trivial 0 value might not be in the codomain as is common in cryptographic hash functions), but let's assume it is.
This is obviously not a rigorous proof, but given that RIPEMD essentially scrambles the public key and is not related to the secp256k1 curve that relates the private and public keys, it would have to be a really extraordinary coincidence to find a ripemd hash all of whose public keys belong to the set of keys without corresponding private keys. And this is *assuming* that that set is not provably empty. It very well might be.
@_date: 2015-07-20 10:02:55
log2(52!) is 225, so you already have 225 bits of entropy in a shuffled deck. So you have a 52-digit base52 number, which you can then represent as a 225-bit number, and then add 31 bits of padding (even 0 bits will do) to get a very secure private key.
Edit: I realized it's not that trivial to convert the 52-digit base52 number into a 225-bit number because there's a fair amount of redundancy, and you will actually get something like a 292-bit number instead. However, it is safe to drop the extra 36 bits because you really only need 160 bits of entropy for bitcoin because of the way private keys map to addresses.

Let's say you want to buy something online, from... say overstock.com or newegg.com. You would provide your credit card number, CVC etc., and they pull the money out.
If someone breaks into their database, they can steal your information, including your credit card number, and make unauthorized charges. Granted, your bank will protect you against them, but it would still be an inconvenience.
Bitcoin is a "push" mechanism as opposed to a "pull" mechanism, in that it's just like mailing a cashier's check (or better yet, making a wire transfer) to the recipient. It can only be cashed in the amount specified, and only by the recipient specified. No one can make unauthorized charges from your bank account by intercepting the payment.
If, on the other hand, you are selling something, and accept credit card or paypal payments. A malicious payer can receive the goods or services, and then dispute or reverse the charge. On top of that, you will pay anywhere from 3% to 22% in transaction fees to the bank depending on how risky your bank considers you to be.
With bitcoin, there are very little transaction fees (~3c, or even free in many cases), and no way to reverse transactions. This means a low-margin business can benefit greatly by replacing credit card payments with bitcoin.
If you wanted to send money to a person or an organization like wikileaks, but didn't want anyone (your bank, credit bureaus, or spouse etc.) to know, bitcoin provides a mechanism to conduct transactions privately. It's not completely anonymous, but with a bit of vigilance and wallet hygiene you can maintain your privacy to a much higher level than other forms of payments.
Finally, if you are concerned about getting stuck in a situation where your assets, bank accounts etc are frozen (eg civil forfeiture), and even your physical cash seized, then bitcoin provides an alternative means to store your emergency funds for lawyers, expenses etc until you resolve the situation.

  the cost of which is 1e17 cents, or USD 1e15.  
  Thus, the break-even price of bitcoin, assuming all other costs are zero, is USD 1e15 / 3.125 = USD 320 trillion.
You could just about retire on that.

Let's say you want to buy one bitcoin, and the latest price is $7200. However, the market is volatile, so there's no guarantee that you will get exactly 7200. If you put a market buy order and just before your order gets in someone else buys up all the coins offered at $7200, you might end up paying $7300 for that one coin.
SO assuming the current price is higher than $7200, and if the $7200 price is important to you, but you don't mind waiting for some time (or forever) until the market price falls to that level, you place a limit order. This tells the exchange to keep your buy order  on the book, until it is the best (i.e. highest) price, and someone then enters a market sell order.
A trader who enters a limit order is a maker (because she's adding to the order book), while a trader who enters a market order is a taker (because he's removing an order from the order book).
Here's an example order book:
    Asks:
    Price | Amount
    7300 | 2
    7250 | 1
    Bids:
    7225 | 2
    7200 | 1   &lt;-- your order
    7150 | 3
These are limit orders sitting on the book, i.e. not executed yet. When a market sell order is entered, it is matched against the best limit buy order first. If the market sell order size is less than the best limit buy order size, then the limit buy order is matched only partially. If it is greater, it will completely eat up the top limit buy order and then will be matched to the next highest bid and so on.
So, in the above example, for your order to be executed a sufficiently large market sell order needs to be placed, and one of these things needs to happen:
1. The sell order adds up to 3 BTC (2 BTC to take up the $7225 bid and one to take up your $7200 bid).
2. The $7225 bid is canceled.
3. No one else enters bids higher than yours before your order is executed.

If you use 32 cards (A-7, and say K representing 0), or better yet just 16 cards, then you can produce 5-bit numbers by randomly drawing a card, noting down its value, and then replacing it before the next random drawing. This relies on randomness of the draw instead of the ordering. It's also the simplest method because you get a stream of bits, or hex digits in case of 16 cards, and you only need to concatenate the values to get a usable private key value.

Look at the mempool stats at 
Put your cursor at the far right edge of the chart and read out the value corresponding to 2200 transactions. That's the fee (in sat/B) you need to get into the next block. Furthermore, if the chart had been stable or rising, that is the fee you need to get in within any reasonable time. Currently the cutoff is somewhere between 80-100, so we'll be conservative and use 100. A nominal transaction is ~250 bytes, so the fee should be 25k satoshi, or 0.25 millies, which is about US $1.80

Nothing is canceled unless you cancel it yourself.
If there is a matching sell order at 47.96 or lower, your limit buy order will match against it and execute partially or fully depending on the size.  Otherwise, your order will stay on the book until someone enters a market sell order (or a limit sell with price of at most 47.96).
You use the depth chart to figure out the size of an order that is likely to be executed completely at any price. However, in a fast moving market things change within the second, so it's only an estimate. If your limit order doesn't get executed fully, it remains on the book until it is matched later or until you cancel it.

Bitcoins are just numbers - they cannot indeed be lost. In case of Mt Gox, the actual number of bitcoins on their wallet was discovered to be different from what their accounting "system" thought it should be. Somewhere between 2011 and 2013, coins were transferred to wallets not in their control, without the corresponding adjustment being made to their accounting database.
Or maybe it was fiat that was fraudulently ascribed to certain accounts, which didn't match their actual bank balance. These accounts were then able to buy real bitcoins on the exchange and irreversibly withdraw them, leaving Mark Gox with an irreconcilable deficit.

This is the type of contradiction that you are bound to end up with if you start with an invalid or meaningless premise (similar to zero over zero or zero times infinity in math).
The very term "community consensus" is undefined, and indeed impossible to define in any meaningful way, especially when you consider adversarial actions. Is the community the current users? The holders? The spenders? The merchants? The exchanges? The regulators? The speculators who also trade other coins? The watchers who will jump in if the price is right? The developers who may or may not own coin? Anonymous subreddit members?
It is in fact not possible to identify a community, much less define what community consensus means. Moreover. under any definition, any adversary can present themselves as a community member and thwart any consensus whatsoever, which basically means community consensus is forever unattainable.
There is, therefore, absolutely no point in discussing community consensus as a criterion for any kind of progress, because it guarantees that that will never occur.

A lot of opposition to LN-but-no-blocksize-limit-raise (independently of LN's possible shortcomings) is from the fact that, as great as it may be for scaling, it won't be here for many months, won't see widespread adoption for years (bitcoin took 4-5 years to be well known), but blocks are already full and fee-paying transactions are already backing up.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:54:56

The biggest cost would still be capital. For example, an antminer s7 costs $1000, and provides ~5 TH/sec at 1300W, compared to the total current network capacity of say 2M TH/sec. So after the next halving, you're paying $1000 with the expectation of getting back (5/2M) * 144 * 12.5 * 365 = 1.7 BTC or about $700 in one year, with the following caveats:
1. Total hash rate doesn't increase (yeah, right).
2. We're ignoring electricity costs for power and cooling
3. We're assuming the price hovers near $400/BTC. It could go up, but then it could also go down.
So basically if you factor in electricity costs of (1.3 kW x 8800 hours/year x $0.06/kWh) =~ $700 (which cancels out the mining revenue), you are forfeiting the $1000 capital costs in the first year. And chances are you will be mining very very little in the second year anyway.
That's a lot of charity!

Needing to think about building a fire-resistant house doesn't justify limiting the water pressure to the fire hydrant.
People have been thinking about this for many years. The problem is now we have reached a point where fee-paying transactions are coming in faster than they can be confirmed. This will lead to a crisis of confidence unless we do something about it.
As for the blockchain being free of charge, and that being a tragedy of the commons, it sounds like a good analogy but it's not valid. Unlike overfishing, for example, where anyone is free to go out with a boat and a net, the blockchain is gated by miners. If miners think their resources are being abused by freeriders, which costs them real CPU cycles and real megawatt-hours, there's no doubt that they will throw such low-fee transactions on the floor.
What we don't need is an artificial external limit on the supply, because constraining supply (or demand for that matter, say be requiring a minimum transaction amount), is what makes the market less free, hence less efficient, and ultimately less useful.

In a free market, it doesn't really matter whether you think someone deserves something or not. All that matters is that all parties to the deal consent to it. If miners are willing to mine free transactions, that's between miners and transactors.
Oh and by the way, almost none of the transactions being sent right now are free. They are all including at least the minimum required network fee.


And here I was hoping to discuss facts, not rhetoric. But in any case, I'm hopeful that as demand pressure piles up and market confidence takes a hit, it will propel more and more players in the bitcoin ecosystem to support large blocks.

@_date: 2016-02-24 17:04:32
It's the pigeonhole principle: If there are more transactions than there is space for them in blocks, at least one transaction must be left out.
It's the flow rate principle: If there are more transactions coming in than there are going out (i.e. confirmed), the number of unconfirmed transactions will grow without limit.
It's the starvation principle: If the number of incoming transactions with fees larger than your transaction is consistently larger than the number of outgoing transactions, and miners always choose transactions ordered by fee, then your transaction will never be confirmed.
It's a race to death: If transactions are coming in faster then they are confirmed, and miners choose transactions by the highest fee, then every one will try to raise their fees enough to be included, which implies that some transactions will always be left out even if they increase the fee.
It's a suboptimal equilibrium: Fees cannot rise indefinitely. Instead, they will inhibit (ie price out) incoming transactions until the number matches outgoing transactions again. Since the latter isn't increasing, what we have is a suboptimal equilibrium: the bitcoin economy will stop growing before it has realized its full potential.

This might be at the heart of the differences between the two camps: I don't think anyone should have the right to define spam for the whole network, or make judgments as to which transactions are good and which ones are bad. We should leave that up to the miners. If miners don't like the fees a transaction is paying, they have always been free not to mine it.
Segwit provides a one-time increase in head-room of between 30-70%. If you don't already have a block-size increase code release when segwit rolls out, we will still hit the brick wall within a few months.
RBF in fact has anti-scaling effects. Transactions that don't use it can remain in limbo for-ever (as long as the incoming transaction rate is higher than network throughput). Transactions that do use it use 2x the bandwidth, because you have to retransmit the tx with the higher fee. If all transactions bump up fees and retransmit, their relative priority order remains unchanged and we're back to square one but with higher fees, until people start giving up on bitcoin.

The reason these things need to be handled by a monopoly is that they involve the use of force. When individuals deal with each other honestly, there is no use of force involved. However, whenever one person takes by force what is not legitimately theirs, a retaliatory force is needed to protect the rights of the victim.
Because this retaliatory force is also controlled by persons, not all of whom have the perfect judgment, it is necessary for it to be a monopoly constrained by the rule of law.
People often point to Somalia as a place with no government and no laws. That is exactly not true. The problem with Somalia is that there are many *competing* governments with the means to use force. And when they disagree, the predictable result is violence.

As long as not all blocks are full, and the rate of incoming transactions is smaller than available capacity, some (or even many) transactions will get through for very low fee, even if it takes a few blocks.
Once the rate approaches or passes the maximum possible TPS, this is no longer true, and both fees and confirmation times will start increasing, to the point where if the growth continues at the same rate, most transactions will never confirm, and the raw mempool size will increase without limit.
Growth will taper off and prices fall due to loss of confidence long before then, however.

What is the average size of Antpool blocks compared to the average size of all blocks? What happens to this stat when you exclude empty blocks that followed very shortly (i.e. less than a minute) after the precedeing block?
When an empty block is found only a few seconds after the preceding block, it does not negatively affect the transaction throughput, nor does it waste much work being done by other miners because they have only been at it for those few seconds.

Assuming that bitcoin classic proponents and supporters are good-faith, rational people like yourself, what would drive them to do something that to you seems impatient, immature and unconvincing? Either the assumption that pro-Classic people are smart, honest and well-meaning is false, or you are misreading the situation.
If it is the former, then you have already won the argument. But consider the possibility that you are mistaken. Give some thought to the arguments: bitcoin has done well so far, but its adoption is very very tiny - perhaps a mere million people own non-trivial amounts of bitcoin, and maybe 10M people are familiar with it. Historically the thing that has drawn new users to bitcoin is its low barrier to entry: any one can download a wallet to their phone, and transact in bitcoin instantly. What keeps those users coming back is the speed and reliability with which transactions are acknowledged, and the low low cost of sending money to any one, any where, at any time. This is what "peer-to-peer electronic cash" means.
Now that the exponentially growing adoption rate is nearing the network capacity limit imposed in early days out of concern for network performance in the face of sudden spam overload, it is worth asking whether that limit is still needed (if it ever really was). Not asking and not diligently answering that question risks cutting off the growth of the bitcoin ecosystem prematurely, giving it a bad reputation for being an unreliable, expensive, niche technology that is not worth bothering with in spite of its world-changing promises of freedom.
Classic supporters have asked themselves this question, and have concluded that it is safe to support higher network capacity through the simple mechanism of raising the spam limit. Instead of limiting the transaction rate through the protocol, forcing network nodes to drop or delay transactions, we should make it possible for miners to include more transactions and choose whether the transaction amounts and fees are sufficient for inclusion.
There are valid questions around decentralization and cost/incentive structure, and those have been extensively discussed over the last few years by people deeply involved in this topic. I for one am convinced that raising the block size is the safest, quickest and most effective way of avoiding the capacity wall, without ruling out other fascinating ways to scale bitcoin in the medium or long term.
I am also assured that there is no ill-will toward core proponents on the part of most Classic supporters. This isn't about personalities and spite. It is, instead, about the very nature of bitcoin as an open-source, permissionless system, where the competition is between ideas, and not guns or personalities. If forks can happen, they will happen. A fork will succeed or fail on its own merit, depending on whether it has the economic majority behind it. Tilting against this windmill is futile and counterproductive. We in the classic camp are risking our own valuable bitcoins, we would not do so lightly or out of mere anger or disdain.

Think of addition with carry as a mathematical algorithm. You have one bit from each of the 2 addends in each power-of-2 place plus a carry bit, and if the bits add up to 0 or 1, you get 0 or 1 as the result, but if they add up to 2 or 3, you again get 0 or 1 (resp) as the result, and you carry a 1 bit over to the next higher place.
You can implement this in hardware where an XOR gate implements the sum and something like (A AND B) OR (A AND C) OR (B AND C) implements the carry. The gates themselves are constructed out of transistors, like MOSFETs or bipolar junction transistors, or heck, even with relays or vacuum tubes.
You could patent the transistors, and (possibly) even the specific arrangement of gates to implement the add with carry. But not the add-with-carry algorithm itself. So if someone else builds it with a different hardware scheme, , which doesn't copy your scheme (say exclusively with NAND or NOR gates instead of AND and XOR), then there should be no infringement.
Note that I say "should" because that's how I think it ought to be. But the law many times works in its own weird way.

A delay in pushing a great solution is preferable to prematurely choking off the growth of the ecosystem before the solution is ready.
Node centralization is less critical than miner centralization, and mining is already heavily centralized. Again, if 2MB blocks somehow cause more centralization, that is still preferable to letting bitcoin wither on the vine. At least until the replacement solutions are ready for mass adoption.

Either way, you're relying on security from obscurity. As soon as your scheme is known, it is trivially vulnerable to attack, especially if you use a small dictionary.
Think of the private key as cash in your wallet. The only reason it is secure is because it's on your person, and because people have to have physical access to it. What you're looking for in a password is protection from arms-length hackers. Because of that, it is best to choose a key that is difficult for hackers to guess, but that you can protect physically as if it were a physical $100 bill *and* a secret known to you and trusted people around you.
So go ahead and write down that password and stick it in your wallet or in your passport. Also back it up in another couple of locations. If you use your email address as the salt, a random stranger who finds it will not be able to steal your bitcoin with it.

You might be right about deposits. I looked up the [2014 annual report]( for Wells Fargo bank, and while they have $1T in core deposits, their interest income is $43B, which is 4%. They also have non-interest income of another $40B or so, and their total net income is $23B.
If we naively attribute about $12B of that net income to interest income, they are netting that much on $1T of deposits.
EDIT: All that said, coinbase charges 1% on transactions, not deposits, and doesn't have to worry about investment risk, so I still think their business model is much more profitable than deposit-taking banks.

If there are no sellers at $7900 (they'd rather hodl), then the spot price will struggle to reach that level. People will still pay a premium if they want bitcoin now (for example to actually use it to transfer funds). Also, at some point, observing the lack of sellers, futures contract writers will want to stock up on bitcoins that contract buyers will ask for. This will put further upwards pressure on the spot price, as well as on any new contracts you are willing to write.

My apologies for the security verbiage you clearly don't need :-) I do hope other readers might find some of this useful though.
While I'm no specialist in the field of security, it does interest me greatly. I still think that your scheme may be overly burdensome, but we haven't discussed your threat model so I can't be sure.
For the case of the general bitcoin user with less than say 1000 BTC, I don't think they need to worry about an adversary with 100 cpu-years worth of resources. I might add that such an adversary would probably get better results with rubber-hose cryptanalysis ([relevant xkcd](
I consider myself a typical bitcoin user (with bitcoin a representing single-digit percentage of my net worth), and my main concerns are:
1. Phishing/malware/keyloggers stealing my wallet passwords as I type it - mitigated by using a cheap dedicated bitcoin-only off-line PC, and e.g. smartphone security hygiene.
2. A somewhat motivated, knowledgeable adversary, e.g. a work colleage or an acquaintance who might know about my interest in bitcoin, where I live etc. This can be countered by not leaving passwords in obvious places, not using trivial passwords, using strong 2FA on any online exchange/wallet accounts etc.
3. State actors, law-enforcement, etc. This is unlikely but can happen, e.g. if you are sued for damages etc. One defence against that is to use multisig, with keys in different jurisdictions. Even different countries if possible, or with your lawyer etc.
4. Incapacitation. If I'm not around (for the moment or more permanently), I would still want my next of kin to have access to my bitcoins. This can be handled again with multisig, services like google inactive account manager (but with 2FA!) etc.

I agree. Hash rate does not determine what is bitcoin. In fact, it is a permissionless network open to all participants, public and anonymous, sympathetic and hostile. Each participant determines for themselves what bitcoin is. If a large portion of the network agrees on that determination, and it has sufficient hash rate to ward off hostile attacks, then that constitutes what is widely accepted as bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:10:50
So that's the distinction, isn't it: the validity is determined by a validating node. There is nothing that makes all validating nodes apply the same rules after the fork, except for economic interest that may take some time to converge. So u/ddbbccoopper was right to say that all it takes is a one miner to cause a fork. Whether that fork survives in the long term is a different story.
@_date: 2015-04-28 05:47:26
Not necessarily. A higher electricity price will globally make mining less profitable. Some miners will stop being profitable, and will shut down. This will lead to the difficulty adjusting downwards to keep the block discovery rate constant. All of this, independent of the price of bitcoin.
Edit: to elaborate, just because the cost of mining increases, doesn't mean that miners will sell fewer bitcoins (in fact they will likely sell more of the bitcoins they mine), and it doesn't mean that the economy will absorb more bitcoins that are mined.

It depends on the wallet, and your level of paranoia. Some wallets like electrum have some degree of coin control, i.e. choice of which private key(s) to use for the next transaction. Mycelium, on the other hand, does not have this.

If you have a trusted intermediary, you only need their word that the transfer is good. They assume the liability for double spends (although they might mitigate the risks by locking the new funds for a while).
If you don't have a trusted intermediary, as in a permissionless decentralized payment network, you have to verify that funds that are sent to you actually are good. Double spend is one form of a bad payment, and sending a transaction from an address without sufficient funds is another. For both those cases, you need to have a history as well as a confirmation mechanism. You could certainly do a hash table or db instead of a block chain, though making it work might be technologically challenging.

Let's quantify it then.
A contemporary (2015) high-end PC, which is what a node needs to be, typically has 16GB RAM, 2 TB HD, and 2-4 cores that can perform ~1 billion integer ops each per second, for typical workloads with good cache locality.
A modern broadband connection in US/Europe/Japan/Korea is at least 10 Mbps and up to 1 Gbps.
All of these numbers have been keeping up remarkably well with Moore's law for several years now, and are quite likely to keep doing so for the foreseeable future.
Is that not, in your opinion, enough to run a full node at today's specs, and to continue scaling it at the rate proposed by BIP 101?
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:56:07
No, if you send them to 2 different addresses, the block chain shows:
SRC1 -&gt; DEST1
SRC2 -&gt; DEST2
There is nothing which suggests a relationship between SRC1 and SRC2.
In OP's case, we have:
SRC1 -&gt; DEST
SRC2 -&gt; DEST
Now a casual observer would notice that both SRC1 and SRC2 can be associated through DEST in some way.
Another instance of loss of privacy is if SRC1 is OP's boss, she can now see what other amounts are being sent to OP's account besides salary payments she made herself. This is not what most people would want to happen with their regular paycheck and bank account.

The economic self-interests of all sincere parties are aligned in Bitcoin, and as long as those parties constitute the economic and hash-rate majority, bitcoin is resilient to attacks by insincere parties.
If it turns out that raising the block size limit causes problems like mining centralization (remember ghash.io?), then the market will either voluntarily limit blocks to a technologically appropriate size, or a soft fork can bring the size down.
If you do not think that bitcoin can work as a permissionless system with emergent consensus of economically self-interested parties, and that it needs leadership of some sort from developers, miners or whatever, I think you might be better off under a different regime.

Depends on which "people" you worry about. If it is private individuals or even private businesses, financial institutions etc., this is easy to do: send your coins to an exchange, then withdraw them to a new address. In this case only the exchange you use will be able to deanonymize your coinflow.
If you want to hide your coins from a government with subpoena powers, you can take your chances with an exchange in a different country, private cash sale/repurchase, tumblers etc.
You could also generate a bunch of addresses, and run a script to update your website a new address as soon as a transaction to an existing address is detected. However, this will not prevent a diligent stalker from keeping track of all such addresses. it may be possible to write a server-side script that takes the hash of the incoming request (ip address, user agent, time) to compute an index into a large table of precomputed addresses, and serves the corresponding address dynamically upon load.

OK, so which one is it Greg - either we can scale to 100 MB on-chain, or we cannot scale LN beyond 1.5 channels (open+close) per second at the current blocksize? Are you willing to concede that with 1 MB / block, that LN is limited to about 4M max users opening/closing one channel per month?

7 billion transactions (1 per human) per day, at say 288 bytes/transaction, and approx 144 blocks per day, requires a block size of 14 GB. That's big, but not unreasonable, a few decades down the road.
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:09:02


1.5 open + 1.5 close = 3 transactions per second.
Where does the number 3 (instead of 7) come from? From the data. Look at the last dozens or hundreds of blocks, e.g. on blockr.io. Filter out all incomplete blocks (say below 950 kb). You still get ~2000 transactions per block (i.e. per 10 minutes). That's about 3.3 tps.
Yes, segwit, if activated and widely used, could bump this up by 1.5-2x, but in order to get even 1% of visa's user base (just to open and close one LN channel per month) you will still need to increase the blocksize by many many times that.
Seriously, this is not just a matter of abstract opinion. We should all be looking at data and at the very least acknowledge the limitations of our proposed course of action.

Replace by fee is not the same as double spend right? The destination addresses and amounts remain the same, just the fee changes.

As long as miners require fees (and why shouldn't they?) the cost to the attacker increases by several times when you go from 1 MB to 2 MB block size. For example, with 900 kb/block of organic utilization, the attacker needs to pay for 100kb/block to cause run-away fee increases. When you increase the block size to 2 MB, now the attacker has to pay for 1100 kb/block, or 11 times as much!

Yes the public key, and only the public key, can decrypt [resp. encrypt] messages encrypted [decrypted] using the private key. This is the basis for public key infrastructure.
If Alice knows Bob's public key, Bob can sign a message by encrypting plaintext with his private key, and send the ciphertext, along with the hash of the plaintext, to Alice. She can verify that it came from Bob because she is able to decrypt it using his public key, and also verify the hash.
For privacy, Bob can first encrypt with his private key, then with Alice's public key. This ensures that only Alice can read the message.
Edit: note that bitcoin is pseudonymous, so there is no need to associate a sender's identity with their public key. If the public key attached to the transaction hashes to the sending address, and if it can decrypt the text encrypted (signed) using the private key, then the transaction is valid.

Public key cryptography relies on asymmetric encryption: One key can encrypt the plaintext that only the other key can decrypt (and vice versa). In other words, the private key can encrypt the transaction to generate cyphertext, which ONLY the public key can decrypt.
When you generate a transaction, the wallet software generates a "script" which specifies the destination addresses to which the unspent balances on your address will be sent. You then encrypt this using your private key, then append your public key to it.
Anyone who wishes to verify that the message was correctly signed (in particular nodes, miners and the recipient) needs to use the public key you provided to successfully decrypt the cyphertext.

You can find previous releases of electrum at  Once you reinstall the older version, you can then restore your wallet and then try updating to 2.0 again as mentioned by [above](
If the wallet fails to work after update (this should not happen), the workaround is to transfer coins from the old wallet to the new one.
Do you have a second secure computer on which to install a different version of electrum? If so, you can just send your coins from the old wallet to the newly installed one. 
If not, you might need to first transfer your coins to one or more temporary paper wallets generated using, say, bitaddress.org or  then update electrum and transfer the coins into the newly created wallet.

The blockchain, and its mining mechanism, provide all of these features (provable, irreversible, non-counterfeitable, reliable, trustless, decentralized, peer-to-peer).
Happy to write a follow-up if you are interested in why exactly this requires mining in the form that bitcoin has.

We'll see, it's definitely exciting.
I think the big difference from HK/XT/Classic/BU is that this time 85% miners have signed the agreement with segwit2x devs and both sides are actually following through. Also, major businesses like coinbase and bitpay are on board. Non-mining nodes are followers, not leaders, so worst case they will fork themselves off onto a ghost chain with no blocks, but they won't influence mining nodes.

You might be able to have a physical token that uses some copy-proof natural process to encode a very large amount of unique data. Then combine this with smart contracts and zero knowledge proofs such that it is trivial to extract the public key for verifying unspent outputs, but impossible to extract the private key without destroying the physical token.

90% of the users are on platforms like blockchain.info (on board), coinbase (on board), bitpay (on board), or on light clients like electrum, which will have at least some servers running segwit2x.

The 8x increase is not in actual utilization. It's an increase in maximum network capacity. It will be many months before it gets used up on a regular basis. Until then, it will make the network more tolerant of sudden load spikes (organic as well as malicious).

Not all soft forks that "fool nodes" have the same consequences. Segwit fools nodes into validating something different from the actual transactions being conducted. A block size change without a header update merely fools lite clients into accepting a post-fork block, but does not feed them bogus transactions that look real.
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:15:56
The 1 MB / 2 MB is implied by the 4 MB / 8 MB block weight and the fact that non-segwit transactions do not get any discount off of the 4x weighting for a non-segwit payload.

Imagine that you invest $1000/month over a year, and now you have about $12000 worth of bitcoins that you have dollar-cost-averaged into. This is your position and you're happy with it.
Now, you wake up one morning and get an email from your exchange saying they have accidentally converted your bitcoins to fiat, but they're willing to let you buy back at the same price if you choose.
So here's the question. Do you choose to buy back all $12k at the current price, or do you dollar-cost average back over the following 12 months?

To an extent, the circularity is inevitable in any network. Why does everybody use facebook? Because everybody else uses facebook. The presence of other users gives the network value, but only as long as the network can provide useful features beyond just the numbers.
This is why bitcoin has the value it does, whereas altcoins, some with arguably better technology, don't even come close.

The refund can be done with a special coinbase transaction, but if we cannot do it in face of every government confiscation, we shouldn't do it for any.
Invalidating the UTXO subset that received the confiscated coins would be severely problematic, especially since they have been auctioned off and fungibility is of critical importance to bitcoin.

3 days before the halving, and the most recent adjustment to difficulty is upwards, so the hashrate is actually still going up. It has also gone up faster than the price rise, so clearly there is enough slack for miners to still make profits.

Here's a simple thought experiment: let's say there are 10 mining nodes, 100 non-mining nodes, and 10000 users including those 100 running non-mining nodes.
The mining nodes hard fork to 2 MB blocks, and the non-mining nodes promptly start ignoring them, and then wait forever for the next block to materialize.
9,900 of the users are able to continue transacting on the 2 MB chain because they don't run their own nodes. Bitcoin continues to provide utility for them and so they buy coins that miners have minted and things go on swimmingly.
How would these 100 non-mining nodes affect the outcome in your universe?

You can prove this by putting the "coin" in a reader that challenges it to decrypt text encrypted using the public key. The tricky parts are how to do this without revealing the private key, and how to guarantee that the private key isn't already known to the untrusted issuer.

With ultra cheap botnets, consumer nodes are *already* vulnerable to death by DDoS. This was illustrated repeatedly just a few months ago when XT and classic nodes were attacked.
The way to kill small-time nodes will not be through large blocks. It will be through cheap DDoS attacks. And keeping blocks small does nothing to prevent those.

Thanks. So the court says bitcoin is not money at this time nor tangible wealth like cash or gold bars. Defendant should not be punished for merely "selling his property."

Several people express the concern that larger blocks will make it impractical to run a node on your home PC. The point is that it's already impractical to run such a node because it has been proven vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks by malicious entities.

I don't know if there's any known information about IRS audits (or likelihood of triggering an audit) involving the provenance of bitcoins. (Oops, I didn't see you were in Australia. But the point still applies).
I'm still not sure why you wish to tumble your 50 BTC, since you are buying it in your own name from an exchange, and are going to declare the sale down the road.
I would say though, that if you do go through a tumbler and then claim a lower capital gains, then you would have to justify it (by clarifying the acquisition price/date and the sale price/date), which could be complicated.
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:08:15
Depends on your definition of issue. For me, if a network is over capacity and doesn't actually do what it is designed to do, that is an issue. Anyway the nice thing about a permissionless network is that you can keep running with the old parameters if you don't think there is an issue, and the rest of us can run with more capacity and we can all be happy.

That doesn't solve the counterfeit coin problem because you have to prove that the coin contains the private key without revealing the key. That's where the zero-knowledege proof can help.

How predictable of a big-blocker to use a little unsolved problem in LN to push their big blocks agenda! I mean, the risk of loss of funds is very small, and the funds themselves are small, so why freak out? Besides, with small blocks you will automatically limit the amount of LN channels that get opened and closed, which further limits the scope of the problem...

The big blocks might be marked invalid by individual full nodes, but they won't be orphaned by them. Orphaning a block refers to when a longer chain is built on top of the predecessor of that block; that won't happen if the hard fork has a supermajority.

Also, ideally, you should only run your "hot" wallet with a very small amount of spending money. The rest should be in cold storage: on paper, in an encrypted external usb drive, or on a computer that is always offline.

There's an"exit tax" that kicks in at a certain limit. So if you have a lot of money in tax-deferred retirement accounts (401k, IRA etc), all that tax becomes due right away instead of at retirement. I dont know if you can avoid it by leaving your money where it is but obviously that is also risky.

Go through the recovery flow at least once - make sure you know how to sweep the balance from the encrypted paper wallet into say your multibit wallet.
Also, is this your own "dumb" printer? Office printers frequently store files they print, so it could get into the wrong hands. Even though the private key is encrypted, you might lose some privacy by revealing how much money is in your wallet.
And finally, think about what happens to your money if something happens to you. Leave clear instructions for whoever will inherit your wallet. Maybe an M-out-of-N partitioning of the password so that no single family member has full access to it.
Forgot to add: keep a remote backup (soft copy in the cloud or a second paper wallet) at a separate location.
