Why do people hold?
If price goes from $100 to $10 you lost 90% of your investment and are unable to buy back lower. 
If you stop out at $80, you save yourself a lot of money/time. Also you can buy back in for a lot less and have more purchasing power. This mentality is bad
@_date: 2018-09-15 09:30:34
Just wait for the impending lower low for the year. That’s when capitulation starts to set in
@_date: 2018-09-25 14:15:42
Because nobody cares. They will all get turned down into the foreseeable future and rightly so. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 21:38:15
When you’re down 70% my strategy works great! Profit sooner rather than later 
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:10:04
Teahtherd at $7100 because it’s better to take profit while you can. The run lacked any conviction and was running on fumes once it hit $7000. 
Slowly waiting on my next entry, could be sub $6000. Anyways, I am only buying into support 
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:10:59
Dump it 
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:38:15
Shhhh you can’t include data that doesn’t support the trend 
@_date: 2018-09-17 19:37:02
Most likely we are gonna have a 2014 year. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 22:20:36
Personally I do not want government touching crypto. Government can only build roads and bridges right, that’s about it
@_date: 2018-09-12 21:37:45
When you’re down 50% my strategy makes great sense. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 15:45:20
Is it just me or have people not truly been capitulated yet? I feel like $6k has to give for people to actually start losing faith
@_date: 2018-09-21 16:04:38
$6.2 inbound. Hold that support boys 
@_date: 2018-09-08 16:46:03
Right? Next Bull Run I can make more buying fake twitter scam accounts then actually buying crypto haha
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:49:13
Between $5500 and $7000 if ETF is delayed 
@_date: 2018-08-02 00:05:17
Not another shit post :(
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:16:18
He’s invested in Blockchain cryptos. Sort of a set jerkoff thing for exposure 
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:05:04
I work for the corporate company that makes that brand (Modern Tool and Die). Thanks for your business and glad that we have a fellow BTC supporter as our customer. 
Happy Hodling
@_date: 2018-08-05 21:24:32
Should have sold at $8300 because I knew it was to good to be true. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 02:30:32
You give me 5 reasons why it will start, I’ll give you 5 reasons it won’t. 
1. Chinese New Years
2. Wall St, Bonuses 
3. Tax Day 
4. We haven’t dipped enough to bounce back to ATH
5. These posts 
Lol hope you enjoyed this 
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:09:32
So what’s the market cap gonna look like?
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:45:07
The fillers are a solid product category, some other brands we own are Cub Cadet and Troy Bilt. Those are our flagship brands 
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:15:28
Look at the sell orders 
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:50:27
You’re not very imaginative from an entrepreneur standpoint are you? There’s endless possibilities you could make for this device holder 
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:16:39
Not to rain on everyones parade but the author of this tweet chose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. B. 
If you compare Berkshire Hathaway Inc. A there is no comparison. Just some perspective 
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:09:19
Wow just like, Christmas, Chinese New Year, Tax Season, etc you get the point 
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:50:16
2013 bought in 2017
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:27:30
This made me laugh out loud, thank you
@_date: 2018-05-26 02:20:20
Early adopter written all over it 
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:18:10
You get 2  attempts 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:33:09
Set price alerts and when your coin hits your mark, check in on development/news. 
There’s no reason to let crypto consume your life.

Most creative meme I’ve seen in awhile tbh,
Here’s an upvote 
@_date: 2018-08-05 15:22:46
Products are quality and the company is great

Read the white paper 
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:28:40
Lol right....
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:00:26
Best way to reduce supply. People don’t care about bitcoin until they have to. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:59:16
I bet they didn’t say “worth it” 
@_date: 2018-10-30 22:56:06
Lmao my brother and I played that mission the other day, figured it was BTC too lol
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:34:02
This times 1000x. Tim Draper is not a reputable VC name. He ruined his name after this yet people still see him as “smart”
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:29:18
This doesn’t include installation costs though 
@_date: 2019-03-09 19:33:39
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:21:55
Agreed, fake feather FUD to farm whales cash. Now we drop a lot more and ruin people’s hope.
@_date: 2018-10-02 01:28:55
 I really like Peter Schiff. He’s anti fiat and bullish on gold. He doesn’t like Bitcoin but he’s also not into technology so I see why he does not like BTC. Everyone must admit here that if you were going to time travel with money in any direction, your best bet would be gold
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:46:28
Sell the bitcoin and buy new ones. They are compromised 
@_date: 2018-10-21 14:06:51
You want bullets not bitcoin at that point 
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:27:13
In terms of years, the bear markets are getting longer, that’s something nobody says because of selective data. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:12:33
How about that 3 year gap? Obviously MT. Gox/ China FUD 
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:43:47
It’s been doing something. Going down then up, then up then up, then down lol
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:10:48
Oh we are going lower. Just look at the current downtrend? Unless we get more SEC type news, nothing will change. Today was merely a pump and probably gonna dump again. Remember when markets crash there are winners, not just losers. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:48:35
You picked a good and bad time to join haha. Good because we are on an upswing. Bad because it’s not usually like this. Just look at the last 4 months haha 
@_date: 2018-06-12 10:24:29
Debit cards allow you to use your own money. If you’re taking a loan for crypto, you probably shouldn’t be investing that much.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:32:59
What am I looking at? A bit confused 
@_date: 2018-06-05 10:47:24
Temporary bottom right now? 
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:10:04
Love the atmosphere of this image 
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:49:23
You’re not serious are you?
@_date: 2019-02-27 05:04:19
That headline is trash, do better 
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:01:51
You gotta be shitting me lol I’m just gonna start trolling with transactions and name them, drugs, money laundering, prostitution etc
@_date: 2019-02-04 00:48:49
This is why i don’t think BTC has a future in the financial realm. This argument made in the tweet means nothing without adoption. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:03:07
You’re investing in the wrong assets if you believe governments will fail. Try brass and bullets
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:58:33
Cue the 300 Spartan Bitcoin video
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:15:22
Can we ban all the complaining about price too? People complaining about inter-day prices are not cut out for investing. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:35:23
It’s a sign of weakness, that’s for sure. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:07:19
This bear market will be longer then a year. Just a heads up 
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:40:28
Yeah should see a bit of a rise if not sideways action before another decline. You might be close to the overall bottom 
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:38:48
Can anyone show me proof that central banks are “manipulating” the bitcoin price? I see this thrown around all the time and I don’t believe it. Any discussion is welcome! 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:14:23
You missed the part where you buy at $6k 3-4 times and sell into the trend. Easy money made there
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:32:59
My short is still open since $19k
@_date: 2018-11-24 05:47:10
Sell and buy back then lol
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:32:36
Oh this makes so much sense. So we have to drop down in the hundreds of dollars now. /s
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:58:15
Lol it doesn’t not. This is a fraudulent statistic 
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:20:45
It’s going lower, this had little volume for a true reversal. We didn’t even retest any meaningful resistance either. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:10:44
The bear market continues 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:31:51
Well if you’re over exposed, take what capital you feel is necessary out at a loss. If not stay in this for the next few years because that’s when you will cash out at 1-1.  
The most important lesson you have now learned is never invest more than you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:08:32
Destroy it, I’m being serious. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:49:52
Wow you really sold everything??
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:19:56
I’m fucking dead lol
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:29:34
The bull run better be all year
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:36:05
What kind of stupid theory is this? Usually I’m pretty nice when commenting on Reddit but man, this is by far the dumbest ideas for the price crash to date. Christ lol let the bear market continue 
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:25:51
My imagination said zero, did I do it right? But it hit $100k first
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:41:01
Fake photo
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:56:25
I’m fucking dead lol
@_date: 2018-11-13 03:25:31
Lol @ anyone who buys this for $25k.. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:25:55
Hodl should be more of a U shaped and not a straight line lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:17:33
What a great family! Happy Birthday!
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:04:04
Did it years ago
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:10:57
Sad story tbh
@_date: 2018-11-18 06:37:46
Ultimate dip buy lol
@_date: 2019-01-31 17:36:00
That’s not true, while you may not sell the exact top, selling Btc at $16k would be selling the top relatively speaking. When a market has an exponential advance, it’s easy to see an inevitable fall
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:58:28
I’m fucking dead lol
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:21:04
Fair enough haha, stock are looking like crypto lately though
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:30:57
Time to sell?
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:19:59
Hasn’t everyone already removed their coins?
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:31:04
Buy and hold stocks was a thing before crypto though, so nothing new here 
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:28:06
Cash da fook out
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:49:48
Lol great post OP! Hopefully this shuts up the people that post this garbage 
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:56:29
So when all BTC is brought up and nobody is selling it what happens to the price?
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:16:38
The irony is that you probably use a majority of these platforms 
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:31:27
Tell me you sold in 15-16k digits and did not hold 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:30:42
Almost caught the bottom. Now you can be with us on our journey to the bottom! Welcome!
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:08:06
Anger/panic phase 
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:52:50
People said the same thing about going under $6k lol. Who knows you might have won, time will tell 
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:59:43
Bull market confirmed. Sold the house for this 
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:06:03
Capitulation hasn’t started yet, fuck 
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:47:21
Okay this time I’m selling an ATH lol.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:13:39
This is more like BTC bull Vs $7k resistance. 
It’s always a trap :( 
@_date: 2018-07-19 02:51:45
When has a casino ever done something nice for you?
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:39:46
I remember those days, everything was a bull 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:06:31
Too soon :( hopefully we stay afloat above $7k
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:53:23
Love it lol 
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:42:13
“Something that retains its value” BTC does not come to mind lol
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:57:48
If we ever fell back on gold, I think you would be better off melting the bars down for bullets ;)
@_date: 2018-04-30 20:35:55
Convinced by the title, say no more 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:42:02
I would like to sink this ship lower honestly, then start the water pumps.
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:03:20
This is a class bitcoin buy wall vs sell wall at $6.5k
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:21:02
Try again, check CZ’s twitter 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:36:34
It’s a long shot haha, maybe one day it can be. This market is too emotional for a store of value
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:02:28
We still need to break $8,500 to consider this a reversal. I am very pleased rn though 
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:47:39
Bitcoin isn’t exactly a safe asset 
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:35:10
I’d rather fly SpaceX
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:40:53
Let us have this moment 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:17:19
Nobody here has sold. If you’re still here, chances are you’re here until zero or $20,000
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:13:38
Best of luck, it will take another collapse to unhinge people from the teet of the gov and banks 
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:34:49
, in a year 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:27:20
lol nah
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:31:22
You shouldn’t have bought if you are nervous over this price. You might not see a rise in this investment for years to come. If you’re looking for quick gains, you already lost. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:36:08
Great now we know the amount of 2017 buyers! 
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:32:49
No 
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:13:05
He was the VC behind Elizabeth Holmes, you should do some do diligence before trusting someone like this. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:43:41
Lay real close attention to 2014 to 2017 everyone 
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:53:50
Wow a bitcoin investor saying that bitcoin will pump so you should buy? How could this not be a conflict of interest? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:50:56
Literally nothing will happen because we are not market movers
Also not everyone is on the same time, so it would be no different than a regular trading day 
@_date: 2018-12-01 05:43:36
 Hahaha That last line though
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:37:43
How’s that investment in Elizabeth Holmes Tim? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:02:48
Interesting, I guess if you can afford to lose it all! Have a good ride!
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:42:35
There will be plenty of time to buy lower 
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:25:38
Lol right? People better hope fiat never collapses because it will not end well on a global scale. If anything people should hope for an acceptance of BTC as a speculative asset 
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:46:45
BTC is not where you liquidate your equity positions to. This would be the most catastrophic financial decision you could make. 1-2% of your net worth max is my rule. Everything else would be in stable markets. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:13:03
Thus is why I don’t enjoy this sub as much anymore
