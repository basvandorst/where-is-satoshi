Because that worked so well for Slashdot?

Have you guys learned nothing from Mt. Gox? If the only thing you have going for you is that you can *trust* the other guy not to defraud you, then you won't have your Bitcoins for very long.
This applies to merchants accepting Bitcoin as well, and it always has. If a merchant has been exchanging their goods or services for zero-conf'd Bitcoins, without some form of insurance coverage to handle the risk of rejected transactions, then they are either incompetent or negligent.

All of business falls into either being an expert at a task on your own, or being able to trust an expert that you contract to do it for you.
When you accept payment by credit card you don't necessarily need to be an expert at how magnetic stripe technology works (though it might help if you wanted to provide extra anti-fraud protections for your customers). But the reason you don't need to be an expert is that you can trust Visa, MasterCard, etc. to assume the risk on your behalf (in exchange for a nominal fee, of course).
But even the choice of choosing Visa or MasterCard requires you to have the skill necessary to competently choose a payment contractor. In existing business sectors you can fake it by choosing the guy everyone else chooses, but you can't do that for Bitcoin yet! After all, the  market in the whole business went bust just this year.
So now you're in the dilemma that you need to know enough about Bitcoin and its theory of operation just to competently choose a subcontractor to help with payment processing on Bitcoin, even if you don't intend to handle payment processing yourself.

Yes, I put that one into "incompetent". :)
If you buy tulips just because everyone is saying how everyone is buying tulips then you deserve what eventually happens to you.

But wait, you're from how did you figure out how an ASIC works? Everyone who understands how technology works knows that Bitcoin is the future of money.

Sounds like a useful feature for "*the currency of the Internet*".
