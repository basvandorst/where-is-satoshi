That's the cost of a trust-less system. The fees banks "steal" from their users cover loss in a situation like this. The onus is completely on the users, and as we've seen today even the smallest mistakes have absolutely disastrous consequences.

Fairly pointless, as the iPads are wiped and restored very frequently. Daily or hourly in some cases.

Surprisingly? What information did I give that made me sound untrustworthy.

No, providing your 2FA key just authorises the server to send back your encrypted wallet to be stored in localstorage. After you put in your 2FA token the only protection is your password. Judging by that address having more funds stolen from another blockchain.info wallet a few horus earlier, it didn't take them long to break it. 
12 character strings are probably too weak to stand up to a significant attack, otherwise I'm not sure how they would have been able to send funds out of your account. 
Do you have any of the backups in your email? That's a more credible place than the 2FA token being broken. **It's very likely that your backup was sent to your email and it was taken from there.** If you use gmail, check the bottom of the page for recent logins that aren't yours. Look under account activity. The backups in your email completely bypass the 2FA.
If you are not using the password anywhere else, would you be able to reveal it or the format? There's no real harm in you doing so as this point, the damage has been done. It might help educate us on how this happened. 
I'm sorry for your loss, and sorry that people here don't want to believe what is a fairly credible story. At no point did you ask for donations.

No, nodes can't present a false blockchain. They would have to forge blocks, and forgo the 25BTC block reward. It's not economical or sensible for anybody to use petahashes of power just to fool some lite clients. No money could be stolen, just balances forged, and only if they controlled every peer your wallet connects to. Nobody would be so stupid as to try.

They have to prove an unspent input is in a block though, at least in the Multibit system.

They only had one 12 character password. You can do millions of attempts a second on a GPU. This is a community with farms of them mining Litecoin, a little downtime would be no issue.

Better protection, but still incredibly weak against attacks. Both passwords are able to be brute forced extremely fast.

Most 12 character passwords are easy. 
Password1234! 
There, fits the bill and is easy to crack. It took 7 hours between successful attacks, so they either had a lot of processing power or the OP used a weak password.

Things have changed a bit since then. They use servers but in a SPV model.

Nothing, it's not abnormal.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:31:27
I'm buying this. It looks like a blockchain.info transaction based on the send IP and the change address. It's either from their wallet or the pushtx service they offer. 
Was your password a phrase or sentence that might be found on the internet?
Be aware that the 2FA only allows access to your wallet file, if you've ever accessed it on a compromised machine then it could be stolen and attacked offline.

Running a transmitter without an antenna will likely destroy the amplifier. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:46:14
FUD. The backdoor only works from the internal network.
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:08:56
Yep. That would be enough. Time to change your gmail password and anything that shares it. Change any passwords that also have the gmail set as the recovery, as they could have been changed to different email addresses as well. This is just disaster recovery unfortunately, there's not much else you can do at this point. 
Blame blockchain.info for that stupid emailing backups practise. Try to work out how your email got compromised in the first place. Set 2FA on it as well.

You honestly believe that in the period while you are flashing your router someone will be in the near vicinity and infect you with malware?


Sounds perfectly sane to me. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:47:36
!!! would probably be a common prepend, making it just 9 chars lowercase and numbers.. not impossible I suppose. It's definitely my best guess for how you were compromised though. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:51:30
I've never been disingenuous. Unplugging the antenna from a transmitter is stupid, and calling a vendor backdoor THE NSA IS HACKING US is stupid as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:03:34
It depends on the password. 
20 truly random characters is impossible. 
20 human chosen characters is weak.
