@_date: 2019-07-20 17:16:24
This leads me to a cool idea, I don't know if its possible, but we should make an Eye Spy childrens book and have hidden bitcoins in them, each page is redeemable for a small amount of bitcoin once the coin is found.

lmao did he screw up? Anyone have video of that moment?
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:38:03
I don't think this is a very good example but I understand the point you are trying to make. A better example would be: I take my money build a house. I pay the merchants for the materials and the laborers for building the house. The merchants and the laborers all have my money as payment, but isn't my house worth its weight in gold? And isn't the value of the land worth more now that the house is built?  - This is a win - win scenario.

@_date: 2019-07-15 19:49:26
Yeah, they say it is based on thin air, blah blah illicit activity blah blah, but simultaneously say it is a risk to the USD.  - Why is this 'based on thin air' asset a risk to the integrity of the USD?  
Why is the illicit activity of the USD never taken into question?

Haha yeah I guess. I was picturing the rewards being very small though.
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:28:18
Its not easy enough to use or fast enough yet.  It probably needs custodial solutions before older people who don't trust technology use it. Even with custodial solutions people can trust that their currency won't inflate indefinitely which is a huge feature. Bitcoin still needs to become idiot proof which I think a lot of people in the space currently don't understand.
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:54:44

@_date: 2017-12-05 01:08:00
Think of it like this, if you put the money in a savings account, it is sure to go down over the years he is growing up due to inflation. However if you put it into bitcoin, it has the change to grow to a large sum of value. We know for sure that the value of the dollars in a savings account will diminish as inflation continues on...but with bitcoin...who knows? I'd buy bitcoin. Even if you lost it all, the child has his whole life to make it back up. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:24:07
I am really surprised this doesn't have more comments.  I don't pretend to be an expert, but I will just bring up some points. 
Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital asset that cannot be simply copied and pasted.  It exists outside the sphere of governments and institutions, and as such is an uncorrelated asset. Governments really can't stop the spreading of software, so banning it will never truely work.  Since bitcoin is limited in supply and is anti inflationary in nature, bitcoin can act as an interesting hedge against markets that relate to one another. Such as the forex markets.  Bitcoin really is the first permissionless global currency.
Bitcoin allows you to accept trading funds from underdeveloped nations since many in those nations don't have any real banks or provable identity. 
Sure wallets could be stolen, but it is quite hard if you set up the wallet right and store your bitcoins in multiple ways.  Furthermore, Bitcoin is programable money. You can program bitcoin to do a lot of cool things!

@_date: 2019-07-25 12:15:44
I don't think it makes sense to make this a "Conservative vs Liberal" argument. For example Rep. Brad Sherman has called for an outright Bitcoin ban for a long time and he is a democrat from California.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:16:27
I think bitcoin needs a better logo and symbol. I'm glad people like you attempt to produce a new logo. Can you attempt to make the new bitcoin logo more readable? I think that will help a lot. Also ignore the negativty. Keep attempting to create something better. I'm rooting for you hombre

I actually agree with with you despite everyone elses opinion being the reverse typically. The US has strategically positioned its allies and can basically fight economic proxy wars without barely lifting a finger. For example the US has strategically given power to a few individuals in Saudi Arabia, who are easy to control and loyal to the US as they lose their power without the US. The house of Saud effectively fights Iran at every turn in the middle east. In Europe the EU has NATO protecting all of it from Russia. Russia acts tough, but at the end of the day which country has military bases only several hundred miles from their enemies capitol? Russia has only two international ports left, and they both can easily be blockaded. In the East, the US has strategic alliances with Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and the Phillipines, each of these countries are rich due to the US's partnerships with them, and they all serve as military points from which the US could easily launch strikes. Furthermore it is in the economic interest of countries that rely heavily on shipping lanes like Australia to align themselves with the US.  You can see a lot of the countries voting habits in the UN coincide with where they recieve their oil from.  Sure their politicians will vote against the US in minor rulings from time to time, but it is rare to see them vote against the US in very serious rulings. The US has this power from a combination of geography and years of strategic alliances.

If I were him this is what I probably would have said: 
To all of you who are offended, this is what I want you to do:  Stand up, grab a 10 dollar bill, open your front door, walk out your front door, close your front door, walk to your car, unlock your car, get in your car, turn on your car, drive your car to your nearest grocery store, get out of your car, walk into the grocery store, walk to the ice cream section, grab a 5 gallon tub of your favorite ice cream, purchase the ice cream, walk back to your car, get in your car, drive your car home, walk up to your front door, open your front door, walk into your house, close your front door, walk back to where you were sitting, open the ice cream container, use your hands to scoop the ice cream into your mouth while sobbing uncontrollably. Cry about it. Feel better.
Edit: To those of you who I've offended because you are: lactose intolerant, don't like ice cream, don't have 10 dollars, don't have a viable means of transportation, can't read, don't have a front door, don't have a house, or don't have hands to scoop ice cream with, I just wanna say I apologize.

Only problem is I'm less likely to tip if its a dollar every tip.  Some people obviously deserve to be tipped a lot while some I just wanna tip a little.

It could go down. But there are very few assets you could ever own that have the potential to grow exponentially. You could sell it and have what? $400 dollars? How happy will that money make you? Sure maybe if you are on the verge of personal economic collapse maybe then you should sell if you have a family to support.  You are one of the few people now who have a significant chunk of an immutable financial ledger.  The satisfaction of what $400 dollars could get you today is not anywhere near the pain it would be if this asset grew exponentially.

Satoshi Nakamoto created the most significant invention of the 21st century that will change the world forever and has allowed for sweet give aways like this to take place. One day a bitcoin will be worth a ton of money and this thread will be awesome to look back at. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:30:48
It's a lot of fun to watch.

Your commas and periods confuse me. O_O
@_date: 2019-03-18 12:28:51
I don't have the answer, but I am interested to see what others say. Bitcoin still needs to become more user friendly within many of its wallets.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:14:15
Theymos is known to have acquired tens of thousands of BTC... so I would say that is a fair statement. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 15:01:01
I am a bit confused, is that a candy dispensor?
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:03:44
Theres a website that addresses that: bitcoinsperperson.com
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:41:35
I can teach you. 
@_date: 2019-03-30 19:53:04
Really? I didn't receive one? What was the title of the email?
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:59:46
Do you have a link to this card? Is this the square one?
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:50:39
How much for one?
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:32:05
Its impossible for bitcoin to go to zero....because I'll buy them all up first just for the hell of it...
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:45:47
My friend let me tell you something. Very few assets have the power to grow exponentially in life. Now I'm not telling you to put all your money in one basket, but you are young! You have plenty of time to pull in much more money than 20k! I'd take the risk and atleast buy some bitcoin. The problems of today will one day be solved, I believe it because I see more and more talent being drawn to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:19:10
R u okey?  
@_date: 2019-03-30 22:14:24
Oh strange I didn't received any emails from Feb-March, just from the comments in this thread, it sounds like a lot of users are having different problems with Bitpay.
@_date: 2019-03-01 13:00:31
I can't believe Russia does so much volume
@_date: 2019-03-29 03:50:59
Yeah it sounds cool, I like seeing some cool excel sheets like that!
@_date: 2019-03-30 19:44:48
I typically use Bitpay to pay on my credit card. I havent had any problems yet with ACH transfers and I was able to pay a day or two ago. I can confirm though that I've never received an email from them and I have never deleted any emails from them either. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:26:54
Why did they ban bitcoin cash? Whats the point?
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:17:41
How does this game work?
@_date: 2016-06-29 01:02:18
@_date: 2016-06-06 20:31:16
lol so...if I put the minimum.... I will always lose? xD
@_date: 2016-06-25 01:21:44
@_date: 2019-03-03 13:39:23
I think we should just do a small s with a horizontal line through it. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 01:15:32
What is this and how to get?
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:44:05
You should try listing them on amazon too. Could help spread awareness.

There are a lot of paid shills in this comment section jeeesh!
@_date: 2019-03-07 23:30:58
Nice art!
@_date: 2016-06-29 01:05:14
Yes. We need videos that put bitcoin stuff into layman's terms.
@_date: 2016-06-30 01:28:46
Could you sell the excess electricity back to the company and then exchange the fiat for bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-11 00:04:59

Count me in.
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:26:49
If you don't own any bitcoin, I say now is as good as ever to get involved.  This is still just the tip of the iceberg in my opinion. I say this believing that one day a bitcoin will be worth a lot of money.  If you already own a significant amount of bitcoin, then perhaps it is best to wait for a price drop. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 12:01:53
Do you have a template of the excel sheet? That sounds really cool
@_date: 2016-06-12 13:21:29

The larger the marketcap/ecosystem grows the less volitile it becomes. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 12:26:49
This is just my general observation, but the gender gap of bitcoin seems to correlate with the gender gap of traditional finance.

They are too difficult to submit papers to. They refuse to look at papers that aren't in 'academic' format.  
I don't know why academia always has a aura of smugness about them. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:32:11
its okay.
@_date: 2018-10-02 00:12:25
I love seeing these types of projects!!
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:26:49
...I had to try lmao
@_date: 2016-06-12 13:31:45
I would say, if you have no bitcoins, it is better to buy. But if you already have bitcoins it is good to wait.
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:45:27
Xapo released a debit card before them althought I dont think it was avaliblein the USA. Not sure if theywere the first ones though.

Yeah I agree, what does it indicate?
@_date: 2016-06-26 23:18:53
I understand what you are saying, but if they are not receiving too many papers, they should at least read the ones submitted even if its not formatted correctly. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:39:20
...Does what he said not seem weird to you? Am I the only one here? lmaooo
@_date: 2017-01-07 20:35:43
You've come full circle when you dream of big bitcoin crashes rather than rises.
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:40:54
I don't believe them.
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:38:04
So I am a bit confused and I am hoping someone can explain it to me simply. So Bakkt will be accepted by Starbucks and companies like it for in store payments....and will also be used for futures contracts..? So it is a payment processor and a exchange?
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:35:59
Neat. Can you pm me?
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:00:13
These have 1000 BTC on them each?
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:26:26
Oh I get that, I was hoping for some cool story examples haha
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:07:01
I saw a poll for this once. It showed that the average bitcoin user was between 18 and 45, with the majority being around 32 years old.
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:57:40
yeah dude. Its cool. It's kinda like playing a video game except if you win you can buy cars and shit. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:55:50
The difference is though, I don't use it for anything but bitcoin, so I won't be downloading any viruses right?
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:04:59
Yeah I agree with you. No one is obligated to type a response. It's better to say nothing than to be a smug asshat. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:06:11
Interesting. I like to see notable figures mention bitcoin. I've been making a list actually of many major world heads who have mentioned it.
@_date: 2018-10-28 00:26:35
Dude the game hasn't even started yet.  Get in while you can. You mileswell buy in anyways, if you cost average now the price would only have to go back to around 8k to make a profit. 
In 2014 to 2016 nearly nothing happened, it was Lonng and booorinnggg. Stop and think, is this currency useful?? Not just to you personally, but to other humans on planet earth that DON'T have the same birthright fortune as you.  Second... is the technology of this currency evolving? 
If you answer yes to both of these questions then it is a good idea. You aren't dumb. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:32:56
Will this account work like Coinbase's account where funds are stored in Bitcoin and can be spent with a Shift card?  Also is this account anonymous?

@_date: 2017-01-11 13:33:30
The growth of technology and adoption is exponential not linear. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:59:25
I remember seeing that. Obama made it sound like a Swiss bank account was a bad thing hahaha and all I could think was: 'Thats Great!!'

Where are you guys located?
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:00:25
Yeah theres too many idiotic zealots here. I get mad at them too and I've been here for years. They always speak so condescendingly and act as if bitcoin is user friendly. It's not user friendly, there's a learning curve. It may be easy to them now, as it is for me now, but they need to realize that its not easy for new users. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:15:08
That first article I'm reading calls it "BitCoin" every single time. It's making me cringe. lmao
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:14:03

Uhh... I don't think I'm the one that doesn't understand sarcasm. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:54:49
Its awful that these things happen to honest traders.
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:02:49
"The worst part about bitcoin imho is the community" 
I agree, its a bit toxic.
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:17:27
How vulnerable is a cold wallet that is connected to the internet for only a few minutes at a time? 
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:40:55
If you are young...go for it my friend. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:28:11
I'm seeing these slowly emerge but I still think we need really awesome wallet designs that simplify bitcoin and make it cool to look at. Wallets like electrum and core still look so old. We need more wallets that look really futuristic sort of like Bitpays wallet. 
There are many other things in the way of mass adoption but I've been dying for a bitcoin wallet that actually makes me feel like I'm living in the year 2145. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 01:38:36
Will the wealth of all who own Euro's just disappear?
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:17:50
Once you believe in it, you dream of price crashes so that you can buy more.

Bitcoin consultancy? How do you get into that?
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:57:03
It looks cool. We need more cool bitcoin art. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:25:42
Bitcoin isn't volatile; its markets are. We've decided that traditional banking is bad and obsolete, but we're still submitting ourselves to archaic, traditional markets. Have a look at LZF.com - they're trying to address this problem the smart way.
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:39:25
This is creepy. Without reading any comments I put in my guess of $987, I then scroll down and read your guess you posted hours ago which is exactly the same as mine. We are thinking exactly a like.  lmao
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:47:03
Some Euros will find their way to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:52:15
Oh I see. Hey thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:09:05
Some of these addresses are zombie addresses that haven't moved since 2010 and probably can't even be accessed.

I am not saying that infidelity is right, because it isn't, but you have a good point. Marriage is rigged against men. The design now forcably removed resources from men and gives it to women, which will result in a cultural decline. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:37:28
Price will be $986
Edited cause $987 was already taken
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:35:01
o_o  .... this was weird to read.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:55:28

The price started dropping when memes were severely limited and a few people starting constantly whining about people talking about price. 'can we plssss stop talkin about priceee?' 'can we plszssss stop with the memessss?'

People come here for big news and lolz.

@_date: 2019-08-14 22:55:29
There is no evidence that people will stay home and be lazy either.  We are assuming that millions will jump into new professions. It is quite clear that the bar is rising higher and higher for entry level positions.  Once it was possible to get a job with no education, now a high school diploma is minimum.  It is not crazy to assume that eventually a BA degree with become the minimum. Some people will simply not be able to make it. 1 in 10 Americans IQ are already too low to even serve in the modern military. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:39:48
Lmao...is this for real?
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:24:15
Funding it with inflation would imply that they will print more money to cover the costs - which they won't.  They are simply taxing companies to cover the costs. Say what you want, but that's not how inflation works. The money is already in existence and in circulation, the only difference is it is in the hands of large corporations. 
Even if you disagree with the plan, it isn't going to cause inflation.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:22:26
That's probably not the reason. The biggest reason is the economic output of China. The US would never need to invade china, it only needs to be able to block its ports from international trade. It helps that the US has allies and military bases located on the islands surround chinas economic zones (Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Phillipines, etc) The US then only has to wait until the average chinese citizen begins questioning the ruling communist party.  The communist party remains in power as long as they produce results, which is what they have consistantly done. When they stop doing that for an extended period of time, that is when they begin to have problems. 
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:46:07
Neither of these studies lasted long enough to bring conclusive data.  People with disability aren't exactly the best comparison either considering many of them can't work physically or mentally and those that can often can't work full time.  
Some people are unable to contribute to the modern economy in any real meaningful way as they would simply slow down our economy.  And that is okay.
“We just don’t have any data to know whether it was working or not.”
"With improvements seen in those areas in just a year, it’s clear that more investigation is needed before final conclusions can be drawn, with the preliminary results offering something for advocates and critics of basic income alike."
In your world view, the free market will create many new jobs that will replace current jobs.  In my world view, AI and automation will grow exponentially putting many out of work and causing huge job loss to those unable to adapt unless they receive help.  
I don't think either of us are irrational to have these world views.

Yes this is partnership with Starbucks who they list as their biggest partner.
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:18:36
Theres a lot of trashing this guy in this subreddit. His words are mostly taken out of context. His views on bitcoin are mostly a hands off approach meaning that he isn't saying bitcoin will or will not succeed, rather that it is an amazing economic phenomenon to watch. I took his free classes online, he really is a humble and good guy who knows a lot about markets. 
@_date: 2019-08-08 12:18:03
Your switch from commas to periods in your numbers is confusing.

The biggest drop is only 7%? haha wow bitcoin can do that in under 5 minutes and then proceed to do a 20% run up the next hour.
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:32:42
I am confused, what is the significance to this? How does it help get around taxes?

Half of Russia's government funding comes from oil/gas production.  When they can't export their oil/gas at decent rates they severely decline.

Thinking of it like this.... the money you have invested probably wouldn't change your life  much. However if bitcoin takes off, it could change your life dramatically.
If bitcoin goes to 0, you'll still be a broke college kid. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:43:34
I completely agree. Its a mature trait more people need to have.

Some people spend their money on really stupid things. Like indescribably stupid things.  Atleast with bitcoin it has the power to grow exponentially, unlike chocolate cheesecake which just grows your waistline.  Just don't put yourself in a dangerous situation.
@_date: 2015-08-07 01:31:45
I think he is saying that bitcoin is the answer to this article.

I see your point but he doesn't have to sell though, he can just commit to holding on for the long term. All or nothing, few other assets have the potential to rise dramatically like that. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 16:11:12
This is bitcoin right now.

Bitcoin is still far from mainstream.

Government's have to wage war on cash to stay in power.  Once negative interest rates hits the average consumer, people will begin to horde their money in safes rather than banks. Which will cause a economic crisis and a lot of bad things from the government's perspective to happen. Governments want cash eliminated so that consumers will be forced to accept the negative interest rates.

You do if you want to send currency to people across the world in China or Vietnam or Germany, etc. Sending mone from the USD to other currencies isn't always fun. It could have a lot of loops to jump through. Plus Paypal requires personal information, it has age restrictions, account restrictions etc. Bitcoin doesn't have any of that. It's very permissionless  and easy to use. No one can ever freeze your account and stop your funds from sending. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:41:13
One of the best ways to prevent bots and HFT would be to have incentives aligned that would make it too expensive to do. I remember one exchange, lzf.com attempts to prevent HFT with its exchange engine. I dont know if any other exchanges have been developed like lzf but using an exchange engine like theirs would prevent High frequency trading from happening.

@_date: 2017-09-30 16:28:46
Bitcoin is not a fiat currency because it is not backed by any central government and the amount of bitcoins in circulation will not continue to go up. Eventually the rate at which bitcoin deflates will become slower and slower thus providing stability. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:46:28
What is the significance of this?
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:45:12
People will want to use bitcoin first as a store of value as prices go up, and then as a form of payment as price stabilizes. Some people recognize that as the USD continues to inflate, the USD will become worth less and less. All fiat currency eventually returns to its original value, which is 0. As fiat currencies become worth less and less, some individuals see that bitcoin is not inflating and thus may decide to park some of their funds in bitcoin. Bitcoin is useful because it is like cash for the internet. Unlike traditional systems that need a bank as a middle man, bitcoin utilizes no middle man, which means a bitcoin wallet cannot be frozen and the funds can never be stopped from being sent. Whereas with banks funds can be frozen and stopped. Bitcoin is also universal since there is no centralized government attached to it. Meaning one bitcoin can be spent and accepted in Japan as easy as it could be in the USA. Someone with a smartphone in India can just as easily set up a bitcoin wallet just as easily as they could in Europe. Setting up a bitcoin wallet requires no one's permission unlike the traditional banking system. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:27:57
I think your math is off. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:56:16
Nah the USD would still be fine, the bitcoin marketcap would only be $2 Trillion dollars worth. Gold's is around $8 Trillion dollars worth right now so its not that crazy to imagine it co-existing with the dollar.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:38:06
This ad was back in 2014 when it was basically free to sends a bitcoin transaction. Times have changed since then but it is immensely easier for two bitcoin users to send payment to one another, they dont even need to known one another they simply need a bitcoin address.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:15:49
I know lots of people who held on that long....
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:00:38
As investment in bitcoin grows, the prices of bitcoin should stabilize as it would take a larger amount of money to move the market. For example to move a market price up 10% with a marketcap of $10 million dollars would require someone with approximately $1 million dollars to buy into the market. To move a marketcap with $10 Billion dollars invested 10% would require someone to buy in with approximately $1 Billion dollars. As the bitcoin economy grows larger it will become harder and harder to move the market. Earlier investors who have seen their investments grow and have become tiresome of waiting will trade their bitcoins first for goods and services. As prices move slower and slower and as individuals become older, people will begin trading their bitcoins for goods and services.

I mean, that's assuming bitcoin has no use-case and thus no value...which it does have a use-case an a value because it's the first digital asset that can't be copy and pasted. It's a transact-able token that can be sent to any address without knowing anything about a person. Plus anyone can look at the source code if they want to, unlike Bernie Madoff's fund.

Bitcoin is the first asset on the internet that cannot be copy and pasted. It makes it easy to send money over the internet. You don't have to know me to be able to send money to a bitcoin address. 
Yet sending me 100 Yuan is extremely hard and requires personal information. I think this is why people like bitcoin. Its a currency for the internet.

You are young. Very few assets in life have the power to grow exponentially like bitcoin does. Very few assets are so limited like bitcoin is. Bitcoin isn't like an apple stock or any other stock. Its a global digital currency that never sleeps. Unlike the stock market, bitcoin markets never stop. It goes 24/7, 365.  It never sleeps. Few assets are so permissionless and global! Do it. What do you have to lose? You are young, you have no morgage, no wife, no kids! You are a blank slate! Make use of that advantage.

If you go on bitfinex you'll get BT1 and BT2. If you sell your BT2 for btc you'll get the money. You can then split them again. You just cant take out the BT1 and exchange it for bitcoin until the coin forks. So your BT1 will be subject to counterparty risk for weeks. But if you need the money its worth it imo.

It should take a trillion dollar marketcap for each bitcoin to be worth $62,000. 
1,000,000,000,000 / 16,000,000 = $62,000
So it would be less than 2 trillion dollar marketcap.

If they are on an exchange they are not safe, you don't 'own' the coin while it is sitting on the exchange, coinbase does...That being said 1 coin isn't that big of a deal. It depends how much you feel like inconveniencing yourself over a few hundred dollar investment.

The activity feed pops up too much its annoying. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:05:58
You missed an exchange: LZF.com it's available in more states than Gemini and coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:01:27
What do they think of LZF.com and their new incentive algorithm?

Everyone is anticipating an immediate price rise, if it doesn't rise, people will lose hope and then sell their coins which will drive the price down.

Hey its my Birthday today on the 24th of May and Bitcoin has hit $2400!! Haha :D
@_date: 2016-05-23 14:03:45
I would try Bitpay or maybe even give Bitwala a try.
@_date: 2017-07-01 11:28:12
I'm interested in pictures too! Looking at different setups is really cool to me. :)
@_date: 2016-05-01 00:08:48
Is this legit?
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:21:06
lmao that part threw me off too. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:00:30
This server is in beta, but its pretty awesome. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 21:07:29
You can receive as many transactions as you want safely, but the security of the address is diminished if you sign and publish multiple transactions from said address. i.e., after you spend the bitcoins from an address, you should use a new address to receive new payments but until you spend from it, you can safely receive payments indefinitely. Having said that, this kind of attack is mostly theoretical and an open research topic.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:50:55
Yeah but they wont be able to do that anymore...so how will we pay for the roads?
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:58:52
$10,000 in 2018. $50,000 in 2019
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:22:09
What happened last time?
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:08:46
Id like to see a 2017 version of this updated to see what its lost since 2013
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:26:21
Yeah same, I feel like I've been waiting forever for it to happen at this point.  But when it finally does, that will be cool.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:36:09
Amazon accepts bitcoin directly?
@_date: 2016-07-19 20:40:31

Why Friday at 8pm?
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:57:52
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:40:27
Yeah sure, I'd love to take a look. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:42:35
If you own no bitcoins now is the best time to strike. If you do own bitcoins...you can afford to wait.
@_date: 2016-07-01 15:21:05
Every bit will be worth a dollar? O_O

I didn't know Liberia was cold, I thought it was close to the equator?
@_date: 2016-07-05 01:20:59
Oh Id like to see a desktop bitcoin wallet that has a really nice artistic designed. Most bitcoin wallets look really basic and dull. Id like to see one that looks like its from the future.
@_date: 2016-07-06 01:13:01
Unless he wrote down the password somewhere. Id search his stuff for a password. Id also search his hard drive for a program like keepass. The password might be on there. Youll still have to find a password though.
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:03:35
I mean, if you got into bitcoin 10 years ago, then it was the best performing asset of the decade. Lmao
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:00:09
Do you have the private key? If you have the wallet backup youll be okay. Unless your bitcoins were stored on a website?
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:21:13
@_date: 2018-12-26 02:16:11
This is cool.
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:05:36
@_date: 2016-07-25 00:48:41
If this bitcoin thing ever takes off...It will be worth a lot of money. Very few assets have the potential to have exponential growth, bitcoin is one of them. Heres one article. 
imo 1 mil is kinda high but I won't say its impossible.

@_date: 2019-05-23 15:01:38
Awesome haha!  What do you do for a bitcoin career?
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:13:20
My girlfriend was with me when a friend talked about bitcoin and cryptocurrency online. We read the same articles and saw how some people were making money.  Yet right now I've gotten into cryptocurrency and she hasn't.  I read about cryptocurrency all the time and she says its cool but she simply isn't really interested. I even try to get her more involved sometimes but she just isn't into it.  
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:13:11
Huzzah. 6.25 here we come!
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:08:27
Huzzah! The Halvening has arrived!
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:56:16
In my honest opinion,
I think it would be wise to get rid of the Guy Fawkes mask.  The Guy Fawkes mask is hard to take seriously, develop a new symbol to rally behind.  We need to separate the image of bitcoin away from drugs/illegal stuff as much as we can. When promoting bitcoin, remember that bitcoin is for everyone, not just libertarians. I see a lot of people try to put their beliefs and political views on top of bitcoin. We need everyone to use bitcoin and we don't want to turn people off to the idea of bitcoin before they even take a look at it.
@_date: 2016-07-06 02:36:20
Lol chill.

@_date: 2019-05-12 03:27:55
You must be fun at parties my dude.
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:09:55
Thats an interesting way of looking at it lol. How will we pay for our roads?
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:39:24
Bitpay also has a visa debit card.
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:59:33
I love seeing bitcoin show up in tv shows.
@_date: 2016-07-30 01:32:18
What is this?
@_date: 2016-07-19 01:27:29
lmao. xD
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:20:41
You are saying the average person doesnt have 2k in dollars of net worth?
@_date: 2016-07-07 00:06:13
Haha yeah. Dont come to my town though ill buy it in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:36:34
You're not that late...bitcoin's marketcap is only 10 billion right now.
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:35:38
Thanks! Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:23:01
Was a genuine question...
@_date: 2016-07-10 16:21:11
See you there.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:38:05
My word of advice is this: when you invest, invest for the long term. See bitcoin for its future potential and not always its current potential. It is an ongoing project so don't be dismayed if it takes time to see its full growth.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:15:50
Institutional funds are buying bitcoin for their clients who are asking for it. This worked until Bitcoin OTC started to dry up.  Now that the OTC coins are drying up, funds have to place market orders on exchanges. This causes demand to go up and thus the price.
@_date: 2016-07-17 02:02:29
Try Bitpay or Bitwala or Xapo. But im not sure what the fees are.
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:52:37
Its been a lonnggg journey! Congrats!
@_date: 2016-07-15 03:19:56
Lol if bitcoin tanks I will purchase a ton of bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-07-08 21:15:33
Yeah...what ever happened to changetip?
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:40:25
Thanks Fren! :]
@_date: 2016-07-30 17:47:25
Its much better than it was before! I think it looks particularly nice next to the subscribe button when you watch a video. Keep spreading the word about bitcoin. I'm glad people like you do what you do. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:41:09
Lolol yes.
@_date: 2016-07-08 13:49:27
Lol thats pretty crazy that the creator of the program doesnt know where it gets its predictions at lolol
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:24:29
I love seeing this kind of stuff. Thanks for posting. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:08:21
Goodluck! May the odds be in your favor!
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:36:27
Yeah just like everyone who bought in at $200 dollars after Mt. Gox is just 'lucky'  hahaha Bitcoin was so small and clunky then in many ways. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 23:50:34
Anyone know where I can read more about this subject at?
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:32:50
I've noticed the exact same thing. Just a coordinated downpour of accounts making negative comments. I bet they are downvoting this post right now.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:06:34
Oh try bitpay or lzf.com for the merchant API that can easily be intergrated.
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:44:40
I hope for your success! Cheers!
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:57:28

I agree 100%. The wallets need to look like they are from the future not the past.
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:07:29
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:45:25
Lmaoo 
I like that this subreddit is slowly becoming funny again.
People were getting too serious before.
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:50:24
Such a dank meme, bull market confirmed.
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:33:17
I think the view towards bitcoin and distributed ledgers was more positive rather than negative.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:23:36
That was crazy to watch. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 00:12:17
I like the idea. It's interesting, I hope book worms use it. I like that there is a night mode. Here's one random feature you might want to implement in the future; I'd like to be able to highlight a word and have the definition of the word come up on the right or left hand side. Sometimes when reading a difficult book, I have to stop and look up the definition of certain words, having the function within the book application would save me time. I'm on a PC right now though so I'm not sure how it would work on a tablet or mobile device.  I'd also like to be able to highlight parts of the book when reading (sometimes I highlight line per line while I read). Another idea you could do far in the future is have each book link to a discussion board where readers of the book can talk to one another about aspects of the book along with a review section.  Also maybe in the far future, pick 3-5 books and let the community vote on which one is selected next. - Paperback Gorilla is a good name. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:26:41
I thought they had units even smaller than the penny...like half cents and 1/10th a cent?
@_date: 2016-07-31 18:03:02
Oh, okay.

@_date: 2016-07-19 20:20:54
I liked a lot of the shots at the end with the fiat money creation and the nice looking bitcoin mining rigs. The video picked up pretty good at the end. Overall it is a decent ad. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:31:28
You are technically right yes lol
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:21:37
I see this guys face come up on this subreddit all the time. Each time I wodner, what is that mark on his forehead?
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:01:54
Lmao thanks I was really confused! Same thing happened to me!
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:45:44
This is horrible.  This would easily get a bunch of noobs. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:29:55
Oh try Bitpay debit card.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:37:24
I didn't even know Macedonia had enough time to pay attention to and ban bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:49:25
This is really cool! Thanks for posting this!
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:39:34
Yeah this sub is finally turning around in terms of memes. I remember when they were nearly banned for a while lmao
