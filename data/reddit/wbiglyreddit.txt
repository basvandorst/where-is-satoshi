Flip side is not enough money and having your economy stop because you ran out of money.  The US did that back in the 70s which was why it went off the gold standard.  They had to borrow Swiss francs to pay bond obligations.  Why any government would want to go down that path again knowing its an inevitability is a great question.

So why doesn’t this show on the rest of the worlds bitcoin websites?  I’m seeing $6200+ as the current price.  If BTC is commanding $24000 there, what’s keeping those purchasers from the other markets?

That kind of explains some of the situation, thank you.  But what keeps local citizens from going to some btc vendor say in Hong Kong, Russia or other jurisdiction amenable to trade with them and paying retail in existing currency?  Or is their currency so in trouble that even their allies won’t respect it?  Conversely, if demand is that high, why is btc price going down?  
Learning a lot here, I appreciate the feedback.

Sure it isn’t 8400 of local currency?  There are news reports of BTC trading at $24000, but that isn’t showing on CoinMarketCap.  So unless “$”  stands for something other than US dollars, these news reports are bogus.

Folks are waiting for the anticipated drop to $3000.

The one I saw in the US was obscene - it was charging 50% over market price as a fee.

Hope that helps.  It’s an advert, be aware.
@_date: 2018-10-31 18:20:27
Good news!  It’s not around $6400 any more.
Bad news =\ It’s less than $6400 now.

I’m asking as well.  Way back when this all first started, the fees from the brokerages were unreasonable. I was going to buy some from a bitcoin ATM, but their bid I ask was 50% of the purchase price! At the time they wanted $1200 for $800 in coin.
Never went back to that ATM.
When I checked out COINBASE originally, I was seeing similar stories about excessive fees and or bid ask spreads being exorbitant as well.  (The inability to get anybody on the phone was also another reason to stay away).
So I’m just asking questions here to see if anything’s changed.

Do the math and in 30 transactions more than half your money is gone at just 1.5%.!
That’s what makes fees in 401k’s so onerous.

Whoever has the lowest fees/charges/etc.
Also - is there a bid/ask spread on the actual transaction for BTC?
If so, how much?

Who said anything about day trading?
Am I teaching someone here?
I said you’ll lose more than half your money after 30 transactions with a 1,5% fee.  
It doesn’t make any difference if you do them in the space of minutes, months or years - or didn’t you know that?
That’s why I mentioned 401k’s - so many people are oblivious to that danger of fees.
After 30 years with 1,5% fees, your broker makes more money out of the deal than you do.
Compounding is a two edged sword.

Hodlers.  Your spellcheck probably changed it.

What about dollar cost averaging?

Bravo! Well Stated.

Appreciated.

Yes,  But if you know anything about Agora Publishing you’d understand the question.  
What I’m getting is that he is the sole source on this story, no one else is carrying it.  So either it’s a nothing story, or it’s very confidential information he’s gotten hold of.
If he turns up dead like one of their former contributors, William Colby, we’ll have a better understanding of the nature of his warning.
Thanks for the reply.

Pump and dump back in operation.
