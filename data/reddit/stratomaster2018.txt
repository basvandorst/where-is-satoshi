Bitcoin is being held up at around $6,000-$6500 for a really long time now. The bottom could fall out at anytime BUT there are a lot of positive signs that were going to get a big pump in 2019 based on the flood of institutional interest, the approval of multiple crypto ETFs and more. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:08:20
This is a great idea! Is there a plan to allow for people to gift others using the same email-type system but send bitcoin they already own? The challenge is that its sometimes too difficult for others to understand the complexities of buying/storing bitcoin.

In the case of roubini, he receives a very generous weekly paycheck from a university that’s primary donors and partners are bitcoin’s main competition (banks and other financial companies). So, it’s no wonder he is so vehemothly against it! He’s being paid by its competition! 
@_date: 2018-10-31 14:09:37


I graduated from there. They offer the course because of demand. Mind you, each class runs about $6000, so there is financial incentive if there is demand from students. Since BTC has made people big $$, there is demand from students. There's no "conspiracy". Roubini is a proponent for status-quo economic theory. He received his training in it and gets paid handsomely to teach those theories. He has demonstrated that he doesn't understand the fundamentals of the technology. He uses personal attacks and childish language. It doesn't take conspiring for someone to feel threatened.
Aside from that, Roubini publishes books and trains entry-level bankers in traditional securities theorum. There is so much CLEAR ignorance and clear conflict of interest on this matter, it's ridiculous.

I have been buying up or down every week a few bucks and then $10 or $20 here or there. It adds up. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 03:28:11
Yeah. I wouldn’t be the lease surprised. It’s typical of the biggest haters to own some “just in case” or “I bought some to prove how bad of a system it is” something idiotic along those lines.

Wow really? Thanks so much.

Gold very easily. Oil is possible too. Crypto will never be completely anonymous either. There are a lot of silent nodes set up by governments to monitor what ip addresses transactions originate from and, no, a vpn wouldn’t do much for you either if someone really wanted to find out who is behind a crypto transaction. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 22:39:05
Yes I did and wow thank you so much! I will definitely recommend your service.

The difference is Iran is run by religious fundamentalists who will take death before giving up the sharia. North Koreans are brainwashed being raised in a completely insulated environment secluded from the world. Iranians just don’t care. “Give me sharia or give me death”

You’re a retard. You’re talking about a country that practically lives under sharia law. It’s an Islamic theocracy. In other words, a dictatorship. You can sugar coat it all you want. It doesn’t change the facts.

You misunderstand. They ban banks from processing payments from bitcoin exchanges to individual account holders. It’s not the banks themselves that had any part in using bitcoin but rather the customers of those banks. So, if you were an Iranian citizen and made money in bitcoin, your bank would not be able to process those deposits into your account.

False. Anyone that lives in the real world and goes to work everyday knows that less than 5% of people know what bitcoin is outside of “I’ve heard of it but don’t know much”. 1%-2% have invested and of those, approximately half are still in profits because they got in before 2017. I work at a large bank and almost none of my coworkers know what bitcoin is outside of millennials. All they know is what they’ve heard on CNBC or read on Bloomberg. Even then, my employer is HEAVILY investing in blockchain development because it’s common sense that decentralized hosting outside of just money transfers is going to be a very big part of the financial industry in 20-30 years. 
Databases weren’t immediately adopted either. There are STILL lots of companies that have everything on paper.

It is often difficult for people emotionally to lose. I think it’s hard for people to admit to themselves they were wrong . Even if they could afford to lose the money, it’s 1) ego and 2) greed that take over one’s psyche. Of course, there are plenty who invested more than they could afford to lose, but that isn’t everyone.

For the same reason sending crypto payments overseas is cheaper than any other form of remittance or banking fees. Fees are substantially lower when network maintenance is distributed among stakeholders and even further reduced by the fact that there is a lot of competition. On top of that, you have many of these projects being open source. The creators are rewarded if their tokens increase in value - not by payments from customers. So, the incentive is to gain market share by having the lowest cost and most reliable service.  
When Linux first started to become popular in the early 1990s, there was the same kind of skepticism. "Who will support it?" they asked. "It won't scale" they proclaimed. But now, every smartphone and many laptops are powered by these systems. It took linux from 1991-2010s to become "mainstream".

This is a delusion. There are lots of AI and Dapp protocols being developed on blockchain technology. Decentralized hosting is going to save a lot of web developers cash. Hosting is expensive. Artificial intelligence servers cost boatloads to run and using all that computing power of the blockchain to run AI projects is a no brainer. Large universities such as MIT have an insane amount of blockchain projects being done by graduate students. The technology is still very much in its earliest days. The internet took 20 years to start to see mass adoption.

I think the new SEC commissioner personally meeting with Bitcoin companies is very indicative that it will be passed.

Youll be able to once the ETF hits or you can gbtc. The problem with these secondary markets is they don't reflect the price of bitcoin accurately. Gbtc is down what 15% in the last month while Bitcoin hasn't moved. If an ETF is released, it may be a way for you to get in with less secondary market risk, but bro, if you want to hold btc hold real btc that's on chain. Anything off chain isn't btc.

The sanctions also apply to crypto transactions which are, for the most part, completely traceable. Remember, sanctions are not just in Iran but are on countries that transact with Iran. Other countries make accept gold payments, but crypto transactions ultimately need to be converted to fiat and that’s where it doesn’t work out. Let’s not forget that Bitcoin is the most traceable form of currency every produced and no, they won’t accept monero for oil.

I can send $100 overseas in BTC for about $.20 in fees. Western union would charge $10 plus fees. So, we’re talking an enormous saving by cutting out these middlemen. Foreign remittance is by far the biggest rip off on earth. Ever try a foreign wire transfer? They run $45-$65 depending on the bank. The fees are just outrageous. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:52:34
You do realize bitcoin has been going through this cycle for 10 years now, right? The business cycle is a part of life. Think about the tech bubbles in stocks - the 4 horseman, the dot com boom, faang stocks. Ups and downs are part of investing. Emotions shouldn’t play a part in this.

The federal reserve has effectively turned the dollar into a pyramid scheme through debasement and inflation. 2008 taught us that the citizens will be thrown under the bus to prop up the elites at any cost. A system like that is inherently unstable and it will not survive nearly as long as you believe. It’s already a situation where people avoid saving at all costs because of how quickly purchasing power is reduced . The only reason it’s used is because of legal tender laws. It will likely collapse and need to be replaced within our lifetime. It’s not sustainable and it’s on its last leg at this point.

No. They will not switch to crypto. Iran is a dictatorship and will continue to exercise strict capital controls over its citizens

Were you around at that time? Plenty of people said it’s too complicated for the average person and it’ll never make its way into private homes. They said the same about Linux up until 2010 and now you’re carrying Linux in your pocket, in your watch, etc. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:54:27
I heard the same argument about Linux since the 1990s and about tcp/ip - “it will never become mainstream”. 30 years later, just about every single person on earth is running tcp/ip and android/iOS in their pocket.

This is a assumption that can’t be proven until blockchain is successful without bitcoin. So far, every blockchain project is measured and trashed against bitcoin. bitcoin is also the most successful blockchain project for 10 years running. It’s not going anywhere and will always be seen a novelty.

Every institutional buy is going through Gemini. They have the most legitimate and trusted exchange in the world right now. Courts exist to remedy crimes like theft. So, it has nothing to do with the business acumen and everything to do with recovering stolen assets from a convicted felon.

It was originally very libertarian but I guess once you get lots of adoption you get the masses who are typically somewhere in the middle. Surprised to see no leftists. I guess they don't like money lol

So, you can run AI processes on a distributed append file? That’s the first time I’ve heard that. Because other than blockchain, the only way I know of doing that is leasing cpu cycles from proprietary systems for exponentially higher costs. 
And what about hosting web apps? I pay $150 a month to Hostgator. Thanks to blockchain, those apps will soon cost 0 to host without worrying about scaling issues. 
There are thousands of applications of blockchain. You think corporations would be throwing hundreds of millions to develop blockchains if it didn’t have any promise? 
I wonder what you’d be saying about internet in 1992 “nobody will ever use tcp/ip. It’s too complicated for mass adoption. Blah blah blah”. I’ve heard the same argument for decades with different technologies. Blockchain and Bitcoin are both here to stay. It’s about time deniers start admitting facts to themselves. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, fidelity, nyse, etc. etc. - they’re not investing for fun. Everyone in the banking world is well-aware that blockchain is going to play an enormous role in finance over the next few decades.

Greed? What would you do if someone stole $30 million from you? Just call it a bad day? It's been proven on chain that the stole coins were spent to finance a VERY lavish lifestyle. If Shrem didn't try to live like a billionaire, they would have never went after him. He is also an idiot. Instead of using Monero or another privacy coin, he took the coins straight to coinbase and sold them, securing a solid trace back to him.
