Right but obviously the paper wallet has no computing power.  So the question is how is the change address generated?
I have a paper wallet with 1 BTC.  I spend 0.5 BTC somewhere.  At this point 0.5 BTC are being rerouted somewhere by some entity.  What process is determining what the address is?  I'm guessing that a private key already inherently has a defined set of change addresses in the same manner a deterministic wallet would work.  I would test this but I don't want to lose bitcoin in the process.

How could the wallet I imported to generate the change address when I never spent from that wallet?  Is it a deterministic thing based on the private key?

The headline is meant to be tongue in cheek since that's how most people compare value.

I don't understand the logic in downvoting this.  It's an art project, if you don't appreciate it simply move along.

Yeah yeah.  The point is that certain people are well placed to make big moves if they're supporters of bitcoin.

So once I have a private key, all future change addresses derived from that key on any number of computers or paper wallets using that private key will always have access to any change addresses ever created?  Like a deterministic wallet would work.
PhlegmFeltcher's comment pretty much sums it up.

Why is this being downvoted?  I'm curious as well.

Is it more profitable to trade on the exchange than whatever their current rate is?
