Say current price of bitcoin is around $17,200. Now imagine investors have put out a "buy order" totaling 500 bitcoins at the price point of $17,000. This means they are willing to buy 500 bitcoins at $17,000. If the price of bitcoin goes down to $17k, the buy wall starts eating up any bitcoins put up for sale. Until this "wall" of buy orders is fulfilled, the price of bitcoin will not go below $17k. Hence, the Buy wall prevents price of bitcoins dipping below $17k. A sell wall operates similarly, but prevents price going beyond the sell wall.
Hope that makes sense.

**Disclaimer** These are all my personal opinions. 
**What is the main reason behind BTC's price surge?** 
*FOMO (Fear of missing out). People see the price of BTC climbing higher and higher, and encouraged by the bullish sentiment around Bitcoin in general they are either holding onto what they have, and/or trying to buy as much as they can. 
Many people believe the Nov 14 fork will be a repeat of Bitcoin Cash, ala free money.*   
**Why so many people are suddenly interested in BTC is it because of the profit or because of BTC core technology.**
**What happens if there is huge crash at this point?** 
*Mainstream adoption of bitcoin/cryptocurrency will see a major set back.*
**What are the mainstream and primary use of BTC?** 
*Mainstream use of BTC is as a store of value (digital gold). Primary use is as a form of currency.*
