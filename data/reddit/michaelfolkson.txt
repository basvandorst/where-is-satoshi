Remember as a contractor/freelancer you can sign up for Bitwage's service and you can get paid a percentage (or all) of your salary in Bitcoin. Your employer does not need to be signed up to Bitwage

Hey Alex. Will you be partnering/integrating with other Lightning companies/services on launch or are you focused on what you can offer consumers as a standalone entity?

It is not possible on Reddit (or some other platform) to set up a channel where everyone who joins is in listen mode unless the admin gives them write privileges? I'm assuming you've tried this, otherwise I would try myself.

Bitcoin first have to be locked on the blockchain to use the Lightning Network. So it certainly doesn't replace it, it leverages it so that you can do theoretically an infinite number of transactions with only minimal footprint on the blockchain (opening and closing transaction).

My understanding is that this statement is related to establishing \*new\* connections not existing connections and channels. This won't break existing channels for example. can correct me if wrong.

I'm assuming the restrictions on when SIGHASH\_NOINPUT can be used will be coded up in the BIP e.g. "NOINPUT MUST NOT be used, unless it is explicitly needed for the application" rather than relying on miner enforcement. I'm struggling to understand how the code will deem whether NOINPUT is needed in the application or not.

That's what I would've thought. So there must only be a small number of limited use cases where the consensus rules will allow it to be used.

Ah so it is user beware. A user should follow this advice on when to use SIGHASH\_NOINPUT but the miners/network/consensus rules don't care. That's right yeah? Thanks that makes sense.

Agreed with what has written. But in response to the original question, no the person cannot delete the transaction from the mempool. There is no one mempool, every full node and miner maintains their own mempool. You would have to convince every full node and miner to extract the transaction from their mempool to delete it from every mempool which is not viable. To get it removed you would need to broadcast a transaction spending the same coins with a higher fee before it is included in a block or encourage miners to include the original transaction in a block using child-pays-for-parent.

Cool, thanks for correcting. GreenAddress and others too

Someone technical can easily do this. Someone non-technical wouldn’t be able to. There are no wallet interfaces that allow you to do this afaik.
