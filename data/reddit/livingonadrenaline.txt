Is there any way to increase your miner fee afterwards? I'm trying to send btc from 'Bread' to a pc wallet. The transaction has been stuck for 2 days now due to a low fee (high fee on Bread costs like $20 extra lol) so I'm wondering if there's anyway to increase the miner fee for the transaction. Thanks

Could anyone help me out regarding lost password for Multibit?  
I think I've been hacked, my pc (so far) shows it's clean but I can't access my Multibit wallet anymore. I have my wallet words to restore the wallet but the screen just simply stays on this:    for quite a while..anyone know what to do? If I've really been hacked I know my BTC is probably gone but I don't understand why my wallet words aren't unlocking my wallet..

I just want to give a warning that 'Bread' is pretty unstable for me. After nearly losing my coins due to a Multibit bug (password which always worked, suddenly refused to open wallet) I managed to recover them with Bread. Thanks to the developers of Bread for that!
However, sometimes when opening the wallet on Bread your balance won't show. Syncing your wallet doesn't work, and you have to delete/recover the wallet to get the btc to show. I think this is because Bread is probably in it's begin stages but imo it's not really reliable at the moment. Also the fact you can only chose 2 transaction fee's where the highest one is like $15-20 for a single transaction and the cheapest is around 0.50$ but takes serveral days (!!) to confirm. I don't want to be dissing Bread too much, but for me, as a relatively new user, I found it wasn't as reliable as I hoped.

Can someone help me? I sent some BTC from my bread wallet on mobile phone, to my electrum wallet. However the fee wasn't very high so it got stuck in the blockchain.. this is the transaction:
I proceeded with the CDFP method which I followed a tutorial described here:  
Yet it doesn't seem to work, no matter how high my transaction fees are. This is the wallet I'm sending it to: 
as you can see, last transaction I tried to spend as much as $37 on miner fee to get it through asap but my electrum wallet just states 5 transactions and none are confirmed. 
Did I do the CDFP method wrong? how can I get my btc back?
