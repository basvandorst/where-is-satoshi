Yeah, should have stuck with buttcoin's 60% loss, right guys? You genius! lololololololololol

lol buttcoin is actually the bottom of the barrel league, only suited for challenged "investors".

We're getting a raise soon too, cause our efforts are working and buttcoin's price is starting to circle the drain! Good job, team!

What you need is a CC. Or just go drink some water from the toilet bowl, you mouthbreather.

So jealous of your -60% in 12 months :) Even more jealous of the -99% coming soon. Enjoy homelessness, you idiots! :D

It's a utility failure. Buttcoin is useless, and your real money has been lost gambling on internet tokens. The Chinese thank you for playing the "game", loser.

If you like $440 you'll love $300! Then you'll cream you pants at $200! You'll go all in at $100! And then... suicide. And nothing of value will be lost.

And you'd be wrong. Which is kind of redundant, considering you're a bitcoiner. What a bunch of idiots :D

MPEx is an even bigger joke than buttcoin. So it's the perfect scam exchange for you geniuses.

Also, everybody who has bought in the last 6 months is in the red! Glorious bright red, like blood leaking from a mortal wound!

This dude didn't lose 60% in 12 months unlike you fools holding the bag lolololololol
@_date: 2014-09-10 12:22:47
Well, sure, but bundles of sticks can't understand basic english. So go easy on them.
