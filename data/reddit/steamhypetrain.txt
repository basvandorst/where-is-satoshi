1) Use adblock.  
2) Reddit doesn't need to know what fucking threads I visit to show my fucking upvotes, neither do random third parties. Hell, they probably don't need to even know which set of upvotes goes with which set of comments, as long as they can check whether I voted already when I want to vote.

The average is meaningless, thanks to spammers, companies that refuse to implement batching and the like.

They are asking how to avoid (regional) DNS spoofing when trying to reach clearnet sites. A VPN that provides DNS service for their endpoints will suffice. DNSCrypt should also be enough.

Yeah, couple days to do a simple transfer is too much but 24 hours is just fine. No, not really. Legacy banking is a joke.

The US is not the whole world.  


Crypto exchanges charge something like 0.2%.  


I have never seen a card with no exchange fees that doesn't cost money and/or come with an account that costs money. E.g. the Transferwise card charges 0.35-1%.  


Yes. You are being subsidized by everyone paying cash. (For now.) Good job.  


They don't need to be that high. If a 3rd party exchange can do it cheaper, the bank can as well.

How does it compare to the mid-market rate?

Last time I checked Facebook didn't have spyware preinstalled on most of consumer PCs. Can't say I care much about companies' policies (who even reads those?), unlike their actual actions.

I think most of the big Chinese miners are using hydro power.

Most banks and cards have shit conversion rates (hidden fees really).

Some regions have plenty of hydro:

Seeing individual Americans defend the tipping culture, a loophole that allows companies to get away with paying their employees basically nothing while passing the responsibility directly to the customer, is genuinely hilarious.
Do you also tip the pilot for not crashing the plane and the bus driver for opening the door at your stop? Maybe the police for not taking your property for arbitrary reasons?

Tradition of what? Anti-consumer practices?

Get a VPN (&lt;5 bucks a month) or look into DNSCrypt.

The exchange rate is important e.g. when you spend another currency than you get paid in. And I'm not talking about going to a brick and mortar exchange here, just an online one.
People bring up their "free" accounts and cards but most of the time it turns out they aren't really free, they are just easy to use... I googled the Chase card, apparently it has an annual fee? I question these fees because they are unnecessary, yet most banks still have them. You don't get shafted on the rate when you sell/buy your bitcoin (unless you use Coinbase or something).

If the only feature you need is watching videos, try NewPipe.

Haven't had it crash on me yet, but I don't really use it often.
