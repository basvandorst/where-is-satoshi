(nearly) 4 MB is a (very) expensive attack block. Can anybody tell me what the biggest block mined to date has been?
At the current rates of segwit usage, the biggest possible block currently is about 1.05 MB, after november it will be about 2.1 MB.

No one has taken over the project. Everyone remains free to follow whichever consensus rules they wish. Including 'corporations' engaged in economic activity. 
As it is, the plan of SW2X is to change the blocksize. Any other changes (like permissions) would require further forks and user consensus. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:36:03
Yes the method seems sound (to me). But who has implemented it, who has tested it? $4m is a lot of money for an experimental protocol.

I don't believe Mr Mayer has 25K BTC. I think anyone making these kinds of wild challenges should prove their holdings before they are taken seriously. This can be done very easily in zero knowledge (eg. with Provisions).

No on is 'taking over control of the network' - that's not possible. A group of 'corporations' subject to government regulations (as are you, me and Blockstream) have agreed to support a change in the consensus rules (i.e. a change of the base block size from 1MB to 2MB). They are planning on running the client that has implemented that change. 
This is it. No conspiracy. The businesses and miners who are going to do this are acting in their own self interest - to increase the value and utility of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:51:43
Doesn't it bother you that the entire thing is beholden to a particular implementation, controlled by a single group?
So as far as you are concerned, if the NYA signatories had all agreed to use a new non-core client - but with the same (1MB) consensus rules (which would be equally "firing core"), this would be equally considered a takeover?
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:16:52
It does not do provable privacy like with Monero or Zcash. It's 'hopefully' or 'probably' private depending on how decentralised the topology of the network ends up being. You have to assume the nodes routing the payment are not compromised and/or colluding.

"fake grassroots campaign"
Oh my. Wow. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:07:41
BTC1 forked the client (i.e. it is a different piece of software to the core client). This client is currently following the same consensus rules as core (1MB blocks), but come november will follow different consensus rules (a chain fork). 
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:58:50
3-4 MB blocks are not possible today. Go back and check your calculations.

We will. Thats the whole point.

The 2X hardfork would result in an average max blocksize of &lt; 4MB. By restricting the max number of peers, all of those connections would be capable of supporting a full node. It's not really that apocalyptic. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:09:45
According to the coinbase signalling, nearly all miners are (apparently) using it. Approx. 200 full nodes on the network are using it, but I think the latest version of core blocks them. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:50:57
I now have 3 full nodes running in my house. Everyone needs to do their bit.

Completely trustless atomic swaps have been possible between most assets for over 4 years (its a misconception that recent changes - i.e. segwit - have enabled them). What are you waiting for?

"But how is that different than fiat currency, where miners decide (by fiat) that your old bills are no longer valid?"
No 'bills' (tokens) will become invalid. If there are two chains, then all UTXOs are valid on BOTH chains. 
Either you wanted to give readers the impression that their bitcoins could be invalidated on the forked chain, or there is something very wrong with your understanding of the technology. Both possibilities are pretty shocking - which is it? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:10:46
Any links to Jeff spreading 'utter lies' about segwit?
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:48:52
How can you write what you just did and then call someone else stupid? 
Firstly the statement "everyone's choosing decentralized" is incoherent - it has no meaning. If you mean "everyone is choosing a 1MB" then it is so obviously incorrect, or we wouldn't even be having this discussion. 
No-one's trying to shut down your node. It will only accept blocks of the size you choose. However, given the level of understanding you seem to have about how this all works, I question the utility of you running a node at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:27:06
Massive blocks that no-one can afford to validate and store is as much of a straw-man argument as saying that you must therefore want 1 KB blocks so that everyone can validate but no-one can afford to transact. There is a trade-off between usability and decentralisation - and people disagree on where to strike that balance. IMO (based on technical considerations) the max block size can be a fair bit bigger without causing any significant harm to the bitcoin's properties. That doesn't mean I think a 1GB limit is a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:07:44
You fundamentally do not understand how bitcoin works. I recommend the great A. Antonopoulos' book.

There are people at Blockstream that do understand Bitcoin inside out. But Adam Back isn't one of them. And proof-of-work was invented by others, years before he came across it.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:49:54
Preventing most of the people on this planet from using bitcoin so that 'hodlers' can run their node on a 12 year old laptop does not make you the good guys. 
A lot of people (like the OpenBazaar team) know there is no future for their applications/businesses with 5-10 dollar fees. They literally have no choice here.

You mean the last one, surely?

Without the support of end users and developers, the fork will have no (or little) value. Then it will be something that is not relevant, let alone a threat.

Yeah, fuck off 'business' with you customers and your 'money'.
Bitcoin doesn't belong to the people with all the bitcoins and all the hashpower, it belongs to us, the great people of r/bitcoin who download all of the blocks but never make any IMMORAL transactions!

B2X doesn't abandon a 'full block policy', it simply changes the limit from 1 MB to 2 MB. Blocks would be full again very quickly.

Lightning does very little for privacy in the cryptographic sense. Of course, not every transaction will be stored in the global ledger (although every open channel will be, and so all relationships will be visible) but transactions are visible to all nodes along the route. In this way it is only as 'private' as using a credit card - your transactions are not visible to literally EVERYONE, but easily visible to anyone with access to intermediaries (like the authorities). 
So cypherpunk.

Running a node is pointless unless you are using the confidence given by full validation to make economic decisions. Depending on you internet connection you may even slow down the network.

Not sure I like the tone of your reply, but yes you're absolutely right. 
I have, however, written and published over 50 papers in the area of computational and theoretical physics, and have an h-index in the high 20s. Many of these papers involved collaboration with experimentalists in a wide variety of disciplines, and not everyone is prepared to use/learn Latex just to contribute to a document. 
Personally, I try to use Latex whenever I can (including my own PhD thesis) because it is so much better, but it makes it difficult to share documents with people who only know how to use MSWord. I guess if you've never worked with anyone outside your own department it might seem as if the whole world does the same thing as you.

Nothing. HODLing as a philosophy is about sitting on ones arse and getting rich off of the work of others. If someone truely believes in the transformative potential of this technology, they would be contributing to it's growth by using (and transacting) with Bitcoin every single day.
