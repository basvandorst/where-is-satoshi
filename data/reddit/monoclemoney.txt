TL;DR: Garbage in. Garbage out. 
People don’t have to be assholes about it, true. 
From another perspective, Bitcoin is still new enough that it is extremely risky by traditional standards. 
*The amount of research you do on everything around Bitcoin is directly correlated to how safe your bits are if you do decide to purchase some.*
If you want to Bitcoin, learn to google and use the search on this sub. Treat it like Yahoo! Answers and expect the same quality of responses and trolling. 
That’s what those “assholes” did, and they most likely want you to understand what you’re doing so we don’t have to read your “I gave all my bitcoins to a hooker accidentally and they won’t give it back” and “I lost my phone and my Bitcoin. HALP!” posts down the road. 
Call it tough love. Call it hazing. Call it “why should I expect anyone to condense hours and hours of experience over years into a tidy nugget for me when the only effort I’ve put forth is a throwaway account and a single post asking ‘how do I bit coins’?” 
If you want someone to coddle you and walk you through step by step so you can blame them when it goes wrong, go buy GBTC OTC shares on your ScottTrade account or wait for an ETF. 
You get what you put in it ...and with Bitcoin much more profit than price alone.

It is a feature. Don’t brand on a feature. What does the feature bring to the platform? 
Just from what you posted, the value isn’t in your Nuclear Dump™️ feature. 
It sounds like a crypto exchange command center or an exchange hub. It sounds like the value is access and control at multiple exchanges from a single interface, saves on possible fees from ferrying bits between wallets, and most importantly the ability to take advantage of price swings on various exchanges without having to waste time moving around funds.

I've used Hive and Airbitz. Airbitz is a great concept that needs refined. It's clunky at best. Hive was acceptable - unless you have to enter your pass phrase when trying to make a transaction. Not for sure, but I only think you have to enter the pass phrase after a restart.

OP is a tree in a potential forest. 
Microsoft has already done the hard part - they have millions of people that trust them with many types of fiat across a multitude of demographics (B2C &amp; B2B: Xbox, Skype, Azure, Office, MSDN,  etc.) They have an infrastructure that accepts payments from consumers, partners, vendors, and suppliers. 
Depending on how deeply Microsoft (MS) integrates bitcoin, it could open up bits to millions of people (and businesses) that would not have taken the steps to mine or use LocalBitcoins, Coinbase, Bitpay, an exchange, or any of the other perceived and real hoops it takes to go from fiat to bitcoin as of now. 
Other potential uses: 
- MS accepts bits for AP and pays those that accept for AR. 
- Integrating bitcoin with their ERP Dynamics Accounting might allow anyone to do AR/AP with bits.
And they could do it all in the background with enough in the bank to hedge against volatility.

I'd think the most relevant way to introduce it to accounting students is to start with the ledger. Debits and credits. Instead of a third party like a bank being the final say on who's account has what, Bitcoin uses a network of ledgers that reconcile. 
Then, you can get into how these ledgers use mining and cryptography to incentivize people to verify transactions, keep live copies of the ledger (nodes), and make sure everyone is telling the same story (blockchain). 
There might be some auditing lessons in there as well - how anyone can verify a transaction made on the blockchain and trace the movement to some degree. 
After they learn some basics, you might ask them their thoughts on if it should be classified as a currency, a commodity, or some other instrument. There are plenty examples around the world and the reasoning behind it. 
There's a great thread on here that links to a Google Doc of Bitcoin related academic papers that might be a good springboard for ideas, too.

Clearly you didn’t listen. It’s incredibly relevant. They used bitcoin as an example of why people should “get in early” on OneCoin. The guy that got many investors to realize OneCoin was a scam is a bitcoin evangelist ...and he didn’t want crap like this to tarnish the reputation of actual crypto.

Or let’s evangelize overly complicated mechanisms that piss people off and turn them off to BTC. If your friend wants to accept BTC and keep it as BTC, that’s great. But even your example has him cashing out for fiat every so often will incur transaction fees. Let’s see how quick he calls to thank you when the market drops 20% right before he goes to cash out.
Long and short of it is you clearly don’t run a business and you have no experience in corporate finance or taxation. BTC has a great future, but your barber isn’t the killer app. And you’re just going to turn him off and everyone he tells about the jackass trying to get him to accept internet money. 
You haven’t thought this through and should spend that enthusiasm on something to support the community ...not piss off the guy that cuts your hair. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:24:06
Based on these responses, there are two options for BTC. One is the QR code which has downsides. The other is a service of some type that’ll take 1-2% that mitigates most of the QR code downsides. 
This person is a barber. He makes money being a barber. Does he forge his own shears? Did he build the building where he works? Does he fashion his chairs from steel and leather? No. It’s a cost of doing business. Just like 1-2% for not having to whittle his own qr codes, and remember to switch them out, and protect them from being replaced with not his QR code. 
Based on all the “you just have to do these thirty steps,” I’m going to go ahead and say your friend isn’t going to use crypto.
And while you may save 1-2% transaction fees implementing a Rube Goldberg contraption to take crypto, you’ve opened up an entire new set of concerns for your friend at tax time. 
IMO, your friend should just raise his prices 5-10% and keep taking credit cards. This whole thing sounds like a knee jerk reaction when your friend saw how much he was paying in fees without thinking about the costs and logistics to replace that system.

I’d double check that tax liability thing you have in your head. Let’s say BTC is 10k on Monday when I get my haircut and pay in BTC. Your friend exchanges for fiat on Friday and BTC is 12k. Your friend now owes income tax on the amount I paid him Monday, and short term capital gains on the profit of the exchange for fiat minus any fees. 
It’s a layer of complexity that most small business owners don’t want to deal with. It’s cumbersome, and your friend sounds like he is trying to simplify that part of his business. 
I still think you should pitch it as a savings mechanism if you do at all. Accept BTC and hodl for at least a year so he is paying long term capital gains. He’ll still have to pay income tax on the BTC he accepted for services, but he won’t have to deal with the complexities that arise from accounting for profit/loss for each exchange from BTC to fiat. 
And while I’m not in the banking business, I’m also not an accountant or tax attorney. Neither are you. The best advice you can give him is to talk to someone that is before he goes down this path. I’m not saying don’t pitch it, I’m just saying don’t gloss over the complexities that come with accepting and exchanging for fiat in a service business. 
You might also search this sub for similar threads about small businesses starting to accept BTC, why some stopped accepting BTC, and everything in between over the past few years. You’re not the first person on here to have this idea for their barber, butcher, or candle stick maker to start accepting BTC. It worked out great for some and not so great for others. Digging into those might give you a more thorough picture and in turn help you be a better advocate for your friend to learn more for himself.

Arbitrage on this volatility between exchanges is probably not going to happen if you are just now thinking of it. You can start setting up accounts and seeding funds, but my guess is it'll take longer than you think.
