What "tech" exactly? Blockchain? Anybody can use that to make their own currency. 
This is my rant on bitcoin and please help me understand 
Bitcoin works so well because it’s powered by greed. 
People see bitcoin price rise so they buy bitcoin, 
Which causes the price to rise again and more people notice and buy bitcoin etc...... it's a damn loop. 
Other bubbles where caused by profit lost, but how will this pop if the backing is the people with an "easy money mind" who just want to see it rise? 
It's not backed by anything. So besides the "technology" and the high percentage, what are the actual reason why someone would purchase bitcoin?

That's the interesting thing about bitcoin. As long as there is greed the bubble won't burst. All the other bubbles burst because the investors realize they where making sh*t money and losing money.  However, the profit that people make with bitcoin is from other people buying it. It's a loop and as long as the loop continues, the price will go up. 
People see bitcoin go up so they buy bitcoin.  The buying of bitcoin makes the price goes up again (previous investors see they are making money) and so other people invest in bitcoin because they also see the price go up... it's a damn loop. 
Bitcoin is also not backed by anything, just the get rich quick people. The technology behind Bitcoin has been seen in other currency so it's not something unique. The price of bitcoin is high not because people regularly using it day to day but because of the buy and sell. 
 so yea... it's a bubble that will burst by greed pretty much.
