They can't continue saying they need more time forever. I think a lot of people won't learn from this if withdrawals are enabled soon and will stay with mtgox anyhow.

Yeah, none of these people wanted to remove mtgox when it was $200+ over the other exchanges

I've had the same bad experiences with verification on coinbase. I've probably tried 15 times in the past 2 months and it never works. They told me there are correct answers to each question but I think they just have the wrong information or something.

People are realizing we are just in a leveraged credit bubble, and because of it we're going to the 400s and possibly lower. If you have open leveraged long positions you better close them now or else you will get a margin call soon.

Mining is what gives bitcoin a solid price. Millions of dollars of energy are spent each day mining bitcoins. The miners get bitcoin in return along with transaction fees and can sell them on an exchange for some sort profit usually; if the difficulty increases too much faster than the price of bitcoin on an exchange, some miners that have lower profit margins due to the equipment they are using will find it unprofitable to sell the bitcoin immediately and may have to stop mining completely. So basically mining controls the supply of bitcoins. The demand exists largely due to speculation but also because a lot of people want bitcoins to use them for money transfer.

No one is going to use your exchange until you decrease the fees to at most .2%, or you have a ton more volume so that buying the 0 fees for $100/month is actually worth it.

Thats part of it, but the other reason is because someone with a lot of coins has been dumping them at a rate of more than 1000 per hour on mtgox. This person could have stolen the btc or been an early adopter, but if these coins actually exist on mtgox and are eventually withdrawn by people the price will go down everywhere else slowly as people send coins from mtgox to other exchanges to sell for a lot of profit.
