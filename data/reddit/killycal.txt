Yes. I don’t understand how it’s superior to bitcoin in every way like says

Is this satire? I can’t tell

Why? Why is ethereum so good?

Coincidentally, librarians are almost always libertarians.

A little bit more about this, I am a writer and am working on an article about what is most important, troubling and need-to-know for traders and investors in the ecosystem. I am hoping that this survey will be able to shed some light on those questions and also hope it will be a bit of fun for everyone to see the results.  
Thanks for taking 20 seconds out of your day to contribute guys and gals.

Uh...what am I looking at?

I think at this point btc has definitely solidified itself as the mother currency

See, that’s what everyone told me when I put my life savings into bitcoin while it was at 600. Really glad I ignored them all

After the fork I’m certain it will drop a little. I doubt it’ll be much.

The 24/hr volume of bitfinex is about 49k coins, which is about 343 million. It wouldn’t need to be that much of a discount over several weeks for bitfinex to be able to handle a transaction that large.

You can go off of market predictions but let’s be honest, bitcoin is a new thing and doesn’t follow the normal investing rules that you’d find in corporate stock.
I made the decision to invest in bitcoin because I looked into the technology and then did the math and knew that there was no way it wasn’t much higher in the future than it was when I bought.
That may seem like blind luck, but I knew the whole time.

Of course it wouldn’t work like a normal transaction, but when you’re talking that much money, someone’s gonna be interested. At that point you’d be communicating with an exchange directly.

She could if she could get an exchange to buy them all. One of them might be willing to invest that much if she sold at a discount.
When you’re dealing with that much money, the normal rules don’t apply.
