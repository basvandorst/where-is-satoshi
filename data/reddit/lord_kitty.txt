I don't care, that's about what is usually tipped in the Dogecoin sub. It doesn't matter there because you'll end up giving out and collecting a lot of tips anyway.
Even giveaways giving 10 doges to everyone is welcome because we care about the action, not the value. It's on the internet. You have absolutely no reason to give someone even a fraction of a dollar other than out of good will or generosity.
Oh, and I see you never tipped anyone here. Don't come preaching here about tipping. You're the first one that spitting on a tip. No one, not matter the amount said things like that, whenever for Bitcoins or Dogecoins.

Yeah, I tip one guy, that I didn't even notice it reached the top of the thread, and I'm accused of promoting it. Its not like Dogecoin needs this kind of promotion anyway. Everyone here probably already knows what it is. Maybe if you thought about it, you know, with your head, you would have figured that out.
No wonder everyone think that this sub is full of jackasses. If you have a problem with me tipping Doges, then tough luck. Its not like I'll stop tipping either Bitcoins or Dogecoins here.

I've heard tales of people like you in this sub. Now I finally meet one.
I had no idea people cared how much I tip. What if someone doesn't have much money? What if someone doesn't have much left in his tipping wallet and just wanted to make a clever reply? Does it matter how much the tip is worth? Isn't tipping about the gesture?
