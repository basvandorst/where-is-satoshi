Funny you posted this. I've been stacking for years and have lost out on a lot of money in cryptos.  Today no more.  Gold is heavily manipulated, I will no longer be subjected!  GOLD---&gt;BTC

They buy a ton of them up and then dump them all at once to crash the markets up front for a small profit to come back and buy them all back when everyone panic sells on the way down and then they drive it up and wait for amaeture investors to join and do it again.

Well theoretically it should oscillate around $2200 mark IMO, and then if it exploded $800 again likely, there you go $3,000.

It will come back up and probably break $3,000 USD the next boom cycle.

I have a feeling the institutions with deep pockets are in the game now, and are going to crash the markets buy In cheap and then make it explode again.  They are a bunch of theifs.
