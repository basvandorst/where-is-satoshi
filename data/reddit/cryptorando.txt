Ally, Revolut, Wells Fargo (for now). There is a start!
Edit. These are good banks! Also, credit unions are swell as well!
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:32:46
Yeah it's disgusting. It's so easy to implement segwit, and their lack of doing so speaks their intentioms. At this point, coinbase is nothing but a disgraced btrash power grab.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:40:53
Lmao that is an interesting business model.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:36:26
Lol fake news is real.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:10:22
Makes sense. Coinbase is btrash territory.

@_date: 2018-01-12 15:29:25
It takes zero effort to implement segwit. This is unacceptable.

Yes I have WF as well. So far so good, but I cant help but have this feeling that they won't be compliant forever (this is not based on fact or reality). I am about to open an Ally account until Revolut is available to the US To deal with my paranoia haha.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:05:47
This. It is a monopoly on instant deposits in the US. I can't wait for a new exchange to pop up that offers it.

@_date: 2018-01-30 04:15:02
Yes you need segwit for LN.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:37:33
Lol why even defend them? Coinbase is the number one exchange for newbies. Even if I don't use their services all the newbies will. You are obviously btrash holder.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:05:15
Yep. People don't get that btc is here to stay.

Lol jk.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:23:34
Lol who isn't on segwit yet? It's just exchanges right?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:10:28
There is already a coin tied to gold. It's called Digix (DGD)
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:48:05
Ethereum then.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:58:32
That polishing a turd isn't what will keep bitcoin relevant in the long run. I am talking about legitimate use case for bitcoin either than processing payments. B2x didn't go through because of the communities consensus mechanism, and politics is all about consensus and application, and I am just drawing correlations and providing food for thought. If you want to be a jackass then that's your prerogative. But you can fuck right off with that shit.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:38:32
Lol this is so great. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:41:17
Username checks out.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:43:11
It's more like, there is a subset of every population that has completely had it with the current financial system, and it makes a large enough subset of investors to give the coin value. The very reason why b2x wasn't implemented is what gives bitcoin strength. Decentralized consensus is hard to achieve, the only problem now is implementing it. Hopefully the idea of idea of negative transaction fees will incentive adoption before btc drops to 3k.
If only this subset would but their efforts into forming better methods of consensus and incentiving implementation instead of screaming HODL we could speed this process along.

Coinbase has segwit enabled, and a big part of the fees last time was from coinbase clogging the mempool. So there's that.

Wrong usage of the GIF.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:59:00
Not yet. But it being a good storage of wealth has an application. People who buy gold to put under their bed aren't actually planning on buying goods and services with it (unless their economy goes to shit). Also, btc has recently been used as a prominent method of transferring wealth over international borders. There are other cryptocurrencies for the purchase of goods and services.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:19:12
Blockchain has the potential to create a new political system. Imagine a DAO that acts as a campaign finance mechanism. The possibilities are endless.

@_date: 2017-11-28 04:34:27
What a fuckboi.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:25:25
If you replace the bitcoin with the word blockchain, then the meme is accurate. Bitcoin decentralizes wealth management, but not to the effect of changing the political landscape. Blockchain technology does, however, have the potential to change politics as we know it.

Lol this needs to be top comment.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:09:05
Yes there is nothing wrong with a central authority. It only matters when all the economies of all the world's are dominated by central authorities who have no accountability for their actions. And in that sense there will always be value on both sides of the aisle.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:29:47

Can you provide a source for this? Or give discussion? I thought Simplicity was Turing Incomplete while Solidity is Turing Complete. To say I completely understand those terms would be false, but one does sound superior to the other.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:16:39
Yes but the tech obviously worked because it proliferated in the Dark net, yes there are many degrees of failure to it, but those who got back on the horse after mtgox are doing well now. I just don't think your comparison to lotto numbers is accurate or in good taste.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:31:33
I wonder how he is doing.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:37:37
True. But I think there is a way out of this instead of excepting the harsh reality of the complex as the norm. And the viewpoint of "everything is good in moderation" is IMO a slippery slope to killing yourself. There is way out. But without a good support system it is very well impossible.

I am convinced that nobody should invest a large sum until they experience the market for two months with a small holding. Nothing can prepare you except for getting your feet wet. And it boggles the mind how people can invest more than they can afford. It all boils down to Greed.

I think it's too late at this point.
