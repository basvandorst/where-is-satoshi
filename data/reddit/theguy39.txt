I called them yesterday took less then 4 minuted to get somone on the phone, due to high volume of trading and the fact they dont keep over 90% of there money in hot wallet where it can be hacked if it came to that resulted in them waiting for bitcoins to transfer from there cold storage wallets. Or so they said, this happened last year also I have been with them for over a year and they have never let me down. You can still withdraw your money or whatever they just dont have the physical coins online yet since there was 3x higher volume over the weekend then all year!

I called them yesterday took less then 4 minuted to get someone on the phone, due to high volume of trading and the fact they don't there money in the hot wallet (online) where it can be hacked, resulted in them waiting for bitcoins to transfer from there cold storage wallets which would physically have to be done, Duh whole point of cold storage Hack proof!
     This happened last year also around the 9-1100$ crazy volume time, I have been with them for over a year and they have never let me down. You can still withdraw your money or whatever they just dont have the physical coins online yet since there was 3x higher volume over the weekend then all year!  They are legit and everything they do is to be within the Canadian law, like having dormant account fees after 6 months same as a bank this isn't Cavirtex's own rule all banks have them to they are simply making sure there within the law incase it comes to it,  Lol I trust my own country with my money and glad I didn't goto mt.gox last time everyone thought cavirtex was bad hahaha!  Are you guys all kids or just dumb!?  Trollolol-on bitches!
