 tl;dr: CryptoSlate went undercover to try and open accounts at four of the largest U.S. banks, telling them ahead of time that we would use the account to buy [Bitcoin]( and cryptocurrency on [Coinbase]( The verdict is in—personal accounts are at risk of being closed, and accounts for crypto-related businesses are outright prohibited.
Solution: open an account at a credit unions and then transfer funds to a mainstream bank, if needed.

People are attempting to buy USDT with "USD" for withdrawals. USD is even more illiquid than USDT on Bitfinex. Users can then send these Tethers to other exchanges to trade for bitcoin or other coins (likely at a discount on Tether).

TL;DR  
1. Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright are using 'no true Scotsman' rhetoric towards Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
2. All other versions of Bitcoin are "inaccurately" using the Bitcoin name, says Ayre.
3. Ayre claims that large block sizes and on-chain scaling can solve Bitcoin's woes and liberate it from "dictatorial protocol developer teams."
4. The crux of the debate is the block size issue, with BTC 2 MB -&gt; BCH 32 MB -&gt; BSV 128 MB.
5. Large block sizes are unlikely to change transaction throughput (at least at the moment), as historical data indicates that blocks seldom go above 2 MB in size.

In bitcoin, users have no balances unlike XRP/Ethereum, only UTXOs that they control. If a user wants to transfer bitcoin to someone else, their wallet selects one or more UTXOs as inputs that need to total the amount they want to transfer.   
The desired amount then goes back to the recipient, which is called the output, and the difference goes back to the sender, which is the change output.
  
A batch transaction is one with three or more outputs. Meanwhile, a normal unbatched transaction will have one transactional output and one change output. A typical batched transaction will have dozens if not hundreds of outputs. These additional outputs are not tabulated in the total transaction charts most people see.
Thus, to calculate the 'real' number of transactions, the simple calculation is to take the total number of outputs minus the total number of change outputs.

This does not include second-layer transactions nor does it account for the increase in transaction batching following 2017. The total number of transactions (by # of recipients) is likely much higher today.

If you can't tell, the whole thing is satire. Vernacular included.
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:22:38
Incorrect, a single change output can correspond to multiple outputs.   
For a more accurate depiction of 'real transactions,' it's necessary to look at payments per day, which is total outputs minus change outputs. Example chart:

Link to a more in-depth story surrounding OpenNode's rejection of Roger Ver's $1.25 offer to build on BCH.  
1. Roger Ver lambastes Bitcoin over YouTube, claiming that it will take over 100 years to scale lightning network to 10 billion people.
2. Ver doesn't want to be on the tail-end of Tim Draper's investment in OpenNode, so he offers a "no-strings-attached" $1.25 million investment to OpenNodes to develop on BCH as well as BTC.
3. OpenNodes declines because the company believes that Bitcoin is more secure and more tested, consequently limiting the risk for its users.

TL;DR  
1. Transactions at 6-month high at 310,000 per day.
2. Fees at multi-year lows, both in USD and BTC terms: $0.031 / 3 sats.
3. Bitcoin could be stimulating economic participation in unstable countries such as Iraq and Venezuela.
4. Paying in bitcoin is better than paying in credit card; but fees for BTC to fiat are still too high (2%+)

Summary for the busy: SegWit + transaction batching + Lightning Network mean more economic activity can take place on the Bitcoin network at a lower cost. Other factors not mentioned in the article include wallets getting better at estimating optimal fees, meaning fewer people are overpaying.
The trend will likely continue as innovation progresses.

Trading your Bitcoin for gold bars on localbitcoins is a good option I've heard. /s

Possibly a combination of transaction batching among exchanges and SegWit adoption.
