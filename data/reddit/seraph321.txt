This certainly seems more secure. I currently use authy, and I have to admit, the thing I always worry about is what happens if I lose the hardware and need access? I have already had one time when I was out of the country, so my sim didn't work to receive SMS (stupid employee plan), and my phone broke so I lost my authy install. I couldn't restore authy without SMS,and I was kinda screwed. Now I carry a second (very encrypted) device with authy setup already for this situation. Any thoughts on how you deal with a lost/broken u2f device?

Yeah, not a surprise to me. The vast majority of (the already small number of savvy investors interested in bitcoin) people with that kind of liquid cash available weren't wanting to put so much into such a high risk asset. This is bitcoin a couple years ago, we're talking about here.

Look, I agree, but yes I'd heard of the tulip bubble. It's legendary and was long before crypto. It's taught to everyone learning economics, but I've never even taken an economics class and I'd heard of it. It's not exactly obscure.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:34:50
Yeah, you can do that, but then you're paying for a safe deposit box in a particular location/country. And you've had to introduce the banking system to it. Certainly not the worst option though.

Going to Buenos Aires this year and plan to bring bitcoin, so I'm looking for exactly this kind of place. Very cool. 
p.s. It's possible to have not heard of reddit but be so into Bitcoin you start a business named after it? Holy shit.

Yeah, this is a nightmare I've worried about. How to generate a password you can be reasonably sure you could reconstruct if forgotten, but has no ties to you otherwise. It's quite the challenge. I don't believe in writing down my password in any form, but clues are acceptable if done well.

Right, I certainly don't live paycheck to paycheck, but I don't expect to owe any US taxes after deducting what I've paid to my host country. I don't see why reporting what I've saved/invested would change anything.

It was the cellar door at Palmara Vineyard in Richmond. Talked to the owner and programmer of the C64. He's trying to sell his house, actually, but not sure if it comes with the tech. :)

I'm following 186 accounts currently. 
By 'dominating', I mean that when I would start starting scrolling through my feed (I typically look once a day or so), I would see Coindesk about 2-3x more than any other account. And every time I see a duplicate tweet, I need to read the first few words to know it's a duplicate. This just wastes time.

Yep, it was dominating my feed. You don't repeat content on Twitter.

Those are fine things to be upset about, but don't seem new to FATCA. And there's still nothing wrong with having foreign accounts, it's just hiding income that's a problem.
@_date: 2014-01-06 02:00:40
This will be my first year filing as a foreign resident, so FATCA is certainly interesting to me, but so far I fail to understand 1. Why normal people (read: previously compliant without overly complex finances) are so upset about it. 2. Why bitcoin would help.
I already knew I'd need to disclose my foreign assets, and it looks like I don't even need to do *that* under FATCA unless they are over $[200k]( The issue of whether this is a privacy violation aside, it doesn't appear to increase my tax burden or even be that complicated (it's just another form that looks like it will take my accountant an extra hour at most). 
For whom is this 'making lives miserable' and costing '$1000s of fees'? Is that more for people who own businesses and make money by more unconventional means than a salary?
I'm a big bitcoin fan, but I can't see why I'd be driven to start hiding my assets because of this. (which wouldn't help if you want to stay compliant anyway)

I think it's more likely that it's being stored and processed, somewhere along the way, by ancient mainframe programs that have limits too expensive to change.

This is a long thread, and I can't claim to have read it all, but do you give any consideration to how much more it costs to treat emergencies vs. using preventative care to avoid many of those emergencies? It's a huge difference. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:09:02
As long as we're doing this refrain - you can still put the same money in now that you would have then. It still has the same, or probably better, chance of really taking off. $56billion is nothing compared to what it will be worth if it truly takes hold, even as just an asset class similar to precious metals used as a store or value or hedge against the broader market. That happens, and we'll see 10-100x from here easy, maybe 1000x. 
Still high risk and only invest what you can lose.

Man, I'm an American living in Australia, and your comments are quite amusing, yet sad, to me. There is very little difference day to day here, but where our governments differ, I have to admit, it's almost 100% for the better here. I even have a high income, which means I get taxed hard. My healthcare is MORE expensive here than in the US, but I can easily see how it's benefitting everyone around me. I talk to my dad at home, who is under constant stress due to medical bills, while he's trying to recover, and I realize what I'm paying for is worth it.

I'll just echo what others have said because it's good advice, you should rebalance your portfolio. It doesn't matter what you're invested in, you don't want too big a concentration in one asset class, much less, a single asset. Add to that that bitcoin is, even by serious crypto fans, still more speculation than it is a stable investment.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:51:51
Wow, that's super interesting. I don't know how I had never heard that before.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:14:18
Well, obviously you could try, and maybe it would work, though you have to weigh that against the risk of prison. Not reporting due to negligence or ignorance is one thing, fraud is another. That's why even taking about this, unless you're using an anonymous account via tor, means you should probably deal with it soon. Not because they'd find you because of these posts, but that they might be found as part of an investigation later. 
As a thought experiment, you'd need to think you're smarter than people who have been trained for years to spot fraud. And then, if they suspect, they can audit your bank accounts and make you prove the origin of any deposits that don't line up. And you'd need to account for purchases.
Btw, there's such a think as claim gambling losses too. I just have no experience with that side of tax law.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:20:17
Pretty cool way to think about it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:33:33
I don't know how bulletproof it is, but sure, I think it's probably a common tactic. It's likely one of the many reasons the US government tightly controls what gambling is legal, and how approved gambling businesses report transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:43:11
Let's just say, OP has the right idea. I would do the same. And it's not like "not having an issue" is any indication. They will go back decades to look for things if they finally notice or audit.
For your winnings, the right thing to do now is talk to an accountant and probably claim it on your next tax return. The longer you wait, the more they can charge for penalties. But if you bring it to them as an honest mistake, they probably just want what you'd have originally owed.

When/if you're so certain about bitcoin always going up, you would logically convert all your fiat to btc, and then you would have to spend btc to buy anything.

Ok, cool, so I could buy a second trezor and just have it ready to restore to.

Do you really think any of these businesses can survive without the internet anymore? I don't care how much they 'control' things, that's the equivalent of saying they'll shut down the power grid and go back to using their own generators.

I don't know about you, but I tend to focus on parties and conversations that aren't full of dumb people. I've had many of those wander towards the topic of bitcoin and I'm always happy to help inform. If I started out every conversation thinking the other person is a dumb bag of dicks... Well, I would have missed out on a lot.

It's always interesting and often inspiring to hear stories like this and I don't question your decisions for a moment. Your gains significantly impacted your life, and that's what matters most.
I very rarely post, but I've been here for a long time.  I bought in mostly around $100 and we still have not reached a level that represents a fundamental shift in my life, but I don't say that to brag, only to show there is plenty left to hodl and a huge range of impact this recent rise has had.
I am in for the moon, but I'm super excited to see people improve their life along the way. When the time comes that I feel i can pull profits that set me up for life, I may, but of course I'll always keep one foot in.
Good luck and enjoy.

I would also really like their contact info. I'm heading to Argentina this year and want to use bitcoin if possible, but worry about finding trustworthy brokers.
@_date: 2017-05-03 05:13:28
Yeah, saying everyone should have a certain number is less useful than just recommending people have a percentage of their savings or net worth in it. BTC is basically a new asset class, but one that may end up going up by 100-10000x in value from here. Putting in $10 now could still be life-changing.

You're comparing exchange prices to street prices. Totally different things. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:57:43
I go back and forth on whether bitcoin is truly anti-fragile. I think you're right in saying there are a lot of geo-political events that would strengthen its value, but I also see it as being very vulnerable to a host of other potential downfalls. The current state of the network is very precarious (hitting blocksize limits), and the community is failing to prove its theoretical ability to adapt.
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:24:39
So flammable! 
@_date: 2017-05-03 05:01:24
If that happened, there would be a hard-fork almost immediately, possibly including a rollback or invalidation of specific transactions, if necessary. That's what ethereum did (albeit, to a slightly less drastic situation), and it amazingly survived. 
There are too many people with too much to lose to let it fall to zero without a consensus. The community would move to the new chain long before it lost all value. Then, the question would be whether it could gain back people's faith, but there would be plenty of people willing to buy in at various levels.
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:26:27
Haha... Glad I only keep a little on my phone. Wait.. How much is it actually? Oh... Wow. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:47:07
Exactly. There is no good excuse, imo, to NOT have a position in bitcoin at this point. Doesn't need to be large, and certainly shouldn't be anything you aren't willing to lose. 
If bitcoin is going to truly take off (whether as a widely used currency, or just a store of value similar to gold), we are still in the early stages, and it would need to go up 100-1000x from here.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:57:45
Not sure why nobody has said this, but please feel free to take some profits if it will impact your life, but don't feel like it's all or nothing. Rebalancing your investments is a wise thing, it's not a declaration of lost faith.
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:38:41
It would need to increase a lot for it to be USEFUL to those billion people. It doesn't help them much of they all hold a few bits but they're not worth enough to buy bread. If bitcoin becomes even a temporary store of wealth for that many people, 1 btc will need to be worth a lot.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:47:18
Well there's no point in taking profit if you're more bullish than ever. Not selling is equivalent to increasing your position in terms of portfolio percentage, without having to actually buy. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:16:36
Yes, he was. You appear to have been responding to someone saying it would be easy to hack you, which he wasn't. He said if someone did that, it would likely fit the technical definition of hacking, assuming it involved bypassing some technical security. The fact that you have preventive measures in place that may make that impossible doesn't change what it's called when it happens. You listing all your unnecessary details about an alarm and shotgun is just weird and irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:58:04
Yes, almost universally. It's primarily a supply/demand thing (more competition between sellers on an exchange), but you're also paying a premium for the lower barrier to entry on the street. There, transactions can be anonymous and there is less scrutiny of fund sources. This generally applies to fiat currency as well.
