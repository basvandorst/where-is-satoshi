"they" listen to yourself, you sound like a "1mb is all we'll ever need" guy xD
@_date: 2016-06-07 22:18:19
aren't the blocks already compact? 
Remember these?

I'm serious, you consider this post spam like you do my transaction?
@_date: 2016-06-07 02:36:02
all of have one unified position?  You might be stereotyping a little lol

If you're talking about Fred Ehrsam's medium post, that was his personal blog post:
The other co-founder, Brian Armstrongmade also blogpost, though I believe the only critical thing he had to say about bitcoin was not about the digital system itself, but about it's core devs and their lack of ability to sold the scaling issue (with 2mb hf or releasing segwit).
Coinbase blog only states they added Etherium, there is no bitcoin bashing found:

"while they sold at $400..." 
Why are you assuming they sold?  Pretty sure they are that upset because they are heavily invested in it still.

I actually dumped 350 btc and to be honest there are many others of us.  I think there was enough of us to stall the growth of bitcoin and actually think some whales are slowly dumping as the price increases (hence the stagnant / least volatile price ever of btc).  
If you go over to r/btc you'll see a different view, similar to mine, of the path btc needs to take to become the true global currency.  Most on have a heavy investment in btc, and their patience is wearing very thin.

Bitcoin: You can settle on things within 10 minutes to 2 hours.

Where is it on the roadmap? 
@_date: 2016-05-31 11:42:51
curious to see now that out the blocks are all 99% full, what a huge surge of buying will do.  I guess my big fear is this will impact me directly when I pay my friends back for lunch etc.  If it costs me 20 cents to do so, I'll just pay cash or find another digital solution.
@_date: 2016-05-23 01:18:31
I'm not trying to bum anyone out or move any markets, I'm actually hoping for a scaling resolution as fast as possible.  Once segwit gets implements and isn't enough of a solution, and LN doesn't help in time, I think a HF increase should be considered.  I'm just saying why not leave this option on the table?
@_date: 2016-05-22 18:09:17
interesting, thanks for sharing this.  At what point do we get to a "no return" level of unconfirmed TXs?
@_date: 2016-05-22 16:16:21
happy taco Tuesday! All is fine and well here!

I think they decided to open up the door to ETH trading while still believing in BTC long term.  ETH is getting huge trade volume and LISK now too lately.

dat miner fee...not sure you want to buy anything less than $5 with btc settlements monies until we get seqwit or something.
@_date: 2016-05-24 03:24:51
if it is, it's not an option being seriously considered, or at least not on the roadmap, unless I'm missing something?
@_date: 2016-05-31 11:39:13
don't both go hand in hand? Like value of bitcoin goes up as buyers increase, or is there some way everyone is keeping these tx off chain, aka dark so to speak?
@_date: 2016-05-31 11:41:10
what's the orphaning risk?
@_date: 2016-05-24 11:52:49
Obviously things can change, including people's opinions.  Curious to see if core can adapt here.
Where is it on the roadmap?  I honestly don't know where it is.  I've heard of it but never seen it.
@_date: 2016-05-20 03:38:43
things will get ugly fast, we were seeing a need for a 2mb upgrade in late 2015.
@_date: 2016-05-31 11:40:25
I guess that's my quesion, do we have an example of this happening the last halving?  Like, when tx bottleneck happened, what happened to the tx fees? Stay the same in terms of USD or same in BTC?
@_date: 2016-05-22 20:54:58
trust me I do, I'd pay attention if I were you, especially since your livelihood depends on btc value staying the same or increasing, not the other way around.
@_date: 2016-05-23 01:24:37
you won't be when thousands of transactions never get confirmed, and the system essentially fails to function effectively, due to its new settlements roadmap
@_date: 2016-05-25 03:03:51
Where do you see that?  They are one of the top exchanges, seems more so of a FOMO thing more than anything.
@_date: 2016-05-23 01:14:20
I can not do so, I must forever leave. This is my goodbye.
All joking aside, I've done really well, about doubled so I'm not losing anything here.  If it rises it'll only sustain the price change if the system can continue to scale with the growing usage. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:59:09
how much were the miner fees if you don't mind sharing?  
@_date: 2016-05-22 18:07:51
Lol, more like hundreds of btc but doesn't matter bc everything is amazing in the world of bitcoin!  So much innovation we will be using it for everything soon!  Oh wait, no we won't, we'll just use it for 7 settlements per second.
@_date: 2016-05-22 18:05:36
I've been following info on lightning and thunder.  Seems like a lot of noise (pun intended) and nothing else yet.
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:59:55
ah ok, supply and demand of what exactly?
