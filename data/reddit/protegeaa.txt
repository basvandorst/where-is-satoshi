I think somebody can buy a little cryptocurrency while they are paying off debt, but you should be making regular debt payments while you do it.

I'm really happy for you! But 2017 was insane and that is bad general advice for people...especially on the internet.
I've met too many people buying without understanding at this point. Very scary.

The bottom line is that currently it represents yet another way to transfer and hold wealth separately from governments.
Plenty of people will find that worthwhile.

Trust is super important, yes.

Sorry to hear that, and I hope you get them back.
On the flip side, Digix on Ethereum will give you toke s for your gold deposits, so you have the ability to trade independently of some 3rd party.
Gold on the blockchain does have uses, it will take some time to perfect it.

I don't think this is accurate anymore. A lot of big money is coming into BTC that has *zero* to do with ideology and everything to do with wanting to make more money.
This is not the glorious libertarian revolution. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:19:39
Nicely done!
I live in SoCal, so my "moon" number for crypto is when I can afford a home. SoCal housing prices have risen almost as fast as BTC...

Focusing in helping the poor and third world countries... THAT is how you sell bitcoin to people. Well done.
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:53:40


Except it has. Our standard of living in the West is amazing compared to even 50 years ago. Our discussion of those in the 3rd world countries reflects that we are insanely wealthy in historical terms. We're able to argue this  fact using computers that fit in our pockets.


I never said it would. Bitcoin is not a savior to the world. But it does make some people's lives better, and telling that story is going to get more people on board with it.

He's turned into a really good advertisement for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:56:00
Your points are appreciated-it is good to see opposing views and good reasons why I should be hesitant about bitcoin.
I'm new to it all and it's good to see a well reasoned critique.
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:29:34
Let me second that. It's a pain to have to look up my credit card site's info, because I am often stuck with a very slow (think 56k) internet connection. 
Even so, I also agree it is less unsettling to give Coinbase my credit card number than my bank account info. And 3% is reasonable.

I'm reading an article about him on Wired. Sounds like a real fighter with a long history of battling entrenched interests in Wall Street and thriving. If anyone actually has a "in case of death release all this damning info" type thing, it's him.

Coinbase is pretty good and a great first step into bitcoin. It has a nice looking website that makes bitcoin look like any other Silicon Valley tech, which is overall a good image for bitcoin. 
Depending on your reasons for buying bitcoin, you may want to keep your coins in a more secure wallet. I've installed Mycelium on my phone, which is a solid app and easy to use. I buy coins on Coinbase, then send the bulk of my coins to my Mycelium wallet, because I own the private keys on it, not a third party. Having Coinbase own the private keys is fine if you have little enough in your wallet you won't freak out if it got hacked. 
I wouldn't use Coinbase as an investing account or savings account, however.

The economy is not a zero sum game. The more productive people are everywhere, the better off the world is. 
Bitcoin helps people everywhere be more productive. That's a narrative you can tell people who have only heard it in reference to criminals.
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:42:52
Cool concept, but the game is extremely mundane. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:00:54
Imagine Hillary being asked about Bitcoin. Here are two possible answers:
1. There is a lot of concern over its use by criminals and for buying drugs. (Tough on crime stance)
2. I've heard some wonderful stories of people using it to help the less fortunate in poorer countries. (Care for poor stance)
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:07:51


Lots of people want to use it for many reasons not thought of when bitcoin was originally envisioned. Why limit free market solutions to making that possible?

I feel bad for BP. While a good deal of them don't understand the silliness of the question, some of them likely do, and yet still are obligated to ask.
You can imagine these poor guys trying to explain bitcoin to their disinterested supervisors...

The point made about Coinbase being easy to walk a new user through is one that is so often overlooked here. 
Coinbase and Circle are how you're going to bring the man on the street to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:26:18


This is deliciously ironic to read. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 13:26:40
Look at Coinbase.com. There's a site that signals, through its use of colors, font, and design, that it is a hip and trustworthy site to do business with. It says, "bitcoin is the next big thing coming out of Silicon Valley, and you should be a part of it". It's brilliant.
@_date: 2015-08-16 03:08:15
You will always have intermediaries when buying bitcoin, and trust is necessary for a monetary transaction of value to take place.
Keeping bitcoin to a small group of users that all fit the original idea is a great way for bitcoin to never be adopted beyond the fanboys. 
The more pure you want bitcoin to be, the less ubiquitous it will be. Period. If you want to stick to some original vision that you find pure, there are other crytpocurrencies that will fit the bill.
As an example, it took tens of millions using the crappy internet provided by AOL to really make the internet grow. AOL didn't ruin the internet; it got soccer moms on board.
I'd rather see soccer moms using bitcoin than some impossible "pure" vision used by a diminishing group of fanatics.

Still, it's mind bending.
@_date: 2016-09-17 22:57:50
Fascinating. I have wondered if anyone was doing this and if it was a feasible way to find bitcoin, as well as how soon CPU speeds might make it feasible.
It's likely I just don't understand large numbers well enough, though.

Unfortunately, it seems few people are interested in money management. The power of consumerism is too alluring and access to cheap credit too easy that most would prefer to be ignorant and satisfied with their latest iToy.
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:47:34
I wonder if you could make biltong with this as well.
@_date: 2015-09-30 17:20:37


Exactly. It's easy to forget that those outside our regular circles have vastly different focuses in their life, and knowing nothing about what bitcoin is doesn't mean they're stupid, but that they've not had a reason to learn about it.
But wow, watching those anchors and their cheesy lines, I wonder if they just hate themselves every day with the writing.
EDIT: Formatting

Haha, I'm not trying to get rich, just want to be able to better explain how incredibly large the pool of bitcoin addresses to people newer to it.
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:42:20
I read this on mobile, and the superscript didn't format...so I thought, 2256? Really?

Ignore price fluctuations.
Listen to podcasts of those tech leaders in Silicon Valley and hear how they talk about bitcoin.

Moved to Cali due to Navy, but glad to see MN getting some BTC love.
