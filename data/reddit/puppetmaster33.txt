using both methods make sense to me. you can use you HW wallet on any computer. Thats handy. On the other hand, in your PC is also has its benefits. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:16:54
makes sense. some tangible shit makes sense. if you have more than 20+ btc you are probably playing the game nicely already.

everybody is tryng to get rich fast. now, today. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:48:16
yes and no. us dollars have value because is legal tender in usa. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:28:37
i have an idea on how btc works. 
i just continue seeing this as an empty token.  nothing behind the symbol. Not gold, not shares, not even sand we are trading here. Just a frabricated math system. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:36:03
legal tender,  decided by government. enables you to buy sell services in the usa. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:24:30
i hope u r right. hope
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:46:56
that doesnt mean this is not a bubble. it can represent value. but maybe it should represent it better. this is insane.

youtube didnt make money for a decade. its starting to make money full of ads. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:26:19
this is not normal. thats my only point. everyone is talking about it. easy money. im afraid this is a sign.

1. i am crazy
2. i am worried about a bubble becuase im invested
3. i made sense of it. been buying since 2013. 
4. the bubble in my opinion can have different forms. For example, having different flavors of bitcoin being such a big cap and part of the market, makes me doubt. its redundant. 
5. the attack happening can end badly. and if it doesnt will add tons of confusion. unnecesary confusion. the bubble could be bitcoin has too much drama. and other techs dont suffer from it.
my point is, blockchain is not be a bubble, cryptocurrencies are really useful. I just think they are pushing it sometimes. they = miners, devs, companies prividing servicies. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:33:35
i guess this velocity makes no se. this is insane.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:18:09

@_date: 2017-09-23 12:53:22
he is not dead. Satoshi *is* the folks that were “working with him”. Finney, etc. Most likely.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:47:37
hehe yes! that was heaven! remember being in groups and getting automatic downloads every day. of the best shit. That was cool. Internet used to be cooler I guess. I guess im a pirate :(

the dollar has more blood on it than fuking Hitler. Some people really are annoying in denying this obvious piece of fact.

this looks like propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:11:43
very. as /btc to bitcoin cashers. both sides pretty manipulated.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:31:38
blockbuster owned the movie rentals, banks owned value transfer. 
nevermind. lets both remember this convo ;)
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:17:25
did Virgin continue selling records? Did Blockbuster continued selling/renting movies? im not bitcoin. i have most of my $ in real estate, gold and usd. just a part in crypto. 
You are a BS speaking machine. 
Just shut up and wait. Time will let u know.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:59:09
software will win. just like it won with music, video, etc. Sharing MP3s is still illegal?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:32:08
hehe true.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:59:48
maybe when its hits 100k it crashes because its a scam. Cash out before rubbing something on someone’s face.

1. wrong. software like mp3 doesnt need internet. 
2. i have 8k of mp3s. they are "mine"i guess. 
3. record selling companies didnt invent spotify, they dissapeared from the business. Like blockbuster
4. Banks are the next Blockbuster. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:19:27
well, 1% is a lot if you ask me. And would assume Satoshi / his buddies own more. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:54:46
we would know who that someone is, and have gigantic first piece of evidence. How did that person paid for 1% of the btc economy? who is that person? etc etc

Uber is a pirate company.  Operating illegally in many countries. the comparison is not right, at all

napster was some kind of exchange. The options exploded afterwards. Soulseek, audio galaxy, torrents, blogs, you name it. The channel is secondary. the innovation was the mp3 and digital audio. And boy the difference in price and convenience...

with other coins Satoshi wouldnt have that problem. If you ask me, thats huge. We dont have to agree though.

im wondering why banksters say btc is a fraud. There is no need for banks with crypto. clear to me. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:52:33
Monero is the only coin worth buying at the moment.

This is far from a solution to Bitcoin’s privacy nightmare. Eth is at least putting zerocoin on the table. They both suck in terms of privacy. And good currency is private. 
Smart money already knows this. Sheep is still pumping something so transparent that makes very little sense.
“Satoshi” cant even spend his coins in peace. Now tell me bitcoin is fungible and “pseudo anonymous”
