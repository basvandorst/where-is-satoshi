Where is when you need him?

Works on the actual keychain. I think the vignette effect I applied to the photo makes it harder to read.

makes sense. Will shrink it a touch in the next version. thanks!

Thanks! If you want to buy one, send me a DM. If not, that's cool too.

How much would you be willing to pay? 
I was thinking $20USD/$25CAD/0.002BTC +shipping outside of ConUS/Canada. Trying to pay off this laser engraver.

Not THAT invested, and honestly haven't kept up to date with some items. Will read up on it. Thanks!

That's the public key, not the private key. People can only send to that address, not sweep it. :)

was that a seg-wit joke that went over my head?
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:06:25
or, I made these for fun, and a friend wanted one. Then I realized more people might want them too.
Profit on these isn't huge. Laser engravers aren't cheap. I have to sell about 40 just to break even, and honestly, I expect to only sell a couple.
Have an upvote anyway. :)

Not sure what you mean.
To simplify: I support continuing to use cash, but this is not a good (true) argument. There are much better arguments and I feel like this one only weakens the thesis.

As someone who has had to spend time checking/counting/cashing out tills at the end of the night at various jobs, I can say the whole "debit/credit is more expensive for businesses" thing is patently false. 
The time saved on counting/balancing/rolling/depositing/etc and the complete elimination of employee theft more than make up for the fees. I imagine that now the systems even provide reports that pipe straight into accounting to make it mostly no-touch.
That said, I'm all FOR Cash - this just isn't a legit argument.

Ah! Doh! Fixed!
