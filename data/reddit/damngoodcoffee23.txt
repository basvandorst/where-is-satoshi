I truthfully hate this planet sometimes.

Even if it did happen couldn't OP just send the coins back to the address they came from?
OP is most definitely LARPing and really shitty at it too.

There are 100,000,000,000 (100 Billion) XRP. $150/XRP would be a $15 Trillion market cap. It's crypto so anything is possible, but do you really think that's likely? I don't. That said, I'll be diversifying more and might throw some BTC into XRP.

I strongly advise against this if OP is American, because they would be aiding a federal fugitive and telling everyone about it.

Fun to play with too.

I work in industrial precious metal fabrication. From my perspective this industry doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon

This guy holds

Lol wat? That's the silliest thing I've watched in a while. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:23:08
Big if true.

I work with an older guy who I overheard talking about bitcoin. After a few minutes of talking with him I realized he's been investing through bitconnect and doesn't actually know what the hell he's talking about. He seems 100% sure that it's legit and not a Ponzi scheme. I have a feeling that a lot of people in the market are equally uninformed and getting hustled.

How does that work? Aren't futures dependent on the seller upholding their end of the contract? How can you sell someone a coin that doesn't exist?

I'm personally OK with my taxes going to welfare programs, but you should come back with real arguments rather than name-calling. What exactly entitles them to our money?

It's gotta hit $9000.01 for the meme to be accurate

Well the idea of it was certainly a thing that influenced the market, but a future contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific asset for a specific price at a specific time. Unless this guy paid for the coins upfront in full he hasn't lost that money yet. I don't know enough about these things to know how much he paid in administrative fees.

OP might have shorts open and is praying it crashes so they can close it at a profit

Mods can you please address this bot issue?

OTC trades are typically below market value.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:39:31
I won't tell you what to do with your money but you'd be buying in on a huge dip. Still a risk since no one knows when it's going to bottom out.

If you had a crystal ball you might also practice Santeria

Hmm so what you're saying is I should quit my job and move to India for a few years. I've always wanted to visit Goa. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:00:50
A billion per coin? That seems unrealistic unless it replaces fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:04:45
Me too thanks

Not everyone has that kind of expendable cash dude. Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck.
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:52:44
It can't keep going up forever. Anyone have any speculations on how high it's going to get? Currently at $2550 on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:17:47
I bought some bitcoin during the upswing in 2013. Basically just took the L when the price dropped and forgot about it until I checked the price today. If I cash out now I will have more than doubled my investment. Do y'all think it's worth holding on to for now?  
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:17:03
Yeah this shit is crazy, I woke up and it's hit 2700.
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:27:40
It's not something I have the balls to do, but whether or not it works out in OP's favor is up in the air
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:09:33
You can't, and even if it was a real unit 1 sat is considered unspendable "dust" because it's worth less than the txn fee would be to send it. In reality, I imagine micropayments need to accumulate to something significant before it can be withdrawn. Kind of like how gas prices use fractions of a cent that save you a penny every 5 gallons or whatever.

Lol how heavy are those bags?

Transfering funds to and from exchanges really shouldn't count towards that.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:11:14
That's a nice chunk of change, but it's dwarfed in comparison to what it would be worth now.
