What do you mean by "truly exponential"? There are an infinite number of exponential functions that can be defined: e^x, e^(0.5*x), 2^x, 3^x, etc. just to name a few. One can dream up and curve fit a number of exponential functions to Bitcoin's price data over time. OP is curve fitting the data to some exponential function from 2011 to 2021 (which is linear on a log scale).

I thought there is a minimum fee built into the reference client. From what I understand after 0.12 some nodes will not even relay the transaction if you use a zero fee. You can send zero fee transaction, but the reason they don't confirm quickly is two fold (1) not being relayed by the majority of the nodes, and (2) being out bid by higher fees. So I would think in the future when the coinbase reaches zero, and miners are only reliant on the fees, given $1M coin, the minimum it would cost to write anything to the blockchain would be $5.

I agree with you. However, you missed my point. Litecoin for example is actually a copy of the Bitcoin source code which only changes the hashing algorithm, block times, and total number of coins (otherwise their source code is identical). Litecoin (any many other coins) is (are) literally copies of the Bitcoin source code, not the UTXO set. Bcash for example copied the source and the UTXO set, so these are all copies of Bitcoin in that regard. I'm not saying you can somehow  "copy a bitcoin (BTC)" (the unit of account), I am saying that many other coins are literal copies of the Bitcoin source code. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:24:34

Yeah but it hits a web service, `qrencode` can also output to the command line. Hitting a web service is what made OP lose 50 bucks in the first place. IMO running something locally is safer.
Edit: Not only is using `curl` hitting this web service with the domain `qrenco.de` it's allowed to use unencrypted traffic on `http` instead of `https` - this is not a good look. This site should be redirecting all `http` request to `https`.

OK let's be realistic here. I truly believe in Bitcoin, I'm fairly certain it will continue to grow. However, people need to pay for housing, gas, food, insurance, and all kinds of other things in order to go about their daily lives. So the relative value of the bitcoin to the dollar (or other fiat depending on where you live) totally matters at least at the time of this writing. Maybe in the future when more organizations and business start to accept `btc` and price their products and services in `sats` or `btc` it will not matter, but today it does.

Then you would have to put it back on Coinbase, or sell it through another channel. The point is, if you don't control your private keys Coinbase (or whatever third party) could technically run off with your coins. There have been many famous instances of exchanges being hacked (MtGox, Bitfinex), or otherwise running away with user funds. If you don't control your own private keys, you technically don't own bitcoin. 
Controlling your own private keys does introduce more friction to selling the coin for the fiat of your choice.

Was dogecoin fledgeling when they introduced inflation into their protocol? From my understanding dogecoin had been around for years already, so that's really not a very legit argument.  Additionally Doge was way more centrally controlled than Bitcoin so the developers could unilaterally make changes to the protocol (kind of like ETH today). You might have noticed the past 3ish years people and organizations attempting coups to increase the blocksize in the Bitcoin protocol and it has not happened. The 21 million cap is arguably an even more contentious parameter to alter within the consensus rules of Bitcoin so if blocksize increase attempts have failed to this point the deflationary aspect of the currency is likely not going anywhere. I would say the hard limit on tokens is one of the central tenets of bitcoin being sound money, but I suppose anything could happen.

Edit: I tried using electron cash to sweep a wallet. The sweep reported significantly less funds that were actually contained in the wallet (cross referenced with several block explorers). I decided not to broadcast the transaction and used Coinomi which showed the proper amount of funds. Possibly shady siphoning funds going on. I would avoid.

Maybe not inflation for the USD or other government currencies. You don't really understand the word inflation has different meanings in different contexts, we are clearly talking past each other. 
Look at this page explaining the total supply of Bitcoin, there is not a single place where it talks about the price of bitcoin versus goods. I'm purely talking about how Bitcoin's money supply acts over time.
You are sitting here trying to explain to me why your definition of inflation is the right one, when clearly there is more then one meaning, and they are both related to the supply of money.

I'm talking about the supply of bitcoin, monetary inflation and deflation is a thing and it's related to the money supply. 
This is a post in the Bitcoin subreddit usually people talk about the supply of bitcoins, this has made it to all, the masses seem to only understand one definition of inflation.
It's important because the supply of a currency determines whether or not the currency is inflationary or deflationary in the traditional sense. It's the difference between talking about first principles and symptoms (or results) of those first principles

Well technically you are using fiat if you are converting btc to fiat.

If they bought 5 bucks worth of bitcoin that's a profit of $0.97!!

Yeah the good ones publish and up chart along with a down chart. Then they delete the call that was wrong.

FWIW, they do not make the "Nano" anymore it is discontinued. Their new product is "Nano S". They used to have something called Ledger "HW.1" which was like the Nano.

No when you are talking about the supply of a currency such as bitcoin it's monetary inflation.

Not really, it actually went up when that photobomb news came out. It was on a down trend before the photobomb, and continues.

Why is the default sorting by market cap? Should it be sorted by the last column "difference" by default? I mean it is a site about security, and not market cap. ��‍♂️

Do you want 1 USD or 1 bitcoin (~8000 USD)? Who are these people?

This is a bullshit post. Sure you can transact using lightning in sub-satoshis, but any on-chain transaction has a minimum relay fee which is higher then 1 sat. You can broadcast 1 sat, but you will pay more than 1 sat for the minimum relay fee otherwise the network will not even see it.

Exactly, just responding to the comment, point being "back then" (in 2013) people didn't have to use "hundreds-thousands" of bitcoins when they are 200-1200 usd each to buy something.
