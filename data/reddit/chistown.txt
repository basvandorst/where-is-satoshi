None. Whatsoever. Can't believe this even got traction a couple of weeks back.

'The ads' do not collect your data. Showing or hiding them has no impact on your privacy.
Data is collected in an enormous number of ways, and even if they had zero data on you they'd still show you ads.

That last paragraph seriously needs a citation.
As someone who has seen Vitalik speak at a live event, he is much more humble than you might think.
When asked about his future plans for Ethereum, he wants to see himself removed from the network through automation/self-governance. The guy has a really great philosophy and outlook on the world in general. You might ask why should I believe him? And when he was asked that very same question, he said you shouldn't - which is why he wants to remove himself in the long term.
If you still don't trust him, don't buy ETH. That's your call.

It's just consensus though dude. An overwhelming majority wanted to HF and so it happened.
This type of consensus ruling will get harder as the network grows and more friction is in place (a la Bitcoin), but at this time it worked - you can bet it won't work again so easily.
I think people too quickly forget that Ethereum is 12 months old.

I don't get all this friction with taking Bitcoin mainstream. Mining-enabled machines would be the biggest breakthrough Bitcoin has ever seen.
We just need layers that simplify things enormously; consider right clicking your desktop and setting your mining preferences (I.e which pool) - really damn simple. That's the kind of UX we need to get to, and yes, it would help decentralise mining.

It would actually be an awesome feature of any crypto if hard forks could be voted on to negate those coins, while burning the failing business/investor at the same time.

I'm with you, I'm pro Bitcoin and Ethereum, and looking at Dash. I get tired of the BTC vs ETH trolling and I do my bit to spread awareness on both sides (that includes sticking up for BTC in Re Coinbase, I haven't touched the site, but I also see no reason to fear. [There is no evidence of any insolvency]( it's total speculation.
Let's not forget ETH was trading at $20 before The DAO crash; so I don't know how a drop from $14 to $11 is going to cause any issues for Coinbase (if that's what you're suggesting).
Take things with a pinch of salt.

That's a depressing comment to read.
Without knowing the unhealthy, poor and unemployed you'll never know the 'rut' they find themselves in.
Happiness and good health for all is what's needed for a successful government (success defined as a growing economy with a high standard of living), and you don't get to that by essentially telling 'lazy' people (who are invariably chronically depressed, unwell, mentally ill etc) to just 'get back to work'.

Last I checked ETH was about 1000% up from the start of the year, and has held above $10 with conviction.
ETC is not a shitcoin, it's a fool's coin. No one is holding ETC for the long term like Bitcoin or Ether, why?
- no dev team
- no leadership
- no unique value
Other than taking a subjectively moral high ground, or gambling on exchanges, there is no reason to touch ETC. That is the reality.

If evil twin is without limbs and has the cognition of a potato then yes.
Which is precisely why ETH will continue on the vision that it has, and the headless coin known as ETC will survive for as long as traders care to gamble.
This could all change if a serious dev team got behind ETC, but I just don't see that happening.

The network was attacked, money was stolen, and through consensus, justice was served.
We are not yet in an ideological self-governing crypto-anarchic world. So we need to take action in the most dire of circumstances. But we as a community continue to work towards that ideology.

Re 2008. It's not the same because the people invested and the people voted. What happened was, in my mind, quite brilliant.
No one expected The DAO to raise $150m. The Slockit guys were dumbfounded. For most people this was never about getting money back, it was about disabling a thief from ruining Ethereum and its hopes for a PoS system. And it was done through community consensus.
Mt Gox happened 6 years into Bitcoin, not 12 months. And it did not effect the network in the same way (15% of all coins being held by a malicious individual).
You can try and draw parallels, but unless you are close to both Bitcoin and Ethereum you're just going to keep tarring it with that brush you're flailing.
@_date: 2016-08-01 03:38:13

I don't believe anyone thought $150m was going to be raised. Certainly from the podcasts I've heard ST was dumbfounded, but I appreciate that's hardly proof of anything.
Justice is subjective, but stopping a malicious person from taking $150m seems like a fair use of the word. Of course there were consequences, but I'm sure any unbiased individual would understand the logic.
Obviously anything involving ST and Co can be looked at separately, but the core issue above is clear to me.

A private blockchain does not need to be massively distributed and decentralised like the bitcoin blockchain does. Mining is also not required as there are no need for block rewards and economic incentives if a blockchain is being run and funded by a private organisation.
It's just another way to store and interact with data. Much like a database... so I'm not entirely sure of the use case outside of being a database. I'm sure someone very smart will reveal that soon if not already.

You need to first define your meaning of failure. If it's a $0 USD market cap then that's bordering impossible.
Is there something between here and $0 USD where Bitcoin could rest? I can't imagine what scenario would lead to that - perhaps mass global regulation and Bitcoin being moved truly underground with a much much lower price. 
So really it leaves me with an 'all or nothing' stance, and the latter as I say, is extremely unlikely.
The system would need to technically and permanently fail for the zero outcome.

If machines can autonomously transfer value at near-zero cost then there are an enormous range of markets that such a technology would improve. APIs and advertising are a couple mentioned.
The big thing people underestimate is the friction that comes with taking actions online. Payments/registration/passwords.

This is very good logic to apply to the tried and tested world of traditional contractual agreements. When we talk about smart contracts all bets are off - this is an unregulated and untested technology and if people want to hard fork they bloody well can - consensus driven protocols allow it.

People always seem to generalise news outlets out of ignorance. Here's an article from a few weeks back, possibly the most positive and forward-looking Bitcoin article I have ever read (from the 'megabank' WSJ):

@_date: 2016-01-15 16:13:01
Well it uses the word 'bank'. Which is basically taboo for anyone trying to do anything progressive with money.
And that's not just a bitcoin perspective, the general populous has little positive to say about bankers, banks or banking. Silly Mike.

Exactly this, both require consensus. With consensus anything is possible.
@_date: 2016-06-24 11:23:46
This is how Wikipedia uses consensus for administering changes:
There are several factors which the presiding administrator should consider when determining if consensus should be reached. The first of these criteria should be to check if there has been a vigorous debate on the subject wherein a large range of points of view have been presented, ranging from absolute support to absolute negation, and where a large number of editors have participated in the debate and provided their opinion. The exception to this shall apply in cases of unanimity or near-unanimity.
**Once it is certain that the community has analyzed the issue in depth and at length**, the second criterion should be to check if a large percentage of persons involved in the discussion are in support of or in opposition to the idea. **Mere voting should not count in this factor** - all involved in the discussion should state their views on the subject in some degree of detail, or at least reference another's argument as their own reasoning for holding their views.
Finally, the presiding administrator should consider whether the idea is supported by a sufficiently wide margin that the following conditions would be met:
- **The decision would not be quickly reversible due to outcry over the margin by which it gained consensus.**
- **The decision would not be reversible due to general dislike of the idea itself.**

IDK if investors consider market cap to be their benchmark of ATH. Surely when we talk about ATH we mean the absolute price.

@_date: 2016-12-21 18:02:07
I asked what would drive the price close to $0.00? Seriously, in a totally rational mindset what needs to happen to Bitcoin in order to wipe our $10,000,000,000? I'm still waiting for someone to give a sensible argument. There is too much at stake for a technical issue to result in $0.00; as you say, it will just be hard forked away and we'll lose 2 years of gains.
Disclaimer; I don't believe we'll see the opposite in terms of gains either.
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:57:49
I've been in the Bitcoin game since 2011 and have an enormous appetite for risk hence my involvement. But to say that Bitcoin could hit $0.00. That's quite the statement. All of the scenarios you've stated wouldn't reach $0.00. In fact, in the worst case scenario, where Bitcoin does hit $0.00 the world is on fire anyway, so what would money matter...
Honestly, Bitcoin is risky - but even the most risk averse individual should not expect to lose 100% of their investment. You can't rationalise that. That statement is an exaggeration, but I understand it, it's used as a warning of the risks of Bitcoin, but it's still wildly irrational - as much as it is irrational to say Bitcoin will return 10,000x gains in a year.
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:19:32
I totally get that, but what you're saying is exactly the reason why one should never invest with short term profits in mind. Invest on the fundamentals and you're a goodun. Bitcoin has *the strongest fucking fundamentals of any asset class right now*. Sure, it might tank back down to $200, but OP should be considering the long game, just like how those burnt in November 2013 are close to break even today.
I know we're not talking about $0.00 anymore, but if ETC can't hit $0.00 then I don't know what can. Insanity.
@_date: 2016-12-21 12:14:42
Curious, what events do you see resulting in a near $0 price?
I would assume some fundamental floor in Bitcoin's blockchain, but wouldn't that have been discovered by now? Or the realisation of quantum computing (which would screw every industry on the planet anyway).
China/USA ban will certainly kill all the gains, but close to $0? No chance.

A node is separate to a wallet. However Bitcoin QT and other programs act as both for simplicity. However it's a pain in the arse and will take several days to download the entire block chain (required for being a node).

If I understand correctly, miners mine non-validated blocks as a means to compete with high bandwidth miners.
By mining non-validated blocks (that are minimal in bytes), they are able to start their work sooner than if they were to wait for the larger validated blocks.

That's 3 sales a second. Let's assume a 5% conversion rate and for simplicity, one purchase per user.
- 1 in 20 users make a sale
- 3 sales per second = 60 users per second

- 5.2m users per day = 1800 sales every 10 minutes

Protocols can change. Unlike you, Ethereum devs are looking out for what is best for Ethereum, not what protocol changes can make us millionaires by jacking the price. Unfortunately, those same devs in Bitcoin land get torn apart by their own toxic community.

OK, you may be interested in this.
Vitalik Buterin has outright said that Ethereum should not be used as a store of value. *However* he has ALSO said that Ethereum may get a fixed supply in the future (lead devs are still deciding this) AND Proof of Stake could add a whole new economic value to ETH.
