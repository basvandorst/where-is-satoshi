Would sell **in an instant** at $10m - not primarily because of the neat amount, but once the critics give up, the bubble bursts.

For those who bought at &lt;10K, this is all in good fun. But those who bought higher are now sitting really uncomfortably. They may have to HODL for a really long time to find bigger fools.

It was so much fun when we still had a tip-bot and you had really good trading places for drugs, with vendor ratings and shit. I always thought that what.cd should have had a "pay by btc" button and they would forward the money to the artists.

Unfortunately, the narrative of tulips and the south sea bubble leads people to believe a bubble is the climax and end of a asset price rise. So, for many, "bitcoin is in a bubble" translates into "it will pop one day and never reach the current price again". 
Of course it is in a bubble right now like it was in winter of 2013, everyone can see that with one look at the chart. Just maybe not in a terminal bubble.

Hum, it's actually pretty easy for powerful states to blacklist bitcoin addresses to make it considerably harder to spend from them. And ask Ulbricht about what he thinks how easy it is for LE to confiscate BTC.

Ok then. Wake me up when the major fiat currencies are going into hyper-inflation.

This. I've been in crypto since 2013 and despite the dip, I am still very comfy with my gains. But in the last weeks, it has been real hard not to run around gloating over the paper gains I made. 
Still, I managed. People at work, family, even GF only know I am into crypto and have been buying a bit. Only my other GF who is into crypto as well knows the true figures. So, no one is lambasting me with "told you so" today.  
I can fully understand people telling everyone they hit a gold mine, but just - don't. Others will feel envious as prices rise, might FOMO buy in and be very grumpy when the market turns bearish.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:59:49
Got news for you, man: bitcoin is utterly incapable of replacing even one of the big fiat currencies, let alone all. 
The future maybe is Blockchain-based currencies (or tangle, or similar), but it won't be BTC. Too many technical problems, power consumption is ridiculous, too expensive, and so on.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:24:46
Well then I don't see Bitcoin at $10m ever. The idea of an asset in a deflationary tail-spin replacing fiat is over, at least for me.
But that's not my main point - I would sell for ETH, XMR, EUR, USD - anything that can escape the crash. Heck, even gold *yuck*.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:28:39

If BCH is an alt (despite it having the same genesis block), then BTC is an alt as well.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:45:38
I don't see an emergency hard fork towards a bigger block size happen. Core developers would lose their face to BCash and the animosity between the stakeholders is too great for that. 
IMO, it's looking bleak - the level 2, off-chain solution is at least half a year off, an emergency solution is blocked by pride, SW adoption is slow, the chain is overloaded, and finally the rest of the world is waking up to crypto currencies. It's a perfect storm for BTC.
I'd really like to know whether Core devs ever ran simulations on the impact of boosting block sizes vs. LN vs. a master node architecture. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:35:20
I already partly re-balanced out of the Bitcoin family and towards the biggest alts for exactly the same reason. As a deflationary asset, it should not be a surprise that the price goes up and up and up - but at the same time fewer and fewer people are actually using it. I have no idea how this is going to end, but it defeats common sense.


It's mean, but that in fact would drive the price even higher - lower supply on the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:51:45
That's what Misenians will tell you. However, it also means that demand is slowing (not fully dying, just slowing down). That means enterprises have a harder time selling their goods and that means they will lay off people. People on the dole have less money to spend, so demand goes down again. Misenians will rip me a new one, but inconsiderate spending is good for employment and economical growth.
And of course, there's the other effect: taking out a loan (for investing in new machinery) makes sense in an inflationary environment as the money you have to pay back becomes less in relation to the goods you manufacture - that's why we have interest for the investors.
In a deflationary environment, there is either zero or negative interest (good luck finding investors) or your loan gets harder and harder to pay back. Both not conductive to economical growth.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:38:08

Actually, I have been cut the % I hold in BTC partly because of both subs.

Oh and good job trying to sell that fast transactions or low fees are somehow unimportant to the uninformed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:02:54
You may feel enlightened, but there is no one real Bitcoin (as defined by the WP) left. There are two altcoins that both claim the title.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:05:27
You could always go back to the code to see the original block size or how SW and LN were implemented. That code is the original definition of bitcoin together with the wp. And tx speed as well as price are  typical non-functional requirements you always have in software dev.
I have no beef with the fundamental changes needed to make bitcoin into a halfway usable global payment system, but calling Bcash an alt while BTC is much farther from the original bitcoin is mental gymnastics on an impressive level

In a way, every fork that goes back to the Genesis Block mined by His Holiness is Bitcoin. OTOH, there is no bastardized Bitcoin in the wild, because Mr. Satoshi published a version 0.9 that has been superseded because it could not scale to million times its original scale (surprise).

Yeah I know. They even have this bug that prevents the block reward going to zero and consequentially will lead to eternal inflation if they don't fix it (

IDK, maybe they could make dogecoin-qt mine at low CPU prio while it is running to try and stabilize the network after block rewards go down, but there's a lot of danger on the horizon. Personally I kinda like this because it deters investors, but I hope nobody bets the farm on doge...

No, it is not about charity, it is about rights and obligations. Charity will never work on the level of a whole society, there's way too much to be gained by not being charitable. Once you tell the rich that they better pay their taxes or else the guys with the guns will be coming, most will pay unless your country is very corrupt. Then a lot more money will be spent because the poor need to spend more of their income than the rich. And spent money is earned money and so taxing creates more jobs and more wealth.

The Dogecoin subreddit is what should have been: a fun place of friendly redditors. has devolved into a circlejerk of anarcho-capitalist/libertarian misers and speculators that are trying to either push a political agenda or making even more profit. The irony bites that those "voluntarists" are not able to fund anything, yet those who like shitty memes easily do - even if their coin has a 300x lower market cap.
Dogecoin actually still *has* a community, they had "save dogemas" where millions of Doge were collected to give to those who had their coins stolen on christmas. Here, there are no longer tips, there are no fun projects, few donation rallys. 
Quite likely, Dogecoin will be the second coin accepted for reddit gold, leaving litecoin behind.

Dogecoin takes out the massively over-inflated expectations of one fringe political group and deconstructs a dead serious and economically unsound agenda. What's not to like?
Look, if the crypto-revolution does not survive mockery, then it should better die fast, because then it stands *no* chance against real resistance.
What's more they inject inflation into the holy deflationary system and thereby show a real-world flaw in the idea that you can just by some mathematics force human behavior.
Don't get me wrong, I find bitcoin impressive, both technologically as well as in its political agenda - only thing is that I don't like this agenda.

Invictus is in love with "distributed autonomous corporations", networks of computers delivering a certain service for which humans pay and in turn set bounties so that humans provide services like hosting. The bitcoin network would be one of the few existing examples.
Now if someone wants to set up such a DAC, he would sell Bitshares to investors which would receive dividends if the service florishes. Since Bitshares are not yet existent, you can buy Protoshares and Angelshares (will be converted to Bitshares) now and hope for a price hike.
It is all very much theoretical right now and I would regard it as a gamble. If it gets accepted by developers and innovators, it could be huge, but it also could turn out a complete flop.
Here's a thread about Angelshares:

Actually you can. Where I come from, healthcare is both affordable to everyone, jointly paid for by companies and workers and quite good. Those who want even more can buy private plans. Whereas the more privatized healthcare sector in the US is a costly nightmare.
My health is not a common property but healthcare is (or should be). Same for public education, roads, railways. Those with stronger shoulders have the responsibility to shoulder a bigger burden so that others have a head start.
I don't like the libertarian/ancap-features of bitcoin and am quite happy to see how they and their fans relegate it to a costly asset class. To me, it is a speculative vehicle that has made me real money, but it is hopefully not the future of currencies. And the Cambrian explosion in altcoins is the surest sign that bitcoin will not outright fail but will never get a chance to pressure states into libertarian voodoo economics.

Well there are rumors about scrypt ASICs coming for months now. However, since scrypt is much more demanding on memory, I don't think the performance will be that much higher than GPUs - unlike SHA256 where ASICs blow everything else out of the water.
I think the only real danger is some Chinese operation building ASICs in secret and deploying a truckload of them in secret and then pulling a 51% on Doge (or Litecoin).

Miners still get tx fees. This could go both ways - either the coin gains a lot of value and tx fees make mining worth the effort or it crashes because of a 51% attack.

Of course the value of each bitcoin is vastly higher, but this goes to show that easy-to-mine, abundant coins with a happy and friendly community do stand a chance to establish themselves.
Let's see how long it lasts - but at this rate, I'd say Doge has a fair chance to become No.2 instead of Litecoin.
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:20:38
I'd say the only thing that prevents the loss of confidence in fiat is that there are no serious crisis symptoms. If the prophets of doom were right, we should be in the first wave of hyperinflation now, after all it was foretold years ago and QE has been going on for some time.
Usually those things go like: nothing, nothing, nothing, problem disappeared.
but hey, to each his own - if you believe in the upcoming death of fiat, it makes perfect sense to go all in crypto.

Nice visualization, I think you have a good point.
I'll try to explain, but of course explaining after an observation is not very sound.
- The peak between the crash dip and the twin dips is a dead-cat-bounce. Price tries to recover but ultimately fails and dips until if finds a bottom. The whole period crash dip -&gt;  last of the twin dips is actually one in which we have an oscillating price in a price band or wedge.
- The pre-rally: after some months of not much movement, bitcoin stirs and this causes a bit of media exposure. People who learn about it buy leading to a moderate rise. However, there are still some old bitcoin holders who got burned buying way too high and which are inexperienced speculators. So they sell into the rise and this hype fizzles. 
- The final dip could be an artifact - in 2013 it was the busting of silk road and therefore an externality.
FWIW, added some observations I believe are relevant in green: 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:17:19
All I can say is when I found it was more fun, there were more tips thrown around, more research papers making the top ten.
Then with the rising valuation it was all about "get rich quick" and the tips stopped
Then with the bad political news, this subreddit became very hostile and defensive.
Llke it or not, doge is a fun-oriented community that is much kinder and does not take itself so goddam serious.

@_date: 2014-01-11 11:07:18
Well some economist (like Tyler Cowen from marginal revolution blog  think so.
Given that BTC hit $1200 per coin last December up from $20 or so in January, this effect cannot be that huge - if it exists at all, I'd say it would be somewhat healthy and take some of the insane volatility off bitcoin.
HOWEVER, I believe the network effect ( is huge for currencies and therefore I think the altcoins - with the notable exception of Litecoin - will not make a dent. I'd say Doge is the other exception because it caters to the internet fun crowd - but Doge will not reach a really high valuation.

I found this rather balanced. Krugman discusses the difference between objective and normative critizism.


Bull. Cowen should know what the network effect is and how it applies to cryptos.


Careful with that. They could conceivably drop in value A LOT. You should exchange most into fiat  and only keep a smallish part. Also: be prepared for the - unlikely - case that contrary to the network effect one coin with very novel features takes the crown.

@_date: 2018-02-22 09:08:46
Bitcoin will not be the leader in that space forever. If you bought ETH early last year, you could have made more money than with BTC. 
In the end, I don't see why owning part of a money transmitting system should be worth so much. The economy behind BTC is tiny and there is no real-world usage. I bought a bit of BTC in 2013, so I made a profit. If you are buying BTC in 2018, you pay for the lambos of early adopters, but it is very questionable if someone will pay for yours.
There are some tokenized securities and PoS coins that pay dividends - in the long run, they will outperform BTC, imo.
In investing, you better look where the puck is going, not where it is right now.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:30:21
There is absolutely no level playing field. Early adopters had it very easy, just throw a bit of computing power or a couple of meals into BTC and you are way ahead.

1. The community around bitcoin has become completely toxic. This here sub has been an interesting and friendly place around 2013 and - together with become shitty. Most other cryptos have a much nicer community.
2. I hope BTC never makes it to a world currency. After BTC inflation goes down and turns to deflation due to lost coins, it would cause an economic disaster of unclear proportions. Inflation punishes the hodler and encourages lending and investing, deflation does the opposite.
3. Utility of BTC has drastically declined. I used to pay with it back then, but now have switched to faster and cheaper currencies like ETH or LTC if I want to pay for something. This may change in the future again, but currently, BTC to me is digital gold - precious, but completely impractical for every day use.

I am pretty sure energy density of rechargeable batteries is closing in on oil. Electricity will take over driving, and for chemistry, there will be enough crude for a long time. After that, gas.

Deflationary currencies are a much bigger danger than peak oil, as they encourage idleness and hodling.

- After the German election, Merkel is probably much more amendable to soft conditions than with Cyprus
- Everyone and their dog know that Greece is a very troubled state that will be on financial life support for years to come, so I doubt a lot of capital will get more nervous.

Re-visited it in 2011 and thought you had to mine them and my aging MacBook would not have mined much.
Read again about them in early 2013 and tried to buy. Bitcoin24 absconded with 350€ of my money. Was too burned to try again. 
When the April bubble hit, Gox would not create and verify my account.
Bought finally in June  and held through the fall down to 75. Sold

So you have witnessed one financial crash and now are convinced that it will repeat every 10 years?
I beg to differ. There is currently no indication that the next big bubble is building. And even if it was, what good would transferring your savings to BTC be? BTC itself suffered a boom-and-bust cycle twice and there is absolutely no guarantee that the current valuation is sustainable.
And with the size of the BTC economy right now, it would be trivial for a national bank or even a larger financial situation to create a dollar peg. Buy enough BTC to become a whale and then manipulate the price to keep it at a certain level. 
No matter how much we value the independence of BTC, it is after all only a question of financial firepower to create or stop bubbles and crashes in BTC.

9) Investment in a bitcoin-economy can work. False. Investment competes with the deflationary rise in purchasing power and will - except for some high risk gambles, fail.
10) Deflationary economies without a high level of poverty and unemployment are possible. False. Since consumer credit vanishes and investment is curbed, a lot of business will either fail or never be founded leading to high levels of unemployment.
11) Availability of food and basic necessities in a deflationary economy are still granted. False. While inflation leads to overproduction, deflation leads to systemic underproduction to balance the rise in purchasing power of hoarded money. For those stuck by 10), hunger will again be a real possibility.
12) Deflation will make us all more wealthy. False. Those who are rich today and those with above-average income will profit because their savings rate is high and the rising purchasing power of their stash multiplies that. Those who are poor today or make-do on a small wage will become poorer

Sure does, most purchases over here are validated online via a system called "Electronic cash" ( You swipe your card, enter a PIN code and the merchants POS terminal contacts the bank to check if you got the money. Takes less than 30s and afaik the supermarket has zero risk, but has to pay something like 0.3-1% as a fee.
Basically that's why you can't pay with credit cards in our supermarkets. And that's why I see a hard time for XBT over here (ironically, since Germany is touted as one of the premier bitcoin-friendly countries).

1) why do you ignore the confiscation? I has happened and will happen again. Ignoring it is just ignoring facts.
2) So if you invested your dollars in the Dow, you now had more than 8x what you had back then. Including dividends, you probably have offset the loss of purchasing power.
This is what I was aiming at in my posting: it does not matter if the dollar lost 96% of purchasing power if wages have risen proportionally since then and you could have preserved your wealth by indiscriminately buying shares.

That may be so, but this is just facebook traffic, it is not easy (or even possible) to monetize, except for donations. And, those people are the exception, most living in poverty will not have tons of followers.
In contrast, everyone who earns an above-average salary can easily convert 10-20% into bitcoins and live off that stash later on. The Austrians call this "temporal preference", what they really mean is that poor people should stay hungry because they don't save.
Bitcoin could enable easy transfer of donations, but on the other hand, its deflationary nature will make the poor poorer and the rich richer.

Interesting: BTC are not regarded as legal tender (OK, no surprise) and purchases are therefore liable for VAT (19% in Germany). They regard it as a good like apples or bricks even though the call it "private money".

The attack is not about double-spending BTC to make money, the attack is about double spending as a means to shatter trust in BTC. 
BTC lives and dies with it's user's trust. Create some provable double-spends and a lot of people will jump ship.


Too complicated for Joe Sixpack. Again, this is not about completely shutting down BTC traffic but weakening the network and reducing the number of users. As I see it, P2P has a strong network coefficient: the more people use it, the more useful it gets - BTC is no different here than Bittorrent.


That's what I was thinking of. For the horse battery thingy, there's transactions every other minute. A DDOS would create thousands of transactions per second. Currently, the network processes something like 55K transactions/d (blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions).

BTC get lost all the time and are unrecoverable, so supply is shrinking.
This of course is hailed by all the Austro-fanboys, but in the end it will lead to BTC's collapse: it gets divided and divided again to maintain usability as an exchange token - after all, a major economy needs a certain amount of tokens to keep a certain velocity of economic transactions.
So let's say some 200 years from now, the economy of a medium-sized industrialized country with an M3 of 1 trillion Dollar-equivalent runs on 1000 BTC - so we have to subdivide BTC to 9 decimal places to get a token equivalent to one Dollar, just to give you a measure.
Now, my great-great-grandson discovers my paper wallet with BTC 1000 in it and throws them on the market. This would create in one instant a really severe trust crisis in BTC, because without any effort, he is the richest man in history and with that firepower, he can easily short-sell whole parts of the economy and pump and dump stocks at will. Not to mention we'd get - in a generally deflationary setting - an extreme and unprecedented inflationary shock. It would be fun to feed a monetary supply increase of one year GDP into an existing economic model and see what happens.
With moderate inflation, forgotten riches don't become "too big to own", but with the two sources of severe deflation in BTC (lost coins and maybe international adoption on a large scale), new weapons of financial mass destruction could emerge.
The looming thread of such an event increases decade after decade if supply dwindles and economies grow because the ratio of (lost + hoarded)/circulating btc increases steadily. At some point, centrally issued currencies with a controlled inflation target become the lower risk assets because, back of the envelope, risk = severity * probability.
The risk profile of a well-managed, centrally controlled inflationing currency is low severity * high probability (this is what we experienced since the 1950)
The risk profile of btc is at first low severity * low probability but over time moves to extremely high severity * very low probability. And at some point, the severity of those "black swan" events will be enough to motivate risk controllers in companies and governments alike to abandon BTC.

The same will be true for this new load of hogwash. Large financial institutions will happily integrate XBT to lower their costs and rationalize operations. Once they are convinced, internet retailers will happily accept XBT because of no chargebacks.
And nation states will continue to thrive and collect taxes in fiat for the forseeable future.

Leftist liberal.
I can't say I like some of the potential outcomes of a stronger BTC adoption like tax avoidance, neutering of fiscal policy and probably slowing economic growth (or even recession). I still believe a built-in demurrage would have been better, but what can you do?
However, I believe Alt-coins are here to stay, be it BTC, be it something else. So I am rather an early adopter than trying to close my eyes. And I am really pissed off about the continuous transfer of wealth towards banksters and the already rich upper class. So if BTC can put a stopper on that, all the better.

Bitcoin is more than gold, which is mostly a dead store of value. Bitcoin is a currency and currencies thrive on the network effect - they get more useful the more people use them. This depends on spending to keep merchants interested in accepting bitcoin.
If every mom-and-pop store accepts bitcoin, they will be much more useful and valuable than if only a handful of geeks keeps them tight to speculate on further price hikes..

True, I'd never argue otherwise.
However, when it comes to the creation of wealth (in opposition to dead storage), how have we fared after gold ceased to be *the* currency?
You cite the total gold valuation as $12t (a bit high, 8-9 is more like it) and the global M3 as around $50t.
So by far most of the wealth is not in gold, it is in other assets and money. When gold was the dominant currency, I expect (however, I have no data) that a higher percentage of the global wealth was held in gold - if only because there were no competing currencies.
Basically, I think your main error is: 


Price is determined by demand and supply. Holding them tight decreases supply and drives the price up, that's true. However if you spend them, someone accepts them and is getting used to accepting them - after all, a merchant will stop accepting bitcoin if his customers only use them very infrequently. The more shops accept bitcoin, the higher the demand will be, driving price up too.
With the current ratio of hoarders vs. users, the total market cap is around $1.3b and no longer rising significantly. Credit card transactions are on the order of $7b - if bitcoin could capture only half of this market, the increased demand would definitively drive the price up.

No system is invulnerable, neither is BTC. Some possible attacks:
1) build a huge hangar of ASIC miners and gain 30% of global hashing power or more and inject double spends every now and then to undermine trust in BTC
2) Control the exchanges to throttle convertability
3) Build deep packet inspecting filters to block or slow down BTC P2P-Traffic. If attempted by only one nation-state, this is not very effective, but if some join forces, the network fragments and confirmation times skyrocket
4) DDOS the P2P-network with small transactions to hinder confirmations of legit transactions.
None of those is 100% effective, but any or a combination could severely shake trust and thereby lower interest of all but the most fervent BTC fans. This could shrink the BTC economy back to where it was in 2011.

Then obviously they bring something to the table that BTC does not. But I don't see that happening anytime soon.
BTC started out as an experiment and then as a hacker's playground and only after that came serious economic importance. Now we have got a lot of alt-coins that are still in an experimental phase.
The idea of *one true* cryptocurrency is flawed. There is not only one open-source HTTP server like there is not only one open-source OS. And so there will be other coins besides BTC. To me the better altcoins have value as an incubator where new ideas are tested and discussed. Don't be sad about wasted engineering talent - those guys want to do their own and in so doing produce code and concepts that could be useful for BTC. You could not orchestrate them to work on BTC because they are vastly different in their coding and problem-solving skills. As with every challenging open-source project, a small team needs to work on the core.
Maybe years down the road, we even see a multilateral altcoin economy where specialized coins carve out their respective ecological niche - if BTC does not add zerocoin then we may see some coin more geared towards anonymity whereas another coin could offer faster transactions. We might even see "official" coins backed by amazon, gov'ts and banks. 
With BTC so deeply entrenched because of its first-mover advantage, I am quite confident that the high time of trashcoins is almost over. Most of those will simply vanish because they are clones and don't add value. People will toy around with those and then drop them - over at cryptsy, you can see a lot of those zombie coins. In fact those are the penny-stock of the cryptocurrency world - some people like to burn their fingers trying to fool others in buying 10K of some worthless coin. People will flock back to the more solid coins until someone creates something groundbreaking new.

At least doubtful because the price of a currency in it's own economy (ie. not against any other currency but against goods) depends on the balance of demand and supply. So any technological breakthrough can increase supply and therefore drop price.
The thing is: you cannot successfully create a monetary union between very competitive and backwards economies, the Euro zone is a prime example. The same will happen if btc is adopted universally - some economies (China, the US, Germany, Israel) will profit, others (Middle East, Africa) will crash.

Because anarcho-capitalism openly advocates a dog-eats-dog world. I am all for personal liberties, but I do not want to live in an unregulated world - the only ones thriving under those circumstances are crooks and sociopaths. Those of us who have family rather have a state that tries to ensure some minimal standards and common rules like a minimal wage or some oversight over how retirement funds are managed.
What's more, I'd rather have the state build the roads I use instead of having to ponder which road today will be the most affordable. I don't want to buy access rights to public space in tiered plans that change all the time and try to sell you some road access across the country for cheap if you sign up for expensive use of roads in your home town. 
I'd rather have some social security if I fall seriously ill instead of some smug asshole telling me that my temporal preferences seem to indicate that right now I'd rather not work but occupy a hospital and therefore (without any force, of course!) they'll take away my home and any possession. I'd rather live in a society where GDP grows 1% slower instead of one where child labor is A-OK because (without any force, of course!) children rather work than starve. I'd rather have a state that taxes everybody and helps the weak than a state where the sun shines on the best and brightest and the weaker are thrown under a bus (without any force, of course!). I'd rather have the same protection for anyone as a goal than openly advocating that the rich and proud can buy themselves cream-of-the-crop private protection to stomp the poor into the ground.
I do not for one second believe that a-cap societies would be more peaceful. On the contrary, they'd be about as peaceful as medieval ones or Somalia is today. I hail from a country where you are not allowed to carry weapons and consequently murder rates are 1/6 of those in the US.
A-Cap is for me an idea that would appeal to young men that feel invincible. Once they grow older and learn that most likely neither they nor their loved ones are in fact invulnerable they should grow out of it.

Talking to Austrians is like discussing with the Taliban.
1) A deflationary economy amplifies any existing debt. Since you'd need more and more purchasing power to pay off the debt chances are, you'll never
2) for the same reason, deflationary economies lead to poverty. Investment usually requires debt. Furthermore hoarding yields a ROI a normal company will never. Therefore where debt-based economies have a oversupply problem, deflationary ones lead to starvation.
3) a deflationary spiral leads to a narrower and narrower market because less and less people can afford the asset until you sit on $1 trillion worth of coins you cannot sell because you'd crash the market. In the end, bitcoin might be so successful that there is no more market for it.

We have heard the same about censorship and the internet 15 years ago (
No, you cannot technically shut down bitcoin just like you cannot censor the internet. What you **can** do and what is done is censor the internet enough to deter 95% of people from finding the loopholes (China, Iran, Australia).
The net and bitcoin live and die by their network effect: make them unavailable to 95% of the population and they are essentially worthless. If the US shuts down the easy fiat-&gt;XBT gateways, bitcoin is back at the hacker-and-drug money stage.

@_date: 2013-09-06 15:23:52
I can see a huge shit-storm brewing if this gets added retroactively to the protocol. Since we can assume that x% of coins get lost every year, recreating them after y years means we get some kind of shadow inflation (or better: curb deflation).
I don't see how this is going to go down with the low-brow libertarians that make up a sizable portion of bitcoin fans.

IDK, but doing TA on bitcoin is fraught with problems - the market is very immature, it is completely unregulated and black swan events like the SR bust are frequently.
I don't say never do TA here but don't read too much into it, and this is where that chap crossed the line: the SR closing should not be part of any pattern.

If I were a government:
- force businesses to use only registered bitcoin addresses for transactions and make it a crime to use any other address. Additionally, force businesses to send btc only to other registered addresses in b2b transactions.
- Try and match orders and sales both in bitcoin and fiat to see if something is unaccounted for
- Require businesses that pay wages in bitcoin to declare the receiving address and/or force employees to register their receiving address 
- Create analytics tools that can trace bitcoin flow between registered addresses to match against the orders, sales and wages as declared. So if some company sells 200 tires to a repair shop for 325 bitcoin, this has can be traced, both on paper and in the blockchain. The 325 btc of course will be partly used to buy raw materials and this can be traced too. If something is unaccounted for, send the inspectors.

BTC get lost all the time and are unrecoverable, so supply is shrinking.
This of course is hailed by all the Austro-fanboys, but in the end it will lead to BTC's collapse: it gets divided and divided again to maintain usability as an exchange token - after all, a major economy needs a certain amount of tokens to keep a certain velocity of economic transactions.
So let's say some 200 years from now, the economy of a medium-sized industrialized country with an M3 of 1 trillion Dollar-equivalent runs on 1000 BTC - so we have to subdivide BTC to 9 decimal places to get a token equivalent to one Dollar, just to give you a measure.
Now, my great-great-grandson discovers my paper wallet with BTC 1000 in it and throws them on the market. This would create in one instant a really severe trust crisis in BTC, because without any effort, he is the richest man in history and with that firepower, he can easily short-sell whole parts of the economy and pump and dump stocks at will. Not to mention we'd get - in a generally deflationary setting - an extreme and unprecedented inflationary shock. It would be fun to feed a monetary supply increase of one year GDP into an existing economic model and see what happens.
With moderate inflation, forgotten riches don't become "too big to own", but with the two sources of severe deflation in BTC (lost coins and maybe international adoption on a large scale), new weapons of financial mass destruction could emerge.
The looming thread of such an event increases decade after decade if supply dwindles and economies grow because the ratio of (lost + hoarded)/circulating btc increases steadily. At some point, centrally issued currencies with a controlled inflation target become the lower risk assets because, back of the envelope, risk = severity * probability.
The risk profile of a well-managed, centrally controlled inflationing currency is low severity * high probability (this is what we experienced since the 1950)
The risk profile of btc is at first low severity * low probability but over time moves to extremely high severity * very low probability. And at some point, the severity of those "black swan" events will be enough to motivate risk controllers in companies and governments alike to abandon BTC.

- If you got wind of an impeding FBI investigation focussed at you, you'd wipe the server *now*
- If you were in for stealing funds, you'd do so and just abscond with everything.

Risk evaluation cannot be based on trust in the rational (or let's say nice) behavior of a single individual. Furthermore, I don't see why it would be self destructive - given the chance I would dump a fat wad of that treasure to buy up lots and lots of property. After the shock, this will rise in price like mad.


So *drumroll* Helicopter Ben did not lay the ax to the financial foundations of the US unlike libertarians claim? QE will not destroy the Dollar and we can take off the tinfoil hats? No disagreement on my part, but tell this to ... 
FWIW, you are confusing M0 and M2. QE money was dumped to prop up an illiquid banking system, *not* thrown on the market, so there was no sudden increase in demand. Instead it went straight to the bankster's coffers.

Well, there are second-round effects. With every item less sold, one company makes a bit less profit and if it does over a longer time, they will sack some employees.
If this happens at one company only, it is not so bad. If it affects whole sectors of the worldwide economy, it will create an economic crisis that feeds on itself because people cling to their money if their future looks gloomy.
Furthermore, why would anyone invest in anything but the most hyped product if hoarding money is free of risk, less work and still they get richer?

- While there are a lot of businesses that send $20k+ around the world on a daily basis, SMBs usually don't. What's more, not in every part of the world is the banking system as broken as in the US. SEPA'ing money, for example, is not much more expensive than sending XBT.

It is interesting to see how Shostak clutches to the traditional definitions of money to defend the view that BTC cannot establish itself as a currency:


This is a complete non-sequitur. Just because money up to this point always had a material bond does not make this a neccessary condition - it is, for all we know, a tradition.
Interestingly, his citation


could cut both ways: if and when BTC proves to be more marketable than fiat, it should replace it. Not that I believe this will happen over the next few years, but there is some merit to believe that a fully digital currency is more marketable than the digital/physical hybrid we are used to.


I don't get this. Silk Road has shown that for some specialized market, a new kind of money can be bootstrapped - while volatility currently is way over the top, a price-finding has happened for sure.


I am not sure what is obvious here. It is so damned hard to trade in money for BTC that a lot of BTC is either hoarded or circulated via reddit gold, Silk Road or other companies that accept it and trade it for goods. So in a way, the obstacles erected by credit card companies and banks make it more likely that a BTC economy can emerge and survive.
I guess a lot of Austros have such a gold fixation they will defend it rabidly. Too bad.

Well I don't see why it would be hard for a government to tax a developed economy, no matter what currency is preferred. The government can either accept taxes in bitcoin or in fiat. 
If the gov't sticks to fiat, there is an upper bound to the percentage XBT can take over, and indirectly a price ceiling. If they start accepting coins, they'll probably force companies to register addresses with the tax authorities and us the blockchain to build automated controlling tools.

The exchanges are not part of the bitcoin protocol or the technological ecosystem. They are the gateways to the traditional currencies. Bitcoin in theory can exist without exchanges in a closed ecosystem where people work for bitcoins and pay their potatoes with them. We are not there and I doubt we'll ever get there large scale. But isn't it curious that no exchange system is part of the bitcoin spec paper and instead money creation is implemented as mining?
Bitcoin is not exactly regulation-friendly but also not hostile to regulation (zerocoins would be hostile to regulation).
The point of bitcoin is a trustless, yet trustworthy secure system of divisible, fungible, exchangeable digital tokens. We don't even know if it was an experimental setup that was taken more serious than intended or if the intention for it to become an international currency was there from the beginning.

This is at least very doubtful. And it's just like your opinion, man.
And I cannot see why higher prices would lead to less hoarding. The new price becomes the new normal and people still buy to transfer a certain amount of wealth into bitcoin storage. Does not matter if a coin costs $10 or $1000.
Anyhow, thin market is just what my first comment was aiming at: for a functioning economy, you need enough coins and a certain velocity of circulation. Hoarding hurts both.

Made up numbers, but the principle should be clear:
If you are poor you have to spend maybe 75% of what you earn for rent, food, clothing, 20% on non-vital stuff like going to the movies.
If you are rich, you have to spend maybe 30% on vitals and 5% on non-vitals.
So the poor can save 5%, the rich 65%. Even if the poor were to live a extremely frugal live, their ability to save would be lower than that of the rich. And of course 10% of a high income is much more than 10% of a low one.
Therefore high taxes for well-to-do and tax breaks or wellfare benefits for the poor make total sense.

Please, this is completely flawed.
1) the repatriation of the German gold has already started

3) Bitcoin is managed by a handful of random strangers. Do you really believe the German gov't would speculate with something that is unproven technology, controlled by some geeks? The German central bank is not in the forex speculation business.
4) Germany is one of the most pro-Euro countries there is. I see no reason why Merkel would ditch the Euro. And even if her gov't did that, it would be back to the German Mark.

@_date: 2013-08-19 06:24:47


Wrong, as of today.
Bitcoin today has a target (natural) inflation rate of 12% ( and is currently overshooting it. In July, the inflation rate was actually double the target:


Now, this high inflation rate has no bad effects because the BTC economy is expanding like crazy. Should the demand go down however (US Congress tries to ban BTC or something), the price would go down, a lot of miners suddenly are sitting on equipment not making a profit and stop mining and selling their gear and at least partly their stash, further putting pressure on the price. And then the high inflation rate would really bite.
DO NOT invest all your savings in BTC, it is a HIGH RISK thing. Since you don't fully understand BTC (neither do I, btw.), be fucking CAREFUL and only invest or save as much as you can afford to lose.

1) The problem is US-specific. Other countries don't have laws that legalize highway-robberies

Wait, you used a preview of an Operating System to store money? Incredible.
@_date: 2013-09-27 08:16:58
Well, truth be told, I am even torn on this. After all, when a bank goes titsup, the money in their customer's account is usually mostly gone, so in an unregulated economy you get back 10c on the Dollar. It used to be that way for hundreds of years.
Now we have banks that are deemed to big to fail and if they tumble the state intervenes and shuts them down in an orderly fashion taking money from large accounts to satisfy obligations.
The flip side is that still a lot of public money is used to ensure the shutdown is orderly, that small savers are protected and customers who took out loans with the failed bank are not thrown at the sharks.
So while I think it is lamentable that people's accounts are touched, I don't think the gen pop has any obligation to reimburse customers of failed banks. If a millionaire loses 900K, this is bad, but having Joe Sickpack pay for him is even worse.
The solution is easy: if you got lots of money, don't put it all in a bank. YOU are responsible, no one else. Don't like bail-ins? Stash the stuff into your mattress.

I believe there are currently four main reasons for the rising interest in BTC:
1) As a refugee currency and stable asset class
2) Out of techno-geekery
3) Anarcho-capitalism and libertarians, all central institutions shall burn thinking
4) Speculation
I believe, only 4) would partly profit and therefore agree with the current volatility, 2) and 3) would not care that much and 1) should loath it.
So, I believe that if the volatility does not diminish over time, the spikes and crashes might not strengthen BTC but driving away a lot of those looking for a stable asset to protect their wealth.

I ain't either. The current volatility is maybe just teething pains, but otoh it is completely killing the utility value of bitcoin as a currency. Whoever accepted a $900 bitcoin yesterday night for goods is now $200 poorer, this is not a great way to do business.
It could be that bitcoin just gains enough "weight" that traders can no longer game the market and the volatility goes down. If it does not, bitcoin will forever be regulated to the role of a gambler's asset. 
I believe that some mega-corps or govts will take the convenience parts of bitcoin and create a more regulated version which might have a chance to become a widely accepted currency. But of course this will have an inflation target.

If I were you, I'd buy bitcoins now for 25% of your sum. Then set a limited buy (on Bitstamp or another platform that supports it) for 50% @ $500 and another for the last 25% @ $300.

This is all nice and dandy, but kind of delusional.
I still remember the early years of the internet, where a common theme was that it's impossible to censor the net because the net treats censorhip as a defect and routes around it. Which was a nice cozy idea but did not work out that great. Technically, you still cannot censor the net, but you can keep 95% of all people from accessing certain resources which is enough for most intents and purposes.
The same is true for BTC. Even today, it is hard to convert fiat to BTC, localbitcoins nonwithstanding. Most people out there will stick with fiat if it does not become drastically easier to purchase and use BTC. And govt can up the ante even more by putting pressure on the exchanges. Currencies live and die by their network effects - make no mistake, if the use of BTC falls under a certain (hard to define) threshold, they will devalue and even more people will convert back to fiat. Big if, but the BTC economy has this achilles heel - bring down free convertability and you bring down this economy.

I don't think this is possible because you have this proof of work to generate coins.
But even if it was, the fact that A sent BTC to B would still be recorded. If you then see new BTC coming from the same address, it is easy to connect them to the previous transaction and therefore indirectly to A. If they were coming from a different address, this new address would still need to prove that it has "creation rights" for whatever amount and to make those safe against forgery, they would need to be linked to the original receiving address.
For untraceable BTC, the transactions would need to be private from the start, because even if they were later deleted from the blockchain, anyone with the ability to keep constant records could restore them.

OK, I take a stab at what this means:
Currently, bitcoin.de is simply a broker. They offer the platform like localbitcoins, but the trades are between individuals. After striking a deal, you SEPA the money to the other party which then sends you the BTC (to your bitcoin.de wallet). So, you do not SEPA to bitcoin.de, but otoh, you do not meet with some stranger, cash in hand.
Now, I guess they found a banking partner willing to provide a clearing account for them. So in the future, you probably send the money to bitcoin.de for escrow and the seller sends the BTC to them - like any other exchange.
This could be huge - their current system is very professional and nice to work with, but you cannot really trade.

Mature markets have established players that react differently (I'd say less emotionally) to ups or downs.

Then you have to spend it. It is bs to believe in bitcoin as a store of wealth. Yes, it can be that, but it is much more intelligent than that. If it was not a currency and payment system then yes, you should just stay invested. But it is much richer than that, so spread the love.

Well I guess there are several counter-arguments:
1) It would be hard to sell that many coins because it would completely exceed market size. However, this is where the inflationary shock would really kick in.
2) It is completely unlikely that bitcoin is going to take over the world 
3) People would diversify in other asset classes (gold, even litecoin), Basel 8 or any such accord would disallow banks to hold more than x% in high-risk assets like bitcoin
4) currency reforms did take place in history quite often. Governments could apply pressure to exchange bitcoin for a new cryptcurrency.

One of the more likely failure modes that could take out (or at least marginalize) BTC is death by hoarding. If too many people buy BTC just to keep them and watch the price rise, the market gets too tight, market manipulations become extremely profitable and the velocity drops.
For some time, the situation will be salvaged by using mBTC, then µBTC, then Satoshis, but then the thread of someone selling a few coins and bombing the market rises and rises. In the end, BTC users split into two factions:
- hoarders who just sit on their coins until they lose the wallet
- users that convert fiat into coins to buy at SR and merchants who accept coins and convert them to fiat as fast as they can.
This would marginalize BTC and never allow for a close BTC-economy

The most detailed discussion I have found is at  Key points:
- The repatriation rate of 50 tonnes per year is a continuation of arrangement organised in late 2012 (indicating Bundesbank requested this rate, not a limit set by the Fed).
- The logistics of transporting, testing and perhaps recasting the bars will be significant.
- Bundesbank is retaining a large portion (37%) of their Gold reserves with the Fed indicating a strong level of trust.
- Bundesbank says their Gold is allocated with identifiable bars and can be withdrawn at any time.
- Bundesbank refutes the stories of KWN that their metal is leased and not at the Fed.

What people seem to forget is that the ledger is fully public, so you will have a lot of explaining to do if you just "found 100 XBT on the street" or your "dog ate the wallet". Mixers won't help you: you get a paycheck of X XBT, you have to pay taxes on X.
The only thing the govt needs to implement is a register of official addresses and force companies to use only their registered address to send and receive XBT. Then they can do a pretty good matching for every company between what goes in and what flows out. And from there, work their way throught the block chain.
Company X claims they got an order worth 3000 XBT but Company Y paid them 4000? Tough shit, so easy to detect. They do an official contract over 3K and Y pays an additional 1K to a non-registered address? So Y's balance at the end of the month is off 1K, hard to explain.
Once XBT wins, it will even be back to barter trades to aquire drugs, no paying in XBT/LTC whatever.

paid for that week.  After the dividends are paid for the week you can then transfer your shares again.
Transfered shares will be processed FIFO as fast as possible.
**Transfers will only be accepted for 1 week through September 30, 2013.**
Warning:  Anyone, trying to commit fraud will have their transfer denied and shares confiscated.

I can see no flaw in his argument. In a world with negative inflation and therefore falling household income (after all, goods get cheaper every year and therefore the producers pay either less wages, rationalize like crazy and fire people or go bankrupt), you simply don't loan money for a longer period.
This would lead to negative interest rates, ie. the borrower gets back less BTC than he gave you - and I have a hard time imagining why anyone would borrow money. 
The discipline with which deflationary currencies whip governments would bite ordinary citizens and companies as well: you better save the money and after a frugal lifetime of saving you could buy a house. You cannot finance anything (at least no big-ticket items) via loans.
@_date: 2013-08-29 11:38:00


Does not make a lot of sense to me. Why would those countries invent something they cannot control to get rid of something they cannot control.
Also, a nation state would have tuned parameters to
- allow for some inflation (maybe 1%, if it was China maybe more like 5%)
- create some billions of BTC instead of 21m.

Well Bitcoin Conference was in May and the difficulty was around 10m back then, now it is around 50m. So even if he held only 10% of the May hashing power in his hand in form of one tray, you'd need 25 trays today to get 50%.

Still I don't get your problem. He uses a very optimistic scenario. If he factored in additional deflation by rising adoption (leading to higher BTC prices leading to lower income in terms of BTC) then his case would even be stronger.
His main point is: you take out a loan of 4260 BTC and with a 6% interest rate, you have to repay 255 BTC/year. However, with deflation and therefore lower income in BTC paid to you, two things can happen:
1) the % of interest of your income rises (his example)
2) the bank gets less and less BTC per year as interest, so negative interest
It does not matter if the interest rate is 2%  or 6%, in a deflationary setting, loans are a big problem.

In absolute terms or in relation to the size of the BTC economy? If the BTC economy has over the same period increased 100% (from fiat flowing in), an increase in the value exchanged by 50% means people are hoarding and some kind of deflationary spiral is at work.
BTC is NOT a mature economy but growing a lot, so the increase in spending is most likely due to the influx of fiat (call it imported inflation, if you like)
