If they're on Coinbase, they're *relatively* secure. Just make sure you lock down your Coinbase account (good password, and two factor authentication). If you want to hold onto them for longer (without trading them around for different currencies) look at something like a paper wallet or a Ledger Nano S. Generally the advice is to only keep coins on Coinbase (or any exchange) if you plan on actually trading them.

Do you know which tip bot it was?

Depends where you live. It's illegal in Washington.

A number attributed to a card that is only good for a single use. That way if that payment system is compromised, they only get the one time use number which can not be used again.

When registering an email with a website, you can sometimes do something like:
So, for example, say your "normal" email is themagicpickle You want to register on reddit so you could put in the email as themagicpickle+reddit Then on mtgox as themagicpickle+mtgox
The "+xyz" suffix is a valid tag for emails. It's just that some website's form validation excludes the "+" symbol from their validation.

I know you can't. I'm assuming they fix the problem that their having right now and re-enable withdrawals.

There's likely a good number of people that were trying/planning to sell prior to Gox stopping withdrawals. When they reopen, people will be eager to cash out from Gox and there will be a drop. Then you'll have the people that see the drop panic and they'll sell off as well. And then the value really goes plop.

This is amazingly awesome.

And the Dot-Com bubble lasted roughly 4 years.
A bubble doesn't have to be weeks or months. It can (obviously) last years and when it crashes it can end companies and change the market. As Wikipedia mentions, after the NASDAQ peaked in early 2000 [it dropped 78%]( over the next 30 months. After that crash it took nearly 15 years to get back to that same point.
Hell, look at the lead-up of the Dot-Com bubble...a new technology begins to get popular so investors flock to practically any company that had anything to do with it. People quit their jobs to day trade. Wikipedia even says:


Sound familiar?

True. But that's not *quite* as quick and convenient as something like Coinbase (when it's working).

Sure wish that there was another option for purchasing with fiat currency here in Washington. Coinbase has been the only one that I've found.

I feel like mBTC should be shown as well as BTC, at least for a while (and perhaps in a different font size at first). I don't like the idea of a sudden switch:
* People are used to seeing BTC
* There are most likely people who wont understand what "milli" actually stands for. Showing both at the same time will help with that
* Reduces the chance that people mistakenly view it as a crash or a problem with the exchange. Never underestimate the ignorance of some people.

$78 now.

I did this yesterday and it was a breeze. But now I'm just waiting for everything to settle a little bit.
It's funny how I was thinking how inconvient it was to have to go to the bank to do a deposit, but then I remembered that's how deposits always used to be (before direct deposits, ATM, and heck even cell phones in some cases).
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:22:29
I plan to. I just want to make sure I don't do something that results in me losing the wallet (even though I've made a backup). Hence the question.

There were people who freaked out when it was a high around $200 and crashed down to ~$50. Now look at where it is. Don't sell.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:43:01
Ya, so far it's more of a small adjustment back to before it spiked to the 800-900 range. I do think it has a high potential to drop though. There's probably a lot of people who are eyeing it closely now to see if it "crashes" and will probably sell quickly if it gives an indication that it *could* crash (which then it would).
