Only need around 200 BTC to pay off mortgage, but what the hey. heh.

Yep, that would be it... as you can see, they rarely sign on, don't bother PMing them.

I'm really not, I wouldn't touch Reddit with a ten-foot pole if I was actually staff. They do have a legit account (agora_voice) if you're curious, but anyway...
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:11:00
Loaded questions.  ;-Þ
oh wait, you're some sort of anti-bitcoin troll. meh.

Some markets not mentioned in that article did neither -- Black Market Reloaded and TMP both did an orderly shut down and gave users a month or so to remove their coins. I'd like to think they realize it makes more financial sense over the long-term to have a continuous revenue.


Buyers shouldn't use dark markets as personal storage wallets. Only those buyers who did so lost money. Vendors lost coins, sure... at least those who used escrow, which is why a lot of them are turning to "finalize early"-only listings.


They're associated with BitcoinFog which has been operating unimpeded for at least 4 years. People have been calling "scam" on Agora now for its entire history. I guess it's nice to only have to be right once. They don't appear to have made the [in retrospect] laughable mistakes that Ross did, and even with those mistakes, it took the gov't over 2 years to find him.
You also assume they're located in the U.S. or some extraditable country. They could be located in Russia, Morocco, or any other number of countries which will give the U.S. the middle finger when it comes to server search warrants and whatnot. There are carding forums operated by Russians which have existed in continuous fashion for over a decade at this point.

No, the more uses for BTC, the better.  ;)

1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 mikes
As in both "microbitcoin" and possibly "Mike Hearn". heh.

Someone actually asked the man himself [that very question yesterday](Karpeles (MagicalTux) actually responded, to his credit.

Just who you want on a trial involving Tor, Bitcoins, encryption, and other high technology.  :-p
Even the libertarian notion that drugs should be legal doesn't exactly play well with the senior citizen crowd.
Good grief. Sad to say, but Ross is done for.

Not getting involved in this, but I'm not an "admin" nor am I affiliated with any Agora staff. I'm just the subreddit moderator, a random person. The subreddit sidebar specifically says that the moderators have no affiliation with Agora staff. This isn't some crafty disclaimer for legal purposes, I really do not work for them. That's why I [can] post frequently. Agora staff doesn't talk to me, doesn't pay me a salary, etc.
The Evolution guy is part of their staff, though... I don't know the exact relationship though.
Anyway, carry on...  :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:59:44
Forget their typo... by my watch, it's currently 01:01 GMT (an hour past their deadline), ~~and the site is still D.O.A.~~
EDIT: back up 10 minutes later. Very crafty... :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:23:42
meh, anyone can tell I'm not part of the Agora staff because I post more on clearnet in a day than they have in the entire site's existence.
The actual Agora admins' Reddit username is "agora_voice" ... but LE already knows that.

No, I'm just a random moderator.
I have no affiliation with Agora staff/admins, and I generally just give advice to people or answer questions. Freedom of speech. Of course, like you, I would never use the market myself...  :-D

Am I still one of the first thousand comments? Hmm...
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:37:07
I doubt it. In all seriousness, I think most, if not all, of bitcoin's meteoric rise from $125 to $1200 was caused by fraudulent trading on Mt. Gox by you-know-who.
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:23:48
Nope, sorry... ["Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity"](
Alright, you think the feds planted his diary on his laptop? Did they also plant the 144,000 bitcoins on his computer? Or the posts from 2011 advertising the market? *Did they plant thoughts in his head that forced him to tell his friend and ex-girlfriend that he started Silk Road?*
Why frame *Ross Ulbricht* of all people, a random nobody before any of this occurred?
I know this is tinfoil/anti-government land here, but the guy is DPR. Deal with it. We can argue about his 4th amendment rights, how the FBI found the server in Iceland, and why he didn't admit ownership of that server (which would force the feds to confess that the found the server, possibly illegally)... but the way his defense played out, he's guilty as all hell.
EDIT: someone gave gold to the loony conspiracy theorist parent post? Wow. :*twirls finger while pointing at head*:

And speaking of that... and its associated onion site has been accepting Bitcoin for 15 months, has done an... ahem... "indeterminate" number of BTC sales. But it's done $0.00 USD sales in the same time period. Please someone make a cash purchase!  ;-)
Yeah, this was a cheap plug, I couldn't resist.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:31:39
This is getting off-topic from Ross, but my point was that even responsible drug use (e.g., "I mellow out once a week with some Vicodin") won't looked at very highly even by younger people, despite the fact that:
- dysfunctional addicts represent a small minority of drug users. The majority who manage use responsibly, while paying the bills &amp; working, *aren't* noticed at all.
- alcohol is responsible for more addiction and death than opiates or anything else, yet few people are taken aback by someone who likes a few beers.
You can't take the libertarian stance of "People should be free to put whatever they want in their bodies", and then add a caveat of ... "oh wait, except Heroin, except Vicodin, except [untested psychedelic], etc."
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:47:04
I think people here, where the demographic is mostly under 35, wildly *overestimate* the chances of nullification.
I get the support for Ross, but the government has a pretty-damned airtight case against him. Not because the feds are geniuses, but because Ross royally screwed up in numerous ways. A diary? Private keys and passwords on the very computer you're trying to keep secret? Using your real name/email to advertise the site?
The guy simply had no idea how to operate as a criminal, especially if the hammer ever dropped on him. You don't "recruit helpers". You don't give "hints and half-truths" to friends and girlfriends, etc etc. He may have been unprepared for how big SR eventually became, but he was completely out of his depth as an admin.

Don't waste your time... I just tried brute-forcing *all* 1,536 combinations (3 * 2^9 ) of the 5 mBTC wallet; none of the would-be private keys are even valid (bad checksum), let alone contain coins.
And that was the one with the fewest combinations; no doubt OP misidentified other letters as well.

I'm doing some generalizing here, but most Baby Boomers have turned into Grade-A hypocrites. They used drugs back in the day, but if they ever found out their kids were using even mild stuff, they'd pitch a fit. "Do as I say, not as I did."
In fact, IMO most people *of all ages* tend to be fairly hypocritical about drug use. Even younger folks: if your use overlaps their own, they're cool with it -- especially marijuana and alcohol (yes, that's a drug!). But watch how quickly their carefree attitude cools if you tell them you enjoy LSD. Or Vicodin. You get the idea.
If Ross were on trial for selling bulk weed or something, I might see a nullifier coming into play, but this trial is something on an entirely different level. Unless the entire jury is composed of former SR1 users in their 20's, he's done. Like it or not.
