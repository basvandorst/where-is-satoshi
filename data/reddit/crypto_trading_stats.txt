The first one is that the value of the cryptocurrency should be  pegged to one or more fiat currencies. This potentially signals that  the legislators have decided to allow salary payments to be carried out  with stable coins entirely."

I bought BTC in 2017 when the price was $3,500. Then I thought if I should sell in 2018 when the price was $17,000, but I was still holding it all when the price went back to $3,500 this year :D
That's why I built a simple tool, to help me decide should I buy, sell, HODL, or go on vacation with my girlfriend [
Just some data from the exchanges, buy and sell signals based on daily price movements, latest dips and  bounces from 24/48 hours high &amp; low, buy and sell walls, and all the  basic price %-changes 1h / 1d / 1w / 1mo. There are also some instructions on how I use that tool. Let me know if you find it useful or if it's a total waste of time.
