Ah so once a priority has reached a algorithm result of 57,600,000 , it is considered high priority and will generally be accepted at the begining of blocks regardless :). Weither from the amount of bitcoins, transaction size or age, or a combination of any, a transaction can become high priority.
This answers my question! Thanks :D
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:54:19
Does anyone know where I can find information of Bitcoin priority? How do miners see priority? What is the algorith? And at what output of that algorith is a threashold for it to say “accept”?
priority is a balance between fee and age. That is all I know. But surely there is a line graph illustrating age over fee?

I hit a new problem. My printer isn’t accurate enough to print these tiny private key QR codes. I absolutely need to convert the QR code (of the priv key) to be just the WIP format. Does anyone know how to write text on canvas?

I like your explanations. See my reply below under Darft if you can. I couldn’t reply to all of you :P.
Exciting to hear about pruned nodes! I run a node as well (daytime node) because I can. But the HDD space is killer; I can’t afford to be a full unpruned node. However it sounds like unpruned nodes are still critical and the world switching to pruned could make starting nodes a slower process.

I am not going to reuse an address however. So me testing it would be fine and dandy, but if I messed up the next time for the ‘actual usage’ I could be screwed.
All my questions still stand. I understand that WIP format has error checking; similar to parity bits. What I want to know is does every possible number (to the max integer supported) for private keys have a corresponding public key? Is there a minimum number?
PS I did mean public key. I edited my post. Typo.

Love it. Makes total sense (for this part). Did I get my sequence right though?
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:17:16
elaborate :P
Im not following

I feel like I am missing one aspect. 
Originally, when I said ‘heavy lifting’ I meant: The node seems to have the important job while mining simply guesses the correct number (the fact the difficulty is so high just so happens makes running a miner hard. (Back when difficulty was 1, Im sure running a node was more heavy lifting computationally than mining ) )
Is the number that the miner is trying to calculate related to the current block of transactions [that is being worked on]? I didn’t know that miners were also full nodes (or that miners in pools have one node); so I’m guessing that when a miner guesses the correct number, it publishes it’s own current block (it's node) as the next completed block? If this is true, let me pose this:
Why not have a rogue miner simply guess the right number, claim the block reward, but not do the node work (the heavy lifting!) Lets say this rogue miner didnt take in any unconfirmed transactions! It guessed the right number, gets the reward and can publish it’s rogue block (of possibly an attack) as correct; after all it was the winner!

I’m having a hard time explaining the part of bitcoin I have confusion about; so forgive me.
* Miners hash a function with an input that is a output of the previous (closed &amp; finished) block
* Miner finds hash with x leading zeros (wins reward)
* Miner propogates his findings (and his ledger of his block that hes been collecting transactions and fees to) to other nodes
* Othe Miners then do PoW to verify the winning miner’s hash function (as the inputs relies on previous blocks and any changes would invalidate the result of the hash)
Even if I didn’t get all this correct, my original question that I started with (to clarify things) was all around the idea of why even do that Proof of Work. It makes sense, to strengthen the network and your money. I posed this because I originally saw it as ‘time doing PoW is time wasted that could be hashing’. But it makes sense.

~~Not a good choice because I don’t want the designs the provide.~~ Nothing more than the key + QR code :\
I thought about bitaddress.org as a option too but I cant find where to input my own keys
UPDATE: This can work, but I would like to have multiple keys per page. To maximize efficiency. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:33:19
Ive seen that video :D.
Thats not the part of the process im concerned with. No matter what I put in the offline key generator, because all the generator is doing is math, it will spit out a result. Are there improper ranges of keys that wont work? They say there are 2^160 addresses…. so…. can you start with 1, then 2, 3, 4… all the way to 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 ? (ofc converting decimal to WIF format).
Is every. single. decimal. used to generate a priv/pub key pair working? Could one actually use “1”, the first number, generated into a public key and sent money to it? And retreive the money? OFC this is unmountably unsecure :D
My questions are more about the technical limitations imposed upon the wallet software/blockchain and less on the generating.
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:56:03
Hmm. So address reuse could be compromised then. This is the same guy that made bitaddress?
I like what the script does however, it generates a bunch of keys on a compact sheet of sticker paper. Okay so what about modifying the script so that the random seed is based off of manual input? Something like me rolling some hexidecimal dice? Or is it the whole random engine even with a truely random seed just bad?
@_date: 2015-05-11 22:13:50
But that is how blocks are completed! Brilliant!
100 blocks?! Isn’t the absolute longest chain orphaned 31 blocks (11/12/13 chainfork)? and that was caused by mining version discrepencies. I think the longest consecutive winning pool only got 6 blocks in a row. So seeing 100 is so drastically high. No way I could see 99 blocks orphaned. ….But I guess thats only ~16 hours anyways :\
@_date: 2015-05-09 01:47:12
I was able to update the PRNG :D
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:54:12
I love you :D
This answers a lot of my questions! No matter if I overroll or underroll my dice, I cannot have a bad address. According to the wiki, every address (to the obscene max height) is usable! :D. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 00:07:11
Okay thanks again! If you ever get time let me know. Ill throw you some bits :P. I will probably still be struggling XD. 
My idea is to put about $1 on each coin, give them out to friends and as tips at sushi/coffee places. I simply want people to talk about bitcoin by giving away bitcoin. I will try to change the code but I don’t think for a dollar it’s too dangerous. (probably wont be giving out the public keys; thats what I was thinking)

I know Darft wants to kill me for saying that nodes are heavy lifting. But these ASIC chips are hardware based hash functions :P. A lot of horsepower but man… nodes are under appreciated and don’t get a lot of rewards :P. I also thought that the nodes were doing some Proof of Work or all of it. Part of where my confusion lied. 
I visualize ASIC chips as so efficient that they don’t do a lot of work. It’s so efficient that it can do a quadrillion hashes a second. While a my processor on my computer can only do 83,000 MIPS (has to use multiple instructions sent to the ALU to perform a simple task (while the ASIC only does one task: SHA256)) and constantly reads/writes from the HDD. I thought about this inversely. But never mind that.
I totally forgot about transaction fees! That makes complete sense that it is more profitable to include them. When do miners get the transaction fees? Only the miner that wins the block reward gets the transaction fees right?
@_date: 2015-07-18 16:17:52
Huh I noticed that :O. Lucky me! XD
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:53:30
Snagging one. Thanks for the share! :D
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:59:53
Best answer so far! It will sit unconfirmed forever! This makes the most sense :D. Also read up on Child pays for parent here; great read: 
@_date: 2015-07-18 03:32:16
Why is that?
@_date: 2015-07-18 04:53:25
Made a graph using Wolfram Alpha to illustrate the priority calculation. It was fun making it :P
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:00:58
This helps a lot and makes a lot of sense. Only thing I have a question about:


How do I reuse the same session keypair? Before 5 minutes ago, I didn’t even know this was a part of the system. Lets assume my bitcoin wallet does not have a compromised PRNG. Is there any particular action I need to be careful about to avoid reusing the session keypairs?
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:11:43
Great. So keeping up to date on the official Bitcoin-QT wallet (stable not nightly builds or anything) would most probably be my safest bet. This has been very informative! Thanks Greatwolf!
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:35:19
How can I be sure of security? Are there any limitations I can set to the API Plaid that you use? ie: limit how much money a ‘untrusted app’ using Plaid can withdraw automatically?
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:41:50
Well since everything is in a public ledger, lets assume everyone (anyone) has the right tools. They don’t need to know who I am to attack me :S
I would really like to not only print a pay-here QR sign, but it would be nice to make apparel with QRs on it as well :\. So far it sounds like an unwise idea
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:26:25
My alerts didnt go through on Reditr. 7 days?! :O
Wow it is cool that the case is publicly available on the internet! However pecathor now brings up a really good point :P. Maybe I will make a protective shell instead and use the 3D file provided for dimensions ^_^
