Indeed. HODL!

Would he consider shorting Bitcoin futures, since he's been critical of it as of late?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:13:31
Good point. Me too as well. I didn't include that here, but I probably should have. Thought I was investing into a "mutual fund" for crypto - years ago - went way up and then to the bottom. And the owner went to jail, if I recall. lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:14:33
So it's completely offchain at that point?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:13:59
You're not alone. But these crappy things teach us painful lessons. Sorry, man.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:20:52
Ok, thanks. And depending on how much you move in the channel is what determines the back and forth cap? Or is it just for one way and you have to make a new channel each time?

@_date: 2017-12-28 18:38:54
Would you say it's worth it so far? 
@_date: 2014-12-28 16:27:14
For US Tax Guidance, yes. Or if you spend to purchase something, you have to.See this:
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:36:00
Yes, that is closer to what would help, but still, if you got in early, you have to pay a ton of taxes with all the gains you've made so far, even with the price barely over $300.
@_date: 2014-12-28 16:01:03
Lol. Per Option B, you're probably right, but isn't that the inevitable outcome?? Perhaps, that is the larger point. 
Maybe I've gotten all the feedback I'm looking for. The answers I've received lead me to believe so far that it just is the way it is. Which sort of sucks. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:15:20
That's true. In fact, I'm a big fan of Invictus and what they're doing. But Keyhotee won't interfact with other sites and services will it? If so, that's something I wasn't aware of (but that'd be okay). 
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:30:49
Well they or someone else should, in the case of US consumers. Or else adoption in the US will be very drawn out. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:44:01
BitPay is for merchants. I'm referring to using it as a consumer to, say, buy a new graphics card from Newegg, etc.
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:27:31
That's fantastic news. Thank you for this. I wish I could upvote you twice. However, what are your retention policies? Do you store all of the data for the individual users and their expenses? Or do you pull it all from other sources and present for that particular user and their expenses/requests? 
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:49:17
Which is incorrect? Because if this statement in untrue, please correct us: "The $600 threshold refers only to the requirement for filing a Form 1099."

@_date: 2014-12-28 16:16:03
Excellent points. That's why I don't spend it, actually, because I'm confident it is going to be worth much more than it is today. 
And some people/businesses will most definitely be busted for tax evasion. It is coming. And it will wake up the community.
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:38:40
No offense, but your response makes me think haven't spent much time dealing with the IRS. If you truly understand what they can and will do, you wouldn't say what you just said. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 23:05:05
Until the next spike and then the adoption and use crowd moves into the holding bitcoin camp because they won't want to deal with the tax implications of bitcoin as currency in the US.
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:56:40
Interesting. That's what I thought too, but I'm not sure though, because in my reading I didn't see where it clearly pointed that out. I'm going to recheck now. Thanks for this point. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:40:48
Okay, now we are getting somewhere. No, I am not. I pay my taxes. But I pay them with USD which are treated as currency regardless if their global value compared to other assets and currencies rises or falls. BTC is treated as property and not currency to the IRS. Which makes it burdensome to those who attempt to use it as an actual currency. That's my point. 
I want the tax guidance to change to reflect how BTC is intended to be used = currency. It's not right now. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:33:22
But that won't work with FIFO. I first bought in early 2013 when it was sub $100. It doesn't matter what I buy now, since the first BTC I spend will have to be treated as FIFO and therefore = major tax headache.
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:42:42
That's an interesting point. But I mostly use Amazon, which is US-Based, and they calculate taxes for you. 
And, to your comment about "unless your buying and selling huge amounts..." is incorrect. If you buy a cup of coffee for $5 with BTC you bought at $10 and is now $100, you have some reporting and calculating to do. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:50:29
Ok, that is a fair point. And perhaps you are right. That's why they created the guidance. But the fact remains: I haven't spent any of my BTC because I don't have time to deal with the burden of dealing with the taxes of every...single...transaction I make. 
I should have started this post with, "Show of hands, who uses BTC for some or all of your previously USD-only purchases?" And then the ones that say they do ask them how they deal with their tax liability. Because that's where I'm at. I want to use BTC for all my transactions because it's safer, faster, cheaper, but it's just too much work.
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:46:59
Yes, exactly. Thank you. That's where I've come to. I share the same thoughts. 
It either needs to:
A. Be so ingrained with wallets that you see the net/net clearly and without any confusion or burden
B. Be treated like USD, aka a currency, in the eyes of the IRS
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:17:03
When you say crypto, you're referring to interacting with any crypto currency, right? 
Because part of what I'm talking about is authentication with any site. My preference is BTC right now, because it's just my biggest passion at the moment.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:41:22
If so, then that's huge. I'm going to have to dig a little deeper into it - or just contact them directly to find out - but that'd be very helpful if that's the case. 
Using the power inherent in the Blockchain to bolster internet/web security would be great. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:12:41
The IRS can go back at least 7 years, I believe. And that applies to anything related to taxes. So yes. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:47:48
Yes, I believe so. The transaction is either a capital gain or capital loss. If it's a capital gain, you have to pay taxes on it. If it's a capital loss, you don't have to pay on it, obviously, and you can take a loss on your taxes when you file the next year. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:46:09
Fair enough, but when the IRS mails you a bill for thousands of dollars 4 years after the fact, you might sing a different tune. This has happened to me before over a very easy oversight. They were pleasant to deal with, but make no mistake, they were getting their money. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:55:40
That's a good point. Which is why I'd want to know if it was possible programmatically or not. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:58:44
Read this: 
It's from a tax attorney. The $600 is not related to day-to-day consumer purchases, but rather purchases made using BTC as a business.
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:36:55
Which part? 
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:35:08
I'm not missing the point. I'm speaking for me and my family. We are not going to be spending it in the US until the tax guidance changes or until someone changes my mind and shows me a easier way to use it without dealing with the tax headache.
My comment above is strictly confined to US involvement with BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-28 16:04:58
Well, you should report a loss on your taxes if you take a loss, because that will benefit you come tax time. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:06:04
That is incorrect. See the advice from the tax attorney found in the link below. 


@_date: 2014-12-28 18:07:19
This is my conclusion as well. To really use it as I want to use it - and how it's intended to be used - is nearly impossible in its current state. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:29:34
You're probably right. The question is how long. Adoption might have inertia and grow even faster (globally) than anyone thinks once all the pieces are in place. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:02:49
I think so. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:49:51
Well, that's pretty cool. And I understand it has tremendous upside for non-US citizens living in other countries (like Argentina, etc.). I'm just more looking through the lens of a US Citizen who uses USD for everything and would like to use BTC for some or all their expenses. The burden is annoying and makes it not worthwhile for me. I am just curious if others feel the same way. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:58:43
Okay, cool. Although I was sort of hoping that I was wrong. lol. The $600 limit would have been pretty cool if true. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:15:15
Ah, good point. I'm not sure. But personally, when messing with the IRS, I err on the side of caution. Unless I have a tax lawyer (or two) making sure I'm following the law. I'm not sure though about this. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:07:45
This is very impressive. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:14:19
I say within a year, we'll see 10%-20% completely vanish due to regulation / SEC clampdown and new BTC upgrades.
