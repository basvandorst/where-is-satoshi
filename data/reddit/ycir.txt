It differs dependent upon money initially invested with coinbase, verification levels, bank account, and LinkedIn profile. It they see you trying to transfer a large amount frequently, have everything verified, review your bank account, and hold a decent paying job - they will let you raise your limits very easily.
I’ve had mine raised twice, but it takes awhile for the review process now since so many people have joined the space.

Why is everyone acting like this affects them? The IRS is requesting records of around 14k customers from 2013-2015. Do you guys realize how insignificant that number is vs the total # of CB users? I’m sure *eventually* it’ll continue to get worse as the future unfolds if the value keeps soaring, but for now, people do have options. You can either wait to be corrected by them or just initially file the proper gains.

This — same exact thing happened from 8k to 11.5k back down to 8.8k .. now this massive bull run again from 11.5k to 14.5k... I’m trying to time the top.... but every time I try to do that I regret it lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:24:02
I’m not sure if it’s still happening? Price dropped like a rock from $1.2k to $300? Lol ... usually not a good sign and leads me to believe it was insider trading and might not go through just like last time.... entire dev team is a pure scam

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:07:14
This is *fair* however, since the spike $19kish almost two weeks ago, there’s been little movement (again *%* wise) vs virtually all other alts which have all seen 100-500% increases :/

My discussion is purely against % wise vs alts. And yes, it has remained stagnant in the last two weeks (which is considered longer than usual) vs virtually all alt coins.
I’m simply asking for discussion and why the pure speculation on alts recently vs the stagnant*ish* again... take in the *ISH* part...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:05
Yes I totally understand this, but the general public only *knows* about bitcoin, they could care less about anything else. Anytime I talk with *anyone* it’s always about bitcoin, not what xyz coin is doing — (**currently**)

How do you figure? BTC reached ~7800 a few day ago and now it's down to ~5800. Obviously we could go off the past, but this is pretty low for the month considering where we were at a few days / weeks ago.

I’m so lost. I have one electrum wallet. I sent my BTC from GDAX to electrum. I still don’t see an unconfirmed status in electrum.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:41:51
Doesn’t the DAA just adjust the difficulty to make both coins at a split equal profit?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:58:43
So you’re fee was almost 30% of what you sent?

Didn’t it already occur at 495886
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:35:41
I did, but when I did this before (twice) my wallet showed an unconfirmed status in my wallet with the transaction. Now I don’t even see that and it’s been an hour. I know there’s a back log... but I’m nervous :(

This still doesn’t make sense

Is it actually trash? People say that but don’t understand the fundamentals
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:00:48
That’s what I thought as well... if DAA is comparable to BTC, why mine something for ~1500 vs btc at ~6000?

Can you even buyed something with $150 nowadays?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:47:21
I'd be forked if that were the case because I didn't get any forked BCH :/
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:08:20
thx 4 the lol tn
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:55:26
I’m confused. Isn’t the DAA just making it the same difficulty as BTC? Why would it make sense to mine a coin valued at ~1200 vs btc at ~6500? (Given the same difficulty due to the new HF / DAA)
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:00:42
They didn’t say whether or not it will be activated... it’s dependent upon if the miners go thru with it
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:50:31
I don’t think you will live long anyways inhaling car fumes
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:29:25
That’s not how this works lol
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:08:25
Identical situation - $55k is a great buy in to make decent money (or lose) with a 20k cushion if btc takes another dip. If it starts to dip, stagger your buy-ins with the 20k by 150-250 (consecutively - i.e., .25 btc @ 6350, $6150, 5950, etc) below the current market, hit the gym, get dinner, get sleep. Open your portfolio a day / two days later
Try to deviate from alts as much as possible unless you do exponential research. Ethereum has been having a decent run the past few weeks to make ~$2500 depending on how you play your cards. It has consistently tipped to ~285-290 and rebounds to ~300-305 petty easily.

@_date: 2017-11-13 18:37:10
If it’s 50/50 that’ll make the DAA the same, meaning, it’ll still be more profitable to mine btc @ ~$6400 vs BCH @ ~$1400... this is my understanding and I don’t know if it’s correct 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:23:19
Did you check your receive address on blockchain explorer? I have zero transactions showing so I don’t know :( this is the second time I’ve done this I’m not confident in myself doing this crap yet. I don’t think it’ll hit in time :(
GDAX pays the fee I read / heard somewhere
It still doesn’t say unconfirmed though
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:18:08
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:11:33
Honestly, you shouldn’t FOMO. It’s at an ATH and it’s hard not to give in, especially if it hits $8750-$9500. Once it establishes these prices, you’ll see a dip. It’s best to wait for these dips to occur because the price *usually*... sorry, **always** seems to recover. It’s pretty crazy. 
E.g., price hit ~$7800 and people were fomoing, bought high $7’s and price ranked to mid $5’s and many sold. This is the time where you want to be liquid and buy the dip staggering your buy-ins
This is why I profit take at each margin BTC reaches in case it takes a concurrent dip. I do plan to cash out entirely soon (mid 9’s (if it reaches this price point)) and plan to wait for a dip. If it doesn’t dip at $9500ish and moons to $12000 and reaches a new ATH but then dips back to $8500-$9500, that’s the time to buy even though you missed out on selling the top, which is nearly impossible to time.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:41:37

@_date: 2017-11-11 13:46:38
I own 100% btc, but it’s frustrating when people call bch trash when they don’t actually know the fundamentals behind something. Just because it forked off the original chain does not inherently mean it’s a bad coin.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:26:54
Yeah that’s if you take profits 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:08:25
At the end of the day, $4000 isn’t much and won’t make someone commit suicide. In high school, sure it may seem like a lot, same for college. Not many people have a $4000 “cushion”. If you don’t need the $4000 and have it just sitting around, do something with it. Whether it’s investing in bitcoin, commodities, tangible assets, etc... try to find a stream of revenue that you like / can tolerate
Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere and neither is crypto. He’ll also accumulate whatever free coins come along the way.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:04:37
Because it rose over 50% in a day and btc didn’t? Lol that’s most likely your main argument

Honestly I get maybe you don’t have much, but seriously what’s the point putting in $50 into BTC? It’ll need to rise like $1k for you to make what? $10? Why don’t you put your money into something else (cheaper coins, i.e., research) and come back to btc when you’ve made $
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:48:46
That’s one month too long :(
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:59:21
Won’t the difficulty to mine be the same for both chains after the DAA / HF? Why would a miner chose to mine a ~1200 coin vs btc at ~6500? That’s a missed profit of ~5300?

CME is right around the corner, I’ll wait it out until that announcement. Price will most likely jump anywhere from $500-$1,500 at whatever price point it sits at before the announcement. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:41:10
How do we know that even when the difficulty adjustment takes place that bch still won’t be more profitable to mine?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:11:27
I’m just hoping my coins transfer to my wallet in time :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:23:09
If it crashes to 90% and bch becomes the new "btc" then I think crypto as a whole will lose a lot of credibility to investors / general adoption

I guess it could always be worse, depends on how much you are gambling with your savings. Fully knowing I was ready to lose it all, but I wanted more fiat to buy the dip when it stops bleeding which is honestly the only reason I sold because I'm not putting anymore money into this space than I have already allocated :/

I thought placing a limit buy/sell is free and placing a market buy renders a fee involved? It's kind of the same way as coinbase... if you buy via coinbase you are paying "market" which is why there is a fee involved because it instantly gets taken vs setting a limit which is why there isn't a fee?

Why the hell would you expect a bank teller to know anything valuable anyways? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:01:18
IMO - although it rose a bit, it'll continue to tank until the other exchanges announce their closure. If it makes you feel any better, I bought LTC at its (almost) ATH at $92 - bit the bullet and sold at $54. Lost 5k. I will reinvest when everything cools off
Pays to play, right now is not a time to risk anything. 
I feel bad for ethereum specifically because they were suppose to announce big news this month. I'm hoping they delay it due to all this speculation.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:36:56
You have to hold the core wallet? Or can you put the coins in an electrum wallet and still get the forked coins?

@_date: 2017-09-12 05:06:46
The point is - I think he's possibly better off investing $500 (hypothetical) into another coin that has potential to double easier than BTC to go from 4k to 8k, just my personal opinion
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:38:55
Would like to see this as well, but very unlikely with how volatile this shit is :(
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:56:35
Bought LTC at $92, sold at $54. I feel your pain, lost 5k if that makes you feel better. I sold because I plan on buying back cheaper and learning a hard lesson.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:26:09
I'm roughly the same boat, having a full time job helps lol. I'll just back in after I lick the wounds, was tough to sell. I don't know how much further it'll go or when it'll everything will cool off. 
I anticipate that it'll continue to keep a downward trend at least until the weekend is over.

Wow thanks for the insight - as if I didn't know when I pushed the sell button. It'll take a lot for this to recover and I've been sitting three weeks looking at continually loses. I rather have pulled out now and have fiat immediately available for when it bottoms out
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:33:40
I would've been more shooketh from 32 to 2 lol
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:19:09
Excuse me?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:46:10
Or you could make off a few grand riding the small waves
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:36:47
Pictures would help! :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:05:30
I checked my electrum receive address on blockchain info and it currently say 0 transactions. I made two transactions within the last hour and nothing and 0 confirmations.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:52:41
Will 100% dip before the weekend doesn't everyone know this already lol
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:00:26
Wow! Stating what I already said - amazing!
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:30:11
What was BTC-E used for? (Sorry for lack of knowledge)
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:09:31
Okay - thanks for the help! I see it now as well on blockchain info.
So I’m free to send my BTC now I assume
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:35:58
Thanks! Where does it try to trade? In the US or China?
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:12:41
Not if you do a limit sell (and limit buy)
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:05:16
I agree - price will go below 4k unfortunately for a short period of time. Good point to buy more though
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:02:00
Held for almost a month and saw my money kept declining. Decided to sell at a loss and day trade the waves until all this crap with China / 2x passes. Nothing is certain until after Nov 1, which is when all the shit news will finally clear and less FUD. 
Only until then will I be all in again when it hits low points again. I learned my lesson :-)
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:00:54
Why would it dip?
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:55:15
Don’t know why you’re posting here and haven’t already gone to see if it’s still there. It’s been almost 3 years, you’ll probably spend just as much time trying to find it as it’s been sitting there.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:11:18
It was almost at $6k again and now hovering around $5.7m after recovering a bit. Just wondering if it’s investors taking profit or some daily news.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:45:09
What do you mean split it?
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:32:08
This isn’t possible. BTG isn’t readily available to the public to even have BTG in a wallet. The developers are premining coins prior to releasing it to the public 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:12:41
Not if you do a limit sell (and limit buy)
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:46:53
I lost 6k, are you better or worse?
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:34:36
Think market will tank again selling off their coins?
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:56:14
Sadly, there won't be a surge right now because of people anticipating Chinese news, less because of the CEO guy. However, did read something that bitcoin exchanges without licenses will be banned, not bitcoin itself. Not sure why everyone is freaking out, unless it's the latter
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:30:26
Well your btc for cash &gt; avoid taxes 
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:56:37
This is literally what I’ve been doing for the last 4-5 days... I lost 6k hodling... but made 1k day trading
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:53:09
Really could've used this earlier today
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:13:14
He won’t get any BTG keeping it in coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:34:13
Actually electrum won’t even download to my computer. I’m trying to accept the terms of service and put my email, but nothing generates after this point
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:39:03
Maybe you should include the other most recent decline? (Mid August ~4400 --&gt; ~3650)
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:07:22
If you're trading GDAX, why are you paying fees?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:46:29
Bitcoin.org? **
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:53:02
You high?
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:37:21
Yeah just text me we can cry together bud
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:03:14
10/10 would recommend
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:52:15
How much did you transfer? I only did .003 btc, is this not enough for miners to mine it? I don’t think I was charged a fee? Is this why it hasn’t transferred?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:22:28
50% retrace into what? Lol you’re saying it’ll drop back down to $2700?
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:38:54
This guy fucks
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:51:47
Nothing like some good ole random redditor as a valuable source of info!
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:52:36
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:58:50
Hey thanks for your response. I was finally able to do it last night after multiple attempts on different PCs. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:56:35
Bought LTC at $92, sold at $54. I feel your pain, lost 5k if that makes you feel better. I sold because I plan on buying back cheaper and learning a hard lesson.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:10:52
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:56:28
2 weeks
@_date: 2017-09-12 05:33:50
Huh? You'd just place a sell order for x amount and watch the money pile up as people buy your coins, not really much to it
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:17:27
Well that one was sent from GDAX so I don’t think I paid a fee. I also did .002 from GDAX which I haven’t received to another address.
I received my .0055 to my other address as well, (coinbase attached a $1.77 fee).
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:40:06
Wow seriously? I should’ve transferred this shit awhile ago
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:07:22
If you're trading GDAX, why are you paying fees?
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:18:13
You’ll miss it every time you try to time it
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:33:40
I would've been more shooketh from 32 to 2 lol
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:32:18
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:12:28
I don’t think it costs anything to send from GDAX to electrum. I thought there was only a fee from the wallet to an exchange?
Also - how do I look up the transaction ID via GDAX?
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:57:45
You act like coinbase is the sole reason, as if other exchanges aren’t taking an identical stance
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:30:22
If I leave it in my electrum wallet, will I receive BTG?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:36:33
As opposed to just stating the real story?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:14:54
This doesn’t make sense. Nobody has BTG yet? Aren’t they premining $200kish prior to going public?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:26:50
Says a redditor for two days lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:17:25
I guess it could always be worse, depends on how much you are gambling with your savings. Fully knowing I was ready to lose it all, but I wanted more fiat to buy the dip when it stops bleeding which is honestly the only reason I sold because I'm not putting anymore money into this space than I have already allocated :/
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:20:07
What's the official name?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:08:22
I’m doing it from windows, however I already it now using standard not 2FA.
I’m having an issue receiving the BTC from GDAX. I did a test amount of .003 btc, but I do not see it generated on my electrum wallet. How long does the process usually take to receive?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:33:04
Alright, thanks so much for the help!
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:55:03
If you don't have income, why are you willing to risk it all... lol
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:09:33
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:59:56
Yes I can read, but even that long ago the price rose to what? $1250?
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:30:24
Great video to watch, wish I got involved in BTC 3 years ago. Either way, don’t think I would’ve held this long unless I left it in cold storage and forgot about it.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:07:29
It’s been at the peak now since 2 weeks almost
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:41:44
Panic sold my ethereum and bitcoin, feelsbadman.jpg
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:14:16
November 1 and the weeks leading up to it will be a blood bath
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:14:01
BTC won't be banned, but looks like potentially all exchanges in china will be banned.  
Will be interesting to see how this plays out :-)
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:01:45
I actually like this 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:22:30
Thank you for the help. Do you know roughly how long it’ll take since GDAX didn’t impose a fee for the transfer to my external wallet? I want to make sure I get the BTC in my external wallet before the fork. 
I also can’t adjust the adjust the fee via coinbase, it’s a fixed fee.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:07:14
Is the site Blockchain.info? Or blockexplorer.com?
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:42:41
"Fallout from Chinese exchanges closing is slow" -- huh?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:07:20
How many confirmations do I need total to officially  receive it? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:53:32
I see that you don’t google
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:24:19
Agreed, high times are nice but corrections are nicer��
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:01:11
What if I never receive confirmations because I didn’t attach a fee to my transaction?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:38:51
Because right when you set that limit, it’ll hit, and then proceed to sky rocket. Doesn’t everyone know this?
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:53:09
Really could've used this earlier today
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:31:39
Yes because that's exactly how it works
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:06:45
Is $500 still not enough to say to yourself ..”eh I’ll check it out?” 
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:02:50
I don’t plan on day trading continuously. I’m only riding these small waves which have shown consistency, it’s not difficult to notice. I’ll be all in again once the sharp dips occur again, until then, I’m playing my luck. I only put money in at the lowest point (s) of the day on the 6hr interval and get out after I make around $250-300 per trade to keep it safe. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:20:41
Lucky you have fiat readily available :(
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:20:25
Doesn't bitcoin core take awhile to download?
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:01:00
Nobody knows man... it may shoot up tomorrow as well because of the huge loses btc suffered and then tank again... may surge back to $5k.... who tf knows... I just know once sept 30 and oct 30th come it'll be another blood bath probably.... and maybe mid October due to panic about the fork
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:04:39
I went to blockchain info and typed in my electrum receive address and it shows 0 transactions
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:09:17
It won’t retrace without negative news though
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:46:10
Or you could make off a few grand riding the small waves
@_date: 2017-10-11 03:35:41
What’s the value?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:41:39
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:21:53
Oh, interesting. So I should always transfer from GDAX vs coinbase so I don’t have to pay that fee, correct?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:54:22
I looked it up on coinbase and it has 0 confirmations, over an hour ago. Is there a way that I can cancel the transaction because it was only .003 BTC ($17) and I looked on coinbase and was not charged a transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-10-11 03:39:17
I thought the fork was happening in November?
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:53:28
Google translate the article pls
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:14:34
Has been pumping and dumping all day. Will drop $200-300 then pump the same amount then drop further, if only I had the balls to buy these pump n dumps :(
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:34:57
No, not yet. Are you doing the same thing as me? (i.e., sending from GDAX to electrum thru the “receive” address via electrum?)
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:29:48
I.e., a price drop? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:54:28
Doesn’t it occur in the next 100 blocks? (Around 16hrs?)
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:42:08
How do I find the transaction ID on GDAX or electrum? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:27:24
Great explanations and thoughts IMO - enjoyed the read, thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:39:03
Maybe you should include the other most recent decline? (Mid August ~4400 --&gt; ~3650)
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:05:29
What good times?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:28:58
I have electrum, will I be able to recover BTG?
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:33:22
Which ones have closed?
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:01:50
How do you get that value? I tried searching but couldn’t find anything. Pretty high value for receiving additional coins, sounds like free money to me no? Lol
What about BTC Gold?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:52:18
I never said you were wrong lol
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:52:53
People have said no matter the amount (via GDAX) no fee is imposed.
Coinbase was charging a fixed $1.77 fee for any amount I entered
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:12:33
What if it tanks another 10-20%? Certainly might wake up with a hangover
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:11:28
So sending it to the “receive” electrum address vs. sending it to the master public key is fine?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:51:38
I don’t have a transaction ID! 
My receive address is:
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:11:58
Yeah but won’t I technically have 3 coins at the times of the split? 
If I own a hardwallet with my BTC on it, do I need to do anything? I know this it’s exhausting to keep repeating the same shit but I haven’t really followed BTC as closely as eth / ltc. But now I own some BTC so I care lol
