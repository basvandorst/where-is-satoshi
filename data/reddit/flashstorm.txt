How is this phishing exactly?

I know it seems kind of unrealistic, but a 2000+ randomly distributed sample is more than sufficient to represent a population of pretty much any size given that the any member of the population could have been chosen to be in the sample. The 0.4% figure is misleading, whats more important is how the sample was chosen.

It means 3 and 4 and implies 2. Basically if you download the block chain, it is possible that software on your machine can interpret and run arbitrary code by reading off the blockchain This code could steal your coins.

Statistically, nothing can be "more profitable" than solo mining. Assuming no variance with luck and no fees/wasted cpus in a pool, it should take just as long to mine 50btc in a pool as it would be to find your own block. Joining a pool simply gives you the convienence of reduced variability as well as smaller, more frequent payouts. In fact, for small miners it may be the only way to see any reasonable payouts for their efforts in the immediate future.

The only way to increase one's likelyhood of getting more bitcoins is to produce more hashes, and this is typically done by running multiple GPUs, either on one machine or over many.

Mathematically, it doesnt matter which pool you enter: the hashrate you contribute overall is the only thing that affects the statistical likelyhood of you recieving profits. The only ways that pools can increase or decrease your theoretical payout is by charging a fee or by wasting your cpu cycles. In the end, finding a low-fee but feaure rich pool are the only requirements for maximising profits over time. Beyond that, all pools are mathematically equal.

A few years ago, I sent nearly 2btc to an address that I know I controlled and I have no idea where it went.
