"former holder" as in GoxUser?  Hope not.

Do you trade from FIAT or looking to leverage your BTCs?  I presonally love Bitfinex to leverage my BTCs.  I do not care about FIAT but want to leverage my BTCs to get more, so Bitfinex is for me.

Why the need to be so full of yourself?

Great article - But - "Not being said" shoud read "Not understand by everyone" - And there is sooooo much to understand about Bitcoin that not eveyone will know everything.

With a cap.  Unless green dollars, gov can't just print as much as they want, diluting value.

I'd be interested to see the same survey in a "Gold Lovers" forum...

Do not underestimate the fat geek.  The plan works as expected.

Read.  Between.  The.  Lines.
Invent something.  Let others find it.  Let others try it.  Let others do the mistakes.  Let others... Let others... Observe.

NSA - Should be a simple enough answer.
And once they're done with this massive live test, they'll launch the "Real" American Coin.

If you were Coinage2011, I'd say ok.  2014... Now do your homework about "how it all started", namely a famous 1996 report...
