Electricity can be cheap in India, and we do mine, but the issue is with the supporting ecosystem. Import duties are high(GPU etc) and ASIC imports are restricted. Government is still dilly dallying over regulation.

Only in some public areas like railway stations. Most indians connect to the internet through smartphones at the moment, even higher than broadband. They either use 2g/3g/4g or free WiFi occasionally(I've never used it and I live here). 
Bitcoin trading is prevelant in tier 1 and 2 cities and adoption is on an explosive curve, especially after the government demonitised currency a year ago to go after money laundering.

Indian trader here. Banks have been giving a hard time to exchanges, but our exchanges are also dbags(they've been selling at a huge premium all this time and trading themselves). In the absence of regulation, FUD is king in the market. This same news of exchanges accounts being suspended has been doing the rounds(salty media celebrating Bitcoin ban(according to them)) and spreading FUD for weeks now. It started after the IT department raided all exchanges last month to ascertain market size and tax compliance. I'm sure a lot of skeletons tumbled out the closet that time and the exchanges are busy working out payment methods since.

Oh we did imagine everything, we just didn't know when and how fast change will come. 25 years ago, my dad waited for a landline connection from the government for 5 years. In '98 I bought my first pc and a shell internet connection over dialup. Maybe I was lucky to live in a city where we had these options. But we still had hours of power cuts every day. Downloading a music track took hours and IRC was all the rage. The fight in the countryside was still about food at that time. Today villages are getting electricity, sanitation and broadband and the kids are getting connected via broadband or 4g for the first time just like I was 15 years ago. It's still extremely bleak considering how poor people still are, but that has never stopped us from seeking a better future. With the internet reaching every corner, a social revolution is well and truly underway. The next few decades are going to be very eventful.

Nah our fud is weak. Same news is being picked up by different media houses for a month now(banks giving exchanges a hard time, and IT department crackdown/notices). People are still trading, though withdrawals have been hit.

That's not how you arb. You keep fiat in one exchange and coin in the other. Then make a simultaneous trade to arbitrage. Then rotate the coin and fiat back to the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:25:41
Yeah, helped a friend set up arbitrage. He's having a ball, I'm poor so mining bit by bit instead of buying too much on this premium.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:27:15
Nope. Government policy on btc will come soon. Infact today they are raiding exchanges lol

Though I haven't seen the movie, it's probably a victory dance. The movie it's about Bajirao, a military general in the Maratha empire. He never lost a battle in his 20 years of military career. Marathas wanted to drive out the Mughals from power and reestablish Hindu rule over the subcontinent. At the height of their power they controlled about half of the subcontinent but could not consolidate fast enough to prevent the Brits from gaining a foothold and profiting from the power vacuum.

Well, that's history for you. The Islamic invasion of India from the north was ideological and bloody, whereas the spread of Islam in the south was peaceful via trade. The invasion was actually a series of invasions which started around 900AD, after which multiple Islamic warlords tried to conquer the land of non believers. It was at around 1500AD that the Mughal dynasty was in control of a significant landmass, even then much of the south was not in their control. There were emperors like Akbar who were essentially tolerant but then there were a few like Aurangzeb who were religious zealots. In short, there was a lot of bloodshed.

New generation of cinema taking hold here. Bigger budgets, better equipment, higher revenues etc.. the right time for period films as talented directors can do justice to the subjects. The younger crop of actors is hip. Many are of course there because daddy made it in Bollywood but some like this fellow are absolutely killing it on their own. 
I've personally hated Indian cinema for the last 30 years. The 60's-80's were my favorites. Beyond that it looked like people ran out of ideas. The actors were terrible, music was shitty and the storyline was usually pathetic. After a long time I'm feeling I may have missed out on a few good movies.

Gandhi's contribution to the Indian independence struggle is probably incomprehensible to most non Indians. He was a shrewd politician not without his faults but with the ability to galvanize the masses for a common goal. He's a national icon for good reason.

Why do you think the Chinese government has restricted miners from leaving the country and blocked exchanges? They want their stash. That being said, I think most have already sold or have transferred their coins to exchanges abroad.

This has happened to me. Malwarebytes took care of it. Probably through a rogue mining software. Have you installed any lately?

It's fine. I'm still learning about Bitcoin so expect to see me comment here often. Being Indian I'm used to this. Don't worry about me :) I'm chill

Found the disgruntled Nepali. Maybe we should close the borders again and watch you squeal. 
Came here to learn about Bitcoin as some exchanges are active in India now. Didn't expect this..
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:30:42
Ok buddy. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder regarding India. Don't really have time for bullshi when there is money to be made. Keep hating.

1. Demonitization was temporary. It didn't affect me much at all actually. New cash is in circulation already. Apart from that, this has pushed people towards digital transaction, which is the need of the hour and great for bitcoin too. so I don't know why YOU are whining. Maybe you were holdiing Indian currency and got shafted?
2. Caste system is outlawed and irrelevant in urban India. Please tell me how many times did you see anyone be discriminated against because of their caste while you were in india. 
3. You're the typical troll, citing problems after problems. Please tell me where in the world corruption isn't a problem, or for that matter racism or women empowerment. You're listing humanity's great flaws and pinning it on Indians. Of course these problems exist because we are just a subset of humanity. Our freedom lies in the fact that we can change this. The status quo is being challenged in India on a daily basis. That's all the freedom that you need. We are the great melting pot of humanity, change is the only constant here and I'm only concerned about the direction it takes. I've got no choice but to accept where I was born or at what point in time, what I can choose though is my outlook towards life. If I don't practice caste or oppress women then I'm the delta sloping upwards and I influence my near and dear ones. I'm a drop in the ocean but I influence it in a small way too and that's the freedom that I have. In the end it's stupid to freeze the moment in time and view the truth as absolute. Everything is relative and the trend is ever important.
4. let's see what else you got..I'll bite. Even though this is absolutely irrelevant to bitcoin.
