I'm not writing this nine days later to say "I told you so." Just be aware that there is no such thing as a pattern when it comes to trading. Our brains like to identify patterns that don't really exist (like looking at a bunch of stars and seeing the signs of the zodiac).

This is actually very positive news for Bitcoin.  The most powerful IT company in the world is acknowledging that only a decentralized currency can challenge the status quo, otherwise it would surely be shut down or very much inhibited by regulation.
@_date: 2012-04-21 19:04:58
I just added a comment to the blog entry.  Someone in a chat room suggested that it might be gift cards.  If so, that would make a lot of sense, because they could be purchased with credit cards and Bitinstant wouldn't be subjected to any chargeback liability (the onus would be on the merchant selling the card, i.e. Wal-Mart or 7-11).

@_date: 2011-12-13 15:52:11
1) Yes, there would be a documented link between you, as an Agent, and the recipient of the gifts.  If someone decides to spend Bitcoins through Bitcoin Gifter, it is no different than someone spending Bitcoins at another Bitcoin-accepting site.  As far as legal implications go, I think we're in new territory.  No one has ever been charged of a crime for spending or receiving Bitcoins (to my knowledge).
2) Yes I do.  They are held in a Strongcoin account.
3) I will put together a more detailed terms of service, shortly.  An email confirmation of proof of purchase will suffice, I'm not going to be picky.  If the gift is not received, I may ask the Agent to conduct a basic investigation.  Regardless, I will never ask the Agent to refund their compensation.  I will personally eat the loss if I believe the client's complaint is legit.
@_date: 2011-10-18 10:22:42
Tit for tat.  Telling me I've pulled my data out of my ass is going to garner an equally mature response.  My data is the Bitcoin distribution curve with an assumption that Bitcoin will succeed.  I'm a fan - I think it will.

Oh, well yes.  I thought you were referring to the PayPal orders.  For the Bitcoin orders, the Bitcoins come from the client, of course.

The new Bitcoin Gifter site has just been launched.  I feel that this aspect of working for us as an Agent has not been emphasized enough:
If you shop online for us, you will be reimbursed 105% of your costs, in Bitcoin.  It's a simple, risk-free way for you to buy Bitcoins with a credit card.  
Please see our [list of Agents]( and, if we currently do not have one for your country (or state in the US), send an email to support
@_date: 2011-12-09 01:47:34
Another good idea.  Thanks.

David, along with most of the media, puts Bitcoin in one of two categories: either it has to be THE way people will make payments in the future, or it will be a failure.
Bitcoin as a payment system (i.e. pay Suzy 2 Bitcoins for 5 apples) is merely the first layer of an extremely deep and complex protocol that can do so much more.  
Bitcoin 0.6, with new transaction types, is just starting to give us a look at these additional layers, and keep in mind that 0.6 is a *beta* version!
Will I ever be able to use Facebook credits or Square to donate to a project in such a way that I'm guaranteed to get my money back if the project never launches?  Absolutely not, but Bitcoin will be able to do that without human intervention.
Bitcoin is not a payment system, it's a new, peer-to-peer financial model that can replace most of the functionality currently only found in a global bank with thousands of employees.
I understand where David is coming from, but we have larger targets in our sights than 14 year-olds on Facebook.

"Right now, Bitcoin's main function is as a pump-and-dump scheme wherein early adopters - who have more bitcoins than anyone else ever will - hype it up so they can offload their bitcoins onto fools who think they'll strike it rich as speculators. Thus, Bitcoin's creators have successfully mined a hitherto-unexploited resource: the vast reserves of unexamined privilege amongst computer programmers. Remember: the classic con is to get the mark to think they're putting one over on you."

You can never reverse a Bitcoin transaction.  A contract would allow a third party to determine whether Bitcoins could be released to one party or another, but once they're released, it's permanent.  The problem with involving a credit card in this situation is that the credit card payment could still be reversed after the contracted Bitcoin transaction was finalized.  In conclusion, this is why credit cards are terrible.
Also, Bitcoin contracts have not yet been implemented, though the code allows for it.

If you're smart about it, you can just wait for an arbitrage opportunity, like this morning, and send money for free or better.

Bitcoin's value, per coin, is the potential value of the Bitcoin economy divided by 21 million.  If you believe that the potential value is greater than the current market cap, you should be buying right now and holding long term (if investing is your goal).
The downward trend implies that investors do not believe the Bitcoin economy will ever be worth as much as it's being traded for at the moment, or at least will ever be worth that much in the timeframe they are willing to absorb the opportunity cost of holding BTC.  
I find this shocking and incomprehensible, given Bitcoin's potential.

@_date: 2011-12-12 00:23:13
Yes, Agents are in full control of the amount they are buying.  As each Agent comes online, they express the maximum they are willing to spend on any one gift.
I would consider myself a prominent member of the Bitcoin community.  I am the blogger behind [thebitcointrader.com]( and most people around here know me quite well.  I value my reputation more than a few thousand dollars - Bitcoin is the future and I want to be a part of it.

Yes.  I have not yet tried to withdraw (I didn't deposit enough) but the owner of the site tells me it is a straight-forward withdrawal to your Bitcoin wallet.  And their exchange rate is very reasonable.
Edit: you can only withdraw during weekday business hours.  Do not use this method if you're in any sort of rush.  My credit card also charged me a $5 cash advance fee for depositing through moneybookers.

How is Ripple a competitor? It's centralized and pre-mined; there's no way it could possibly compete with Bitcoin. Except for the decentralized built-in exchanges, the ability to move all types of currencies, the fact that it can execute 12000 transactions per second, true micro-transaction support, no blockchain to download, no waste of hardware/energy on mining, besides all that, I don't see how Ripple is a competitor.

FINCEN just announced that it is legal to transact with Bitcoins. In other words, the US government just gave a legal nod to use Bitcoin to move any amount of money, anywhere, instantly, without requiring any regulatory framework. That is the opposite of what everyone expected to happen.

There's a catch-22 going on here. If you invent a global payment system that is extremely easy to use, quick, cheap, and efficient, by definition it has to integrate seamlessly with the existing banking system. To do so, anonymity goes out the window, and adherence to MT and MSB regulations becomes mandatory. Suddenly, you no longer have the anarchist-utopia that is Bitcoin, but something completely different, like Ripple. Because of this, if people want Bitcoin to "retain it's values" it will have no choice but to remain fringe and inefficient, therefore niche and never widely adoptable or successful.

These are pretty much all of the Bitcoin gambling sites.

How is anyone getting scammed? What's the scam, actually?

I hate conspiracy theories, but...
... what he said about Money Transmitter licensing is absolutely true. $25 million was probably for a single state, let alone the entire country. 
Look at what happened to one of the former co-founders of Facebook when he tried to obtain a [Money Transmitter license in California]( exactly where the first Bitcoin ATM was (is) to be deployed.
If you want to bring media attention to how hard it is for anyone to compete with the banking mafia, then this is the perfect move: promote BitcoinATM in major media outlets, get the general public excited about it, and then unexpectedly withdraw from the project. When the mainstream media follows up to find out how the project is going, they would then shine a spotlight on the fiasco that is the current banking system, and stir up awareness that would end up promoting new options like Bitcoin and Ripple. 
Anyway, even if his withdrawal is real, hopefully it will have the same effect.

The comments on the article show that there is still a tonne of upside left.  Even the geeks who read Slashdot are not yet convinced that Bitcoin is viable.

The title of this post is an outright lie.

That just makes it cheaper to send transactions over the network. Ripples are the fee you pay to send USD/CAD/EUR, whatever. Ripples aren't the point; the network is the point.

The BTC/USD market on Ripple isn't very liquid.  Right now XRP/USD and XRP/BTC are the most traded combinations. The entire Ripple network only has $80,000 USD moving within it at this time, it's very new.
To get USD/CAD/AUD/BTC/Whatever into Ripple, you have to go through a Gateway. There are only two at the moment, Weexchange.co and Bitstamp.net.

One more thing regarding Seals, there's a [113 page thread]( with 113,000 views on the 2+2 forums, specifically discussing Seals. Anyone who's paying attention over there would have noticed the discussion.

This app does a pretty good job of integrating Bitcoin wallets into Facebook.

iPoker (through WinPoker), the 4th largest online poker network, and Revolution (through RedStar Poker), the 11th largest online poker network, both now accept Bitcoin. RedStar accepts US players. Here's the complete list: 
I would say that the online poker world has indeed caught onto Bitcoin.

I think that's part of the reason why it's so popular.  Every transaction can be verified in the blockchain.  There are users independently tracking the profit/loss of each of the betting options, and while there is always variance, the percentage earned for SatoshiDice is trending toward the advertised rate.

I know it's not popular to mention Ripple in these parts, but if you want to sell shares in your Bitcoin-related company, just issue the asset in Ripple, like the guy with the silver dimes. It's a decentralized exchange so it can't get shut down.
