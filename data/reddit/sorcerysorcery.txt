What is in your opinion the biggest obstacle for Bitcoin at this moment?
What do you think would be the most important factor in bringing Bitcoin to the masses?
Where do you see Bitcoin is five years?
I am also doing a big senior school project on Bitcoin, would you mind answering a few questions from us about Bitcoin? It would be a great way to teach the young public about cryptocurrencies.

As a 16 year old whose parents are exactly like OP said this is a good idea. Mine are rational and would think this would be a good idea. Only I already bought some Bitcoin 'under the radar' (I really want to know what they would think when I told them my profits). And YES, in my friends circle a lot of guys know what Bitcoin is (without me ever explaining it) but none have some and they are more interested in accumulating a fortune than the protocol.

Do the translators get payed in Bitcoin or do they improve the Bitcoin wallet experience on Mac OSX? Either way I will email Hive to help. :)

A small shop for foreign products (like vanilla Coke) in Haarlem is also accepting Bitcoins. I don't know the exact name for the shop.

Checked again and now I have euros on it! I think because of the DDOSes it took longer than expected. Thanks!
