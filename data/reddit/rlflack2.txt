They are not bankrupt if they are not liable for the BTC loss, which seems to be their position, buttressed by the terms and conditions.

Zane thanks for your unrelenting updates - appreciated. My account is not currently verified as I would use BTC withdrawal typically. However I have a significant USD balance so would like to verify my account as soon as the site is back online, what documentation do I need for this and can you remit USD to a GBP account?

You keep saying this but you are disregarding the fundamental point that if you are otherwise insolvent, all unsecured creditors rank equally in your insolvency and thus will share all available amounts pari passu. This is unless USD accounts are held in trust for account holders according to any HK client money rules - that is the fundamental question that must be answered re USD, not 'was USD stolen' which is irrelevant.

What do you mean regardless of what the TOS said? It is a fundamental term of the contract. Ultimately it is a question of HK insolvency and contract law and weather the term could be struck out for unreasonableness but I doubt it based on English precedents.

If Bitfinex attempts to unilaterally 'socialise' losses as has been suggested here a legal can of worms will open. Unilaterally, and deliberately, reallocating customer property to other customers is quite different from omitting to take the necessary steps to prevent the BTC wallet hack.
The fundamental assumption that is made by those holding USD in the exchange is that they do not hold an exposure to BTC (neither its price fluctuation or the risks inherent in the underlying technology, which manifestly is still not secure). On the other hand, holders of BTC understand and accept the volatility and the security risks.
It would be very difficult to argue against the enforceability of the exclusion clause for loss in Bitfinex's Term of Service - it is entirely standard and does not include an exception for gross negligence. Unless Bitfinex has been fraudulent, it is very difficult to see how they could be held liable vis a vis BTC holders. The holders of BTC may seek to challenge this but in my view it is unlikely to be upheld.  
Dollar depositors are different, they have not suffered a loss, they did not wish to be exposed to BTC or any of its associated risks. If funds are misappropriated out of USD deposits to 'socialise' the losses in any other manner than a formal insolvency process supervised by a 3rd party insolvency official or court, Bitfinex expose themselves to even greater liabilities.

if there is a 'haircut' applied to USD amounts which has not been sanctioned by a court or insolvency official your directors are going to prison.

please can you confirm how fiat is held in bitfinex - in segregated client bank accounts that would survive the insolvency of bitfinex as they should be hopefully?

They can't liquidate the assets/apply haircuts without appointing an insolvency official, either through a court process or otherwise.
The better view is that BFX are not liable to BTC holders because (I) the terms and conditions expressly exclude their liability for losses of this type; (ii) they have not been fraudulent. Accordingly they should assume they are solvent.
