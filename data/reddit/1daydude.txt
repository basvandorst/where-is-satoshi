Nice concept, thanks for sharing. Be good to see it plug into other sites and pull information from them so not only seeing just opportuities posted direct on site
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:06:34
Oh brilliant first brexit now this. Let's leave every possible market

Relying on any investment to get rich is probably pretty crazy. But right now bitcoin is offering based on historical trends the best rate of interest vs traditional investments.

Any technology offers a number of advantages and disadvantages. Some have overhyped blockchain, but this is a truly unique technology for situations with untrusted parties. Work is needed on scale and adoption etc but this is early days
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:11:27
Would be good for growth and confidence to rid the market of manipulation
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:20:33
Interesting idea and agreed more in depth analysis is generally required. However the challenge with the crypto market is that most of the projects are just ideas or in the very early stages. So trying to assess things like the quality of the team or the technology is very difficult because it is not production or at least in early stages of development. But I do admire your ambition and I think further discussion of how projects can be valued is needed

You can never get too much centralised decentralisation ��

He sites bitcoin interest dropping Google Trends as a measure of market interest. But I do wonder if it is a lagging indicator, if prices start to go up then search for cryptocurrencies on Google would also increase

I reckon dirty stuff happens in all markets, look at all this stuff about Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos this week
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:30:38
Seems like anyone can make up a figure and it makes headlines
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:12:06
Think there will be some pretty massive psychological barriers to it getting to this value
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:29:52
Not surprised at this price
@_date: 2018-05-19 07:23:54
A lot of alt coins are actually tokens. Not intended to be used for currencies but link directly to a company. Companies can use the ICO process to raise money and then have branded tokens to drive customer value and loyalty
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:36:25
Ouch this sounds steep
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:56:50
Yes they really do believe it, hence their claim to bitcoin.com etc
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:17:16
Need some text to explain this
@_date: 2018-05-25 06:38:41
Because bitcoins worth more
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:04:19
Agreed regulation and adoption go hand in hand

Is the Hydro outfit a specialised crypto datacenter? Is the reasoning it's cheaper than running it at home
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:37:09
Did he ever manage to get out of the costume?
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:08:44
Definitely sounds interesting. There is no lack of opinion in this space but a lack of good technical knowledge. I don't think format is that important just start from the basics and build up
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:15:00
Oh man those alerts must have been distracting when things were booming!
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:51:54
LOL brilliant
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:02:52
I heard the same figure 4 million
@_date: 2018-05-15 07:03:12
To the moon, lambo o'clock
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:09:43
Pushing adoption
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:45:33
ASIC mining creates another form of centralisation because the specialist chips can only be produced by a handful of companies. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:43:43
Coinbase probably easiest method to use with a card. Although it will be more fees vs a bank transfer
@_date: 2018-03-14 08:31:34
Although we'd all be supporting the same team!
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:48:52
I was also looking at Google Trends yesterday, and there has been a real sustained downward dip in Bitcoin search terms. With less buyers it seems likely the price will decline further
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:41:05
Interesting concept and worthwhile since I think this is such a sentiment driven market. Although I think the challenges people tend to be very bullish around the coins they hold, which could mislead true sentiment
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:51:50
Uh oh, brace!
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:51:36
Definitely a good example of where not having a middle man reduces risk
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:18:21
Agreed transaction fees are important to adoption
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:02:58
Likewise I agree, only time will tell.
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:01:19
Never heard of anything like this
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:47:12
Exactly I don't think this is an either or argument
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:45:51
Not all cryptocurrencies require energy hungry proof of work. Also I don't think you can burn coins
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:59:29
They change their mind every 5 minutes if it's going to crash or moon
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:55:40
Ok if my Guinness tastes off tonight I'll know who to blame ��
