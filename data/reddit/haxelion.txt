Just ... read ... it ... Part 2.3 Classification where he explains in details how he generated his test set ...
It's very simple: he splits each user comments in two distinct set to create two new fake users and look at how can identify the twins in this set.

I'll reexplain at the top comment:
Because of the small sample size he knows his algorithm is not perfect.
If you read the article you'll see that he estimate to only be able to detect 25% of the multi accounts and with a 50% false positive rate. So he admits that in his suspect list only 50% are correct. 
All he concludes is that at least 50% of his list is right so there is widespread comment manipulation in this subreddit. So the suspect list is just a start, human work is needed to extract the true from the false.

He only claimed a 50% precision meaning he knows half of the list is wrong.

If you read the damn thing you'll see he claims to only be able to flag 25% of the multi account cases but with a 50% false positive rate.
So yeah he admits himself that half of the list is wrong, but that's the best he could do.

This guy is confusing network latency with network speed. Network speed is not linked with the speed of light, there is no hard bound.
Yes, an increase in block size increase the time it takes to send a block over the network (this is not called latency). However this time can be reduced with a better network speed.
The transfer time of new blocks is still orders of magnitude lower than the average computation time for mining new block. Doubling the block size (and that transfer time) would thus have a negligible impact.

As you said yourself, only because you enforce an ordering of packets in your networking protocol.
Also, as you pointed out, the TCP receiving window is exactly there to reduce the effect of latency. Increasing it is quite easy. Another simple way is to use multiple concurrent TCP streams to parallelize the transfer. Another alternative is to switch to a protocol without transmission control like UDP.
If really you had a 300ms latency to the internet with the default TCP receiving window size your bandwidth would maxed at 1.75 Mbps. Is that truly your internet experience? Or have the software you're using figured out a way around the problem? ;-)
