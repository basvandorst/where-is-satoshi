Same reason that skeptics are quiet when it rallies up.

It would take me a long time to look through all my posts to find it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:30:30
I hate these charts. So misleading.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:51:52
Expects or expected?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:48:18
I agree with this chart.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:23:50
It’s 7607 right now.

Mostly because he sold when the price shot up. That’s more difficult to do than it sounds.

The 5k by March estimate could easily happen at this rate. Predicting December seems more difficult.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:14:00
I remember when it was $18k and I suggested it could go down to $8k and you should have seen some of the comments I got about how crazy I was.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:18:58
50% of what it was a little over a month ago!

Never trust a chart where 3,000 is half way us the side to 20,000.

I see lot of lines going to the moon because it makes people feel better ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:47:25
Smart man ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:52:15
That’s adorable ♥️ 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:36:23
Because I give you $5, you give me a sandwich. 
I give you $1400, you give me one share of amazon.com. 
I give you $7,500, you give me.. one bitcoin? What am I supposed to do with this and why does it cost so much?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:24:32
I think it will stabilize around $5k and may break out again in another year. No guess of how high it will get again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:46:45
Lamb is go for like $250k plus so you’d need at least $100k to even stand a chance.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:18:59
$9,000 is the new $10,000.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:05:06
I couldn’t believe it when on CNBC they said it’s $6,xxx just now. How is it still dropping this fast?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:42:03
If it ever does again, maybe late 2019.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:34:38
Drops to around 5k at the end of the month and hovers around there for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:52:44
Yes there will be many Super Bowl ads still happening.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:14:13
If it makes people buy more then why has bitcoin gone from $17k - 7k in one month?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:40:12
What does bitcoin have to do with the stock market? Post somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:12:23
Not everyone has the hodl mentality. People don’t want to lose their shirts if they don’t believe it will bounce back.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:01:39
Zooming out just proves the crash is inevitable.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:41:23
I’d prefer if it was $.05
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:38:03
These lines are worthless. If you believe in the technology and it’s future, buy it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:14:33
Not yet.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:19:48
Looks like they are.
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:23:09
I know but when someone asks me how much bitcoin I have, 1 sound so much better than .91749201.
