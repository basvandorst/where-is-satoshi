Congrats! I recently made my first purchase as well, and it was more exciting than you might expect.

Couldn't it be on the review as an investment with a dollar value?  It's not any less stable than a given stock.  I see what you mean though.  Makes sense to cover your ass in that kind of situation.  
I expect this is part of the reason retailers getting in on Bitcoin today are converting straight to USD.  Progress is progress, but it's not as good as cash yet.

That soda costs three cents to make, so I'd be willing to bet that's a worse deal.

Well, I use bfgminer on linux.  cgminer is another good one.  Almost no use of the CPU.

We do? I have checks, but can't remember the last time I used them. Possibly never, actually. The only time I see actual paper checks is gifts from older people. Almost everything is digital.

The best way to get anything out of mining is to treat it like a hobby.  It's actually pretty fun, and the passive income isn't worthless.  You aren't going to get rich, and you probably will only break even.  I have my single USB block erupter ([here]( running on a machine that is on 24/7 anyway, and I recommend that.
I think of it as converting a little of my USD into BTC, and contributing to the system in my own tiny way.

Bitcoin or doge tip integration makes more sense than a niche on a niche on a niche altcoin that is irrelevant outside of reddit.  I'm not sure if there is much money in tip integration, but it's a neat idea if they can do better than the bots today do.

Yes but all 426 wouldn't immediately be using bitcoin. The number of people using the network may gradually increase, but it wouldn't spike like that. But the rest of your point is good.
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:02:57
Yeah, but those people freely chose to donate, it's not really fair to say this cause is "better" than that one
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:54:38
Yelp is sleezy and I refuse to support them, but a lot of people do trust them, so this could still be good for the cause.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:07:18
Yeah, but that is impractical and harder to trust, which would hinder wider adoption
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:39:06
Hosted wallets are going to be a problem as regulation creeps in, I have to agree. Personal wallet or bust. There are tons of good ones that are easy to set up, and coinbase is already paying the tx fee, no real reason to keep coins there unless you're actively buying or selling.

The "most likely would have scammed him" part. That doesn't seem fair at all. Also, asking about downvotes is a good way to get more downvotes.
@_date: 2014-07-02 06:06:10
Yes, but this was a cashout. The USMS doesn't care about the politics of this or about bitcoin itself, which is fine for both sides I think.  They probably put that clause in to filter out fraud and maybe known criminals or criminal organizations. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:43:05
Fair enough. That sounded like their more recent commercials. I just can't bring myself to believe Apple stands for these things today.

This is what I do, and I think this is pretty common. I know some people prefer the check for security or some other reason.

Not finding problems is either lying or ineptitude.  Services that deal with money will always be under attack and that problem is never solved 100%. It's an ongoing struggle and those that stay ahead will be more reliable.

This American Life is a decent vector for getting this information to people that normally wouldn't give this an iota of attention. I hope that they are able to get this into terms most folks can understand and care about. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:08:06
I have to agree; while the paradox of choice is a real thing, I don't think it applies here. People going to this page have already decided to donate; more payment options isn't going to make them close the tab and give up. Is this why discover is also excluded? Been a while since I've seen someone not accepting discover and amex.

The game industry has this problem in a big way.  Sponsored news is so frustrating when you're just trying to get legitimate news or reviews or whatever.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:16:36
Completely agree. Why bother with bitcoin if it has the same limitations as fiat? Having to give your bank account information and identification to an exchange feels the same as giving it to PayPal.  I have no interest in laundering money or dealing drugs, but I am interested in anonymous digital transactions.
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:09:20
The tax code is going to make this hairy no matter how you slice it. User to user transactions are global, and this is awesome, but it's going to be a while before you see international business to consumer transactions being as easy as user to user. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:53:49
The second one is big for me. The potential is there for it to be a intermediary currency between two currencies, and even to fully replace fiat in international transactions. This is a pretty cool thing in an age of rapid globalization. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 14:25:47
Also, I don't think it would have changed anything had they deleted it. This story is out of Andrew and Rajiv's hands at this point.
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:53:01
It's the same to the end user though, typically.  Not that I disagree with the premise; it's quite a strange design indeed. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:31:39
Can you explain that? You mean capital gains on the appreciated bitcoin value? Because you're already taxed on the fiat before you convert it. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:04:49
There are plenty of things that fit those criteria that people aren't interested in or don't catch on with consumers.  These things are a good sign, of course, and I think bitcoin is likely to deliver on some of its promises.  As a non-bitcoin example, I don't think the wearable tech movement is going to be anywhere close to as interesting as the smartphone revolution was.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:09:37
But it's all hot air. What does an iPhone have to do with any of that?
@_date: 2014-09-20 06:35:44
Shadowban doesn't work like that. It doesn't delete all of the user's posts (although a mod or someone could do that). Click on his username and it'll come up empty. That's a shadowpaddlin'
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:48:43
Yeah, best to put the OS and critical programs on the SSD and data (moves, music, pictures, documents) on a big ole disc drive.
@_date: 2014-04-13 06:14:11
What does something like this cost?  Are viewers really invested enough in a player to care about an ad on their shirt? Having trouble seeing the upshot here.
I think it'd be better to get some high profile players and teams accepting donations in bitcoin; surely that would get more exposure and would actually get money moving around.  
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:11:26
I'd be worried about bitcoin being lumped in with the plethora of payment processing services out there. Bitcoin can serve that purposes but it's more than that. I think it could dilute the message. I gotta agree with not over-annoying people with it. It has to catch on organically.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:01:53
I think you would be well received there. If you were in my state you'd get my support. Good luck! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:20:25
Gox is still one of the most well known exchanges, so it could injure the image of the stability of bitcoin in the mainstream.
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:23:44
Agreed, solid implementation.  I would like to see more sites going with mili-bit listings as well.
@_date: 2014-05-17 16:52:54
That was my first thought. It bears some resemblance to Valve's organizational structure. Cool idea.
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:18:59
As others have said, it's cost per gig. I want the blockchain on my multi terabyte data drive, and don't really need SSD speed for that. So this is good news for me! 
@_date: 2014-10-18 08:00:51
Speculation, but it's probably encrypted while in transit and when sitting on Google's servers. It only needs to run each email once through their keyword whatever filter to pull ad data; and it's either not encrypted at this stage, or encrypted in such a way that the ad thing can decrypt and recrypt
@_date: 2014-07-11 17:39:12
You can definitely still do both. Everything in moderation works for diet, and applies here too. If this works for you, more power to you, but this fast food analogy is taken too far here.

I'll need to look into my bitcoinqt settings, I didn't realize port forwarding was necessary and that UPnP was disabled by default. Can a full node even run over wifi? 
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:34:55
Yeah, I haven't considered this before, but PayPal is really well positioned to be a middleman and make money with digital transactions of BTC.  That'd be major progress for legitimizing it as well as being able to use it at major retailers.

As a tech alum with bitcoin, I suspect bitcoin possession is probably pretty common on the campus already. I'm pretty pumped about this news.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:46:40
Maybe this is just me, but I unsubscribed from technology, and went out and subscribed to specific technologies that I'm interested in (bitcoin, truegaming, programming, etc).  Default subs are sort of painful and often overmoderated.  Garbage gets upvoted and clutters up the hot feed.  Find better subs dedicated to topics you care about, unsub defaults, and don't look back.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:48:33
I suspect that is a saturated or low demand market. Good luck though.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:33:17
If that's the case, mining hardware will come off the network and the difficulty will go back down, meaning better profit for the hardware still mining. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:50:59
I haven't really been here that long, but this sub just seems more serious about making this crypto currency thing more widespread. So you see topics about this and that company or individual has supported or condemned bitcoin. I think this sub is so unfriendly to new folks because there are a ton of them. They set up and to field the influx of questions on those topics. 
Doge is happy and fun and new, but I think all these alt coins do the concept of a crypto currency a disservice.  Wouldn't it be better to agree on one and get people using it? Fix that one as we go? It's like we're watering down our own thing before it even gets out of the technological circles into the mainstream.  
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:02:15
It can only keep it stable up the limits of its range of motion, so you'd be wearing beer while the robit keeps an empty platform stable.
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:18:11
Nice! I hope this goes well for you OP. I also want to add that Go is one of the few games that remains unsolved; that is, computers are unable to predict the outcome of the game from any given move assuming perfect play from both players.  This also means that human players will consistently defeat a computer player. There's just way too many possible movement strategies with a 19x19 board. That's about all I know about Go!
OP, you have a drop-down for selecting currency. I don't see BTC on the list! Maybe this is just on mobile, but that would be useful.

They'd never be allowed to officially exist, but dang would this be cool.  It's on the content creators to not release it through a publisher (Louis CK style), many performers either don't care or can't afford the upfront cost associated with a self-publish.

Yeah, which is frankly a shame. Mining can be fun.

Are there opportunities for contributing to a bitcoin-promoting hackathon targeted at high school students?  I would contribute to that before anything simply meant to grab attention.  Getting some young students interested in computer science and cryptography would be extremely valuable, and would reflect positively on the bitcoin movement in general.
