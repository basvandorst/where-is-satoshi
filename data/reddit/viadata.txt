Yeah....that's why it was used as a store of value across many ancient civilizations and drove the value up even until the modern day. Because they knew that one day we'd invent electronics.

Ah - but that's the scam in a nutshell. Business owners accept and pay taxes with worthless bits of paper. If they don't they people with guns will come around to sort em put. It adds legitimacy to the whole thing - "see, it's not theft, we gave him the poop." 
Point is that it's merely a medium of exchange - and since you can compel people to accept your medium it's a great scam. Imagine if shitcoin authors could get away with forcing you to accept their shitcoin at gun point. You might as well use it - if everyone else is ALSO forced at gun point, then it's got real value. 
The actual tldr; All government and therefore fiat is just a particularly successful protection racket. That doesn't mean they don't do ANYTHING useful - I mean bikers do charity runs, Al Capone was very generous etc. Doesn't lend the whole scam any real moral authority though.

It has it. We hold. We laugh at FUD. We buy when the market bleeds and the noobs are screaming. This dip only looked bad, as there's been a ton of new money come in, who still think the media are honest and selling in a crash (other than to buy back lower) is ok.
Really we needed a good shakeout after that big bull run!
Just a normal week in cryptos, nothing to worry about. I'm richer again than I was yesterday with that lovely bargain sale. Hopefully you are too! Obvious market manipulation is obvious. 
 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:15:02
Yep. But here's the funny thing - you know a perfect buy signal as a consequence of this. As do I. So we can ALL just trade their moves. This doesn't help new people (they NEVER believe it) - but everyone who trades needs to learn how it works. I acquired a lot more yesterday,  so did a lot of people. They aren't getting that bit! 
When they dump, we buy. When they pump, we sell. Easy money. And then we hold, and remove more of their supply from the market.
We all know their games. That makes them very, very beatable as we can make them pay a premium for everything they get. These fuckers are used to fleecing terrified sheep - people who know their tactics aren't going to make good prey. And they keep pulling that shit, eventually enough of us will be able to put up a buy wall thick enough to soak it all up. Or when they try to cause FOMO, just sell into it and short. Stability through sheer bloody mindedness.

Yep. If I'm in the Mob, and I force everyone in my area to both pay their protection in Mobcoin and accept it in exchange for goods and services - it now has value equal to the productivity of the area. Not even Gold has much intrinsic value beyond its acceptance in trade.

Guys wearing patches representing their local chapter, who are armed and will take you to the local clubhouse to work you over if you don't comply? Kill you if you don't "respect" em enough?
Of course, apart from cops - bikers can be dicks too sometimes.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:55:11
Damn straight. It was just a good ol dump. Futures expiration, Goldman Sach opening trading soon etc....lotta big players had reasons to want to kick the market down and grab some deals. The bots pick up the movement and start laddering down until it hits the big buy walls at the trendline. Noobs freak out and sell. Old hands buy cheap coins, the dumping wales finish offloading into the buy orders, the bots and traders start buying back. Whales are happy and start slurping it all back up again. Business as usual resumes. 
I had fun and made money! Hoping that happens again, could make it like a monthly event where we all get to increase our net worth by a decent 25 to 50 percent. More for the really fast.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:00:19
Oh totally - they're bad at the scam.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:09:21
While that's true in the absolute sense - it's false in the relative sense.
If you own a shop, and I point a gun at your head and demand you accept the pile of poop in exchange for 30% of your profits - I think you'll discover rapidly that since you value your life more, you'll take the poop and be happy you got to keep 70%. Now that pile of poop is worth 30% of your business. If only you could convince someone else it had value as well, you've now got a poop based economy going. Poopcoin!
Tldr; Guns might not create intrinsic value out of nothing - but they really help. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:46:27
Not much really. It's just a soft metal that doesn't corrode - there's much better metals out for almost any conceivable ourpose.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:32:18
Yep! The US are the number 1 racket currently. I mean the various scammers have uneasy alliances at best - and if one bucks the will and profits of the big guns, down they go. Plus Venezuela pushed it too far - too much extortion and you just kill the Golden Goose (which is normally the issue with so-called socialist countries).

What you said applies to EVERY other asset though. Stock prices often diverge heavily from the performance of the company as an example. 
So yes, like any market, price is set by buyers and sellers. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:45:45
....you know, I've actually both answered that question so many times, and seen it answered so many times, I just can't be bothered.
Yes. A cryptographically secure &amp; immutable store of value incapable of being subverted via double spending and hyperinflationary polices created and sustained via electricity, with its price set by a global free market is a total scam. 
You should totally not buy in. Fiat money, backed by the good will &amp; happy thoughts of governments and central bankers, and the constant threat of violent coercian against the taxbase, with its constantly inflating supply and ability to be created out of bits of whatever worthless material happen to be around (or else just numbers in a bank ledger) is ABSOLUTELY the future.

Damn nice trade man, well done. I kicked myself for not getting in at the time. I actually started acquiring recently, suddenly my warning bells went off last week and I got out again (break even, yaaas) with my other recent positions. No regrets, it's a no-brainer hold, I'll just let the knife finish falling first. 
I'm tempted to Short, but I'm not a huge fan in case my analytics are wrong. REALLY bad sentiment analysis indications (Negative indicators, but with HODL style wording from WSJ and others - NOT good), the VIX horrors, the list goes on. Maybe tomorrow, if this is indeed a clear trend emerging (my Bot thinks S&amp;P is dropping by 20-25% after open which seems excessive perhaps.....this is a good test for my algo's). 
I'm thinking it's time for a big bleedout and tanking for forseeable future (ie a few months) - but my prediction error is too high for my comfort right now. I'm REALLY happy I'm long Gold....about ready to FOMO on the other metals. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:42:52


Markets are always a bit interdependent on one another. Go look at the Stock markets etc right now. It's a bloodbath. More than likely, the BTC and general Crypto crash was people getting into cash ASAP. This isn't about us crypto people. This is a MUCH bigger play going down.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:40:29
Once the Stock freefall ends, I'm going long on NVIDIA for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:27:29
Ikr? There's a lot of things I think are stupid - I'll still trade em to make money. Gold for example - it's just a dumb, shiny metal. Histories greatest ponzi IMO. I'm still long in it. 
Their whole insult is "Hur dur, butthurt coinerz, most of you made massive profits!!11!" 
Yeah......Ok guys. Great stuff - look how dumb we all are. Even if it went to 0 it's been a blast and I've made crazy profits.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:16:21
Yep it's not over yet! Depending on how open goes on wall street, it's short ALL the things time
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:23:01
So Ethpyramid? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:37:27


Ya know, I'm normally pretty damn bullish on all this.
But go an take a look at the other markets. This isn't so much "Bitcoin Crash" as it is an "Everything Crash". As a high risk, speculative asset class, it might take a while to really get things moving again.
Unless everyone suddenly decides to hedge against the DOW by going all-in. Fat chance though, I'd imagine Gold and friends will be safest. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:13:50
Not about price (although I think It'll go lower). It's about volume and consistency.
Once theres been a few consecutive days of growth, and vastly diminished sell volume I'm buying back. Same with the other markets. This isn't buy the dip time. It's wait for the knife to finish falling time.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:35:48


Today is a good day to figure more out about the current dynamics. Note taking day for anyone not long on $ROPE right now.


Of course, there's a caveat to that - most people in Cryptos aren't margined to the hilt (well....idiot kids who used student loans and credit cards aside). That 5% movement, esp on the backs of the XIV index losses today magnifies things. Plus Cryptos might be my favourite market - but it's just play money compared to the others. A LOT of potential for this 10 year equities bull run to finally end. We'll see.
