"I bought low actually"  
  
How low? Like yesterday?  
  
If you bought low, you wouldn't be selling but that's cool, I'll take your SATS :)

I mean, it can be whatever the user needs it to be...  
  
If the owner wants it to store funds in a decentralised manner, then why not?  
  
How about, stop gatekeeping people for the sake of wanting a say in things?

You can mitigate a lot of fees by using coinbase+GDAX together, there are plenty of tutorials for this within this subreddit or on the web.  
Coinbase is an easy to use on-ramp off-ramp for crypto-fiat and vice versa  
If you want to dip your toes in to alt coins, then exchanges are a great way to dabble in them
  
The sidebar has a lot of useful information also :)

Thanks for the heads up :)

I accumulated most of mine Q3 of 2017 and just left it in my ledger until about a week ago  
I'll have to check it out, see what's changed :)

Short term - who knows  
  
Long term - 10k is still very cheap

To piggy back this, what exchange did you use?

Bought low but somehow losing money?  
  
At least make a good lie about your holdings xD
