Segwit doesn't prevent the blockchain from clogging, it just allows more transactions to be packed into each block. It's more efficient.

I have a CBD shop that's launching in a couple days. I actually offer a 5% discount for paying with bitcoin. In the US, banks won't process credit card transactions for CBD companies, so I was forced to get an offshore account to accept Visa and Mastercard. Unfortunately they take 6% of each transaction as well as several other monthly/annual fees. I also had to go through a lengthy application process and make a lot of changes to my website before my company was approved. Bitcoin of course solves all these problems.

Jameson is so well spoken and concise. He never attacked bcash how Roger attacked bitcoin. All Roger could do was repeat how bitcoin is slow, expensive, and unreliable with no points to back up his claims.  Bitcoin might be expensive at the moment, but if you pay the price it will be fast and reliable. Roger is nothing but a salesman.

But you literally said that 990 sat/b was the minimum to get into the next block...

If you're asking if you can use a full node to process your own transactions, the answer is no. Nodes don't mine transactions, they just help the network.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:28:41
Sure, a lot of the transactions do sit there for days, but it's because they paid 50 sat/b or whatever. Transactions with a fee half the size of the one you paid were confirmed in the exact same block. You overpaid.

I can picture an episode with Roger Ver trying to sell them his bcash scam. He would get rekt. I can picture every shark asking, "How is this different from other cryptocurrencies? What's proprietary about this? Do you have any patents? What keeps someone else from doing the same thing and knocking you off?" Then he would give them the finger and shout about he's a millionaire. Then Mark would be like, "lol I'm a billionaire, bye Felicia."

$30 for a transaction fee won't even take hours, it would be confirmed in the next block. These people love to make up stories.

I'm using CryptoWoo, but I'm not sure if they support segwit. I only recently bought the license. I will note that they don't take a percentage of your sales like all the other plugins. It's a flat $29/year. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:14:00
Where did you get that data? Was it from a wallet fee estimator telling you what to pay? Or did you actually view the mempool for yourself to see what transactions were clearing?
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:02:57
No. Bcash has bigger blocks which does allow more transactions into each block. But it comes at a cost. It isn't more efficient, it's just bigger blocks. Segwit packs more transactions into blocks without increasing the block size.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:28:59
Those are valid points and you're probably right. A VPN service isn't selling anything tangible though. It's just a digital account, so the cost for them is next to nothing. I'm sure they can easily afford to refund a user's $8 that they spent on a VPN if the lightning payments somehow fails. They have very little risk here and a lot to gain from exposure.

@_date: 2017-12-30 17:28:10
You're right, it was factored in and most places don't give you a discount for paying cash, but some do. Either way, you're still paying an extra 3%. The merchant doesn't just eat those fees, they pass them along to the customer in the form of higher prices. My dry cleaner charges an additional 3% for using a card, so I pay cash. I also just had to pay the ATF a $200 tax for purchasing a suppressor, which I received a $7 discount on for paying cash. It may not be the norm now, but once bitcoin has some more scaling solutions, merchants will drop credit card payments because they are too costly.

I'm dealing with this same issue currently. I have a website that sells CBD extracts. While CBD is legal in the U.S., no banks will process transactions for my business. I'm having to jump through hoops to get an offshore account. And even once I have credit card processing, I'll be charged 6% for each transaction.

@_date: 2017-12-26 01:27:46
You must own bitcoin at the time of the fork in order to receive forked coins. If you sell bitcoin after the fork, you still have the forked coin as long as you still control the private keys.

The price of bcash is only 1 part of the equation. Most of us aren't selling for fiat, we are trading for more bitcoin. So in reality, it's the ratio that is important.

Did you batch your transactions? I just did the same with 10 wallets, but I batched all 10 into 1 transaction. It cost me $20 total, but it did take 2 days. I know $20 is still quite high, but it's definitely far from the $50 people claim to be paying.

I'm not sure. That being said, I did use it to generate segwit keys offline. I took the keys I generated and photoshopped the info onto the bitcoinpaperwallet.com template. bitcoinpaperwallet.com is good, but doesn't support segwit. I've transferred some small amounts to the wallets I generated, and the funds are still unspent. I hope that helps.

There a few ways bitcoin can be traced to you. If you purchase bitcoin using an account tied to your name, like Coinbase, then your bitcoin is obviously not anonymous. If you buy through localbitcoins using something like a cash deposit at a bank, your identity would remain unknown. Even buying on localbitcoins, your bitcoin can be traced to you if you use a computer tied to your real ip address. To get around this, run electrum through a vpn or tor. If you're really paranoid and don't want your isp knowing you're using tor, you can run tor on top of a vpn. This will hide your real ip address. Now, others can still view your transactions on the blockchain, but no one knows that those transactions belong to you.

Don't forgot about the data centers that process credit card transactions and all the employees required to work them.

When I say use a vpn/tor for electrum, I also meant while setting up an account on localbitcoins. I wasn't clear about that. If you bought on localbitcoins using a vpn/tor, then decided to purchase something with that same bitcoin also using a vpn/tor, no one would know who made that transaction unless you provided your name/address to the business you spent coins with. But yes, if you ever wanted to sell for fiat, your identity would be revealed.
