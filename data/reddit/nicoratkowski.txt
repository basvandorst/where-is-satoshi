Not to mention a corruption proof lawyer, which can sometimes be a tiny bit iffy

I get what you’re saying and I concede that I misspoke by saying it’s new. After I finished typing, I kind of realized that, for me, the major driver of holding bitcoin is tax treatment. If Bitcoin were treated as a currency and I don’t have to worry about capital gains / ordinary income, and I think the game changes significantly.

That’s fair. And of all the crypto assets, Bitcoin is, in my opinion, the closest to being a true currency. But I’m not sure that currency and assets necessarily need to be mutually exclusive (in the context of blockchain). Just because we haven’t seen it before, doesn’t mean it isn’t possible. 
The other thing about this, is that I think Litecoin makes more sense as a “currency” than bitcoin does just because of the increased transaction speeds. It works better from a currency use perspective. I’m fine with Bitcoin turning into digital gold that sometimes functions as money rather than having it be heavily used with less deflation. Especially since bitcoins volume issue can be fixed if its combined with traditional stock markets

Not so sure what’s wrong with the accumulation of deflationary assets. I understand that it’s not great for usage of an asset like bitcoin, but holding deflationary assets isn’t any different than holding real estate for 5 years before selling it at a higher price to a developer. Yeah, the land could have been used, but it’s lack of use isn’t necessarily a bad economic decision. 
Assuming Bitcoin ever gets put into an ETF, the hoarding effect will drive up price but it won’t eliminate use because Bitcoin can still continue to be used in extremely fractional amounts with no drop off in efficiency (assuming the network doesn’t clog)
The more interesting issue to me, is how many coins will be lost through death (and insufficient instructions to get the funds), lost passwords, etc.

The donations are tax deductible! HOWEVER, it’s worth noting that you will only benefit from a tax deduction if you itemize at year’s end (remember that the new standard deduction is $12,000 for single individuals this year). 
One of the major benefits of donating cryptos is that you do not recognize any gain on a direct transfer to a 501(c)(3) organization. This means if you got your bitcoins at $1k, you’re saving yourself the tax associated with a $9000-$10k gain AND you get to deduct the donated amount at FAIR MARKET VALUE.
