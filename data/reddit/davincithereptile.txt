I think yer missing one...
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:42:22
So you're of the opinion this person has some knowledge of what they're saying?
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:43:17
It's so frustrating because I bought my BTC on sunday evening. If I had had actual access to them, I could have sold at the high point (~800 per bitcoin) and made some money then rebought when it fell today. Sigh.
Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:33:34
Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:49:00
Then be sure to either make a new thread or update this one or both. Thanks so much.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:15:05
btce is the closest of the ones I checked.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:52:24
What a horribly put together article.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:30:13
So what is your prediction? Will it rise quite a bit in the next couple days, or will it have more 'flash crashes' and remain around the same/even go down by 100 or more?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:20:06
You're right I don't know because knowing is a 100% sort of thing. I'm speaking in terms of probability. Care to wager on my being right? :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:20:49
What time frame is that? Last night around midnight it was at $4.50.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:15:24
just when you think you've responded sarcastically to all the predictable SATAN posts you see another one at the top of the list.
how do I say this nicely: you're not original and PLEASE STOP.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:47:19
I think maybe that guy is a moron.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:33:50
Sorry what?
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:31:13
Yeah I just meant that if you invested in BTC's and got rich in them, then filed for bankruptcy, and debt you had would be forgiven, your credit would be ruined sure, but you'd have a fuckton of money in BTC...
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:45:57
see here
"If you choose instant account verification" etc.
They do it on paypal too. I was worried about this too until I found that FAQ and realized I had done it with paypal before.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:17:23
Everything? So don't invest everything... only invest the extra money you have laying around that you'd waste on some bullshit.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:51:23
So basically the message I'm receiving here is that you don't know what it means...
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:12:11
I ordered last night around midnight. I am still getting my buy for the market price that it told me at that point correct?
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:16:19
..that it's a big pooface?
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:47:50
I meant as far as making "since" but you meant sense.
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:23:40
Well the idea was that bitcoin can be anonymously owned and such.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:12:24
Please continue. Tell me more.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:14:47
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:04:37
It's a bot you can't reason with it. Report and downvote it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:14:07
Keep bitching at them.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:07:58
I find it hard to believe you've known since April and couldn't plan to have money ready to invest.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:17:07
Go on...
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:03:07
Past few hours have been stagnant. Maybe wait til you start to see some change and decide. Or just buy some now... That is my honest recommendation. All of that. Not any one part.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:18:40
Get back to me when you figure that out! I definitely want to invest in some altcoins in the near future!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:09:40
Fuck. I have no idea. Fuck...
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:16:05
me am smarted.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:14:34
well there's this... 
As far as people who know what they're talking about, lawyer up?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:15:42
my understanding of this argument is that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in circulation, and that amount divided by the amount of actual fiat in the world would lead to one bitcoin being worth hundreds of thousands. but that's just a very elementary and speculative understanding on my part. and obviously this would be years down the road.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:47:15
Contact their customer support and report back PLEASE. It seems likely that if this is something they are doing intentionally, it will only be for a short period.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:23:28
Yeah let me know when you figure it out. I think it's really hard if you live in the US.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:21:33
You can still team up in a free market...
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:35:46
No offense taken, I'm well aware of the risk I'm taking. I'm safe don't worry. Asking you these questions is my way of figuring out what I'm doing.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:16:50
Excellent answer, thank you. I don't know about being a day trader, I was as you say just hoping to buy some BTC and then watch the trend go up and make some money off that. Looks like I'll be using Coinbase! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:09:08
And the bars on the bottom?
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:14:58
Well what are you basing your standard on? Notice the disparity between buys and sells on all the exchange sites/graphs.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:05:44
Can you elaborate on weighted/unweighted? Still in the process of learning.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:47:00
I just want to make sure that I'm able to have access to the amount I ordered before there's some sort of bad crash ;[. thanks for the response.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:18:22
CPR eh... that's not on btc-e.com. There are definitely altcoins which are more valuable atm.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:41:58
soooo IS it going to be regulated...?
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:27:23
Could you pinpoint to me the history you're speaking of on the image you've given me?
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:10:04
umm sort of.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:15:50
Seems rather unrealistic....for some reason. You should elaborate and cite some sort of sources of past occurrences that indicate you could be right. That would be really nice.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:14:43
If the offer was for .5btc and that was the agreed upon amount then you owe him .5btc. Surely he had knowledge that the price was increasing and is expecting to get BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:12:49
My card is a Visa.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:17:26
What happened?
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:59:59
I'm just saying having it on pieces of paper isn't exactly the safest method when kids are involved. Obviously it's up to you. And again, I don't fully understand paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:41:23
If I had the money to do that I would also.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:44:16
Cool, thanks again!
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:19:48
You don't. You wait because it's going to keep going up.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:33:21
Thanks very much!
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:45:59
I wouldn't trust nieces or nephews that are that young, nor people who "have no idea what it is" with paper wallets... if I'm understanding paper wallets correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:17:54
Hmmm I don't know man. Ask support and report back.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:16:40
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:55:48
I remember when you posted this video about 20 minutes ago and nobody cared then either. Congrats.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:51:45
That's what I thought. Thanks. I'd personally be interested in getting into mining if it proves profitable in the long run... (obviously, as most would)
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:34:09
Thanks very much!
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:43:38
So could you explain to me why April is so important in your mind in the 2y graph? What does it imply? That a crash will be happening soon based on history?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:18:51
what happened?
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:40:06
Oh, I mean that I did the instant verification. My order is "pending" still. Just to be clear, I ordered about 8 and a half hours ago.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:46:47
Please! Give me good info as to why I shouldn't buy in right this moment!
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:43:41
op plz respond
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:55:42
Damn that is fucking awesome. What a lucky guy.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:02:29
Have you done it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:10:44
That's pretty intelligent. Invest in BTC and file bankruptcy...
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:32:27
If it went to $2 per coin I'd be spending hundreds more.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:01:05
Either way if it's just a small amount, you'd be kicking yourself in the future if it turned out it had grown by 5k, 10k, and had just said "oh well" when they got glue on their wallet or stepped on it or some other shit...
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:22:21
Actually it's really easy to believe because all the power he has was given to him by the people with money, i.e. the people with real power.
It's all a fucking spectacle. This guy knows it's his "job" to portray himself in a certain way and that's what he does. He plays pretend for a paycheck.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:36:32
Thanks man! I too did the instant purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:20:45
You don't have to invest 600 dollars.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:21:49
wuts that mean. whats happening in the picture ;[
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:28:16
Do go on. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:35:05
I think this thread should get lots of attention. This is good thinking by OP.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:01:14
Please tell us her reaction...
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:13:27
it's never too late for the same old tired crap
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:08:02
Yeah I saw some of those posts but when I searched it said those complaints were 7 months ago. so I thought maybe they had fixed whatever issues people were having with their site.
so I *shouldn't* use coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:49:07
Do you need employees to handle support requests...?
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:53:00
Aren't all BTC stored on networked computers? I'm confused.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:21:56
wtf... send it to me i'll take those coins... "not broke" plz 30k is a fucking ton of money.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:48:22
what's happening in this thread?
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:59:43
I wasn't being sarcastic.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:04:24
Thanks for this.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:28:09
I think I understand, could you elaborate a bit more? Is it that at each $100 mark people start selling because they see that as a sort of achievement, and since it just hit 4k in CNY many people using Chinese currency sold off all at once? They perhaps had programs waiting to sell at that point?
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:42:31
while I agree it would be fraud and it's deplorable, I fail to see how it's "obvious". I don't know shit about OP and it could be that they're correct in that it was a risk they were unwilling to take for one reason or another.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:59:51
It's not too late dude.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:53:46
Just learn your lesson for next time. Continually ask yourself "If I were me 3 years in the future what would I wish I had invested money in?" and do that.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:07:51
Don't get me wrong, that's cool and stuff, but it seems it would have been smarter to hold the bitcoins and continue to pay off the school however he was before. The bitcoins will be worth way more in the future...
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:40:46
anyone confirm doing this and getting some BTC post here
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:11:59
Just don't buy any until you can get them instantly to your account and keep the ones you bought previously. I also have some in coinbase and it's making me nervous but not a whole lot we can do right now other than bug them.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:49:59
Yeah I have a feeling like this too.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:26:48
It has happened a few times, it's just people selling large quantities at once which causes the mean price to go down (if I'm understanding this correctly). If you look at a 24hr period and then a 3day period on the graphs you can detect a pattern that shows small crashes every now and then and then big raises over a more extended period of time. 
Bottom line is don't panic.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:08:31
hahaha what a good and original post this was thanks for sharing bro. you're the first one to notice such a thing.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:02:36
yeah I bought some last night at like midnight and I'm still not getting any results. so uh I think I should be more worried than you...
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:05:02
Fiat is the general term for all regular currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:30:46
Elaborate for our sake Mr. Godspeed.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:31:17
Add BTC and you'll be relevant here...
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:18:03
It's just another small crash due to panic sells, it will go up to $750 per coin by the end of today.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:11:43
Someone earlier was making the point that it almost seems too good to be true that the government is being so accepting of this new form of currency...
I guess the answer is... don't invest too much money into it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:50:12
HEHEEH GUD 1 BRO UR SO CLEVAR
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:13:22
Yours is a common story. It's not too late to invest now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:04:06
holy fuck tl;dr please.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:13:20
Isn't that what we want...?
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:38:12
I want to understand what's going on @ that site...
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:16:59
Keep a close eye on litecoins.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:30:57
It depends what you want and what you theorize. Do you think the worth of BTC will go up? Just the other night it capped at $900 per BTC. Do you need all that USD or can you wait a while to see if it skyrockets more? 
As far as buying more at the current price, that's up to you. I'd say it wouldn't be harmful to sell off a couple thousand worth to live off and keep the rest for now.
