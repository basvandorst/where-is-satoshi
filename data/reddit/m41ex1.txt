In the last financial crisis there were runs on banks where people queued to get their cash out. In the next financial crisis it is important to know that many countries have made it LEGAL to “bail in” which involves taking a % of your bank balance instantly to recapitalise the banks balance sheet.
In this type of environment it is not difficult to surmise what direction the bitcoin price will go...

I really hope that my post doesn’t force you to leave this reddit for good, your positivity and charm would be sorely missed.
Perhaps let me add some context to my post. In 2013 all depositors at the bank of Cyprus with deposits over €100k had 37.5% of their assets confiscated overnight in a “bail in” to recapitalise the bank.  I believe this could set the precedent for future banking crises when our governments can no longer afford to be the lender of last resort.  My point is that money in the bank is not inherently safe which is often assumed, particularly if you have more than the guaranteed amount (varies by region).
The gold price appears to be blatantly manipulated, the FED will not allow any audit and it is quite possible that all the gold in ETF’s are not physically available or have been sold or lent several times over similar to the fractional reserve banking system.  My point is that people invest in gold in times of crisis and “owning” gold in a centralised digital ledger is not the same as physical gold in your own possession.
Storing your own keys to your wallet should be obvious to a person of your intellect but there a lot of noobs in this reddit who may not understand the difference between the wallet types and therefore may believe that when people say bitcoin is “unhackable” that their capital is safe.
You can preach all you want about the laws of possession and ownership but if someone steals your keys or an exchange is hacked the chances of you retrieving your coins are somewhere between slim and f**k all.  Please inform me of all the examples that bitcoin has been returned to their rightful owner.  Even the FBI agents steal your stolen coins!!
Your point regarding the bmw is not relevant, in most developed countries we have a robust legal system and mandatory insurance cover which means that the chances of total financial loss by the valeter nicking your wheels are almost zero.
Thank you for your contribution.

Litecoin was never marketed as bitcoin, bitcoin cash supporters believe in time their version will become bitcoin. For a new investor it's worrying that they might invest in the wrong one, which surely will slow up investment on the original chain.

Yes of course but if your bitcoin v2 gets significant mining power, publicity and economic viability then you dilute the strength of the original chain.

You shouldn't really take advice from people on Reddit on altcoins, they will only recommend the coins they own. 
Think of the other coins as having much higher volatility, so if you are comfortable with higher risk and are investing an amount you can afford to lose then why not?
Most of the altcoins have seen huge gains in last 12 months so sticking a small amount in a few different coins could see massive gains if you are willing to invest long term. 
Do a huge amount of research before investing, a poorly informed investor and his money are soon parted.

Easy, maybe he was a saver living with his parents before he got married. His wife is a spender, they are now renting so cashflow is tighter and it can be difficult to save when one of you’re used to spending everything they earn on a monthly basis, i see that all the time. $6k is not a lot of money and could have easily been saved or gifted. 
The only thing unusual about this situation is that he was lucky enough to find out or be told about bitcoin in its early years.

I’m familiar with compound interest, Einstein said it was the 8th wonder of the world. I also like it. What I’m suggesting is that statistically the number of day traders that actually make money over the mid to long term is very low, and all but a very small percentage (single digit) make consistent returns. Most people would therefore be better with just buy and hold.
1% per day consistent returns is a fallacy, unless
you’re involved with bitconeeeeeect! (Which is a Ponzi scheme promising returns that are impossible due to the very nature of compound interest which you appear to be a self proclaimed expert)
Edit: usually the only day traders that make consistent returns are the charlatans that give courses on how to day trade. Looking at your post history, you are offering tutorials on how to day trade...there’s a surprise!

I believe the question “is bitcoin in a bubble?” can be measured as an inverse correlation of the soundness of fiat currency and the fiscal responsibility of the governments and central banks around the world.
Those fuckers are being reckless with the debasement of our life savings and the savings of our parents.
On this measure there is a long way to go. Once you see the life savings of a significant amount of the worlds population invested In bitcoin (which is trillions) we can start talking about bitcoin being in a bubble.

Agreed. Btc will never be replaced. Bch has some advantages over btc but there are 1000 other coins that can do the same as bch, I honestly don’t know what the fuss is about, bch just another alt, not to say there is no value in Alts but btc is the first and most widely adopted crypto, it will be exceptionally difficult to dislodge that regardless of high fees

There is around 16 million approx. in circulation at the moment, with more being introduced every 10 minutes at a rate that is predetermined.

My main point is that bitcoin and other cryptos can shelter your wealth from indebted governments, bitcoin is seemingly easier to monitor now but it's evolution is still in progress, privacy can be obtained.

Can you clarify what you mean when you say technology cured the inflation problem? Thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:58:58
The euro is already splitting at the seams, I think it has been a failure. Sharing a  currency  across varying economic countries prevents the currency from finding a level which is optimal for the individual country. Germany needs a stronger currency but some of the peripheral countries need a weaker currency in order to remain competitive.
Then there's the whole my debt is your debt, which is basically Germany's  debt. Fiscal budgeting goes out the window as the other countries in the bloc are expected to pick up the tab.
It's a disaster waiting to happen if you ask me.
But desperate times... wouldn't surprise me if you are right

I've only listed a few examples, there are dozens of articles showing governments are trying to limit the use of cash globally.

Governments may indeed create their own crypto but it would look so similar to their current fiat  system you wouldn't know the difference.

I agree but my point is many people are 100% sure it’s not Craig Wright but there is more than a 0% chance it’s him.

Ps. Sorry to hear about the toes...you should get that checked out mate ��
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:19:07
The community doesn’t want Craig wright to be SN. whether he is or not remains to be seen.
He has stated he is SN But in a way that makes most people have doubts (by not providing 100% conclusive evidence) perhaps that was his intention so that it’s ambiguous.
If Satoshi isn’t Craig wright and he is still alive you would think he would provide proof that he wasn’t Craig like he did with Dorian.

The current system in many countries allows you to become bankrupt without facing criminal charges and the debt to be wiped clean. The debtor is then likely to be able to get credit again after a predetermined time (eg. 5 years) 
This is one of the reasons banks are so scared of crypto, no one can access your coins without your keys.
It is of course entirely irresponsible for the individual to take these actions but it is similar to a prisoners dilemma

If we are talking about its performance in a global, debt fuelled monetary crisis then it's likely to rise by 10x not fall to 10% which is one of the reasons to hodl

Bill gates put all his eggs in one basket. When Microsoft was growing into a million dollar company he didn't go out and diversify he stuck to what was working. Diversification is a great strategy for balancing risk but by definition isn't the fastest way to grow your wealth.
