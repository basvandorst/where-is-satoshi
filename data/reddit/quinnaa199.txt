I be got 1 buddy who got me into crypto.   People are dumb and don't want to listen.   I've pretty much quit talking to people about it.   They will learn the hard way.   And quite possibly have a life time of regret.  And every time they think of it.  They will become sick to the stomach.  At least I hope so haha

I remember my first bet with Tommy in 3rd grade.   I bet Tommy a pack of gushers he couldnt do a backflip off the monkey bars.  He climbed up there and sure as fuck he jumped and started but never finished his flip.  He snapped his spine in half.  Wheelchair for life.    But I'll tell ya.   Those gushers never tasted so sweet

Yea the i o t sector isn't big at all.   Volkwagon, audi, Bosch, fujitsu, believe in a shit coin.  Yea and it being quantum resistant doesn't mean anything.   It's build into it's architecture not just build on top of it.  Micro transactions with zero fees.   tell me more about how you know nothing about this sapce.

if it's not bitcoin you all say shit coin.   I own bitcoin.   it could very easily be the MySpace of the crypto world.  or maybe the gold standard.   the Facebook's twitter and Instagram are being made now.   quantum computing is going to make the block boys sweat hard next couple years.

Every time you use your credit or debit card the bank gets a piece.   On credit purchases the owner pays the fee.  eliminate this and small business can make more money/ hire more help
