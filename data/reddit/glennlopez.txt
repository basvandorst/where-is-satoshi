Im not understanding something about the blockchain that someone needs to explain... what stops anyone from just selling the private key to an unsuspecting person for money instead of doing a transaction on the blockchain? How can selling a private key with $1,000,000 worth of btc for $900,000 to an unsuspecting victim in cash be traceable?

How could they leak something they never knew was going on?
If you have NSA agents apply for openings in the company (SEIMENS, ATMEL etc.) to find a vulnerability in engineering, testing, and manufacturing of PLCs and etc, an agent could find weaknesses in manufacturing (an opportunity) and inject government backdoors into the product that everyone uses without anyone ever knowing.
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:03:16

finally got a ledger wallet but it seems like its a step backwards from what I usually used (blockchain.info) in terms of security. Yes I have to trust 3rd party with my private keys but its unlikel that blockchain will gox its users considering most import bip encrypted keys into blockchain.
To me blockchain.info is more secure. I have my passcode (not just 4 numbers like ledger wallet) + Yubikey to login + email confirmation when logging in from new devices.
and to send btc, you need to be logged in + confirm the transaction with a 2nd password before sending. 
Ledger wallet seems too vulnerable when compared to blockchain + yubikey 
correct me if im wrong

I highly recommend Brain Wallets. Its completely decentralized so even in the event that you decide to cryogenically pause your life till year 3010 when your 3 BTC is worth 1.8 million dollars, you still have access to your funds in the future without having to rely on software that may not even be supported in that era.
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:43:11
Unless you plan on storing more than 100BTC I suggest something simple first like Coinbase or Blockchain.info wallets. Otherwise using device dependent wallets that store your private keys in your phone just over complicates everything for anyone new to bitcoin and how private and public keys work.
Once you know what you're doing, switch to Ledger Wallet. Remember, its easy to lose your phone and dealing with manual backups are inconvenient, not to mention... opens you to vulnerability attacks if you have no clue what you're doing.
As a merchant I recommend QuadrigaCX. They have a feature that autosells your bitcoin when you recieve or send to an autosell address. I use the feature when receiving anything less than 1 btc. No need to deal with btc volatility as a merchant.

meh. people are already using btc for remittance esp in iran. in canada, iranians cannot send remittances (gov wont let them) so they just send bitcoin to their family. its faster, cheaper, and easier than how its "legaly" done.

as far as illegal wages... theres tons of that going on in darknet markets already. and don't forget, trump is a man who wants to abolish encryption. he clearly has no clue what hes talking about and is just throwing out unicorn promises as he thinks them up.

Please do not take this personally but considering how the Philippines (like India and Columbia and many other hot tourist destinations) are full of scammers (especially agency scams), how can this service be trusted?

The fact that it takes more than 5 seconds for Mycelium app to confirm the chip via NFC and my unreliable state of hand movements during this process while holding the card behind the phone is the issue, not the device itself.

**To answer your question:**
Reverse engineering a smartcard is more expensive and more effort to do (requires an intelligent + well rounded + skilful individual to do). Reverse engineering a micro controller far less expensive, far less demanding. But at the end of the day, **the weakest link in security is always the human behind the screen**. 
My point is: **Sometimes, its the implementation that matters the most, not the technology behind the secure element**.
I have both and trust trezor more. How the smartcard is implemented in Ledger Wallet is great, but its still vulnerable to social engineering and other human factors. The Trezor... is not (100% guarantee).
**How I use Trezor and Ledger Unplugged/Nano:**
Ledger Nano: Stored in the safe as a backup for ledger unplugged
Ledger Unplugged: In my wallet | For spending and receiving 
Trezor: Used to sign withdrawals from multiple HD wallets (essentially a safe for my bitcoin via 50+ different seeds which include decoys upon decoys upon decoys &lt;-- something you can't do with the Ledger Wallet)

I like to use bitcoins volatility as a coupon. 1 btc is bought at $230USD and loaded into the card when it hits $260:1btc (for example). After, I create another order for 1btc at $230 at my exchange and wait till my order is met and only load btc into prepaid card when the price for btc is highter than when it was bought.
Also being canadian.. If I purchase a USD prepaid CC, I can buy btc in CAD and load that btc into my prepaid CC for USD ---thus, skipping the whole exchange rate bullshit altogether.

nope (no issue with personalizing via fidesmo app). I believe the issue is Mycelium app or atleast how ledger unplugged is handled in mycelium during a transaction signing via nfc. I have no idea how this works so my thinking is purely intuition. I guess the app needs an uninterrupted connection during the signing for the card to work, so the more your card slides during this process the more likely you'll get an error. Fidesmo card would be more reliable if the induction loop inside the card were tighter and concentrated in the center of the card rather than the outside of the card (again, speaking intuition.. I have no background in Telecoms engineering).
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:03:18
I thought transaction history was sourced from the blockchain ledger. Also I thought Mycelium only restored its own HD wallets and not from Ledger Wallet or Trezor as these HW wallets were imported and not part of the backup Mycelium does.
As far as I know, if you make a backup in Mycelium app, it backs up only the Coinapult and Mycelium HD seed.
My concern is not leaking the address as this is available for everyone to see already. My concern is having an address identifiable through Mycelium if Mycelium keeps logs on which device is tied to a Mycelium HD through import.

there's a wallet app by blockchain.info that does what you're looking for. You open up the menu, select merchant directory and it opens a map for you with all stores, and atms that accept bitcoin in your area. As far as exchanges goes, no idea what exchange does what you're asking for.
It's probably better having such feature on a wallet app vs a website since anyway. Go check out the app. look for blockchain bitcoin wallet. I'm sure other wallets have the same feature.

I got an idea.. send me 0.04BTC (1LdS8TjaXGBy5oiQYJmEPV682UmrPgfufe) and I will try it then let you know if its a scam.

I suggest using Mycelium + Ledger wallet or Trezor combo. You need to have a microcontroller or smartcard sign your transactions for you outside of your smartphone to protect from malware.
As an added layer of protection from snoopers in the future, mycelium connects via TOR to anonymise your transaction broadcasts to the blockchain via mycelium network. Mycelium app has support for both trezor and Ledger wallet.

localbitcoin can be a pain in the as but completely anon. good for laundering money if thats why you don't want to be identified. If you just don't want to go through the hassle of providing 3rd party exchange your ID and Bank statement for verification (paranoid)... try using:
- 
- and if you're canadian try 
FYI: You'll be using online interact with the above choice.

**"A passerby could take a picture and post it to a forum. A user of that forum could send funds directly to that beggar, using the picture as the only piece of necessary information to make the transaction."**
be careful though... in the future, scammers will just change the qr-code using photoshop and post the photo on your behalf without your permission on your hacked twitter account

Yes. Prepaid CC is one of the best ways to protect yourself from carders. Bitcoin deposits make depositing funds into your card instantly faster vs the old way. 
Best of all, your roomate can "split" the cost of that new xbox (half way around the world) by sending you bitcoins into your "e-coin btc address" while you wait in line.

Not sure if this will work but have you tried using VPN? 
- Use a VPN to fund your account with BTC
- Deposit 0.25 btc to test the water
- Get a skypax.com account and forward your card to the UK which mails it to your home in the land of the free
- spend using prepaid

lol or maybe... the gov. don't need to "confiscate" anything. they just need to create fake deepweb silkroad-like market place where people can exchange bitcoin for illicit drugs, drive its reputation up then run off with everyones bitcoin thus "damaging" bitcoins rep / driving down value of bitcoin and peoples trust in using deepweb market places while auctioning "confiscated" bitcoins to fund national surveillance agency.

its the same reason EMV cards cannot be cloned. If you remember back in 2001-2008 directv had issues with Canadians buying the dish + receiver then "cloning" a USA subscribers information into the chip to get free satellite channels.

don't use a free vpn, if you cannot afford a vpn use poormans vpn (SSH tunnelling - buy a raspberry pi and SSH into it to use your home internet anytime you use public wifi).

I had a different problem. My 2FA wasn't working, so I went to grab the backup 2FA device in my safe. They were outputting the same 6 digit. Couldn't withdraw anything couldnt even change my password. If you are reading this, get your btc out of btcjam and do a background check of your credit. BTCJam is not to be trusted anymore.
Way too much "technical issues".

Reverse engineering cant help you retrieve the private key, but it can be a weak point to which a hacker can use to gain your trust towards a compromised device. 
In otherwords, reverse engineering can help facilitate a social engineering attack.. which is how most high profile attacks happen.
