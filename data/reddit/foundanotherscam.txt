because they dont produce their own miners. they just produce the "box" in which the miner gets stored.
they have to buy the miners at a markup from someone else..
if you want to invest in cryptos then just buy some bitcoin and hold them for a year

Sorry but even this client is not "the bitcoin"
you can always develop your own full client. In fact we would need one as this one is very slow sometimes, especially the database..
Also iam sure that less then 30% of the user use this client.
and BTW on your  link are like 70 different contributors? that looks really decentralized though

not FIAT but the usdollar. The euro is increasing in value:)
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:24:43
if you forget the change for example you can lose your coins.
you wouldnt be the first person :D
you can inspect a raw transcaction on coinb.in though before you submit it to the network to check if you didnt go a mistake

Thats not true. tether has a account on kraken with a  hundred million usd. so if you sell your tether on kraken you get usd from tether directly. they fund the trades on kraken

where is it written on their website?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:44:55
you could use  for example to do a transaction
 click on new -&gt; transaction
enter the public adress  and create the transaction
then click on sign  -&gt; paste the transaction and paste your private key to sign it
then click on broadcast
you can use this site also offline it doenst need internet. you can do it on a safe computer but if you already have the private key on your computer it seems like your pc doenst have any virus or privkey stealer
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:17:29
YOu probably deleted the wallet.dat and thats where the private key is stored in
you should be able to recover the file

just dont do it. maybe it will break after  2  years and thats not a long lifetime. a laptop should last much longer
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:41:09
just abandon the tx from your client and balance will be normal. I think the tx didnt get submitted as its not valid

for europe bitstamp is very reliable and good
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:06:29
I think you wont find a seller in Dubai. You have to use bank transfer and use one of the big exchanges

you can give B the private key to the bitcoin. this information wont be public and he can use it to start the transaction on his own
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:18:15
are you sure that he lost the money? maybe he is lying? OR maybe he lost the money from bad trades
ask him for a police report and police statement.
ask him for proofs. Ask him for a proof of the withdrawal from the exchange etc.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:19:24
also ask for the forex exchange withdraws and proofs
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:34:21
They didnt release a wallet or source code yet so you cant get your coins right now.
also no exchange accepts deposit so its impossible to trade them
you can see updates here

there are many more forks right now, but most didnt release a wallet yet

@_date: 2018-01-02 12:04:46
I think it will lead to problems if you travel with for example 30,000 us dolllar in cash everytime
You could make a bank account in a european country for example and then sent the money each time with online banking and use the european bank account + a exchange to buy the  bitcoins.
 
For this you need to travel to europe one time and open the bank account.
After you have a open bank account you  could just do a international bank wire from south koreah and when the money arrives you deposit it to some online exchange -&gt; buy the bitcoin -&gt; and deposit the sale revenue to your south korea bank account. then international bank wire the money again to your account...
Its not allowed to enter the european union with more then 10,000 euro in cash
 
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:34:45
is this visa or mastercard? There is no information given lol. this card looks useless if its not visa or master
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:12:58
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:46:44
well you can just try it and sent 0.000001 btc towards that adress.   Or just post it here and someone else will sent you some dust
if it shows up on the blockexporer  you can be sure that it wasnt loaded before.
I only think the casascius coins were loaded with coins when they were sold. all other brands were sold empty
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:39:08
In which country do you live?
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:36:16
Of course you can create a bank account as a foreigner. You have to be in the country though i think and in person at the bank.
Also possible that you need a registered adress,  so you might have to rent a room on airbnb or somewhere else for a few weeks until everything is done.
If you have european money, (EURO) you can deposit it into the account. Also if its cash.
But remember that it is only allowed to  bring a maximum of 10k€ in cash into the european union.
some banks have atm machine or a teller to deposit cash into the bank account.
But in the long term I think you will only be in the EU 1 time to open the bank account. AFterwards you could just to  do international bank wires to fund the account everytime.
Step1: bankwire from SK to EU Bank account
Step2:  online banking bank wire form EU Bank account to bitstamp (exchange)
step3: Buy bitcoins on bitstamp
step4: withdraw btc from bitstamp and sent them to your south korean exchange
step5: stell the btc and withdraw the money to your  SK bank account
step6: see step1
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:31:12
this means that everytime you buy this btc the price of btc goes up.
and you claim to have an unlimited supply of USD?  hahaha at some point 1 btc will cost more then all usd in existance if you keep buying the bitcoin
either you are retarted or  a shill

Just buy btc and but them on a damn cold or paper wallet
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:55:36
no this is not true. more miners cannot confirm more transactions
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:28:30
your bitcoins are still in your wallet and in your adress until the tx can get confirmed.
you can double spent the btc at any given time
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:55:14
no, they would need to spam much more then since the tx are smaller and also the fees are supposed to get high from the spam.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:37:12
Just keep the coins on coinbase until they add segwit.. sent a support request and ask for segwit
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:30:34
its simple logic that whoever spams the tx will run out of money

Invessting 100$ per Week is the best thing you can do. This will cost-average the purchase price.  You should continue buying bitcoin for many years. Its very reasonable to say that bitcoin will hit 100.000 USDOllar per Coin very soon. All my friends working at goldman sachs said so
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:54:39
it has nothing to do with the currency as its the funding of the exchange
i dont recommend you to buy any other currency then bitcoin, all the others are scams to find stupid investors.
stay with bitcoin and you are safe
bitcoin as a investment is per se already highly speculative and risky. why increase that risk by 1000x times and invest into some altcoin ?
with lightning and the 2nd and 3rd layer solutions that are coming very fast for bitcoin all other altcoins have no more value/usage reasons
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:44:04
Why should I get paid in FIAT and then buy BTC if I could just get paid in btc?

Just wait a few months, you dont get rich within days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:32
the mempool can only be spammed because 1 miner controls 30-40% and  benefits from his own spam
if the mining would be more decentralized it wouldnt be such a big issue
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:40:26
they didnt sell it yet but are going to sell it next week. this will drop bitcoin cash very hard
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:36:08
I wont make a blog or anything. If you want to know if I succeed just make a remindme! and check the bitcoin price again in 5 yrs.

credit card payments always comes with fees, normally the merchant eat up the fees from the profit. 
with bitcoins this is not possible as the marketplace cannot charge you a 0.25% trading comission but pay 4-5 % for the credit card transaction
you have to pay the fee or  use bank wire to fund your account
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:21:12
no since its a valid and paid for transaction
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:20:57
why are you lying and spreading  wrong information?
Just look at 
you can clearly see that the  1000+, 700+,  500+ tx all got eaten up
its slowly going down and even the tx with  300+ sat/b got almost all eaten up  and are reaching 200 sat/b transactions

Bitcoin is the original idea and concept.
Every idiot in this world can create a altcoin.. altcoins are scam
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:27:53
so you are claiming that we only need 1 mb? then why bcrash switched to 8mb? oh yes because now they can use asicboost again, which was blocked by segwit on  bitcoin.
asicboost is a exploit used by jihan vu to mine 20% faster  and to exploit a bug. no wonder he is pushing his own altcoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:52:26
it was in a wrong context sorry.
Someone said what iam gonna do if bitcoin drops in value.
And  I said that the same can happen if you get paid in USD and the usd drops in value;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:25:26
you can sell them immediately
the 10k limit is for the bank withdraw,, the withdraw will take time but u will have the USD already in your exchange account on coinbase for expl.

sell them;) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:38:36
Do you get paid by Roger Ver or Jihan Wu? I think they also pay you in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:35:58
then you have to pay tax on the profit you made  in the trades
its only tax free if you Buy Coin1 for  X and sell it after 12 months for more.
If you buy  Bitcoin for 100€ and sell trade it for litecoin you would pay tax if the bitcoin was more woth then 100 on the point of sale to litecoin. if it still was only worth 100 there wouldnt be any profit.
if you keep this litecoin then for more then 12 months you can sell the litecoin afterwards tax free

@_date: 2017-12-21 10:18:53
bitstamp is very good and stable
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:27:41
Yes, I dont drive a 50k US Dollar car and I dont have a high lifestyle.
 I have enaugh USD in my bank account to pay my bills for the next 5 years.
I would never in my life buy a tesla or anything else expensive. I rather  donate it to the united nation world food programme
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:38:31
I think starblock is on testnet 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:58:00
lol just read wikipedia on bitcoin or some other basic informations
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:12:51
you can see existing messages in the blockchain on this website
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:18:43
it will empty, its a matter of physics of the world. the attack alias spammer does not have enaugh bitcoin to continue the spam forever, as the supply of bitcoin is limited and they cant be artificial created
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:56:17
the blockchain already is the archive
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:50:56
how can you spent the same penny forever? I think you are clearly stupid
every spam costs a small number of bitcoin as a tx fee, and this is forever gone as it goes to the miner...
so at one point you will run out of money to pay the tx fee
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:38:33
sell your bcash as long as the price is high :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:50:34
the labels are something else a label is a label like the names says, its not the adress
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:55:19
broadcast the tx again maybe to more nodes
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:34:52
Sorry? Where does history say that? Check the last 2 bitcoin bubbles that we had in the last years. Even if I would have bought at each bubble  all time high, I would still have more money now then less
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:25:04
I dont live from payroll to payroll so i can easily afford to pay my bills.
Well if there is a crash I will buy into the dip. The risk of getting the salary in bitcoin is the same risk as buying bitcoins directly.
I never said that 100% of my savings are in bitcoins. I also have usdollars in my bank account.  God bless america
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:50:05
buy a old dell laptop for 100-200 USD and remove the wifi/bluetooth card from the  device.
setup cold wallet there and backup the keys on a usb drive thats secured with truecrypt or veracrypt
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:55:04
yes you can invest once a month for a few years and see your value rising quickly:)

sorry, my bad
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:49:06
it truly depends on the attack. if the attack/spammer doesnt stop it will never go through. He will run out of budget at anytime and stop the spam
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:36:44
Thank you! I think Roger Ver is also paying many shills in bitcoin. I can smell their postings here.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:20:28
Well I thinks its better to get paid in BTC and to pay expenses with USD, The USD is less worth then btc and should be spent preferable.  Who wants to hold this shit usd?
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:03:53
Make a Information page that warns users about common scams in the bitcoin word, for example bitcoin cash!
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:02:57
you must prove how/where  you bought it and more important  HOW did you make/get the money to buy the coins
if this was illegal money or crash from illegal activity you cant prove it
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:54:29
everyone  can rebroadcast a transaction that was once in the mempool
you can however double spent it

you coud  add wrong data in that blockchain... not very good

You are only 14 and wont need the money until at least you are 18.
by the time you are 18 - you will be a usd millionaire. just keep holding and invest more whenever you can :)

So far every US president had his own war or play area. Trump needs one too. the us economy is built  on consumer products and war.

there are only 21 million bitcoins, so at somepoint the user doesnt have anymore coins to spam
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:11:43
no correlation found
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:43:00
You can sent with low fees aswell.
Fees are only high because the block chain gets spammed by some bad guy that is also paying a public relation agency to mouth bitcoin bad
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:21:20
Well I could also buy bitcoins from my salary bi-weekly and buy within a dip.
Getting his salary  in bitcoin will in long-term stabilize the bitcoin price. I am willing to pay in order to make bitcoin stable. I dont care about money in life. Money is not important.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:10:54
you are spreading lies to support a wrong propaganda
are you a paid shill by roger ver?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:33:10
yes that is 1 advantage  about bigger blocks, but unfortunately there are much more and worse disadvantages. so its not worth it
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:43
did users also get credited their bcash from the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:44:56
no the HR  managed that. I just asked for my salary to be paid in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:20:46
why is QR dead? qr  can  be used
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:04:30
Why? This requires more works and more steps. Its just much more easy to get the bitcoins directly as a salary

German citizens have the best position currently, all crypto gains are tax free if you hold the coin for at least 1 year and didnt sell or trade it in that time period :)
you can just sell it on any exchange and withraw the € to your bank  account
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:59:48
Who is paying you for the shilling? is this your online job?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:24:25
this depends on the laws of your home country and has nothing to do with germany
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:38:13
you are delusional
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:48:01
You can still be happy to have a salary of 530 euro per months.
If germany didnt pressure europe to create the  Euro currency you would still have the greek currency and earn a equivalent of 150 us dollar  per month.
greek was never a rich country, because the people there are lazy
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:53:06
What kind of answer to you expect? You are trading and of course you have to keep a spreadsheet with your profits/losses to  calculate the taxes
The government wont do a calculation for you, you are old enaugh. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:28:33
yes this is must youve done. question is where you got the adresse from in the  first place
are the coins still on that adress? then  you need to find out know where you got them from
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:22:31
I dont need a tesla, i rather drive a cheap 5K USD car and donate the saved money to  the united nation world food programme

@_date: 2017-12-02 06:40:49
If you want to buy in the crash or dip you should already sent the USD to the exchange so that its ready and available when you want to buy.
Sometimes you only have  1 day to buy into the  crash, because others are waiting for the same;)
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:35:20
you dont need to be a hacker, everyone can read the blockchain and see the transactions

but if we only want to store the same transaction history that is beeing stored now then we dont need  8 mb blocks as it all is already storeds and fits inside the existing chain..
your arguments make no sense and are just there to confuse others
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:21:38
I dont care about money and dont need much to life. I would buy bitcoins anyways, so why not get them directly?
@_date: 2019-11-21 14:53:41
dont sell your claim towars them. its a private company which buys creditor claims.
just play the long game and wait your return will be much higher then
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:04:14
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:58:00
Bitcoin is a store of value and many users are using it for such purpose
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:45:13
Ich würde an deiner stelle bei bitstamp kaufen. Bitstamp ist eine echte Börste während bitcoin.de quasi nur ein vermittler zwischen käufer und verkäufer ist.
bei bitcoin.de überweist du das geld direkt an den verkäufer während du es bei bitstamp  an die börse überweist
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:44:49
i recommend you to wait until it drops
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:41:34
but then you dont get us dollars but tethers?  how can you convert  the tethers to $ in your bank account?
If you cant, then who would seriously take them?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:20:52
just do it
but  wait for a correction/dip and then buy but  get the loan ready and the money on the exchange in advance
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:54:46
so you are sayin the endgame solution is LN ? well then bitcoin is going the right path
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:22:03
Are you sure that 2013 already hat  password protection?
just download the old software version
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:48:11
So this means you can only hold tethers or bitcoin but never get your usdollars? Then i dont understand why anyone would hold tethers
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:20:58
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:26:52
Wow maybe this is what also happend to gox?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:44:23
Can you withdraw the coins from the exchange? If not then you dont own them yet
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:27:24
Seriously? What are you going to do if bitcoin crashes ? Living on the streets in berlin for the next years?
Dont invest money that you cant afford to loose
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:59:59
and why are we at the limit of 1mb blocks? because someone is spamming the network...  use  your brain who this is
2 cents are too high for large parts of the worlds? so are 8mb blocks because the  internet there is too slow..
the solution is lightning and segwith with 1mb blocks
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:19:47
post the tx
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:48:22
if fiat currency diminishes from our world then there is only bitcoin in existence and as you get your salary in btc you also have to use  it to buy daily needs.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:02:15
sell  now and wait until it crashes 20% or more. it  will correct itself sooner or later
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:25:57
 as you are a european citizen i recommend you  to go with bitstamp
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:50:02
It is another spam  attack

@_date: 2017-11-27 21:47:59
try another browser
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:38:42
if your initial TX never got confirmed it means that the coins are still YOURS.
you can just make a new tx and sent them somewhere else with a big higher fee then the previous one.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:38

@_date: 2017-11-30 20:57:08
The transaction was reversed  due to an error? are you sure that you  bought the coins? Maybe the order got canceld?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:14:25
he probably didnt want to give his private keys to someone  "working" in the jail
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:48:04
some are going to panic sell and others are unable to get money to the exchanges until monday/tuesday
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:18:59
No it wont, it will still go into the chain but  in a bundle with other transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:55:26
You should  try to invest 50-100 dollar every month for the next years
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:07:37
I dont understand your request.
Do you want to buy 500-1000 BTC ? Then the best place would be an exchange like gdax or bitstamp.
The factory doesnt exist, there are only miners and  they are also selling on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:09:32
bitstamp is the best.
you open an account there and transfer money with sepa bank wire. then you can buy on their plattform
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:15:40

sell it now and buy back at the next dip/mini crash.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:28:24
they do this to protectt themself from money that came from hacked bank accounts or fraudulent activity.
How can they be sure that your husband agreed to this transaction?

your bank account can be seized but bitcoin cant.
iam willing to bet that you cannot sent it instantly around the word. maybe only bank intern

Bcash is actually not faster nor cheaper
its a myth to get investors into that coin
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:11:48
Sure thats why there are already houses hold in btc
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:27:18
even 9k is a great entry point.
i think it will never go so cheap again. 8k is unreachable
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:47:10
Please give bitcoin some stability and re-invest at least 1 million USD after it crashes/corrects itself;)
you owe it to bitcoin to help it being stable.
you can cash out this 1 million after the drop/correction stopped and it grew in value again.
Repeat the process every few years when there is a "bubble"
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:59:59
There is lightning and some other off-chain transaction services in development. Just wait. The bitcoin that is in development can handle unlimited number of transactions

google VPN and learn how to avoid the censorship ;)
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:50:28
I recommend you to already store the us dollar on the exchange, so that you can buy quickly and without limits when it drops.
A correction should be coming soon where you would be able to get a 20 to 30 % discount on the coins
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:00:46
open the wallet.dat with a hex file reader.
you might see the seed or even the adresses and privkeys

its better to buy a old  dell laptop or buy at least a seperate HDD and switch them everytime.
I mean physical switching the HDD.

I would get the loan and buy the coins as quickly as possible.
dont invest more then you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:51:14
it will drop by 1k before it bounces back to 8k
i saw it already in  my vision
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:41:11

dont worry about inter-plantery bitcoin networks

Its possible to double spent the  coins. Dont worry
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:40:34
Only take the loan if you are able to pay it off in the next  4 years even if you lose all of the money.

@_date: 2017-11-26 20:58:16
I would wait until it drops or has some 20% mini crash.
 just wait 1 or 2 months

What? Your screenshot says that you withdrew 2.02931784 BTC from coinbase and this is also the amount that you received  in your kucoin wallet 18PsEQm6HWNKX16n7HRoKme6MpuLoz6CPJ
Why did you say that you sent 2.10679394 btc? on the screenshot you sent 2.0293
the remaining bitcoin in that transaction arent yours but coinbase and its their will what their do with it or where they sent it
So how come that you say that you lost 0.0774761 BTC ? you balance got deduced by 2.02931784 and not by 2.10679394 
@_date: 2018-03-20 05:38:44

How realistic is it that everyone on earth will use bitcoin + the  Lightning network?

Why was that guy actually a scammer? He asked for a donation and asking for a donation is not scamming? Since the other person knows its a "donation".
I think that Neil Murphy, from Belfast scammed the person. They did a deal ( do this for this) and the other guy did his part but Neil Murphy did not pay up for his promisis.
so Neil Murphy  from belfast is actually the scammer here. he owns this guy money. this guy did the work for him(aka dress as a racoon)

And you dont remember how much you wanted to withdraw in the first place?..
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:13:19
No it doenst skip bitcoin.
You can imagine LN like this.
Iam sending you 0.1 BTC today, but instead of pushiing it to the blockchain iam giiving you the transaction and the control over the keys.
every 2 days now iam sending you another 0.1 btc and we are doing the same.
after 1 month we decide to stop and you submit all of these transaction thhe blockchain.
however you could also submit them after 2 or 4 days. this are still bitcoin transactions that we just decide to do without the blockchain to  make it faster and better. we can however push them at anytime to the blockchain to settle. even without the settlement you immediately own the bitcoins and dont need a confirmation

yes you can just open a bank account and cash out here.  However since you are not a german citizen you would still have to declare the income in your country and tax it

@_date: 2018-04-02 20:40:36

@_date: 2018-04-01 01:56:33
yes the mining algorithm maybe but not the algorithm to create the address and private key
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:09:08
yes this is just part of bcash propaganda.
you dont need to use LN and as long as nobody spams the blockchain transactions will even be cheap on-chain
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:14:35
Ok lets get this stright: How do you know that the blockchain header has only 4 bytes for the header?
If you read the whitepaper you would know that the block header has a unsigned integer for the timestamp and therefor it will run until ~ 2090. as only than all bytes will be overflown
so your 4 byte claim is false
