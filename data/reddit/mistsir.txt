Nobody is forcing you to use eBay. They are free to be one of the few people so far to accept bitcoin. They will probably cash them out as soon as they get them, though, just like other merchants.

At least you can dispute any transaction, as opposed to bitcoin where what's done is done. You can also request a new card if its lost or stolen, but if your private key is stolen, you can bet your money is gone. Just be objective.

He explains that man has always spent their time creating things to do work more efficiently. Money is one of those things. Bitcoin is certainly the next step, but just like they said, not everyone uses AOL anymore. Not everyone searches with AltaVista. People will always be moving on to more efficient ways of doing things. Bitcoin has as much intrinsic value as Litecoin or Dogecoin, and the fact that Dogecoin even exists should wake you up to see the flaws of the design. Bitcoin has some good ideas, but since its whole selling point is liquidity and low fee transactions, it will never be on par with legal currency.
It's a virtual commodity, and if the only selling points are freedom from government tender and fast, low fee transactions, there will certainly be something to come along that does it even better. *And that's okay.* This is how we evolve, we throw things against the wall and see what sticks, the only difference is what sticks the longest. If markets take bitcoins from you and sell them immediately for USD, that isn't believing in bitcoin. That is appealing to a niche demographic. What sense does it make to buy bitcoin with USD, pay someone with those bitcoins, then they transfer it back to USD? The bottom line is that it returns to the currency we still have. As long as people have the desire to convert it back into USD, we are not dealing with an ironclad system. We will eventually, but bitcoin isn't it.

Okay, but imagine there was a company, much like Paypal, that could do these same things with the dollars you currently have? Currently a person will take USD to BTC to BTC to AUD. *In theory* a global currency could work, but is it necessary? There will still be differences in value of BTC, won't there? For example, USD and CAD(Canadian Dollar) are practically the same. However, there are different taxes and services depending on each country that must be taken into consideration, such as free healthcare, or lack thereof.
The fact that the value is the convenience and low fees is not something that will be unique to bitcoin, its just a matter of other companies catching up.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:00:51
This seems like circular logic. Or at least, it requires a reason why its valuable. I understand all the "intrinsic value arguments", but I don't think they are posed the correct way. What value does bitcoin *really* have besides it being inflated and having an arbitrary difficultly level?
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:34:42
I believe you will be given $300 worth of bitcoins at the current rate on Friday. I bought a small amount on Sunday where was no notice about this, so I am patiently waiting to see at what rate I will receive.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:38:09
That sounds like a good method, at least once coinbase is stable. I suppose the day that it becomes an instant transaction from fiat to bitcoin is the day it will legitimize and people will see the value. For now, I guess early adopters have to deal with all the issues that accompany a new idea.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:27:12
I understand that, but for all the security measures you have to go through to safeguard your virtual currency, it seems that it all leads back to having something in the physical world. The USD is a Federal Reserve note, which is the only place that prints authentic USD, by law. Bitcoin may ask some serious questions about the value of money, period, but I question its ability to have staying power.

Earning is always funny to see when talking about investing, but I suppose its putting your faith behind something, so you must have done *some* work to profit. You would want to store your wealth somewhere it would be safe, but nowhere is 100% safe, especially in further investments. Tough question to answer, but I suppose having something tangible (paper wallet) would give you more peace of mind if you had a way of guaranteeing security. More money, more problems.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:26:49
[Don't know why]( but I'm not complaining. Maybe some faucet that I forgot about.

Paper wallets seem like a false comfort to me, but I'll look into encrypting. I feel as if having it in an ominous cloud somewhere doesn't do much for my peace of mind.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:31:38
There is *some* information available, but to really know you have to do exactly what you did to learn about it, and while those are the struggles you will make as an early adopter, it must be made easier for the world to understand.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:27:15
I wouldn't say people don't understand the time and the risk, they just wouldn't want to take the time or the risk. You may become filthy rich or you may have nothing. I'd say the chances are higher that you will have nothing, but I guess time will tell. I can't trust something so volatile with sites shutting down left and right (hear about mcxNOW?). It's simply laughable, its burning out of control, and I think people just can't keep up with it.
Again though, we'll wait and see.

Fair analogy, but the difficulty of mining is arbitrary, as can be seen by altcoins. What makes bitcoin more valuable than litecoin? That it was here first?
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:32:33
It doesn't show up on blockchain.info :\
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:51:46
The only answer is whoever makes the biggest profit margin. This person can belong to any and all parts of bitcoin. It is also very flexible and depending on your financial status and your ability to invest.
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:18:21
Yeah sorry, don't know how i missed that. I think people were too excited to see a price drop to let it stay that low.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:49:19
1) Your online banking account will timeout.
2)You can dispute charges.
3)It's incredibly easy to go from your wallet to *any* address.
There's a lot of bitterness in this thread, and about bitcoin in general, a real "I'll go make my own currency! You'll see!" feel. They have a right to mock it. Maybe once/if Bitcoin gets to a respectable level of acceptance they will be more respectful, but as of right now, its a volatile market with a bad history of shadiness and no protection of if you make a mistake.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:26:38
Have fun paying those taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:07:03
That's good to know, I haven't heard much of BTC-e. Thank you.
EDIT: Registered with them to see they have very limited options of getting USD to them. Options are: Interkassa.com, Payeer.com, Perfect Money, OKPay EgoPay, and International Wire Transfer with a minimum of $500, something possible Czech, Ecoin, and Epese.
Now if I wasn't looking to send $500 to the czech republic or use some service I've never heard of before, where am I to look?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:24:58
I guess it does bring a good amount of conspiracy with it. Of course bitcoin can only be so powerful in the electronic state. It's basically a currency for people who not only have electricity (and being able to afford an abundant amount if mining) but an internet connection as well. The more I see it grow, the more I can see it living side by side with fiat currency as a commodity.
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:32:48
Go down? What, $7?
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:19:11
Well I imagine you could make your own educated guess from that list. You can imagine many of those 0 - 0.001 are accounts made on sites with cashouts that people never redeemed and the like. So less than 1 million? At least of people with any substance to their holdings.

Great, guess I'll check in the morning. Thanks for the help, I'll probably update in the morning.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:24:38
It depends on publicity and acceptance. It could be a very successful tool in the world and not reach the astronomical prices people expect, or it could do just that. If its accessible, people will use it. That being said:
$1000 steady by Q1 2014
...And that's all the speculation I can do without just amusing myself. It all depends on the adaption rate, and the internet *does* make things faster, so you could witness the life and death of bitcoin (fading into obscurity) in a matter of years. This lays the groundwork, someone will perfect it. Good things its open source.

There is a lot of circlejerking on this subreddit, but you should understand by now that the value of bitcoin is much higher than its true value. There is a lot of speculation and hope put into bitcoin, but easy come, easy go. Be prepared to see a correction that will put it back on track with steady growth with where it was 2 months ago, before all this hype.
It's natural growing pains.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:53:04
At that point, does bitcoin(AltaVista) devalue completely? Why invest in something that clearly is missing these important aspects?
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:15:23
Okay, so its just as protected as your email or your computer, if you decide to lock your computer. How about if your hard drive fails? If your back up flash drive fails? I understand the concept of the paper wallet, but that just begs the question, why not regular currency instead?
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:06:24

@_date: 2013-11-25 06:48:38
Its always amusing to me when people kick themselves for not buying. Its a gamble. Can you really see your past self investing $1000 at $10/btc? Just measure the risk and hope for the best. Never spend more than you can afford. Or let it all ride and see what happens, its up to you, that's the fun part.

This is a big issue, all "revolutionary" and "$900/coin!" aside. If its going to be taken seriously, the people need access to and from bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-19 19:20:28
This is very informative, though people may pass it by if because its a 20+ minute video. He makes a good point of if you are mining, from a tax standpoint, you are better off selling and then rebuying, so that $150 btc is taxed instead of that future rate.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:05:29

I want all of my bitcoin transactions to end with thank you please.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:32:17
I see. When I check out the "Raw Transaction" part of Transaction Details (in Multibit), it lists a long string of "from [exception: Script did not match expected form:" and some numbers. I just had this wallet on a different computer and brought it over, though I wouldn't think that would matter.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:40:21
I can manage that. I guess I (and many people) would like some peace of mind in where they hold their money.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:13:46
Seems advisable to not panic sell anyway, but I think the main draw of coinbase is there aren't many other good options out there. Are you really going to trust MtGox? Bitstamp? BTC-E? BTC-E might not be bad but getting funds directly to them is a struggle, and I'd rather stick with one service. So, you can understand why Coinbase has been having these issues.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:52:32
Very fascinating to read, thank you for digging it up. 2009 wasn't very long ago, but in internet years it sure seems like it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:32:07
Fair enough. I think the fact that there is absolutely no turning back on a purchase unless the recipient feels like it is maybe too harsh. The fact that these purchases are anonymous, too, seems to help the shady behavior. One of the selling points of bitcoin seems to be that you don't need to trust the stranger you're dealing with, or at least you don't need as much trust in the grand scheme of using bitcoin. I think you need more trust than ever.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:03:23
Nobody would entertain that analogy.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:30:02
I'd feel a lot more comfortable if I were able to link a bank account or at least have the option of a debit card purchase. I suppose this is something that will just have to wait.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:28:10
The way it seems to me, bitcoin is definitely in its infant stages. People are tentative about every aspect of it. People sit on their coins and rejoice when the price rises for someone else has bought into it to, probably, sit on it and hope for profit. I think the market it saturated with these people, so much so there's not enough people actually spending to balance out the amount of people who are just waiting to be millionaires.
This is why I think the value will fall. There are many good things about bitcoin, but I have a hard time getting people to look at it objectively. So, you can go to Subway and buy a footlong for .005btc ($5 as of 11/26/2013 3:15pm EST). What does that do for you? How often are you sending money to mongolians? It makes me feel like its just some hip way to pay for things, but its worse than that, you have to live with the regret and the anxiety of "did I make a good purchase? let me check the ticker again...
What about 3 months down the line? Let's say bitcoin is up to $2000/btc for some arbitrary reason. You effectively paid double for any purchase you had made, so you're more inclined to just sit and wait and spend your USD. A currency that nobody uses to buy things with *will* fail.
Bitcoin is a novel idea. I could be wrong and every government in the world backs Bitcoin as gold 2.0. Or I could be right. The only thing ironclad about Bitcoin is the arbitrary difficulty set by someone. Yes, it gets more difficult, yes, there will only ever be 21 million. What is the value, though? Is it valuable because its burning resources(electricity)? What sort of logic is that?
These all may not be good questions, but they are the questions that arise, and when the time comes, they need an answer, otherwise Bitcoin loses its value.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:06:35

To me it seems like Coinbase is our last bastion, as an American user. Can't use MtGox, can't use BTC-E for anything under $500 with a *wire transfer*. We need more options that accept american bank accounts if people are going to stay with this. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:37:51
Are you saying btc-e is good for quick and easy buying and selling, that it can be used in a moment like when BTC hit 900 and everyone wanted to make a quick buck?
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:02:19
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:01:25
It's been said over and over that coinbase isn't a good option for buying like you're at the stock market. If you want that, mtgox. While it's unacceptable for the service to simply go down, I'd say it goes with the growing pains of bitcoin as a whole. Either they will adapt or become irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:31:20
So that's to say after the first confirmation, it will definitely *eventually* get there?
