I would think it would be the value of whatever your bought at that particular time. So say you have 10 mBitcoin that you previously bought for $5, and you now buy a t-shirt that the retailer otherwise sells for $10 and you pay 10 mBitcoin, then the value of bitcoin for calculating your capital gains is $100/Bitcoin. So you have gains of $5 that you have to pay capital gains on.

You may profit in USD terms, but you are at a loss in BTC terms. You won't gain back what you could have gained in USD if you had just bought BTC with the USD that you paid for the miners. 
Eg. You buy $1000 worth of usb block eruptors 6 months ago. They have made you 1.5 btc in return total since you started mining. And you sell the btc that it's given you. At this point you get ~$1450 for the 1.5 btc. Where if you had bought btc instead of block eruptors 6 months ago you would have had ~9 btc which at this point you could sell for ~$8100. SO while you're still in profit $450, and you'll keep making money. You would have made MORE money if you had just bought btc instead of block eruptors. 
You may think this is being greedy but I personally feel that bitcoin is my base currency so if I'm not getting a return in BTC with something then there's no point. Although I buy an asic every now and then to help support the network, but I don't delude myself into thinking I'm profiting in BTC (Though in USD you/I very well may be in profit)

by hashing, the solution to the problem can't be changed. It can be verified very easily but it can't be reproduced without a lot of work. 
If the message is "Attack tomorrow" and they do the hashing work and the solution has to be 0000XXXXXXX (Where X means any number) it takes work to find something to append to "Attack tomorrow" that will hash to 0000XXXXXXX . If a man in the middle (or traitor general) changes the message to "Attack today" it takes work to calculate the new something to append that gives a 0000XXXXXXX hash. So by the time they've found something that gives a 0000XXXXXXX hash the other generals might have moved on to the next block. Also if he's the only one that's a traitor the others will be solving blocks faster. 
Hence the concept of a 51% attack.

what would be cool is if you could load up your google account with like .01 bitcoin and then if you want to skip an ad on a video you can choose to pay .00005 bitcoin, so like between 5 and 10 cents. That way google gets the revenue (which is what's important to them) and then the youtube video maker could either get a cut off that or you could also choose to tip the video maker.

Time cost of money. Bitcoin are worth more with a quicker access rate than a slow access rate. There's a premium for getting coins quicker, because even though you may be paying a bit more for them right now, if you wait a week to get approved on an exchange the price will have moved up and you might as well have bought before.

@_date: 2013-12-04 01:03:10
actually I think it's more than will ever exist. Because the protocol stops giving rewards once they are halved and the decimal is less than the amount of precision that it has, aka miner reward is 1 satoshi and then it gets halved. so you end up with 20999999.999999999 (count my decimal places?) bitcoins produced ever. and even if you add decimal places to the protocol it just makes it 20999999.99999999999999999999 so you'll never actually reach the 21million bitcoins lol

yes it is taxed. I trade currencies on forex and I have to pay taxes on my profits.....
at least here in Canada I do.
The better rebuttle would be that taxes on income ( as are the taxes in question here) could very well become a thing of the past with bitcoin, and instead we could see higher propery and other types of taxes to levvy the cashflow lost from the lack of income taxes from bitcoin.
I'm not saying taxes are gonna dissapear (remember the only two certanties are death and taxes) only that you will begin to see different taxes being applied, Taxes that can be tracked better (I understand it's relatively easy to track payments on the blockchain but if you use a mixing service of some sort it could be sufficiently pseudonymous for avoiding taxes)

Litecoin, 2.5 minute confirmation. 
I thought the whole argument for it as silver to bitcoin's gold was bullshit because you can just move decimal places so the 4x extra coins are essentially pointless. After buying a few things with bitcoin and seeing how long it takes to get 6 confirmations and having already done a bunch of litecoin transactions it's really amazing how much quicker it is.

that's funny because it also makes it have more potential or at least less of a jump because they'd be more used to doing cashless transactions. Just gotta wait till more things are being done in bitcoin (eg. wages, buying groceries, etc.)

@_date: 2013-07-16 20:30:56
not sure how to link to another subreddit so I'll just put the link up 
If you read the post and the comments, there's some speculation (along with math and whatnot) that it's less than 24 litecoin confirmations to equal 6 bitcoin confirmations.  I used 6 confirmations as a reference becasue that's what's taken by both the bitcoin-qt and the litecoin-qt as well as the exchanges I do business with as an approved transaction. 
Also I never said that faster confirmations means less time for equivalent security. 
no need for a holier than thou attitude.

bitfinex has access to multiple order books,
I think...
Also the reason mtgox prices are higher is because people can't get money out through USD, so they have to buy bitcoins to transfer money out. This creates an artificial demand.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:11:05
Only thing I'd say is to diversify a bit. keep $40,000 in bitcoin, and put another $10,000 into other things, namely alternate cryptos so maybe litecoin or others, some into gold some into silver. 
Diversification is the key.
And like other people said. Invest some of it into the cryptocoin marketplace! Spend a bit of it, maybe donate to charities you like through bitcoin. This gets the ball rolling on the adoption of cryptos.
and for heavens sake get your bitcoins OUT OF THE EXCHANGE!!!!!!!

I'm not sure how that works, wasn't around back then.
Is it the wallet's own network that says ok this guy sent .1 bitcoin to this other guy and that's it?
Does it get broadcast to the bitcoin network?
Is it like a bitcoin debit card system (not that there'd be an actual card but in that you deposit some bitcoins and the online wallet's own network handles it's own transactions internally)

That's why it's important to properly diversify :) I believe bitcoin is a good alternative and provides benefits, but people shouldn't rely solely on bitcoin to hold their wealth. To that same effect people shouldn't rely solely on gold, nor silver, nor any other asset as a sole store of wealth. They should hold diversify across different assets.

I would think so, they probably have a business bank account with one bank and they transfer from there.
I think the novelty of this payment processor is that they also support litecoin. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 14:16:29
yeah, I agree that standing for 2.5 minutes at a till at the grocery store or something would be pretty awkward, but it's likely less awkward then 10 minutes. I think stores or restaurants might want to do some sort of modified checkout routine, like those self service automatic checkouts. Maybe have the checkouts around the store inside and you can check out, keep looking around the store then when it confirms you just walk out. 
I think the 2.5 minute confirmation times would be good for food type places. Where the process would be:
1. Order
2. Pay
3. they cook your food (which you have to wait a few minutes anyways)
4. It confirms while you're JUST getting your food or eating it
5. you can leave tips without confirmations because it's not necessary for your payment.
This process could work very well with either bitcoin or litecoin.

For bitcoin I doubt they'd be profitable, they MAY be profitable for scrypt mining (namely litecoin) especially if you don't sell them off right away and let them appreciate over time they may be worth something. Realistically for bitcoin it's probably a wiser investment to just straight up buy some.

I suppose if something like that happened there would be an emergence of a new crypto or some crypto that doesn't use the encryption scheme that bitcoin uses (which is why it's good to have a variety of cryptos) will rise up as the new one.

I'd think so, though considering this is a secondary market (so not directly listed on the stock market) this isn't as big as it might seem. I'm not sure how big the trading volumes are for Second market but it's still probably a pretty substantial amount, and it paves the way for the winklevoss' real ETF
