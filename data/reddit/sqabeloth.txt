It's more like an industry that is being pushed by the extreme left who then profits by using government contracts and bailout money to foist green technology on people when the market hasn't called for it. Solyndra anyone? The bottom line is they had used the term global warming for decades up until recently and now use climate change so they can't lose if we have a colder than normal winter/cooler than average summer or vice versa. There's record sea ice peaks in Antarctica these days ya know. That said, I have a high regards for MIT and their undergrad mission of expanding Bitcoin into those students' lives.

I can't expect OP to be well researched, after all, he does have to keep up his pace of 10 posts in 15 minutes..
"Bitcoin was introduced to a very small corner of the world on November 1 2008, as an email from a previously unknown Satoshi Nakamoto to the metzdowd.com cryptography mailing list."
That was the bitcoin paper:

I really wish one of those things takes off. Bitcoin either needs large amounts of wealth being parked in it (savings, long term holdings) or large sums of money being transacted with the help of it.

Is that a joke? what is this? is it a currency or a course of learning laguages?

When Senator receive all these letters he will be shocked, I'm not sure if he get the point of the problem but the fact that so many people writing letters are not satisfied with the present situation will push him to revise it.

$17,000? That's very expensive. You'd probably be better off just using that money to buy bitcoins and hodling them instead.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:28:33
I would say it was a blow to the foundation, but nothing at all to bitcoin.

Bitcoin doesn't have enough liquidity to be the currency that oil trades in, nor does it have a large enough market cap.
....Maybe in a few years though
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:44:04
Bitcoin doesn't give a shit.

What stops you from saying that you lost $3000 from volatility? maybe embarrassed because of a failure
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:53:15
 If there are large amounts of oil being traded with the help of bitcoin, the demand for it, be it only as a trading instrument, rises significantly.
