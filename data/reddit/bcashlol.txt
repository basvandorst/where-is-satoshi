Because a true decentralized project can't be regulated
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:18:25
Yeah they are lying. How to prove? Check the blockchain for your transaction.
 The miner fee is different than what they have on the app and there's a change amount that goes to some address we don't own. Gdax is nice for the low price of Bitcoin compared to other exchanges and can be fee less of you deposit from bank and set an order limit. I think Abra is a good price for being able to use your amex. For instant buys abra is better than coinbase. But if depositing from a bank, which takes like 3-5 days for me, gdax is superior.

I've used both. And samourai is way more functional than mycelium. And looks better. It is the standard for mobile wallets imo.

Do you have a Bitcoin node synced? Because even on good hardware (despite using a mech hard drive since my SSD doesn't have space for it) it takes awhile to verify. Smart contracts are eh for me. Block chain has no way of enforcing data external to the block chain. It requires oracles for that which pay a human to input data. Very gamable
Xmr is cool but has it's own issues as well. Bitcoin has been working on it's privacy and once everyone uses bitcoin, xmr isn't needed since xmr is good at the moment to sever identification from exchanges,ATM, etc from Bitcoin addresses.

Yes. I believe blockchain tech is blockchain tech. Might as well build on the one with most developers, most users, and most security. Also I believe even if all the governments in the world work together, high unlikely, they would still not be able to control a decentralized project like Bitcoin. Sure they can print money and buy Bitcoin, but they can no longer take control of the printing machine nor governance of consensus.

As others have said each transaction generates a New receive address. So to the blockchain they are linked to your private key, which no one knows but hard to track using a block explorer.
Also you can have near infinite accounts. With the same private key or different private key. These won't appear to be linked together without the private key.
You can wash Bitcoin from your identity by trading xmr on one exchange like shapeshift and then trading for Bitcoin on another such as xmr.to.
You can buy Bitcoin without Id by trading for cash in person. 
I don't understand why you think you have privacy with the current system, which they have absolute Dominion over. They track you more effectively than if you were using Bitcoin to it's most private potential.

It's like if you want to pay your friend and your neighbor in one transaction, you pay one fee. So for example one input then into 3 outputs: friend, neighbor, your change. Batching helps with exchanges so instead of sending one by one they send to all in one go.
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:44:15

Because that single address can break funds up to single utxo and send to himself thousands of times, or even convert to monero and back, and it would be an order of magnitude harder to track. There's a website that has every single Bitcoin address and it's corresponding private key. But it's impossible to cross reference(so you can search) ones that have bitcoin in them. And besides how can a gov know the difference between sending to someone else and sending to yourself?
Also Bitcoin shapeshift to monero. And monero using xmr.to back to Bitcoin breaks any identity link.

How can one tell which is the right Bitcoin chain? Satoshi intended that we can't trust each other but we can trust the most accumulated hashrate would be the right Bitcoin. You'd know this if you understood the white paper in it's entirety and not just the title.
What's stopping a bcash minority chain fork from being the real bcash? It has like 1 user and thus orders of magnitude less hashpower.
How can bch be peer to peer if you can't run a full node since , not storage space, bandwidth doesn't increase nor get cheaper. When bch experiences user adoption like bitcoin only data centers can host the chain.

No. I'm saying in this open source environment, good ideas get implemented into Bitcoin. And nano is faster than bitcoins base layer since it has a central trusted node aka a central authority like PayPal or the systems we have now. The trilemma of crypto is decentralized, security, scalability. Only two can be had for the base layer. 
Energy consumption isn't a negative factor for Bitcoin. Mining profitability is heavily weighted toward lowerig energy costs than producing more hashes. So mining companies set up shop near energy production where they can't store 100% of the energy, and so Bitcoin mining uses the energy that was going to be wasted regardless. 
Again I don't want to discount any coins and be an ignorant Bitcoin maximalist. I like researching just in case there is actually a Bitcoin competitor. Right now I haven't really seen any. I just don't understand nanos advantage? It's feeless or so low in fees that in can, and should be spammed. If it was low and free then why not? Send backups and entire seasons of shows to be stored forever by everyone running a node. That's why the central coordinator is needed. To protect from such spam. I feel like the argument is that nano just needs so many nodes that a coordinator isn't needed. But that's just a blanket promise. What if a natural disaster shuts down a large percentage of nodes? Won't it be an opportunity to attack the network? Bitcoin was revolutionary in that even when it was in it's infancy, it's more profitable to play the rules than to attack.

If there's a Central point to sue then that is not decentralized enough. The entire point is decentralization. No central party cares if Bitcoin got taken advantage of by PayPal. The tech is permisionless and can be used by anyone who wants to use it. This coin seems like it has an owner or owners since they want to be able to control their project.

Pre mined, centralized shitcoin. What's the point without decentralization? A lot of trust to the central coordinator. They say it can be done to remove the coordinator if you know how, but if it can be done then remove it altogether. If iota can be attacked without a central trusted party then iota is not a good solution. Bitcoin couldn't have been attacked when it was first mined by computers because it was always and will be more profitable to act honestly than to attack the network.

No the faucet didn't distribute them all over the world. It was like one South American country. And how does anyone know that it was truly distributed like that? The dev can totally lie and say he did. And regardless why must it be premined and given through faucets? Why can't users mine for it. Nano distribution was not fair. It selected certain, if the dev even truly gave then out and not to his own wallets, people over others. Bitcoin was the most fair when it first started. Who did Satoshi choose who would get the new currency? He wasn't like okay I'll mine without anyone knowing and I'll give it to redheads. He was like whoever wants Bitcoin for free, take it! 
And no Bitcoin will compete with credit cards and apple pay. Nano has no advantage over Bitcoin. If nano did have something truly revolutionary, the devs can code it in. And if it can't without significantly breaking consensus rules, users rather upgrade to new Bitcoin rules and keep their money and network than to start over by upgrading to an entirely new network. No alt will ever over take Bitcoin because of this.

I think I can explain it. Full Nodes are the synced bloclchain. The ledger file that we all share. When you don't run a full node you rely on someone else's full node. So ideally you should use a full node as your wallet or use a wallet that let's you reference your own full node.
Lightning network works in a peer to peer way. So (starting with 1 Bitcoin for all) a payment from Bob to Alice, through Carrol since they don't have a channel open to each other but have a channel with carrol would look like : Bob and Carrol sign in a multisig transaction that Bob has 0 Bitcoin and Carrol has 2 Bitcoin, while Carrol simultaneously signs a multisig transaction with Alice with one that states Carrol has 1 Bitcoin and Alice has 2 Bitcoin. For the overall effect of Bob has 0, Carrol has 1, and Alice has 2.
 Have you ever signed a transaction offline and then pushed it to the network? Say you use an offline computer or a hardware wallet. The signing offline and exchanging these transactions is what 2nd layer is. It's signing a multisig offline in a peer to peer (to peer to peer to peer etc if not directly connected) and then submitting to the Bitcoin network later. The difference is you must commit the Bitcoin on chain first, so that they can't be spent by you after you signed them to someone else. 
Disclaimer: Not a Dev or anything but this is my understanding of how lightning works.

Miners don't hold power over changing consensus rules. They serve the users or they don't get paid. Decentralization means you are able to have a copy of the bitcoin ledger instead of trusting one central ledger.

@_date: 2018-06-10 11:40:09
No, not trolling. Just saying Bitcoin is decentralized because the ledger is stored on many computers. Miners get to write transactions into the blockchain by using energy, which must be paid back to the electricity company by selling the token. Miners work for the users in that they mine the profitable chain. Miners don't control the network. They merely work by ordering transactions. One of the reasons why segwit2x failed (was canceled) even with 90% hashrate support was because it didn't have user support. Of course segwit2x was going to fail if it wasn't called out because of the poor code that resulted in an integer overflow.
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:02:30
There won't be a death spiral on the Bitcoin chain. Difficulty decreases for miners to be profitable again.

Miners merely order transactions and produce a block. They get paid if they do the work. They can't change consensus rules. They are not a central authority that controls the network. See segwit2x. Bitcoin is decentralized in that many copies of the block chain exists and not in one central location.

I'm good. Don't feel like updating my node. Let us know the block height so I can sell the airdrop.
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:01:46
Anyone know any wallets that can set fees total? Can't do 1/(input size) to send 1 sat total. But like if there's room I should be able to send 1 sat total fees right? Never know when that sat can buy a pizza slice is all.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:21:58
That just means you don't understand it yet.
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:14:21
I wish there were more zeros. And I can't send 1 sat total fees. Maybe a wallet issue? And it would be nice not to be blockchain analyzed but it's a tradeoff and things are in the works for that.

Nah that same attack was to be done on segwit2x. They would lose money and Bitcoin users can move to another hash algorithm, making their Asics worthless. Remember no one is using bcash since their blocks have 50 kb worth of transactions.

That's not accounting for difficulty adjustment which would increase if you add more hashrate. That also doesn't account for selling because of electricity costs.
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:48:33
Both have average 10 min block times. If you can get a merchant to give you something with zero confirmations, double spends shouldn't be easier than the other. Remember, in a decentralized environment you don't know which transaction came first. The merchant may see one thing but I, on the other side of Earth, may see something else. However, both of us can come to consensus which transaction came first when it's in a block.

Bitcoin cash has has less aggregate hashpower than bitcoi, thus by Satoshi's definition is not bitcoin. Also segwit didn't break consensus rules so it is still valid rules, so it is Bitcoin. You can send Bitcoin from a segwit account to Satoshi's Bitcoin account. How come you can't send Bitcoin cash to Satoshi's Genesis address and have Bitcoin show up? Because it broke consensus rules. Bcash added Eda and changed block size, invalid rules since it is the minority chain.

Bitcoin core is a reference client for Bitcoin. Like bitcoinabc is the reference client for bcash. 
But what if people dont want loans. They just want to save? Banks won't be needed as much when more people can secure their own money, send their own money, and would rather save their money than to take out loans. Sure loans can still be a thing, but it won't be as big as it is today. Banks would have died without being bailed out. They will die with proper competition.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:58:23
The one with the most accumulated hashpower gets to be called Bitcoin. And hashpower follows prices. And price comes from the users who use it. So people agree to the consensus of what is called Bitcoin. Most likely there will be three chains in your scenario. The third chain would do nothing. And most likely people don't upgrade because they need time to verify the changes. So the status quo remains Bitcoin in cases of such contention.

Get a wallet. Write down seed ( private keys that allow you to send the bits. Don't give away). Copy receive address. Give customer recieve address. Don't send items until transaction has confirmed.

You need savers and spenders. However savers are more important than spenders. You can spend a currency that others only want to save with but you can’t save in a currency others only want to spend with.

Ethereum is not immutable! They rolled back a transaction that was valid, nothing wrong with the network except a central authority didn't like it so hardforked. They didn't have majority consensus since most people didn't have time to vote and a no vote should mean voting for status quo of no fork.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:46:06

Eh I'm more on saleems side. The cto called out trezor for it's exploit even though the hacker had to have physical access and the exploit was fixed in 8 days. Ledgers exploit also needed physical access (but also doable through software) and was fixed in months. Both were okay as long as you bought from official source but Ledger was still vulnerable to computer infected malware. Both are low chances of occurance but I'm swayed towards trezor since the private keys in the secret enclave is **closed** source. That's a big deal. Saleem mentioned their bug fix has potential for new attack vectors. 
Bitcoin is totally transparent. Would you trust your hot wallet to be closed source?
@_date: 2018-03-14 05:26:20
Seems doable. Like if heads and tails are different on the trezor screen and you press the two buttons to correspond. Also passwords should be done on the trezor like the advanced recovery. It would be perfect in that regard.

It's not though? The white paper states the chain with the longest, most worked on , VALID chain is Bitcoin.
Bcash broke consensus rules and thus had to hardfork, making it not valid
Bcash has less proof of work accumulated than Bitcoin, meaning it's not Bitcoin. Think about it. Someone can fork Bitcoin cash right now and claim it's Bitcoin cash according to you. How do you know which is the real Bitcoin cash chain? The one with the most accumulated work.

@_date: 2018-03-27 01:59:38
Yeah. Basically you don't have your own funds and the seed they gave you is not sweepable. I can prove since the network fee they charge doesn't add up to the fee I got from the Bitcoin transaction. They don't let you take screenshots within the app but I did a video screenshot. They definitely profit off both the exchange rate ($200 more per bitcoin, but fair compared to other exchanges) and they most definitely profit off the network fee, even though they say they don't. A difference of some change went to a return address that was not mine. However after all is said and done it was cheaper than coinbase/gdax for me. Just pissed they said you can sweep coins to an external wallet but you can't.

I meant people save money in a deflationary currency, where their purchasing power increases, so they can buy things outright than to use a loan and buy things sooner. A loan is riskier than saving.
And Bitcoin is both the payment network and currency so it competes with banks and PayPal/venmo. The existing solutions pay you with Monopoly money that has been decreed to have value even when no one knows how much is printed. We must trust they only print to ensure 2% inflation. Hard assets like gold and bitcoin are better to save in because they are finite compared to infinite Chuck e cheese money.

You guys down it him but what he's saying is actually what is promising about Bitcoin. No central authority saying what you can do with your money.  Peer to peer for the trade of goods. And I'd argue that drugs is the one thing you have to use crypto for, at least online.  Other things it's better to buy with fiat since you should use your shit currency first before you use your good one. 
Bitcoin isn't supposed to be used for an investment to get more dollars. I mean you can since it's a decentralized protocol, you're free to. But it's missing the point. Why sell gold for paper receipts?

Oh I didn't downvoted you. It's just magic internet points, not as valuable as magic internet money...
The internet is built on layers and so will Bitcoin. As long as the base layer is decentralized and trustless then we are moving in the right direction.
I also do like monero as the only alt coin worth looking into. However, they seem to have an easy time with non contentious hardforking, not necessarily bad but not good either. Also they seem to have an attack vector with contentious hardforks. MoneroV could undermine privacy if your transactions shared ring signatures with users who redeem their MoneroV tokens. It will impact users even if they don't redeem their MoneroV tokens themselves. So say a government transacts on the monero chain before to try and be part of as many ring signatures as possible, then they redeem their MoneroV tokens and would be able to undermine privacy of unrelated parties.

That's how you know r/btc is a sham. When I was a noob and didn't know the difference between r/Bitcoin and r/btc. R/btc gets most of what they hivemind spew wrong. Like how they mentioned that hashrate affects price and segwit 2x was going to win. Or that they have this weird love for Jihan, Roger ver, and fake Satoshi Craig write that only money can buy.

@_date: 2018-03-27 02:25:45
Yeah no don't get me wrong it was cheap and I will be using them again. But they promise that you own the funds and told me I could sweep the private keys into my own wallet but that just wasted my time. They told me instructions to follow and told me I had to scan up to 10 addresses and I probably scanned 50 from different path settings etc. It was shitty and I rather them just tell me I couldn't have done that than to lie about them actually being custodial over the funds. 
We don't actually own the wallet since the change where they profit from network fees goes to an address they own because I certainly did not get those bits back into my Abra wallet.
Again it was shitty of them lying and they should be more transparent. They got a good service and should make money and would do better with the transparency. However will still use since it is shinier than other turds.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:27:09
My full node can reject full mining node blocks if they don't agree on the consensus rules. Do you like work for bitmain? Why do you insist that full mining nodes matter more than economic ones?
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:32:23
Yeah no miners work for free. They follow the chain people are using. Not one where they are by themselves. Majority hashpower just means they can order the transactions, add blocks, and receive the block rewards the majority of the time. They don't get to force the rules on users. People pick the rules to which they want by running their chosen node software. If a miner wants to force rules that no one wants then he forks himself off.
 Chain splits happen all the time by the way. On one side of the world nodes think they have the chain Bitcoin but is different than the other side due to network latency. how can a new node that wants to sync tell which is the real chain? Well they follow the longest, most worked on (hashpower), valid (as per their node software rules) chain to be Bitcoin. All nodes then agree on that exact identical blockchain to be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-07 04:34:33
Do the math for bcash blocks. It's like gigabyte blocks every ten minutes. How long will it take to validate and send those blocks to other peers? Right now ethereum can't even send 800 kb per ten minutes without problem. And they know not to raise their gas/ block size.

@_date: 2018-07-06 00:57:08
Nano is centralized. Free and instant mean I can send 1 nano back and forth infinite times and have someone else log it for all time. The way they fix that is to have snapshots instead of what Bitcoin does by verifying yourself from the Genesis block to the current one. Snapshots isn't as trust less as what Bitcoin does since you're basically asking a friend. And if you don't verify for yourself that's just like the old system where only certain nodes (ledgers) are verified by a few trusted authorities. Look up why POS or dpos can't truly claim decentralization, the entire value proposition of blockchain.

Is it because you are never sure which chain is the correct one?
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:05:38
It's a little less than 21 million due to the block reward getting less and less to zero and also miners would ask for less in the coinbase transactions. So the block reward is the maximum they can get but they can for example choose to be rewarded  1 Bitcoin and not currently 12.5 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-06 01:29:29
But then you incur an opportunity costsfor holding both fiat and Bitcoin. If you know fiat will decrease you should convert to Bitcoin and sell back in a year or so when needed. Ig enough people catch on then it will form a positive feedback loop.

By that time no one will even want dollars. Why sell for worthless currency? It's like trying to have more units of bcash.
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:48:40
That's like adoption of usd already. The reason why Bitcoin isn't as mainstream is because it's truly decentralized where there's no central authority to force you to adopt it, people adopt it on their own will because it's a superior currency. And crypto doesn't make sense if there's no decentralization, it would just be a slow private fiat. Better to have the old system at that point.
@_date: 2018-07-14 18:10:03

@_date: 2018-07-16 14:08:01
(75 USD) ÷ (6200 usd/bitcoin) =  0.0120968 bitcoin. 1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 Satoshi or 1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 Bitcoin. (Different exchange rate of 6589 USD/Bitcoin) So for 1 cent ($0.01) you can buy 0.0000015 Bitcoin or 150 Satoshi.

Honestly I would've done the same as Charlie. But also ver. I don't know if being rich would make me scam people into thinking bcash is Bitcoin as I would make more long term by not trashing my reputation. But I also understand why ver shills bcash but still owns bitcoin. He had a huge free airdrop that he needs to unload on suckers.

For anyone who doesn't want to click on Twitter to click on a link:
The first quarter of 2018 had been pretty grievous with the bitcoin prices falling below $6,000 at one point and the overall crypto market size dropping by about 57 percent. However, today the market did experience some green with bitcoin currently being at $7,083, ethereum at $390 and Litecoin at $119, let’s take a look at upcoming crypto events 2018 that triggers crypto market again.
As we reported earlier, many analysts are considering it the death of bitcoin while people like Bill Barhydt, theCEO of Abra believes a bullish trend is coming soon that will be the result of institutional investors’ entry into the crypto market.
A bullish trend is certainly in order but there are certain events that would trigger the positive sentiments in thecrypto market leading to the upward trend.
Consensus: A highly anticipated Coindesk crypto event
To be held on May 14, this 3-day Consensus 2018 cryptoevents involves big names from cryptocurrency industry and also includes regulatory authorities that will discuss blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Last year this event triggered the bullish trend of June.
It has been believed that this highly anticipated event will do a repeat of history and bring the wave of roaring green in the market.
SEC’s approval on crypto-based ETFs
One such event that requires our special attention is if SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) allows the trading of crypto ETFs. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is basically an investment fund which is traded on stock exchanges just like stocks which are very attractive as investments because of their stock like features, low costs, and tax efficiency. Most ETFs track an index and operates with an arbitrage mechanism.
In January, SEC asked several crypto-based ETFsto withdraw their proposals citing how the funds holding massive crypto amounts can’t satisfy the 1940 Act which is basically investment advisors act that requires the security investment advisors to be registered with the SEC.
At the end of last month, Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) that launched bitcoin futures made an appeal to the SEC to allow ETFs for cryptocurrencies.
Crypto ETF covers various difficult financial products which means it allows the investors to purchase groups of cryptocurrencies instead of having them make individual investments in different currencies. This means investors would be less exposed to the wide volatility in the crypto market.
Through ETFs, an investor can pursue additional currencies while holding the stake in the popular bitcoin at the same time. If SEC does approve crypto ETFs albeit of course by putting substantive measures on them, it will help building investors trust in them as well.
Putting a hard cap on Ethereum (ETH)
Recently, ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed in a post on Github to cap the ethereum supply at 120 million eth. No doubt, by limiting the supply of eth cryptocurrency, a potential price rise is in its future.
SEC has been always been pretty rough when it comes to ICO. With the increase in the scams and frauds in the ICO projects, this surely doesn’t come as a surprise. Regulatory authorities want to curb down the illicit and deceitful use of this crowdfunding method by bringing them under their regulatory provisions. This would only help the crypto community as it not only aids in eliminating the bad factors but will also bring the institutional investors into the market once they know where exactly the market stands with the authorities.
SEC has been issuing notices to the individual ICO projects, but ethereum being the most used and popular backing technology for ICOs, it won’t be long when it would be directly approached by the authorities.
By capping the ethereum supply, the entry into the ICO market can be made tough and restrictive that would also lead to increase in the prices of GAS that would further eliminate the opportunists looking for making quick bucks through ICO market.
All these crypto events currently hold a major significance in the cryptocurrency sector that will lead to an upward trend.

Wait the power consumption of mining will always be in equilibrium with difficulty adjustments to maintain an average of ten minute blocks.
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:02:55
What I don't understand is what price do I give? My local exchange? Or can I highball it with the local Bitcoin one in like zimbabwe. Or does it require an agregate of every single exchange rate? Is there a limit how much I can increase/decrease the price to my favor? 
And say you bought bitcoins to use fully to purchase a product. Because doesn't buying bitcoin for coinbase and cashing out to your wallet always leave you negative? And they can't decipher within reason if I sent all funds to a merchant, my own account, or like gifted it to a friend/religious organization since those events are tax free. Gifts are under $15000 to be taxed free.
I feel like at this point it's like an honor system to pay taxes for crypto. Like the leave a penny take a penny shit.
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:16:54

Because during the contentious hardfork large holders got 1:1 of bcash. They want Bitcoin to look bad so they can sell off the shitcoin for Bitcoin.

Regulation won't happen if the gov is smart. They would rather have a cut of the action than none at all. Canadian banks ban buying crypto with debit and some won't let you bank transfer? People pull out cash resort to localbitcoins and they don't get a piece of the action. [

Send crypto and I'll give you a receipt, a Federal reserve note, for your coins! You can withdraw anytime except when others withdrawal and there's not enough so you'll be limited on withdrawals. And you can't buy things I disagree with, like non lambo/tesla cars, boob implants, or turkey bacon.

What about the on off ramps of bisq, decentralized exchange, or local bitcoins?
How can they tax with the loophole of anything under 15,000 as a gift is untaxable? How will they know you are sending to someone else vs your  own self? Anything for religious reasons is untaxable?
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:47:10
Did they get fair market value? And I didn't think eminent domain could be brought by companies. Just thought it was used for highways/military bases/metro type shit.

Yes it has uses in technology and jewlery but as a currency it doesn't need more than 1. Scarcity 2.fungibility 3. Divisibility 4.durability 5. transferability imo. It doesn't need a use besides being accepted for trade for being stored as value or future trades to be a currency.

So it's not proportional the amount of hashrate you have to the chances of finding a block? But doesnt that just mean bitmain will be the only one who can mine eventually? With difficulty increasing, bitmain is the only Asic manufacturer. They buy more research and development into new coins/ operations where electricity is wasted by not being able to be stored.

Set up a pin on electrum to stop someone from sending funds when they see your wallet open.
But to recover or use other wallets at the same time you can import to other wallets, maybe because I think Electrum uses a different set of words, you just need the seed words AND the password.
 If you have password enabled, to send coins you need both to access the coins.

Id rather have everyone hoard than everyone spend. If everyone used it to spend and never to hold then why use it in the first place?

No. Usd price is extrinsic to the Bitcoin network. Just have the exchanges price things in bits/satoshi

And value under $15000($1500?) usd as a gift aren't taxable. And religious donations aren't taxable either. Kind of hard to tell what is a gift to a friend vs a merchant or to an account you own.

I mean that's not better than Bitcoin, faster yes but less dencentealized, but at least they are upgrading to the competition. There's still fees to have a bank account in America.

If anything the emp would take down the internet? And this emp would have to hit everywhere on earth at the same time to be sure. But one node in a Faraday cage is enough to save everyone's balances.
Your private keys are fine if you wrote it down or stamped it on metal. And with no internet I sure we can transact Bitcoin using radio waves. Internet is just the most convenient way to propogate information

I understand but there's an opportunity cost by not taking money that's on the table. mining is very cutthroat in that profits needs to be reinvested into more miners to keep up with the difficulty.

Fuck Weiss. Didn't Bitcoin get a C rating?

It can't manipulate the blockchain since it must match everyone's ledger

Miners are the one who benefit from soamming the chain. They get their fees back and introduce a higher fee level for everyone else.

Gold can be used as a currency/store of value. But it's a bad one compared to Bitcoin. The hard part of digital money is how to program it to be scarce/finite like gold. 
Bitcoin is better than gold to be used as a currency and the only thing it needs to be trusted is time. People need to feel safe that the network wont be hacked and it works as intended.

Not really? Those same businesses can adopt Bitcoin right now? Like it's fucking peer to peer and permissionless. Generate a new wallet address from a watch only wallet like sentinel to let someone scan and pay with Bitcoin. They are using mobile apps anyways. And square won't get a cut.

Maybe to ver scams aren't illegal like inside trading. It's the people's fault for getting tricked into thinking that bitcoin cash is Bitcoin?

No your Bitcoin value is stored with everyone who runs a full node, the blockchain. So like we have this line for you with this account owns this much. But only a private key can be used to allow the funds to move into another account.
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:56:06
I feel like Bitcoin will go to some number most people wouldn't believe to go to. Like when Bitcoin was $15 and went to $1000. Again not psychic nor analyst. Just feelz

No it doesn't have merit. Core nodes could have wrote the 2x blocksize increase but people wouldnt have upgraded their nodes like how people didn't upgrade their nodes to the bcash 2x blocksize increase hardfork. It was tried by bcash and didn't take off.

Well it does have revalence. Bitcoin is as good as a store of value as gold and can be used to transact with. You don't have to test it for being counterfeit. Just needs the same test of trust people had with gold.
