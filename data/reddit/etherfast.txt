Under 10% of bankroll, as USD.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:33:14
According to Zane, USD balances are and will be unaffected. It will probably be a while until they are withdrawable, though.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:16:19
Oh hey guys, small world. :)
I had only about 10% of my bankroll, as USD, but I am just following the situation closely.
What about you?
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:02:50
The incentive itself should be bigger, towards 25%, especially since it rewards the original set of coins being returned to you. It's not something you pay out of pocket right now, in these times of crisis, it's something you will potentially pay if the problem is solved.
Hypothetically speaking, if you get the 71M back, you will afford to pay 18M bounty and you will have plenty left to purchase the BFX coins at face value.

Single point of contact helps a lot in these situations. Also, it's his job.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:31:38
Yeah, I typed this moments before the announcement.
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:44:07
You're cute.

No, it was not. Overstock implemented the Coinbase API incorrectly.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:47:12
Depends on how long ago the event actually happened. 
2 months for a subpoena is still early to influence the markets with potential effects, but go ahead and tell people how Bitfinex was hacked a year and a half ago and you can see that it doesn't matter as much.
If we were to find about the Bitfinex hack a year after, it wouldn't have the same effect on the market.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:08:26


Knowledgeable people generally don't want to bother typing out an answer for what it actually is a very dumb question. No, Coinbase isn't closing off your account because you're using it for the very purpose it was built for, OBVIOUSLY. Your assumption is really far fetched and illogical.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:55:53
How can the blockchain be irrelevant?
This is essentially a second-layer solution, settlements will still be made over the blockchain when they decide to. 
Also, it's not trustless, but I guess that's not a problem between big and registered exchanges.
If you want to draw a comparison, it's basically the same thing Coinbase and GDAX are doing. They could just do everything over the blockchain, but since they're both in their own back yard, it would be pointless to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:51
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:35:00
You're doing a poor job of promoting this scam website. I'm reporting it.
Instapage, really?
**Edit:** poor grammar and inconsistencies within the text, little to no branding or UX, built in a few minutes with Instapage, domain details/owner hidden. 
No way this is legit, even as a placeholder for a future implementation. I would advise against putting your e-mail there.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:48:55
Hny :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:05:25
The problem is that any one of the "work in progress" solutions we have right now needs long adoption times and depends on others.
Heavy congestion is happening right NOW and there is no immediate solution to that. Sure, I can outbid everyone and get my payment confirmed fast, but this constant state of congestion combined with high fees hurts Bitcoin and I don't know how much it can keep up like this.

We don't know for sure that the Twitter account is handled by HBO. 
For all we know, it could be a show fan that's connected to cryptocurrency and "gets" the BTC/BCH debate.

So classy. Smh.

PM me your wallet address, I'll send you the difference you need.

You'd think you'd be fine, but take a look at the most recent BitFinex incident where they applied a 36% haircut to every customer, including USD balances and Ethereum balances.
It's not safe.
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:11:41
I've seen a most of them come with a 1-3-6 months warranty, so I'm guessing, not much.
They can be overclocked for better performance, and having your GPU to 100% and beyond, 100% of the time is really stresful.
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:09:35
Thanks :)

The split is made in accordance to the snapshot of the blockchain at the block before the fork. 
I assume you need the seed in order to proceed with the firmware update, right? Because otherwise you don't need the seed to successfully split the coins and transfer them out.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:23:06
Even if the information in your reply was correct, you were rude.
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:23:29
Congratulations. 
Here's a typo on the website :)

You jinxed it.

OPSkins/BTC/Steam heavy user here. 
Things evolved nicely in the past year. As Bitcoin adoption rate among CS GO traders grew significantly, it was only natural they'd implement and use it as a payment system. 
It makes money/value so much easier to move inside the ecosystem, it's chargeback-free and the fees are significantly low. 
They put a lot of effort into advertising and getting the user base, though. Without users, the transaction volume wouldn't have been as big.
Big props to all parties involved :)
@_date: 2016-02-23 08:28:39
This. So many misconceptions and rumors, even though it's clearly stated in the TOS and leaves no place for interpretation.
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:43:46
You didn't pay 8 cents because of Segwit and the mempool is not almost empty because of Segwit. 
We are getting there, but for now adoption is still pretty low.
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:32:53
I'm not a supporter of big blocks. I just wanted to point out that the title of his post is misleading. The fact that he pad a lower fee now is not due to Segwit being activated two weeks ago, therefore "Yay, segwit is working!!!" is misleading.
@_date: 2016-09-06 20:49:57
This is gold ;)
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:24:15
The price hardly skyrocketed from the $3500 dip you were expecting to what we're at now.
If you buy right now, you're only losing about 3% of what you made by selling at $3700, since the price is around $3800 (and was aroud $3700 a few hours ago).
This way you're not missing the train if it goes up even more, and if this is a long term investment you shouldn't be trying to predict the price from one day to another anyway. Don't put money you're not willing to lose in this either.
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:27:29
And that is both unfair and irrelevant math. BTC has a significantly higher adoption rate and a lot of support from wallets and exchanges (thus generating said transactions), BCH is a new coin that exchanges are barely accepting and it's slowly gaining traction.
The majority of users aren't technical, they won't know if they need/want Segwit or bigger blocks, or whatever. They are doing what the majority does, which is defaulting to BTC and probably not even bothering with BCH. So you have a legacy coin that slowly migrates to Segwit, as exchanges and wallets migrate to Segwit, and you have a new coin that's trying to take its place, but has a hard time doing so since it's not the legacy BTC, so it has a low adoption rate. It's apples and oranges.
TLDR: You can't say "the number of people using SegWit is greater than the number of people using bigger blocks" and consider it a victory for BTC. 
BCH is on its own agenda and path, wherever it may take them. This sub should be more about BTC and less about "Look, BTC is better than BCH, haha".
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:23:01
BCH and BTC addresses are generated in the same way and have the same format.
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:34:58
Two weeks ago if you didn't pay $5-8 and sometimes a lot more, your transactions would remain unconfirmed, because there were a lot of other transactions in the pool outbidding you.
Segwit is gaining speed, but Segwit transactions are at a small percentage right now compared to legacy transactions, it's too early to say "the fact that I paid a lower fee is because Segwit is truly working".

The funny thing about arbitrage in this decentralized network is that it works regardless of people's agendas. 
Assuming every miner shuts down instantly and there is no one to generate a block, it's just a matter of time until someone else will take that reward, because it's attractive to them, seeing as there is no competition. Sure, the blocks will slow down for a while, but things will be back to normal pretty fast.
Also, everyone dropping in the same time is highly unlikely as well (has listed some cases that will most likely prevent everyone from leaving).

Today Bitcoin was ATH.

Look at it this way. 72M is illegal in hacker's possession, but it's legal in Bitfinex's possession.
Bitfinex are OK with paying a huge amount of money to get back 72M they wouldn't have access to otherwise.
