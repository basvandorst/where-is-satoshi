in any accounting system, bitcoind or database based, it is impossible not to notice you are taking other peoples funds to pay other people multiple times (over and above their balance)! losing money via malleability happens to be exactly how ponzi schemes 'lose' money

this guy operates a fraud, mtgox stole our funds (just took our most recent wire deposit then unverified our account, pretended they didn't receive AML docs that were signed for, then disabled our account), how can he even be a bitcoin foundation board member! no faith in the bitcoin foundation anymore

can you help us? we have a verified 10k deposit, verified delivery of our AML documents (signed by mtgox as delivered and tracking number), but mtgox just sends canned responses about not being verified, will not release our funds, and just suspended our account...

verified since February. our June deposit of 10k went missing. 7 months of canned support responses, resent our AML (with signature verified delivery) twice, then in late December our account and support account was suspended. basically10k stolen.

oh yeh thanks, should call them. 
my reversal failed, they said Mizuho bank refused the reversal, no other information.

our bank says they can't do anything, mizuho just refused any request. i will have to ask about police report or legal action (although legal action sounds expensive and difficult being an international issue

incoming funds are not shown anywhere, not in history or anywhere else. my account changed from verified (have been using it for months) to unverified (position 265). Support request says no refunds.

this is not transparent, you have not provided any proof anything you say is true. mtgox just decided to unverify my account, lock my funds, refused any refund, and ignoring support requests. i jut got scammed by them
@_date: 2013-07-22 01:41:22
now its been almost 2 months since the funds went missing at mtgox, and 3 weeks after i reversed the wire....chase...ha, these issues are the reason i wanted to use btc....
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:48:11
the deposit does not show up at all, even though it is acknowledged by mtgox in the support case, and by my bank. mtgox are frauds
@_date: 2013-07-16 09:42:13
oh shit...yeh, its already been over 2 weeks and my bank is just saying there is no response from mtgox
@_date: 2013-07-29 09:52:19
this is rediculous, 4 weeks now since i tried to reclaim the funds, not a word from mtgox. seems like i can't do anything...what happened for you?
@_date: 2013-09-19 12:46:48
how would i go about legal action? mt gox is not responding and have no way to access or get back my funds...
@_date: 2013-09-10 15:20:01
if someone accesses your bank, it will be transferred to irreversible destinations. the irony is that mtgox bank itself refuses wire reversals, so the procedure you described to get back money is just fiction.
@_date: 2013-07-11 08:41:18
yeh, my funds have been missing for a month, and trying to get it back with a wire reversal for the last 8 days...mtgox not responding to support
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:59:33
lots of demand in [hong kong]( not enough coins!
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:43:11
[verified in Feb]( 
[funds locked with no refund suddenly in June]( 
They took the money, which means it is verified, but wont release or refund because it is unverified. Still trying to get my bank to reverse the wire...
