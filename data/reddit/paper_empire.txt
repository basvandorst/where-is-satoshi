There is no other coin besides Bitcoin for an organization this large.  Bitcoin is their bread and butter and other coins are just crumbs.

Next time you are actually buying something remember that you are likely overpaying.... After that eats at you for a while you will realize why using btc is a good idea.  Btc cuts out the expensive financial intermediaries without much additional effort. 
Yes you could hold btc.. But you need that product now and btc offers the least expensive method to acquire that product.

if you want to buy something cheap and want the same deal and treatment as a broke person with a delinquent credit score then prepaid works great.

After factoring in all risks, such as delayed shipment, your best bang for your buck is buying bitcoin and not mining it.

It gets worse.  Just wait until you receive the "no sufficient funds" penalty fee for going into the negatives.

The bank likely has a much more efficient and predicable market than BTC's at the moment.  Good luck either way.

I'm in Alberta and I've been using BTC-E for quite a while.  I've completed single transfers in excess of $50,000 without any problems.
@_date: 2014-07-03 01:35:25
Banks seems great until they decide to hold your transferred money for longer than they said and then you have to find time to go to bank and talk to a bunch of useless low level employees who cannot fix your problem in a timely manner.
Or they decide to reverse the transaction for whatever bullshit reason and now you've no longer paid in time and you've hurt your credit and incurred penalties. 
Or it's 4:30pm and the bank is about to close and they wont transfer your money today.

Not worth it.  By the time you buy and receive your miner you will be very unlikely to break even.  Delays and false promises are rampant among almost all companies selling miners.  Furthermore, cloud mining is even worse from an investment point of view.  Save your money and stay away from mining.

You're just being rude and his post is relevant as there currently is a massive shift in sentiment from LTC to BTC.  You do not speak for all of us.

Look at a lifelong graph of all your options and it will become obvious bitcoin is the only option.  The hype is fading for altcoins and they have little intrinsic value because of overwhelmingly small networks.

if the priced negatively changed during your ride it would at most be the equivalent of hitting 1 additional red light and that's if it was a long ride.  On the other hand, the price could positively change on your ride.  Bitcoin is on a long term upward trend, considering it was worth basically nothing in 2009.  And if the price movement is still a real issue for a penny watching person Uber could state the bitcoin exchange rate is locked in at the moment of initiating the service.  The amount of risk picked up by Uber doing this is nothing in comparison to automatically losing money every time someone uses a credit card.

So let me get tgis right.  You're asking a caring and competent individual to divert their finite time and resources to work on a very complicated problem by themselves that will better the community, but likely provide little to no reward for themselves.  Realistically, this individual will need to have top tier bitcoin and programming knowledge, which I might add is in very high demand right now, and be willing to forgo working at a number of bitcoin or tech startups (and the reward associated with those startups).  Anyone that's qualified for this job could likely start working tomorrow at any number of tech firms.
I'm calling it now.  Anyone that is volunteering as a replacent is probably garbage as they have a flawed understanding of how to utilize their talents; thus illustrating a lack of talent.

Lots of innovation is happening on top of the bitcoin network.  That's where all the outside investment is going.  Very little outside investment is going towards working on top of other altcoins.  At this stage, it's far more beneficial to have innovation on top of the network than in the network if we want to reach mass adoption.

You sound like an outlier who's been financially destroyed.  Many self employed people like myself are not that hard done by and don't have to start over again from scratch.  Self employed people should not be pigeon-holed into using prepaid cards just because we're self employed.  Yes, using a prepaid card is an option.... but it's a crappy option.

Once you incorporate you are looking at another decent sized cost for filing and preparing your taxes.  Most banks will not lend you anything unless you have 2 years of payment history under your corporation or unless the loan is collateralized against hard assets.

Yes I can get a debit card.  But I can't go pay for anything larger than $1500/day with it because of the bank's rules.  That means it's essentially only useful for getting groceries and gas.  In a given month I often have days where I pay for services and goods that cost in excess of $20,000.  Thus, a debit card is not an option.

Someone is always selling. Go look at  to see the order books on various major exchanges.

You have obviously made up your mind so please keep an active thread where you tell everyone your progress.  This way others may learn from your mistakes.  Also, this will be the worst investment of your life.  The basic administrative/hosting fee associated with your cloud mining contract will quickly outpace your mining reward.  If there is any actual bitcoin price run or shift in technology your contracts will become obsolete in a hurry.  Lastly, remember that no one is the business of selling you $1 for less than a $1; hence, you're making a mistake.   Good luck and remember to document this tragedy.

Because you can quickly convert your fiat to btc and then purchase a product at a discount.

I read an article a while back saying about a trillion USD per year was lost due to corruption.  A lot of the current corruption is possible because of our centralized system which allows a select few to sit at the top and play god; thus, the bitcoin system is likely better for the average Joe, even with his amateur security precautions, in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-07-20 07:27:18
Hoarders only hoard bitcoin because of its continually increasing value, derived from widespread adoption and ever increasing "use" value.
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:32:29
Good luck preparing your taxes if you do that.  You would likely mess up your book keeping and your friends book keeping; likely costing you far more in the end.  Coinbase is really inexpensive as is and is multiples cheaper than standard payment processors.  Not worth it IMO.

You're assuming that when you buy a miner it arrives on time and works.  After factoring in that uncertainty mining is unprofitable.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:53:56
A 51% attack would be beyond detrimental at this stage.  Every news agency in the world would be viciously slamming bitcoin, likely stopping mass adoption in its tracks.  A 51% is a very real problem which does need to be mitigated and small players react only after the fact, as history has shown.

If they are selling to the US you are buying shares in a firm that is likely to be hit with fines... Which means you will be indirectly paying for those fines when your shares drop in value.

I have a substantive net worth but have been self employed for almost all my working life and I find it very hard to get a credit card.  I can have over 6 figures sitting in cash in my account and yet cant get a 5K credit card.  Just because they send you a pre-approved doesn't mean they will actually give you the card.  Meanwhile my wife makes 5x less and can get one just because she isn't self employed.

Security is only 5% of what is needed for success.  Anyone can built a super secure coin or platform (just look at quarkcoin).  The problem is no one cares and no one is going to use it and build around it.  Network effect is everything and every alt coin is struggling to remain relevant.  Just look at the number of users in each forum for each coin.   Bitcoin consistently has 600-1200 and is growing, whereas most alt coins initially spike at around 50 before falling to 5 or less.  Dogecoin is the only coin besides bitcoin to generate a following but even in the last month its following has decreased by 50%.  Basically it sums up as don't waste your money investing in alt coins... Especially new alt coins.. 99.9% of them will fail in the long run as liquidity and interest dries up.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:44:05
Save your money.  No outside capital is going to invest the time and resources to build a platform which competes with bitcoin.  If it is a good idea someone will implement it using bitcoin.  There is a reason why venture capital is lined up to invest in bitcoin projects and not alt coin projects.  Follow the smart money.
Scenario 1: it's a great idea and you still lose your investment
Scenario 2: it's a horrible idea and you lose your investment

Dark is never really going to take off.  No legit real businesses are going to want exposure or want to be associated with a coin that the shady of the shady flock to.  Bitcoin is already having enough trouble overcoming its negative stigma.  Therefor dark has no chance.  It's too big of a change from our current financial system and legit people don't want to be used as cover for someone else's shady actions.

I made a similar mistake and probably lost around 14 BTC from buying alt coins.  It took me that long to realize that a coin's intrinsic value is basically: 75% network effect, 15% community following, 10% specs.  No other alt coin can compare with the network effect of bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2014-08-24 06:42:57

A sample size of 1 is irrelevant.  I regularly moved tens of thousands through wire transfers and they regularly get trapped in limbo and require multiple visits to the bank to unlock.  Good job on running well.
