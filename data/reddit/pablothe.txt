Yeah and shopping online in the 90s was shit, Paypal made it much easier but everyone hates paypal. 
I feel weird about Bitcoin because even if cryptocurrencies DO work, we don't know which one will.

Why is it that in this subreddit if someone agrees with BTC he's an expert or understands it but if someone doesn't they outright don't get it

what about canadian? and how much is that to micro bits? how many satoshis? what about mexican pesos?

This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-09-04 04:24:23
But it's equally as safe as BTC, everything people love about it Dogecoin has as well. The only reason there's a big btc circlejerk is because people invested in btc more and therefore want to see it go higher, doesn't seem to be because they believe in the technology or else they would cheer for all currencies 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:47:46

Not only that, Satoshi owns a big part of bitcoin, what if a government was Satoshi, how would people feel about someone with real interest having a real effect on the currency?
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:28:02
Wouldn't the fact that I'm using those services to go from BTC to USD constitute a capital gain? I don't understand why I have to do this instead of relying on something like Paypal which allows dissatisfied customers to be paid back automatically and cover risks.

Thanks for the post, I've just seen many of my friends having incredible difficulties selling btc or using them as payment systems.
@_date: 2014-04-20 02:59:53
Wait I don't understand how that's relevant to the bank
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:44:32
Who understands BTC though? Makes using money so much more difficult to understand.
@_date: 2014-09-14 04:25:36
Why is there a transaction fee for BTC, isn't the whole point of the protocol that the blockchain is open and I don't have to pay?
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:54:19
we should make a new division called Bitsatoshi which is 1,000,000 of a satoshi so here it would be 100,000,000,000,000 bitsatoshis

On the other hand if I get express kidnapped and someone robs my wallet I lose a couple of hundred dollars but with btc I'd lose everything.
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:42:48
I guess that's true, but it's much harder to spend $1000 goods in BTC at the mall, so there's that too.

I love that when BTC price goes down, the entire subreddit claims the public is stupid. But when the price goes artificially up is because the public is educated. I didn't see this image when the price reached 4 digits.

I like you too

I don't think the average person can understand btc if I don't even understand it fully. I feel the technology is too difficult to use and governments won't lack the lack of regulation and could eventually ban bitcoin. 
In terms of EMP, I just meant to say the technology is more fragile than gold or fiat currencies due to it's inherent vulnerabilities as technology. An EMP powerful enough to wipe tons of hard drives is not that difficult to imagine and yeah it would affect everyone
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:03:01

The post has more upvotes than downvotes, the fact that 61% approved this bs post shows how much circle jerk there is.

What's up with the grammar, are people reading this thing?
So what my business now accepts bitcoins, what do I do next, how do I transform that into actual cash that I can use, or not pay capital gain taxes which are 30%.
It seems like people in this subreddit are delusional because they've invested in btc.

@_date: 2014-08-14 16:42:52
It's hard not to be when your post was pretty condescending itself, and also I don't even know why it matters to you why he said that number. You also have to realize he has a board of directors that he has to be overly optimistic to, and finally you have to realize that even if he made 2m we don't know if it took 80% to make 1m and 20% to make the other one and therefore his confidence is high
@_date: 2014-05-06 23:42:25
Banking has nothing to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a currency the bank is a completely different beast. Why do people even compare both anymore?
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:57:27
WTF no it has nothing to do with that.
Particles don't behave like btc because they act in completely different ways, can be created and destroyed all the time and transferred into energy. BTC is not a zero-sum game.
It costs more energy to transfer more particles, you can transfer a million btc for the same energy as a fraction of one. The analogy just makes no sense and there's no reason it should even matter.

not really, more like "We don't allow it because you seem to be doing transactions outside of our control".
Many people have gotten their accounts frozen when linked to btc.

There's also tons of BTC hoarding instead of buying them, purchasing goods and then buying more. And whenever they want they show how BTC is so much better and safer than money but if someone loses tons of BTC they say "well you shouldn't have invested it all in BTC".

I'm not sure if he has to understand the technology behind it to feel threatened by something that allows people to move large amounts of money fast and without trace.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:05:38
I would never do that, I believe in the technology but I don't know if BTC will be the preferred protocol, there are still some major issues with it I don't agree with.

Using that logic they shouldn't add BTC either, the volume is nothing compared to all real currencies.

I don't get it, you got 0.1 milibitcoins? as in 0.1 x 10^-3 Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:20:49
This is actually a good thing.

How does it work?
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:22:12
OMG GUYS I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING
WE MAKE FUN OF DOGECOIN RIGHT? MAYBE DOGECOIN IS THE REAL REVOLUTION CRYPTOCURRENCY.
Thanks OP :)

The price graph makes no sense either, gold's x axis constantly changes from centuries to individual years while btc is constant, y axis is also different in both to make it seem similar between both.

Test. Don't upvote.

lol then Instagram is one of the most influential sites for photographers
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:10:16
Yes because one of the most corrupt first world countries controlled by a powerful oligarchy would choose bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:53:45
Exactly, their strategies are wrong unless it seems like my situation, then they are experts.

Damn you must be pretty attractive OP I don't think I have talked to that many girls 
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:56:28
Also of course BTC wins, that's why we stopped using gold immediately as the standard and started using BTC. It's obviously so much better in every way!
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:15:39
You can get it with a btc mining operation.

Holy shit you need to get this to mt Gox!!!

How do I buy one bitcoin without having to give any personal information, and doing it fast and easy? Honest Question.
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:58:26
Might be because bitcoin is so small compared to them that you don't yet see global effects playing a role.
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:55:28
This is why BTC will never grow. I get kidnapped and the money is gone for good. No safety or insurance. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:40:26
2018 and only a Bitcoin exchange? I never understand why Mexico is always so behind in tech. At least the founders are pretty well educated people. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:04:02
I mean if you know they next month it will crash then yeah. You'd sell right away. But the problem is you don't know that. So instead you hold on to it and wait till next month to cash out and find out if you do that you'll be losing.
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:59:07
I guess the Twitter said starting to and that was confusing. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:32:59
Why wouldn't I hold when I get paid in ethereum for a job and the next month it crashes so much that it's essentially a risk to cash out? And I mean cash out because I can't pay rent or taxes with eth
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:53:21
Obviously this attack shows why we should ban bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-06 05:22:26
Dude shush you are not contributing to the circle jerk
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:48:06
Exactly. It's similar to the people that say that religions are not the problem, just that people don't practice them well.
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:22:17
I wouldn't risk having my money accessible at home in Mexico.

This is why people fear / hate GMOs

What's the problem with inflation, price variation? Because if that's the only problem BTC seems to have it worse tbh.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:33:33
I would still need a bank to store my BTC though right? I would not keep everything in wallets, I would probably need my own cold storage so then we go back to securing that.
@_date: 2015-02-16 08:24:05
I hope so, I really should learn more about BTC
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:27:03
This just shows how disconnected the public is from BTC
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:41:51
So how are Bitcoin ATM's transported? They don't need guards? I thought some were actually just robbed. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 03:08:48
Hey I own a bitcoin, just learning about it. I've always wanted to know what's in the lounge! Can I be part of the reddit gold experience?!
