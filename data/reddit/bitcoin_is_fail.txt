Proper safes are secured to the ground, which means they can't simply be 'put on their shoulder' and carried out.
Thieves who smash and grab go for TVs, cash lying around, etc. - they're not even going to bother with grounded safes because they don't have the tools to do anything with it.
That's why I say if they're going to break into your safe, they most likely know exactly what they're looking for.
Here's an example of a real safe robbery (guy was storing his precious metals in these, thieves brought tools to bust it open - and not simple tools either):

You might not be, but I am and in my original post I explicitly say 'grounded safe'. So suck on that for a while, and then consider this:
What kind of dumb cunt doesn't use a grounded safe anyway?

Maybe if you're a smug cunt who is dumb enough to plan for thieves like they're Horace &amp; Jasper
If there's an empty safe in your house, or you've filled it with items of negligible value, it tells a thief you've likely got some valuables hidden around the place.
And if he gets ahold of you, you can bet your sorry ass he isn't going to be impressed by your attempted little trick, especially if he's been fooled into taking fake replicas and he has to pay a second visit
Another pretty dumb one is leaving a few gems in the box and hiding the rest.
A little protip: If there's a guy who has come into your house with the equipment to break out or bust open a grounded safe, it's more than likely he came knowing exactly what he was looking for - and that includes the rest of your family jewels
