Got earplugs you are willing to wear 24/7?

The big, big whales could probably bring the price back by several thousands if they wanted to. We are at the mercy of them, I guess.

One whale sells his position, eliminating buy orders all the way down. This causes more people to panic sell, since they want a profit, which brings it further down until it stabilizes.

12k by tomorrow, 14k-15k by Christmas.

I think the mental treshold just gets pushed back everytime. "Oh it hit 5k which I said to myself I would sell at? Well it keeps rising, so lets keep going"

There are always corrections when it rises this quick, but when the price jumps from 8000 to 9000, the correction might only bring it back a few hundred.

So we reached the top and only going down from here?

Just don't panic if it dips. It always go back up.

If Bitcoin doubles in price and hits 15k (which would be huge) you would have made a whopping 10 bucks. Not worth it to me, but if that's what your comfortable with, then go for it.

Last week wasn't it? Dipped to 5,5k. But when it finally dips, you don't buy either, because you are afraid it's dead and gonna crash further..And then it rebounds and you ask for another dip!
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:26:29
What if the dip is from 8k &gt; 7k? 
It's all rise from here, boy. Maybe, who knows.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:58:28
It's more like a gamble. I got in at 4100 last week, and gained +10%. No stock is gonna do that. Could jump back down to 3000 next week, who knows. Right now it's pretty fun, seeing it rise every day.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:22:31
Was looking good for 4900 a minute there, then it dropped instantly below 4800, lol.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:20:56
Nobody knows. I got in at 4100 and thought it was too late. That was 2 weeks ago and i have seen a 30% return. Maybe 6k will seem cheap 2 weeks from now, or it will crash below 5k. It's a gamble, only bet what you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:23:28
At this rate, we'll hit 5k in one hour.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:39:59
It's crashing man, sell!!
(not really, just hodl)

I'm right there with you, but I just got in the Bitcoin game a few weeks ago, so I hope it will pass.
"Oh god it fell 20 dollars? I'm gonna lose all my money!! Oh it's back up.."
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:10:05
It's getting pumped a lot right now, will probably drop 100-200 soon, but who knows really. There was a 500 dollar drop yesterday, might come another.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:11:56
His savings?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:20:28
Take a better picture then.
