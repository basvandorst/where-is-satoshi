it saddens me that the lbry team would disavow a supporter because of an obvious language barrier.
while others may not draw the same conclusions, i'll be steering clear.

from [his screenshot]( it looks more like you tried to compensate him half of the lost coins due to your own mistake. 
An installer that overwrites wallet files sounds like a recipe for disaster, whether or not users are technically proficient enough to make backups.
Also this lost cause was your supporter since at least Jan from his screenshots, when few would have been interested in LBRY (compared to now at least). 
You'd *have* to be a lost cause to support LBRY, right?

Crystal ball much? You're flailing.

Right. I point out that your extrasensory insight into OP's mind/rationale at the moment he decided to spend *$50,000* on your coin is questionable at best, and your response is that I'm either a troll or blind. *That* is why i'll be steering clear.
I agree that there's no point in continuing this discussion when both parties have already made up their minds. Good luck with LBRY.

OP has added new clues but not for questions 1, 3 and 5. This suggests that these questions do not require clues as they have (possibly) already been answered. Going through this thread, here are those answers:
* 1. george. blade. woman. stop. catelyn.  
* 3. 1.61803 or 3.14159  
* 5. flatirons. trey parker matt stone. robert redford.

I don't have the time so here are my thoughts from 15m of trying to figure this out. hope it helps someone!
1. Game of Thrones, first word on page 98  
don't have the book but the word could vary with each edition. i'll go with george as pointed out.
2. renaissance birth  
florence. italy. or a year?
3. Saintly Math constant (max length = 7)  
this is either pi or the golden ratio (golden = saintly?). 
was kind enough to point out the max length of 7 but did not find it necessary to specify that decimals are not allowed. so 1.61803 or 3.14159
4. Cookbook author  
Cookbook and not Cook book. william, powell or william powell.
5. Boulder, Colorado icons  
icons suggest more than 1. [wiki]( says trey parker and matt stone are from boulder colorado (edit: university of colorado boulder).
Good luck!
