Libertarians have been saying that every 2 years since forever

I'm not saying that it's a good investment, I'm saying that dollars are not toilet paper or even anything close

This isn't about censorship to me so much as forcing people to download certain materials to make use of the platform- if you have to download the ledger to mine then you are forced to download child porn. It doesn't exactly seem nonsensical to have a functionality where you refuse to download certain transactions &amp; just surrender the chance to mine blocks in which those transactions are referenced, or whatever. Maybe there is a reason you can't do that, Idk.

This is kinda how I feel about bitcoin, except I will always see it as useful means of payment rather than an investment. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:13:02
Lmao I came to the sub to see what people who love bitcoin were saying about it and there isn't even an article about it on your front page.

I saw there was something concerning about bitcoin in the national news and thought I'd come see what the people with the knowledge had to say about it, yeah. I'm not an investor I have no great need to read about bitcoin outside of it being interesting technology 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:47:32
I know the difference, sorry if what I said wasn't clear. I don't understand how it changes my point that you currently have to download child porn to mine.

Surely somebody must have seen this coming? I didn't even know BTC had a 'ref' field, I assumed it didn't to prevent stuff like this. But then I guess, you could still just fire off a bunch of 1 satoshi transactions and encode stuff in the destination addresses, so maybe it was inevitable

why bother when they can control the price by issuing unbacked tether?

opportunity cost of the resources you've kept invested though

Is there a single website or service accepting bitcoin not pegged to a fiat currency? Even one? (Donations don't count)
A bitcoin is worth what someone is willing to pay in fiat for one.

If you're the only currency exchange not asking questions, you're going to end up with the filthy money, no question.

Can I pay my taxes in BTC? My rent? Buy stuff from the local market? 
People want BTC. People need fiat.

I just see this as you accepting you're wrong really. One day a bitcoin might be worth one bitcoin; if I got paid in them, paid my rent in them, etc. But as it is right now, it seems you're agreeing with me.


This would be true if there was only one fiat currency, but since we can see how bitcoin trades with a range of fiat currencies, it becomes pretty obvious that it's bitcoin that isn't stable, when the fiat currencies are mostly stable compared to each other. You obviously aren't a fan of fiat, but say we bring gold into the equation, since you probably could exchange that for goods; a bitcoin is not stable relative to the price of gold. Because it's wildly unstable. (The instability making it increasingly less attractive for businesses and increasingly more attractive for speculators is what I think will be the undoing of bitcoin, but I don't really have a problem with fiat in the first place, so I guess I'm not the target market)
