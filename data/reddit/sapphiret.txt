Also some wallets let you set a daily withdrawal limit which if reached requires entering a second password

I'm in a similar situation to you. No formal tech experience. Tech savvy but im no programmer. Work in restaurants and have a degree in political economy. And I really want to break into the world of bitcoin.

Try asking or doing some research at they could probably give you better feedback. People say investing in alts is a gamble, and I agree to an extent, but i think if you invest mainly in bitcoin with a small percentage in strong innovative alts its not much riskier than investing solely in bitcoin (which is also consider gambling by many). I think you need to look for alts that have a purpose and incorporate features that bitcoin does not (ie namecoin=DNS; vericoin=veriSMS, veribit, verisend; darkcoin=privacy/anonymity; gridcoin=scientific discovery). Altcoins are a long shot, I think a few strong ones can coexist with btc. I think you should choose alts that you believe in not just ones you think will make money. In a way that makes it a less risky investment because if it doesn't pan out at least you supported something you felt strongly about. Thats why most of us got into bitcoin, because we believed in it (but let's not fool ourselves we all have $$ in our eyes too).
Personally I like:
Darkcoin DRK
Vericoin VRC
Gridcoin GRID
Namecoin NMC
Litecoin LTC
a few other popular ones that I havent researched thoroughly are:

Yeah its much easier overall and especially convenient for small donations. I have used BTC more for donations than purchases so far.

I bought most of my BTC between 350-630 and I think I'm down $200 or so. Also I invested 0.5 BTC in alt coins (VRC and DRK). I road the prices up and then back down into the floor. So I think I'm down about 75% on those investments but I believe there is a future for both of those coins so I'm still holding.

I agree with op to an extent. You can say use it because you believe in it, it protects your I'd, etc--and I'll agree with you--but businesses that accept bitcoin would do well to offer a small discount or incentive as it benefits them also.

Yes. If you are confident in the long term growth of btc now is a decent time to invest. The price may continue to drop short term, maybe it will rise, but medium to long term it should appreciate. Take my advice with as many grains of salt as you wish.

I think PayPal, newegg, overstock, tiger direct, etc will push up the price in the medium to longterm. But in the short term these companies cashing in btc for fiat will hold the price down.
