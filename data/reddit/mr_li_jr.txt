I live in China (not a Chinese national, though) and the answers to this are surprisingly positive.
1. Mixed statements, but it's considered property, not currency. Speculation is considered risky and is advised against. 
2. No, not really. They make running exchanges difficult, but owning and transacting is fine.
3. No, I don't believe so.
4. I don't think they currently force chat apps or email providers to report activities, but I'm sure they can compel them to, if they wanted. But you do not have to use those apps to transact.

I guess Tether is more flexible in the sense that you can buy it whenever and then use it to DCA or you can buy other coins or if you buy enough, manipulate the market.
Like right now, I'm in an OTC wechat trading group and there's a lot more Tether available than BTC. not many people are offering BTC, I guess they're holding, anticipating a bull run. Meanwhile, there's USDT on offer at a stable price and in quantities over $10000.

I'm not anti tax and I agree the average person doesn't have enough of an understanding of how their money is used, but it would be cool if technology could be used to give us SOME degree of control.
Like if I owe $5000, I owe $5000, no getting out of it. Maybe 50% of it is general use, but I could check some boxes or move a slider and choose where the other 50% would go, or not go.
Obviously there are problems with this, like if I exclude defense from my optional section, the government may choose to use the mandatory 50% for defense. But in a way, if there was some way tax payers could have a say in how a country was run, perhaps elections wouldn't be such ridiculous popularity contests and gerrymandering wouldn't be able to disenfranchise a majority of the country.

My understanding of it, which is admittedly based on Reddit, is that the trustee sold back in Feb or something, for fiat, then came under a lot of fire for doing so. He insisted it didn't affect the price or the market, but he agreed to stop until September. I think in the interim they found a way where the claimants could receive BTC rather than cash.

Since you're new here, you may have joined r/btc and r/bitcoin thinking they were 2 subreddits for the same thing.
Be aware that r/btc is a BCH subreddit. r/bitcoin is a Bitcoin subreddit.
I suspect from the way you asked a question and you called Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core", that you've been reading r/btc.
Bitcoin Core is not the name of BTC, it's a name created by BCH fans to try to make it seem like BCH and BTC were somehow equally valid contenders for the title of "Bitcoin".
Bitcoin Core, in reality, refers to two things, one is a type of node/wallet people can run, the other is a recently created troll/memecoin that is even faster and cheaper than BCH.
I hold Bitcoin (BTC) but I don't use either of the above, so I have no contact with Bitcoin Core at all. Don't allow yourself to be misled by BCH fans with an agenda of confusion.

Well, I was kind of see-sawing back and forth between ETH and BTC as they went up and down against each other. I figured it was a fairly safe strategy as I think both coins will be around for a while and are fairly stable, as far as cryptocurrencies go. I wouldn't mind holding one for a while until it recovered against the other. 
I was steadily increasing my stack slice by slice, but then when ETH dropped waaaay down in BTC value I ended up holding a bunch of ETH and it kept dropping and I don't have any BTC left.
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:32:29

@_date: 2018-08-29 08:02:12
Well I was having a laugh, but privacy is just one reason to use it.
Another is that is financial sovereignty. As corny as it sounds, you never know when a bank is going to withhold your funds.  It might seem like something "that would never happen over here" but it happened in New Zealand recently, which is supposed to be a free, modern, "first world" nation. 
These people were not charged with a crime, yet their access to their own money was restricted. 
Volatility is a problem, but I think it will stabilise as it grows. BTC is already less volatile than it used to be and less volatile than other smaller, newer digital assets.

Mycelium on your phone should be enough for small amounts, if you think of it the same way as cash you'd carry in your wallet - it could conceivably be stolen, but it's not terribly likely.

Not only the ability to spend, but for it to be easier/better than fiat money.
For example if Amazon took crypto, that's cool and all, but a lot of people are obviously already happy with using their credit cards.  
What's the advantage of cryptocurrency?  
Lower fees would be a start. Speed doesn't really matter on the user end, credit card payments go through immediately from the user side.
Security should be a factor, but realistically, storing and spending crypto isn't anywhere near as easy, safe or straight forward as it should be.
I think what we need is people running retailers, like the Overstock guy explaining how accepting crypto saves HIM money. If Amazon switched to mainly crypto and gave discounts for using it, that would probably help.
I think we need custodians - "be your own bank" sounds good and all, but we were able to be our own bank all along with cash stuffed in a mattress. A lot of people don't want the hassle or responsibility and a lot of people just aren't capable of it.
I would also like the option to receive my change in crypto. Like when I pay with cash at a corner store and my change is about $0.15, it would be good if I could flash a QR code and it went into my crypto piggy bank. I'm sick of carrying small change around and it's a hassle for shops to maintain a float of garbage coins that no one really wants and get dumped in a jar when they get home.

If you're only expecting small donations, just get a wallet app on your phone. Make sure you share the public address (probably under "receive BTC" or something). Do not share your private key. 
As the other guy said, consider another crypto like Litecoin or BCH although both of them have lost way more value than BTC has. (Or look up other coins that are fast and that you can actually use/sell for fiat etc.) 
If someone wants to give you 25c BTC isn't ideal.

It might be good for BTC, but spare a thought for the victims. It sucks for the millions of people who lose their life's savings.
For them, it's worse than the people who bought BTC in December and are down now, and they didn't even make a poor decision, they were just in the wrong place.
Some of them will turn to Bitcoin and it's great, but most will not even know about it until it's too late and they've already lost everything. If the US dollar/British Pound collapsed tomorrow or the next day, how many normal, hard working, good people in your life would be screwed?

Why would borrowers want to borrow in BTC?
If I go to bank for a home loan and they show me a place where I borrow BTC, I'd say fuck no, because it's deflationary. Borrowing BTC is for mugs. Surely all borrowers would want to borrow fiat?
How and why is a central bank currency going to die out if demand remains?
I feel like there's a tiny chance of Bitcoin becoming the main form of money in the world. I think it will succeed and exist alongside money, I just don't see it taking over.

On the blockchain they aren't almost instant, they queue up* to be included in the next block. If the next block is found in the few seconds and your transaction is next in line, it might seem instant but that usually doesn't happen.  It can take ages if the mempool (queue) is full. 
*It's like people lining up to go to a nightclub - it's possible to jump the queue if you slip the bouncer a little cash, or if you know the bouncer or if the bouncer just likes the cut of your jib. 
Lightning Network is a proposed second layer that would work immediately and be very cheap. You probably wouldn't use it for sending a million dollars worth - you'd want that locked in on the blockchain immediately - but should work fine for smaller purchases. You might use this for walk around money.

Although newcomers will often mistake bitcoin.com for an official website, it's likely that pretty much all other sources of information will contradict that.
People investing any significant amount of money are probably going to read around and get more info before they drop a chunk of money on it, so they won't be convinced that BCH is the real Bitcoin, they'll be confused, and likely end up doing more research or giving up on Bitcoin altogether. 
The strategy he's using is sowing confusion and hoping for newcomers to make a mistake that favours him.  
That's the very best Ver can get from this strategy - A few extra suckers that don't do their homework to buy into his narrative.   The worst he can get is people getting confused and doing more research and likely coming to the conclusion that BCH is the fork.
The unfortunate side effect of his intentional confusion tactic is that the tangled and confusing mess will likely drive some people away from Bitcoin and possibly crypto completely.

Your math is going bad at the second step = 0.01 is 0.01 of a dollar, so the very first step is giving you the dollar value of your purchase, you don't need to divide by 100.
If one Bitcoin is 1c then you need 21 million pennies to buy them all (assuming they're all mined).
If we're working on today's numbers, you need 17 million pennies.

A developed country 


Small business owner


At first I was just trying to buy bitcoin to hold. It was about $2000, then it went up about $300, I thought it was amazing but I was nervous and I sold it, then it dropped and I bought again. I felt clever. 




Kraken 


Bitcoin because it was the original and its still the strongest, price-wise. 
XRP, despite the hate from dedicated crypto fans and anarcho capitalists, as a realist, I don't think the establishment is going to be torn down and destroyed, it's going to adapt. I think Ripple is doing things that will work in the long term.
Ethereum not about making money, it's just full of potential.


I think the Chinese national cryptocurrency will allow the government to monitor the movement of money in the country. That's not 100% bad, as there is a lot of corruption and also a lot of counterfeit notes and general cash-based crime, the national crypto currency could help to mitigate or reduce a lot of these problems. 
One negative aspect is that people will lose a lot of privacy in a cashless society, but you could say that has already happened in China with everyone using wechat pay and alipay. 
I'm curious to see how the digital yuan will be handled with regards to capital flight. 


I don't think trading is for me. I might sell on a bug swing up or buy in a big dip, but it's not something I do all the time.

Consensus - if there's no consensus, there's no Bitcoin.
Whether a block is added to the chain depends on the miners' and nodes' consensus. Which protocols to use depends on the nodes and miners agreeing to use it. Whether it can be used as money depends on the community agreeing to give it or accept it for fiat cash, goods and services. Even the value of BTC is a result of consensus.
If no one wants BTC and it fades into nothingness, that would be community consensus as well.

The number of places where you can spend it and thing you can buy with it are extremely limited. This may improve with time, but right now, it's not great. 
Exchanging fiat for Bitcoin it is neither simple nor cheap. Few employers will pay salaries in Bitcoin. Maybe one day it'll be easier to get and salaries will commonly be paid in Bitcoin, but it may never happen.
It's not as user friendly as cash, and until we get to the point where we tap a hardware wallet and it pays via NFC, it won't be. You can teach a monkey to understand the concept of "buying" things by exchanging tokens. I doubt you could teach a monkey how to pay for something with Bitcoin. 
It's slow, and sometimes costly to transact and Lightning Network is far from ready. Until it's actually ready and functioning, it's too soon to pin all our hopes on it. 
If you don't have internet access, it's not really useful. I've listened to Andreas talk about all the ways it could be sent by satellites or fencing wire or HAM radio, but that's all theoretical. It's not there yet and it may never happen.
Don't get me wrong, I think Bitcoin and crypto is an amazing new development, but it's still very, very rough around the edges and it might turn out that all of the coins around today end up at zero and a coin to be the new global standard may not have even started development.

Thanks for the information, but it's not quite as well known as you might think. 
Perhaps among the old school BTC users who are deep into the tech, it's well known and a rookie mistake, but many people now are not as technologically inclined. 
Bitcoin interfaces are going to have to become more secure and easier to use and understand in order to gain widespread adoption because most people are never going to be highly tech literate or spend much time keeping, abreast of how to secure funds.

I think it's still a pain to buy with fiat. The difficulty is fine if we intend to buy and hold it like gold, but it's enough of a hassle that I don't want to use it as money.
If it were somehow possible for miners to sell BTC directly to the public on a web store or even a physical retail shop, that could be cool. I don't know what laws or restrictions would prevent that happening, but I'd like to be able to buy it at the convenience store or at a currency exchange kiosk. Bitcoin ATMs ask for way too high of a premium, IMO.

There was a lot of excitement, but personally I don't think people should be getting so excited about more speculative investors.
If BTC is just for holding and the main selling point is the gains which people are hoping will come from "institutional investors" or "Wall Street money" then people are putting an awful lot of trust in other people to make their "trustless" coin gain value.
I'm not a BCH proponent, but as fairly neutral, objective 3rd party (I have trace amounts of both coins, but not enough to change my life or care about), I have to give the BCH community credit for getting out there and growing up their own community and getting people actually using the coin as a way to transfer value person to person.  
Like all reasonable people, I laugh at Roger Ver's childish tantrums, disapprove of the claims of being "the real Bitcoin", and disingenuous efforts to confuse newcomers, but I can't deny that their real world efforts and progress toward real adoption as a currency are the way a cryptocurrency should grow.

It's interesting that I'm not seeing a lot of comments talking about $3000 anymore. Prior to that really long, flat period, there were still a lot of voices talking about $5400 and $3000.
Maybe people are really feeling like this is the floor. 
That said, bear in mind that the Mt. Gox payouts are coming. It is better that they're giving the BTC to the claimants directly, than selling to give them cash, but I also think a lot of claimants are going to want to take some profits.
@_date: 2018-10-14 19:45:18
The fees you pay when buying and selling on Kraken are a % of the trade. This is charged by Kraken to make money and pay their staff etc.
When you withdraw BTC the fees are mostly just Bitcoin network transaction fees, paid in Bitcoin. (Depending on what you've been told, it isn't actually free to send Bitcoin to a different address.)
When you do your own transactions, it might be cheaper than Kraken, because you can choose your own fee rate. Kraken may choose a fairly high fee rate to ensure their transactions go through quickly.

Haven't casascius coins been shut down? Your concern may be part of the reason why. 
Print-wise It's possible to get thousands of those glossy plastic hologram stickers for a few hundred bucks, I think they just use a laser to print directly onto the foil, so that's definitely an option.
The holograms that they used, at least on the coin shown on Wikipedia look pretty weak, IMO. 
AFAIK, the old 3D holographic images like the eagle on Visa cards require an actual 3D model of the object to be shot with lasers from different angles on a special isolation platform that's completely immune to the tiniest vibrations. If casascius coins were sealed with a hologram (especially if it was a DIY hologram and not produced in a factory) of a particularly detailed and unique custom object (for example a half-rotted zombie porcupine with lots of holes and quills etc.), it could be a lot harder to reproduce, because they would need to perfectly replicate your unique 3D object and all the other conditions of your holographic photo shoot, like angle and laser intensity, in order to even approximate your hologram.
On another note, do the coins have a public key that isn't covered by a hologram?
To help your scam, you could put a dummy public key on the outside and keep however many coins were supposed to be in it in public key, to which you kept the private keys.  Of course you might need to put 1-1000 BTC in an address that you couldn't touch until the scam was over.

Really, the PCM bank issue is about corruption, which is not partisan, it exists in the most capitalist countries as well as socialist ones. It's also about people trusting banks, which again, isn't about left or right.
I mean, you can frame it that way and lay blame with the left because it suits your political beliefs, at the same time there are folks who will frame it as right wing capitalist crooks making this happen.
The thing is, while you and your opponents get all riled up and argue on Reddit, the real villains aren't even taking sides on the left or right like you or the other side, they're aligning themselves with any and all who can make them richer and there are those people on both sides.
@_date: 2019-08-31 09:01:18
Well, yeah a latecomer in the sense that you started buying pretty much at the peak of the bubble and rode out the bear.  That's only part of a cycle. 
You were barely a participant in the market when it was a bull market, so I think your perspective is skewed a bit more negatively than people who have been there through ups and downs. You were here for the biggest (longest) down there has been, and nothing else. 
Perhaps that's it and crypto is a failed experiment that's going to zero, but if it isn't, then the upside potential is far greater than anything we've seen so far.
Edit: That said, you say anyone over the last 2 years is fucked, but that's not true at all. People who got in before you are good, people who got in any time over the last 12 months are good, too. There have only been a couple of months where Bitcoin was over 10k in its 10 years. Unfortunately for you and many others, they bought in during those crazy few months.

It may not ever get you money. The idea is that it _is_ money, although it's not a widely accepted form of money, yet. Just as you can't pay with a gold nugget at KFC because they would not accept it, you also can't pay with bitcoin directly at many places.
We're all hoping and expecting that to change down the road, since it works a lot better than gold nuggets.

Being non-seizable is good, seriously it's an admirable feature and it has a lot of long and short term advantages, but if the authorities can prove you have it, it's possible you could be forced to turn it over or face prison time, depending on the laws of the country and how it was framed.

Because no one wants to hold their fiat at all. 
Crypto prices reflect supply and demand. Demand isn't universal in all regions. 
Basically that 10-15% premium reflects how little people want to hold the local fiat in those regions. If no one wanted to pay the premium, the price would drop.

You asked why they would pay over the CMC price for BTC, and my answer was that it was the same reason as people pay more for similar apartments in NYC.

If there's an impediment to arbitrage with the world bitcoin market for whatever reason, then it is expressed as a supply and demand imbalance, which is the same as the apartment analogy.
There's less demand for Pittsburgh apartments and less demand for BTC in the west.
There are more people who demand BTC in Venezuela and apartments in NYC than there are apartments and coins available.
If there isn't a premium and it's all an imprecise artifact of hyperinflation then obviously it's another story, but Venezuelan Redditors have said people often use USD to buy the coins, so I'd say the premium is real.

I'm not highly technical, so I'll be general here, but even just freezing the global economy for a day would e devastating.
By the time BTC was the backbone of the global economy, I'd imagine LN would be used heavily. 
Feel free to correct me, I haven't actually used LN and my understanding of it might be incorrect, but assuming billions of channels were already open and funded when the attack started, all transactions that took place during the attack would seem to go through and be completed, but when a channel was closed, it may not be processed, or it could be double spent. If there were certain well funded nodes that a lot of transactions passed through, I imagine it would affect a lot of people.
I wonder if a rogue nation could coordinate a 51% attack with a hack/physical sabotage to cut the power supply to key lightning nodes (and major mining farms) and force them to go offline at the worst moment. 
It could reduce the cost and the time that they would need to sustain the attack.

As far as I understand, wallets are different to addresses and one wallet may contain several addresses.
If the receiving addresses stayed the same and received the BTC and never did anything, I believe the fees would be the same.
However if the 10 Bitcoins were in the same *wallet* under *different addresses*, then the 5+5 would be cheaper than the 5×2.

Everyone has a different tolerance and requirements. 
I think doubling the block size now would mean reliably faster and cheaper transactions.
I'm not a big fan of BCH, but as of right now, it does have some advantages over BTC in terms of usability. A carefully considered block size increase would erase those advantages and make BCH an irrelevant, unnecessary coin. 
The market has chosen BTC, but the market can always shift again. From what I can see, BCH is actually making progress in adoption and use. I don't see why BTC from its position of dominance, wouldn't want to eliminate the competition.
@_date: 2019-02-22 11:05:27


First of all, define "everyone", because if it's literally everyone, I think that's when a bull run would start. People talk about "smart money" but I don't believe "smart money" always moves contra to the rest of the market. 
Second of all, there are different stages of a bull run. A bull run could start if _everyone_ expects to to happen. But once it's going, there will be different groups. People who were in early who think it will go higher. People who were in early who want to take profits. People who were skeptical but have decided to dabble. People who want to short it to death. I think markets reverse depending on timing of when certain actions by these groups happen.

I don't think BCH itself is necessarily bad. It's an option for those who want big blocks.
But the pumps are pretty suspect. The timing and the way they suddenly appear without any apparent basis (such as a high profile endorsement or CME or anything like that) makes it look like market manipulation, rather than organic natural growth. 
The coin has spent most of its short life on a downward trend with occasional and unnatural pumps. I don't hate it, but I'm just not confident of it as a secure place to park my money. 
That said, it's all in the game, right? Bitcoin isn't governed by a single entity, so essentially it's supposed to be self-governing. And if they can get the pump to stick, I guess they're just playing the game with the tools they have available.

It really depends on the users. If most BTC holders collectively refuse to sell or drop prices, then supply will dry up and the price will stabilise. You can already see that it's not dropping like a stone, so there are still plenty of buyers at each level waiting to grab coins. I'm one of them. But if there simply aren't that many coins up for sale, the buyers are going to have to pay more.

Yes and no. The first weekend they did the pump and Bitcoin dropped and people were freaking out. In some of my over the counter chat groups people were talking about cashing out or buying BCH in case.
The second weekend they still pumped BCH, but BTC buyers weren't fazed - no one wanted to be fool who panic sold at 5500 this time around then see it bounce back to 8000 a day or two later.
I do agree that Bitcoin has a weakness in the transaction/mempool slowdown. I hope segwit adoption continues, especially with exchanges.

Yeah, basically Bitcoin has consistently been the safest bet. 
But certain alts jump at certain times. They're far more erratic and volatile than Bitcoin. That's largely to do with maturity, I think. 
Bitcoin years ago behaved like alts do today, so there's every chance a few of today's alts will shoot up one day. Do some research and choose one that has a function or use case that you can really get behind. 
Personally, I like XRP. I can understand their plan and I like their approach. Many crypto fans don't, and that's fair enough. I've put some money in there and I can wait a few years for it to find its feet.

Good question. I guess if the global economy was running on Bitcoin, we would not want a pariah nation like North Korea to be able to hold the world hostage. 
No idea how much hash power NK would be able to muster/rent if they wanted to. I think if it would benefit them at this point, there are a few nations that could do a 51% attack.
For example, I think China could manage it at the current hash rate without too much trouble. But there's just no point or advantage for them to do it right now.

This is a place you'll find pro Bitcoin information, so bear that in mind if you want both sides of the story. 
As for "terrible" or whatever, it's going to depend on what you consider important, so it's a matter of opinion. 
One point of fact which is not up for discussion, however, is that Bitcoin is the original Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is a recent offshoot. It's underhanded and dishonest for anyone to suggest otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:09:27
I don't think they're idiots, aside from the toxic loud mouths on r/btc, and all communities have those jerks. 
BCH does appear to be functioning pretty well as an everyday currency, and there are plenty of reasonable people who simply dig the functionality of BCH. 
I'm not a huge fan, but I have a little that I got when they forked. I haven't bought any since, while I kept buying BTC. I don't think BCH is horrible, I just don't want to park a lot of my money in a currency that spends more time going down than up. If that changes, I might consider grabbing more. 
I don't see why one must die and one must take over. People seemed content with BCH and BTC coexisting when 2x was on the horizon, but once that failed the narrative changed and it was BCH's job to usurp BTC. Not sure why one people are so desperate for BTC to die and be replaced. Peaceful coexistence is my jam. Or maybe that's just reddit. 
I don't know how relevant BCH will be once segwit is more widely adopted or lightning network launch, but I think by then it will have its own market and eco system.

Depends on what your idea of "moon" is. 
If it hits $100,000-300,000 (rivalling gold) only people with 10+ bitcoins are going to be millionaires. And being a millionaire isn't what it used to be. A guy who owns a local donut shop that does well might be a millionaire. 
From what I understand, around half of all wallets contain 0-1 bitcoin. Of course we don't know how many wallets an individual has, but it's the only information we have. 
So with lots of people buying in for $100-5000 these days, I don't think it's going to look like a complete wealth upset, it's going to look more like a bunch of people got an inheritance.
If you think Bitcoin's going to hit 5 million each... well I just don't think it's going to happen. (But I'd be very happy if it did.) 
Also, for me, Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. I like it because it removes the restrictions of fiat money so I can move my money anywhere I want easily, and it's inflation resistant. If bitcoin would just appreciate enough to mitigate inflation, that would be all I need. I don't want my savings to shrink because the central banks want to increase cash flow. Massive surges are the icing on the cake. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:20:57
No one knows the best time to buy. There is a fork coming up which could result in a price drop or sky-rocketing. 
One option is to spend half now and half after the fork, regardless of whether it rockets. That way you have some either way, and if it does drop you won't be caught unable to buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:15:51
Oh, you mean stop using it temporarily? 
I'd stop if I needed to pay more than 4% of my total transaction if it was small (sub 1000) or more than 1% if it was large.
But I try not to rely on Bitcoin absolutely for any transactions that's urgent and crucial. That way if there is a glut like this, I can wait it out. It's not ideal, but it's a work in progress and I think the devs will sort it out, eventually. 
If they don't, I would only use Bitcoin as a store of value like gold and I'd say $100 was the ceiling. If it got much more than that I'd switch to another cryptocurrency.

It hit people who had borrowed too much and people who had bought houses for the purpose of flipping them for cash.
Not blaming people for chasing money but I think there is a lack of practical financial education.

I would suggest trying to buy some person to person (not face to face, online) through Paxful or something.
Then try to put it onto an exchange like Kraken and sell it.

Yes and no. It's more quantifiable than the money sitting in a traditional bank, but it doesn't mean it's using more than that. Some of the Chinese mines are situated next to hydroelectric dams and buy electricity wholesale. 
@_date: 2019-06-03 02:41:05
A minor difference. OK, if you put your own card in and expected to see a balance of $800 but it showed $800,000 because the bank somehow accidentally created two accounts with the same account number, do you think you'd be entitled to the money?

In some countries like China, you can't trade fiat currency for cryptocurrency on an exchange. But you can purchase digital assets with fiat OTC. If Tether's reserves are not strictly dollars, there may be other fiat in there.

I'm not dreaming of being  a millionaire, I made this post because I'm actually concerned that lots of people are going to get rich suddenly and fuck it up. Like Mike Tyson buying 33 Rolls Royces and tigers and then going bankrupt a few years later. 
I see people talking about Lamborghinis and yachts and whole I know it's a joke, it would also be sad to see the wealth created by Bitcoin all flow back to the same establishment that has maintained status quo for so long.

Oh well, things grow and change, especially when they're open source and you disappear and leave it to the community.
I'm not saying the store-of-value concept is a good or a bad thing, just that what Satoshi wanted doesn't matter any more. He's not here and he disappeared a long time ago. Either he doesn't care or he's dead so he doesn't care.
It's a free market and if the store-of-value use isn't viable, then we'll find out, eventually.

@_date: 2017-11-24 04:10:53
Sure, but that's their prerogative. There are plenty of shitty altcoins out there. Any one of them could try to usurp Bitcoin if they wanted. It's an unregulated market and anyone is allowed to do that. A change from the traditional system comes with its own risks. 
Bitcoin needs to be able to withstand attempts from people doing bad things. If it can't survive a handful of rich guys trying to game the system, how is it ever going to survive if the big banks come after it? 
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:11:14
Yes, but basically this is a service which could be collecting active addresses for dusting attacks or monitoring/IP matching. I'd rather just keep it between the transaction counterpart and myself.
If someone wants my address, they can climb onto blockchain.info and get it themselves, rather than me giving it to them.
How do I know this service won't one day start giving out its own addresses as the shortened addresses the way some address generators do?
Go ahead and use it if you like, but there are too many risks for my liking.

Picture this, Mr. E. Whale spent 100m buying BTC over the counter when it was 3200-3400.
Now, he conspicuously puts in another 100m on public exchanges at 3700, deliberately pumps it to 4400. His average price is 3600 and he's now holding 60,000 BTC. 
Because of his deliberate, public pump, shorts get squeezed and the algorithm trading bots try to go with the flow, pushing it up to 5000.
Mr. E. Whale's 60000 BTC thay cost him $200m is now worth $300m
He can short it, dump it, crash it back to 3800 and do the whole thing over again, but this time he'll have an extra $100m+ to spend.
Not saying that's what actually happened/will happen, but it's certainly possible.

No hard feelings and if I'm at a friend's house and he passes a joint I'd probably have a puff. I just got what I wanted out of them (satisfied curiosity) and don't need them. I barely even drink.

Price is decided by supply and demand.
There are people buying, but not that many and they're not outbidding each other to get the coins. And there are people selling, but they're not desperate enough to offer them for less to get rid of them. 6400-6500 is the price point that buyers and sellers are happy to trade at.

Not saying it will come to pass, but here's a possible future. 
If Bitcoin eventually becomes valuable enough for widespread use widely held, it would also likely be widely accepted. 
Widespread adoption will likely stabilise the price somewhat, but it would continue rising, although slower than its first 10 years, due to its deflationary nature. Maybe 5-10% a year? 
The type of who have savings accounts in fiat today may at that stage wish to hold all their savings in BTC as it increases in value rather than decreasing like fiat, but of course when it comes to spending it, they would spend BTC because that's all they own.

If Binance exit scams, I would say "SYFL" and "funds are safu heh heh."
Edit: Bitcoin will go to $1 if everyone starts panic selling. I don't know if Binance exit scamming would cause people to suddenly sell theirs.
If Binance really wanted to exit scam, they should let people keep trading, but quietly shift coins out of the wallet and start selling off their funds on other exchanges. Delay withdrawals until people start asking questions. By that point they've already profitted from the scam they just have to wait until it's discovered.
That said, an exit scam would be risky. CZ has made himself too visible and well known. If he exit scammed, people could find him or recognise him in the street. Maybe he should sell Binance then exit scam and blame the new owners.

@_date: 2018-11-10 02:52:21
That's supply and demand at work. Right now it's pretty balanced. A bearwhale dropping 30k BTC would create an excess supply.
That said, at this point, if sellers are exhausted and people are mostly hodling or waiting it out, if the bearwhale's intention is to drop the market deeper and rebuy cheaper, he's running a risk. If most other sellers refuse to panic, he's only going to trigger a few stop losses and he may not be able to get a full on panic dump to buy.
Everyone likes $13,000 more than $6200 but there seems to be less fear and more confidence at this point.
$13,000 = "Oh my god, is it going to drop lower? When is this bear market going to end? The agony!"
$6200 = "I'm down 70%, but I'm just going to wait it out and DCA."

When there are more sellers than buyers, buyers get to be more choosy and they want to pay less, so they offer less. Sellers are desperate to sell and get their cash, so they compete with each other and offer their coins for lower and lower.
For example, if I want to buy a coin today, I saw that it dipped under $5000, so I'd put up a buy order for $4800 if I thought I was going to dip back there again, because why pay $5100 if you can pay less?

How did we contact people in 1985?
We called or wrote letters. Maybe sent faxes in the case of businesses. 
It was expensive to make long distance calls and Telecom companies held a monopoly. The post was slow because it was physical.
How has the internet technology transformed communication?
Now we can do video calls directly for free with Skype, Facetime etc.
We send messages for free by email, Facebook or Wechat. Even Telecom companies now use VoIP to connect their customers.
How did people become stars in 1985?
They auditioned or got picked out by talent scouts. There was a gateway that people had to go through, and was abused many times over by the gatekeepers. Nepotism, favouritism or demanding sexual favours in exchange for a shot at success were the norm.
Now that situation still exists, but we also have people who are literally self made stars because the internet gave them a platform. Pewdiepie and Tess Munster would probably not have broken out in the old system.
We can now produce what we want and consume what we want. HBO and Disney are still dominating entertainment, but there's also a thriving alternative entertainment industry run by the people.
How has the internet changed money?
It hasn't really. There are apps and you can use a credit card online, but the apps are just a veneer over odd school banking technology and buying with a credit card online is the same as it was with TV shopping in the 90s.
We've finally figured out a way to put money in the internet and into the hands of the people, and that's cryptocurrency.

I know the discovery rate is relatively stable. That's not what I'm getting at.
I'm just saying people are assuming the halvening will result in rising prices (TBH, I think it's likely, too) for 2 reasons.
1. Fewer bitcoin hitting the market.
2. History of price rises around the time of a halvening.
But 2. is based on a very small sample size, so it's far from concrete proof. It's 3 for 3, which is 100%, but it's also only 3 occasions. Always a chance for a surprise upset. 
Number 1. is more tangible, but for reduced supply to push the price up, the daily demand needs to outstrip the daily supply, right? If the market is still bearish at the halvening, the demand may not outstrip supply, at least not immediately, which would mean mining costs would stay the same, but profits would be halved. Miners would drop out of mining, but that didn't have any effect or correlation with price this time.
Basically, I'm just saying it's entirely possible the halvening will come and go and not affect the price.

I think your understanding of the differences between different digital assets needs to be developed.
POW "pure" cryptos like Bitcoin are mechanically and philosophically very different from ERC 20 and other, similar tokens, and their purpose and function is totally different.

In that sense, they have painted themselves into a corner with their very concept.
Twitter is free enough for people who aren't horrible degenerates.
Just like America calls itself land of the free, there are things that Americans are not free to do, like taking cocaine, yet for most Americans, they consider the country effectively free, because they don't have any desire to take cocaine. 
Free speech is a fine ideal when we think about using it for heroic reasons like exposing corruption and calling out politicians, but if we extend completely to absolutely all speech, we have to accept it includes dehumanising people, descriptions of violent racism, graphical pedophile literature etc. 
In that case, I think Twitter succeeds because it does allow the heroic uses of free speech while sparing people exposure to the rantings of Nazis etc.
Yes, the management of Twitter means one day it _could_ begin to censor things in the fashion of an authoritarian government, but why switch to a platform full of racists for fear of a vague and unlikely development. 
Anyway, if the government started controlling Twitter to restrict free speech, they'd probably just shut down gab's site while they were at it.
@_date: 2019-01-06 04:02:54
Well Facebook doesn't dominate all of social media. Twitter, Instrgram, YouTube and others have all carved out their own niche (who owns the company isn't relevant, here).
So it's not a winner take all situation. I think there's room for other coins, but a clone of bitcoin offers nothing new and you're competing directly against bitcoin that already has a 10 head start.
Like IG, YT, Twitter etc. a new coin needs to serve a different purpose to bitcoin and demonstrate its value and strengths in order to get a piece of the pie.
Edit: Getting in early goes for everything, not just crypto. Getting into a Silicon Valley start up can make you wildly rich too. But now that the market has matured, not every tech start up is getting millions thrown at them. 2017 in crypto was like the dot com boom - people hearing stories of people getting rich and throwing cash at any chance. It was a gold rush.  There will be malinvestment and scams in future, but I think crypto has matured a bit and people are going to be more skeptical and scrutinise where they put their money.

It was an example of something I don't believe in, but wouldn't bet against in the short term. 
I'm saying people could believe crypto is a joke/scam/going to zero but still acknowledge that it might shoot up again before dying, hence not liking it AND not wanting to short it.
I'm not a crypto hater, but there are coins that I think are garbage and are going to fade away, but I wouldn't short any of them because I'm not sure they won't go up in price before dying.

For a lot of people, the realization that if you bought $5 worth of BTC in 2010 you'd be a multi millionaire now probably sparked interest.
Although it had been true for a while, early 2017 was when the 2014 bear market was firmly in the rear view. Until then, it could have been a sucker's rally and it might have dropped further.
Just like the people were telling everyone about crypto in 2017 have now clammed up, even though they hold out for a recovery, crypto people in 2014 clammed up until the bear market was well and truly over and the trajectory was an upwards one, before they started telling people again.
I think if BTC can slowly and steadily get back up to $10k, people will start publicly evangelising it again and the curve will go upwards sharply.

I guess most people think Twitter is already free-speech Twitter because they *do* say whatever they want and don't get banned for it.
I mean, why would anyone join a Twitter alternative that is inferior, in that it has fewer users to interact with and little other than unpleasant posts and very little that I actually want to read?
The only thing it offers is something I don't need - the freedom to say reprehensible things.
I'm not taking Twitter's side - I have never actually used Twitter at all. But until Twitter gives normal people cause for concern, no one will care about an alternative.

It's not a big deal to pay more if you intend to sell OTC as well. The premium goes both ways.
Edit: 
Buying in bulk works for products in a store, but think, if you had 1 Bitcoin for sale today, would you accept 5% below exchange prices? That would be $6056. You're losing $300. If you were selling 1500 Bitcoins at -5% you'd be losing half a million dollars.
Who wants to get rid of their Bitcoins so urgently that they'd take a half million loss when they don't have to?

@_date: 2017-09-27 19:14:10
I don't think bitcoin is a bubble because bubbles come about when the market starts paying more for something than it is worth. But because bitcoin is a currency of sorts (let's not argue semantics - it is used for buying, selling and saving) so it is inherently worth the price people are paying for it.
Furthermore, the wider the adoption is, and the higher the entry point, it gets further away from a total collapse and failure. Most ICOs suck because 50 people buy a hundred bucks worth hoping to strike the next bitcoin, but the coin offers little advantage over other major coins, aside from a very low entry price. A few months later, demand hasn't materialised and those 50 people eat a regrettable, but ultimately insignificant, $100 loss. 
For bitcoin to collapse like that we would need millions of people (many of whom bought in at $4000 or more) to collectively decide they're just going to let it go. Highly unlikely. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:24:57
Well, there are the doom and gloomers and the people always hoping for a bull run, but I'm expecting a very long period of sideways action.  We could be in it now and BTC might hover between 3200-3800 for most of the year (or maybe a few years) before a slow and tentative recovery.

If this is true, I doubt they would trade it all at once and push the price up. If they're in a rush to get rid of their USD, they could buy some BTC but to avoid pumping the price, use their USD to buy stablecoins and set lots of buys around $3800 and accumulate while creating a floor.

I'd say that if they're self-censoring, it's for social reasons, rather than avoiding Twitter bans.  
What kind of weirdo goes on social media and decides not to write something for fear of being banned by the moderators? 
Learning self-censorship through social interactions is an important part of a child's social development and it's also part of how we develop morals. We learn what kind of things are socially acceptable and we learn how to express contrasting opinions in a socially acceptable way. Admittedly, some people's development falls behind or is skipped over, entirely. 
A lack of that social awareness is precisely why Borat was so funny, and it's funny to think that gab is filled with people who think they're brave visionaries, but they're actually real life angry Borats.

Sorry, but your son sounds like an idiot. December was ridiculous, and buying anything that just quadrupled in value in about 5 weeks was a recipe for disappointment. . 
Last November and December, I had friends and family coming to me who I had advised in early 2017 to get some Bitcoin. When I first mentioned it, it was around $1800-2000, but they shrugged it off, but started coming to ask me for help when it was 7k up to 20k. I refused them and told them it was too risky and a terrible time to buy. 
If any of them had taken my advice at the time I had offered it, they would still be up a decent amount now, and even now after all the tumbles, they could cash out with a smile.

Thanks for the response. 
Yes, I am a new redditor, but I've had an interest in Bitcoin for much longer, although I admit I'm not much of a geek and I don't understand all the intricacies of the difference between btc and bch. Not to say I don't understand any of it at all, but I'm going to try to get into a debate with someone who seems to get it. I get how transaction times are affected by blocksize and how segwit is a way to deal with it, but when the developer jargon starts to flow, I'm lost. 
The thing is, I was holding my bitcoin happily and getting on with my life while keeping an eye on the value and major developments. Then one day it turns out I have some bch as well. Great, free money!
I've only started paying attention to the social media side of crypto currency since the mid-year surge and I was kind of surprised by how much bickering there is. I mean bch is already out and it exists, for people to still be ragging on it and wishing it fails seems kind of petty. (Same as the bch guys who rail against core). If a coin is superior, surely that will shine through, and if an inferior coin thrives, well, is it a big problem? Crypto has so far to go before it's a zero sum game. Right now it's like 2 starving guys fighting over a piece of bread
@_date: 2019-01-23 10:26:57


Agreed. While a lot of people now would at least have heard of it, some will just note the name and move on, others will dive deeper to learn about it, some will decide its not for them, others will jump in. I think there's still a fair way to go before there is a saturation point, but I don't think it's going to be something 100% of the world's population uses. 


If it's neutral or positive, I think people are much more willing to spend it/use it as money, which I would characterise as adoption. 
When the market is bearish and people are down on their original buy in, people are either holding on waiting for a recovery or exiting their trading positions.  Once sellers have sold and the price is too boring for traders, and HODLers have accepted their losses and new people have not experienced significant loss, assuming it doesn't just keep on falling to $0, then the price can rise.

Right, but the more people who join the bitcoin economy, and the more they pay, the less likely they are going to just abandon ship and consider them worthless. Sure, there might be frightening drops, but most people who bought in at $5000 and are sitting on a loss right now are aware that Bitcoin has recovered from massive drops to reach new highs. I can't really see millions of people collectively just deciding that the coins they spend thousands on are worthless. It would need ongoing negative news coverage, ongoing rigorous government crackdowns and deep, sustained price drops with little hope of recovery. Even then, I think there would still be people who wanted in and now have a lower price barrier.

A bubble is when the item is overpriced but people keep buying and pushing the price higher. 
But Bitcoin is valued by its value, so it's kind of impossible to call it a bubble. 
Although, if it was rising because of demand which came from being bought for altcoins, I might call that a bubble, because people weren't really wanting the bitcoin for its own value or even real use, and as soon as exchanges offer fiat-altcoin pairs, bitcoin would no longer be needed.
That might be happening a little here with people wanting to stock up on btc in the hope of free BTCgold and 2X tokens, but only to some extent. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:12:25
I hope so too. I also bought some around $4400 when it peaked last time and I have been regretting it for the past month. But at the end of the year it's probably going to look like a great bargain. 
In the end I have faith that bitcoin is here to stay. Even if early adopters cash out big, the people holding the bag aren't going to want to lose all that money and as long as there are enough long term holders I think it has a future. Anyone who freaks out about it has historical data to convince them that the pain is temporary and it will rise again. Each time it collapses and rises again is, in the long term, an argument for bitcoin, rather than against.

He's not talking about open source community projects like Bitcoin that are about people creating an independent,decentralized form of money, he's talking about ICOs - for profit commercial projects that are asking people to pay real money for a virtual token so their business can have money. They're businesses and they should be subject to the same scrutiny as other businesses that raise funds in other ways.

Lately, I've been going through a massive headache related to purchasing an apartment in a foreign country. My ass is getting absolutely torn to pieces by all the nickel and diming from the banks as I try to move my money from my home country account to the place where I'm buying.

When I was a kid in 1987, a popsicle cost $0.15
If I had been a good little boy and instead of eating popsicles, I had saved my $0.15 for a rainy day, (in a term deposit with an unrealistically generous interest rate of 5% *and* I somehow avoided paying any tax) after 30 years of annually compounded interest, I would have a whopping $0.65. But with a more realistic interest rate and taxes on the gains, it's more like $0.40.
The problem is, in 2017 a popsicle costs $1.50

I've lived in China for over 13 years. Waphou is grossly underestimating how many people are not in abject poverty. 
He's not entirely wrong, but it seems like a narrow view, which would be understandable if he's always going to garment factories in poor factory towns. That would be like if I went to Detroit and used that as a yardstick for the US. 
China is huge. It's incredibly huge and you really can't make such a broad generalisation. 
1.3 billion people. If 85% of them are poor or working class then the other 15% are rich, that's equal to 2/3rd of the USA being rich.
He's also wrong about people interacting online. I would argue that Chinese people are as wired up as any country. They do way more online shopping than any county I've ever lived in. Decent Android smartphones are really cheap and abundant and data plans are very cheap.

I'm new to reddit and I subscribed to r/btc thinking it was just another bitcoin sub. I'm fairly apolitical regarding BCH, 2X etc. and I just wanted to learn more, but btc was just a nasty place. So I unsubscribed. 
Also, early on, I bought 2 or 3 BCH because I thought it might be a coin with a future (based on what I was reading on r/btc) but I sold them a day later with a total loss of $30 and it's the best $30 I ever lost.

If your account balance is positive, you're in the minority and the bank really needs you. 
I remember one time I closed an account that I hadn't used for years, because I was paying a yearly fee and the bank started pleading with me to stay, offering to waive fees. It wasn't even a huge amount, just $7000.
If you could waive fees, then you should have done that at the start and I never would have taken the money out, dummies.

You'd be surprised. For people who work, live, stay and earn in the same place digital currencies might not mean as much, but the world is increasingly globalised. I come from country A, I live and work in country B and I have just bought property in country C. 
I need to move fairly significant amounts of money around between these 3 countries and traditional means are ridiculous. Banks charge a percentage as a transaction fee and impose their own crappy exchange rate that can add 1c per dollar. If you're moving half a million dollars (quite possible with property), then you're giving the bank $5000 just because. Not for their services - that's a different fee that also adds up to thousands - just because the banks can and do make up their own exchange rates.
I'm not a millionaire who can throw money around easily. I'm basically plowing my life's savings and inheritance into this property. Paying $10000 just to move my own money to another bank, digitally really fucking sucks. The present lack of user-friendliness in crypto is nothing compared to being raped by banks.

A smallish correction in November. Maybe 4700-4800 at the lowest. 
Why? Profit takers have mostly taken their profit and are waiting for the next big milestone. The latest batch of new buyers bought in around the 4700 point and won't want to sell lower than that. Less fearful uncertainty due to btc's history of resilience.
Finish the year at 6800-7200. 
Why? 
I think for most new entrants, there's a reluctance to pay more than 1000 over what it cost a month ago, but when they see it stabilise or start to rise, their hopes of getting a price like last month quickly vanishes. I suspect that's why it does these leaps of around 1000 then stabilises, then leaps again.
Alternative outcome, 13000-20000.
If any of the big financial institutions decide to do more than toe dipping, they'll pay large sums and buy volume quite suddenly.

I've literally always been wrong (not always diametrically opposed to the reality, but never accurate enough to maximise profit) about market movements, so don't listen to me on time and date. 
However if you're a crappy trader like me, acknowledge it and build a strategy that works for you. 
Last fork there was a dip, which everyone expected, but it was earlier and shorter than I expected. Luckily, I caught it because I am aware of my lack of trading skills and I pretty much always have a low buy order on the exchange at all times. I got some btc at $3000 which wasn't the absolute bottom, but I am absolutely happy with that purchase today. 
So, my strategy is to keep cash on the exchange and just keep low orders and watch and if the price drops significantly, I buy. If it drops again even more significantly, I buy more. If I don't have cash when it's really cheap, I find some, for example borrow from friends or family. Never more than I could pay off within a month or so. I've never borrowed more than a month's wages and wouldn't want to.

Bitcoin is a network that's inside the internet. Within the bitcoin network, there are objects called bitcoins. What makes them different from other things on the internet or on computers, they can be moved around like other online objects like videos or emails, but unlike those things, they can't be copied.
Because they can move, but can't be copied, they are a good way of keeping track of stuff/value. Just like money, or poker chips.

It's not quite like how the movies in the 80s represented communism. And the government generally prefers to use restrictions rather than bullets. 
People have been leaving with loads of cash for decades now. That's exactly the capital flight the government doesn't like, but hasn't been able to stop. There are a lot of restrictions that make it a again and difficult to get cash out. But for the truly determined, there are loopholes and workarounds that they use. Like banning Facebook here, they have tolerated the small number of people who have found their way around it, but don't want the majority using it. 
So far, Bitcoin and other crypto make up a tiny portion of that capital flight that is undesirable but tolerated to a degree. The amount wasn't enough to bother the government, but it was super easy and fast and at the rate bitcoin was increasing in value, in a few years people wishing to take millions out of the country could potentially have done it in 20 minutes with a handful of coins. That's a big threat. Plus with the rapid growth of the economy in the past few decades, people truly believe they can get rich quick because they have done it or they have been seeing it all around them all day every day. So when there's an ICO and a huckster making ridiculous promises, a lot of people buy into it. 
I'm not saying your sentiment is wrong, but the idea of China running an extremely oppressive police state is a bit exaggerated.

If we compare it to cellphones, I think we're at the stage when cellphones were really expensive and only serious business people and stock market traders needed them. 
Everyone knew what a mobile phone was in those days, but it didn't seem like something to concern yourself with. 
People who needed them sacrificed huge money on the purchase and use of them. 
People now who want to get into Bitcoin sacrifice time and effort because bitcoin isn't that accessible. It's hard (and potentially non secure) to decide to just start holding bitcoin on a whim.

Keeping coins on coinbase is a bit like keeping your money in a bank (which could close down or something), a bitcoin wallet is like stuffing the cash in your mattress where a burglar could get it.

I appreciate the input, no one should be shitting on you for offering another perspective. 
Yeah, the 5 steps of the bubble can be aligned with Bitcoin. But I wonder if any or many industries it could be compared with that are not bubbles.
Also, just like the tech bubble and the real estate bubble, there is still value to be had and even after it pops it might drop to a level higher than it is now. 
My brother invested in silver for $10 then it surged to $50. Unfortunately he held it and it crashed down to $12 or something. As long as the thing retains some value, if you don't buy the peak you can still come out pretty good. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:52:49
Right, but what's a bitcoin worth if you keep it just to keep it? 
I'm not talking about shitty fiat, but actual useful stuff.

If it wasn't risky it would be a million dollars a coin. And if it ever reaches that point where it's not risky at all, it will be worth a million dollars a coin. 
The way I see it, this exact situation will never arise again.

Just last night, I quickly bought some bitcoin and withdrew it from the exchange to put it on another exchange that I wanted to buy a newly cheap altcoin on, so that's 2 transactions that I wouldn't have done if the crypto situation wasn't as wacky as it is at the moment.

I think you should start with wallet installations rather than a video. 
Make sure they are segwit wallets (but don't tell them about SegWit, not necessary at this point) and then send $4 to one person and have them send $3 to the next person, then that person sends $2 to the last guy who sends $1 back to you. 
Now they all know how to receive and send. You could tell them about confirmations at this time.

Not necessarily. Exponentially more technical, I would agree.
But the process of buying bitcoin is easier than buying gold. 
The process of mining gold is pretty complex too. 
Gold miners buy big machines, dig huge holes in the ground, pull up bits of gold which they have to melt down at very high temperatures, sift out impurities, then cast into ingots. Then they move these to other huge holes in  the ground which are lined with concrete and have special high tech doors.

@_date: 2019-09-20 19:26:09
I won't go into technical details, because there are too many. You can look them up one by one as your understanding develops. 
I will try to give a brief overview of the whole concept. 
First of all, Bitcoin(s) only exist as values within the Bitcoin network. You can't take them out or anything like that. It's purely digital.
The whole system is kind of like an old fashioned ledger. It keeps track of which wallet has how much bitcoin, and if a wallet sends bitcoin to another wallet, it adjusts the ledger to reflect that. 
Miners are like the people who record all the transactions into the ledger. We trust them because there isn't just one, there are many of them all simultaneously competing in a number crunching math puzzle - this activity is called mining. The successful miner will be awarded some bitcoin called a block reward, they also get to be the one who picks the transactions to be performed and they write these transactions into the next block of the chain (or the next page of the ledger, to use the previous analogy). 
They also cooperate by sharing that information with others on the network and that keeps everyone on the network abreast of the current state of things.
So you can't have Bitcoins in your hard disk drive, they aren't files to be downloaded or anything, they're just values assigned to addresses within their own network. You don't hold them, you hold the keys to the address that the bitcoins are assigned to. The key is the means of accessing an address on the network (kind of like having the password to an email address) and through that address you can access them and send them to other addresses. 
The address (it looks like a bunch of letters and numbers, or a QR code that represents those letters and numbers) you can share with people with whom you will transact is called the **Public key**. You can share this the way you might share your email address.
The key that you use to create payments from your address is called a **private key** it's like your email password, your debit card PIN, or your front door key - it should be kept private, otherwise anyone who has it can just send your bitcoin to their own address and you probably won't be able to catch them or prove it.
Understanding wallets - private and public keys is pretty important, you should probably read up on it. If you plan on transacting with bitcoin, you'll need to know it.

@_date: 2017-10-23 04:25:52
Right, that's my point. Shapeshift might work for a while, but I don't think Shapeshift would continue to accept trades from Bitcoin if there was a sustained trend where they had to keep buying the new currency for their reserves but were unable to sell their bitcoin. 
On the exchanges, people will sell if they lose confidence, but they still have to find buyers AND take a loss.
Either way, someone is buying it from you. And then it has value for that person. If they panic sell, the new recipient will have a degree of value.
Look, gold is acting as a store of value, and it's losing some ground to Bitcoin, but it's still holding up pretty well and people are still buying it. Why hasn't gold become MySpace and Bitcoin become Facebook? 
They price might drop, but it's not very similar to simply never using MySpace again and becoming a Facebook user. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:28:09

If Bitcoin hits $100k, it hits $100k, no big deal. People will buy in and buy what they can. 
I remember buying some bitcoin for $2500 just a few months ago and thinking it was expensive and maybe I should wait for a drop. 
I didn't want to pay for it at $3000, it felt too expensive. Then about 2 months later, I bought some for $4100 and thought it was the deal of the century. 
My expectations and tolerance keep adjusting. 
I'm not talking about people getting it for pennies back when it was new, I'm talking a matter of weeks ago. Between monthly pay checks, the amount I considered "cheap" fluctuated wildly.

How about if they sold cards (just like international calling cards that were big a few years back) which were essentially paper wallets. The Load and Verify QR code was visible and the Spend was covered with a scratch'n'win coating? 
Of course you're trusting the issuing party, but if it was issued by McAfee or Norton or some company associated with online security, they might feel at ease. 
The cards could also have a QR that when scanned, prompts your phone to download a wallet app from the app/play store which would watch your public key.
In terms of accessible terminology, I think an email analogy might work better. 
Public key = email address 
Private key = password
Public key = debit card/number
Private key = PIN

Assuming I have 1 Bitcoin, if it goes to $100k next year, I'm selling and putting a down payment on a house. I don't care if it's going to be $10 million in 25 years. $100k in 2020 is way more useful and valuable to me than $10 million in 2044.

When the value was rocketing up because people were getting into it ONLY because they saw it go up and they wanted a piece of the profit, then I would agree that the value that we were seeing increase, was just based on the greater fool theory, rather than actual adoption.

Serious question, as I said, I'm not that much of a computer guy. I understand that my build of Ubuntu might be out of date, but it was only exposed to the internet once when I installed Ubuntu and the bitaddress engine on it (using a Windows computer). Since then it and the computer I use it on have always been used offline for generating paper wallets.
Or were you referring to the computer I use solely to access exchanges?
Either way, I'd appreciate constructive criticism.

Some people say "I'm long Bitcoin", it doesn't mean they have leveraged long, it just means they think it's going to go up.
 But in this case of liquidation, works the same way as a short, but in reverse. 
Example of a long = Bitcoin is $10,000, so you borrow $100,000 to buy 10 BTC (again with $10,000 as collateral). When the price reaches $12,000 per BTC, you sell them for $120,000 and pay back the $100,000, leaving a nice $20,000 for you to pocket.
But if you're wrong, and the price drops like yesterday, the exchange will liquidate your position when it hits $9,000 by taking your $10,000 and selling your 10 BTC for $90,000 to make it the square $100,000 that you borrowed.
I know you know, but for anyone else reading:
Short = You borrow 10 bitcoin with $10,000 collateral, immediately sell them (now you have $100,000) and wait for the price to drop (bitcoin dropped to $8000), you decide to rebuy them (now they only cost $80,000 for 10 BTC) and keep difference (that $20,000 that's left over after rebuying). 
If you're wrong and the price rises, the moment it hits $11,000, the exchange wants its bitcoins back, and your $10,000 collateral is spent paying the extra to buy back these (newly more expensive) bitcoins. So you lose it all.

1. UX for both bitcoin and LN is not good enough for prime time. (This applies to every cryptocurrency.) BTC base layer is slow and expensive but 2nd layer is still teething, this is BTC specific. Not sure how to fix it, but I'm sure there are people working on it. 
2. Obtaining it with fiat is still a pain. Bitcoin ATMs are probably the most noob friendly immediate way, but the premium is pretty high. If BTMs had a 5% premium, that would help. (This applies to every cryptocurrency.) 
3. Lack of merchant acceptance. Seems to be improving, inch by inch. (This applies to every cryptocurrency.) 
4. Security. There's a lot to learn and understand about being your own bank, and one would need to stay abreast of any developments that could be a threat. (This applies to every cryptocurrency.) 
5. Unstable, manipulated market. (This applies to every cryptocurrency.) With time and maturity, I guess this will improve.
6. Energy consumption. Some people are OK with it. I'm OK with it now, but it's a problem on the horizon. I'm curious to see how Ethereum's POS plan works out.

Money is in general, is more or less worthless\* as a resource in itself, it's just for communicating value. Money is a language. 
We use language to facilitate interactions and reach mutual understandings. Two people can be sure they're talking about the same four-legged, black and white milk producing animal when they say "cow". 
A company communicates to the worker the value that the company places on that worker's contributions by paying a wages, let's say $10 an hour.
That worker communicates the value they place on things, using the language of money. Just as a person wouldn't call a cow a horse, people won't pay $50 for a normal cup of coffee.
Communicating value using the language of money is how we all reach a mutual understanding on the value of things. 
So Bitcoin could be dethroned, theoretically,  and better languages could come along, but same with spoken languages. 
Ask yourself why Chinese, English and Spanish are the most widely spoken languages, and ask yourself if they are, in terms of efficient, clear unambiguous communication, the best languages.  The answer would be "no". 
That said, languages evolve. English is more standardised than it was in Shakespeare's time and we're constantly adding efficiency to it (although these additions are often rejected at first) - "U" instead of "you", "nite" as an alternative to "night", people being less fussy about "who" vs. "whom" or ending sentences with prepositions. 
Bitcoin is just another language that can change and grow as its use changes and grows. It could die out like Latin or it could spread to become the defacto second language of value across the world the same way as a Japanese person doing business with a Ghanaian most likely communicate in English, rather than their national tongues. 
Participating in bitcoin gives you the option to participate in value transactions in this language with others. 
\* Gold and silver have practical uses as metals, but in practical use, are not worth as their trade prices suggest. In world where society and social agreements have broken down, would you rather have an ounce of solid gold, or $1200 worth of practical resources like rice/bullets/oil/water?

I don't think it would, at least not in the long term.
If the identity was discovered and he/she's dead, then there would definitely be no change. 
If Satoshi is still alive or is a group, some people may fear that Satoshi's wallet could move and it might mean a million BTC flooding the market and dropping the price, but there's no reason to think Satoshi would wait until this moment to dump coins. Why not last year? Why not when it was $6800? If you can wait 10 years, why not 15? If you need some cash, why not just sell a dozen?

Good post, have an upvote.
That said, I have used both Alipay and Wechat cross-border. There may have been additional fees involved, but the process was as fast and as easy as using it domestically in China. 
I used Chinese Wechat to purchase consumer items in Japan, and I used Alipay to transfer money across a border and directly into a bank account in Thailand.
Edit: Also, I sent a "red packet" to a group chat with people from Europe opening the packet and claiming the Yuan inside. They can't withdraw to a local bank account, obviously, but they can send it to others and spend it inside the Wechat ecosystem.

The $10k goal people were talking about seems harder to reach, so people who bought between 3200-7500 are realizing profits.
Also, the Tether thing is probably causing a lot of uncertainty.
Edit: If you look at 2017, the first half of the year looks fairly similar to this year, a bit of stability, followed by a rapid rise, then running out of steam.  Not saying the second half of 2017 will repeat this year, but it's possible.

Not much has changed since 2017, except the price, and the changes that have had have been  positive ones, LN, wider merchant adoption more wallets etc. 
Despite that, lot of people were basing their positivity on the price (ie: bitcoin didn't get 100% better in December 2017, even though the price jumped 100% in December 2017) and they are basing their negativity on the price drop now, rather than on the fundamentals.

Good question.
I do trust other people/businesses, to a point.
I'd be OK with throwing a Trezor in a safety deposit box, since it has a pin. Or putting half a recovery phrase in one box and another half in another box across town.
My point to OP was more that the special forces aspect doesn't really make a difference. His idea is basically the same as putting your keys in a safety deposit box, but with tougher guards. As far as I'm aware, bank robberies and safety deposit box heists are usually successful because they're inside jobs or well-placed, not because the guards aren't special forces.
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:24:47
The problem with banks isn't that their security guards are not up to the task, it's the issue of trust. 
With this idea, you're still trusting someone not to steal your shit. Special forces guys might be heroes on the battlefield, but who knows what they think of crypto millionaires? It only takes one of the guys to think they're obnoxious nerds who did nothing to deserve the wealth and hatch a scheme to rip off everyone's keys.

I agree completely. But at the same time, even the underlying tech isn't quite ready for prime time, even after almost a decade.
As we saw last year, many crypto businesses were unprepared for the barrage of new users. Exchanges were shutting down and freezing registrations. Lots of confusion from banks and users etc.
So I think in a way, it's best if the next big wave of mainstream interest run doesn't happen for a while.  Stuff like Lightning Network still has a lot of work to be done under the hood as well as the UI, if it's to really to be able to do what PayPal or Wechat Wallet do at present.
Right now it's early adopters and passionate crypto nerds who are building and using this tech and ironing out the kinks. Once that's solid and exchanges and merchants are up to speed, then we can put a nice, Apple-esque, user-friendly interface on it and make it available for all.

You sound like someone who never actually dealt with any of those things in the early days.
The internet was not very user friendly until the first browser around 1990, and even then it was firmly in the domain of geeks and nerds.
Mobile phones in the '80s were clumsy, expensive to buy and expensive to use. Coverage was crap, batteries ran out quickly and you had to remember or have numbers written down. They got better in the 90s, but they were still pretty niche, mainly for people who required them for their jobs - traders, contractors etc., as they offered few benefits to most people and the network effect was minimal. In the LATE '90s they finally became affordable and useful for the general public.
Smartphones were around for a while before the iPhone, but they were expensive to buy and expensive to use (data plans weren't cheap). Blackberry, Nokia, Palm etc. all competed for a very small market of power users.
None of the technologies I named were widely used or very useful in their first 10 or even 20 years, except perhaps smartphones, which were an evolution of the cellphone and even then, still needed close to a decade to mature.

If people start accepting cryptocurrency for goods and services,NOT crypto that's immediately converted to fiat, and people start spending cryptocurrency on goods and services, and things become priced in cryptocurrency, not just the fiat equivalent denominated in crypto, then manipulators will no longer control the narrative.
Currency of any type is a means of communicating value. Like any language, the people using it can bend the gatekeepers to their will simply by using the language on their terms among themselves.
If a kid mows lawns in his neighborhood for $10, he could also stick a fixed, flat rate for cryptocurrency payments. Let's say 100k sats. He keeps this rate, even if bitcoin rises and falls (let's say $2000 on either side of where it is now) and he's just pegged the price of Bitcoin, at least a little bit.
If enough people do this and use it like this, the price on exchanges will have less and less meaning.

Miners are still mining new bitcoins every day and they are selling them all the time to pay for their mining operations.
Bitcoin early adopters who got in for $1 or less are still up 30000% or more, they can sell any time that they need cash.
Traders are always angling for a deal so they will buy and sell all the time, regardless of price.
Lots of people got into bitcoin in 2017 at $1500-4000 so they may sell when they are at break even or near it if they want to exit the bear market. 
Also, as bitcoin grows, more people want to own or use bitcoin, they have to get it from somewhere. If fewer people are willing to sell, the buyers will start offering more until someone is willing to sell. That's price movement.

There are some similarities up close, especially from the miners' perspective, but zoom out and the difference is more apparent. 
Diablo gold miners were exploiting a video game that was ultimately controlled by Blizzard. Blizzard could have shut the whole thing down or issued every player a billion gold pieces, if they wanted. Also, outside of Diablo players, the gold had no purpose.
With Bitcoin, there are other, although similar use cases. 
Short term use is when I use it to transfer money across borders without going through a bank.
I suppose I could buy/subscribe to Diablo, use $10000 USD to buy gold, then sell it in Vietnam for Dong, but it seems riskier and more complicated to me, a non-player.
Long term, the goal is to be able to be paid in Bitcoin at your job and store Bitcoin in a wallet rather than a bank, and be able to spend Bitcoin to pay bills and buy stuff. Not saying that's going to happen 100%, but it's already happening to a very small degree.  I can't see that ever happening with Diablo gold or any other in-game currency that the developers could just create more of, on a whim.

No, the number shows how many addresses have more than one bitcoin, the number is accurate.
If you're using it as an indicator of how many PEOPLE have more than one bitcoin, then it's very hard to say, the number might even be smaller. People with only one bitcoin might spread it across a 100 addresses, but people with 100 bitcoins might spread it across 100 addresses. We really have no way to know.

One thing I think butt hurt cryptocurrency fans forget when they blame everything on whales, is that whales are also taking risks and gambling when they make moves. 
When volume is very low, it becomes cheaper, therefore less risky, to move the price up OR down, since when there's a lot of activity, a whale could end up just selling into or buying from an indifferent crowd, or just getting canceled out by another whale making an opposing move.
All through 2018 when volume dropped very low, we usually saw a dump. I think around Christmas, those people attempting to manipulate the market were finding that dumps were giving diminishing returns and at $3200 people still holding were more likely to hold to zero than sell.
So, volume was low and shaking the tree wasn't dropping fruit, it's time to go in the other direction. Wait for the lowest volume and buy a big chunk on very visible public exchanges and get all the bots to FOMO and pump it higher.

In 2013 it peaked at about $1100 then crashed hard. In early 2017 it finally reached $1200 and promptly slumped - most likely an exodus of people who were back at break even and didn't want to play any more.
