It’s exactly like an exchange, trading two cryptos between eachother, nothing happens onchain until you withdraw/deposit into the exchange, the exchange themselves hold all the private keys and just shuffle IOUs around

great rebuttal. I like the part where you did not correct him at all and just offered insults. I'm not strongly on either side of the BU/segwit debate yet, but comments like yours really don't help anything.

I didn't just come to that solution/mention it. You did. All I did is state that the current issues with it stem from that

And you don't think that **a)** they can't hire blockchain experts, and **b)** they can't afford a whole bunch of bitcoin?  I'm pretty sure the leading payment service in the world understands that it's almost impossible for them to be the middleman in a peer-to-peer cash system, but with the way bitcoin is going with off-chain transactions and lightning nodes, they will have plenty of other options to step in.

Exchanges wanting to make money.

And? Pretty obvious you made those transactions then at a time when the mempool was empty enough to get through easily. 
But that's not the case a lot of the time, and unless you want to see adoption, there needs to be a lot smaller of a mempool a lot more often, or the fees will be $4 to send $10, which has happened to me many times.
@_date: 2017-08-30 09:40:39
My reply was against the argument that because you add an extra step of getting to an alt coin, it inherently makes the altcoin as expensive as BTC transaction fees
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:46:41
I've thought about this a lot, but in reality all the "big players" that have a disproportionate amount of wealth have already heard about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Those are the people that would drastically affect the price when they put their money in, and they are already familiar with it. 
Sure there's still a lot of room to grow, but it's not as simple as saying "1% of the population knows about crypto, therefore it can grow 100-fold"
@_date: 2017-01-20 00:37:38
it makes complete corporate sense though. Why would they refund such a volatile currency 1:1? Maybe USD would have been a better option when you get a refund, but refunding BTC would allow the system to be abused
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:53:27
Because there's only one transaction fee converting from btc to an alt coin, and once you're in the alt coin, you can make many more transactions at a fraction of the cost.
If you have $5 in BTC, you have at most, three transaction fees in there, if you're sending pennies.
If you convert to an alt coin using services like changelly, shapeshift, you'll spend the first bitcoin transaction fee, the 0.5% exchange fee, and be left with around $3.50-$4 of an alt coin. Which you can make many, many transactions with. That's the point

I have always used localbitcoins. Use someone that has good ratings, and if you want you can meet in person for cash. I've always been able to sell for 2.5-5% less than market, very quickly and easily

Hahaha how far are you? And yes
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:21:41
In local bitcoins there are two sections, people who wish to  sell bitcoin, and people who wish to buy. People want to buy from you at less than market, and sell to you at more than market. Instead of searching for a buyer by saying I'm selling, I just sell to someone that is looking for a seller. This way I can cherry pick someone with good ratings, and at the amount I'm wishing to sell for

You're telling me off for not providing solutions? what is your solution other than telling everyone the problem doesnt exist because you happen to send transactions not at a peak time?
Before you tell someone to shut the fuck up for not bringing anything to the table, bring something yourself first.

[Here is the address with the 0.1BTC.]( Any love for that amazing vanitygen address?
**Make sure if you are downloading the image, the end resolution is 4549x5000 and the file is 19.7MB. Compression of the image may result in not being able to solve the puzzle.**
I will release the solution once someone either takes the bitcoin out of the address, or after a week has passed as I'll then assume no one will have gotten it and I don't want it to just sit there.
If you'd like to be notified of the solution once I release it, reply to this comment :)

* **Figuring out the missing white characters**
   * **Purple Box:** By looking at the purple line that goes through the center of the image, only one pixel wide, you use the X-coordinate that the line is on. ***(2432)***
   * **Green Box:** This one was solved in the comments. [Link]( ***(5763)***
   * **Blue Dots:** A faint image of a dash-dot in the bottom right box hints at morse code. by combining the morse codes of the letters in the blue dots you unveil a number that corresponds to each.
      * TH = -.... = 6
      * SM = ...-- = 3
      * IU = ....- = 4
      * NE = -.. = D

To continue you must use a hex and reveal the name of the faceless."
   * This required some digging but many people were able to realize the mannequin in the picture was the faceless person, and found his name, **"Ned Barman"** on the website.
   * Many people then realized that the letters in NameBrand were very slightly off in colour, and their hex codes followed the format of **"FXFXFX, or FFFXFX".**
   * By using the hex codes in the order of 'NED BARMAN', since it is an anagram, and looking at just the X values, you received the code **"116 / 150 / 33 / 117 / 40 / 33 / 74 / 325 / 34"**
   * Converting these sets from base 10 to base 36 gave the coordinates **"3846X 3914X 2291Y"** which is a line of 69 pixels elsewhere in the image.
   * By doing the same translation to those 69 pixels, you receive **576 56C 6C2 044 6F6 E65 2E2 054 6F2 063 6F6 E74 696 E75 652 C20 796 F75 207 769 6C6 C20 6E6 565 642 046 696 26F 6E6 163 636 920 627 574 206 96E 207 477 6F2 073 746 174 657 32E 2F5 354 415 254 2F5 A74 5A6 C65 347 444 A33 701 655 148 55B 942 418 74E E56 974 642 E32 F45 4E4 42F** which translates to Ascii as **"Well done. To Continue, you will need Fibonacci but in two states./START/ 5A745A6C65347444A3370165514855B94241874EE56974642E3** **/END/"**
* **Combining the data**
   * These 51 characters coresspond to the 51 white charaters inside the rectangles. And fibonnacci in 2 states means the fibonacci sequence in binary. The first 51 characters of which are **" 110111011000110110101100010110111101100110010000111"**
   * **You make pairs between the white rectangle characters and the ones between the /start/ and /end/, e.g. the first four are 35 4A 67 64, and invert the ones that correspond to the zeros in the fibonacci sequence, so now the first four would be 35 4A 76 64.**
   * Once all pairs have been made, convert the pairs from hex to ASCII once more, and you arrive at the private key.
Again congrats to the winner, and thanks to the bitcoin IRC channel, Subreddit, And bitcoin room chat for participating

I am in the process of it, it's a lot harder than it seems. The glass structure is actually part of a different watch it seems, the QR standard requires 'timing strips' connecting the positioning squares, which are alternate black and white pixels. part of this timing strip runs through the top of the 'B', yet that part of the B does not continue the pattern. Right now im breaking down the Data modules and Error Correction modules.
The QR code is also Version 7, which can be derived from the block of 18 pixels just to the left of the upper right positioning square, or just above the bottom left positioning square. This means there are 6 alignment squares in the QR. one in each unoccupied corner, middle, etc. these alignment squares are also not matched to the glass 'B'. I still think theres enough to recover given the error correction though
@_date: 2019-04-15 02:11:38
Hahaha trust me I also knew zero about QR codes like 2 hours ago. This is fun

Yeah it's the exact same when people compare the current price of BTC to the spot price for an oz of gold, they're completely incomparable in that sense but it's tough to explain to people.
