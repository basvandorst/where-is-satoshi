Oh I didnt realize that has anything to do with Bitcoin Cash? 
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:49:23
Got it. Thanks for the clarification. Fuck BCH

There are no Bcash website links. "BCH" is briefly mentioned in one sentence in the article if thats what you are referring to.

"In June of 2017, Jiravijit and 6 others convinced a Finnish man, Aarni Otava Saarimaa, to invest a sizeable chunk of cryptocurrency with them, under the assumption that the funds would be used to buy shares in companies that would offer him dividends. 
These "companies" supposedly invested in Dragon Coin, a cryptocurrency project which claims to pair blockchain technology with the entertainment industry.
Saarimaa made the investment and transferred 5,564 BTC ($24 million USD) to the suspects, but started to become suspicious when he was never invited to any shareholders' meetings. "

Despite news hitting the press that Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF application was denied by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there have been no changes with the proposed VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust ETF which has been popular in the news lately.
The release regarding the denied Bitcoin ETF was actually only related to an appeal from a two year old application by the Winklevoss twins, which had already been denied last year.

Did you read the article? The one that was denied was an appeal from a previously denied application from 2 years ago. The VanEck SolidX ETF has much better chance of being approved.

I just wondered if there was a reliable website for info on trading/altcoins really.

Like a bitbays arbitrage fund?
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:43:42
Are there any arbitrage funds you can recommend that might be safer?
