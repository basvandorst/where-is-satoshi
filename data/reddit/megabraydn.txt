You don't get it. If someone is hoarding 25% of bitcoins its as if they don't exist. The value of YOUR bitcoins will increase. Think about it really hard. As a deflationary currency you are a slave to no one but your own desires and needs.

I got scammed in two ways. one guy had like 200 possitive feed back so i thought it was safe. It turned out that It was a hacked account and since I didn't use an "approved" shipment method Paypal took my monies. The other guy reported to his band an fraudulent transaction and Paypal ended up taking that from me too.

Coins are generated at a steady rate. No matter how many people are mining
