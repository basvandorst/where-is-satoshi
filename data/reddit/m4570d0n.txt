Well that's not true at all. Even if you meant firmware or software, it's still not true.

Again, this is false. Some phone OEMs do no release the firmware source code and keep it proprietary, some gladly provide it. It varies from phone model to phone model and from OEM to OEM.

Is that the important part because it allows you to willfully ignore the sentences directly following the part you quoted?


How do you think Martha Stewart (and her broker at Merrill Lynch) got convicted for insider trading regarding ImClone Systems, Inc. (biopharma stock)? It wasn't because she was an employee, owner or insider at ImClone Systems.

This is true for gold, but not silver. [Over half of silver demand is industrial use (electronics, medicine, chemical catalysts, etc.)](

Insider trading does not require one to be an employee/owner of a company or affiliated with it in any way. It just requires that one has access to nonpublic information about a company and makes a financial gain using that information.

Hey, if they can tackle all those problems then I'm all for it. But even if SENS research were successful, dealing with global food production, depletion of natural resources (and not just energy, although that is an important one) and figuring out what to do about world population growth and reproduction are all massive issues that are far beyond the scope of that foundation.

It was his 4th felony conviction. That's why. LA law has a mandatory life sentence without parole for a 4th felony conviction of any offense. Granted, all 4 felonies were minor, nonviolent theft-related felonies and the sentence is grossly out of proportion to the offense. But it's not as though it was *just* because of shoplifting that jacket.

The executive branch has nothing to do with this. Mandatory minimum sentencing limits, or removes, the judge's ability to exercise judicial discretion. A judge in a criminal case does not have the authority to override mandatory minimum sentencing laws enacted by the legislative branch. Those laws would have to be challenged in a higher court, which is outside of the scope the initial criminal case.
If anyone had power, it was the prosecutors, who could have reduced the charge to a misdemeanor rather than pursuing the felony charge.
Also of note: He won his appeal back in 1997 and the life sentence was vacated, but then in 1998 the state supreme court agreed that it was excessive and out of proportion with the offense, but that that the state's 4-strikes law could only be overturned in rare instances and as such, reinstated his life sentence.
However, it sounds like LA passed a huge overhaul of the criminal justice system this year, so he might get his sentenced reduced:

You might find these an interesting read (note: this is specific to just the US):
Regarding the tax treatment of coins received from hard forks:
[How To Report Bitcoin Cash And Avoid IRS Trouble](
Regarding the tax treatment of exchanging BTC to altcoins or vice versa:
 
[Cryptocurrency Traders Risk IRS Trouble With Like-Kind Exchanges](
[How Cryptocurrency Investors Can Avert IRS Attack](
I would imagine the majority of cryptrocurrency investors/traders are not taking coin-to-coin trades into account or are not accounting for them properly in their tax returns. The lack of further guidance from the IRS after their [initial 2014 guidance]( leaves this particular area very ambiguous. It's not technically currently illegal to not pay taxes on coin-to-coin trades, but when the IRS inevitably provides guidance on this issue, they are not likely to allow coin-to-coin trades to be treated as like-kind exchanges and there will be many people that will be at risk of receiving the wrath of the IRS if they don't amend their prior tax returns and pay the tax man.

Yeah. As an investment vehicle, BTC is great. As a currency, this is essentially hyper*de*flation.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:27:24
In the US, ALL transactions are taxable events. If you bought BTC with USD, then bought ETH with BTC, then converted ETH to USDT, you would owe taxes on both the purchase of ETH and on the purchase of USDT, even though you haven't converted back to $USD cash at any point. The IRS treats it basically the same as equity (stocks) and for tax purposes you have to treat all coin-to-coin transactions as if you sold the coin you owned for cash and then used that cash to buy a different coin, even though you never actually converted to cash.
Also, even if you had converted to cash, the location of that cash (in your GDax account vs your bank account) is completely irrelevant.

I can't tell if you're serious or trolling. Even the judge that sentenced him said the mandatory sentence “is constitutionally excessive in that it is grossly out of proportion to the seriousness of the offense."
