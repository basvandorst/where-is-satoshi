Well no pool is going to find blocks as often as GHASH.IO, unless GHASH.IO is extremely unlucky.
But you will get a larger percentage of the blocks that you find, since you will be contributing a larger percentage of the hashing power.

Sad one is unable to join the discussion without signing the petition. 
For starters the top ranked comment talks about the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 that was repealed in 1960.

Just realized I had reposted the news about ice gaming seminar.
It's quite interesting that they have a part of their seminar dedicated to Bitcoin.
To me it shows that it's starting to be treated very seriously.

Is this not based on the amount of blocks submitted and therefore luck as well as pool speed.
From the looks of things and comparing the hashrate of GHASH.IO and btcguild they have been lucky in the last 24 hours.
BTCGuild has about 3.2 PH and GHASH at its highest 4.61, although according to blockchain it's 41% compared to 18% of network hashrate.
66 : 33 for blockchain's estimate.
59 : 41 looking at hash rates.

I think I just found my favorite comment.

I think the blind national team is a better all round idea, Although you are right the IPL match would be seen by more and get reasonable national coverage. 
But having said that you are just one logo on a shirt, hoping that the commentators comment on your sponsorship (not like to doge-car where the entire car is covered in doge) so it may be money wasted.
Sponsoring the blind cricket team is much more likely to get positive media coverage throughout the season and I suspect that the our crowd funding initiative is more likely to be talked about whenever it's broadcast.
Having said that I like both ideas :).

The reality of the situation is unless you have physical mining equipment connected to the GHASH.IO network you're not going to be able to effect the situation.
If I sell my GH/s on CEX.IO, they will not sell unless someone else buys them, hence it does not decrease the hash rate of GHASH.IO .
Although if you do have your private mining hardware connected to the GHASH.IO network I suggest you disconnect it.

Exactly, It's a strange mindset to blame a currency for your sons drug addiction. As far as I know the only real trading platform in Australia is CoinJar and they are quite responsible in requesting proof of identification etc.
With Australia's mining industry slowing down, the talk of closure of manufacturing and agricultural companies, certainly we should be supporting new tech startups not attempting to ban them.

They do have good merged mining, although for the time being it may be best go migrate your physical miners to another pool.
Alot of the P2PPool have no fees also no merged mining, but DVC, NMC and IXC is worth hardly anything, anyhow.

According to [this article]( front-chest sponsorship is $1.67m USD for an IPL team or 3,884 BTC.
Also IPL is broadcast live on [YouTube]( so we could all watch and support our sponsored team, It's kinda put-Doge-on-a-car money, when you consider it will cost 2 million to sponsor a season of a Doge car.

Thats true, But similarly for 55k could you put bitcoin on a shirt for a match, The article states that some of the teams have up to 6 free sponsorship slots they are struggling to fill.

Shouldn't have sold all my BTC for JB !
Writing was on the wall for a while, the increasing complexity of bitcoin mining and the simplistic complexity of Beiber's musical currency. 
As computing power increases, so does the simplicity of stringing 3 chords together and a few repetitive lyrics, the algorithm is quite simple on modern hardware.... 
I just worry we will see the same crash when butterfly labs finally ship a product.

Ah man, I did that when it was at 200, sold my bitcoins then brought them back a little higher.
Had 4.6 BTC, then was down to 4.1 :(
Did manage to make another .1 in the craze of today, so happy sitting on my 4.2 while I transfer more money to invest if the market ever has another little tantrum.

What are the future plans when it comes to scalability at Mt.Gox, clearly it was not foreseen that there would be such a large interest in BitCoin over the last month, so it's understandable that infrastructure has not been invested in.
Is this an investment you now plan to make?

Up voting, was just thinking of asking the same question, even PayPal would be nice IMHO, It is a complete pain moving money into bitcoin, and has cost me personally quite a bit in international money transfers.

Is it worth writing a letter to the Financial Ombudsman Service perhaps finding out if you have any rights in such a situation or at least to flag it as an issue?

Why, you can programmatically start up servers using EC2's API, you can measure the load on your existing infrastructure then expand automatically when it gets within a threshold.
IMHO its an ideal solution for managing odd peaks in load like this, as long as your application is programmed in so that it can scale in such a way.
It would be a terrible idea if you where manually starting and stopping/configuring servers, but if you automate the process, I can't see the issues.
