As soon as you see the transaction broadcast over the network, it's very likely the bitcoins will transfer. Each confirmation past that provides more security. Depending upon the level of security your transaction requires -- which will usually be a function of the size of the transaction -- you can accept it as finalized anywhere from "seeing it broadcast without a double-spend" (like gyft.com) to "100 confirmations" (slush's pool), or anywhere you desire. I'm fairly sure anything under $500 or so, and gyft has the right idea. That makes the transactions feel "instant". I can buy my card in the store, and have it show up in the app before I reach the register.

OK, another problem:
I hacked together some scripts, and registered some domains. Some for myself, some for work.
Now, I'd like to separate those, and transfer my personal domains to another account, and transfer my work domains to yet another account. How does one do this? Wait for the domains to expire, and re-register them using another wallet.dat?
Combine these issues with the lack of documentation, the reduction in processing power that is coming with pools leaving in droves, and the lack of active developer ... well, anything, and it becomes clear that NMC, despite my rooting for it, is on the way down.
This makes me sad, because I saw it as a way to democratize DNS without government intervention.

Buy an amazon.com gift card on gyft.com, use that to buy CAH. My deck should arrive Thursday by that exact method.

I would counter that we need both: spending to show that commerce is both possible and fair, and hoarding to encourage savings. Balance in all things, amirite?

Until merchants learn that bitcoin doesn't have reversals/chargebacks. Once word of that gets out, along with low fees, merchants will flock to it.

Thank you. I like it when my upvotes have weight, and this truly deserved it.
And let us hope that someday soon, all upvotes and karma are reflected with bitcoin rewards!
Now, I imagine that the future of those of us atheists with faith in bitcoin will someday use the phrase "keep the blockchain" as a suitable replacement for "keep the faith".

You know what? You're right. This is a place for serious discussion. (Though there's always room for dissent, amirite?)
Anyway, already exists, though drastically underused:

Agreed, but it was nice being able to gas up the car with btc...

Yeah, I'm not seeing a litecointip subreddit and user yet...

If namecoin can't get developers to catch up to the current bitcoin version, then the ASICs will never get to mine them. Everyone is losing interest quickly. 
I've not seen clear documentation on how coins get recycled, so once they are spent on a domain, are they gone fovever, or do miners get them back?
With the major pools dropping merged mining, what is our incentive to remain interested?
And I say this as someone who has namecoins and plenty of .bit domains.

And their OS is relevant in what way?
Oh, trolling. Yawn.

Nice job trying to put words in my mouth. Go away, troll.
