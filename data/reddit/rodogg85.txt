Yes, i said in my post i plan to wait until after the halving at least.
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:28:09
Im a little sick of seeing btc around 10k. Either drop to 6k or go to 16k already.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:50:47
The money invested into btc wont prevent from buying a home.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:18:28
this might be the dip. dipshit.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:32:24
Youre a fucking idiot
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:59:17
Maybe i shouldnt have stated the whole i wanna buy a house thing. I will still have money to get a house, but thats good to know.
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:53:52
Thanks for the advice. I wonder what good is to people to cash out when they lose 90% lol. Might as well continue holding knowing how up and btc is.

I bought from coinbase, but not sure its the fastest way. Also there might be some daily limit withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:00:37
I definitely can wait longer. Also im thinking too take out some in year and hold the rest.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:18:05
I said i bought in at the price of 10k per bitcoin, not one bitcoin :)

@_date: 2019-06-27 21:42:22
whats the next high?
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:45:25
Touche :)
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:59:05
Why are you telling people this story of your measly profit lol. Everyone has their own strategies of what to do with their bitcoin. You are amazing man you sell all and then buy when its lower, who cares?
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:52:56
I like the spirit!
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:47:36
Yea i am getting paranoid! Seems to me i would need to keep hiding everything on top of everything! I got the ledger nano for now and now i hear i need to write down the passphrases for backup, thats why im wondering where to put them.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:37:21
Toke up to that!
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:08:11
I remember those days :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:29:59
Just put all $300 on it now and enjoy the ride. Its a gamble. If you like what you get then cash out. If you wanna keep riding it, the skys the limit. Itll take some time but if you can just put all $300 on it and forget about and not need to have that money, then just let it sit. When you have more money to gamble then put more of it btc. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:56:32
Aint gonna pay for that lol
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:22:32
Serisouly why you give a shit?
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:12:20
i am in your shoes, and im holding because i dont need that profit. Im holding to get much more when its much more significant. If you need whatever profit you can get now then you are playing a different game with btc, one that will have alot of swings. Youre no expert my friend.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:47:56
Fuck you
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:51:48
I wouldnt sell all of it in a year
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:58:56
You cant understand something like bitcoin fully where it can crash and youll lose tons of money. Gambling.
