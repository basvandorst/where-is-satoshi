I guess? Anything is possible and I could be completely wrong and BTC becomes the new gold. But I'm just not convinced. Your scenario doesn't sound great either. I mean, everyone is on the wave now and that's great, but I think, long term, BTC isn't the crypto that sticks.

How is deflation good for the holder? Your money today is worth less than yesterday? Deflation is good for the debtor.

How bitcoin doesn't enter a deflationary spiral has also never been explained satisfactorily to me - unless they change bitcoin to not have a max amount, all these HODLers will be left with a valueless currency.

We're talking about two different things. Deflation in the economy means lower prices, but I'm referring to the deflation of a currency, Bitcoin in this case.

I suppose the way I see it is that BTC is only rare insomuch as there is only X BTC, but the pool of all cryptocurrency is boundless. The same can't be said for precious metals.

I mean...all the HODLing calls are a symptom of an eventual deflationary collapse. Bitcoin is a "currency" nobody actually wants to spend. If nobody spends it, it's not worth anything. The argument can be made that it's more like gold than money, but I don't really buy that.

Nobody wants to spend Bitcoin because its price is ever increasing. It's essentially a currency that you don't want to spend because in a year that $100 in BTC you used to buy something could be worth $1000. Take the case of the guy being pizza for 100 bitcoins or whatever. So, nobody is spending it and therefore it doesn't have any intrinsic value as a currency. Eventually, people catch on and start exchanging for $$. But who will want to buy in for a currency that isn't a currency? The price vs. $$ collapses with potentially no/few buyers. That's how I've understood it and the calls for HODLing make it seem like that is the case. Again, maybe BTC is more like gold, but that doesn't seem right to me either.

Forex is probably a terrible idea if you're trying to come up with rent money and, again, if it was easy everybody would be doing it. You might as well buy some Bitcoins and learn to play poker and join Seals with Clubs or something.

Thanks, man. This is a pretty incredible and selfless thing to do.

Sure, I may have signed up for reddit 10 days ago, but it'll take pure selfishness and free Bitcoins for me to make my first post here.
Oh yeah, happy cake day!
