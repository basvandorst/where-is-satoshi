Bitcoin will implode like the twin towers
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:18:15
There is nothing special about Bitcoin, other than the fact that it was the first cryptocurrency, ever. It's a slow and clunky 1st generation crypto. The real opportunity is in the Altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:41:26
You're not a real friend. Just tell him to go to  and instantly buy Bitcoin, like the rest of the FOMO sheep. Baaahhhh Baaahhhh
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:54:48
Bitcoin isn't scarce. It will be forked, again and again. You cannot use it as a currency. As for it being a store of value, that is a complete joke. It isn't even decentralized. There are a few gigantic mining operations that own all the hash rate power. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:12:34
Now watch the price trade sideways, or move down, while Altcoins skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:00:38
While you're waiting for BTC to hit 20k, I'm making 5,000% on my Alts, every single week. Good job, sheep!
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:18:46
For buying and selling, just use GDAX (coinbase's exchange). For transferring, you have no other choice, but to pay high fees, because the mempool is always backed up, due to massive influx of users combined with capped block size. If you want a better option, just choose one of the many altcoins on the market today; Bitcoin Cash is a pretty good option. Hope this helps!

I have to take a nasty diarrhea. This is great! Bitcoin is trash. Officially 223,000 unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:10:38
Bittrex and Binance are awesome
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:03:48
Congratulations for being years behind the curve! Altcoins are the future, NOT Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:29:37
Bitcoin is garbage. Anyone with half a brain can clearly see why it is no longer prized.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:45:57
Very dumb move! While you're waiting for it to "moon", I've already made $50,000 on Iota in the past 7 days. Bitcoin should be renamed "Dumbcoin". It's not even decentralized, it's owned by Chinese miners and blockstream. The day it's available at CME, it'll drop by 50%, Mark my words.

Bitcoin is for butt monkeys
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:10:38
I have TONS of Bitcoin.. Bitcoin Cash. I got in BTC at 2k and out at 14k
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:19
HAHAHAHAHA! You got that wrong, buddy. The GIANT GREEN WALL = ORDERS
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:29:16
She's got the right idea. I'd suggest NOT investing in Bitcoin, but rather investing in a portfolio of extremely undervalued, amazing Altcoins. All you have to do is compare the weekly growth of Bitcoin to a handful of Altcoins in order to see where the real opportunity is.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:43
Bitcoin is for people who read 2 minutes of a $1,000,000 price prediction article, and then decide to buy. Gold is valuable because it has utility, Bitcoin does not. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:15:03
It's because Bitcoin is for uneducated losers that do not understand economics
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:01:41
Sell your Bitcoins. All the sheep holding it are watching the price trade sideways or down, while every Altcoin is skyrocketing to the moon like a virgin dick on wedding night.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:45
Cash out your Bitcoin while you still can!!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:31:43
Mining isn't profitable anymore.. Is that why there are multi million dollar mining operations all over the globe with more popping up everyday?
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:46:14
Haha, as soon as it dips, you'll be asking "should I sell?". While you BTC "hodlers" are waiting to "moon", I've made 500% on Iota. By the time BTC hits 20k (if it even makes it that far), I'll have made 10,000% ROI via various, superior Altcoins. Don't be a foolish FOMO sheep!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:35:01
Don't invest, period. Gold is valuable, because it has utility, BTC does not. There are currently 215,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. If you sell a car today for $10,000 worth of BTC, you'll receive it next week only to find that it's now worth $8,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:37:26
Bitcoin Cash
Power Ledger
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:30:24
Yes. You're ok with her investing in Bitcoin, which has transactions times ranging from hours to days? I'm not sure if you're aware or not, but when your transaction sits in the mempool, it is vulnerable to thieves. The "store of value" argument for Bitcoin is absolute rubbish. Any coin can be used as a store of value. The Bitcoin market cap could easily be wiped out within a few hours. I watched it almost happen a few weeks ago when Bitcoin cash went on a run. The day that Bitcoin takes a permanent nosedive, even the most hardcore Bitcoin fans will cut their losses and sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:30:29
Bitcoin is for losers. HAHAHAHA 
Stupid bag holders!!
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:25:53
143224 Unconfirmed Transactions Live updating list of new bitcoin transactions
This is the reason why. Your Bitcoin is vulnerable to thieves when it sits for that long in the mempool. You have your hard earned capital tied up in an extremely overvalued piece of junk
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:24:23
I do
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:46:11
$150 over 8-10 months? You must be joking. I cannot continue this conversation with you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:54
I don't feel sorry for any of them. Diving into something without conducting the proper due diligence deserves punishment.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:13:15
It will NOT hit $1,000,000.. $100,000.. or even $10,000. It'll drop to $2,000 and disappear like a little piece of crud 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:00:22
Look - I have always loved Bitcoin, but the fact of the matter is that there are many other coins, that are more useful, at a much more affordable price. If Bitcoin didn't have competition, it would certainly rise to those levels, but it does have competition.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:57:15
Quite the contrary. My shit coins are producing tremendous returns.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:28:08
Not a chance. You'll be munching on your relatives dry, disgusting turkey/stuffing, constantly checking your phone, wondering why the price is tanking to $4,500.

How large was the transaction, 0.0000123?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:16:02
News flash, it's never going to reach $10,000
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:54:11
I like cryptocurrency and I like to make money, but why invest $9,000 in a clunky elephant, when there are a myriad of much better options on the market, which yield much better returns?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:08:50
face the music.. it's a junk bond
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:03:03
Segwit2x fork failed. The average bitcoin holder has no idea how to transfer their coin from legacy to Segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:52:21
Coinbase is not a wallet. It's a centralized exchange that is holding something that is supposed to be decentralized.
