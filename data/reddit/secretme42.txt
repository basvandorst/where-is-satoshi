We will see over 10k this year - and quite possibly very soon.
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:23:27
Use bitstamp for buying - very safe and trustworthy imo. They support sepa payments and withdrawals.
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:29:16
well hi there my fellow trading buddy :). How the descent going. I've still got my eyes on 10k, THIS YEAR. What's your position at the moment - hopefully not one of those about to get rekt bears.
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:58:03
I think I may have been wrong with 9.2 - it might actually be closer to 9k next week - but lets see. Are you still on for 6.5-6.6k?
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:37:15
One thing to look at is previous performance when approaching a previous ATH after having a significant correction. If we assume we will approach 20k, which I believe we will based on a number of factors, then we should continue higher than 20k before any major pullback or correction. How much higher is difficult to say, but it should be just the first leg of getting to 65k.
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:11:22
I reckon 8.5 give or take a few % then up again
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:24:25
We’ll see. We’ll definitely be higher than here within the next 48 hours.
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:08:47
Yeah - I agree with 12k being the target in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:46:19
Nope. Next sell target is around 9.2 - probably next week. See you at 9.2 ish next week:)
@_date: 2018-05-06 05:52:07
I don’t think so
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:22:33
Whilst I am expecting another dip down to the 6’s, possibly a double bottom to 6k, I’m not expecting it to go much lower. I’m also not expecting those prices for a number of weeks at the minimum - possibly even Q3. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 05:13:24
Lol - we’ll all my indicators are showing doom and gloom incoming. But I wasn’t far off in my initial prediction of 9k for a short term move. For the next target down - I think possibly 5s maybe - being realistic - whilst I would love it to reach the targets you say - and I’m now not ruling them out - again being realistic - I don’t think 2.5k is probable for at least 4 to 6 months. But anything is possible. I think the lowest we’ll see as a capitulation price this time round is more likely down to 4’s, but I think that is probably unlikely. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:07:30
You want to be looking at Log base 2. Look at tops and bottoms on Log 2 for the full history of BTC. And yes - we will have another dip somewhere in 3rd quarter, possibly double dip down to 6k levels, but we should get a new ATH this year. After that, first target somewhere in 2019 / 2020 should be around 65k. When comparing this correction against April 2013 and Early 2014, the fact that the recent low was higher than the low in Feburary is a major indicator that Feb was bottom. In 2014 correction, each low was lower than the last. This also has a significant effect on momentum indicators which is what drives BTC and every alt. It's the same momentum indicators that result in a parabolic occurring - and yes - there should be another parabolic on BTC in about 3 and a bit years.Not convinced we'll get one sooner, but it's possible - too early to tell at this stage, but not impossible we see another one. When all momentum indicators go positive - that's when the fun begins :)
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:47:47
I maybe increasing my target to 9.5 - but it might not get there for a while - but will decide on IF breaking 9k occurs.
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:40:25
Does this move follow your target of 6.5 - 6.6? TBH, I do see a possible double bottom occurring - but not yet. Not for many weeks. If I had to predict - it would be higher than 6.5, but, I'm not ruling out a 6k double bottom later in the year. But based on my indicators - I'm pretty sure we aren't going lower, or at least much lower in the event of a flash crash. And I also predict that we will see a new ATH this year.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:23:44
All this talk of the fomo crew - but has anyone heard of the panic crew when we break below 6k. It is as much of a possibility as going to 10k. And there are many indicators that strongly suggest that’s where we’re heading this month.
@_date: 2018-06-02 13:52:32
VPN could sort that :) Although it won't happen. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:15:06
Well I wasn’t sure tbh - but I was seeing his move come up which is why I didn’t go long. I was short at from 7.6 so quite happy. I think we still have the potential for 5’s coming. My long term indicators definitely suggest that’s the case.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:01:35
Lol - happy trading to you too man. Not ruling out 2.5 - but that is sometime away - at least some months away if not next year if we get there. I’m not playing longs at the moment - just shorting at the right moments - so far so good . Volatility is perfect for it. Don’t think I’ll be looking at any longs for a few weeks. I think we’ve got a bigger drop to come than what we saw at the weekend - possibly later this week.
@_date: 2018-06-01 08:25:28
IMO - Bitstamp is the most trustworthy. I had funds there when they were hacked - and it was nerve racking whilst they were offline. But they came back and took the loss themselves unlike some other exchanges who gave either disappeared altogether or passed on the loss to their customers. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:02:50
Pmsl. Yes. No - I have some very good indicators so know we are going lower. Just as we have done. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:32:29
Banks aren't paid to keep customers money safe. Banks are there to make a profit at anyone's expense. They're just as dodgy as crypto scam artists - except they're endorsed by governments to do so. You are obviously very young other wise you would remember the financial crisis 10 years ago. And if you are old enough to remember it, you should do a bit of research into what caused it as I assume based on your statement you have no idea.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:00:11
Me too. Possibly 8.5 in July - depends on how low we go in June. Hope he’s making good use of his dick before 2020.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:07:10
And possibly lower than 5.5 - I think we’ve got a bigger drop coming later this week than the one we just had at the weekend.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:14:21
Rekt - we are going lower.
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:06:55
OK - you're well within you're right to not want anything to do with bitcoin. But at least put up some valid arguments. ISPs - VPN. Although I can't see why any country other than communist states would or could ban bitcoin. 
Do you not remember the statements of the internet will never come to anything.
Not sure being able to print more money is a good thing - look at history - it just devalues that currency.
You also seem to forget the impact of the centralized corrupt banks who only just 10 years ago, screwed the world economy up.
In terms of usage, I remember as a kid, more things were bought with either cash or cheques. Then came along cash machines, and then came along debit and credit cards. And then not too recently chip and pin. But I very rarely see anyone using a cheque book any more.
You need to open your eyes instead of being a closed minded sheep who does what he's told to do and think. If you really believe, that banks don't get hacked they do. If you don't think banks haven't gone bankrupt, or bailed out by their governments - they have. Visa needs infrastructure as much as bitcoin - that can be hacked too.
Here in the UK, the TSB bank had some major IT problems, during which people's bank accounts were emptied, loans taken out and all sorts of dodgy goings on. 
To try to ignorantly claim, that bitcoin is susceptible to all the problems you mention, and the systems we currently have aren't - you are one ignorant dude, and I am grateful that there are people in this world who have a better vision for the future, than the BS we have now.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:37:16
Agreed- happened already. Most it’ll pullback to is maybe 7.5, but I see 12k in Jan or Feb. Then back down to around 7.5 to 8 in maybe  March.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:44:05
So it would seem. Not sure on 2020 - but anything is possible. But you’re right right about the 6k potentially becoming super resistance. If we now stay below that for sometime - I’d expect a move above there to be quite dramatic. But that could now be sometime away. Not sure on 2.5 either - I’m eyeing 3k as a possible bottom, or somewhere around there. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:44:05
If you look, most coins have had major pumps this year, even those with no news at all that have been around for 3-4 years or more.
The majority of alts declined for the last 2 years against btc, hitting a significant bottom, resulting in them all following the same trend. But the pumps were staggered for maximum profit. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:43:35
Cause in 6 months or less, 10000 will most likely be less than the global average. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 07:56:47
