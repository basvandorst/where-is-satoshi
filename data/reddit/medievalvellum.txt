That is totally true.

... why is the webcam going to record who is making the purchase? Is that vital information for a vending machine? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 16:51:09
Or, you know, you could contribute to the bitcoin economy by using them, and using bitcoin in general, as your primary means of purchasing things (at least online).

The problem isn't quantitative easing, is it? It's the way it's being done. Put that money into the hands of the working class by raising and temporarily subsidizing the minimum wage and it might have more of an effect.

is darkwallet still in alpha?
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:14:39
that is... actually a pretty good idea.

@_date: 2014-12-05 11:14:25
Deposit insurance yeah, but what I'm talking about is like, if you rent a car with a Mastercard or whatever, you get insurance coverage. That kind of thing. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 14:37:14
...maybe a dark wallet. :/

I'm not saying you're wrong -- the ITER project is a bureaucratic nightmare that's slowing the pace of scientific advancement by years. But I don't think that means a P11B is any easier than a DT tokamak to design and build.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:14:18
So, so misguided.
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:11:04
Yeah I think you're right. Here he is using the fact that the bitcoin foundation doesn't have strong enough corporate management as a justifying factor for his prediction. I mean really. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:19:07
[Like this?](
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:23:20

Not at all. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:34:08
I respectfully disagree. From your point of view it's about time and effort. From mine it's about ability. If someone is writing casually or not is immaterial if they can't see with any reliability when you need to use "the" or "a" or when to pluralize or not. The "I've" and "there's" further inducate that whoever wrote the one on the right was already writing casually.  Though I do agree that if he had someone to help him write the one on the right then he could have been involved. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:26:11
I think the LFTR is more feasible, given that we can't get DT fusion to work and P11B is several orders of magnitude more challenging. 
I feel like one day we're going to harness fusion for power generation, and it's going to be incredibly complex, a monumental work of engineering. It's going to be a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. And then aliens are going to visit, and look at it, and applaud politely before asking what the point was, given that we're bombarded by enough solar radiation to power human energy expenditure 20,000 times over. And that's not even including geothermal or tidal energy. But I think they'll be impressed.

[This article](  starts to get at it. The thing is, she saw poverty as a gift from God, and so despite her vast resources, did little to actually ameliorate the situation, instead essentially nurturing and maintaining the poverty itself. Chris Hitchens wrote about her a lot, I'm told, but I haven't read his writing on her.

Dude I told you to stop following me around with that camera. And put some pants on.

..derp. Yeah, sorry. On the other hand I do think these guys will deliver. They were supposed to ship mid-February though, and they are (obviously) late. The review models have been sent out though, so they're definitely still coming.
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:41:33
I'm pretty impressed with them. Managed to keep themselves clear of most of the 2008/9 crisis (probably because they were following the Basel accords because in Canada people were actually paying attention). As far as financial institutions go, I can't really complain. And that's saying something.

is uBTC the same as μBTC?

You never know with Putin. He could totally give Alaska a cutesy pun nickname and then try to annex it.

Nope! It was as easy as bitcoin can be :) Looking forward to my mead!

This right here is one of the most peculiar pieces of evidence that laws break down or otherwise malfunction near the top. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:23:27
Yeah... but Bitcoin is more like cash. I guess I just don't see the need.
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:05:47
Or, now, the 28K sell wall at 320.

Canadian living in the US here. No. Seriously, they don't. 
Edit: speaking of the average American, not the tech-savvy bitcoin users. They probably do.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:29:37
Oh I interpreted it differently. I thought he was giving them the finger because he paid them. Because that's kind-of how I feel when paying taxes. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:10:24


Now if only we could convince Putin of the same, so he stops eyeing the north so suspiciously. Knowing him he'd just say all the people in the north speak Russian and it's their right to hold a referendum to join Russia...
@_date: 2014-12-24 03:45:39
Erf... yeah I guess until it gets reclassified as currency.

To be fair, a lot of credit cards come with built-in insurance and fraud protection, which you don't get with bitcoin (or, for that matter, with cash). I just don't think credit cards are the ones who should feel most threatened by bitcoin -- more like banks and western union.
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:38:16
Yep. We really. *Really.* Love our fairy tales.
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:52:20
...it's not an ATM. It's a vending machine that takes bitcoin. As far as I'm aware, nobody takes my picture when I buy a bag of doritos.

Came to say this exactly. Ever since they initiated photo check deposits, I haven't actually... been to my bank. I mean they have evening hours (because for a bank they're pretty good) but... I mean I needed a certified check once. I guess I'd have to go in for another.
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:21:04
I mean don't get me wrong. I'm actually happy to make enough to have to pay taxes on it. But nobody *likes* to give up their money, especially when they don't feel like they have enough (like many, I don't have a retirement plan, for example) even if they recognize it's for the common good.
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:58:26
Yeah, and the defense of that is that since they're not privy to voting or election, they can't be swayed by the electioneering that goes on in the house. But the same could be done with eight-year, non-renewable terms (i.e. you can be elected to be a senator, for eight years, but have to do something else after that).
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:06:59


Not that they're right to have done so, but it is amusing that your name is SexWithAGoat. It makes me wonder what people could call you that would offend you, is all.

BitStamp is back to normal though, looks like, and MtGox never really stopped running normally (I mean, normally for MtGox. Busted busted busted for anyone else). Looks like MtGox wants someone else to fix their expensive programming mistakes for them (they keep asking for a malleability fix in the protocol but as BitStamp just showed it doesn't look necessary). You probably knew all this. Why did I just type this out? 
As you were. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:14:06
Yeah, you could, but let's face it: Facebook doesn't give a rat's ass about facts. For instance, the facebook community [Jewish Ritual Murder]( has been reported hundreds of times as in violation of Facebook's own anti-discrimination policy, but there it is, still "not in violation."
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:54:05

@_date: 2014-04-16 14:02:32
Yeah, maybe you're right?

I don't think there's a limit on it for TD, but there's probably a limit on how much of it you can spend right away. I haven't checked that.

Or Hulu Plus -- then they'd have the better user interface *and* the better payment option.

First: Happy Cake Day!
Second: I disagree -- regardless of the tenor of the communication, the e-mail on the left shows several key signs of ELL mistakes that would be a real challenge to fix in a professional context in English. The only way they're by the same person is if the one on the right was edited by a fluent speaker (which it might have been: the use of "we" suggests that S. Nakamoto is not the only one working on it).
Differences: D. Nakamoto's e-mail shows problems with when and where to use definite and indefinite articles, pluralization issues (including when and how to use an apostrophe), and spelling issues (recident?). S. Nakamoto's paper shows extreme comfort with abbreviations and relaxed tone (I've, that's), consistent proper use of the definite and indefinite articles, pluralization, and apostrophe use.

@_date: 2015-01-13 00:08:53
This boggles the mind. He's telling you he's going to make it illegal to encrypt your e-mail so nobody else can read it? There has to be something unconstitutional about that.

So [this is what I was talking about]( The idea is that rather than a single binding document, it's a body of laws and precedent that build up over time to create an "uncodified" constitution.

Don't you have an unwritten constitution? 
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:03:16
I mean, yes, ironic, but also just totally blind to the problem. It's like they're ignoring the spirit of the rule in favor of the letter. This is like the US saying individual political donations can't be more than 1000, but super-PACs are totally fine. Someone's missed the point. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:34:43
That's how I see it -- a plan B. If Core implements a larger block size when this stuff finally comes to a head, nobody will feel the need to switch to XT and the whole thing will just continue on. XT is just an emergency button in case the Core devs put off the size increase too long.

Except it's not a Nascar race; it's a cross-country train journey. The engineers running the train are doing a great job, but they're having an argument with the track builders over where the tracks should go. Now one group has built tracks way off in the distance, and people who were worried that the tracks seemed to be ending while everyone was talking about it are happy. It doesn't mean the other group wouldn't (or won't) build other tracks, but there are plenty of people relieved because in their view at least there are tracks as far as they can see. They just might not go where everyone wants.

Technically, yes, but I wouldn't expect the losing blockchain to survive for long. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:06:10
Ah well, there's always r/bitcoinxt ...sigh
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:02:16
Coming soon: you don't talk about the first rule of r/bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:34:14
Exactly -- if the deal was canceled in October 2012, then the money owed back to him should be what the Bitcoins were worth at that point. I think the original judge made the right call. Although given that the guy's had his money since then, if it were me I'd want interest for the loan I'd inadvertently given the dirtbag.

Well it depends on how much, to whom, and what your economy looks like at the time. In times of plenty, say in Canada in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a balanced budget with a surplus meant some of the country's loans could be paid off. This meant that in the future less interest payments would be made, allowing budgets to be smaller. Realistically, they didn't shrink it enough to have a measurable impact, but it gave creditors the impression that Canada was a good investment, and definitely played well with the voters. 
But you don't always want to pay off debt, you're right. You do want to continue to pay the interest on your debt though, otherwise nobody will lend you any more money. And you really should not borrow more than a certain percentage of your country's earning potential either. It's quite the game they play, isn't it?

You mean the old labour or the center-right Blair labour?

See: "Wall Street" for more information. 
I mean don't get me wrong, there's a place for day trading, and I'm bummed when a day trade (I deal in very small amounts) goes south, but I never put out there more than I'm happy to lose. Not okay with, happy. 
But I think Bitcoin is going to be something really significant within the middle-term. Otherwise I wouldn't even bother.

Yeah, I mean honestly, people don't really like paying for things they can have for free in anonymous situations... though, you know, if you want to leave *me* a tip in bitcoins [on my blog]( you totally can. :D
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:48:09
That... Is utter bullshit. When's the next election and why are these fascists still in power?
