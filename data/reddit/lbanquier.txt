Do you love yourself that much ?
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:29:58
I wish i could understand the problem too

Why the rooting algo is so important to you ? I don't understand the problem
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:24:34
I'm in the same situation ... I've already started ... Making a $30 test on all wallets ... seeds storage ... 
Now i m on Kraken with my $$$ waiting to the good time to put it all and wait for 10years.
IDK when to buy btw
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:42:06
I use kraken

Thx for your answer stupidx, my f***ing 500bucks printer works only with wifi, guess i ll draw the QR-Code by myself :D
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:26:26
May i ask you how you reproduce the QR-code (private key) from the PC offline to a paper sheet ? Do you just type directly the private key instead of the QR Code ?
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:30:02
Best advice you can give to someone, thx.

1 PART 1 vote ... majority decide

Hi, i can't predict what the community will consider "legal" or not on the Marketplace... We assume that low level drugs will be considered legal since lot of countries are considering it legal.
To see the PART ownership : 
TOP 100 owns more than 50% of the network but you have to know that the 1rst adress (900k PART is own by the foundation and will not be used to vote)
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:37:26
I understand your position but i still think you are judging too quickly. I appreciate the fact that you are giving fair arguments even if the majority is because you simply "don't know". You don't know what it feels to be a vendor on Amazon, you don't know how the Particl Blockchain was created (POS inherited of a multi-year POW blockchain) and you don't know how Particl is handling privacy. All this proves that it will take times to open people minds about decentralized e-commerce and we are really far from (like you just wrote) getting real adoption.

E-commerce is too centralized (Amazon, ebay, Alibaba...). We need to be able to use our Bitcoin to buy merchandises privatly. Satoshi was the first to have this idea of decentralized e-commerce developped on top of bitcoin. I really hope to see this real one day

Did you store your reminder phrase on Internet ?
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:09:33
Gettin' insulted and mocked, you can't imagine how sad i am right now. We are all in the same fuc***ing boat and if we don't go in the same direction we are doomed.

Hello good sir, i confirm that $3 is a high fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:30:16
What kind of PC are you looking for ?

When is 0.18.0 bitcoin core going mainnet ?

Crypto agnostic (you can pay/receive what you want).
Marketplace opens q1 2018. Lot of probability mid feb

What you are asking for an evolution on kraken is actually a whole divergence inside the bitcoin protocol. You can't move 1 bitcoin from an adress without the private key ... It's the only thing that make bitcoin safe. 
I agree with you it's very inconvenient for the guy who made the mistake, but what do you think will happen if kraken loses millions of $ his users has deposited just to give one guy his 0.5 XBT back ?
I know it's hard to hear but the truth is, kraken is a safe place and i hope they will keep their security procedure.

how to never get married : 
1/ stop loss are for newbies
2/ leverage is so fun
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:54:26
Man you have to find an escrow ... Atleast Particl Marketplace will answer to all your problem the next time ;)
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:43:47
This kind of mistake happens frequently, you can consider your 0.5 XBT lost because Kraken won't compromise their private key (thx god) for one individual.
There is a lot of post of this subject on reddit and the support have given quite good answers. I'm really sorry for your loss.

Do you forgot that 2 pizzas you sold back in the days ?
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:52:13
I always do a first minimal amount transaction to avoid this kind of adress mistake then the full package.
