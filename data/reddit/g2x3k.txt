if it damages your hardware you shuld ask for a refund any hw shuld be able to take 100% load ... or its like selling a fast car and saying it can drive close to 350 km/ph but is you drive pass 150 km/ph the wheels will fly off and you will get clutch and parts of gearbox in your face....

fbi could make a bitstamp account and start dumping the big wallet ? id like to see anyone buy that,
but ye all with bitcoins can go there make an account so questoin is not whats largest there ... the twins could start dump cause predicting price will lay lower next ½ year from here ... and needed bit cash for something funny now
alot "without" names that has quite big portions aswell
even with 700k$ thats a move with risks theres alot that could just fill it and he would end up lowering price cause he tempts the big sellers  that see can actually sell at this price now
