Not true, most are completely oblivious.  Hell I was in a conversation with an expat the other day who had no idea he was even supposed to be filing taxes for the last 12yrs.  The FATCA discussion almost made him faint.  I would say of the millions of expats maybe 30% know about it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:53:00
Regardless of compliance you are still required to file and I have joint accounts with a foreign spouse and a 50% stake in a self employed business which adds other complexity.  I gave up and relinquished my US citizenship, so don't -really- care anymore.  1,000's are now dumping their passports, not tax evaders just plain ole minnows who can't take the fear anymore.  Not to mention the expense and time taken to be compliant, it's ridiculous.  As I said, no other country treats their expats like this.  The benefit of the US passport is no longer valid for most expats.

I didn't owe any taxes but still had to file, and living check to check it is not easy to afford an international accountant to file taxes in the US.  Meanwhile my friends here in NZ, foreigners  from all over the world do not worry about taxes at all other than NZ.  Citizenship based taxation is a joke.. and to think once the US rose up against taxation without representation.  bah.

The wiki link above does an ok job.  My biggest beef with it it total invasion of privacy.  My foreign bank would give over all banking info to the IRS including my foreign partner's info!

I tend to view exchanges as casinos.  I've been using bitcoin for a while and have never used an exchange.  So it seems the majority of exchange users are using them as casinos and playing the market.  It's like going to a casino called "Gox" in vegas, winning several 1,000 in chips, then coming back the following day to play more, maybe cash in but they've gone out of business.  I'm sure my post will not be popular, but those freaking out the most probably should have known the insane risk they were taking in the first place.

My old man emailed me today saying bitcoin is about to be outlawed and to get out now.  I take it this is because a senator called for banning it.  I knew the MSM dumbs down the general population, but until I got into bitcoin I had no idea just how much.

Keep in mind it's been known for sometime these numbers are altered and do NOT show all renunciations (google can help explain this). Many believe it to be 10x higher or more.

When you renounce you must still prove to the IRS you are compliant in tax for the last 6 years.  You can't just renounce and walk away.  See you are not a human being with any free will, the USA owns it's citizens even if they reject that nationality.  If you renounce and don't prove compliance with the IRS they'll use their many laws to come after you and yours.  Seig Heil!

I am not a tax evader.  I live overseas and am married and settled here.  I probably make around 30k a year.  I can't even afford an expat tax specialist to even file US taxes.  Myself and those like me number 6 million+.  These greedy people you refer to are a small handful and only account for around $40 billion iirc, most are US multi-national corps!  You think it is fair to have citizen based taxation of lower class who made a life overseas?  International Banks and businesses will now stop dealing with "US Persons".  That alone will lose more money than FATCA could ever take in.  Ignorance like yours nearly makes me want to burst a blood vessel in my brain.  US and Eritrea are the only 2 countries in the world with CBT, it's ludicrous and it's taxation without representation.  Why not give expats a form to fill out?  "If you want services of the US sign here and state you will remain in the tax system", "If you do not want services of the US sign here, turn in your passport".  Suppose you lived in California most of your life, then moved to New York.  Then were told "wait a second buddy, we consider you a California resident so you need to pay your California taxes as well.  If you do not you will be subject to stiff fines and penalties and barred from entering California.  We will not have you greedy tax cheats moving out of state and avoiding our taxes".  Pffft, wake up.

@_date: 2014-01-06 01:13:46
I should also mention "FBAR" reporting.  Any american overseas that has more than 10k in any account must file forms declaring it (even joint accounts with a foreign spouse).  If you don't file FBARs you can be fined 100,000's as well, even if you have a net worth nowhere near the fines.  So will expats continue having their privacy invaded overseas or simply take all monies that go over +10k and place them in Bitcoin?  I'm no longer American but if I were I would put as much as I could in Bitcoin just to spite the IRS gestapo.
