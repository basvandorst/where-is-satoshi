Its ok if you make the right moves. I turned a .07 into a .17 in 2 months and at this point I'm just letting these alts ride.  I'm in like 8 different coins

i would never spend my btc. its going up in value so anything i buy i will "lose" money on. no thanks rather sell at 50k or 100k
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:59:10
You think btc will only go up 5%??
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:35:50
My dad is showing interest in BTC, is now a bad time to advise him to buy 1 whole coin?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:15:39
He bought 1k for now. Will buy more each week
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:51:53
Hes more than ok i would just feel awful if the bubble popped and he lost 75% of the investment. I guess that's just part of the game
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:05:39
You just wasted money
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:29:43
Just pissed my greedy ass didn't sell yesterday when i knew i should have
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:49:41
I wouldn't care because the amount id have would change my life so much
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:26:11
Hes better off taking the min out needed for down payment and then just paying his mortgage. That way as BTC goes to the moon he won't have wasted it all and spent a hyper inflated amount on the house

Nexon loves cash. Used to play their games

Reminds me of my 12 and 13 year old self. Riding my bike to 7-11 everytime i saved up 10 bucks to buy more NX cash cards for Maplestory. The items helped too like the pets picked up your items

Good luck buddy! Happy treasure hunting!
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:51:26
Did this too. Sell if you have a half a brain
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:15:17
In your face to all that sold last night
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:44:30
24 and have a small amount but buying more each week
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:26:50
Good news for some like me waiting to buy. Hoping it keeps dropping so i can afford an entire coin
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:32:54
Good old 4chan 
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:36:02
