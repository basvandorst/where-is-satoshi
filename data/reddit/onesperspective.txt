Not sure how much it changes your argument but technically it’s considered dis-inflationary. The supply doesn’t inherently decrease (outside of possible loss from circulation), rather the inflation rate just decreases over time.

Never invest more than you’re willing to lose. Since you’re willing to lose everything, then fuck yea put it in crypto. That’s a no brainier. Scared money don’t make money. You stand to gain a lot in the upcoming years if you believe in the tech, which i believe everyone should

Powerful, yes. However i think it’s even more powerful when we can move $0.01 online. Micro transactions are where the real power is.

Personally I don't see the benefit of the paper portion and latter counting. If anything perhaps it could be where each individual registered gets access to a private key with one voting token, whereby they then send it to address X(candidate 1) or address Y(candidate 2) and simply let the ledger count and show which candidate got what amount of votes.

I would argue that it's not so much Bitcoin per se, rather digital currency in general that is going to massively take off

The amount has to increase over time to be inflationary, ie supply growth. I believe the amount has to decrease over time from its peak to be considered deflationary, ie supply shrinkage. 
Bitcoins supply isn’t decreasing, rather increasing over time but at a decreasing *rate*, thus i believe it should be seen as *dis*inflationary

I believe a more accurate term is *dis*inflationary

It’s a necessary step to get to where you’re talking about. It’s like the scaffolding of a building during construction. Its never meant to be part of the building. It’s a means to an end.

Yes. Though i would assume “better” in their context means better in *more ways*
