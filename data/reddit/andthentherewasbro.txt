My comment obviously assumes that scalability is invented, as Bitcoin will otherwise go to shit.
If billions send transactions, then due to low barriers of entry you'd expect more miners so fees would be consistently low.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:04:43
You seem like a lovely fella
@_date: 2016-08-27 21:17:12
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:06:25
That doesn't amount to 20%
@_date: 2016-08-27 18:51:49
To be honest because it doesn't. That is not thw benefit of bitcoin. Bitcoin gives rise to the possibility of sending money extremely cheaply without an intermediary.
@_date: 2016-08-30 20:32:10
Oh god this is so freaking corny, please look up the concept of externalities if you just want at least one reason why government exists.
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:21:42
Yeah and the point is why not measure it in 2 ounces in that case bitcoin is behind or measure it in half ounces then bitcoin is worth twice as much. Point is that its arbitrary and has no influence.
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:05:52
This literally does not make sense, the market cap is the only real value indicator not the price of the individual coin. Especially because it is compared with a completely arbitrary amount of gold. By this metric Bitcoin is worth nine times more than Apple...
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:36:16
Yeah you can compare them for price changes. But saying one is worth more than the other is meaningless, as in 100% useless information.
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:23:22
What weight you chose to denominate gold in is arbitrary. It might as well be grams or kilos. Compare them on market cap or changes that is literally the only valid point
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:33:30
No it is not. We can denominate gold differently and then Bitcoin either constantly exceeds its value or will never exceed the value. This is just nonsense.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:25:02
Okay great for you that you have worked in the financial sector for 20 years, that does not change the fact that the price of gold is arbitrary number. By this logic whenever a company does a stock-split the psychological impact on the investors is that they lost 50% of the market cap. We can denominate gold differently, and then whenever Bitcoin rises it exceeds the value of gold.
This is head and shoulders patterns in trading all over again.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:35:45
Wrong. Comparing apples and orange is just comparing Bitcoin and gold, not their price. Saying WOW apples just exceeded the price of 1/3 an Orange, this is huge news, is basically what this post is.
On top of this, these are currencies, meaning one Bitcoin usage is only to be traded, an apple is a good that can be eaten, making this comparison even more absurd.
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:59:38
I dont get it, why not make the block size adjustable?
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:35:58
Absolute valid concern, I will remember that. Really good point actually.
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:37:27
Yeah, but the alternative is btc dies out.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:41:49
Yeah exactly, so mining will be unprofitable quickly this leads to centralisation and fewer miners leading to worse security. Unlimited block size is bad
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:29:09
Disregarding the propagation issue, which I admittedly did not think about and definitely is a concern, fees will be driven down automatically.
If I can take the entire market, at a slightly lower price then I will do so. My competitor will do the same until we end up at essentially the variable cost, which is virtually zero, besides the propagation.
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:00:52
Which is exactly why the size should be adjustable. So it is not infinite
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:35:26
Besides the orphaned which is a concern, none of the others are significant costs in anyway to an individual miner when considering whether to include transactions or not, if you are increasing the blocksize from 1mb to 10mb.
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:37:33
Dude he has literally said those things?
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:37:13
? Please elaborate
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:38:53
CPU and RAM are to create the block, the amount of transactions in it doesn't really affect this. Orphaning is a very valid concern, disk space is also an excessively small cost on an individual level.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:00:48
Not adjusting the block means that as scale increases this problem will persist. As I am obviously missing something, please tell me why.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:01:40
Unlimited blocksize drives fees down to such a point that they earn no money.
@_date: 2017-01-26 13:36:18
I don't think its a stretch to say Breibarts journalistic integrity is pathetic.
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:01:12
Yeah, if that keeps going btc will be useless
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:37:52
They will set one that maximises profit, which is econ 101. The most basic result is that price will reach such a point where they are equal to costs. However here there are no variable costs. Thus accepting lower fees than another miner costs you nothing but gains thr entire market. Thus fees tends to zero.
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:39:55
Please elaborate besides the risk of orphaning.
@_date: 2017-01-15 10:03:53
You linked a story regarding CIA being untrustworthy and then something from wikileaks thats it. Hardly overwhelming facts
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:07:36
Its the only way to fix all the problems.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:35:54
The difficulty is dynamically adjusted, implement the same for size
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:36:34
Or because the sole thing he has been rock steady on is that he want to blow putin while caressing his balls?
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:04:44
Which is why it needs to be dynamically adjusted
@_date: 2017-01-15 09:09:23
Nope I can't, so instead of one source let's go with multiple. Of course I am open, give me sources and facts which aren't crackpot stories.
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:34:16
So your solution is to keep it at a place where it becomes useless?
It is not free, but it is a hell of a lot better than the current issue. Also your last point doesn't make sense, there are issues where this is true but it is easy to find areas where this is not, i.e. credit cards. Traffic has a natural capacity constraint, this does not, or at least it is theoretically much larger than demand.
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:04:47
Good so we agree the techs are different, thus comparing bitcoin with traffic is completely invalid because the constraints are fundamentally different.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:05:02
Yes it will. 
There are no costs associated with including another transaction in your block, thus I will include any transaction as long as it is non-zero, and even zero is something I wouldn't technically care about. Thus this drives down the price to effectively zero.
There are fixed costs but the variable costs are basically non existent.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:31:27
Okay, but unless I am misunderstanding something wouldnt that first be a problem in a long long time?
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:39:31
No, having no variable cost will do that. Please take at least one class in some type of economics before you ramble on.
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:38:05
Without evidence? Literally the entire fucking security apparatus is flowing over with evidence?
@_date: 2016-11-13 16:06:25
No it isn't, it is funding a demand. Stop protecting pedophilia acts. Not to mention the fact that you are violating someone's fucking privacy right by looking at pictures of them getting raped. So no they are not thr same
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:33:17
No shit, just like fiat is money
@_date: 2016-11-13 16:24:17
Ahahahaha this is some serious euphoric shit right here.
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:37:53
Thats like saying my company will never be successful because I cant serve the entire world. Increasing capacity is a start.
@_date: 2016-11-14 07:26:10
If someone did that and someone else profited off it making it more likely to happen again then thay should absolutely be illegal to watch. Just like snuff porn
@_date: 2016-11-13 16:04:08
Great then how does trump hold any appeal what soever
@_date: 2019-08-23 08:14:38
Apparently not enough
@_date: 2017-01-15 08:46:40
Okay your souces for why this isn't true is because CIA has done shady shit before and a YouTube video. Are you daft or something? 
Also linking wikileaks, they have kinda ruined their own reputation as an unbiased source.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:40:49
Okay, this mining is essentially a simple repeated game with all players setting a minimum fee to obtain share of market. variable costs are virtually zero, thus i reduce the min fee to virtually zero. The only nash equilibrium in this game is where all players essentially have zero fees.
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:27:21
Because stocks have been outgrowing the value of land and gold significantly.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:26:36
Once again this makes zero sense.
1. A gantt chart is not the point of a class, it is like saying that you got a C because you dont understand bar charts, it literally just displays data / or in the case of a gantt chart a timeline
2. Regression has zero to do with gantt charts.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:55:53
Awesome so you do not know what money is, got it.
Money is a construct that act as a medium of exchange/store of wealth, it can be seashells, it can be paper, it can be gold.
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:33:08
Please also read something outside your one sphere
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:17:00
The point is not to pay back the debt in time of plenty, the point is to outgrow it so it becomes smaller and smaller compared to your GDP or given that you tack of new debt it increases but the ratio remains stable
@_date: 2019-08-22 10:24:49
Also wrong debt is bad if its ratio to GDP spirals out of control.
Your second point is 1. wrong 2. the economy will grow forever, or at least for the next many many many years, you do not need resources to advance, that is what tech is for.....
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:15:11
A gantt chart is the death of your GPA? It is basically a time overview, it can't be the death of anyones GPA as it is not a serious part of any degree, let a lone an economics degree.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:25:10
Eh no? There is no value lost, you increase your absolute debt but debt to gdp remains constant?
@_date: 2016-12-29 08:55:43
If you are really at hbs and can't see the legal ramifications then i am baffled.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:18:28
Of course it will cause issues,  but the benefit of capital flexibility far outweighs it. Seriously, if you believe companies and/or governments should have zero debt then you are delusional and have no idea how to create any lasting profit.
@_date: 2019-08-22 22:20:00
Okay so you truly do not understand what money is. Awesome.
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:28:32
Dude you are literally not understanding what money is.
The value of gold is by definition set by society and its value is a construct. Seriously stop being a maximalist who literally does not understand anything about any economic subject at all.


This is literally way medium of exchange means, which is one of the defining points of money, which is why paper money is well, money.....
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:00:00
Yeah, show me any other country with an economic system similar to the US that has gone bust.
Show me the evidence for hyperinflation in the US
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:57:59
Also wrong, if the ratio stays constant the demand for money will go up with the same degree as debt increases money supply, ergo this does not cause inflation.
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:26:45
Increasing money supply only causes inflation if you dont increase the demand for money as well.
And also your last statement is straight up false.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:21:49
It will never be insolvent, especially because a large component is held by US investors pouring the money back into the economy
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:35:54
So? An economy can grow in deflationary periods
This is seriously getting tiresome, get out of your little bubble please
@_date: 2019-08-22 10:23:20
Your first line tells the point, the US is the biggest economy globally by a large margin.
Comparing the US to the babylonian empire is downright ludicrous.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:19:55
It wont? No one will make a "run" at the US economy, because if they do then the debt they hold will be worth less meaning, and if they continue to run at it, then other investors will buy up debt at a discount basically amounting to arbitrage because there is no way the US will go bankrupt, that is virtually an impossibility.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:22:47
You made the claim you have to prove it.
Also look at a graph of economic growth and one of inflation for the US economy, spoiler alert growth is higher than inflation.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:02:00
A hedge against debt does not make sense, you cant hedge against the general concept of debt, you can hedge against inflation of a specific currency, currencies, stocks, specific assets and a million other things, but saying I buy btc to hedge against some unknown entity "debt" is nonsense.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:08:03
1. dont use tradingeconomics it is a shit source.
2. You do not understand what economic growth is, as in at all
   1. The price of gold is not equal to inflation, gold is a finite resource and as the population grows and we find more areas of use for it the price will likely increase above inflation.
   2. Advances in tech does constitute economic growth, that is literally part of it, it helps increase productivity of material and immaterial goods
   3. wtf does "buys phone" mean
   4. Land is again a finite resource, likely increasing significantly above inflation, as there are more people
Please stop using economic terms you dont understand
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:20:40
You do realise that the inflation helps the US with its debt problem right?
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:10:26
Holy shit this is nonsense. One is a medium of exchange the other isn't. Tadah.
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:40:05
What on earth are you saying?
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:45:24
Key word used to be. And no currently gold is not a medium of exchange in any serious context, at all.
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:26:17

@_date: 2018-11-24 19:47:44
Jesus christ you are a moron. Not inherently realising that there are significant risks in Bitcoin is not helping it, just because you are trying to pump up the value.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:47:35
Yeah, because it is a speculative asset, why would we want another one of those? Especially one that has no intrinsic value.
Moreover, comparing visa and gold is downright dumb, one is a company facilitating the USD as a medium of exchange the other as a n asset RARELY used as a medium of exchange. You wouldn't compare the total worth of all oil in existence with the market cap of Tesla, because that would be stupid.
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:34:02

@_date: 2016-09-23 20:26:29

@_date: 2016-09-17 18:28:52
Who cares if it reaches exactly 21 mil, what matters is when you have effectively mined all btc.
@_date: 2016-09-18 08:56:39
At that point you are not caring about what happens when 21 million btc has been mined you just use it as a measure of time.

@_date: 2016-10-29 08:54:49
And who do you knoq who puts all their savings and income in ONE small cap stock?
@_date: 2016-10-04 06:48:45
