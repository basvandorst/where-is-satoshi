I doubt he calls the cops on every single person that comes to his door

Yes, that's why mailmen are federal employees.
No but really, all joking aside, the 911 call was officially a suspicious person's report so not the mail, but the loitering.

because one password can get you the entirety of 400mil of money that can be easily laundered, used for criminal deeds, and the account cant be shut down or held because of the us govt
edit: 400 million dollars not 400k

Yeah, the article that she wrote is obviously unbiased. I doubt that she would incriminate herself in an article, especially when she feels like her actions are justified.
Just because something is not said does not mean it's untrue (or true either). Do you really think dorian would elaborate on something so small as how the information got out vs. the actual content of the article, saying how he's the creator of bitcoin with 400 million stashed away as a rainy day fund?
As I've been saying, I never even so much as hinted at the misconduct you're thinking of such as violence. I'm merely saying that she was more likely than not harassing him. Was it enough for legal action? I can't say because I don't know but the simple fact is that it escalated to the point of where the police were called.
What do you think happened? Did Dorian pick up the phone and call 911 when he heard the word bitcoin used in a sentence?

Idk why this is getting downvoted, it really show's the lack of journalistic ethics used and the result of the article being published.

so you're saying she said "can i talk to you about bit coin? it's ok if you don't want to, i'll just leave you alone" and he called the cops on her? This is news week's first week back to print and she felt the pressure of needing a cover story, I doubt she wasn't harassing him.

I'm not saying this because I want to attack her, I'm just saying chances are, she actually was harassing him and the police being called is a strong indication of that.
Where'd he have the cops escort her away to? Off of his private property and onto the sidewalk by his house? The police don't work like that and more often then not serve as a mediator guiding the parties to the easiest resolution (which is doing the interview). At most, they would have told dorian that he can move into a hotel to avoid her and if he wanted them to take her away (or do anything), he could press charges or file for a restraining order. A guy like dorian, given that ultimatum, would most certainly give in and conduct the interview.
I never inferred that something terrible must have happened. 
As I've been saying (and "inferring"), she was probably just pestering him for a couple days until he got tired of the paparazzi-esque behavior and called the cops. You don't call the police over nothing.
Edit: There's a line that has to be drawn between real journalism and acting like the paparazzi. The difference with a journalist staying after seeing flashing lights at a protest vs this is the reason why the police are there in the first place.

Harassment isn't only violence

she sat on his front porch for an hour and he tried to make her leave, saying the quote she got in the process of trying to get her off of his private property and then she wrote a letter and put it in the mail slot and left. When she came back, the sheriffs were there

I don't believe you're who you say you are. you must post a high quality close up photo of your drivers license, front and back and under a blacklight.
