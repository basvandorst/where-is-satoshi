Fair enough. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:25:15
Why would someone buy physical coins (you know what I mean! :) ) to hedge a futures contract? Isn't the whole point of buying the contract to have a delta short or long position that is leveraged if you are speculating? 
Now, if you said that someone bought/sold a contract to hedge their physical coin, I could see that. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:39:45
What tax reasons are those?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:07:29
Doesn't make sense because it implies that long and short future holders have to buy/sell BTC to settle -- except for futures contracts are cash settled, and no Bitcoin actually has to be purchased.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:53:55
It is true and they expect you to pay their share in fiat. This is well known.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:37:06
Ok..good. I agree 100% with that
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:46:25
So pay taxes on a $10k sell in 2019 vs paying taxes on a $19k sell in 2018?
Who does that make sense for?
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:33:38
It is very clear now in the US from the new tax bill. Crypto to crypto is not a like kind exchange and is a taxable event. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:50:17
That is for like kind exchanges (crypto for crypto). And even that is suspect as there is no clear guidance that it was allowed before 2018. 
But it is crystal clear that “spending” crypto is the same as bartering, and is very much a federal taxable event for capital gains. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:22:05
How are they avoiding tax implications now when the tax law has made it clear that crypto to crypto is now a taxable event?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:08:22
Amen...BS and wishful thinking
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:49:38
When the new tax bill was signed. 1/1/2018. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:15:52
Ok, thanks...makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:43:53
Explain to me how that is a "tax reason"
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:35:17
Yes and no. He can’t delay paying 2017 taxes, or there will be penalties. And he can realize the loss in 2018, but a max of $3k per year— he will have to carry the rest forward. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:04:09
Or if you paid for something in Bitcoin -- that is a taxable transaction.
Or if you converted it to another Crypto -- that is a taxable transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:39:28
That paragraph is not about a like-kind exchange. It is about "spending" crypto on something. Like buying a computer with BTC -- you have to pay the capital gains on the BTC as if you converted it to USD to pay for the computer.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:42:44
That is a taxable event and any gain you made on the coin you used is capital gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:23:12
Yes...no different than selling one stock for another. Whatever your capital gain on the BTC was at the moment of exchange is taxable. But then that amount becomes your basis for IOTA.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:40:40
Agreed. There really is no substantive basis for Section 1031 treatment of crypto
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:25:55
Yes. Currency gains are taxable events as well.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:23:45
Fair enough, but why bitcoin in that case versus some other crypto that doesn’t have the inherent scaling problem?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:23:17
Wow! Aren’t you just a Billy BadAss!
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:47:02
That is debatable. It is well-defined going forward in 2018 that that loophole is closed. But there is no clear-cut guidance that it is allowed before that (the IRS has been quiet about that), and all signs point to it is not applicable.
Plus -- it would be very easy to argue that swapping BTC for IOTA is not a like-kind exchange, as they are two different assets.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:21:39
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:59:55
Truth hurts, huh? :D
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:00:52
Tax on the gain on the original coin before the trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:29:39
It is shorthand for "with" -- usually from the medical field
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:21:43






Sorry, but that is wrong. For tax purposes you use the trade date and not the settlement date. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:35:10
Yeah...keep telling yourself that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:45:05
Seriously, what is a half-truth about what I said? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:06:03
 But that is ok, because you only pay the higher tax rate on the amount ABOVE that bracket—not your whole income. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:02:53
Serious question: what fundamentals? 
It is not very good as a currency -- the fees and slow TX confirmations show that.
And it is not a very good store of value (you don't have 30% monthly swings in "stores of value")
So, with those two things dismissed, that fundamentals are there other than scarcity?
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:27:41
There are lots of ways to avoid paying taxes...doesn't mean that it is legal. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:01:35
That number come out of thin air?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:43:10
Don’t be condescending. No different from moving from one futures contract to another. You are moving from an asset that has one value to one that has another value. And you are moving from one block chain to another. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:53:00
"I will give you 10 ETH for 1 BTC" is the explicit definition of bartering.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:11:49
Deleted his post in shame
@_date: 2018-03-01 05:19:04
Buy and sell at same price so net gain is zero (proceeds = basis). 
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:54:49
Until it does fail. Lots of people have lost lots of money "hodling" something until it has no value any longer.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:02:19
Tee hee....cute. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:13:10
What does that have to do with anything? That is like saying a futures contract really isn’t that because it doesn’t tell the future. 
Nothing you say changes the simple fact: when trading one asset (regardless of how that asset is tracked, stored, described or sold) for another, you are bartering. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:19:46
But buying something WITH bitcoin is a taxable event
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:24:32
Are you in the US? Then yes, especially in 2018 with the tax law clarifications. Every conversion to a new coin is assumed to be converted to USD first, and then used to purchase that new coin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:36:25
In the US, if you sell a bitcoin with capital gains, or use it to purchase something and it has gained in value, you most declare that transaction on your taxes.
While we have a voluntary reporting system, you are liable for your taxes, and if you don't, you can be tried for tax evasion.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:00:30
No different than stocks. If I sold some stocks and made $50k on that trade, but sold another one I lost $30k on, I only pay taxes on the $20k net I made. 
I am assuming they are all short term capital gains. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:15:48
Serious question: what is the value of moving to tether, versus just going back to fiat?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:27:44
Ok, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:03:56
Oh, got it -- never mind. You are one of those. I thought you were asking a serious question.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:12:41


Easily -- it is an asset that can gain value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:26:59
yes! -- But then you can claim the capital loss on the other coin, with a limit of $3k per year total capital loss.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:34:55
Before the tax bill update, people were interpreting IRC Section 1031 (a)(1) to use a like-kind exchange because the code only said -- "property".
The new tax bill deletes "property" and replaces it with "real property", so like kind exchanges are now ONLY limited to real property.
Therefore, because it is no longer a like kind exchange, an exchange from one coin/protocol to another is considered a "barter" and a taxable event.
Need anything else?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:36:58
You had one taxable event selling something you bought at $5k for 10k. Owe capital gains on $5k. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:17:13
Yep, no different. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:51:38
sum of all gains minus the sum of all loses -- that is what is your taxable gain.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:57:33
Net for the year. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:29:43
Based on the transaction date. You will have until 4/15/2018 to pay the taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:23:34
It is clear that it is now with the new tax bill. Pre-2018 it was never truly made clear by the IRS that it was a like-kind exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:22:37
Use at your own peril -- no guidance from IRS, and no one can give you a clear answer. It is an aggressive interpretation to take it, especially with the clarification in the new tax law.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:03:49
correct. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:43:59
And that is your prerogative, but in the US, when you buy something with bitcoin, there is an assumed transaction to USD first, and you owe on that capital gains (if any). 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:45:18
No, that is just saying that section 1031 exchanges are now limited to real estate only. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:19:56
Yes 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:01:54
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:03:20
That would be news to me....I don't think that is true.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:29:27
I don’t with stocks, I list a roll up for each equity. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:30:50
It is crystal clear in 2018 that 1031 no longer applies because it is only for "real property" now.
Using pre-2018 is an aggressive intreputation with no guidance by the IRS one way or the other.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:55:31
You pay taxes on the sum of all of your gains minus the sum of all of your loses IN THAT YEAR. If your losses exceeds your gains you can deduct up to $3k per year off your normal income. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:34:00
Ok, great. But crypto to crypto is a barter which is taxable. 
Conversion of one asset to another asset. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:22:46
In the US, spending bitcoin is a taxable event -- and you owe capital gains on the difference of what you paid for that bitcoin and how much you spent on the item.
Bought 1 Bitcoin for a $1 -- and just spent it to purchase a $10k car today? You now own capital gains taxes on the $9999 gain
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:50:50
No, it is based on your actual earnings.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:24:54
Yes, but you are limited to $3k a year total on your return (all gains for the year minus all losses -- capped at a maximum of negative $3k).
Any leftover loss that you don't claim can be rolled over to the next year.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:25:19
yes! And it based on the gain in the bitcoin the moment you made the trade for ETH.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:15:36
You should have. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:37:59
For transactions that happen in 2018. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:11:55
Assuming all of that happened in the same year, your total gains is zero and you owe no tax. 
Sell the first one in year 1, and the second one in year 2 and then you owe taxes on $100k gain in year 2, and then can deduct your $100k loss against other gains in year 2. 
Make sense?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:34:15
Not clear if the OP realizes that those profits have to be taxed first - or if he meant buying something with unrealized bitcoin "profit" in the form of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:33:43
It is also taxable if you use it to purchase goods or services. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:35:12
Sorry, I thought it was pretty obvious we were talking about taxation at the federal level and not the state level. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:19:44
No. Ohio is not collecting bitcoin. It is using bitpay. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:28:30
Learn something new: didn’t realize crypto was not subjected to the wash sale rules. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:43:45
And pay capital gains on every transaction? No thanks. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:27:48
The US will never allow for bitcoin, or any other crypto, to usurp the power of its fiat currency by  allowing for it to be used tax free on a transactional basis. Just like how bartering is a taxable transaction and buying with FX is a taxable transaction. 
Never going to happen. 
And the government did not set up the futures market for bitcoin.  The market owner did.
