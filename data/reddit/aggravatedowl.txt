Harassment and calls to violence are not political speech though. Jones is a radical who inspires people to violence. If he were a Muslim Obama would have droned him years ago.

Well obviously it's hard to link directly to examples now. But [here's Secular Talk covering a fairly freaky example of Alex Jones calling for violence against somebody](
Also if you actually look at what Maxine Waters actually wrote in her actual tweet. It said to hold members of the cabinet accountable in public. Which is not radical fucking at all. You SHOULD hold politicians accountable. What you should not do is go off on crazy lunatic rants about how it's a moral imperative that you kill all of your political adversaries, which is what Jones calls for on his show pretty regularly. Fascism is a right wing knee jerk reaction to the imagined "evils" of largely self imagined "socialism". You nut jobs are so scared of your own shadows your going to destroy this country and everything she stands for. Personally I'm glad my Grandfather didn't live long enough to see the evil of last century he fought against rear it's ugly head in America.

I mean have you watched his show? He goes on there screaming about people being demons and they need to be killed. Hell that one poor family has had to move MULTIPLE times and hire private security.
And let's not forget the lunatic who after listening to him go on about the evil pedophile pizza joint showed up with a gun.
Alex Jones is an unhinged lunatic and he has brought every bit of this on himself. I wouldn't do business with him. Why do you think other people should be forced to?

Is PayPal a monopoly? I'm pretty sure there's other ways of sending people money. Or have I been missing a major thing for all these years?

So dumb.
