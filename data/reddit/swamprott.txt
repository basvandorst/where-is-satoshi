Ahhh yes, the old stoch RSI, BB pinch ascending wedge, bull pennant flag. If I didnt know any better, I'd say it's a strong indicator of a up down flatline movement. long your shorts and short your longs, the fd calls are volumizing the satoshis.

folks I'm a noob, no question about it. I'm still struggling to understand some concepts of btc. I have a question about adaptation and how loaning btc would work? Like, say I wanted to buy a car using btc, where would one go to borrow the predetermined amount of btc necessary to purchase the car?
