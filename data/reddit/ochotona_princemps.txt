Source? It was my understanding that money-in the sense of a standardized unit of account &amp; exchange- did not exist before centralized authorities emerged. Before that, you had only had barter and quasi-currency commodity trading. But I'm no expert....

As a lawyer, I'm a little curious how you think civil judgments get enforced.

[The current labor force participation rate is on par with where we were in the late 1970s, and much higher that it was throughout most of the 20th century.](
It is true that participation rates are lower now than they were from 1980-2008. Some of that is the recession, some of that is aging boomers. It might be that the participation rates above 65% were an unsustainable historical anomaly. 
In any event, the current percentage of people working is not unprecendented, or a sign of crisis--to the contrary, the rates are more in line with historical norms.

That depends very heavily on your definition of "victim". As I tried to convey in my first response, the people who are stuck paying for the police, firefighters, coast guard, and the military, while others shirk taxes, are likely to feel taken advantage of--even "victimized".

I know this will fall on deaf ears, but here goes:
In developed countries, protecting property is an expensive service the government provides to everyone, mostly for free. Your safe gets robbed, police try to recover your property; your factory bursts into flames, firefighters try to put it out; your ship is attacked by pirates, the navy defends you; your accountant embezzles your money, the courts/sheriff force repayment-etc., etc.
A person who benefits from this public protection but doesn't pay property or income taxes is free riding on everyone else who does pay. In essence, the tax scofflaw is stealing from the community. And if enough people didn't pay, the whole system of communal protection would break down. Most people think that would be a disastrous outcome, such that a non-voluntary tax system is worth it.

A "crime" is just what the society deems forbidden.
I, and the vast majority of people, think there are some situations in which compelling people to do things against their will is justified--taxation for the common defense of life and property, quarantines, the draft, and so on--because the alternative would be terrible for everyone.
 You're free to label that "criminal behavior", but it's really just a dispute over the appropriate relationship between society and the individual. Most people think that are situations in which the group is right to force individuals to do certain things against their will.

Seems a bit Manichean. It's possible that the economy can be neither great, nor terrible, right?
Low wage growth, lower  labor force participation rates, and spiking education and housing costs are big negatives. 
 But, the overall unemployment rate is pretty low, delinquent household indebtedness is falling and overall household debt growth is pretty restrained. Over the past six months energy and food prices are generally low or falling relative to other goods. Medical and tech innovation is proceeding at a decent clip. State and federal budgets are significantly improved, too.
Overall, feels pretty meh to me.
