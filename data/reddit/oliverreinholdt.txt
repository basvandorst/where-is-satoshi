Hi I've been using Bitcoinpaperwallet a lot of times now, and been using it to gift to friends on special occasions. I also ordered plastic bags and stickers from your website, and the price is amazing, compared to what you get. I really love the design of the wallets, though I would wish there was a freely available PSD template, for me to edit with my own design, so I could personalize my wallets even more. I'm not the most Photoshop savy person you see, and so far my attempts to edit the current design, has been a failure. A ugly embarrassing failure.
Thank you, and keep up the awesome work!

I'm giving my brother a paper wallet for christmas. I will be giving personal instructions, during the holidays. I think that a personal introduction by his side, will help him understand it better, as he can ask questions simultaneously. Of course the Christmas traditions in Denmark is a bit different than other countries (presents on the evening on December 24.)
