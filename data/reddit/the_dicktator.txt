Seconded. I got a G2 a week after they were released and could not be more happy with it.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:28:42
No, it's all grouped into one transaction as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:59:32
As much as I'm sure you're right, something about this seems... risky. I am an utter newbie to bitcoin though so I could be totally wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:20:39
Ok, I tried to transfer and it told me I didn't have enough to cover the 0.01 BTC fee. That much? Really? Ok, whatever, I decrease the amount by .01 to cover it. Now it's telling me I don't have enough for the **.05** BTC fee.
Now what? I really don't wanna spend that much in fees on a single transaction. Is there any other way to fix this?
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:58:20
Blockchain is the one I mainly use.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:46:51
FINALLY a real actual answer! Thank you!! I'll try this right now and see what happens.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:08:59
I realize it's technically gambling, and I'm fine with losing a little money, but I don't want to end up accidentally losing a bunch.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:00:58
I don't have an extra address in bitcoin-qt... :(
@_date: 2013-05-24 17:06:08
If people are willing to pay that much then more power to them. I was just saying that compared to some of the more popular mining GPUs, these things are much more pricey than they should be.
@_date: 2013-05-24 17:00:23
For 300 Mh/s? You can get a GPU that does that for under/right at $200. I just got a 7970 that gets 650 Mh/s for about $375.

No, I sent a payment of .01 yesterday while blockchain was down from my bitocin-qt client. When I came back to my blockchain address today, everything left in my account had gotten sent to a "change" address. Idk what the hell to do to fix it.

1. By the time you got the Jalepeno, at the rate the difficulty is increasing lately, it would be an extremely long time before you saw a return on the investment (if ever).
2. Make sure you don't put more money into Bitcoin than you're willing to lose. No matter what the super-enthusiasts say, it's still an extremely volatile currency as of right now and has no guarantee whatsoever of staying afloat in the future. Invest accordingly.
3. Unless you plan on investing a few thousand dollars into mining hardware, you're better off just buying some BTC at this point, or selling stuff for it. Try using [BitMit]( it's like the Bitcoin version of eBay. You could also try or some of the other Bitcoin subs around Reddit if you're interested in selling services instead.

No, he was asking if I had a new address in my address book that wasn't there before. Which I don't.
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:38:27
Hang on and I'll upload/link a couple screencaps of what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2013-05-24 16:38:32
At ~$150, these would be amazing. At ~$400-500, though, they are **grossly** overpriced.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:08:02
I have 2-factor enabled. And idk about any IDs, but the address it got sent to was 18o2Gw43X3TvbAiNd2SPGRx69quPGTJtSP.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:14:14
I tried that earlier and when I tried to send them all, it said "you don't have enough to cover for the 0.01 BTC fee." And I thought really? That much for 1 transaction? Alright, whatever, it's only a dollar. So then I took it down by .01 BTC to cover the fee and it told me now there's a **.05** BTC fee.
I'm not willing to spend 5+ dollars worth of BTC on one transaction. Is there any other way to fix this?
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:33:37
No no, they *are* on my wallet.dat, but are *not* in my blockchain.info wallet. That's what I'm saying, blockchain sent a bunch of it to a change address and idk how to get it back into my main address. My bitcoin-qt is totally synced up and fine though.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:06:52
read about it briefly in the bitcoin wiki. I can't find anything explaining how to get my BTC back from it though. And had this been a small amount I wouldn't care, but it was about .41 BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:37:02
How do I import the private key? Also, I don't think it's me, I think it's a glitch with qt's auto-fee system.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:52:43
And how might I do that?
@_date: 2013-05-26 04:34:03
Thank you!

I made a backup right before they went down with about .41 BTC in my wallet yesterday, and now I have .01 BTC. The only BTC I sent yesterday was to peerbet, for .01BTC. I did not send $40 worth of BTC to some strange address while blockchain was down yesterday, but it's saying I did. And even after importing my backup it's saying I only have .01 BTC left. Does anyone know what might have caused this? Because I'm freaking the hell out right now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:12:21
Happened, happens, will happen.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:26:01
So, like, a week ago?
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:20:46
Ok this didn't work. My qt wallet is fine, it's my blockchain.info *online* wallet that is out of whack. Got any suggestions?
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:53:15
Ok, so how exactly do I go about getting it back?
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:59:09
Yeah, except for the fact that there is a huge difference between a convicted criminal and an alleged criminal.
