That's where I feel like the price has to plateau out just so it can be used in a sane manner in your local surroundings. I don't know how that would be achieved though.

I'm curious how this works out with fluctuation in value though. A $100 ticket would've been 0.016 BTC a few weeks ago and 0.008 BTC today, if I'm mathing it right. Assuming the Mavs are paying their bills in fiat, will the price they need to charge change daily on the site? Hourly?

Daaaaang this looks nice. I can never go back to a manual-entry tracker like a plebe. 
BitUniverse app is doing this too, but I gotta say this UI is sexier. Nice to see API importing apps, hope more people adopt them.

Bill was introduced and sponsored by this Republican representative. I wonder what the impetus was.

Musk is an entertaining distraction so we don't talk about the launches at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, and to make us think regular civilians might go to Mars. Bread and circuses folks.

I was just googling this question, the only one I could find is here: 
It's open source on github. Looks good so far, I'm using it.

I wonder about the public ledger problem. Zcash preferred over Monero though?

Almost 60% of the US federal budget is various forms of welfare (Medicare and SS being the bulk) and federal spending is ~20% of GDP, if I'm reading right. 
We disbursed about $33 billion to 184 (!) countries in economic assistance. 96% of the countries in the world. Even China. Wait, China? WTF.
That doesn't count things like military assistance, or the Navy keeping shipping lanes open...
The government of Canada estimates 26 of every Canadian dollar spent by the government is a direct welfare payment to persons. And there also, fed spending is about 20% of the economy. 
I don't even want to imagine what's going on in Venezuela right now. 
As far as war goes, we're only involved in Afghanistan right now, right? And Yemen indirectly. Obama pulled out of Iraq. Trump pulled out of Syria. 
We're not conducting warfare on South America or Asia or Africa, as far as I know. Drone campaign is probably still ongoing in Pakistan.

I always wonder why ltc isn't more commonly adopted. I like it better than eth or BTC as far as a transfer medium goes. Which is.....kind of what a currency is supposed to be.

I don't get how this was a high level KGB operation in which Putin may be implicated but... they had to mine their own Bitcoin to pay for it

Yes, you individually, this is what I'm asking. Compared to individual pride or selfishness. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:56:09
Well, sure, but when they "divide into tribes" is often when they do their best good, too. Are you more likely to donate to a person or group you feel sympathy for, or just any random human? People help out their family and neighbors (and fellow churchgoers since we're talking about 'religious pride'), they don't just distribute money at random.

Asking him or her if it had ever affected them personally was a rhetorical question, what it asks is whether these are really common problems, or even the primary problems facing the vast majority of humans across the globe in their day to day lives. If you've personally suffered from them, that's terrible; if you suffer from them daily, that's a tragedy; or you've been brave enough to put yourself out there in politically contentious public arenas, that's a step above the level most people are on.

Yes, money flowed into bitcoin as people thought they would make money on it. The massive pump was not fueled by actual usage. 
The thing is, if Bitcoin is only or chiefly a value asset and not a currency, is it even a good one? Yes it's good in that it's unrepeatable portions of code, but is it the best example of that? Is there another coin that handles value storage concerns better? Will another one be developed? Is one blockchain really a decent store of value if there's a bunch of alternative blockchains?
Honest questions, not fud, I'd really like to see this work out.

Setting yourself up as a protestor or counterprotester and watching the ire of the other side is not a *common situation* and therefore not an example of 


And you were being protected by riot police, who are employed by a nation, right? Structures which this post is saying are unnecessary. Officers who do their job with sworn loyalty and duty to that structure...do I really have to drag out the irony of mentioning them?

You pay for fire stations because your fire emanating from your own mistake may take out a neighbor's house easily. It's not like several major cities haven't had great fires, I don't blame them for being particular about this.

If you can't imagine selfishness affecting daily interactions more than "nationalism" or"religious zealotry" you're either a hermit or you're trying to be obtuse.
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:59:09
This is why we can't have nice things. 
Someone I know had an accidental fire. Not their fault, really. Their house almost abuts their neighbor's house. If they didn't pay for the "correct" level (or any) of this fictional free market fire insurance.....
And no, nobody has a free health market. The US is very socialistic so people aren't actually dying in the streets for lack of care. (Sorry, but they're not.)
Everything is a tradeoff if you live in a society, between mutual benefit and individual freedom. You can live off the grid if you choose to maximize freedom. Even Bitcoin has a social compact in the form of open source development and community consensus. 
Honestly, the tribalism of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin Cash anyone?) is some of the silliest versions of intense tribalism there is, all high stress and low yield. You might as well get tribal about something that matters or is fun, like your country of origin, or a sportsball team.

Countries that speak English, Canada, Australia, America, the UK. The post is by an Australian. These nations consistently score extremely low on multiple [corruption indices]( and there's a reason for that. 
When you get pulled over by the cops, do you have to pay him a bribe? When you try to fill out your new baby's birth certificate, do you have to pay a bribe? These things are common in many nations that are considered more or less developed. 
If we live in some libertarian blockchain utopia, what's keeping the big miners from charging exorbitant fees to register....whatever it is we're going to register....on these government-replacing blockchains? 
Corruption is more common in the world than the residents of English-common-law nations realize. We're certainly not the only nations who have fought to reduce it; but we definitely take it for granted and think humanity always behaves this way now. Hence my pointing this out on an English post in an English-speaking subreddit. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:07:59
This is just stupid. When have you ever been affected by either one? Pretty sure selfishness is the main driver of suffering.

Humans typically aren't ready for anything, dude. If we waited until every participant was ideologically and morally ready, we wouldn't have democracy, or egalitarianism, or a free press, or the internet.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:01:25
If you're in an English-speaking country, you don't have to deal with corruption on a daily basis, your currency is solid, and your markets are sturdy and dependable. Your culture is so efficient and egalitarian and tightly controlled in you don't even know what it would be like if the reins were loosened. 
**EDIT:** lest anyone think I'm just being racist (?) or...anglocentric? Here's an example, a certain famous cryptocurrency's cryptographer just complained on Twitter about getting stopped constantly. You can read all about [cops in Morocco]( it's fun. You get pulled over: 


Cryptocurrency markets give an indication of how modern people behave without judicious and prudent government. Cheating, scamming, and clear price manipulation are commonplace. Imagine if that was the case when you were buying milk and bread instead of buying electronic cash. Or imagine if these people ran what minimal law enforcement we need. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:04:21
Yes, people who don't like their own country protect it better than people who do, of course...
