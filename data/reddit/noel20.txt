For those who don't wanna click through, here is the text
When I first started writing this blog, the price of a single bitcoin was around $230 or so. Today the price of a single bitcoin is beyond $17,000 along with a whole slew of new financial assets that have been created by no governments or bankers; but by cryptography, computers, and coders alone: cryptocurrencies.
This new kind of money serves not the interests of the banking and corporate elites, or the corrupt government ministers who kowtow to them; but the people who control them alone.
We have seen cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero gain +10,000% returns over the last several years, and they simply continue their climb against all of the harping of bankers, economist, and purported ‘experts’ of finance. They  have declared cryptocurrencies are a scourge and something to be detested; a grievous wound against all of society, and they must be destroyed.  Again and again we hear from them that this is a bubble, that it has no social value, and that it is going to ‘crash’–and yet we find that the honey badger of money continues its slog upward and to the right despite all of their raging cries.
This is by no mistake, as cryptocurrencies are fundamentally better at storing value than any fiat currencies in existence today. This is because the fixed and known monetary supplies and inflation rates of cryptocurrencies; but more importantly, the social consciousness and consensus that allows for them to exist. People can now control their wealth with nothing more than the power of cryptography. Cryptocurrencies are rewriting the entire way that money is understood and used–and with that, who gets to control and benefit from these systems.
*Saving in fiat money is for chumps*


–John Maynard Keynes
Today, each and every form of fiat money is nothing more than a legal tender that holds value simply because governments command it. However, if we look over the course of history; again, and again, we see states fail, governments collapse, and their money inflate to nothing. This is not by mistake, but by design. Just look at what has happened in Venezuela over the last few years.
What those in contemporary finance and government fail to see is that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a radically departure from state-sponsored financial systems and the tyranny that they enable. For the better part of modern human history we have simply had to deal with the fact that government officials could show up at our places of business or our homes, rob us at gun point and call it legal. That they could fictionalize up mountains of money and give it to their corrupt banking and corporate friends, and tell us it was for our own good.
Again and again, we see the powers-that-be prod us down the road to serfdom, and tell us it is the yellow brick road to the Emerald City. We have seen what happens to those who follow that path, and the poverty it creates for all of us.
The revolution that we have all been waiting for is finally here, and **it is the radical divorce of state and money from each other**. Governments were never entitled to steal the wealth of the world for themselves and for their barbaric and unholy purposes. We finally have a way to resist their tyranny and fight back with economic means alone. Just as we once saw the radical divorce of church and state fundamentally change society for the better, we will once again witness such a radical epochal change–but this time it will be from the separation of money from the state.
Those of us who hodl crypto know and understand that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have nothing to do with money. The true purpose of cryptocurrencies is to create a new form of economic power that will be the harbinger of a new society. A society where economic power is outside and beyond the control of the state, and the monstrous banking and financial sectors that they have fused with. It is from this base of power that we are creating that a whole new society within the framework of the web.
Bitcoin will become the most value asset in history not only because it is a better form of money, but because of the astounding personal economic power it creates. Through tearing out the economic base of the corrupt systems of fiat money; we can create a new and more egalitarian society using the power of the blockchain and the internet. The banners we will raise in this new society will have the following inscribed upon them for all to see and choose to follow if they wish:
*To each according to their code, to each according to their keys!*

I think this is one of the things that will drive both the adoption of altcoins and other methods of digital asset transfer (OT). I also believe that as mining services commercialize, they will be able to 'negotiate' the hashing rate amongst their mining oligopoly.  This will allow for them to defuse the cost of mining, and to offer long-term bitcoin sales contracts. This will lead to a real stabilization of the price and the ability for it to do much more commerce. 
As horrible as this sounds, I think it is great. 
Bitcoin has served its purpose. Crypto-currencies are a reality now. No matter how much governments and banks want to close Pandora's box it won't happen. The commercialization of Bitcoin will allow for the technology of Crypto-currencies to be spread to people all around the global. This will strip governments of their power to tax and will allow for people to assure the safety of the fruits of their labor once and for all.

I think much of the economic explanation can be provide by Hayek's [The denationlization of money](
Hayek theorized that if currencies were 'denationailzed' private entities would spring up, and the ones that would be the most successful would be the ones that provided the most benefits to the most people. I believe this idea applies to bitcoin and alt-coins quite well in the context of how they preform against fiat currencies.

“The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as U. S. Steel illustrate the same process of industrial mutation-if I may use that biological term-that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism.”
–Joseph Schumpeter in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy

Thanks for the well-thought out comment. I have to point out to you:


But recent history would show this to be false. Governments are apparatuses of general theft for the capitalist class, and the war industry--not the working class. I know the idea of a just government feels good, but it's just a lie--we are the aborted remains of a republic that died long ago. There will be no liberty found within the confines of a State such as this.
Here is my own response to [Krugman's Bits and Barberism](
Nice to see the Cross of Gold speech mentioned. The late 19th century what the silver democrats were pretty much trying to do was break the hold international bankers had on gold, and in the US we had enough silver to do that. Alas, that war was lost, but we were not crucified on a cross of gold--it was one of  paper, with the motto "In God We Trust" on the back of it.

Indeed, but one of the reasons that peercoin has a 0.1 ppc transaction fee is to fighting blockchain bloating. The high fee is designed so people are not moving peercoin about alot--it's just too expensive. That's one of the ways it also acts more as a storage of value too.

I believe that cryptocurrencies will rise up to take their place--along with all kinds of other crazy shit like new states, revolutions, and new political identities.
IF the dollar were to collapse, that would affect the global economy in an unprecedented way, in addition to shaking the foundations of governments around the world. This will cause for a major crisis of confidence in governments with having people opt to accept a cryptocurrency over fiat. This will exacerbate the dollars collapse, and that of other major currencies around the world. 
In other words, cryptos will rise to take the place of the collapsing state.

I wrote [this article]( explaining how deflation works with bitcoin. 
TL;DR: Bitcoin deflates like a stock NOT a currency, which is supported by the increase in the velocity of money
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:28:55
I'll take a crack at this.
Bitcoin has a fixed supply, means that the only way that the price itself can adjust itself is through transactions, as we cannot just create new bitcoins out of nothing. 
This is why if you look over the course of the last several bubbles, volume is always higher as the price increases rapidly, or drops rapidly. This is because the market is attempting to find a new equilibrium price, so transactions must occur to try to find that new price.
The longer that we sit at a stable price the more and more the volume will decrease, as everyone is coming to an agreement on what the 'real' price is. That is until the price breaks out of the stabilized trend, and then we play the game of finding the 'real' price all over again. 
TL;DR: Low volume is an indication of stability, and also what occurs before we go into the next bubble cycle.

There are alt-coins that use proof-of-stake in order to counter act the monopolization of bitcoin mining--not quite an answer for bitcoin, but its a start. Also,as time goes on, mining will become less and less lucrative, and the value of bitcoin will be more about network access.


Your logic sounds circular here. Bitcoin does have value--its access to the network itself. Because of the limited supply, there is only so much 'bandwith' per say, and that is the number of coins in supply. 
Furthermore, being able to securely transact with someone on the otherside of the planet in under an hour is worth a lot. And I'm not the only one that thinks that.

I'm paid in bitcoin and for lack of a better word, I also live 'paycheck-to-paycheck' because my savings are in bitcoin. 
This actually works out pretty well for me because of the auto-cash out mechanism. If the market sentiment is good, I'll only cash out for rent and essentials, and hold to cash out when the market is up 5 or 10%. If the sentiment has been down, as it has been recently, I sell all of my coins for fiat. 
I do understand that this is only because I'm paid in bitcoin, I see how it is more difficult if you are not.

He is right, and that is why Bitcoin is better. Even with the government's guns, violence, and disrespect for human rights and privacy, they can never steal from me, or any other bitcoiners ever again. I believe in the protection that math can offer me, not men with guns. This is because I know that these men of government seek to be good masters--but they seek to be our masters.

I'm slowly working on the development of [a theory of bitcoin]( There is much to be done, but if I could reduce it down to a few sentences:
Digital currencies, because of the cryptography they are built upon, and the real economic power that they command, creates new realm of power that has never existed before: The Digital Sovereign 
Because of the total functions of this new sovereignty (social, political, legal, economic) a new theory must be build out that can explain the concept of sovereignty, purged and stripped of its violent praxis from which the law today stands.

This is about egoism, envy, and the disempowerment myth. 
Way back in collage I worked as a dating coach; I helped guys meet women. It was just a skillset that any guy could learn (technology); but it was personally difficulty for many guys to muster the courage to attempt to learn it. It was easier for them to stay in their little world, and bemoan the fact that 'girls don't like them'.
Needless to say, what could I tell them that could change that? They thought that all women didn't like them, and rather than ask for help, it was easier to attack what I was doing. 
This is the same for the business I am in now. Everyone called me insane for putting $10,000 in bitcoin in the double-digits. That was a risk I chose and they did not. Now as we both look at the rewards of what we have got over the past few years they must find a good reason for why they aren't part of it too.

Taleb's black swan theory explains the rise of bitcoin, and what I think one day will be seen as the digitizing of money. Five years ago no one saw that coming except for Satoshi and many a handful of others. 
Furthermore his latest book (which I have not read) on antifragle systems seems directly applicable to bitcoin. Here is a [lecture on the topic by him on the topic]( At 8:30 he talks about convectivity, which it sounds like applies to bitcoin (bitcoin's volatility creates positive-sum economic exchange).

This isn't just a personal objection--there simply is no way to tell *without reasonable doubt* if someone has bitcoin and are using it. Sure you can tax at the point of sale (which I think would be a logical way to go about it, if at all), but otherwise, you cannot prove or disprove if someone controls a wallet.
My objection to regulation is that this is a slippery slope that quickly leads to a world where we have no right to privacy, and the 5th Amendment worth less than the paper it is wrote on. 
Finally, what right does this government have to my wealth?
They use our tax dollars to illegally fund wars and kill innocent people across the globe. The violate the very constitution that they claim gives them a right to rule over us. So long as this government has anointed themselves the purveyors of death, architects of tyranny, and superior to the US Constitution itself, I will not give them any of my money, and I will do my damnedest to make sure no one else does either.

The price of each coin is pretty unrelated to the payments that it can do. Bitcoin can allow for payments between currencies to be frictionless. That's one of the awesome things about bitcoin--the Network can be used to facilitate payments, which is not related the the price of bitcoin.

I'm going to do my best to retort your questions below.
1) Why? As a consumer, sometimes you cannot pay with a CC or PayPal because you cannot access those type of accounts, or the buyer cannot accept those methods. Bitcoin has a much lower barrier to entry (you just need internet access). 
Furthermore, as a buyer, there are some benefits to spending with bitcoin over fiat: 
A) You can use bitcoin directly, which helps support grow the bitcoin ecosystem. 
B) You do not have to convert your bitcoin, which is a factor for miners, early adopters, bitcoin merchants, and those that are paid in bitcoin. 
C) You can utilize your own personal time-preference in relation to the price per dollars to immediately get the results of that transaction (as in you do not know what the price will be in 20 minutes, so you would rather spend now at what you perceive to be a good price, or you just need to but that object immediately). 
For a general consumer who wants to buy something online from a reputable retailer what problem is BTC attempting to solve?
International transactions, [read this](
2) Some of us really need the anonymity BTC provides. Think about all of the privacy concerns with illegal government spying--I know that some people don't care, but that is deeply concerning to me, and I feel like bitcoin is one way I can combat that.  Also we don't know where the world will be in the year 2020 and we may very well need the privacy that bitcoin can provide. And once you know how to use bitcoin, it is safer and more convenient than using a credit card, and all of the fraud that can occur from merchants mishandling your private data.
3) Security issues really come from negligent use. Furthermore I feel more confident that I can move $50,000 worth of bitcoin in a transaction than I can move $50,000 with my bank. 
4) This is really a discussion about money. The difference between bitcoin and WOW gold is that bitcoin has real utility--nope is fucking with the monetary system of bitcoin, nor could they. Both dollars and WOW gold can be created willy-nilly at the will of central authorities beholden to no democracy. Bitcoin does. 
5) This is really much more of a political discussion that I would be happy to delve into, but for here I will keep it short. I think Bitcoiners really are a new political identity, and its a powerful one. It's one that encompasses the freedom of speech and information, and the right to the total ownership of ones labor, and the right to privacy. This is an identity that directly challenges the state by implicitly rejecting the fiat monetary system and those who control it.

The vast majority of my money is in bitcoin, and I am also paid in bitcoin. I prefer this over fiat, because I do most of my shopping online, which I usually get some discount using bitcoin, even if it is just gyft points. 
I also find this forces me to try to get more merchants to adopt because I don't want to go through the pain of converting back to fiat just to buy something.

I think Satoshi really understood what he was doing and was afraid that doing this would be illegal. Now getting a fake ID and buying a website *is* illegal. Using your real name that you have not used for nearly 50 year, and no one knows you by is NOT illegal.
Satoshi sounds paranoid as hell (for good reason) and this IMHO is the most profound way to throw people off. Security through obscurity is a principal of [steganography]( and to me it very much makes sense to hide in the open like this. 
Encryption is not for evasion, it is for privacy. Something that anyway about it, is being profoundly violated of this man. It saddens me to think what is to come in the following days.

I would like to comment on 
The power of what bitcoin can and will do is far from being realized. I personally think that there have been few technological developments as powerful as this one. 
Politically a totally independent money that the state CANNOT force one to part with via taxation is extraordinary. Due to bitcoin's intangible nature, one can cross boarders with millions of dollars in nothing but one's own mind (brainwallet).
I believe that the intangible nature of bitcoin is what implicitly allows for the separation of violence and money--something that the State cannot exist without.

Bitcoin is a technology, not just the network itself. That is why if you were to stop out bitcoin, you would also need to stomp out litecoin, and peercoin, and namecoin, and on and on.
Bitcoin has birthed hundreds of replicas that may not be mainstream, but if bitcoin were attacked people could simply switch to an alternative. The likelihood of governments then playing a wack-a-mole with attacking different altcoins just seems far-fetched, and self-defeating.

Local bitcoins of course. I would think because one would be changing that hard cash into bitcoin consistently, one would maybe want to have some kind of relationship with a local miner. That may be implausible though.  
More likely is the economic incentive route. If a dispensary were to offer a discount for paying with bitcoin, they would more likely get people paying with bitcoin over cash. Furthermore, a dispensary would be a great place to introduce people to bitcoin and what it does for a dispensary.

You open a huge issue that is a central thesis to my overarching philosophy.
Capitalism and the State are two twin forces that work pretty well when checking each other. However the centralize of power that started around a century ago fused the state into something else: Fascism. Today we have a hidden version of called [inverted totalitarianism](
Because of the infusion of violence for the capitalist into the legal system, we now have a very distorted and antihuman conception of capitalism. A key reason for the preposterous amount of money we spend on 'defense spending' i.e. The War Machine. 
Somehow, our crypto forefather's knew that the decentralization of the internet paired with an economy currency sovereign to no state would be revolutionary. 
Cryptocurrencies shatter the bond between money and explicit violence through removing physicality. I believe this can mostly cleanses capitalism of its violence, however this could take decades.

Don't link paywalled content unless you're gonna leave it in the comments. With that:


If you were to ask what is the immediate economic importance of the artificial internet currency itself, then there is indeed really not much to say. Bitcoin is not macroeconomically relevant, and never will be. This explains why economists show so little interest. The entire stock of Bitcoins was worth less than $7bn last Friday. The monetary base of the US is $4tn.




If that were to happen, it would be an act of huge macroeconomic, indeed geopolitical significance. Whether such a change would be benign, or not, is another matter. It would depend on the circumstances in which the challenge occurs and the features of the new money itself.




These advantages are important but possibly ephemeral. The current system exists only because society decided that the previous one did not work. It was the accumulation of financial crises in industrial societies that brought us the fiat-currency issuing monopolistic central bank.






If global instability persists it will produce more crises. Whether the next Bitcoin or its successors can succeed is impossible to forecast. But the environment is one in which an alternative decentralised system could flourish.
For those running such a system and especially those who advocate its development into a global monetary unit, it would be a good idea to develop at least a cursory interest in monetary economics. I suspect the challenge for the economics profession would incomparably larger.

Through being not a man, but a myth--nothing more than a ghost in the machine--could he become the legend that he is starting to become, and will become more of with the less he says.
The revolution of bitcoin is about much more than just money; it is about the myth of people rising up and uniting behind a digital money to throw off the yoke of tyrannical governments around the world. No man can do that; only a legend.

You forget about all of the auxiliary cost of fiat money. 
How much do we spend on law enforcement and the legal cost to enforce contracts? How much do we spend creating physical cash? How much cash is counterfeit, and what is the cost of that to the real economy? How do you account for the decrease in purchasing power due to inflation? What about the 10+ countries with +10% annual inflation?
It is not so simple just to look at the direct cost of transactions, as you need to remember that there is a whole expensive system in place that that allows for the fiat system to work. Without paying for all of those cost, any fiat payment system would struggle to survive.

It seems that bitcoin is parallel to Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses in that bitcoin is also a declaration of independence. Bitcoin's 'declaration' is economic independence is both from the official money making of the state, and from the monopoly that banks have on the control of money.

The author doesn't understand bitcoin. 
His failure to see the relationship between the electrical cost of mining and how that secures the network, along with how the ownership of bitcoin units are controlled with private keys mean he oversees the importance of what bitcoin is really doing. 
He attacks transactions fees, but fails to look at solutions like the lightning network. Then he builds himself a nice straw man argument about bitcoin users bearing unreasonable internal and external transactions cost, and how this makes an untenable system.
What pisses me off is this part:
"For the Left, there is no reason to regret Bitcoin’s failure. Its critique of the monetary system is not our critique... Socialists understand that the state’s monetary architecture is designed to maintain the stability of a system marked by inequality and alienation, but is not itself the cause of those things."
Yes it is! Through the state's monopoly of the monetary system and legal privileges they give to banks, they directly engage in our exploitation. 
There is a powerful answer for the Left with bitcoin and crypto assets, and it is through destroying capitalism by killing money itself.

It's the prototype for a new kind of digital social contract. One that creates a commodity money and is powered by cryptosystem and the very real energy it takes to both mint units of bitcoin, and secure the system. 


And yet here you are advocating that my lot is better thrown in with Jeff Bezos and the fascist war-machine state than with Satoshi Nakamoto. The state and capitalism have fused into a single object--this potentiality for democracy to bring the beast to heel was liquidated long ago; capital reigns supreme and it is the state who makes sure we mind the master. 


Bitcoin is a commodity-money, but it is not apolitical. No money is apolitical. Even gold was and still is political, which is why there was the whole silver democrats movement in the late 19th century, and subsequently the creation of the federal reserve after the panic of 1907. This is not by the failure of gold as a commodity-money, but by the capturing of it and oligopolization of it through the banking system. The later failure we see of fractional banking systems around the world in the 1930s was also not the fault of gold as money, but the banking systems. 


Yes it is, and because you fail to see this as anything new, you also fail to see how a design like this can enable a totally new money system, and political agreements. Bitcoin is now just one of hundreds of projects built on blockchain technology, which all have various potentials as money, but more importantly social contracts. 


Real deflation in fractional reserve fiat money systems do hit the poor and working class the hardest. Bitcoin is not a fraction reserve money system, but a commodity-money. This same reason why monetary inflation would be a bad thing within the bitcoin ecosystem. Again, you don't seem to understand bitcoin as a money system so I can see why you would believe this is just a techie masquerade. Believe me, it is not. 


If we were going for just bitcoin, perhaps you would be right. But were not. There are now thousands of different crypto assets, all working towards the common goal of creating new forms of social and economic agreements.

At this point I'm going to just assume you are Beggs, as no one defends some else work so vigorously. 
Again, you are failing to see that bitcoin while is a commodity money, it is not just any kind of commodity money. The features that allow for bitcoin and other crypto assests to function over the internet with cryptography protecting it means that it is fundamentally a new kind of commodity-money. It functions on totally different economic axioms than classic commodity monies. 


We should be looking forward to using this technology to create our own inclusive economic and political syndicates; essentially anarcho-syndicalism via the internet. Through the expropriation of capital itself from the state, through the choice to abandon state fiat money and to use alternatives that are outside of their power, we destroy the very backbone of capitalism itself, while also creating the framework from which we can create a whole new form of politics leveraging the internet. 
It's pretty clear to me that you simply don't want to understand what this technology can do, and you just want to label it as some right-wing conspiracy. You seem to have made up your mind that it is bad, and that's fine, but stop acting like you know what you are talking about. This is a totally new piece of technology that is radically changing the world, and you are far from the first person to say that it is nothing new. They were wrong and so are you. 


Try googling bitcoin lightning network and see what you come up with.


The environmental cost are a concern and which is why there are other projects like Ethereum, Tezos, EOS, Decred, and many more which are all working on proof-of-stake systems, meaning they don't use electricity in the same way. There is good reason for the need for a proof-of-work system (the system that burns electrical energy to create bitcoin units), but I won't go into that now. [Here]( is a more detailed post discussing some of these points at length. 
Please feel free to skim my blog, you'll find the answers to most of your questions there. I will also make sure to post my response to this piece here when I'm finished with it.

Bitcoin takes back monetary sovereignty from the state and puts it back in the hands of citizens. And when you consider trilemma nations-states face, they are fucked.
There is no way you can have a sovereign monetary policy when bitcoin can get around any and all capital controls.

Actually, that's how the gold reserve act was enforced--you could hold it, thus it could, and was seized.  I was pointing to the [Streisand effect]( that such a restriction would have because it would be much too difficult to enforce the illegality of bitcoin


This is the big question of how? How could they forbid bitcoin? And if they could do it, why have they not done it? It's well known that you can buy all kinds of nefarious things with bitcoin, yet here it is, still being used.

This is one possible outcome--what I actually see is a possible outcome of how we see deflation in the tech industry. There will be a  increasing cost paid to develop new and better hardware, but the real value of bitcoin should also increasing. This creates a zero-sum game where whoever does not play will be forced into the market to get new coins.
This normally would not be an issue, but because of BTC fixed supply it will most likely be more expensive to buy coins on the open market 6 months in future than to mine them today. This is because, as a tech company, you used the utility of your current BTC value vs. the future value of BTC and decided that investing in mining would be create more profit than just holding BTC.
The Osborn Effect could occur, but this will just mean that people that have not top of the line miners will switch to a more profitable alt-coin that has a lower difficulty.
I believe that this is how we will have a world of competing digital currencies.

I agree with you in principal, but disagree with you in terms of the reality of the situation (at least for those that are in retirement or close to it today).
The elderly are a lost cause with bitcoin. They do not understand bitcoin and furthermore believe us to be the criminals that their benevolent government told them we were.

Couldn't one just develop a multi-alt-coin mixing device? something like BTC--&gt;LTC--&gt;NMC---BTC. Throw in however many times through would be needed to get them clean. It would take an hour for the different coin blocks to process and get back to BTC, but that could be a method perhaps? I don't think you would lose much on the market friction.

You also act as a personal bank for yourself with unbeatable interest rates. I'm buying a new desktop soon, and It would set me back at least +$1500, but because I'll buy it with coins from 6 months ago that I bought at $70 each, I now get a 50% discount. 
I then buy the same number of coins I spent  (at $150) hold them for several more months until I again get a 50% discount on something due to the increase in price of bitcoin. So sometime in 2014 when bitcoin hits $300 a coin, I'll happily spend my coins I bought at $150 :)

Simple economics: if you need to transfer $35,000 to Berlin from San Francisco I can do it faster, cheaper, more secure, and with less hoops than any money transmitter in the United States. 
What that offers cannot be overstated in a world where $500 billion dollars a year is spent on sending money around the world. I find it laughable that I work in finance, and as a private individual I can run circles around these institutions in terms of the movement of money.

Bitcoin isn't only for the wealthy--you can send someone 5 cents if you would like, and again, you are only going to pay a fraction of a cent even for doing that. And this is because bitcoin isn't about making profit, it's about facilitating commerce in the most efficient fashion.
Bitcoin can help all of us, especially those who are the most vulnerable. With bitcoin, a street vendor can keep their saving in their secured phone rather than in insecure wads of cash. Someone who has very little income can keep it stored securely and not have to be concerned with the taxes and fees that come from having a normal bank account.

That is pretty well established now if you just look at the bubbles and the velocity of bitcoin--but I do need to put together a good, statistically valid, academic quality argument presenting this. It is clear that the 'deflation death spiral' only happens with monopolies on currencies, OR when only a few commodity monies exist. You can see that bitcoin, by design, is meant to relieve deflationary pressures through market mechanisms. This is unique to bitcoin because it is also 100% liquid.

We did that. 
What do you think the drug war was?
@_date: 2013-08-06 19:14:33
This is a cool discussion.
Inflation and deflation are two sides of the same coin. When you experience deflation with a fiat currency (i.e. dollars) it's because the velocity of money has collapsed. 
So shit's going down and everyone is freaking out about the economy so no one spends any money. This causes for there to be upward demand pressure on the dollar, essentially increasing the value of each dollar because there are fewer of them floating around because everyone is 'hording' them because of economic fears of the future.
Now central banks can fuck with the velocity of money by making it worth more (constricting the money supply) or worth less (expanding the money supply). So a central bank will increase the money supply to create inflation to incentivized to spend.
Problem is that these idiots tend to expand the money supply too much in response to the velocity of money collapsing, and then they create inflation, or worse, hyperinflation.
furthermore, increasing the money supply does not resolve the issues that caused for the collapse of the velocity of money. By expanding the money supply the feds are saying, "Look, just spend the damn money and increase the aggregate demand in the economy, and we will all be better."
This is that it's just random spending--they could care less about what it is spent on, and only care that spending is just happening. Be it billions on war, or lining the pockets of fat cat politicians, aggregate demand just cares about spending, any spending. 
Anyways, so when we talk about inflation/deflation we also need to talk about the currency unit (dollars, gold, bitcoin) and how the money supply of those currency units work.

I handle the operations side of processing international wires, and doing customer support for 'technical issues' i.e. someone doesn't know how to change their cookie settings. 


No, there are not others that I work with that hold these beliefs. A lot of people see that the baking system is broken and unfair, but they kinda shrug at it and think, "whatcha gonna do?"


They don't understand bitcoin... it confuses them mostly. There is also hostility towards it, saying stupid things like it enables money laundering, and can be 'hacked' with ease. 
We actually shut down a large bitcoin service a few months back. I talked to the CFO about trying to stop it, but they were concerned with 'money laundering'.
Around the same time I sat down with the CEO to talk about 'technology and the future' he told me about some bullshit of making the 'branch of the future.' It's a fucking retarded idea and is going to lose us tens of millions of dollars, but because of the corporate culture here, I can't say that to the CEO--I just have to nod and agree.
For me, this is what animated the point that this industry was going to die a slow and horrible death. The CEO of a multi-billion dollar company is going with what his 'feelings' are in regards to technology, rather than getting experts on technology to tell him the way forward. Feedback is not welcomed and is a quick path towards getting fired. 
The biggest problem is culture. These people think that because they run the finance system that their ideas are right. They are so invested with their own ideas that they can't even see how wrong they are. So I'm just keeping my mouth shut and waiting for a bitcoin bank/exchange/service that needs someone experienced with international wires.

What we are seeing with digital currencies is the start of a shift from state-based currencies, to math-based currencies. digital currencies are superior in every way, with one critical Achilles heel: acceptance.
Whatever coin can get accepted the most widely shall win, and right now that looks like bitcoin. But this is a game that is in the very beginning, so really any coin could win, it just depends on which one will be the most widely accepted.  
This is what capitalism truly is. Markets and currencies that do not have masters or controllers except for the Free Hand of the market.

[Hyperinflation]( sets in.
If the dollar started losing say 10% of it's value monthly. Gold would be outlawed--again, and capital controls would be established, and the use of Bitcoin forbidden. 
Considering the state of the economy, the amount of quantitative easing that has been done, and the general failure of world governments to have deal with the 2008 financial crisis in any kind of meaningful way, this outcome I would say is likely.

Bitcoin is a political force in itself.
We are a syndicate with an inherently superior money to the fiat economy. When we recognize that *WE* control the bitcoin economy, and NOT the corrupt politicians from all of our various nations that we live in, that is when I think we will start organizing politically. 
When a bunch of crypto-anarchist recognize the political power of their digital money to be superior to the rest of the world, it gives me great hope that we will be able to beat back the demon of fascism that is rising once again.

It is going to be a long and hard fight, but we will win. Bitcoin is just better at being money--in all senses of the word. The issue is we have been living in a society of cowards, babysitters, and Suzzie Safties for the last 60 years and people are terrified of anything that isn't under the watchful eye of Big Brother. 
Furthermore, people have been inundated with the corrupt Fourth Estate telling them, "Bitcoin is bad, only drug dealers use it, blah, blah, blah." Not even thinking for one moment, who owns the media?
Combating ignorance will be hard, but when the next inevitable financial bubble comes along where people lose another 40% of their wealth, [and have the rest of it sezied by the banks that lost their money](
Bottom line: Their money sucks, their system is corrupt, and there is bound to be another crisis like in [1998]( [2001-2002]( or [2008]( When shit hits the fan, people will change their tune about bitcoin and they will want in.

You guys think not paying taxes amount to theft, think about this. If you paid taxed you funded the murder of innocents with flying death bots--and this is illegal according to U.S. Laws.
19% of the federal budget goes towards 'defense' spending. 
or how about the $11 billion spend to spy on you.
So by your logic, because we get these few benefits from the government, that they have the RIGHT to go kill people in other countries and spy on us? You are saying that simply because I live here that I should be thankful that my government forces me to pay taxes under penalty of prison so that they can spend $1 out of $5 of what I pay in taxes on 'defense' spending?
Fuck that. Murder is wrong. 
I believe in a society with all of the benefits that you stated (fire department, social lending, roads, etc.) but WITHOUT a government. I know, crazy idea that we could organize a society on our own without being threatened to be thrown in jail, but that's a world I want to believe in.

True, but most people are not going to keep $50,000 worth of gold lying around at their house. They are going to give it to a bank, and like in 1933 when the government declared gold illegal in the US, the banks handed over the gold they had to the fed. It's not like you could say tell your bank to say no for you--which brings us full-circle to why BTC is decentralized. The only person who can really be trusted with your money is YOU!
@_date: 2013-06-04 00:49:28
I also have had the same idea, but there are a few things to keep in mind.
A) Any nation with capital controls of any sort (meaning there are limits on the exchange of capital) generally did that so people can't flee the currency. You selling bitcoin would be just that--I can't imagine they would be cool with it.
B) You have to figure out how to get the dirhams into bitcoin or how to get the dirhams into something useful like an assets or bullion.
C) The Polisario Front would love the shit out of BTC.
D) The Moroccans are pretty cool with torture.
E) There is a shitload of money to be made helping people hedge against the  losses of their shit fiat currency, but there is also a lot of oppressive forces that don't want that to happen. With that being said, if you think you can move around a bunch of wealth without getting noticed, the world is your oyster! 
Good luck!

Cryptocurrencies are political first and foremost because no matter how much power governments may have, they cannot control them.

*crowd funded advertizing and publicity campaign against Butterfly Labs*
I'll get this show on the road. As this isn't my fight, I feel someone personal screwed by BFL should take it upon themselves to do this:
Your history will show that you have been personally wronged by Butterfly Labs.
You will be known on to some degree.
Start a reddit thread on that explains your idea to do a crowd-funded campaign against BFL's fraud.
I suggest going after BFL advertizing partners, and do a publicity campaign built around how they ripped you off, and lied to you for a year. Website, Adwords, etc. If you get more than you need start a Bitcoin Better Business Bureau and help tell the community about fraudsters. But I don't care, you figure out the best way to go after them.

It cost about 200 billion dollars a year for a cash economy--about $1,739 dollars per year, PER PERSON, to use cash. That is more than 10% of the annual income of the more than 15% of Americans living in poverty, hence why the poorest tend to be the unbanked as well.

The coins never run out per-say, rather new coins come into existence and then they trade hands again and again to create new commerce. this is called [the velocity of money]( So there will still be 21 million coins (minus the ones lost) in existence in 2141 the only difference is now there will be no new coins minted--the only way to get bitcoins will be through the buying and selling of them. 
Furthermore, this is what fundamentally makes bitcoin work from an economic standpoint. I know with absolute certainty that there will never be more than 21 million coins. No government, no hacker, no person can ever create or counterfeit new ones. This gives value because I know that, unlike the Zimbabwe currency, my wealth will never be inflated away with bitcoin.

Good Compliance:
I guess this is a good starting point. As fun as it is to say all of that, it's just a party motto. Compliance is just another word governmental domination. You can have a business as long as the government approves of it.
Good Government:
Well, the government is corrupt to its core. There is no debate to be had here, it's simply true.
Good Business:
Compliance could be good, but in the article here, he says himself that a potential national financial regulation are torpedoed by big finance lobbying. If compliance is such good business than why does the author of this article acknowledge that a national compliance would be better and lower the barrier to entry for people doing business in this field, yet that is prevented from happening. This sounds like the rhetoric that statist like to say 'helps' business while really choking them with regulation.

No, I was pretty sure you were progressive with defending the government. I don't think you have seen the tyranny this state has to offer. You see a benevolent state that has flaws, but it's OK in exchange for the 'safety' they offer you. Besides, you got to vote for TWO totally different people--that's democracy, right?
Have you spoke with children that have had their hand blown off by U.S. Landmines? Have you talked to crying mothers asking why their child was killed by a trigger-happy american? Have you had your family members robbed from you because they smoked a little weed and got caught? Have you had a police officer beat the shit out of you for being at a protest? 
I blame you progressives more than anyone else because of your cowardice. You know how fucked up and wrong this all is, yet here you are debating me about the benevolence of the state. How we need the state for rules. You call yourself progressive, yet the only 'progress' you want to offer me is the robbery of choice in weather or not I want to give money to the state.

Bitcoin appeals to me because 
It can be used anonymously...
No one should be able to access your financial records. Period. It is not the government or bankers business what you do with your money. If they want to know then they should get a warrant, NOT the current version where you are spied on without your knowledge. 
It can be used for illegal purposes...
Like funding a girls schools in Iran or sending money to family in Cuba. Both of these actions are illegal, yet most would struggle to tell me why doing either one of these things would be bad. This is the problem with labeling things as being 'illegal', most of it has short-sighted and stupid reasoning--people are just told something is bad, and then they must obey or be punished under the law.
It sticks it to The Man...
Why should I cooperate with this corrupt government? With bitcoin, I can keep my wealth away from the grubby hands of these corrupt pigs and fat cats. They tax you and then use that money to kill people 1/2 way around the world--I want nothing to do with a government like that.

Utility is subjective. It is impossible to tell you what it's 'real' utility of any item is--it is simply in the eyes of the holder. 
With that being said, bitcoin is unique in that it is a *friction-less currency*--something that has never existed before. If we analysis this from a game theory perspective, bitcoin will always win because the *transaction cost* shall **always** be lower than that of the same transaction done in fiat.

A government would simply need to treat bitcoins as a measure of accounting for fractional reserve banking purposes. Everyone would deposit their bitcoins and life would be hunky-dory for a while. Then one day there would be financial panic because it turns out the government's banking friends suck at what they do. So rather then letting these crappy banks die their needed death, the government would steal everyone's bitcoins, or sell them back to you at a fraction of their original value because it 'for the good of the economy' not to let the banks fail. The government then takes your expropriated bitcoins, and gives it to the very people who lost it in the first place.

@_date: 2013-05-22 00:01:05
True, but this is also working on the assumption that I'll convert, buy what I need to buy and convert back, or use all of my BTC. So how about if I bought say 5BTC last month at $100 each--so I spent $500. 
And lets say that--just like normal purchases--I was delayed in doing the transaction for many reasons and Today I bought my $500 item (I use Gyft). Now that I have completed the transaction I will still have ~0.8 BTC left--why?
Because my BTC GAINED value, due to its scarcity while my USD lost value--this is the function of both currencies over time. BTC gains value, USD losses value. 
This is why I keep all of my wealth stored in BTC, because the longer it is stored, the more likely it will be worth more than I bought it. Furthermore, I do not see the death of bitcoin happen--and if it lives, there will be a dramatic expansion of the BTC economy. And to fit all of that economy activity into the bitcoin economy we can't print more money, the value of BTC just must increase. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:17:25
Pretty sure that is what the price spike over the weekend was all about.
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:02:27
Why is it scary? I would think that a low volume with a average price near $100 would indicate that speculation about the price has essentially ended--bitcoin is worth about $100. Hence why more people are not buying or selling, because there has been an unofficial market agreement that this is what the new price is.

"Most of us do want to believe in that world. I personally would also like to believe in God. Sadly, I've seen no evidence in my lifetime to justify such beliefs on either front."
So then we give up? We don't try to build a better world or be the ones that do say 'Enough!'? We just continue down this path of an overarching state that seeks to be a good master, but still seeks to be our masters?
The United State's Declaration of Independence states,
"When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."
To me it is very, very clear this Government has far over reached the authority entitled to it under the laws of this land. I believe it is clear (particularly with the building of a police state that insist it can spy on me) that this government has no respect for State's Rights, for individual human rights, or even constitutional rights.

The disruptive effects of bitcoin and digital currencies has yet to be seen.
Here is the simple fact: Bitcoin and digital currency are magnitudes more efficient at banking and finance than the current version of fiat money. This is **FACT**
Today, there is no way you can transfer money internationally without facing high fees--that is of course, unless you are using bitcoin or other digital currencies.
Furthermore, inflation has robbed people of about 90% of the dollars purchasing power in the last century. Same thing for all other fiat currencies. Government of the world facilitated, created, and enforce inflation which makes you (as average joe) poorer.
Finally, when the next financial crisis hits (3 to 9 months from what I can see) the markets will panic, credit will dry up, and there is going to be a lot of money looking for somewhere safe--bitcoin can provide shelter from the shitty global financial system. As the markets are panicing and some one  is going to move a lot of money into bitcoin, and the value will be driven up while the global markets are moving down.
And this is not to mention the endemic levels of corruption in finance, nor the corruption that haunts governments around the world. 
Money and commerce is about to radically change--the question is just when will we hit the tipping point.
@_date: 2013-05-22 00:43:22
What you state is true, but I did not say that the value of BTC must increase for no reason. I was stating more that IF the economy of BTC is to expand (such as taking over say 1% of the Ecommerce market) THEN the value must go up. This is because unlike other money, bitcoin cannot be created on demand--therefore, IF the economy of BTC is expanding THEN the value of each bitcoin must increase to compensate for the new value that is being added. 
With BTC being similar to gold, it is going to be a crapshoot for the shorter amounts of time. for example, the price of gold dropped quite a bit over the course of the last few weeks. But since 2001, it's gone up more than 500%. 
So ask yourself, if you have savings of $1000 today would it be worth more if you put it in a great 12-month CD that gave you 10% gains (So you get $1100 in May 2014) OR do you buy 9BTC today, and delivered to yourself in May 2014? Which one will be worth more?
I personally would go for the BTC, because I think it will absolutly be worth more than $1100 in May 2014. I hope that all made sense....

Yes, but that is part of what makes this model work. One would use the fixed supply of bitcoin and its increase in purchasing power over a time-span against a fiat currencies lost of purchasing power over the same time span.

Yep. This is where the real money is to be made, ironically from liberating some of the poorest people in the world from the monetary chains that enslave them. People seem to forget that freedom is very, very valuable, and the simple fact is that Kipochi can free Kenyans from both usurious fees from reminiscence, and the crushing destruction that results from inflation. 
The result is Kenyans have a money that allows for them to circumnavigate remittance fees, inflation, and banking fees. 
And for all of the naysayer, remember that M-PESA which now facilitates about 30% of all commerce and 4 out of 5 Kenyans use, was only started in 2008--so don't think that radical growth cannot happen.

Refusal and disengagement from the traditional banking system is one of the most powerful things normal people can do to help rejuvenate their democracy. 
With that being said, there is nothing you can do to convince people otherwise. We can list every fact from here to next week about why bitcoin and digital currency systems are superior to fiat, and it will not matter. People need to learn on their own that they are poor, broke, and oppressed by the systems that they feed. 
People need to make a *choice* about the future they want to have. If they want a bank that controls their money, steals from them, sells their privacy, and refuses to help them in hard times, that is their business. If they want a money that is free from governmental control and spying, and allows for them to transfer funds around the globe for next to nothing, it is available for their use.
The markets will figure this out--it is simply a matter of time before everyone realize that the emperor has no clothes.

Why not just exchange it for the full amount and let that bill circulate? 
If you gave me a 0.1 BTC note, Why don't I just treat it as $12.74? Your widget cost $10.00 even, I take the note and the private key--that's mine now--and I give you the widget and $2.74 in USD back. 
In theory you are creating a promissory note equal to the value of one Bitcoin, because with the private key, you have access to the coin.

Bitcoin as a money and currency works great. Things could use some improving (like the hard wallet needs and security), but I am faithful that the market will provide these things.
IMHO, we are winning. Yes, we are winning against the governments, the media, the banking system, and everything that is trying to 'kill' bitcoin. BUT there is still much work to be done, specifically educating people on bitcoin, how it works, why they need it. The more educated people are, the more people that will adopt, and the more business will be willing to accept BTC.

Look, people are stupid. I work at a bank and people look at me like I'm nuts when I tell them I own bitcoin. People do not understand it, and so they reject it. My favorite conversation to have with anyone over 50 is to ask them about debit cards--what was it like when they first came out? Most tell me it was weird, uncomfortable, and didn't make sense.
Sound familiar?
Now what if I tell you I have a credit card that charges only .03% per transaction? And I'll get your money to you instantly--no waiting for days on end for your wire to go through. Don't worry about how it is done--that's my job.
Sound like a better deal? Because it is, and this is what bitcoin offers. 
People don't need to understand bitcoin, hell it's probably better for most of us that they don't. That's what we do. All they need to understand is that it works fast, better, and much cheaper than the current system.

Because you never convert back--at least if you are smart and would like to have something worth MORE money later than less. Holding Bit coin over dollar is a smart investment, and I see no reason why you would want to hold dollars over BTC.
Lets say I take out a loan for $2700 27 months ago. I hold that money as bitcoin and pay off my $100 dollar payments over the next 27 months--I ONLY convert the money when I pay the loan. If the currencies are the same than there should be no money left over, right?
Well 27 months ago was feb 2011, bitcoin touched 1$ for the first time, so lets say I bought 2700 bitcoin with that $2700. BTC gained close to 10,000% from when bought it in that time period vs. the USD being worth LESS now, today than when I got the $2700 back in feb 2011.

Rick also calculates the velocity incorrectly because he is treating the 11.4 million coins in existence as if they are all potentially being circulated. They are not, some are lost--those lost coins should not be factored into it. 
He also doesn't look at how much is locked up in the securities market and the values of those *assets*, such as Asic-miner, and that the shares are illiquid as bitcoin at the current point in time.
He also doesn't look at how many coins have been used to buy mining equipment, which influences the future price.

This is the start of a crackdown, but it's going to be a pretty laughable all around. I can already see the stupid look on some senator's face when asked why there needs to be a bill regulating 'digital monies'.

The morons in power are the architects of their own destruction, and I am going to happily laugh at them when they suddenly realize that they lost at this game of finance.
They tried to outlaw PGP in the 90's.

Both failed miserable because of the decentralized nature of them. And so will their attempts here will also fail simply because you cannot stop people from using it.

I think saying 'leftist' really loads up this interaction to be only two-side, when we all know that this issue is multifaceted. 
I think that government can be one of the most powerful and liberating institutions that man has ever built--with that being said, this is a far cry from what the U.S. Government of today is. Today, the government is little more than an extremist government dictated by two evil factions of red or blue and nothing else. Democracy means nothing when you only have a selection between two different failing parties for governance.
It's clear that no one is going to help us out of this predicament. Our government has made Whistle-blowers into terrorist, social justice organizers into criminals, and mere thoughts into crimes--there is no escape from tyranny at this point. We cannot escape it, but perhaps we can destroy it.
Bitcoin offers a future where, like Henry David Thoreau, we can refuse to pay taxes because of the innumerable illegal and immoral actions of the government. That's why I use bitcoin, because I never want another cent of my money to be used to buy bullets, spy programs, or fund prisons. 
And the government's fiat money is becoming more worthless by the day--so all I have to do is sit back and wait for these greedy idiots to destroy themselves. Liberty is coming, and it sure as hell isn't going to be coming from the government, it's going to come from stripping the government and their crony capitalist allies of the privilege and power that they have created for themselves and only themselves.

Please explain why you believe this to be true. Because as gold has a finite value, and it seems to still work as a commodity money. Furthermore, people seem to be buying and selling BTC today, which seems to negate your theory.


This seems to be one of the more powerful *features* of digital currencies. That seems to be what enables the silkroad to work, along with **private** transactions between two consenting parties. Furthermore, the government can try there best to strangle the liquidity out of BTC, but they are going to have a hell of a time. It's recognized as [money in Germany]( and many people don't want national governments attempting to regulate a transnational currency. 
As senseless as 'sticking two fingers up' to the powers that be, it's time that it happens. The men in government and their allies in megabanks are criminals. They have preformed unethical, immoral, and illegal behaviors that the government refuses to punish, or prosecute. Furthermore, their behavior puts the whole financial system as a whole at risk--it is clear these people should not be in control of the supply of money, nor do they have any right to tell me what to do with my moeny. 
I think you are right about bitcoin maybe not being the final answer to changing the global financial system, but I do think that both a fixed supply, and pseudo-anonymity are both features that any successful digital currency will have.

Yes, most money does not have intrinsic value--but that's one of the things that makes Bitcoin special. Bitcoin is in itself a technology that offers an advantage over all other monies, hence why it has value.
Bitcoin's value is derived from:
-Psudo-anonymity with financial transactions
-non-reversible transactions 
-fixed, predictable supply
-very, very low transaction fees
-non-governmental money
The value of governmental currencies come from the fact that it's the only currency you can use. This is also known as a monopoly. And by having a monopoly, governments have been able to force people to use their money while they have been devaluing it (QE), and also giving it to their friends through tax subsidiaries, fraud, and general corruption. 
The problem is that monopolies are very inefficient. And when fiat currencies are forced to compete with digital currencies that are math-based, they will lose. There are two simple point to highlight this:
**1. Over time (think years, decades) fiat currencies will always lose purchasing power.**
**2. Bitcoin will ALWAYS be more efficient to move internationally, and digitally.**
To this day, I still have not heard one single economist state that bitcoin is more inefficient than fiat currencies. And the free market is all about efficiency, and crushing those that are inefficient through market mechanisms. And the simple fact is that fiat money is much, much more inefficient than digital currencies, and that is why fiat currencies will die: They are an outdated model for century that has passed.

This is best explained as a story:
It is three years ago in 2010. I am a loan shark of the shadiest kind. You are young, poor college student who sees the potential of bitcoin. You want to start a mining farm--you want $10,000 worth of GPUs for mining. You want this money today, as there is a 50% off sale. You come to me asking for this loan. 
LT: Hey Noel20, I need to borrow $10,000.
N2: Mmm, I don't know, you're from the internet
LT: But look, I put up these bitcoins as collateral--200,000 BTC! (You had these from…somewhere, and it was hard to exchange back then)
N2: Well, Ok, but the loan is going to be paid back in $$$! At 10% interest!
LT: Ok that's fine. 
N2: And if you default I keep your 'Funny money'. Bit--what?
LT: Bitcoin, internet money, other people will exchange sometime in the future if I default--I won't though.
N2: We'll it's mine if you do! And I'll most likely hurt you in some fashion too. 
So your first payment to me will be $336 starting October 20, 2010--Don't be late!
LT: Sure thing!
N2: What did you need this for?
LT: Not that it's any of your god-damn business, but for computer equipment, graphics cards….
*over the next three years you regular make your payments. I laugh all the way to the bank, thinking I took advantage of you charging 10% interest, an extra $1500 over the course of 3 years. Little do I know that you bought yourself a mining farm back in 2010.*
*Upon making your final payment*:
LT: Ok, here is your last payment! Thank you so much for lending to me. I really needed those $10,000 to invest back in 2010--it paid off very well. 
N2: Cool, so I heard more about these bitcoins--these are worth a lot now, huh?
LT: Oh yeah, 26 million USD now.
N2: Wow. As amazing as it is, I would have never guessed that 3 years ago when giving you the loan. Anyways, I kinda feel bad for taking you at 10% interest when the Fed is just giving money away right now. I'm sorry. 
LT: No! No, it's totally fine, I was from the internet, you didn't know me, etc. I get it. Plus, I really needed that $10,000 to invest in bitcoin mining equipment--it paid off.
N2: We'll I'm happy for you. I don't understand this stuff--cold hard cash is good for me. But if you need another loan, you can use those *bitcoins* as collateral again at say, 50%.
LT: Really!? 50 million! I could build [*fill in revolutionary technology that you can use 50 million USD on*]!
N2: Um, whatever. I'll just keep the bitcoins as collateral. Only 5% this time, say over 5 years...
TL;DR: You got $10,000 in sept. 2010. I got $11,500 over the course of 3 years. You won because you invested. I won because I lend money when I was not using it. We both used our subjective utility to make decisions that made us the most wealth we could.  Win-win.
@_date: 2013-09-18 16:13:56
I have quite a bit tied up in mining operations too. I did my research and I think that a $200 bitcoin is not too far off--if I'm right than these investments will be well worth it.

Lobbying I think is too dirty. I don't think we should associate with such scum or display our willingness to work with them. The corrupt will find a way to manipulate, divide, and hurt this community--we do not want that.
With that being said, I think that there should be a business development fund. Sponsored by miners or large business in the BTC community, the ONLY job of this fund would be to get more business accepting Bitcoin. 
Imagine if someone like one of us had the sole job of just getting people to use bitcoin. Explaining the benefits, why it's good for savings, how the transactions are faster than with a bank, the saving on foreign transaction fees, helping them setup wallets and understand how to use BTC, etc. THAT would be a hell of a lobby, and we wouldn't have to dirty our hands working with the scum that's in Washington.

If you have $100,000 in debt today, and there was a total deflation of 10% in one year, you would now owe closer to $110,000 in real debt. Deflation is bad for debtor, good for creditors. In the same way, if you had $100,000 and kept it in a safe, that same money would now also be closer to being worth $110,000. Inflation is good for debt, bad for credit. Deflation is bad for debt, good for credit.

Hmmm... an item in limited supply, maybe gold?
I think my argument was missed. The point is that bitcoin cannot be outlawed because 'money' (i.e. the thing we give value for exchange) is just an idea. And this idea has attached itself to BitCoin considering I can go buy all kinds of thing with it right now--including USD. 
Governments can outlaw cryptocurrencies all they want because economics is not about the law--it is about economics. And Bitcoin is simply much, much more efficient as a money to do exchanges in the digital world of today BECAUSE it can't be controlled. 
With bitcoin, I pay 0% taxes. 0% transaction fee (or damn near), and no exchange fees. The cost savings of something like that, with very little chance of getting caught (if you know how to use Tor) is just too great. 
The second largest economy isn't China--It the illegitimate economy. 10 trillion dollars a year world-wide is done 'off the books'. And bitcoin is going to make that a hell of a lot easier. And consider that System D is growing faster than the 'legitimate' economy, I think bitcoin has a bright future. 
There is no difference between a legitimate business and an illegitimate one, other than what the government tells you.

Ok, the deflation argument is deeply flawed and goes to show that people are simply parroting economist like Krugman. 
Deflation is a very serious issue when you are working with **Debt-based money** and **single currency economies**. Bitcoin is not debt-based, nor is it in a vacuum where other currencies are not available. Thus the HUGE issue with deflation is that it increases the real value of debt... which the bitcoin economy has very, very little of. 
Furthermore, the deflationary pressure of bitcoin can always relieve itself through market mechanizes of selling bitcoin which will force the equalization of the market.

Yes they do *if* you find a chunk of gold at the bottom. But that is the risk, right? The holes are worthless, but what you can find in them can yield you much more than the cost of the energy expended on finding the gold.
This is like mining for solo blocks. Looking for your own block in and of it self cost energy. You may never find a block, but you were still spending energy trying to find one--similar to digging the hole to find gold, that has to be rolled into the cost of production of bitcoins.  
Being scares is a feature that helps support the price, but why would anyone pay $120 for one coin if they could just mine it themselves for next to free?
That is why the energy needed to produce a bitcoin does factor into the price.

I'd disagree because the market simply needs competition to create contrast, diversification, and insurance. You can only see that the alt-coins are copies of bitcoin by comparing the alt-coins against bitcoin. Furthermore, extreme centralization might happen, governmental attacks, or anything that could cause for the collapse of bitcoin (unlikely, though possible)--in which case, an alt-coin could rise to take the place of bitcoin.
Also the destruction of shitty alt-coins helps reinforce that bitcoin **is** the primary digital currency.

Ugh, really? How short sighted can you be?
You can have your Paypal account shutdown whenever without reason. If you use a credit card you will pay at least 3% more than your purchase because of the financial transaction fees. If you are a merchant and take credit cards, you can get hit with charge backs. IF you are trying to purchase anything over $3,500 online with a debit card you MUST tell your bank if you don't want the charge denied. 
And if Bitcoin "duplicates a process that already exists" than please explain to me how I can purchase items online, anonymously, without my financial transaction being monitored?
And yes, "You can already buy shit online and it's easier to pay with PayPal or credit card than it is to use BTC." But guess what? You will always pay more for the same items as I do because you really want to give that extra 3% to paypal and your credit card company. 
Furthermore, if we were both running an international business, guess what? You get to pay the 3% fee, PLUS another 1% transaction fee and shit exchange rates. You are going to get fucked out of 5% of your total profits because BTC scares you.
So please, keep using Paypal and keeping being happy about paying those extra fees, and knowing that everything you ever buy online is monitored by your bank.

As much as I desperately want bitcoin to be successful, this is a very, very, very large enemy to have. 
We neglect that we are talking about breaking the century long monopoly on currency.
We are threatening national government with their ability to tax, and we are threatening the very architecture of the global financial system itself.

This is one of the keys that makes bitcoin so powerful. You are now allowed to send money to your family in mexico using BTC, and you do not have to pay a $35 fee, nor do you have to pay the 1% conversion fee.
If you wanted to send $5,000 all you need to do is buy $5,000 worth of bitcoin (coinbase, bitstamp, etc.),  then once you have your 40BTC, send that to your family. They can then cash out the 40BTC as peso, and use that money as they need. :D
@_date: 2013-08-14 17:05:44
I want to clear the air about a few things. First, bitcoin is not money--at least not in the sense that people think of it today--so applying The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money to this simply doesn't work. Because of bitcoins fixed supply and the resources that are needed to mine bitcoin means you need to look at bitcoin as a commodity, rather than a money. Just so happens it works better than money that we have today.
The deflation argument only makes sense in the context of having a single currency, and debt in that single currency--not multiple. It is impossible for bitcoin to enter into a deflationary spiral when it has liquidity into other currencies. So if a 'death spiral' were to start, that would just mean most of us would cash out--thus ending the spiral. This is because we need to understand that bitcoin is working as a [competitive currency]( who's value comes from the market--no where else.
Finally, the mortgage argument is stupid. Bitcoin is not a debt-based currency or economy, so taking out mortgage with bitcoin is stupid and anyone would would do one clearly would not understand how bitcoin, or a mortgage for that mater works.

I read the paper. They called Liberty Reserve, Liberty Exchange... oh boy.
They really missed the boat on this, spending the majority of the paper talking about Facebook credits and amazon coin--which they concluded would not be a threat to the state (shocking!).
As for what they say about bitcoin, I think they actually have  no idea how it works: 


currency that interacts with state currencies poses no risks, **since such money creation is at a low level.**"
To me this indicates that they have no idea how the liquidity or divisibility of bitcoin works. 


hence the impact on any one state currency is negligible.**"
To me this really indicates they have no idea what they are screwing with. The fact that the users are geographic dispersed is what makes it *more of a threat*, not less. If it means that I can convert to any currency, why would I hold a shit local currency like Venezuelan Bolívar, are Argentina Peso, both which have above 10% inflation? Why not just keep bitcoins, or convert to another currency that is not inflating as fast?
The paper concludes with making a poor comparison to the free banking era of the U.S., and how multiple currencies would create inefficiency in the markets (which is completely wrong for a number of reason).
Good insight to how little Statist understand what is going on.

See, even you admit that it has a future as a shadow currency. And guess what, the shadow economy is the second largest economy in the world, at about 10 trillion dollars a year.
This is a segment of the market that has never been served by banks because they tend to be poor, isolated, or just plain undesirable customers. And with the advent of Bitcoin and other payment schemes, this economy suddenly has a whole new way of doing business. Keep in mind that this is a part of the economy that has always done business illegally--all that bitcoin does it make it easier, quicker, and more efficient to do business. 
I do agree with you that government do not want this currency around, but what can they do about it? Ban it? That just show how much of a threat it is. And yes, the credit card company will fight it, so will legislators, but the question is will we let them win?
And the reason people will accept it even when it is illegal is the same reason that people have accepted gold when it was illegal--because its value compared to the fiat currency will continue to rise. 
Finally, government oppression is never a good reason for something not to work. To me, bitcoin is about liberty. Not the bullshit liberty that the idiots tout, but real, true, liberty. I am sick of having Gods and Masters, and bitcoin can be the answer to that.

The liquidity trap is what bankers and economist tell people when they are confused about the effects of monopolism in the market. Big banks take the money from the Fed expanding the money supply, put it in their pocket and then say, "The economy is still bad! We need more QE!" and then the government gives them more money.

This is an issue, but it is not different from getting your bank account hacked, and furthermore, is a great place for an entrepreneur to build value. A bitcoin bank that offers 100% insurance would be quite successful.

@_date: 2013-09-08 20:58:36
Exactly. I think of litecoin as total bitcoin insurance scheme. It's existence in and of itself renders any 51% attack useless. What's the point of spending all of that time and energy on a malicious attack when there is just another damn internet moneyz that will replace it?
I think if digital currencies become as successful as I hope they will be, litecoin will figure out someway to make its faster block production advantageous.

I work at a bank (sorry, I have to pay rent). You see, the banks seeks to be *good masters*--they wants to help you achieve your golds and dreams, *so long as it is done how the banks sees fit*. In other words, the bank wants to be a good master, *but it still wants to be your master*.
And you really do have no privacy. Nor do you have much for recourse if someone were to choose to shut down your accounts. Also, try to get more than $10,000 out of your own account today--it most likely won't happen.

This is a market where anyone can trade. That means that there are going to be lots of inexperienced, emotional, ill-thought out trades. That's not necessarily bad, but it is going to make bitcoin faces some serious growing pains.
I think for a while we are going to be on this roller coasters--maybe a few months, maybe a few years--but eventually, I think the volume of speculation will decrease, and more real commerce will occur. When that does happen, the volatility should decrees, in addition to BTC gaining slowly against FIAT.  
I think about bitcoin in the long-term--like year 2017 or 2020. With a fixed supply, and people scrambling to start making very, very profitable hedges on ForEx using bitcoin, I struggle to see how the economic incentives wouldn't make bitcoin successful.
Granted, getting to BTC broad acceptance will be hard, and I have no idea how it happens, but here's where I am biased:
**Banking is very, very expensive--trading ForEx is even more expensive. Bitcoin cuts those cost to almost 0. How can banks compete with that?**
It's about the simple economics. 
Bitcoin is much more affordable to do financial transactions than a bank. 
Although these speculative fluxs in price can hurt, I don't see how it affect the totality of bitcoins's utility--that primary being that it **cuts transaction cost down dramatically, and there is a fixed supply**, so the playing field is much more level than in the global financial system.
@_date: 2013-05-24 23:50:40

Ah, so because the state has given me these 'protections' I am to be grateful that they tell me what drugs are 'good', what food is 'good', and what history is 'good'. Furthermore, because I was 'given' all of these nice 'protections' I should be complacent with all of the money that is spent on prisons, police, oppression, and murder (defense spending is about 19% of the federal budget).
What I understand is that the government's monopoly on money is what allows them to tax people and then redistribute that money according to what they see as 'correct'. And their version of 'correct' involves murdering innocent people, disrespected international human rights, and violating the very constitution they are sworn to protect.

Bitcoin *can* be a mode of exchange between currencies (USD --&gt; BTC --&gt; USD or EUR) but that just one of many features.
The storage of wealth is NOT from exchanging into dollars, but from the subjective value that people ascribe to bitcoin. For example if I want to buy a car, someone might charge me say 15 BTC today. That value is in bitcoin itself--it may be equal to about ~$10,000, but that is not what gives it value, the value is a figure choose between myself and whomever I may be purchasing an object from. In other words, bitcoin is a currency in itself, and converting it into fiat is something it can do, but that is not using it at it's most efficient. 
This is one of the 'features' in my mind--people will lose some % of their bitcoin *unless* they can convince a merchant to accept bitcoin, which is of benefit to all parties.
Finally, I work in banking and handle international wire transfers. These things take a long-time to complete, have tons of paperwork, and moves slow as molasses, and there are a shitload of countries you just can't send money to. Bitcoin gets around all of that.

The volatility is because the market is so small--only about $2 billion. So If I trade around say a million dollars buying and selling, that can swing the markets dramatically--this is unlike say, the forex market where you have to swing around hundreds of billions to see a flux in the price.
As the market expands...$3 billion...$6 billion....$10 billion.... the units of currency cannot. Therefore, if the market were to ever reach $10 billion dollars (Which is only 5% of all e-commerce--so quite viable), that means that the value of bitcoin must, MUST, increase 5x to have the value of $10 billion meaning that 1 BTC would be worth somewhere around $500 dollars.
As the market expands, the volatility will decrees due to the fact that it will take more, in this case 5x more USD or other fiat currencies to be poured into BTC to have the same effect of volatility as it does today. 
That's why you don't see gold swing +-10% of it's value. The market is too damn big for anyone person to do that, and it also has seasoned investors who don't panic and pull out the first moment that the value drops.
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:26:30

It is sickening and despicable to equate violence with these activities.

They seek to keep you under a financial monopoly so they can keep printing more money and giving to their friends while you become poorer. 
I understand that a world without minders and masters may terrify the cowardly and weak, but that is no excuse to sacrifice essential liberty for temporary safety--those who do deserve neither liberty, nor safety.

Yes, but this is a zero-sum game. Keeping your investment 'safe' when we are cranking out a new $4 billion dollars a month means that your 'safe' investment is going to have to figure out how to deal with all of that new money in the economy and having it dilute the purchasing power of your money.
Difference of opinion I suppose, but I think that it's crazy that people think that we will get to the year 2018 without another substantial global financial crisis. The difference this time is that the panic is going to be over the currency itself--people dumping dollars for something else while hyperinflation digs its nails in.

You pay taxes, correct? That means that you give the government money--money they can spend on whatever they want to. They spend that same money to buy drones that blow up children in Yemen. 
We are debating about weather or not the government controlling money--and thereby being able to taxing people--is appropriate.
I believe to have a complete conversation about that we need to talk about what the taxes are spent on. 
If taxes were being spent on puppies and warm-fuzzes, than yes you are right, government is good and lets all pay more taxes.
The issue is that the government use at least 19% of their budget for 'defense' which is another word for war spending. War is stupid, bad for business, and just an asshole move.
Therefore, to have a meaningful conversation about taxes and money, we need to talk about what those taxes and money is used for. Thing like blowing up children in Yemen.

I don't think it is so much about entrepreneurial opportunity, as it is a paradigm shift caused by technological innovation. Bitcoin simply makes the "old model" of banking and finance outdated--and we are all poised to benefit from that. 
I encounter people *don't even believe* that we have a secure form of P2P money that can go anywhere in the world--it's just too...different for them to handle. The way people will get mad with their disbelief when I tell them about it is amazing.

Ok, now we are getting somewhere! 
Now what person would by a $15,000 miner, and sell their coins at a loss? They had the $15,000 to start with, so I wouldn't think they would need to sell below the price that it costed them to mine. Thus, if they do not sell, they are restricting the supply, and that in turn can incress the price.
Being the controller of the coins and being self-interested, it would make no sense for someone to sell at a loss unless they were panicked and thought there was going to be a total collapse of the price.
Similar to you and your fist diamond. Perhaps no one would buy it from you at 1 million and you would have to sell. Or perhaps you are a wealthy man, and you would rather hold it off the market until the price does reach 1 million, even if it never does. 
So I see what you are saying that the price it is sold at is what matters, but I do think that the amount of energy and investment spent on mine does influence the overall price because of that 'indirect' method you mentioned above.

Pretty sure that this is part of their business model so I see no reason why they would disclose how their pricing works. 
I think of Coinbase much more a bank, so if there is a shortage, it makes sense that they would push both the buy and sell prices up to incentivize selling to them so that they could pass-through those coins to customers who are willing to buy at a higher price.
Now that they have passed Gox, anyone who was trying to arbitrage between gox and stamp can now do that through Coinbase. Thus, they can take people away from Gox.

I guess this is the fundamental argument that Bitcoin allows--I believe that bitcoins economic value is dramatically undervalued. Take into consideration that there will only be 21 million ever--and we have to think about the longterm--what will bitcoin be in 2020? Why shouldn't it effectively destroys the remittance industry. 
That's 401 Billion. That along with Ecommerce at more than a trillion. And it's not like converting over to bitcoin is difficult. Or beneficial. or most particularly--free.
But alas, you are right a lot of the value may be from speculation. But you can't close Pandora's box. And I really do think that Bitcoin is the Pandora's box of the financial world. And as more and more real transactions are going to be done in bitcoin, I think we will see a stabilizing of the price.

Market fundamentals.
Bitcoin what Hayak spoke of in the [The Denationalization of Money]( book that explains how 'Free Money' would have to compete against one another for acceptance. I believe bitcoin (and to some extent the alt-coins) to be what Hayek spoke of. 
I also know how incredible inefficient the banking system is, how horrible and likely inflation is, and how corrupt our monetary system is. To top all of this off, the USD is what my government uses to tax me and thus fund wars. Using an alternative currency can help keep my money away from their corrupt deeds. 
There are thousands hacking at the branches of evil in all sorts of ways--political struggles, demonstrations, petitions, strikes, walk outs--all kinds of things. And what does it earn us? Simply look at social, economic, and political conditions. For every social gain that is made, one is robbed from us--it's helpless because of corruption. But to strike at the root of evil--money--now that, that just might do something. 
TD;LR I believe in bitcoin economically, philosophically, and socially--it's simply a matter of time before the markets, entrepreneurs, and people make bitcoin successful.

It depends on what school of economics you come from. Many contemporary economist 'don't believe' in bitcoin (because it is not government-backed), so they say it can't be money. Keep in mind that these are the same fucktards that said they were going to fix the economy in 2008.

You want to get rich? Build the AOL of bitcoin. Or even better, build a bank.
People don't need to know how bitcoin works--they just need to know that if they use the bitcoin bank, they can send money anywhere in the world for $1, and this bank has CDs rates for 4% APY. People don't need to know shit about bitcoin for that to be a totally viable model. 
My dream is to run a bank with very, very low fees, and high rates of return by essentially shorting the dollar using long-term balloon loans for capital. Reinvest and focus solely on getting to the unbanked and educating them to see that fiat currencies are garbage for a storage of wealth.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:08:58
Yes, in the short run this is a great risk to the price--in the long run, I cannot imagine a better scenario. If the authorities believe BitCoin to be enough of a threat to shut down bank exchange accounts, that means that the currency is becoming successful. Why else would they shut it down?
And what I love about this is there is not a goddamn thing that the feds and other authorities can do. And the more they try to stomp out the currency, the more they will fail, the more media attention is given to BitCoin, and the more interested people will become, and the higher the price goes.
Look at the long game. They are scared, if they weren't they would leave us alone, they wouldn't talk so much crap about how 'Bitcoin isn't a real currency', and economist wouldn't be so confused about it. And as in class economics, if you outlaw (or start punishing) bitcoiners for holding bitcoin, you create artificial scarcity, thus causing a rise in price.
There's good reason that weed cost $100s per ounce--it's because it's illegal, not because it's rare.
So I say bring it on. Ban the exchanges! Outlaw all cryptocurrencies! Punish business that take Bitcoin! Because in the end, there isn't jack shit that is going to stop this. The more the authorities try, the quicker they will ensure their own demise by showing how resilient and power the currency is.

I'll have to disagree because it is through the totality of what you said that the we can find the true cost of money:


This is called [seigniorage]( It is a type of hidden tax that is put into the cost of fiat money. This means that overtime, the governments pays for the monitoring, printing, replacing, and enforcing of the cash economy through inflation. This is why the [dollar today has 96% less purchasing power than it did 100 years ago](

Arg, it enrages me when people assert economic theories as being truths when they are anything but. Deflation can be a terrible problem and has been before such as in the great depression, but this must be understood as an economic function of the collapse of the [velocity of money]( NOT deflation itself. 
As the velocity collapsed, it essentially was a tightening of the money supply because there were simply fewer dollars circulating, because people were 'hording' them due to fear of economic collapse. Thus the value of the dollar rose due to the fewer number of dollars circulating NOT because there was a fixed number of dollars.
However, this also meant the real value of debt also increased fucking many a farmers. Farm mortgages collapse and so started the shit storm of the second dip of the Great Depression and the dust bowl.  
First and for most, bitcoin is an alternative currency which means that the retarded argument of a deflation spiral just isn't real--bitcoin holders can always relieve the spiral simply by cashing out to ANY other currency--be it gold, USD, or alt-coins. So this 'deflation' is really just a feature of a fixed supply, which as more people us it, the value will increase.
IF bitcoin lived in a vacuum then the deflation argument could work, but due to it's liquidity that just doesn't float. [Look at this graph]( no death spiral. 
Now where deflation argument falls flat on its face is that **bitcoin is property that has feature that make it act like a currency**, I call this liquid property. 
Meaning that because bitcoin has a fixed supply, in the same way that property is, and for the same reason the property is an investment--it is due to the fixed supply with increasing competition.
Let me know if I should elaborate anywhere.

True, value is subjective, but because we are both autonomous actors that can determine the marginal utility of an object, we can both arrive at our own conclusions as to what the value of it is. If that cow was the ONLY cow around and people paid high dollar for milk, you may still choose to take and sell that milk because you understand that subjectively for yourself it is not useful, but you also understand that the utility to others is high, and thus you could choose to sell it.
I chose the word intrinsic because of the natural qualities that are imbued within bitcoin that gives it additional value where we can find its utility. But yes, 'intrinsic' probably was not the best word to use.
