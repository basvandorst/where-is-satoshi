I've been mining since feb., I have the same thing but x 10! lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:58:51
and I still despise it!
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:28:24
You make 3D? I doubt it!
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:53:39
Yes, it will drop to 9,817.42 in 2 days, 7 hours, 46 minutes and 3 seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:26:56
Man, that was good in many ways! ROFL
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:25:16
Noise and heat level must be out of the roof!
I only have 2 in the shed and kept the temperature in there at 30C all winter.
Color, why? just why?
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:22:44
I have trust issues with these beasts!
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:41:28
Hats off to you!!! Really!
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:53:40
Will keep that in mind!! lol

Hi Folks, dying of cancer here, got a few months left if lucky.   I have a 0.2 BTC to sell for CAD... sent to my real bank account.  The thing is I am having a real tough time trusting anything, most want a sign-up, some have a couple of ways to sell/exchange/offer, very confusing..  I little light in something, one shot, simple and anonymous would be nice. or something thereabouts.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:39:57
Time is not a problem, so yeah, I realise it's a complicated way, but in my head, it's logical and safe in the end.
Keeping middle-men out of the equation was my goal.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:46:07
You mentioned shapeshift and I looked into it, I just find the fee a little high for the not so big BCH I have.
Are there other trustable exchanges out there?
edit: turns out it's pretty low compared to others! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:46:00
I'll try later.
BCH seems stable, will wait for a BTC dip before exchanging! ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:06:43
No worries there, I don't have enough BCH to really lose anything.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:22:16
3 x more than a few months ago, my mining payoffs are also 3 x less :-(
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:42:12
Ahhhh! thank you, this makes a whole lot of sense!
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:16:23
I regret not continuing to mine on PC when all this started many moons ago, got into mining with asic's this year, managed to to make 0.14 so far while using the generated heat for heating.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:22:42
For BCH -&gt; BTC, for my amount of BCH:
Shapeshift, 1.25%
Changelly, 0.5% .... but then the site went dead, came back eventually and getting errors signing up, It died again. oufff my trust went way down on this one.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:14:37
I didn't realise there was anything else besides BCH,  I guess I should investigate further...
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:06:47
Well, I have 2.7 TH/s with my three asic miners, I used to get about 0.00011200 BTC each time the pool would find a block (back in august), now I get about 0.00004600 BTC per block find.
I also noticed the hashing power (slushpool) trippled since then, from approx 288 Ph/s in August and has now reached 1000+ Ph/s.
Needless to say, it's getting less and less worth it.
Like one said, unless you have free electricity, or somehow use the generated heat for heating, it's probably not worth it anymore.
I use the heat for heating in winter and for the pool in summer, I probably break even or near even.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:13:33
I almost dealt with them a week ago, but the site wasn't responding and when it did it didn't last long.
My first impression destroyed my confidence in changelly.
I went with shapeshift and within about 20 minutes, all was received and confirmed, end of story.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:10:36
All went well, BTC transferred to new wallet (using ReadOnly755's method), BCH exchanged on shapeshift, all has received and been confirmed.
Happy camper I am.
Now, on another day, will do the bitcoin Gold in the same way.
I think I was more stressed then it was worth, better safe than sorry.
Thanks all!

Last comment, the other was too confused to understand! lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:04:49
thx. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:48:52
ok, I see a shit-ton of howto's to "claim" the free cash per-say. will read it all before trying anything ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:56:07
Yes I own the private key.
I see both BCC and BCH to stand for "Bitcoin Cash", what gives?
What do you mean by free money?
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:41:45
yeah, some folks don't have it when it comes to communications!
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:52:27
I only have 2 Antminer S5's @ 1.2 Ths and a Rockminer @ .5 Ths
Sent the heat to the pool during summer via a heat exchanger home made rig.
Pool is now closed, will heat external workshop this fall/winter.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:18:11
The 3 miners (having each 2 fans, 1 at each end) are mounted in a wooden box that separates cool intake and heated output, the heated output of all 3 are directed with more fans into 2 small radiators (I picked up at the scrap yard) connected in series to a tap in the pool outflow.
Did it help the pool, probably a bit, it cost me next to nothing to setup.
I just gotta check if the salt water is screwing the radiators though! ;-)
I've taking the setup apart for the winter season, can' t really take a picture, sorry.

Read up on it here: 
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:58:23
.12 here from asic mining since april this year ;-)
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:55:13
banks are slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow at adopting better ways to do ANYTHING.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:10:08
NOPE, not even close, try again!
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:44:45
NOT!
