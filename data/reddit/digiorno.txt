A lot of us wouldn't mind too much. We'd get some cheap coins and the weak hands would be removed from the greater crypto community. This would allow us to focus on building infrastructure and adoption without an army of trolls trying to tear us down at every turn. Why? Because weak hands are going to abandon the alt coins first as they have less chance of recovering. Meaning that once the alt hype has subsided, the pump and dump crowd will be gone at least for a little while.
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:30:44
Many major exchanges have stopped accepting new users so that they can upgrade their infrastructure.  So people with access have been divesting from
 BTC to Alts with the expectation that when the exchanges open back up again there will be a ton of people investing in both BTC and alts. I expect that a few weeks afterwards there will be an alt crash as those old traders convert their quick gains into BTC again. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:20:57
They won't even make a blip. It's not their personal bonuses you want hitting the market, it's their corporate funds. When one of these huge hedge funds throws 1% of their holdings at BTC then we'll start seeing some action. That they haven't done this yet shows just how risky the financial sector thinks this space is.

I think a few alts have posited such lofty goals, over the years. PandaCoin (replace Fiat for China) and ZETA coin (replace Fiat for Kenya?) come to mind. But then I didn't look too much into them and I doubt they are around anymore. 
I agree with you. I don't think anything will replace Fiat anytime soon. And if people want to lend with crypto then we will figure out a way to do it with Bitcoin eventually.

Maybe not legally. But there has been a tacit agreement in the crypto community that Bitcoin and the symbol BTC would be reserved for the first major Blockchain Currency and that all derivative technologies would adopt new names.  This is why the altcoins are not called Bitcoin 2.0 - 999.0.  And this is why Bitcoin Cash has the ticker BCH. This tactic by the Bitcoin cash community to somehow replace BTC is underhanded and I doubt it would've garnered much support if it was announced with that original intent. Since this negativity is coming from its leadership it essentially erodes all trust that one could've placed in them.  They've resorted to trying to trick people into supporting them so that they can make more money. If they are willing to do that for their own personal gain then how can I trust that they won't someday betray those that follow them for personal gain as well?
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:49:09
The real advantage is their security and insurance. Every users' Fiat is insured up to $250,000 and every users' crypto is 100% insured. They also keep like 90% of their crypto in cold storage so that it is very difficult to steal. And users can opt to put theirs in a "vault" which I think is airgapped cold storage.  
For new users this is a ton of reassurance that they won't have their money stolen because by now everyone has heard of people losing fortunes on Mt. Gox or Cryptsy.

Pepsi's real upgrade was centralizing distribution centers under singular leadership. Coke worked with a ton of individual companies who did distribution but they took advantage of coke and made it very difficult to push national marketing campaigns.

Step 1: acquire bitcoin
Step 2: buy a less shitty family 
Seriously though. Use a hardware wallet, for the bulk of it and put it in a safety deposit box. Keep some on a mobile wallet (Bread, Loaf, etc)  for day to day usage.  If you're extra cautious, put the seed words in another safety deposit box. Lastly list the someone in your will to get the contents of your safety deposit boxes. I recommend that you don't list one of your family members.

@_date: 2018-01-29 06:19:41
Probably best to use a different bank than your Fiat one anyway. If they ever flag your crypto purchases/sales and freeze your account then they could also block access to your safety deposit box as a measure to stop "laundering". If your safety deposit box is at a different bank then you'll always have access.

Re-reading your comments makes it look like you are referring to the original Bitcoin as Bitcoin Legacy.

You obviously don't know much about Steve Wozniak. I recommend that you read up on him, as he is a fascinating and incredibly intelligent person.

Now the thing about Woz is that he often goes against the grain. So if he is supporting crypto then I wouldn't be surprised if the powers that be try to squash it.

No regulation. This is basically the Wild West of finance. They're trying to steal the "brand" because legally there is nothing stopping them. There is no trademark or copyright on Bitcoin. So some very greedy people raised a ton of money and decided that they'd try to take over the Bitcoin. They forked the chain and are spending a fortune on misleading marketing campaigns. Unfortunately they have a lot of other greedy people supporting them and they do not care who they hurt while executing their mission to get rich.

The LN will fix that but realistically a zero config spend is fine for pretty much everything. No one is going to spend millions of dollars trying to double spend on a small purchase and if they did then it would be caught shortly afterwards. I pay people with LTC very often (prefer to hold on to my BTC) and never once has someone had an issue that it wasn't fully confirmed. Honestly most people are fine as long as they see the "pending" notification pop up on their wallet. And those who weren't, were happy after seeing one confirmation.

Which is why smart investors will either play it safe with BTC or seek out coins that are making significant progress towards becoming a robust 2nd layer.  Just as there was a first mover advantage for BTC there will be a first mover advantage to coins which establish themselves on the LN, early on.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:47:19
None of the hundreds of forks from BTC have tried to take the name BTC with them. When they forked, they got a new name, either as "Bitcoin +*insert catchy name*" or as an altcoin with a completely unrelated name. There was a degree of respect given by recognizing that they were a derivative work. If Bitcoin Cash's marketing team simply stuck with "Bitcoin Cash" instead promoting themselves as "Bitcoin" then I doubt as many people would have a problem with them. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:12:29

In the long run BTC and LTC will have a very successful partnership through the LN. The two communities should work together to better expose the sham that is BCH.  A lot of people, who are interested in Bitcoin, are going to get burned if Ver keeps up this disinformation campaign. And LTC offers one of the primarily benefits that Bcash does in that it is not prohibitively expensive to buy a full coin (yet). Those who dip their toes in with LTC instead of BCH will eventually realize that owning a whole BTC is over rated and Atomic swap over to the real thing anyway.

We're trying to reassure them. Bitcoin has crashed many times and while this may be the final crash, it probably isn't.
Many of us have hodl' since the $1100 to $370 crash. A few have been around since the $266 to $50 calamity and even fewer saw the $32 to $2 but still hodl. 
I know history isn't guaranteed to repeat itself but unless BTC hits about $7,000 then this crash isn't on a comparable scale to the last big crash.  And even if it falls the same scale as the worst crash in its history it will still be worth over $1,000 and you can bet at those prices people will be scooping it up like mad.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:37:41

No, it would not be okay. The people supporting those projects wouldn't like it because they'd be mis-represented. Twitter wouldn't like it because people would trust it less as a platform.

It's about as worthless as WOW gold. It was 100% premined. It was traded on very few exchanges using known methods to pump the price. The devs own most of the coins and an org closely related to them own even more. Very very few coins are actually in circulation and owned by independent investors.  But you'd never know that because the volume is so manipulated. Ripple is basically "in game currency" for real life and the owners can do anything they want with the currency.  If any crypto is going to be targeted by the SEC and bring a call for regulation on crypto currencies then this is it.

Bitcoin is electronic money, there is no border and there are no restrictions other than those required to secure the block chain.

Many many people do not have bank accounts, cannot get bank accounts or do not want bank accounts. It's a huge problem for people mostly paid in cash. And having all of your assets in cash is a huge liability. Cryptos are way safer for them to hodl than cash as long as the price doesn't go down too much. These unbanked people can buy crypto and deposit it in cold storage for safe keeping or on Coinbase which then will act like their bank account. Lastly the idea that their meager savings might someday become a fortune is spurring them to gamble some of their money on this scene. It's not wise but I'd be surprised if this is not contributing to the high LBTC price.

Unless you plan to trade it probably doesn't matter much. Buying your first bitcoin now will still make you an early adopter. If this thing really blows up then most people will never see a whole bitcoin just as they won't ever see a whole bar of gold. I suggest just buying what you can and sitting on it for a few months. If it dips after you buy then do not sell it, just hold and wait. This is kind of the long term all or nothing strategy but its the safest provided it doesn't crash permanently.

Or even just becoming the company that people use for bitcoin. Realistically unless wallets get fantastically easier to use and protect then most people will need a bitcoin service to make it easier. Visa could easily establish a new ultra secure card service on the back of bitcoin. They could use their vista card and select debit credit or BTC.  They'd kill our current payment processors or maybe even acquire them. When using BTC on you Visa card would require users to enter in a one use pin that was sent to their phone (2FA).  It could be a game changer because they could offer visa to all places that they can't currently and they put up huge safeguards against fraud. They could move into rural africa, set up wifi hot spots, establish a super secure electronic money system and make bank in the long run by breaking into an area that wasn't previously profitable.  They probably wouldn't even have to update their current infrastructure that much.

I agree. I've talked to my parents about bitcoin maybe twice, my cousins once and my friends only when they ask about it or need to pay me back.  People will come around eventually if this is all it is cracked up to be. I personally think it is big and honestly think it will become more of a financial tool for banks than something people knowingly use in day to day activities. I bet we'll see debit cards, secured by bitcoin, and no one using it will need to know anything about a Blockchain or transaction fees or anything. Banks will just say oh look you can transfer whatever amount of money and use your account anywhere in the world for free. Or something along those lines. Bitcoin could save large institutions a ton of money in infrastructural costs. Sure I'll get a paycheck sent to my bank and they'll use bitcoin to do it but I'll never know any difference, it will just look like a new and improved banking system.

There is speculation that China has been mining bitcoin too.  I've heard some people say their heavy handedness was only in part to prevent wealth from leaving before they had all their pieces ready. I've heard that the real reason for roadblocks is to keep bitcoin out of the hands of their financial elite so that they don't have as much power later on. The idea is that they want the current system to collapse so they can switch to metals and crypto currency but unlike gold they can almost ensure that they are the single largest holders of bitcoin reserves. This would give them unprecedented power because as the world's leading exporter they could demand payments in bitcoin or precious metal, but obviously the electronic method would be preferred.  Back to limiting exposure of BTC to their people, they don't want their rich to have BTC because then they'd still be rich after all is said and done. The rich pose problems for them and by preventing access right now they can help take them down a notch later, supposedly.

Undocumented workers in America don't have it so easy. Not to mention we're talking about global scale for bitcoin. It is not like Wells Fargo will issue debit cards to people in Zimbabwe or that Americans can travel to China and use their debit card without accruing fees. Bitcoin could make it easy for people of all walks of life and in all nations to transact money between each other and have a permanent record of the transaction to boot. We can't even transact directly between debit cards, we always need a middle man which generally means it costs money to use money. If you're not convinced that debit cards are not both limited in accessibility and utility, at least globally,  then that's fine by me but at this point it is your choice to remain this ignorant.

Gold does have industrial uses but for the most part it is used as a store of wealth for banks, governments and the IMF. These institutions tend to use good delivery gold bars.   A good delivery gold bar is 12.44kg of highly pure metal and it currently costs $495,200.  There have been an estimated 174100 tonnes of gold mined in human history or approximately 1.3e7 good delivery gold bars worth.  Let's assume all the mined gold is in bar form, though we know it's not. We will also assume that if bitcoin becomes a store of wealth then 1BTC will be the standard unit of measurement for banks just as 1 good delivery gold bar is for the precious metal we all know and love. Let's also assume no gold or bitcoin is ever lost and not much more gold is mined. So with those assumptions in place there are 13,000,000 gold bars, which means by 2140 there will be about 61.5% more bitcoins than gold bars. So a bitcoin will be a good bit less rare than a gold bar more than a hundred years from now. But right now bitcoin is actually more rare by about 1 million units.  If it really were as valuable as gold in terms of utility for wealth storage then each bitcoin would be worth just over the cost of a gold bar. Now we could argue that because it will become less rare, it will lose value but it has more benefits than just a store of wealth, vastly more benefits than gold ever did, so it might maintain or even grow in value.  Now see it isn't too difficult to pull numbers out your rear and come up with a much higher value for bitcoin than it currently trades at. The game will change if and when the banks and governments decide to use bitcoin as a store of wealth. They don't have to suggest use of it as a currency for everyday folk just like they don't use gold that way anymore. So even as a store of value if bitcoin is seen as precious as gold then it has a good deal more to grow in terms of market price. As I've heard people say "in the future, it will be rare for a person to ever see one whole bitcoin",  just as it is rare for a person to ever see one 12.44kg gold bar.

I personally think he and his employees 'only' had a few thousand BTC stolen from a hot wallet before noticing they were in trouble.   Then they decided to take the rest of the BTC out of cold storage and bail with the intent of using the original theft as cover. I think it's more likely that they are crooks than completely inept at storing bitcoin properly.

Get some trusted volunteers to run interviews for corporate applicants before confirming admittance. I envision something similar to the system that many private torrent websites use to vet members. They more or less try to establish four-five things before letting someone in: 
1) An understanding of the rules. Done via a short quiz of random sections of the site's guidelines.
2) The reason behind their bid to join. Do they want to participate in the community, have access to tons of lossless music, help build up the sites features, etc. 
3) An acceptable outcome on a trustworthiness test. This is usually done a few different ways. One is by getting an invite from a trusted member, basically a vouching system. Another by revealing impressive upload/download ratios for other sites. A third giving acceptable answers to questions concerning the site, such as 'would you ever sell an invite?' or 'how much ratio buffer would you expect to get if you uploaded our exclusive content on another site?'. 
4) Passing a personality test. Some sites let the interviewer play it by ear and give a quick once over based on demeanor through personal questions and casual conversation. If the interviewee is rude, aggressive, haughty, greedy, immoral then they are sometimes disqualified even if they fulfill the other requirements . Things like promising to donate extra  money in exchange for admission or simply wanting acceptance because they collect memberships are standard red flags that interviewers look out for. 
5) An understanding of the site's topic of interest and the general principles behind that topic. This isn't always used to eliminate applicants, it is sometimes used to categorize them based on their skill and knowledge. 
The burden of proof is always on the applicant and the materials required to make an attempt at membership are always clearly spelled out. The interviewers are usually randomly assigned, sometimes their identity is unknown to the applicant. This sort of thing is often started off with trusted members who frequent the IRC. It sometimes  leads to creation of unpaid positions that forum/IRC members volunteer or even interview for.  There are sometimes rules that applicants can't be interviewed by people they know, but in small communities this can be difficult. 
I've got to go but you're probably smart enough to come up with examples of these guidelines which would work for the btc foundation. I'll try to think of a few this afternoon and get back to this later. For one I don't recommend a invite system...

IMO their only way to fix all of this is to be forward about their problems, reimburse people whatever they can and shut down for repairs. The repairs should be done by newly hired experts with good reputations and much experience in the bitcoin community.  They should spare no expense in this. Cleaning house of whoever fucked up 
 and replacing their CEO with someone who has some business competency are also necessary. Basically they need to rebuild from the ground up...
TLDR: If Gox wants to survive they should reimburse customers, remove the CEO, reinvest in infrastructure and reboot.

Here is some of the best advice that I heard and I'll share it with you. For cold storage make multiple backups of your wallet, put them on at least three different types of media and store them in at least two different locations.
So back up wallet to encrypted HDD, sd card, flash drive and cd. Give  copies to your parents or cousins or friends or put in a safe deposit box. This way you won't lose everything in a house fire or hard disk crash.

Why would I write an email when I could just write a letter?
Why should I just trust this internet thing will deliver my message when I know the USPS always will?
Can't other people just steal and read my email whenever they want, how is this safe?
We didn't have to shove email down their throats, it became so easy and so useful that people eventually didn't notice that they went along with it. If we can make bitcoin as easy as email then it will win people over quickly. Right now it's still in the early development phase where geeks and futurists are taking interest and spouting grand ideas and most everyone else thinks they're glassy eyed day dreamers for doing so. Luckily with the reach of the internet this thing has potential to go from 'those people are crazy' to 'bitcoin is common place, everyone uses it' in just few years time.

That was the worst part, because they provide no route for one to prove ownership and I was on the phone asking them to let me. I even submitted a decent vacation photo of a beach in Thailand and they said no. It was just an empty beach with no one on it. Now, if I had made a small PR mess on twitter or on their Facebook page then maybe it could've been sorted out but for most people it's WF's images or nothing.

It's because they haven't looked into it. I work at a tech company and even my coworkers thought it was more like video game currency than anything else.  I introduced some facts for them to ponder but if didn't help much. They said it was too difficult to use because they didn't  know anything about cryptography. I said that they probably didn't know much about the underpinnings of email either but that they use that technology everyday. I explained more about the top down technological benefits and then a few of them started getting it. When those few saw it was both technology and a currency they even bought a few fractions of a BTC from coin base. Most of my coworkers still look at me like I'm crazy so I say I sold all my coins, save one, before the last crash. I say I keep one just in case it really does blow up one day .

Honestly...I don't know. I kind of like that LTC doesn't have any of the airdrop drama that BTC has. But it's always been an underdog and that comes with its own drama. I don't think you could go wrong with BTC, LTC or VTC. The dev teams are all working towards the same goal. The VTC devs for example have been crucial in creating the lightning network platform. So even though their coin hasn't broke the $10 cap yet, I expect that it will someday see huge gains from their efforts on this joint project. Why else would they put in so much work? That said, whose to say if those gains will be larger than LTC or BTC? Whatever you do, don't keep your coins on any exchange with the exception of Coinbase. And that's only because they are insured for both fiat and crypto and keep 90 % of coins in cold storage.

Easy. People sell en mass and the price crashes for 1-3 years. Just like it did the last few times. Basically a ton of people will invest and pump the price to unimaginable heights and some of them will sell. Some others will call bullshit on the revolutionary tech (even though it IS game changing) and they'll sell too. Eventually the market will recover, like the Internet after the .com crash did but it'll be the good ideas which survive. Ideas like BTC, VTC, LTC. It'll be the tokens which die off.  I'm just saying we should all expect a haircut sometime within the next few years...

Most folks forget that there are a few people here who've been hodling BTC since it was $20 some who've been here since $50 and many more who've hodled since $100-200. They hodled through crashes of 20%, 40% and would probably hodl though an 80% drop too. 
Why? 
Because they see BTC for the tech and its promise for a brighter future. They didn't invest in BTC to get rich, they invested to play a part in changing the world. They want to tell their grandchildren, "I was there when Cyrptos upended the financial system. I was one of the first to make a move against the bankers." 
And since they know how to hodl through thick and thin, they will probably be telling them that story on the porch of a very nice house with an all electric lambo parked out front. But will that have "cashed out"? No, because by then they'll be able to buy all things with Bitcoin.

They've generated a lot of money for the people creating them though.  Maybe he doesn't care if his projects "succeed", maybe he just wants some quick and easy money. And since he has a big company on his resume people might trust him a bit more than more ICO founders.
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:49:42
Theoretically they'd build up a huge store of BTC before announcing. Then they'd work hard to push adoption which would greatly increase the price to the point that it rarely fluctuated (presumably very high). Then not only would they be getting payment instantly from their customers without any middlemen, they'd have increased the value of their initial investment my a considerable degree. Both cutting out middle men and 10xing a sizeable investment would be massively profitable for them.

The no alt coin discussion seems a little antiquated now that BTC is going to be interacting with alt coins through LN and AS.

Investments shouldn't be your top priority at the moment unless they're in food, shelter or professional development/job hunting.
You could easily lose 20%, 40% or 60% overnight if you put it into crypto. Not too long ago BTC was sitting mighty high at $1000 and then it was suddenly $550-600 for what seemed like ages. LTC was $40 and then seemingly overnight it was $3, for like three years.  That sort of risk should over power your FOMO.

No, it's not. your concerns have been addressed at length. Besides, the Lightning network will make it cheap and quick to use. And with atomic swaps there won't be much need for coins which are not on the LN.
Also, stop concern trolling. After looking at your post history I want to warn you, ReiBlocks is a premined shit coin and the "nano rebrand" is a lame effort to make it seem "new" so that the price can be pumped even more. You should get out while you can.

It's just like back in the day if you wanted to send a non-text attachment over email the you needed to manually encode it and the paste it as BinHex code into the message. And then the recipient had to decode it to see what you sent. This was the standard process for nearly five years and then the system was able to encode it for you. But it still took another ten years of development for attachments to even resemble what you see today.
BTC and the LN are in their infancy.  The tech and the implementation of the tech will improve in time. Just as people used to manually encode attachments for email, people must now manually do much work to send BTC or LTC across the LN. But if you give it a few years then it will be seamless and the majority of users won't even know what magic is going on in the background.

They messed with Cisco, Microsoft and pretty much every major tech company. They've even got root access on a hardware level to almost every server in existence. 
Do you think they have no hooks in google or android or any of the phone manufacturers or cell phone service providers? None at all?
You're a fool if you think android or windows phone devices  are any more protected from surveillance  than the iPhone. This is especially so when you consider that some service providers even have dedicated server rooms for the NSA (ahem att).  Also the more devices out there the more likely they found a way in. Using android or windows might even expose you to more risk because they have so many more avenues of attack. So many companies make those phones and install custom software prior to selling it that they're practically announcing the fact there are back doors. Apple at least has a walled garden and don't allow third parties to preload software. The NSA said the only way they can corrupt iPhones is with physical access usually done by rerouting deliveries and installing custom code. 
The short of it is that all smart mobile devices should be considered compromised until proven otherwise. Apple  isn't remotely alone in this mess so don't distract from the issue by making this a fanboy war.

In 1971 the US government stopped the dollar/gold exchange standard and in 1973 it no longer backed the dollar value with an equivalent in gold. In 1974 the prohibition on private gold ownership was lifted and the public was legally allowed to buy and own gold bars. But before the gold standard backing was abolished, it was nearly impossible to exchange certificates for gold. As far back as 1933 the government ran by the policy that exchanges that once had to be dealt with in gold could be settled in dollars.

Best of luck finding a new place to work. You could also just help BTC become accepted by the current system.  You might be able to get your bank to open up a new position for you, bitcoin consultant...or something along those lines. You're already seen as trustworthy, so they might want to use your knowledge.

I think it could go back to $150 and still recover, sub $100 probably not. We haven't been in the $200+ range for that long and we've had massive drops in the past.

Also they are scared of volatility or they will claim that. The higher price helps lower the risk of sudden value drops. But I agree this is kind of like ticket master charging extra for you to print at your own home. There are better ways to do this but they are choosing the method that milks the most money.

They could profit by being the first major tech company to make BTC easy for the masses.  iOS and Mac OS integrated secure wallets.  People already go crazy for their products and this would be another reason. I could see apple buying coinbase to do this.  Or not ya know Internet funny money may just be too strange for them.

It's going to be a store of wealth for most holders of whole BTC. The exchanges are going nowhere until people start getting paid in BTC and can use it for everyday life. Even then they'll still exist because things like USD and the euro aren't going to vanish.  It just going to be a new global commodity/currency.

Probably billions before too long. The technology alone is worth a lot to people that move tons of money around.  The store of wealth potential is also great, it's like buying into the invention of gold. Bitcoin has too much going for it for wall street to not want a slice. Wall Street pretty much invests in anything that can even remotely be invested in. It'll be interesting to see how they change this game.

Go get a gym membership, sign up for a class or two and go a few times a week. 
If you don't do that then make sure you take a nice 30min-1hr walk everyday just to clear your head. 
I you ever feel the need to pick up BTC again then buy one or two and immediately put them in a paper wallet. Give the address to your folks to put in one safety deposit box and keep the key in your own. This way you can't touch the damn things unless someone else is there with you.

If you own even just .25 BTC you are an early adopter. This medium of exchange is only five years old and it has only become slightly mainstream with common tech savvy folk in the past year. If you used email only five years after it was invented then you'd have been an early adopter of that too.  
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:23:13
Make a back up of your current wallet first. Maybe make a few copies and change the name to currentwallet.dat.

I kind of think of it like investing in email or SMS. I see value in the technology and I see that for it to succeed it needs people to adopt it and use it. We need to make it invaluable in some ways. Unfortunately to adopt bitcoin means you have to  change some of your "real" money into this "Internet" money.  This is done by buying it outright or converting your power bill into BTC. 
If this technology takes off then I might make a huge return on my investment, just as someone might have if they could've invested in email. But the main result I want to see is for he people of this world to be a little more in control of their lives and have a bit more financial freedom. If BTC fails as a currency but the technology lives on in part because of my investment then I'll still be happy with my decision to help out. I'll be even happier if I am rich but the greater good comes first, it's what inspired this whole thing to begin with.

Not just apple. It's foolish to think it is just apple. Hell att has even admitted to having special NSA data routing rooms. They also pre load special software and builds on android and windows phones. It's insane to think those devices aren't compromised. If even Cisco hardware is bugged at the hardware level then it stands to reason they could done the same to a smart phone before it was ever sold, regardless of manufacturer.

Non techies can distinguish between credit, debit, paypal and precious metals. This just adds one more payment system. Tell them bitcoin is kind of like a combination of PayPal, debit and gold. 
BTC offers near instant transactions between users, it can't be counterfeit,  it is used mostly online but can also be used in person.  Lastly most people only use part of a BTC at a time just like they'd likely use only part of a gold bar if they were paying with gold.

Cash is associated with more fraud both in value and percentage.  I don't see banks banning cash. Bitcoin is a competitor, that's why they shut it down. Protect the children and fight the drug lords and tax evaders is just a go to cover.

Yeah right now a tiny tiny fraction of humans even own any bitcoin. If it becomes a global currency where everyone knows about it and might even use it occasionally then the people who have even just 1 BTC will be few and far between. People who have tens of BTC will be even fewer and those who have hundreds or thousands will be living on their own islands. I'm not a holder of many BTC at all but this is kind of like a gold rush or oil boom. Digital currencies are the future and BTC is the first popular one out there.

Actually some banks have been known to not post transactions or provide an accurate available balance when you have a low balance. They then will process several transactions in such an order as to maximize the over draft and insufficient funds fees. I think BOA was even sued for this as recently as last year.

The ones I don't like are those who are obviously upset that they didn't invest earlier and simply want to rain on the parade. I've even met these people in person. When BTC was going for $100 they were incredibly interested and now they tell me that it's a scam and will be worthless tomorrow.  To shut them up I say I only have two coins and have already cashed out my initial investment. If it goes up to $10k then I'll say I sold just to keep them off my back. It's even worse because in the same tirade they'll talk about how a wise investment would be apple or tesla or some random dividend stock. While true those wouldn't have paid off nearly as well as BTC this last year. Yes, this is a high risk/high reward game but it's my risk to take so please stop warning me.
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:00:22
They could go both ways. Put in a $100 and get .1BTC sent to your wallet. Today there are cash only businesses that have ATMs for customers who usually use debit or credit. Maybe someday there will be bitcoin only businesses who have BTC ATMs for people to exchange cash or credit for BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:21:00
Hey, all of your purchases helped legitimase BTC and  all of your losses to preorders helped warn us about scammers. We all owe you some thanks. Also think of it this way, you have more BTC now than most humans will ever even see in their lifetime. On reddit it might seem like pennies but on a large scale you're still an early adopter and a big holder.  Heck most adopters in two or three years time probably won't even own a single BTC and holy shit you have 20 + whatever you can mine. Soon we'll regularly see day to day transactions done in mBTC or smaller. You're still probably going to be rich if you wait long enough, just don't make the same mistake again. Thanks again for helping BTC thrive.
