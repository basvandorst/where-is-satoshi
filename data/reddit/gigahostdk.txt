Reversibility of the product/service is our condition.
We run a hosting service and can easily deactivate an account again if it'd never confirm. Similarly, many types of domain names can be deleted (and we'd get a refund) within the first 72 hours.
This is much better than risking a credit card chargeback after several months.

Thanks for your helpful input, everyone! We're refunding in the fiat equivalent for now, and will state the refund policy more clearly in the future (and probably offer BTC pricing as an alternative).

Maybe we'll have to change it a bit, as the Terms of Service currently simply state: *A 30 days full right of return is given on the hosting account – the full amount is refunded.*

OK - so this is what we are going to do for starters. Later, we'll make the price list in BTC along with other currencies (but perhaps updating it every week or so).

Oh, we aren't trying to be cheap on this specific refund! That's going to be okay, however, we are interested in the general practice and to set up the right policies for the future.

I think this post describes our concern the best. On the flipside we would not want to provide a worse service to BTC customers by not offering the money-back guarantee.

It could be a special notice though, and not just part of the TOS, which people (presumably) never read.

No, a conversion happens during checkout. The customer is then shown the BTC amount, and is requested to transfer the BTC amount to a specified address for processing.
(We'd like to show fixed BTC prices in the price list, though, but that requires some rework of our systems)

But then it'd always be a "loser's game" for us, since the customer would be equally unhappy in the situation where the BTC 'value' had gone up, and we refunded a lower BTC amount.
(So to make everyone happy, we should start pricing in BTC) :)
