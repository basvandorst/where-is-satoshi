Don’t wait. Buy as it goes down and if we are at the bottom now then look, you bought at the lowest! If it’s not you can continue to make purchases at lower and lower points so your dollar cost average keeps getting lower and lower so that when it pops back up you will have not missed out on a ton of profits but have stayed very safe and smart in your purchases.

Go and buy a new 8th generation intel CPU. They have integrated graphics that support 4K and they are pretty freaking powerful.

Where are you located? My favorite one is shift debit card. It’s especially convenient if you are mining because you can mine nicehash and then transfer for free every day from nicehash to coinbase which is where shift withdraws from

@_date: 2018-01-09 16:15:44
No. There’s no such thing as slowing transactions ���� every single hash created serves to solve a block and help transactions go through faster. If you could mine with an iPhone or a raspberry pi you are contributing to speeding up transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:50:19
just get a shift card. i hate that it uses coinbase but it works really well so i recommend it. you can use it anywhere a debit card is accepted
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:18:54
I mean it could be. But the crypto markets are entirely different beast than they were in 2013 and while some comparisons can be made, it’s an entirely different world. There is an increasing amount of people who have very little understanding at all of what they are buying, there thousands and thousands of more miners, there are futures trading, as well as a huge emergence of erc20 tokens and hundreds of new currencies that have come out since then. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:37:13
Won’t that just make it more profitable for the rest of us to mine???

One of the last holdouts haha. What can you do on the jailbreak that I can’t do? Genuinely curious. I haven’t jailbroken since ios6
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:59:29
No that’s completely lately normal. That’s called dollar cost averaging

Well, it may show up in iOS 11 or 12 as well haha
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:18:57
I’m so mad I was broke when it was at 3.5 lol.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:10:14
Nope. This is crypto. I’m stoked it dropped, I was able to round out my btc to 0.5!
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:22:59
Get out of here
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:21:26
It says they got hacked and lost 184 billion btc? What the hell?
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:21:30
wasnt it a spike downwards in 2018 that lead us to $3500 bitcoin? haha
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:59:45
Gotcha. So not much has changed haha. Although back on ios6, all the custom stuff KILLED battery life haha. The two things I used the most were SBSettings, and unlocked tethering, both of which are built into iOS now��
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:12:54
No, this is great. Btc went too high to fast. Put in a bit more and wait it out. I have no fear btc will break 13k again in the near future��

Settle down mr. “redditor for a day”
@_date: 2019-07-24 20:45:50
Yah, saw that too. Doubt this guy is mining with equipment that should be dead....
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:06:33
Yah, totally get it ahha. My biggest problem is that the newest device you can have is an iPhone 7 if my memory is correct. That’s just too old and slow for me�� but I get a new phone every year. The trick is to get the phones on Black Friday and get a $300 gift card every year. Then it’s typically around like $450 to pay the phone off and then you can sell it for $650 so it costs me $450 to pay it off and I net $550 bback, so i make $100 a year to get the new phone haha. And then I’m always under warranty as well
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:22:13
And it’s rusty.....
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:57:19
No I totally get what you’re saying lol. If it were to spike to 20k tomorrow, you can bet I’m dumping 100% and waiting for winter again. In the immortal words of the starks..... winter is coming
@_date: 2019-07-23 23:12:47
Gotcha, yah in general it seems like jail breaking is a dying art form mostly because Apple keeps adding more and more features. Some are copies from jailbreak stuff, and others are just cool features that lure some average joes over to the standard iOS builds...... but that’s coming from someone who has been our if that game for a while lol

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:28:27
Do ably at Christmas for the same reason it did at thanksgiving. That being said it could very well keep declining until then and reach a bottom low of day 10k and then jump up to 13-14k over a day or so. Or I could be 100% wrong about everything. No one know. Nothing is sure
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:44:49
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:23:57
Dude, you’ve been a redditor for a day! How do you know about bitcoin and tethers and what not?!
All joking aside, totally get it. I’m hesitant to get excited about any “gains” im in things for the long haul, so I don’t really play with the money I’ve got in bitcoin. 80% is in cold storage. 20% I’ll trade with. Last time when it hit 13,500 I sold and then bought at 11,000. Love the feeling of increasing my position. This bull run didn’t feel wonky until it broke 10k. I expected there to be far more resistance and hesitation at 10k with a couple more drops to low 9000’s but it just blasted right through everything...
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:27:43
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:25:11
yes. literally anytime your crypto changes, whether its direct trade of crypto to crypto, or crypto to fiat you must declare
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:46:56
I mean, people were mining before 2015...... before the government declared the net neutral. I doubt anything will change.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:55:41
I’m like 60-70% btc. Depends how much btc goes up compared to other coins lol. I was originally 50% btc but that’s changed recently
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:48:19
It’s BCH not BCC. BCC is bitconnect. Any exchange that says otherwise is wrong
@_date: 2019-07-27 04:37:11
Ahahhaha thanks man!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:28:30
Yes. It’s called arbitrage
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:33:20
Let’s be real. I don’t see anywhere in his post that mentions he’s gonna point is cheapo rig towards bitcoin proper and solo mine it. Or even pool mine it. The dude wants to mine and make a little cash. A great option is nicehash because it’s got a great UI and you get paid in bitcoin which is about as close to mining bitcoin straight as you can get. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:59:24
I gave you one too
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:58:21
After reading that it’s loud I bought one anyway and don’t regret anything. It’s loud but my vacuum cleaner is louder. It’s behind a door in my basement and I don’t hear a thing

In how long of a time? A year? 6 months? 4 months? 2 months? You have to give a time before you can calculate a price
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:19:22
Let’s do it
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:25:23
I mean I agree there needs to be things implemented to make bitcoin better, and that will come in time. But I wouldn’t say it’s dying. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:29:58
100% you are taking advantage of differences in exchanges and in some ways helping the system so a bitcoin is worth the same everywhere
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:13:35
Cex-&gt; bitcoin cash -&gt; bitmain 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:25:35
Ive loved working with cex. Highly recommend
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:54:09
Because bitmain only sells in batches
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:59:00
Seems off to me.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:30:33
Good chance of dipping since 60 million was just stolen from nicehash
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:37:52
Wait what are you talking about?��
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:57:28
So it didn’t actually fork?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:53:58
I use nicehash. I make roughly $25 a day after electricity costs.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:34:25
So why do more places not support segwit?
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:18:17
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:57:19
It’s only insured if Coinbase the company is hacked. If you give out your password and someone hacks your account specifically and takes your money, it’s not insured.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:36:57
Segwit is still 1mb blocks. And very few people have implemented it
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:18:16
I mean if it’s free electricity and you already own the parts I would 100% say go for it. Even if it only makes a couple pennies you are coming out ahead.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:49:22
Pretty much yes. The biggest difference is block size and lack of segwit. If you want a coin that’s similar but has more differences then you have litecoin which has segwit and 2.5 minute blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:53:23
BCH not BCC
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:51:43
How about use WhatToMine.com. It’s accurate for everything else I’ve used it for
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:05:37
at this point i can come out ahead by selling all of my equipment, so im really not concerned with a dip or an all out crash. (that being said, i dont want things to crash.....)
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:45:07
It’s mostly exchanges that charge the insane fees. If you look at the current data for transaction fees, they are going through for under $1
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:43
Exchanging crypto to crypto is not considered a like kind transaction so you are for sure required to declare if. Even if it’s an erc20 token for an erc20 token
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:30
Doubt it. Using shapeshift in wallet still counts
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:38:32
my transaction on sunday took 17 hours on coinbase.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:44:24
Are you..... mining outside??
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:38:24
Unless you sell on local bitcoins and don’t get caught
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:57:15
Some exchanges list BCC as bitcoin cash and it’s wrong..... not your fault. If bitconnect didn’t exist then bitcoin cash can have both the same way bitcoin has BTC and XBT but someone has a claim on BCC so it makes no sense to have multiple coins with the same name
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:16:56
That’s not a Tesla 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:50:53
i mean...... all you have to do is pull some out. if it goes up, you only lost the difference. if it goes down, then you van buy in at a lower price and you can increase your position. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:30
You are only taxed on the difference so you probably came out ahead
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:38:26
You can’t mine anything that’s not sha256 with a bitcoin miner

Based on my understanding, yes, you are correct
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:25:47
Has any exchange ever done this?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:26:13
Good to know, mostly just curious on the theoretical process. Assumed that it would be possible because it’s not adding new coins or anything��
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:07:43
I’ve deposited and withdrawn several times and had no issues. I love cex. It’s my go to exchange where I do all of my day trading
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:03:48
What does that mean? Will that be fore CBOE, cme? Or both?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:53
Pounds? Euros? Surely not dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:51:18
Hodling is the best option. However I have gotten lucky and have increased my position several times. It’s all about timing. Last week when everything was crashing a bit I saw there was a ton of volume going through and the spread was pretty big. Sellers were about $200 higher than the buyers, and because there was movement I was able to put in slightly higher buy orders than other people so they filled instantly and then put a slightly lower price for a sell order so it sold instantly. In a half hour I increased my holdings by 17%. It was scary as hell because I knew at any moment I could lose my shirt, but I came out on top. I was only day trading the money I wS willing to take a loss on and that’s key. Don’t invest your life savings and then day trade it.

I don’t think verge has much chance. It’s a very generic coin that’s nothing but a clone of dogecoin with an added layer of nothing special privacy. Plus look at how much verge is held by the top 100 wallets. That’s too much control for any group of individuals. That being said I own verge and I’m just waiting until I can cash out and make the return I want. I bought in at 6 cents

I would just use local bitcoins and then use that for my every day transactions such as gas and food and buy gift cards. Then use all of my hard earned salary to save basically all of it and use that for the house. I can pretty much live off a prepaid debit card and amazon gift cards plus food and gas.

True. But if I had millions I would be more willing to pay taxes because I would have avenues to throw money into that can lower taxes just like warren buffet and Bernie Sanders. I’m talking as a little guy here making say 100k a year at a job and maybe another 100k in crypto. Save most of the crypto so it builds up and then sell what I need to to pay for groceries, gas, and other home expenses. Live like that for a few years while saving say 50k a year from your salary and 50k a year in crypto and you can convert it all at once and buy a home

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:01:27
Yes, and they could have seen it was a hack and disconnected from the internet until a new verifiably safe connection was made, once back online they could have moved their remaining funds to a new safe protected wallet. We don’t know how much the hack was.

All my friends keep saying crypto is dead, every news source says the same. I think we hit the bottom and this is the beginning of the next run. I hope it doesn’t go parabolic again but if it does I’m jumping out earlier haha. Nice steady growth is much preferred.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:51:04
Bittrex takes a bit. But they are also spending 250ish satoshis per byte when they need less than 1/5th of that I believe. This makes the transaction for sure get into the next block which is nice, but it’s overspending for sure
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:01:49
Well you were correct on cex. Hit 12250 or something close to that 
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:27:43

He can afford two rx 580 and on nicehash he should be making $4 a day or so..... not sure how you checked a mining calculator without him saying what he was buying.

Not only that but nothing is guaranteed. I have an average. The last 24 hours I lost 0.2% rather than making around 0.3%. You make what the automated bot makes not some set percentage daily.

Look into it. They have full transparency. You can see where all the money is at any given time. They are based in the United States with a team of actual people.

They have an automated trading bot, a customizable trading bot, and an arbitrage tracker. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:04:42
Oh I agree. I’m just making the point that crypto isn’t dead��
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:27:12
If it’s 8 hours a day it’s a decent chance it might be a work computer. Either way if it has a decent gpu then 8 hours a day will make it last three times as Long as a gpu mining 24 hours a day....... so it’s still not a bad idea

Hahaha no no. I’m buying a phone for $1000 tax included, making payments over a year, then at the end of the year recouping my payments I made and more by selling the phone locally for around $700 so no eBay fees or anything. Then buying a new phone on Black Friday and getting on average $250 in gift cards. Sure ok I spend $50 a year total on my phone but I don’t think that can be beaten haha

I have zero desire to customize. I only have like 6 apps not in a folder anyways. I don’t want anything on my screen haha, that’s as much customization as I would ever want.

I’m trying to be lighthearted, not mocking. If I had not included “lol” then I would have come across much more judgmental. So I think you can simmer down now. Plus I put any extra spending money into crypto through coinbase as well, so my “portfolio” probably looks pretty damn similar

Sure a p100d Tesla would not go unappreciated haha and a massive house with a 20 foot screen in my theater room sounds amazing but in all reality having a life free of major bills and 0 debt sounds happier than I could ever ask for.  I would be more than happy with a nicer trimmed VW TDi and a nice tv haha

The fact that I never have to type in my passcode on my computer if I’m wearing my Apple Watch is a beautiful thing. All of my text messages and emails and photos are synced seamlessly between my Mac and my watch and my phone. When I add, move, or delete an application on one of my Apple tv’s they all update instantly (a setting I chose). Android is a great phone, Apple is a great ecosystem. I’ll happily sacrifice adding widgets to my homescreen and choosing an app folder over an app drawer. My preference of course, but in the end there really isn’t a definitive better or worse when it comes to preferences

What computer tasks does an android do that mine doesn’t? On top of it I have Jump Remote Desktop connected to my dual xeon and a gigabit connection to that, so I can literally use a computer any time I want ahah.

Technically based on today’s market cap it would go up 13.15x so that’s like 657k. That would absolutely change my life allowing me to buy a nice home, set aside money for my kids college funds, pay off all my credit cards as well as pay off my wife’s car and buy myself a much needed new car. Having virtually no bills and no debt would mean no interest payments would allow me to put enough savings aside to retire much earlier than currently planned. How could this not be life changing? lol

@_date: 2018-05-15 19:36:27
Yah I have a dual xeon plex server with 25tb of storage.  Totally agree with Bluetooth. I don’t wear anything besides my AirPods anymore. Get the biggest iPhone and then every year pay it off and then get a new phone. Every year I pay off my phone for about $500 and sell it for around $650. Couple this with the Black Friday discount and gift card I get and I get a free phone every year and it’s always the biggest best model and my net cost is $0. iPhones tend to hold their value much better than android at least as far as I have seen.
About photos that’s a whole other beast. My photos don’t really ever have those issues as my phone does things correct and the images metadata has the time date and geolocation of the photo. However my dad has had issues with incorrect dates and times. His problem ended up being that many of the photos were taken with an iPad that was Wifi only. Copying photos from Mac to windows should be seamless and makes no sense for it not to be. Only idea I might have in that one is some Live Photo’s not copying or something unique in that aspect.

Two things, first you are stating that the main benefit of android over iOS is the ability for a niche market to program their arduinos. Which seems laughable to me. Second, I know very little about this but it seems as if you have a raspberry pi you can program your arduino with iOS. Sure this is an extra $25 to do or whatever but it seems as if it is possible.
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:26:57
I mean yah, I have nothing that draws me to an android hhaha I’m always open to pursuasion,  but the main two reasons people give is customization and using google assistant over Siri, other than that, what’s the big sales pitch for me ahha. Honest question by the way

I paid for one initially. Since then my net cost has been 0. This has been over four years now in a row so I’m sorry if this upsets you but it’s true, taking advantage of high resell values and Black Friday deals it’s 100% possible. Nobody in my family believed me until I showed them it works.

Apple is boring but I think it just looks so much cleaner haha. I just prefer all my apps to have the same shape�� and then I can’t stand widgets on my home screen too. Android has some strengths for sure but if I had it I would modify the UI to look like Apple if possible ahha

Why is that bitcoin mountain?
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:19:28
I would say short term it’s really safe. It’s had a little dip the last few days and has been bouncing off 10k multiple times, it will break through 10k sound and probably blast through to 11k-12k. Sell some then and you will be pretty happy.

That’s awesome man, however if it’s just making it look how you want, I would choose the faster more powerful phone and get one free every year over making it looks different. My preference though, and your preference is android, can’t judge someone on that haha
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:01:09
I would trust coinbase and Gemini. I believe Gemini insures your money as well and I feel like the winklevoss bros would do things right since they are pushing so hard for crypto to be legitimized. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 21:50:49
Because he asked how many own a full bitcoin. So no more than 17.6 since that’s how many bitcoin have been created. However the number is far less since like he said, many people own more than one.

Get a free new one every year. Why would I turn down the fastest phone on the market when it’s free. But the phone on Black Friday and get a $300 gift card. After one year, pay the remainder of the phone off, and sell it. You will always get more than you paid it off for. Free phones for life.

@_date: 2018-10-30 01:46:44
He may or may not have good ideas. But he’s a complete jerk.
@_date: 2018-10-30 02:16:36
He seems to be intentionally confusing people listing bitcoin cash as the “bitcoin” and further confusing things calling bitcoin “bitcoin Core” or whatever. I think he should embrace his coin and run with it rather than trying to take over the bitcoin name. I got nothing against bitcoin cash and they can do whatever they want.  Just call it what it is. That’s all
@_date: 2018-10-30 02:11:39
I just can’t stand to even here him speak anymore haha. He’s a smart guy but he is so incredibly arrogant that only his opinion matters. He’s not bitcoin god. He doesn’t have every perfect answer to every problem lol

@_date: 2018-06-24 03:07:46
I got in before it hit 20k, almost a year ago actually. When I got in it was like 5500 and it dropped to 3500 when China announced exchanges were illegal or whatever, and that kinda sucked, then it went from 3500 to 20k in like 3 months haha. Seeing it rise so fast and then fall so fast wasn’t surprising. It sucks since I did put money in when it was going up and didn’t pull it out fast enough as it went down, but I bought in with everything I feel comfortable spending when it was between 6500-7500, so I’m not super worried. I know bitcoin isn’t dead and I believe in it enough that it’s completely a long term hold for me unless it shoots ip to 20k again super fast, then I’ll cash out early and watch it drop haha.
@_date: 2019-08-22 16:58:36
Damnit. Haha I almost posted about bitcoin as well, but chose “60tb of hard drive storage” hahaha
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:13:44
I mean I never stated it was natural, and don’t think it was. However that doesn’t mean it can’t happen again naturally or unnaturally. It’s a fact that it hit 20k no matter how it happened. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:31:05
Yeah i trade against Btc only as well. I put 0.1 btc into trading like 10 days ago and now I’m at 0.138. Cant complain about that.
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:45:55
Gotcha. Not a bad idea. For me it’s szabos bit gold and a number of other things that make me believe it’s him. There’s a book called the age of cryptocurrency that goes pretty in depth about how it’s very likely szabo or that he was at least the main guy behind it with help from others. That sold me lol

See I’m ok with 3% because I’ve made 41% more bitcoin in the last 9 days from trading sooooooooooo yeah. 3% barely impacts my bottom line.

@_date: 2018-06-24 05:49:21
I believe coinbase has also been hiring like crazy and is literally doubling the size of their company. This is for improving customer support and adding more services. Give it time and stop being salty about a company who offers a pretty great product as is. 
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:51:41

@_date: 2019-10-28 05:01:26
Been around for over two years. Listened to hundreds of podcasts and read multiple books. Mined bitcoin as well as numerous altcoins. Sure, there are plenty of scam altcoins but that doesn’t make every coin available on Coinbase a scam. Been fairly successful in trading as well. Out of the coins I’ve bought and held, I’m up more with my altcoins than I am with bitcoin. 80% of my portfolio is our lord and savior however. As with anything, I recommend u/doctorblumpkin (great name btw) does his research into each and every coin prior to throwing any money at it. Plenty of projects deserve support, and plenty of money to be made in other coins.
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:37:42
Curious.... say I buy bitcoin, sell it and buy more doing some trading, but I never cash out to my bank account. It all stays within the exchanges system. Could I get away with claiming I didn’t realize any gains? Happy to pay my taxes when I owe them, but I haven’t felt like I’ve actually made any money as I have no seen that money in my account. Just in some virtual account.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:10:18

Am I really shilling them? I’m expressing an opinion sure, but not every opinion is a shill. I have had a total of 0 issues with them in all of my use over the past ten months since I got into crypto. I have made 30+ purchases of crypto through their service as well as selling crypto and transferring it back to my bank. It’s all been within reasonable amounts of time. I particularly have enjoyed free transfers from gdax allowing me to make on chain transactions for free. I think you need to take a big breath and take a chill pill and maybe an exlax because you obviously got something going on dude (I realize you may be being overly obnoxious on purpose and if that’s so then good for you, you got me��)

@_date: 2017-11-28 06:20:20
It’s hit 10k on several exchanges. Cex.io, and okcoin are two that I have seen other than golix
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:05:44
I’m going to pull out my initial investment between now and it hitting 17k or so. If I get my initial investment out then I’ll ride it out until I pull out entirely. I don’t believe for a second that it’s not gonna crash back down to a certain level. But the beautiful thing is that we have the halving next year so if it crashes back to 4000 again, it won’t be for long

One thing I don’t remember is if she said “it’s used for drugs” or if she said “it’s use is for drugs”. Maybe she understood it was a potential payment platform but saw that much of its current use at the time was Silk Road type things, or if she was blinded and jaded and only saw it as drug money. I have no idea. It was just one of those things she mentioned mostly in passing that went in one year and out the other and then was reminded of it 5 years later haha,

Bitcoin Cash was hitting a block almost every single
Minute because there was nearly all the hash power going towards it instead of bitcoin. Then the difficulty adjusted and it went from $45 a day down to $7 a day per miner so now it’s more profitable to mine bitcoin again. High difficult and Low miner count means no blocks found

No that’s not true. They can mine empty blocks and since they are the only ones mining it they will get every block reward, so if it was somehow bitcoin they would be making 12.5 bitcoin every ten minutes. Since their chain would be the longest chain the old chain everyone else was mining on would be invalidated

Because that’s malicious and people would be upset and leave the pool, as well as that would hurt the crypto market overall since all crypto is no longer safe and why would I want my money in crypto then? All it would do is hurt everyone. Now if someone wants to kill crypto this is one avenue that would help that, but finding 51% of the hashing power that all of a sudden decides they don’t want to make money anymore and want to attack crypto is a tall order

Transactions don’t get harder and more expensive as the blockchain grows longer. They get harder / more expensive as there is more use. If we expected bitcoin to be the overall world currency today it wouldn’t happen. But with segwit being implemented and LN coming online soon we have advances that are kicking th can down the road so to speak. Eventually we may get to a point that it can process all transactions cheaply..... but that’s not today.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:47:57
Hahaha I mean I’m not a snowflake by any means. I’m saying it’s really not realistically possible unless someone wants to crash the whole market. That doesn’t make me overly sensitive or butthurt over every little thing.

If someone is able to maliciously steal coins by having 51%  and mining empty blocks on your fake blockchain you are effectively invalidating any and all of the security and benefits that come from blockchain. Now this probably wouldn’t be a big deal if it was a small coin no one has heard of, but if this happened to any in the top 50, I think the whole market would crash.

@_date: 2017-10-31 16:12:01
there is nothing wrong with buy ing right now. right now is always the right time. after the split if a second coin is created its expected to drop in value significantly so dont be expecting to hole two coins worth 6k+ but if you own a full bitcoin and get a full 2x coin then you might get a couple hundred bucks out of it.

I don’t hate it. I hate the people behind it. Bitcoin cash is fine. They can do whatever’s they want with their coin. I would prefer if people weren’t able to just fork a coin and use the name bitcoin since that’s just playing off Bitcoins success but it’s whatever. What I hate is that all the folks over at BCH call their coin bitcoin and the true bitcoin as determined by general consensus they call bitcoin core. This is just intentional manipulation on their part to trick people into buying BCH instead of the real thing.

Lol you don’t seem to understand the point of blockchain. The beauty is that anyone can create it, it doesn’t have to actually have monetary value to be extremely useful, granted if you changed the word blockchain to cryptocurrency you aren’t super far off. There are far more coins than their needs to be and we could get by with significantly less. But you can’t just say screw blockchain when you are really talking about crypto currencies.

Ever four years the block reward cuts in half so less bitcoin created. Less new bitcoin coming into the market means increased scarcity. Last halving was 2016 which helped lead to the meteoric rise in 2017.  When block rewards cut in have again from 12.5 to 6.125, scarcity will further increase

Probably will be. Things will get interesting 8 months to a year after the next halving.
