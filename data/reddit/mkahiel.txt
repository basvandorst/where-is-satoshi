It wasn't randomly generated, but it was complex. i used it before with Chrome and IE on the PC with no issues. Roboform uses one password to encrypt all other passwords for sites. which is not a bad idea as SSO, however it doesn't integrate with Safari or browsers installed on IPAD similar to Roboform for Windows.

The weird  thing, i never got any email from mt.gox when depositing, selling or withdraw. is this normal? my setting is to send email for each action.

I have Yubikey bought from Yubikey... I couldn't use it with Mt?Gox. 
i was using their web site to sell, using my IPAD. any connection here? Also, i live in Canada, is it also not possible to withdraw Canadian. Thanks guys.

Yes, this is why you need to move BitCoins to another public address not published.

if i am using secure pc, ssl and username/password, now they need 2fA? tomorrow will make it 3factor Auth. and so, on. Also, with other exchanges now you need to register the browser and pc to allow access to your account. which isn't a bad idea, as the confirmation is using email.

You don't have to! Each wallet can hold many public addresses. You can send from wallet all at once or any amount. Wallet and BitCoin network will manage the transfer.

This hurts a lot. i had similar experience and i know how bad you feel.

I've just lost all my money and BTC with MT.Gox. After i put a limit sale order. somehow, all the money reused to buy BiTCoins and all All tranfered to nother wallet. I got no email confirmation, as per my settings. And all these steps took only 20 seconda. It seems either their system is hacked or they have an issue. They only replied back showing me my transaction history which i didn't approve. They never replied back to any email or ticket. I geel so frustrated. Lost around 3 BTC but learned my lession the hard way. 
The most riskiest part of BitCoin is when you interact with an exchange or leave a wallet online. Any thoughts?

it has a great value.. you just didn't get it. There is no BitCoin police or authority ... you lose money with an exchange or someone. the police will say what is bitcoin?

i made two transactions from the same computer, same browser same everything at the same time almost, one with mt.gox and another one with another exchange. lost all my money with mt.gox while the other is perfect. it seems mt.gox is targeted with more clever hackers. or their security has a big flaws. i suspect the later.

It depends on VM configuration. This is why there are new versions of virus dedication software called "Streaming scanners" these scan data stream in and out the host even before reaching the vm.

i am a Canadian and at one time decided to send few BTC s to MT.Gox to sell for higher price. 
i put a sale for .5 BtC and after few seconds, sale is done, then bought again then all my BTC transferred to another wallet. 
i emailed them immediately, and transaction was not confirmed. they replied quick and told them i haven't authorize the withdraw. Anyway,  i lost around $3000. ALL my wallet.
after weeks of waiting, they said, transaction was done with correct username and password, so they aren't responsible. 
I was using tablet Ipad, so less malware and viruses. https. 
tell now i still don't know how this happened,  but i will never deal with them again. 
I am happy with CaVirTex.
