Can't remember the email or any of the information that I would've used!
I keep thinking, but I made up all new stuff then and lost all the information.

Yes, it's like gambling with possibilities. The lurking will continue...thanks.

Thanks for the advice, I feel LTC will take a while longer unless bitcoin encounters trouble that doesn't shit it down entirely.
This could include becoming HUGE and other business wanting in on the money. 
If it moves to a 10bn market cap, it would be somewhere around 1000-1500 a coin, no?

Well, I assume that before I move it to a new wallet or my desktop or offline or something, it's just sitting in that first account with the exchanger, mtgox. 
In the account I made recently you can see the balance "
    Your wallet:
    0.00000000 BTC "
Theoretically, if I made an order, and forgot all the information, my account is just sitting there with the bitcoins, correct? As long as it's not hacked/stolen/lost.
That's the only thing I'm hoping, the rest is that I could actually find the transaction and thus provide a kind of start of proof of purchase.

I like that.

This is the MEEK inheriting the EARTH.
Think about it.

Yea this would probably change things a bit.

Thanks, I've seen you around, I think this is all very interesting and didn't even understand what the bitcointip system was until literally just now. With diversity and ease of use like this, bitcoin HAS to catch on unless it becomes down-regulated by making it more difficult and possibly "illegal". Even though, we all know that would be all too ironic for the people who seemingly misplaced and miss-spent trillions of dollars to want to take action about currency regulations.

Why would it belong to them? Did something happen a while ago where they had to shut down or something?
I was assuming it would just be lost on their online account and I would have to prove that I bought that particular transaction with my credit card. 
Couldn't I prove that....but only with their help? 
My question: Would the website keep history of the credit card transaction and the personal wallet that was used to make the account and buy said coins with? It would have to be connected to the credit card no? Or is it too anonymous...

If he did it earlier, he'd be a multi-millionaire. He'll notice an increase, but slower than the earlier rise.

What if your best friend convinced you not to buy in when they were 1309 for 1USD.

So basically bitcoin is going to be the strongest out of any alternate because of the ability to dissect a bitcoin to many decimal points? Lot's of this will then be a waiting game, if anything is possible at lower investment amounts with larger turnovers, for the next lowest cycle.
As I read previously, I think 250 might be the new max "low".
