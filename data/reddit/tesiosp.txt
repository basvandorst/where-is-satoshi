They are pretty much trying to "adapt" to cryptos, but I bet we're going to see Visa/MasterCard based crypto debit cards...

This ETF manipulation is nothing but scam. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:20:03
After all these assets you choose to short squeeze btc...
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:42:48
You make it. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 09:42:51
Well first of all its not friends fault that the guy sold bitcoins for $500. He asked for specific amount, got specific amount and paid back that specific amount with interest on it. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:49:47
Sooo, should i sell or sell? 
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:13:51
Man really?
@_date: 2018-08-03 09:36:12
Toddler who can speak can explain all these graphs... if you regret buying bitcoin just get lost and sell it whenever.

How do you "forget" your password to a 500k account? 
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:51:06
Just re-bought my btc at 6700, the next couple of days it slid to around 5000.
Wouldnt suggest looking at the price much. Just waaaaaait.

@_date: 2018-07-31 13:03:09
Wow thats cheap. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:27:46
Where I live, those kind of custom plates cost around $10k, idk how thata in the US, but ye, probably costs money. 
Or its probably from one of those phony marketing teams who knock on your door talking about one and real bitcoin and how millionaires are making billions from some 20 year old harward student's futuristic algorithm.

Well i'm that stupid that i have $45,000 debt which i need to pay. And i lost my job so i had to use my assets to pay loan interest. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:04:18
To be honest, if you want to make money, now you can trade for at least 6% daily profit just by buying and selling btc. Oh and i dont advertise any trading company
@_date: 2018-12-19 11:51:09

@_date: 2018-12-19 16:19:37
