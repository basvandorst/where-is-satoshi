i honestly don't know if i could have done the same. an extra thousand bucks would mean i could get the rest of my teeth pulled instead of just one every month. i don't know if i could have that much money and choose to spend another 6 months in agony.

15 year old gives back 60 grand, that might possibly have been 6 million in a couple years...
so much more than a hero man, far far stronger than i could have been.

damn dude, no need to be a jerk. i made my mistakes in the past and i'm paying for them now. must be nice to feel self righteous when you can afford to give, and haven't made any bad decisions in your life.

dammit man, i'm probably going to lose my house soon, this thread was my last great hope.

i would get into bitcoins if i could just understand how it works. not the generating, but the wallet thing. how do you just send bitcoins to someone by typing it on reddit? how do i access my bitcoins to spend, all that stuff? when they are mined and you get some that way, what kind of account do they go into and how to you even set up an account like that?
it's like my brain can't make critical connections between the info on the bitcoin page...

man i've been researching it for weeks and i can't figure it out. apparently it's just numbers. if someone tipped me bitcoins i wouldn't even know how to go about accessing them to spend or save or whatever.

oh i'm not looking for charity, i'm just saying if i stumbled onto that kind of luck i don't think i could pay it back. i might could though, it would depend on whether or not i had any painkillers left from my last trip to the dentist and how bad i was hurting that day.
