Is this a joke? Why would a BU dev suggest the 21 million coin limit was not important.  I thought that was one of the biggest benefits and advantages of Bitcoin when compared to fiat money. These BU guys are getting more and more crazy as time goes on.

That's all I could learn from a message just now on the core-dev IRC.  Hopefully we'll be hearing more about this in the coming months.

So next thing we will be hearing is "OMG blocks are full".  We need to use BU ASAP.

Thanks for your answer. Do you have any ideas as to what may be in the pipeline and what we can look forward to having in perhaps the next few months? How about sidechains?

But with the number of servers they are planning can I assume it will still be usable  functional with that BIP you mention?

More probably Roger Rabbit

Roger has been introduced as Bitcoin Jesus a few times.  Andreas is like a saint compared with Roger who it seems could not care less about the future of bitcoin and is interested only in short term fame and money.  It's sad that we have people like Roger involved in bitcoin but I think at least by now everyone realizes the kind of person he is and what he stands for.

Thanks for your response. What is needed for trustless sidechains to become a reality?

Have you ever heard of the words pump and dump?  Where do you think all the coins like Steem end up.  The gutter comes to mind :-)
@_date: 2016-11-07 04:35:04
Here we go again ;-)   haha this thing then leads to the headline bitcoin will be dead.  Heard it all before too many times.

Roger Ver:  The new Bitcoin terrorist 
@_date: 2016-11-07 04:37:42
Does this require a change to the bitcoin protocol and if so then when could that happen?
@_date: 2016-11-07 04:36:42
FUD post from Roger's boys again?

You're very correct. Some of the articles coming out of there are more like what you'd expect on r/btc.  Makes me wonder who pays to have those articles published.

Sorry but your post is total bullshit. Maybe some will believe what you are saying but I doubt it.  Give us all a break and give up posting this rubbish!
