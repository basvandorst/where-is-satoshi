I think Satoshi Nakamoto is Mark Zuckerberg. I have been putting a bit of thought into this and it kinda make sense. 
He is an idealist, a philanthropist and has studied psychology. Also he is a genius coder with previous experience in changing the world.
He is an Otaku which could explain why he chose a Japanese nickname and maybe the initials are a hint. Satoshi Nakamoto = S.N. = Social Network.
Big stretch. Big coincidence. I don't know if the website supposed to reveal his identity is legit but I assume that these "people" have the same theory. Because why would they choose May 14th to reveal his identity? This is precisely Mark Zuckerberg's birthday. He is going to be 35.
That's a lot of coincidence.

Because you don't want or because you know who Satoshi actually is?

Well the thing is if it's him it would also make total sense why he wanted to be anonymous.

I understand why you say that. But I think the way Facebook has become wasn't his original intention. I think he is a disruptor and idealist but maybe he had to pretend he was like any other rich successful guy. 
He was playing their game otherwise they would have stopped him. 
Also I think he realized Facebook wasn't enough to change the world. So that's why he had the idea of Bitcoin and realized that his name would have to be dissociated from his creation

Well we could then say that Bitcoin, despite having a noble purpose is still until now mostly used for speculation and therefore to generate money so it would sort of has his signature according to your statement, no?

Really? I know he dropped out but I thought it was still his field of expertise.

Hahaha yeah it's true. I could elaborate more but I'm too lazy to do so. Guess we'll find out on May 14th. But it's probably going to be another bullshit.

Hahahahaha. They are going to have another lawsuit. ^^

Yeah it seems unlikely after rethinking it but in a way it would be a great funny twist like you said.

Thank you! Well it looks like it's definitely a very unpopular opinion and I can see why? It would be a bit upsetting if it were true.
I believe it would cause a moderate dump for a while. People would probably lose faith. But then realize that it doesn't change the fundamentals of Bitcoin at all and come back.

Yes. What you say sounds accurate but this website with the countdown is throwing me off. They chose his brithday to reveal Satoshi's identity. It can't be a coincidence. So it could be that some bad actors want to spread a false rumor to see the market correct or something.
