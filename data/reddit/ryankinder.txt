Ha! I swear I was making a joke that even .025 is worth a lot these days. I didn't expect you to do it. Now I will give you a month of Reddit gold by paying with Bitcoin to even the score. Lol!
Submit all prompts! I created one based on bitcoin a month or so back and got some good responses.
Edit: wow, that was easy to pay for reddit gold with bitcoin. My first time doing it!
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:21:15
Just made my first ever purchase with bitcoin. So much fun.
@_date: 2014-01-26 10:34:20
Can you explain further? I am new to cryptocurrencies and I don't know how best to avoid scams.
@_date: 2014-01-26 04:31:33
Difficult? I find it easy. First I did a transaction online with someone. Then I traded cash in person via localbitcoins.

I feel in this thread and the others, people are taking the charges and accepting them at face value. Innocent until proven guilty. Wait until the proof is fully out there, otherwise all charges are alleged.

After seeing how much gold was given in this thread, reddit will want to celebrate every extra 5,000 subscribers. XD

For those unaware, what is replicant and what are the benefits to it?
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:54:20
Thanks for the response.  I agree after reading the full transcripts of his conversations that it does not look good.
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:16:21
Well the fact he cc'd the chief financial officers with the stories I linked about Overstocks success has me upbeat too.
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:23:03
Golden showers. Now the lounge will be flowing in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:18:32
I suddenly desire sheets.

Interesting, Litecoin is around this value currently.
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:03:02
Not sure how to edit out my email address, but I was able to crop out my info at least. Ipads suck for editing.

Reply to this comment once you're ready with vert so I can place an order. I do reviews for the vertcoin community of merchants. :)
@_date: 2014-01-26 03:58:11
Wtf is "nxt"?
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:27:28
Most excellent! Order made. Can't wait. :)
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:57:03
It was a jest, good sir. He was trying to highlight that big banks get away with much more shenanigans with far less scrutiny.
@_date: 2014-01-26 04:11:25
That is awesome of you. Keep spreading the gospel!
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:19:28
How much did that many cost?
@_date: 2014-01-23 03:48:01
I am confused by what you mean. I can screen shot his reply where he said it was "Under review!" But it was a two word response. Lol. You can email him yourself as well John.Legere ... He really does respond, and rather promptly during business hours. Unless it is underlings replying.

A few questions: how difficult was it to start accepting Bitcoin? Can you update us how well it does? How do returns work with purchases via bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-26 10:27:42
I think it is good to have a healthy dose of caution. User went through a few questions in a previous thread made by and concluded he was indeed a 15 year old who gave a lecture in class about bitcoin.
Being the investigative person I am, I checked out how much he gave away so far in the thread OP was linking to. He gave away precisely $40.20. Of course, that number will drop based on some people not signing up with the bitcoin bot. Still, that is a reasonable sum for awareness and even if two people in that thread get invested in bitcoin seriously it is a net gain. (The caveat here is that he was tipped $50 by one person in that thread and a few other tips... $8.52 in this thread. I think, though, even if he does make any money from spreading awareness, he deserves it for the amount of effort he is putting out there.)
Edit: and just out of a fair bit of insomnia I checked out the transaction history comments from bitcointip and he has been given at least $72.54. Let's say all $40.20 was accepted that he gave away. That would mean $32.54 left. Even if he kept it, the amount of hustle for such a small gain on his end is worth the awareness.

I am so envious of the pounds money symbol. The US dollar symbol looks boring in comparison.
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:12:26
Thank you for your prompt responses and thanks for giving me my first ever internet tip. My mother uses ecigs and her birthday is coming up, so I know where my business will be going.
@_date: 2014-12-10 02:26:01
Man, Latin is hard. One word has multiple meanings with one of the meanings being incredibly specific to reddit. I didn't even know they had upvotes back then!
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:20:59
I am confused. Screen shots aren't proof of what? I did get a response and my screen shot proves it. I am not some day old reddit account looking to trick someone.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:12:12
Yknow, after reading this thread I think has it right by hand approving all withdrawals lol
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:14:56
That's not how reddit works.
@_date: 2014-01-26 04:27:40
Thanks again! We are running a writing contest with bitcoin as a payout option. I hope you consider entering. :)
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:06:06
Where can I find a big easy to press BUY button?
@_date: 2014-01-12 13:14:21
I was thinking he should do that on the roof and that the driveway should have the full address written out.
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:22:03
It took a year and a half for the sub I founded to get to 50k. It is hard to climb to the six digits.
@_date: 2014-01-26 03:57:05
Please. Please demonstrate with me. Even .025. Please. Please? ;)
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:29:47
It would be awesome.  when I bought reddit gold for someone a while ago with bitcoin, at the time  it was almost a half dollar higher than buying it with usd.
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:56:33
Sorry, I didn't want to offend anyone with my enthusiasm.  :/
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:48:52
When will the Federal Reserve finally fork the US dollar?
