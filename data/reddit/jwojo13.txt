How is discussing the bitcoin community &amp; its relationship to the price/future of bitcoin off topic?

When I see leaders and well known BTC/BCH thinkers making fun of each other and yelling like babies in public, it makes me want to diversify my coins. Which I’ve done. Because I don’t think you can trust BTC if the people helping run the show are arrogant or childish. 
You said “no holds barred.” Often, in wrestling, holds were barred because certain moves led to injury. So, in this instance, when we see leaders acting like this, people get hurt... when they believe that there are “no holds barred,” we will see money prioritized over people and injuries will occur.
And that’s not my moon. In terms of “moons,” this is not where I want to go. I don’t want to go to a moon where money is king and we’re all a rude bunch of babies.
That’s why I started this conversation. To see if there are others.

Awkward.

I actually typically find myself on his side... but that was unprofessional. I guess one of the benefits of being in the crypto space is that we don’t have to be professional to be successful... but it can’t hurt, eh?

That entire debate was ....awful... to watch. Neither side looked good at the end.

He definitely deserved a hefty amount of criticism here. But the other guy.. "BCash, BCash, BCash" at the end? That was... also oddly childish.

Haha. Excellent point. Thanks for discussing with civility. Good luck on getting to your moon!

...how is this off topic?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:33:38
But the way that the conversation is being held... it's terrible. None of our wallets will look great when CNN starts reporting that leaders in the Bitcoin world are name calling, flipping each other off, and acting like children.

I guess. It just makes me want to diversify a bit more. “No holds barred” leads to lots of injuries. That’s not my moon.
