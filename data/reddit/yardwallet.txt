The bitcoins will be escrowed into a 2-of-3 multisig address which is generated by 3 keys. One is held by the seller, one by the buyer, the last by our platform. 
We will have reputation for sellers and later on we may be open to 3rd party escrow business.

Thanks for your suggestions. 
We have tried the mentioned projects and the main process of trading bitcoin is similar. But our market will be based on YardWallet, a HD mobile bitcoin wallet where people can hold their coins at usual time. And it's more convenient for the traders to get notifications and escrow bitcoins with the app when a trade is started. People can trade bitcoins at any time and any place with their smart phones.

Yeah. Traders only need to escrow bitcoins after a trade is started in the new market and the coins won't be controlled only by the platform. People can trade bitcoins in cash or with other online payments as they wish.

It's different. With coinfeinne both the buyer and the seller need to deposit some bitcoins as a guarantee in the trade. In YardWallet we will use multisig escrow that the seller, the buyer and the platform can jointly control the bitcoins as guarantee.
