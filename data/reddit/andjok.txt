I don't think they'd do returns in bitcoin, since they'd probably just immediately convert them to USD at point of purchase.

Because it would be nice to be able to accept both bitcoins and fiat currency until bitcoin becomes mainstream.

That is so neat!  I love the idea of being able to trap mice and let them outside easily.  If I ever have a mouse problem I'll be sure to get some of these.

Cashintocoins.com let me get bitcoin the same day I deposited the cash.  You basically have to go to a certain bank to deposit the cash to get the amount of bitcoin you request, then email a picture of the receipt and they send you the bitcoins.

Cashintocoins.com is pretty fast, I got my BTC in less than a day.

The difference is that you can still choose not to pay for cable. Even if you have cable and choose to stop paying for it, they don't come forcibly take money from you.  They just stop providing service to you.
Also, you can get satellite TV, but that's sort of off-topic I suppose.

For real, I just bought my first bitcoins a little over a week ago and it's already been a roller coaster for me haha.
