As i have posted in your thread I will be willing to pool but only if you reduce your rate down to 3% (this is actually a fair amount for myself considering i would have to get flights to sign the contract and any tax implications from this)
As also stated if he chooses to go the pooled side i will be willing to put $50,000 up in USD not AUD.  But only at a 3% fee

Editing your post to save face now are you? you said that they lost your money and its because they were watching porn "jacking off"
So thanks for making me look like a troll maybe just have the balls to stand by your original statements

If you are willing i would be happy to go 1/2 in this bet with you as i have also said I am happy to take this bet up.
That way it would be easier for you considering the fiat side.  The only problem for myself is i am in australia so if you are able to travel to meet him and do the contract's I would be happy to give a 2-3% extra cut to yourself for handling the red tape.  Which we can discuss further if interested.

There they are Found them that wasn't hard.
Now how they work is they trade on the margins so to speak.  As in they have an account on Bitstamp (i think) and they buy from them and then resell them to there american clients at a slightly higher rate.
So they will follow the exchanges to a degree but also they have a internal center where you can send them your bitcoins for sale and hence they will resell these coins at a higher price which is also what helps to dislocate the price from any 1 exchange as they have there own orderbook internally.
Hope that helps

I will be willing to put up $50 000 only if your cut is reduced down to 3% at most.

I will take the bet so long as your happy with someone who is not in USA taking the bet.
I am Australian based and have sufficient escrow to ensure my end of the deal.
Who would you be wanting to use as escrow?
