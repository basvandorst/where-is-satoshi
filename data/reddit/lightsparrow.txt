Deja vu

It’s less of art inspired by bitcoin and more so art inspired by the word blockchain. 
even then I could see some more potential to make the chain more “blocky”
But kudos on the hard work! Any art is to be celebrated

Draw me in one of your comics. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:31:24
So even though he only sent .83, all 30k moves ?
Also, is the entire purpose of moving it to account C, to create confusion as to how much you sent?
I thought the whole purpose was transparency 
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:07:41
I see, thanks for the clarification.  
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:50:55
Maybe I don’t understand how payment works, but when he was paying with his BTC why did he type in 30,000 coins instead of typing the .83 he owed ?
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:53:36
Different peeps but I def will also !

I guess it’s signaling that trading has the potential to bring more gains than just hodling, but at the cost of a bumpy road. But it also has the potential to bring major losses. 
So technically it should show two flags in the trade box. One way up and one way below the starting line.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:59:56
Nope, not the point. It was just a message about how much money he has.  The whole point is that he could, not wether or not he would.  
You have a good one too!
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:33:26
Half a million at The peak.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:10:54
Oh no, I’m just talking about how much money he has.  Where did you get I said he hadn’t bought any bitcoin?
He definitely has bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:32:52
Nah that’s a part of a greater statement which was 


It doesn’t really say anything about when he bought bitcoin, but more to how much cash he has.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:36:12
Nope, no implications. Just a statement about how much money he has.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:47:51
Whoops, didn’t read a word of that.  
Again, have a good day.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:15:59
Nope, it didn’t imply anything beyond how much money he had.
Have a good day.
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:44:33
Uhhhh no lol there were almost 2 billion people on earth 100 years ago
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:26:06
Oh, nah it was just a statement about how much money he has.
Whether zuck has 0 bitcoin or 1 million bitcoin, my statement still could hold true.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:51:06
Again, have a good day.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:51:02
“He is inspired by bitcoin” that can be interpreted several different ways.
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:31:51
I like the intent but it just reads as “ITS TIME FOR PLAN!”
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:55:57
Zuck has so much money he could match how much bitcoin the twins have if he bought in now probably.
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:21:24
Well that’s bull. There’s plenty more scarce items.  My grandma makes a delicious apple turnover. But only once a year for Christmas. That’s way more scarce.
@_date: 2019-04-21 04:13:05
Oh interesting.  Okay thanks for clearing that up. 
So on chain transactions have no fee but have a block size limit ?  What makes a blocksize bigger? The larger purchases or something ?
@_date: 2019-04-21 02:59:08
What’s the difference between a standard wallet and a lightning network wallet? For BTC noobs
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:01:01
Not the Great Depression. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 08:27:03
Why is he against bitcoin though? Didn’t he make his money off it
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:26:31
Unreliable how? If I make a wallet with that site is it somehow compromised ?
@_date: 2018-12-30 07:54:02
As someone new to all this, is bitcoin . com something he runs and that is unreliable?
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:51:08
Okay, got it. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:48:36
We still talking about bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-21 07:59:40
Love the ‘HODL’ tattoo
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:06:17
Is that bull having sex with the bear ?
@_date: 2018-12-30 11:25:42
Interesting. And the government wants bitcoin gone because? Control?
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:50:36
They should just jump on board with bitcoin all the way
