More, almost nobody here uses gold and silver to be honest... 
The most used and common way is savingin USD cash, but then, the seccond most common way to save money sure is BTC...
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:50:23
your point of view is pretty accurate indeed, and indeed things like food, water, and guns and ammo would help in this crisis! is not a secret that in venezuela there is a high gun control, so nobody can have access to firearms to deffend themselves... 
and indeed as you think, bitcoin helps some, but some doesn't, as indeed, when crisis ends, there will be a mass adoption of bitcoin, for now, most of people, even me, are worried about getting food, and fresh water
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:25:40
i'll investigate mlre futher and see if there is something already done to actually help people in here with that
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:19:54
i can backup this comment and say that is actually true.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:29:47
you think i haven't thinked about this a lot? that i am under suffering for a desicion made by others...
btw my mom and my dad never supported chavez, but i still get your point, but what that have to do with me? i should not be suffering because of the desicions made by others when i were just a kid
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:07:41
that's an interesting website, i haven't seen it before, is interesting to see that there is an actual webpage where they track the actual inflation and you can even see it in a graphic, interesting material indeed.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:31:51
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:33:49
There is private property, but since chavez came up, the goverment mains target to attack is the private property, more than 1/3 of the private property have already flee the country or have been expropiated  arbitrarily, and i think because the hyperinflation, banks doesn't even gives  mortgage  lmao... at least as long as i know
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:15:29
Thanks dude! appreciate the support
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:39:25
lets not mention the 4 military that were brutally killed that day because of the incompetent of Guaido
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:40:08
ACtually ethereum is more likely to be used, since in [localethereum.com]( the fees are lower, also dash have become pretty popular in here!
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:17:49
between 6.000 and 20.000 dollars... sometimes if it is in a poor place, it could cost even a lot less!
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:18:52
well i don't do transactions daily at all! not even every week,  but to give you an aswer, for big amounts, BTC, and for small amounts, ETH because small fees, other coins are not too much used since ETH and BTC are the easiest to exchange to the local currency
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:28:24
what's up with my Grammar?
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:57:14
the fees sure are a problem, that's why most of the times instead of exchanging the amount for the day, people is more likely to exchange a lil bit more, and buying US dollars in cash, to have it on hand in a easier way to exchange it for the local currency, instead of changing small amounts of BTC, because indeed fees are a problem in here, since every cent counts
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:36:33
im 23 years old, i live with my grandma, my aunt and my mom, somehow they rely on me, if i don't get the food for the house and my aunt and my mom doesn't manage to do it neither, we all have to starve together... for my luck, i don't have kids... it would be very irresponsible  from me having a kid knowing the situation i am living at, and how i cannot even take care of myself at all with this economic situation...
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:15:18
mostly of times security is included in the services, and services are also pretty cheap in here, the cost for a rich house like that, maybe long time ago were more money, but now i think you can get a house like a mansion for less than 100K of usd, and a rent here is between 20 USD to 100 USD, pretty cheap! maybe 120 usd like much to live in guataparo country club, because otherwise nobody would have money to pay for that
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:23:03
well yeah, petro succeded on that consciousness thing ofc, it kinda makes people more normal  to introduce to BTC indeed... thinking about that, in that phsicological way it actually helped a lot to introduce people
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:30:12
why don't you try asking me what i have been eathing the last week before calling me scum? easy to say for you
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:52:16
the most common payment method is Debit cards, since there is not cash in the money because of the hiperinflation, there is a big lack of cash... 
And the most usual wallets are those onine wallets who doesn't even need to download, as long as i know, i talk for my personal experience, because for example, i like to use Cryptonator.
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:11:22
soon there will be the technological revolution in the entire world, of course, even it bitcoin doesn't break the 20k from 2017, sure it have already make a lot of noise, and more now with the launching of Lybra, from facebook, eventually, bitcoin is the money that will change everything, and each day the change is even more closer
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:09:07
it is already proven that Petro isn't even a cryptocurrency, is just a scam used for this regime to wash money... besides there are some places where they recive Petros, its behavior is actually pretty weird... as long as i know, it is not even a cryptocurrency
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:29:44
i don't have a lightning adress, either i don't have a smartphone to have the app, but i have a BTC wallet, i hope it is allowed to post it in here, there you go:  
 **1MgzcgYneoPwtXmoVeMEfYeHiSjf4Rr5CE**   
feel free to send any amount, srly, any amount even if you consider it too small, would be helpfull for me to eat well and even to leave the country, right now im saving money to go to colombia, where i can work for a wage that could actually help me to live, without having to be taking risk investments to survive, and maybe having to do it as an option
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:18:24
Yes, im using a Pentium laptop with 2gb of ram
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:49:42
Indeed cash USD(Euro not too much) is much more used to save money instead of bitcoin, but the thing is that there is people who have fiat money in USD, for easy usage, and the rest of their money in BTC... and indeed there is each day more people using BTC to save money because of the profits it could give just because of how bullish it is at this moments
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:21:54
i don't think localbitcoins will share my information, i have seen people in localbitcoins with a volume of 300 bitcoins and living here in venezuela! so, me that doens't have almost anything, why would i worry about that?
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:45:03
Uuuh, why you assume that i voted for it... i was only 5 years old when chavez came up to power, and im just 23 years old now, and i haven't voted never in my entire life...  Also, maybe my country did and i stayed, but tell me what would i do when i was 19 years old and knowing that i had to flee, but without any paperworks ready, and any money? 
And thinking that if the case that i were a kid that could not help, i should stay to fight, is fucking stupid, you don't have any idea of how risky is to protest today, military have right to kidnape, torture, rape, kill... you're just too ignorant to understand how fucked up are the  young people like me, also there is no guns for citizens, fighting guns with stones gets you more likely to get killed... sorry but i have to be honest with you, you just don't know what are you talking about at all
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:00:48
honestly i can't tell exactly what they do with money since i don't really know, but as long as i know, they might be able to do that on the pays made by local currency, and maybe save the payments on BTC, or maybe some employee that actually administrates the BTC, i can't give you a accurate answer, but for example, one buisness doing that is "Traki" wich sells clothing, and food... and they are a big chain, probably with powerfull people behind it... and i don't think they need to sell their BTC revenues at least as a priority
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:56:30
No i haven't, and i asked in a venezuelan cryptotrading group in telegram and nobody answered me, so i think is not a thing yet

that's around 110 USD, worth enough to survive one entire month in here... but if someone send me that amount specifically to help people, that's enough to make more than 50 meals to help homeless people in streets!

about the things here if they are getting better or less worse, no, it doesn't, it just keeps getting worse each day by day, but for those who find a way to save money  is getting a lil less worse, everything with btc is creat is really helpfull, the big problems is getting it! why? because the minimum 5\~ USD per month, and for most of normal people, the average citizen, is pretty hard getting enough to actually save anything, but i think if maduro gets kick out, and economy starts fixing slowly, venezuela will be the country in south america in first adopt and normalize the use of BTC
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:41:49
who, me?
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:20:28
i din't know about that fundraising webpage! i'll investigate a lil more futher about it
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:24:42
I don't think is a good idea to purchase directly with BTC because i think it would be a lil bit more expensive than the normal price with local currency, and with this hiperinflation, every dollar, even every cent counts, so is better to exchange the bitcoins to the local currency and buy what i need
0.002 BTC is worth enough for eating well for one entire week, and the cost for a rice is something around 0.0001 BTC, and 0.0002 BTC for a cooking oil... so yeah, bitcoins worth a lot here  
And yeah, is better to exchange BTC to  bolivares at [localbitcoins.com]( to last every single cent
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:47:32
about holding the bear market from 20k, yeah i have heard stories about people holding without using stop losses, sad stories haha, but i don't personally know anyone... what i have know is people who bough near 20k, and had to sell it and losed a lot...
and about if people would leave if they had the funds, well, there is some people in here who doesn't leave because doesn't actually want, but for me, for example, if i had the funds, sure i would leave as soon as i can, and mostly of young people... but almost all the young people have already left the country
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:46:00
with localbitcoins.com 
also localethereum.com, i say the differente is that localethereum works for more little amounts than localbitcoins...
is pretty easy, there is a lot of accepted banks, including mine, wich is Banesco

@_date: 2019-07-07 17:28:02
ugh... i would say that's your opinion, but in fact, i don't come to reddit as a way to get easy money, maybe is pretty easy to say stuff like that living in your confort where you don't have a dictator rationazing you food
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:41:00
all those questions are answered in fact by im just 23 years old now, and when i knew everything this was going to happen, i was just an student without any money at all, and i was sad thinking in the future, scared of what i was going to do when the things get worse... and in fact it happened, and it wasn't surprise for me, but still, i wasn't prepared for it, and yeah, maybe if i knew about cryptocurrency or any way to get money before 2011, sure i would not be in the current situation i am right now
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:14:15
Bitcoin fees allways have been a problem here, since every penny counts haha  
the most popular wallets are for example cryptonator, is the one i am using... also [blockchain.info](
and yes, the most popular cryptocurrency is bitcoin, and also ethereum, because ethereum got less fees and is more friendly to trade with at [localethereum.com](  
Also dash, i haven seen dash stands before, is even more famous than BCH in here... i told you, i have seen lots of DASH stands in marketplaces and events with my own eyes

@_date: 2019-07-07 04:23:07
most of people is likely to use is as a risk investment, but it sure worth the risk, as you're thinking... and about a percentage, well, since more than 50% of the entire population have reached a point of poverty, i think maybe around 5% is relying on BTC, i don't know if you think it might be not too much, but i think it is kinda high amount, and for the other 45%, is people that or is not averse to take risks on btc, or just don't haven enough money to spend it on investments on btc at all...
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:23:53
thanks for the correction my friend
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:55:14
ETH is pretty common since also mining is, and DASH, i have seen lots of stands of DASH in events, other altcoins are more popular for trading more than for transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:48:48
With [localbitcoins.com]( is pretty easy to transform cryptocurrency to local cash, and same to buy bitcoins... 
Already average citizen have heard about bitcoin, but as you may think, there is a lot of people that don't know well about it...
also this is the cheapest country in the world to do mining since electricity is cheap, the problem are the blackouts, and that it is "ilegal", excuses for goverment to stole your miners... so most of miners do it in secret, but it still very rentable !
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:29:38
$300 to $500 per month is enough salary to consider upper to middle class, only earning around 100 USD and barely surviving is consider middle class
With between 300 and 500 USD sure you're able to have a house, car, and money to travel, and going to restaurants... having a good life, like you need around 100 USD per month in venezuela to eat well, the rest could be for luxury, and luxury have become something only for wealthy people in here
and mounthly wage is more around 5 USD per month, we are not in debt, because there is no way to borrow money... most of people only manage to eat twice or once a day, is horrible man, we are surivving in here
And if i reach 0.2 btc sure i would leave venezuela omg, that's enough to go wherever i want, i have a friend in ireland who can recive me if i had that money... if i had 0.2 btc, i would leave right away in just days, i would not wait any longer or think about it twice.
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:29:55
btw what attempt from US in 2002 do you mean? 11 of april of 2002? that wasn't US, it was chavez itself who did an auto coup to himself, to know who were against him, to kick them out, that's were all the shit started.
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:09:24
excuse me but how this is scam? how easy is to type something like that from the confort of your place where you aren't starving and eating well? stop going over internet calling other scamers if you don't know how painfull could be living here, if you were living under the current situation i am living right know because of the dictatorship i have in my country, sure you would understan why do i choose to post here...

1. no, goverment blames USA, but people and normal citizens doesn't... i think is extreamly stupid when people mention the sanctions are the  fault, because as long as i remember, before those sactions, things were already hell hard, and there were diying people already
2. if an american moved here, it may be hostile but not because you're american, even for me going to streets sometimes i feel a hostile atmosphere lol, maybe if you move in car and you get to know people here, you could move safely wherever your want
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:57:27
No, there is not such thing, if you want to donate BTC, you should do it directly to the person who need it... and if you're willing to help me, PM me, i'll gladly give you more information...
Not only there is not legit charity where you can  donate BTC, i don't think there is a legit charity at all in any form, at least not yet.
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:02:55
i don't know if my answer was confusing, but the one that recives bitcoins and transfer your an amount of local currency is actually an user from localbitcoins, not the bank itself

well of course downloable wallets are used too, but some of them (i think) are too heavy to download, and the internet conection here is pretty slow in here, the average download speed in here is 100kBPS
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:41:48
ETH has lower fees than BTC, and is easy to exchange to the local currency at [localethereum.com]( indeed it is a solution agaisn't the high fees of BTC
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:47:13
Sometimes yeah, it depends of what you're looking for, there is also more stores and marketplaces each day who accept BTC as payment method... also cryptocurrency trading courses and people living of that have become pretty commoun, since you can live here with 100-120 usd per month, a lot of people is reliying on that
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:59:51


ignorance, mostly ignorance, because there is also a big group of people who have find hope and salvation from BTC, trading or mining, or just saving on it...  most of people that still reluctant is because the same reasons that in other countries, just because they think is ilegal stuff, or scam, or anything like that, but i say is a miniority, most of wealthy people found out salvation on Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:37:45
in the city i live, for example, the "Guataparo country club" is the ritchest and safest place in here, all the people there owns more than 3 cars, and all the houses have pools... suburbias that looks like US, and people too rich living there... i've been there a few times, and its amazing, but also expensive to live... the security is extreamly high too!
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:13:44
not at all, since there is no one interested at all on investing in such advertisements, but there is each day more places who advertise accepting bitcoin as payment method, sure it counts!
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:32:35


yes, $1 is around 7500 Bolivares, and the cost for one kilogram of rice is between 6000 to 9000 bs, so yeah! 
Indeed, prices are here the same as in other countries... not because the situation is bad and inflation is bad, is  gonna be cheaper... that's why people in venezuela are very likely to be starving.
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:26:31

@_date: 2019-07-07 00:01:12
in localbitcoins you can exchange an amount of BTC for Bolivares(local currency) to the price of the day, and avoid inflation... and same to convert Bolivares to BTC, and you have to use a bank account localy, such as Banesco(mine), Mercantil, Banco de Venezuela, Bancaribe.... keep in mind that it is just a normal money transfer, the local bank is not the one reciving the Bitcoins, but it is the user from localbitcoins
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:38:03

@_date: 2019-07-07 02:36:10
those prices i gave you are about in a city, and if we talk about a pretty expensive place, around 30.000 to 50.000 dollars, and im talking you about great houses... yyeah, prices of houses have extreamly gone down since most of people is emigrating and population is decreasing each day by day
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:34:02
the problem is that i don't own a smartphone ); i took the picture for the proof with my pentium laptop
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:34:53
They can't, just any other goverment can't, that's why its the money of the future, they would do it if they can because as long as i know, venezuela is the country  with BTC volume transactions in all south america, wich means that just having a small fee from it would makes them rich, but it scapes from their hands
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:53:38
HOLY SHITwell, you can buy a car, you can buy ummm man! anything, also the price of houses have dropped a lot because of the lack of demand
1 btc? you can leave the country with 0.1 btc i say! and save the restThat's just enough to be a target for being kidnaped, is just like 50 years of salary, something like that.. because minimum wage is mountly 5 USD, 5 x 12 is  60 ... No, 50 years of salary are actually less than 0.3 btc, is like 150 years of minimum wage! 60 x 150 = 9000! still not enough for one single Bitcoin... you ask me this, and honestly, is hard to figure out the huge amount it is, i mean, you can be rich with less than that! im just freaking out thinking about it...
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:48:59
depends, for those houses, enough... but if they caugh you dealing with drugs or doing some ilegal buisness, goverment could easily expropiate your house and use it for them instead... but for a normal citizen, such thing would not happen
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:20:17
no, i don't own any silver at all.
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:14:38
Depends, to move BTC from one wallet to another it could be expensive, like retirements from binance is around 5$, and i could eat well one week with that...
but once on localbitcoins the fee to sell is smaller and is not a problem
also i see as alternave ethereum because has less fees
