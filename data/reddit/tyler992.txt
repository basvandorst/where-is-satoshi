I think they should not "require" them, but give the people the option to go through KYC, in exchange of a label such as "verified" or something. Just something that would give people a bit of idea of who or what kind of person they are dealing with.

You could have bought a lambo for $200 if you invested 10 years ago. hahaha
But it's not yet late, you can still get into crypto investment today.

would localbitcoins pay for whatever losses that may arise from price changes during the time the account were suspended and the bitcoins are on hold?

how about paxful.com?

Maybe GS are rather skeptical than afraid. As per the bank, reports say that the main reason for their pullback is due to the "regulatory uncertainty". Maybe they just prefer to know what rules and regulations should they follow before engaging, rather than adjusting to new rules from now and then.

We can first educate everyone, the government and the public, on how cryptocurrency works, and why it works. This way, they can create "regulations" or standards for fintechs and crypto companies which would not violate the decentralized and unregulated nature of cryptocurrency (on what that regulation can be, I am not sure yet).
For example, conversion of fiat to cryptocurrency (or other digital wallet) should only be facilitated only by banks or other regulated financial institutions, for them to do their own KYC. (just an example, not really sure if it would work). That way, it would be the bank's responsibility to deter money laundering.

The public's knowledge of what bitcoin is.
Government's hesitance on adapting with bitcoin, and the "volatility" of its value. Plus the number of news of people being scammed on bitcoin exchanges like localbitcoins. There are people, with lack of knowledge on bitcoin and what are bitcoin exchanges, they fear that they can easily get scammed and lose their wealth.

Maybe the plan is to start in East Africa and establish a foothold there before expanding slowly but surely to other parts of Africa?

paxful wallet are safe and reliable. Although as a general rule, do not send significant amount of bitcoins to any trading platform unless you're really trying to sell them all at once.
Also, beware of Too Good To Be True offers in any trading platforms, as they are most likely to be offered by scammers.

Trading with users without that much of a feedback just make things difficult for new-comers. Not to mention that scammers are buying legitimate accounts from sellers who wishes to exit the platform and doesn't care who the hell is buying their account. You just can't put you guard down with these platforms.

i think coinlockers are those sellers who do not release coins from escrow immediately upon confirmation of trades. It's not unique to paxful, and can also be seen with other platforms. The difference tho is that Paxful moderators can and will interfere with your trade to help resolve the situation as soon as possible.

Buy bitcoins from other bitcoin traders. You can use escrow services or trade on platforms that offer escrow services such as paxful.

paypal is a risky payment method in buying and selling bitcoins. So, most exchanges or trading platforms avoid paypal.
Why do you not want to trade in paxful?
@_date: 2018-10-09 11:15:53
localbitcoins is similar to paxful in terms of what you can do. Although paxful has more payment method and better customer service. Localbitcoins is experiencing lots of problems right now, especially with their customer service.

some people say that price stability is required before mass adoption happen, while some people believe that mass adoption will stabilize the bitcoin price. So with that, I'm skeptical that either one of those two will happen in the near future.

trying out different platforms seems to be the only option when there is nobody trading on it anymore.
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:27:37
p2p platforms are already implementing unreasonable KYC, and it limits the choices we have.
