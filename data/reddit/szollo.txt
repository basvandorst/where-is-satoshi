No they're not. The user is paying, as always. And the community is also paying, by having Coinbase &amp; co constantly attacking Core for not raising the blocksize, when SegWit is a de-facto blocksize increase, when fully utilised.

I despair when I read uninformed newbie comments like these.
Please understand that what makes Bitcoin so valuable in the first place is its decentralisation and censorship-resistance. Vast majority of other "coins", or "tokens", operate like companies - that's **absolutely not** what Bitcoin or public blockchains are about. If you wanted to rely on a company to store your wealth, then we are doing that already with banks, and that works pretty well for the ones that are able to afford it.
Another important distinction is that platform such as Ethereum or the other various derivative cloned garbage are vastly different projects - they are not competing with Bitcoin, they're platforms, not stores of value, or mediums of exchange.
Please, please, go back and learn the basics.

That was a very long rant, I think you're missing the point though. OP asked "do you think that *bitcoin* can replace fiat". Not "crypto".
I don't personally subscribe to the idea of a multicoin world, for much of the reasons you wrote.
I think Bitcoin has special properties that make it suitable to become the new form of money of the future, others don't even come close. Maybe the exception would be a future platform for dApps such as Ethereum, but even that can be built on Bitcoin via sidechains.

Here's a Lightning Network point of sale system - it's already reality, not utopian at all:

You realise at this time last year 1 BTC was worth less than $3k?
Have some perspective dude. Bitcoin is a long term (years) hold. It's experimental technology. Lower your time preference.

Spend and replace is all good and well, but it's an inferior user experience compared to good ol' debit and credit cards.
Why go through the extra steps of 1) finding a store that accepts bitcoin, 2) having to replace my precious BTC after purchase, when the experience would be much more seamless just spending my deflating fiat money? Gresham's law.
Also, if you're a US citizen, it's a tax accounting nightmare.
This is one of the many reasons why I think BCash proponents are wrong, and it's a failed project.

This guy Bitcoins.

This. You can see just how butthurt people are even by looking at this subreddit comments or twitter - so much salt it's unreal.
Symptomatic of nowadays culture of instant gratification. People want everything for nothing, and they want it NOW.
If only the lowered their time preference and looked at the bigger picture...

Freedom of choice. Some people don’t need the money right away, so getting paid in BTC right now means that money goes automatically into savings.
I know people that get paid 100% in BTC, funny how I got downvoted for pointing out it’s a thing!
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:23:03
If you go on Twitter, that's precisely how most people refer to when they describe Bitcoin maximalists - hostile and rude.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:42:23
I see what you mean, but for people seeing this with a libertarian lens, the changes that Bitcoin will bring about are liberating. I guess this is also why it has so many detractors - it’s such a potent political statement that its impossible for it not to polarise opinions.

Lots of salty newcomers in this comment section, and this subreddit in general lately.
The points many of you are missing are the following:
1) Never put more than you're willing to lose
2) 1 BTC = 1 BTC
3) Stop getting distracted by daily price action, think of the possibilities, study, help, and look far in the future (years, decades)
This is why most people will never be wealthy. Most people that invested into Bitcoin last year were in it just to buy a lambo. Guess what? Nothing comes for free. HODLers from years past had it much harder, and they were rewarded handsomely for a reason.
Think about the three points above and what they mean, and most importantly inform yourself as to what this really is. It's not going anywhere, and it's unstoppable, unlike many of you seem to think. 
This is why 1 BTC = 1 BTC - you're investing in a future idea, one that is technically getting closer and closer to being achieved.

NOT a lie. You're just not aware of this. Plenty of dev jobs pay in BTC (especially within the blockchain space), you just need to find one.

If you actually heard the interview, they're making more money on the sell-offs, so he doesn't really care if it goes up.

Some people (myself included) choose to look at it from a holistic point of view. It's not just a "platform", it's a multi-faceted revolution at the intersection of money, technology and politics, so it's completely logical for people to identify with it.
This is probably why you find some content "cringe-worthy" - if you zoom out and think about what Bitcoin is, the infinite possibilities ahead and its future place in society should those possibilities come to fruition, you'll quickly see why it _is_ a movement. There was never a time in recent history when separation of money and state was a very realistic scenario.

Good point, though I'd be shocked to find out newbies were using the Satoshi client as a wallet. I'd argue most of that userbase is Bitcoin power users running a node, most of whom would already be aware on how to generate a SegWit address via CLI. Also considering it's an open source project rather than a provider, I'd give them a pass for now ;)

This. What traditionally crashed big rallies was the lethal combo of MtGox and China. 
We are luckily not getting Goxed anymore, and a lot of China's money is out of crypto, so unless something catastrophic happens we can expect healthy dips, rather than major corrections.

To be fair, the internet wasn't ready for the public in 1992 either - similar parallel to Bitcoin now I guess!

Aaah, it was a simpler time... That brings back memories, thanks :)

Agreed. I received the email from the same SMTP address and tweeted both sendgrid and coinbase earlier - on the plus side, this doesn't appear to be a compromise of Coinbase servers ;)

You're wrong. Most merchants use payment processor providers such as BitPay, so they don't care about volatility.
