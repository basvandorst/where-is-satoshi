Looking at the chart for bitcoin, I’m seeing that bitcoin has fallen at maximum between 70-90%. Based on that I’m not going to buy bitcoin again until it’s around $2,000. Then and only then will it start the upward trend. I don’t know how long it will take but I do think we’re headed to 2k.

It literally went under 6k yesterday

Lmao even if you did like how tf would you even do that? If you bought and sold a bunch of times at different prices it would seem super fucking hard to find out your cost basis and profit

Do you guys actually pay taxes on your cashed out bitcoin gains?

That’s the one that got me to buy lol. I had heard of bitcoin before but never actually thought about getting my feet wet in the space. But what do you think about the ATH crashes then recovery to new ATH? Just a coincidence or a trend one should pay attention to?

It doesn’t. That’s why I asked what you guys think. I don’t think it can go lower than 5k before going on another bull run

The white paper reads like the new age bible lmao

If it goes to 5k it will have fallen around 74% from its ATH. I think that if we go by past trends (which are not indicative of future results) we can feel comfortable with investing around that price.

Ok so full disclosure I bought bitcoin in 2017 right when the it’s over 9000 memes hit the front page. I bought in at $9,100. I sold right before it crashed at around $15,200. I’m not gonna lie to you, I forgot about bitcoin after I sold and saw the trend turning super bearish. I didn’t think about getting back in until I saw a bitcoin meme on /all yesterday. I’ve been doing basic research just looking at the price history charts for bitcoin. I noticed that at many times throughout its history, bitcoin has fallen around 69-71% at most between ATH and the lowest point following the recovery from said ATH. You can look up the charts and see the same thing. I’m not saying you should be excited but every time it hit -70ish percent after a crash it *always* went back up to a new ATH. We went from around $19,343 to a low of around $5,800 recently. I’m not saying you should be bullish but in my opinion (which shouldn’t mean shit) bitcoin is already going to go on the up and up. Based on the fact that throughout its history whenever it went to a low of -71% it went back up. Just throwing that out there. Want to know what you guys think.

Those with more than 1 bitcoin, whats your eventual goal? Do you plan on selling it for fiat if it reaches a certain level? What are your thoughts about eventually using it as a currency once the price stabilizes. Do you view it as an alternative to gold?
