Let met tell you that the predictions are always good. When it comes to predict either bitcoin price (which is  $6590.94 now) or stock market price, let us not forget that the macro fundamentals always come into play. Now that the North Korea tension is over, and if all macro economic factors like, geopolitical factors, central banks' responses towards crypto market  and block chain technology will definitely affect the Bitcoin prices positively, we can expect the same as Tom Lee has presented the figure. Let me tell you that the economic factors  may affect all those crypto currencies (almost 1615 and above) that are traded world-wide exchanges.  So Lee's predictions  must be welcome and we have to wait and see how the correction if made on a short-term basis. Needless to say that the long-term views are completely based on the macro fundamentals globally.

Again, let me tell you that the long term story of the Bitcoin mining is completely based on the economic fundamentals that will correct and streamline the basics of prices.. If I reminisce you the 7th July 2017 the Bitcoin mining was traded at $2592.22 (as per the most valid source of bitcoin) compared to today's price which stands at $6576.16. The incremental mining price by 2.53 times (approx).  So it is highly recommended to see how the macro factors correct and streamline the bitcoin mining.
