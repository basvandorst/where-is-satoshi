Thanks for a detailed answer. Okay i'll look into it now thanks.
EDIT: Is the Satoshi client the standard/original bitcoin.org client?

It always happens get over it. Stop investing in such shaky schemes.

Is there a way to do this online? I want a Barleys Ping-It account but I don't have a smart-phone. (I have a Nokia 3310 :()
@_date: 2012-09-26 22:59:32
Hmm, sounds sketchy. Would Tor + instawallet not be more secure?
@_date: 2012-09-27 22:30:41
20% house? No thanks.

How do you know this pool isn't owned by a secret government waiting until the pool contains 51% then strike???!!!

'BitInstant now accommodates online bank transfer from the UK'
Is that classed an an international bank transfer still? Or is it UK to UK? Or SEPA?
@_date: 2012-09-26 22:52:00
Okay thanks I guess :)

For example, if I go on instawallet.com it gives me a 'temporary' bitaddress. Will they be tracking IPs which use this wallet/address?
@_date: 2012-09-26 23:58:04
Right, getting slightly beyond me now. But the arguements sake, it's okay for small transactions? that shouldn't bother whoever would go to an effort right? Also instawallet+public wifi.. i'm pretty damn safe then right? :P

Are you kidding me? People actually believed some guy would give them 7% on their money... a week?
Guys please lets be serious. If it seems to good to be true, it is. And it was.

They don't have batteries in apparently, you just insert coins now to use it. It's a portable payphone.
@_date: 2013-01-27 19:52:02
I'm surprised it got this far tbh, but unreliable, as it could potentially go on forever! -Or not at all.

Can we invest in you?

In an average pool, how much would 330MH/s net you in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-01-12 01:47:20
He probably doesn't, but by speeding up adoption rate, his other bitcoins will make the profit back :)
@_date: 2013-01-08 01:42:58
thanks, some nice info there :)

By announcing that you could care less, it shows that you are not caring the minimum amount, 0 (no care for it).
You should be saying *"I couldn't care less"* which means you are caring the minimum possible amount, zero, for what the rig comes in.

Only 143? wow, maths.

Just putting my personal experience with plus500 in here, i've traded with them, it's a perfect 'beginner to stocks' platform, the stock prices can be a little % high/low sometimes, which I assume is just their cut, but generally i'm very happy with their service. I assume the only negative reviews are due to their rule of no quick buy/sells (forgotten technical word for it sorry) where you buy something then sell it a minute later to benefit from platform price delays/glitches, like sniping on ebay. For which they will shut down your account (and you'll loose all funds) which is fairplay since you accept this in the terms and conditions. Also they only (iirc) have an email support team. But other than that it's a good trading platform for beginners. (They also let you have a demo account which is a great start for wanna-bees)

Fuck, that'd be epic. Truely global.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:30:28
Sounds like a great solution, if you can pull it off.
I'd personally recommend a scaling fee:
-12% for first time transactors, as you pay to confirm their identity.
-10% for the few times after that, fraud is still possible.
-8% for the times after that, when it is certain the credit card is being used legally and chargebacks cannot occur on first transactions i.e. been 90 days.
Just example figures, but yeah. I wouldn't mind knowing if I'm loyal to your service fees go down :)

If PayPal stated it accepts stolen credit cards as a payment, then yes it would be.
@_date: 2013-01-08 01:28:38
Thanks, not heard of that site yet. Unfortunately I think my bank (Natwest) requires a physical authenticator/card-reader to be attached to account to do a SEPA, i'll look into it though. I don't really want to have to wait for it that device to arrive in the post, but I guess i'll have too.
@_date: 2013-02-20 11:27:38
I don't think it's the same. \^Thats stealing, BitCoin is not.
EDIT: Nvm, misunderstanding.
