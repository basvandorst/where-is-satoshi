I thought people might enjoy one perspective from someone on the "outside"... perhaps I was mistaken.  (I also have no problem with the idea that Christians believe all they have is a gift from God and should be used responsibly.)

We have that same brand in East Lansing, and last I checked (which wasn't long ago) the exchange rate they were offering for Bitcoin purchases was over $11,000/BTC, I kid you not.  Why someone would ever use one of these instead of an exchange...

I don't know if that is just the world's most awkward way of saying "you'll be able to buy Starbucks gift cards" or what.

Seriously though, what is the point of asking the question?  It doesn't affect any calculation.  If you had any gains you're supposed to report them anyway. Feel like the whole point of the question is to give their computers an easy way to raise your audit risk level.

It's possible I'm missing something here, but as it is, Gab's move doesn't make much sense to me.  If you want Brave without the BAT features, you can just turn off Brave Rewards - voila, it's done.  As to "replacing BAT with Bitcoin"... so Gab envisions a micropayment system for publishers using Bitcoin instead of BAT?  I'm not sure that's really what they mean, and I'm also not sure that would be as practical - in an earlier incarnation, Brave did use Bitcoin, they switched to BAT.

It struck me that over the last week they've decoupled, ETH hitting a brand new high against the USD today while BTC continues a slow decline.
