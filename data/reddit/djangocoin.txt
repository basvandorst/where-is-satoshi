That's ridiculously pessimistic. The vast majority of the world's wealth is tied up in things like real-estate, bonds, and equities. No one will want to own those things when they can have bitcoin.
When you figure that in, 1 trillion per bit coin is pretty easy to achieve. The actual hard part will be trying to find things like islands to buy because they're all already sold to buy bitcoin. /s

You could probably write a program (maybe as a service) and have it running in the background which just creates or modifies and image with the latest scraped price (api?). Then have it as your wallpaper (maybe have the wallpaper auto change images where all of them have the price if it doesn't autorefresh)... am thinking Windows here.

Just trust banks and intermediaries that store all your info on centralized databases that frequently get hacked and stolen. It's the kind of problem that's only going to get worse.  
  
Satoshi if he does have a ton of btc can't sell them all at once without taking huge losses, and even then it won't kill bitcoin.  
  
Bitcoin is still a nascent technology: if you expect it to be some kind of panacea after only several years then you need to get real.
