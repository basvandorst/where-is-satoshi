Hey, I enjoy what you're doing regardless whether it's legit or not. May I ask you why did you pay all the bitcointalk staff members a sum of BTC?
My wallet needs some filling too 1HGYNMGkXPDwhtfHZ63ne9T1DT6cyAfZMg
Also I believe I know where your previous wealth came from, so you owe me some of that :)

Check the ZeroMQ notifications at  As far as I know this is the best you can have right now without heavy modification to an existing client.
Spamming the RPC is really not efficient and you can't really make notifications for anything else than blocks and transactions in and out of your wallet if you really spam it. It's also not reliable to call the RPC as the command queue can get overloaded and you might miss blocks and transactions and all that. It's also not realtime.

Also if the software looks into unconfirmed inputs to see if they had too low fees and compensates for them. I'm currently doing this manually for over 100 transactions that my service sent out using fees that were just a little bit too low. Now I'm compensating for them by paying about $20 in fees.

I booted up my old phone to see the Bitcoin ticker was stuck at around $2 using MtGox exchange rate because I've never booted it up after that. They've discontinued support for that particular ticker so it didn't update anymore when I booted it.

and how do you think the miners benefit from not including transactions to their blocks and instead add "fake transactions" that surely won't bring them any extra fee income?
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:12:05
of course it doesn't
@_date: 2017-01-17 03:29:45
gotta get me some bittocoins

he didn't buy anything but thinks announcing that here would cause more people to buy and make the price go up.

Pretty sure they've already gotten a lot of recognition already...

why is turbo at minimum? no wonder we are still poor

Stupidest accusation I've seen in a while. They couldn't even steal your Bitcoins unless they fished your password by changing the page source code just for your browser as nobody else was effected. Blockchain.info wallets are stored encrypted and then decrypted on client side. I highly doubt that's the case.
You probably just lost them yourself by doing something stupid.

It should be obvious they can't disclose everything what's happening within the company. You don't really need that information either to be honest. It could be a legal problem or a problem with fees or whatever to support people from your location or with your information or whatever. Telling the problem to the public might cause problems to them.
@_date: 2016-09-09 15:02:25
Well, yeah. The transactions could just be built and signed on client side as you said and the server could just broadcast them. I knew it was a risk making that comment being this tired. I now deleted it so I don't look like an idiot. Sue me :)

Your computer or network could be compromised and your security settings wouldn't help against that. I highly doubt the problem is on blockchain's side.
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:11:59
This is from their TOS. I was pretty much spot on

You don't have to be a poor student to experience this. It's all relative. With more money you invest more

 the graph in the bottom. I love this page and I use it to get all the stats I need about the current network status

I knew about bitcoin back then and was  pool miner of litecoin in the world at least on english sites, yet I made close to nothing in the end.
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:39:45
that's how you start to get involved enough to get on the russian hit list
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:34:13
yes, if you're looking to sell 1-3 minutes later, but this is trustable advice for the next few days!
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:13:03
yes it is. Why does an address starting with 11111 take way longer to find than an address that starts with 11119? Same with addresses 11111 and 19111, whichever way you wanna look at it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:58:32
I wish. I used to hold cryptos worth hundreds of thousands of dollars now and I actually never made almost any money out of them. Been using BTC since 2011.
@_date: 2016-07-25 20:06:16
Do you have something against bitstamp? I expected it to be one of the first on the list but how come I don't see it. I'm just asking to know if people have something against bitstamp for some reason that I don't know about.

In the past 2 months customers have paid me with sub 10s/B transactions and sometimes they've been confirmed within hours and one 10s/B was confirmed within 5 minutes. I didn't resend them with higher fee to get them confirmed.

If he's a dev it benefits him so that he has access to the full blockchain data locally so he doesn't have to rely on a 3rd party to make certain operations for him. It benefits the community because now other Bitcoin servers/clients can also download data from his server so effectively it increases the Bitcoin network bandwidth.
