Check the mempool here, and see where your transaction fee fits, and you should approximately understand if it will take too long to confirm your transaction or it should be soon.

So if your government tells you this, you would obey immediately?
Blindly following is forbidden in Islam, too.
And yes, he is talking about Egypt. So, he says it is forbidden in Egypt, but according to clerics in some other countries it is not forbidden, so it’s just their opinion, they cannot force anyone to follow their opinion or fatwa when it is just local cleric.

For me as a muslim, this is BS. Islamic scholars take advices from people working in Islamic finance (banking system). Ofcourse they will advise them against something that hurts centralized institutions. 
Everything in islamic economics is based on the gold and silver, such as paying taxes (Muslims pay yearly tax-zakat 2.5%, only if they are holding more than x amount of grams in gold for more than a year, and price of gold is monthly calculated to national currencies) and everything else.
From my own research and knowledge in Bitcoin and Islam, I’d say that bitcoin is much better as payment system than any other currency used today by muslims. The only thing that could be considered as “risky” is price volatility, but I personally believe that volatility will be reduced by mass adoption.

Also to mention that these clerics are part of the government of president of Egypt, who became president after military coup. There is no way they can think clearly under his ruling.

Totally disagree! If government bans something, it does not mean that clerics should declare it haram. They can say that it is not recommended, but not haram just because government said so. People should use their heads and do own research instead of just blindly following governments and clerics.
EDIT: He said: "This currency is used directly to fund terrorists..."
Well, cash is also used to fund terrorists. Is cash haram also?

When sending from Copay, before sending you have option to set custom s/b fee (below super economy option, or whatever it is called, cant remember anymore). If you can wait for confirmations, then set low fee.

In simple language, they will be available to spend again without problems :D
I’m still learning, too :)

You didnt lose it, if the fee is too low, your funds will come back to you after some time. 
Mempool’s size is reducing so probably it will be confirmed soon. 
If you’re in hurry, you can recover your wallet on some other device and double spend it with higher fee and first transaction should be canceled.

Both support Segwit.

Transaction fees are expressed in Satoshis, if bitcoin price goes up, fees go up, too. But Segwit firstly, and then LN should heavily decrease tx fees.
