You are a fool if you think inside people weren't involved or telling you everything. This was obviously an inside job.  Everyone of these thieves has been caught over time.   There is no way to not be traced.  It might take years but jail time sits neatly on the horizon.   I guarantee you.

Seriously, there are idiots who think they can do it and not get caught.   It's hilarious.  A few times it's taken several years for Feds to catch up, but they do every time.

Binance is no longer in China.  BTCE was gutted for the most part, and if you think that history there is not still being chased you're being silly.  Bitfinex owners have already been chased and if you think there will be no repercussions to laundering money you live in a dream world.   The Piper always come calling.
I don't need to prove anything.   History shows you that the thieves, money launderers, drug dealers have all been caught one by one.   Mtgox, silkroad, sheep,  scores of small time exchange thieves, korean exchange ...
I agree that washing to other coins creates an issue, but most of those are also trackable.   Washing in BTC is a fool's errand at large scale because they have to re-aggregate to sell.   Everytime they re-aggregate (even if converted to other coins) and go to an exchange and then move money to a bank they are KYC'ed and asked where the money came from.      Show me a single major thief that has not been caught yet.   Only a fool thinks they have a clever way of avoiding or that they are not being watched.   Creating a fake business or claiming profits on coin trades requires proving the history to the point that fiat was used to enter.
The main thing here I want to know is was this person allowed to exit BTC from Mtgox post the shutdown.   If so, those coins are Gox assets.
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:52:33
I hope to god he is a FED and we will assist him all day long.  Anyone moving coin across so many exchanges is clearly up to something.     If the coins are related to gox or other thefts it’s simply a matter of time.  These exchanges know who is getting the fiat after trades.  No where to hide.
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:14:13
They ALWAYS get caught.  Every single hilarious thief has been caught.   It’s an open ledger.   Tumblers don’t matter.  They aggregate back to wallets again to sell.   Honestly I love it.  It’s all perfectly traceable, the key being when they attempt to get back into fiat.  You would have to be a fool with a death wish to try to hide that much coin into fiat.   You cannot.  Even if they just trying to avoid taxes or manipulate markets, the feds/banks/exchanges will track it due to the value.

You will continue fighting...to not go to jail.
The data so far has already shown you lied.   You knew of issues well before, and likely created them.  Why was the database missing key records?  Hmmm.  Oh the hacker did it.   Riiiiight.  You scum bag.   The US gov took it?   Oh and they all deleted the key records showing the internal thefts and redirection? Right.  That makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:27:42

Not really.   Once someone cashes out, they can be traced backwards and forwards with vast troves of metadata to further grasp how the coins got there.    It's funny but many thieves think they can hide, mix coins etc.  Truth is its just a matter of time before they will get caught with money they can't explain and the investigation starts.

I hope law enforecement uses every trick in the book to ensnare and shut these pigs down.  Just like we saw with online gambling years ago, there is no where the pigs running exchanges like this or running mixers/tumblers can hide.  entrap them I say, i like it

You must already realize you can't stop this and it will happen more and more.  Either that or bitcoin fails which is unlikely.  Instead you will see the holes for thieves closing and regulations getting heavier and heavier (in this case proving how someone accumulated bitcoins and the source of any entry fiat).

Oh yes.  Poor Mark.   He isn't hiding anything.  All that data to support his claim, all the data around transactions....well he wanted to share it, but he forgot to.   Most people who were stolen from would be claling police and sharing the data, but curiously Mark has been hiding the data and not answering questions.  How odd.  Wonder why he does that.  What will the data show when it gets out there??   There is no hiding Mark.   You didn't erase the data effectively (see willy report around how data was altered but the were still able to figure out what was edited).
@_date: 2014-08-24 22:42:30
You're a fool.  There is no terms of service that says we can take your money and walk away with no fear of being prosecuted.  Was it risky to use Gox, of course, but in no way does that absolve Gox of criminal wrongdoing.   There are laws, even if it was bitcoin.  Time will tell just how long before enough evidence is gathered.  but it's a guarantee it's coming.  Your comments mean nothing.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:06:37
Wrong.  If a stolen address comes in directly, it should be rejected and reported.  Or delayed while authorities are contacted.

We still shouldnt let this go.  If it was Jed, then he moved these coins before MtGox shutdown.  That means lots of inside info was being traded.  Authorities will want to know this as he is an owner of MtGox still.  That would have changed prices for all involved and I suspect even though its bitcoin, its probably illegal.

More turd sewage spewing forth.  I'm not trying anything; I don't need to.  You're missing the point.   Your words have no meaning.  You can't stop it.  Claiming theft and showing no proof, hiding data and himself.  It's just a matter of time before the data is accessible.   All we have to do is wait and see.  I love that.  really, your words (and mine) have no meaning here.   You can't stop the train coming.   If you thought otherwise, well that's amusing.  
This quote states the facts the best "Stop repeating this nonsense, fraud and theft apply to any asset, you don't need special laws for Bitcoin. Unregulated means it doesn't get treated like a currency by the government, it doesn't mean people can steal your shit."  Simple, elegant, obvious and unavoidable.  All that's needed is the data, and that's coming piece by piece. 
For my amusement, I'll add the following facts for you:
1.  He claimed the malleability hack as the source of the theft.  This was an opportune moment.  We know for a fact it was not, and there is plenty of data now to show if he wasn't involved, he knew of the database hack before claiming a malleability hack.  That alone is suspect enough to investigate him.
2.  He has not shared the data nor any facts on a "theft."  Constantly hiding and shady.  More than enough reason for authorities to start an investigation into him personally.  If you think they aren't doing this, keep dreaming.  I guarantee you there are just getting ducks in a row before packing him off.
3.  the leaked database had altered records removing the willy bot transactions.   It also failed to reveal the raw data after december, the data that really matters.  This was an obvious attempt to divert blame.   See the Willy report for facts on how they figured out data was altered to hid the willy bot transactions.
There is more than enough circumstantial evidence to go after him and force more answers of damages/jail if he won't, in the absence of him providing any data to support his claims.  If you think he can claim theft and walk away scott free with no proof, I'm really shocked you'd believe people aren't going after him right now as we speak.   Once they have the rest of the data, it's game over.  Bitcoin is not anonymous.
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:44:09
Again he says nothing.  Nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  useless and obviously hiding information.  All he says is before we could open we need security experts to verify the new system.   He makes no mention of finding the "thieves" or experts to help with that.   Such a damn shady character.  Tell us what happened and give us the data.  The public can sleuth the rest, no need to pay experts.  hell, I'll come for free and help.
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:16:37

Negtaory.  This is incorrect and FUD.  Show me where in the paper it talks about this.  Most folks completely disagree with you except the few libertarians who want anarchy to reign so they don't have to pay taxes.
Bitcoin was always meant as a supplement.  It has amazing features of a worldwide standard, digital, no chargebacks, decentralized, etc.  I still think the majority of cases we want the ability to do chargebacks, so we need the old system anyway (I suppose BTC services could be added on top to do this).  I think it's an integration that BTC was meant for.  So we can leverage those good features when we want them, and use FIAT systems when we want to.

Some of BTC thieves are and drug BTC folks use localbitcoin agents to launder their money and give them a % or any value above some target price it looks like (guessing based on data).  Doing any cash transaction with localbitcoins where you are selling and it adds up to over 10K I would think puts you into a territory you don't want to be (if you don't register yourself properly and report all transactions).  I used localbitcoins once and then stopped.  It is just waaaaaaaay too shady.  Plus I don't want to help the BTC thieves get any cash...force them to exchanges if the want fiat so they can get caught.
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:00:09
The reasons are obvious.  No names, no accountability behind it.  It's in a country where there is nothing you can do to get your money back if they decide to walk away.  At least with Gox it was in a country with some laws that can be leveraged and at least we knew who owned it (who to go after).   The reasons are obvious and arguing anything else is silly.  
Your arguments are silly as as your comments my experience with btc.  It's apparent to all why you struggle to argue here (rationalize your risk).   It's like arguing for creationism.  You ignore raw fact staring you in the face and try to justify to yourself the risk you're taking, while trying to convince others.  No problem with risk, just don't try to convince others BTC-e is somehow safe yet behind all that anonymity and lack of law.

Dude, there is nothing you can say here.  No words that will make it go away.  Poeple know he will be charged.  Doesnt matter if he was selling btc,  donuts or gizzwatts.   Doesnt matter how risky it was to make purchases there.  You can;t just walk away with customer funds and claim it was stolen with no proof.  He has been hiding the data becuase it implicates him and others, that's why there has been a delay.   I suspect you're involved and hoping it will go away. Haha Good luck.  Data is all knowing, and once its out there, he's f%^$cked.   No words here will save those involved.  the data exists, it just wasn't being shared.  You can already see people piecing it together (willy report).  The circumstantial evidence alone so far is damning, damning.  His hiding data and being dodgey the whole time speaks voooolumes.

Buzzer says no Shemmon.   Bitstamp asks for verification of source of funds all the time as part of AML.   Bitstamp needs to show they are a part of the self-regulation process and look into these addresses.   Ask the user to PROVE how they came into the cash that led to them making these bitcoin (prove on the blockchain and source of their own funds).  If they can't or won't prove it,  freeze the funds and alert authorities.   Bitstamp already does this verification step as I have been through it.    So sorry bud, thieves can't get away that easy, just watch.

I have had issues with the 0.9 client crashing on me sometimes during sends.  I'll try this out.  The bittorrent bootstrap download built in is great as well as the speed up in scanning.

Fair enough, I generalized and made assumptions.  As you did. 
No one wants to be tracked.  I won't tolerate those seeking to add more anonymity for the purpose of thievery though.   These folks are the true cancer, not innovation and venture funding.   I agree ithat self (preferable, eg exchange transparency and tracking of criminals) or gov. regulation needs to be added cautiously of course.   But without regulation and transparency, the thieves will continue to steal.   It's just human nature.   The regulation will happen, anyone with any sense can see it coming.  Nothing we speak about here will change that natural process evolution of something so innovative.  Guarantee we will see the thieves who thought they could get away also caught one by one.   We all own bitcoin, though we will see a deep changing of the guard in the coming years.

I can promise they won't do that; guaranteed.   The $135 price was after the issues started.  This would unfairly bias towards the cash holders, of which you are likely one.   I guarantee it will be based on market value of BTC in general at the time of liquidation.  Anyone with any sense can see that.  A $135 price would not only be illegal, they would get sued.

@_date: 2014-03-31 03:32:51
If Gox funds went into it then it will be part of the liquidation.   No one will be getting away with assets that belong to the customers now.   If "Luke" paid for this, then he should have no trouble proving it.
I fGox was providing hosting, then who is paying for that now.   Eligius at a minimum will owe some money back into Gox I suspect.   Who owned the hardware?  If Gox, it will be part of he liquidation no doubt.  That means they also own some part of the mined coins.  Wherever Mark may have been spending customer assets for operations will be large targets for the court.

Negatory, disagree.  The paper speaks nothing about anonymous transactions as being fundamental to bitcoin.  That was scheming druggies, tax cheats and gun sellers who jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon for that part.  I think exchanges will do it as they would rather bitcoin grow.  Self-regulate to prevent more gov.  regulations.   Either way it will happen, there is no where to hide.

@_date: 2014-03-23 17:11:42
Mix coins won't help if exchanges self-regulate.   Bitstamp already requires proof of source of income for bitcoins.   They can just track the largest accounts against a list of known stolen addresses.   So you work from the bottom up in thefts by tracing bitcoin addresses at the same time that exchanges work from the top down of accounts with large holdings.   If the addresses link up,  make the user prove the source of their income with blockchain proof and fiat entry proof.   if they can't prove it, freeze all assets and alert authorities.   Anyone who thinks this won't happen or isn't already has an awakening coming.

Bullshit.  That was likley him cashing out his BTC as BTC withdrawals were locked.   Most of his value likely evacuataed then (insider trading speculated).   He hasn't made any public statements making this highly suspicious.  The books need to be opened and investigated, and if Sunlot gets the books I doubt we will ever see what happened.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:41:04
Uhhhh.  This is what 100% of everyone knows already is needed.  It's natural evolution and there is nothing anyone can or should do about it.   The people that want to destroy bitcoin are the thieves, cheats working to make bitcoin more anonymous.  I like decentralization, but folks touting zerocoin and dark wallets and mixers have obvious reasons for their support of such tech.  One by one we keep seeing these folks rung up on federal charges for drugs, laundering or soon tax evasion as we discover their real reason.  Evolution and tech will weed these folks out so the rest of us can use bitcoin properly.  the folks claiming to be libertarians who are "trying to free the people" always turn out to have much darker motives behind their support (drugs, tax evasion, gun selling, laundering,  etc)  Evolution will weed them out and everyone already knows it.  That is what regulation and process does, weed these fu%$^# thieves out and punish them.  Can you say Mtgox.
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:23:04
Let's see if he tries to hide the transaction data now (erase it) as part of the sale.  His plan was to try ot keep the company so he can control/hide the records.   Now he probably thinks he can erase the relevant data before the asset sale.   Good luck, he is headed to jail no matter what he does now.

Trust?  Who would trust someone offering nothing to take assets for free.  We'll never let this happen lol.  Liquidation will get us more than what these asshats plan (20%, only 50% of fees going to creditors).   Guess who gets whats left after creditors get less than liquidation value,  they can filter off assets for themselves via salaries and stock ownership.   They HAVE TO PAY to get assests...that's how this works.  Otherwise f$% off low-life scum.  
That's what valuation is all about.  Future value of the assets; that's why these guys are here, they want to make money for free off the backs of the current asset owners.    THEY HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY or go home.

They proposed they would pay 1 BTC to take over MtGox.   A limited subset of the assets would be returned to customers.   The customers would get ore simply by liquidating, so there is no reason to vote yes on this.  Their plan includes keeping assets and also only using 50% of fees (not 100%) to pay customers.   Sure some would go to operating and capital to reopen,  but this is the cash they must front, not take from existing customers so they can profit.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:51:29
Curious if this is another attempt to hide the data before it's exposed.  There was an apparent massive withdrawal of BTC on Feb. 6th prior to withdrawals being locked out.   I wonder if these MtGox owners were evacuating coins before declaring bankruptcy later, and this is an attempt to hide all the data.   Did someone explicitly mention that Jeb was part of this deal, that they would buy him out?  Sketchy.

He has been ridiculously sketchy the whole time.  Where is the data?  Simple question.   why did he not get police involved a long time ago.   He has been far too shady and hiding details.   If he really was robbed, he would have openly shared the data and been begging for help.   He obviously has things to hide.
If he claims theft, he must prove it.   He made no visible efforts to do that.  This will land him in jail, wait and see.
Claimed "transaction malleability" at an opportune moment when the issue came up, but he knew then, and we know now that he already knew about the thefts and that transaction malleability had nothing to do with it (proven).  It was an outright and obvious attempt to get away.  It's clear he thought he could claim theft like others had and walk away easily.  Such a fool.   Whatever he has been hiding will come out.
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:02:13
There is enough data now to know for a fact that Mark has been lying and hiding coins.  It appears he was intending to steal these coins all along, and when the transaction malleability ooportunity came along, he used it as an excuse.  None of his proposed timelines of theft discovery or suddenly finding 100 million in coins lines up with other known data.  So its a FACT he has been lying.  There is way too much data now to show his timelines at a minimum are outright lies (he picks dates and actions he thinks will protect him from legal action).   The number one thing is getting the database records and proving he is lying.  If he tries to delete the databases or modify them he will go to jail (likley this is what he has been trying to do but the blockchain will show any manipulation)  .   he is $%# no matter what he does now, its guaranteed he goes to jail and there is no path where he can hide coins.

Rockin'!!!!  I love it, those bastards didn't get anything.  Love it when thieves get nothing and especially when they get caught.
Maybe try encrypting the (armory) wallet with an 18 char password inside another zip as well with a different 18 char password.   Then store that in a gmail with 2fa.  Put the email password in the safe deposit box with the zip +wallet password.    then your relatives could get access if you die.  If you are alive, you would get an email if someone tried to access that account.      Just thinking out loud.
You also need to print out the 10 extra 2FA codes and put that in the safe deposit box.
if you wanted to be crazy safe, print out the codes, passwords, etc in an encrypted printout, and keep the password for the encrypted paper in your home safe, while putting the encrypted paper in the bank deposit box.

I'm all for innovation, but these are clear attempts to pull the wool over people's eye's so a few can profit.  They're trying to use bitcoin popularity to get a foothold.   There no innovation here, just adding complexity to bitcoin that simply isn't needed, and it could lead to its demise.  Why dont they go create their own coin optimized for what they want....why? becuase they are trying to leverage bitcoins popularity to hijack it.

It's easy all.  You just take a screen capture when first setting up the 2FA, for each site (capture the QR code it gives you to scan).   Save that as a jpg and store them in a zip with aes256 encryption with a really long password (like 15-20 chars).   Back it up.   If you ever lose your phone, go to the zip file and scan the jpg QR codes to get all your stuff working again.   Most 2FA this works great for.

I've been saying this for weeks like many others.    Bitstamp should step up and help self-regulate, or its business and bitcoin in general won't grow if we have people like some commenters here supporting thieves and anonymity.   Bitstamp requires people already to verify the source of the funds that get them into bitcoin, I had to do it (actually prove the source of my cash).   Here there is a simple (required) process of asking the account holder here to prove the source of their cash.  If they can't prove it (against the blockchain as evidence as well), freeze their funds and alert authorities...in this case this is likely Mark himself selling so alert Japan authorities and bankruptcy supervisor.

BTCe might as well be in China, where they promote fraud and no one gets prosecuted (unless they dont pay the gov official).   You would have to be crazy to be using it.   No accountability whatsoever, no names, and past stolen coins seems to flow there, so they promote theft clearly.    If they cooperated with authorities and released their server logs so IP's and accounts could be traced I'd trust them a little more.   But its' quite obvious, this is a criminal type site.

I think the case against mark K. is likely to very strong.   Records were deleted.   I was saying back in feb last year.   It was way too obvious that the DB he handed over had all the recent transactions scrubbed and only had totals  (who wants to wager that that person who released the DB was him to throw off the scent).  Who else could do that.   I'll wager they will show only he had reasonable access and the access logs at some point (all they need is 1 example) will show he was the one he entered and acted as willy and the other bot.   He's been so incredibly dodgy and not helpful.    They will show he used the transaction malleability as a last ditch excuse when he had no such evidence.  It's all way more than circumstantial.  And japan is particularly hard on people hiding assets and lying, especially with such huge sums.    I feel it's certain he will be in jail at the least, and they will likely wring out of him where coins are that might be left.

When goes to cash out, he will have unexplained cash that gets reported.   That leads to a backward trace.   He will not escape.  Gaurantee.  It might take a little time, but everyone will be watching and tracing.   Once he goes to cash in any unexplained cash (doesnt matter if does a little bit at a time, by end of year they will aggregate it up and see the large sums).    He could try localbitcoins, but all that takes is one squeeler in the network of sellers.  he will be caught.    It's guaranteed and there is always a trace.   thieves always are made to pay, ideally with their lives but jail and family impact suffices.   Mark K. is next and we all know it.

All the points you make about Michael are true for you as well.   You're trying to convince people bitcoin is about anonymity, fungability.   It's not.   It's about a worldwide standard for currency, that also lets you be your own bank when you want it.   Look, ultimately Michael was right about the need for increased blocks to increase throughput.   That's just natural evolution.   You can argue against, but it's evolution and what the masses want.   You can't stop that train.   Michael was just trying too hard in a short timeframe (probably because of some cash payout for making it happen.   He's not a leader of anyone of real import as you noted, so there was no way he could move that mountain that fast).    Bitcoin isn't meant to topple governments or create chaos or take power from them, or for people to hide money from taxes etc.   It's a another very useful in tool in the currency toolbox that allows us to be our own bank or move currency around the world with no middleman taking a piece if we don't want what they offer.     It's simple evolution and you can't stop it.   The majority is not focused on anonymity and hiding the drug money or tax money.   We want the international standard and the large scale capable system.  It's coming no matter what, and the banks will be forced to integrate with it.   They can't solve the international standard part with their own, so they will eventually have no choice as it grows.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:16:27
and anyone who thinks "big data" cant trace this over time is kidding themselves.   Don't forget about network connection tracing and the exchanges own records.   What really makes it easy is once they are targeted due to having unexplained cash, that backward trace lines up with the forward trace making it so easy.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:31:30
Welll fwak me.  That means that the US gov likely really did confiscate and start selling MtGox stolen bitcoin.   That's the only way to explain those large sums of coin from silkroad.   Those sums were just too high to have just been drug trades at small scale.  People were saying this on reddit and we ignore them months ago.
Mark K is surely dead now, soon to be.   
So it's likely theyknew this and then sold these bitcoin anyway.   If these coins get traced to the seizure I for one will be suing the agency responsible for selling my stolen coins  (&gt;400 gox coins).   They had no right to cash those in.

That is a false misleading tripe someone posted.  The mission of Bitcoin I have declared already to be ease of financial transactions across borders digitally.  It has nothing to do with hiding money, drugs, evading taxes, guns.   It's not about suggesting anarchy or anything else.  There are limited times when we need decentralized currency, but we need centralized currency more often.  Bitcoin is great when we want decentralized currency to keep at home, or transact easily digitally across borders.   But those are limited use cases.    Great we have this tool when we need it though.
This train is already in motion and wins more every day.  You can't fight evolution.  Anarchy is not evolution, its devolution, which is why the majority=normal people always crush it brutally.

AOC is a young fool, but we are and always will be way ahead.   Diversity drives evolution, and the US remains extremely diverse and innovative. There is no chinese innovation of note, nor will there except via theft until they collapse and China is remade.  Only theft at magnitudes most people don't understand.   It is outright evil mentality to grow through stealing.   But their whole economy is a farce.   As the US cuts off channels for the flow of US dollars, their paper money (RMB) random printing for a fake economy is being exposed.  This is why they are pressing so hard on Hong Kong so they can control the narrative and the US dollar flow that is left.   They have to control the Hong Kong Banks and inflow/ourtflow of US dollar.  They are dead in water without that flow, as it exposes the weakness in their fake economy.   Trump has cut of the flow of US dollars through a number of channels, tariffs forcing less buying being one.   Why do you think they kicked Jack Ma out and took over his company (hilarious!!!, can you imagine a gov taking over a large tech company and inserting it's own leaders and raping the equity and cash flow).    When the fake economy really starts to collapse, guess who will be holding the bag....they will rape the chinese citizen and their investments in real estate.   Those miles and miles and miles of empty paper mache condo's..... that's what will be wiped out financially...that means it's all the regular folks who invested in that unusable real estate they plan to rape to rebalance the books and take the hit (probably will take over formally other large companies, they control Huwei but not like they did to jack Ma's company, but I expect they will).

Who said centralization?   Decentralization is part of what makes it so valuable for everyone.  being able to hold your old money without worry someone will claim they went bankrupt with your cash.     The international trade/standard also a major reason its so valuable.
The fungibility is a nice to have but not the main goal.  Those that think it will lose no matter what.   The market forces to add microtransactions and larger block sizes is a guaranteed future; you can't stop it because that is where the dev money is.
The folks resisting larger block sizes are often those who have a reason to hide money and transactions.   the majority of us need bitcoin for some of the features I listed.  I want to go to France without having to carry cashier checks with me or pay exorbitant exchange fees.

Idiot.  If you cant accept the consequences that theft will always be punished you are on the wrong end of the argument.   You know who will win here and its not libertarians.  These scumbags always end up caught in the end.  Everything gets accounted for.  Bitcoin wasn't meant to hide money.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:04:07
Scum bag low life exchanges only acting when its drug money eh.  What about Mtgox or the other thefts.  Everyone knows they were filtered through BTC-e.   If they think their day isn't coming, they're in for a suprise.   everywhere we can place a name to an owner an accounting will be coming.

I will buddy if I'm not paying 3% and there is no middle man account like paypal has.  Done.
@_date: 2015-03-09 01:22:06
Cut to two years later....another shrem and megaupload and tor and snowden and ulbright.  Each caught or infiltrated or actually infiltrated all along.
what was even more hilarious was they thought they wouldnt get caught.  It was always just a matter of time and focus.  Then their lives were over except for the horrid reality of federal prison and everything taken from them and their FAMILY.  hahahaha.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:00:32
Hysterical that BTE-e only did when it was drug money.   Why didnt we see exchanges do this when it was MtGox or the others.   Scum bag low lifes.

The data and  MK's actions speak for themselves.  He obviously did it and it's going to come to light, just like all these other thieves and cheats who thought they were untouchable getting caught one by one.   They can't escape the need to convert to fiat and get caught.  Any fool who thinks otherwise just needs to look at the data.   Every cheat or tax evader is getting caught....silk road, sheep thief, charlie, gov officials stealing, US ponzi schemers, localbitcoin sellers, that hongkong ponzi schemer, the list goes on
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:38:10
I think it's beautiful.  Go Chainanalysis.   cheats and thieves have no where to hide.  they thought they did.
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:49:30
Wrong.   It's the least most important.  Blocksize is far more important.   The natural forces here, regardless of what you or I believe, will force this.    Most people don't care about fungibility and hiding transactions for guns, kiddie porn, drugs etc.  But they do want the international standard digital currency.  The full weight of silicon valley is behind it, and it's a behemoth.   It's like natural evolution you can't stop.   The fringe side of bitcoin is continually being weeded out.  What's left is something valuable for everyone, just without druggies and scum thieves, etc.
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:38:35
No this is a great service.  I think it's beautiful. Go Chainanalysis. cheats and thieves have no where to hide. they thought they did.

This is likely a failed ploy at protecting stolen assets
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:27:41
Who cares, they are gone?  LOL if this guy isn't suspicious I don't who is.
I can promise you the extra cash and bitcoin will go the the creditors.    You obviously hope it won't.  maybe some stake there perhaps.   let's see how this actually plays out.
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:09:31
Also wrong.  There are lots of ways we na eventually track this, and it will happen.

Silk Road, Tor network, localbitcoin sellers, fraud bitcoin scams....its taking a few years but these folks always end up caught when its large sums of money.   We'll see.
Everyone swore that Silk road was impenetrable, same as Tor.  Let's wait and see who is right.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:15:27
lol, yeah use dynamic languages for that for sure
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:09:14
LOL such bullshit meant to trick people pursuing this.  The data shows it was funds that weren't real.  So 100% it was not real investors but an inside fraudster who has his time coming.   There is no escape for the thief or his family.   No ploy with words on the internet.  Facts are facts and inescapable.   Judgement is coming, 100% guarantee.

This is where you are misleading people.   20% of Mtgox is not 20% of the market at that time.

Nailed it.  Ignore people like ObviousWallAtenna intentionally spreading FUD.   Malleability was a minor concern and used more as an excuse that "pushing" them over the edge.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:11:35
Just use a new wallet.  Slime here will likely look to use the fact they know your addresses belong to the same wallet. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:14:02
This is the only viable answer I have heard so far, staying in the BTC.   But even that probably won't work as yu buy things, chain analysis knows who you are buying from.   These coins are watched.   That company will be asked for records and shipping addresses etc.  You can try a fake address but when you go to get your package they are watching. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:07:56
I think they key point remains also the top down approach.   As soon as you start to convert to fiat, it's getting aggregated under someone's name and account at banks.   In  frames of 1 yr or more.    You could try to make a fake business, but that tends to crumble when KYC comes knocking and asking you to explain expanding cash origins.     Crypto currency will remain a side currency for certain valid purposes.   Thieves will always need to get fiat.  And at this large a sum, I'm quite confident they will be caught.     Move money around all day in crypto but eventually forced to return to the system raise attention with KYC regulations to force adherence.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:02:51
My point was a little less complicated, but complicated still.   I'm not talking about accessing all the private troves which you used to make things even harder in your argument.    Even with just the blockchain data and Mtgox data we have, companies like the one mentioned here traced the transactions.      Its the top down work (banks aggregating cash amounts and asking prove origins) that drives some of the connections as well.     Remember banks are always looking at sudden growth of new cash (even in blocks of up to 1yr) and use KYC to force you to prove origins.   
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:34:14
Still, banks know new cash coming in over periods of time unless you go very small and very slow and no criminal will do that.   Over the period of 1yr that amount will addup to something they will flag under KYC and you have to explain the origin.
Sure selling to another entity in a country that doesn't care you could try.   But that also means the other gangsters in that country (gov.)  will be aware and want a cut or want to take it wholesale after slaughtering  them and their family.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:05:56
Here's why you get caught.    Again it's the banks.    They look at blocks of time and new cash.   Sure set up fake anonymous business, but any growth in cash that exceeds your past rates get flagged.   They ask questions.    You have to prove the origins of the cash.   As soon as they investigate your proof, it would crumble rather fast.  The world of pure digital currency is a long time away.   they have to convert to fiat for a long while to have any value.    they will get caught.   It's hard work no question, but new money always get questioned, especially at this magnitude we're talking here.   I hope they try this.  Key to my point is unless you know millions of people to spreed money to, you are forced to aggregate cash to yourself and you get caught that way.  
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:08:53
It's all trackable these days.   I don't care how many micro transactions you make.   Brute force machine learning at the bottom end coupled with the banks when they try to exchange money and can't explain origin.   It's beautiful and they always get caught, especially when they think they're smart.    The blockchain is a glorious ledger.   They always end up aggregating to get back into cash.    Banks just need to looks at large blocks of time like 6months (which they do).   If unexplained money is flowing, work top down by making them KYC explain how they got it, while at the same time people are going bottom up from the blockchain.   Bazinga.    Don't trust me, just watch and see as more of them get busted.   I really love it and it makes me happy.
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:49:01
I love it.  It sounds bold ignoring authorities.   Crypto casino's are illegal here in the US.   Your train of thought is interesting, but at these cash volumes, I'll posit and pretty much guarantee they will get caught.   Just like that thief in the Netherlands I think it was who stole from an exchange.   He thought he was free and clear.   But then the bank came calling on his girlfriend and him with unexplained cash.   they traced it backwards and found he was the thief.  2 minutes later he is in jail and being butt raped savagely.   It's was awesome to read about.
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:06:00
Just being transparent.  They will be caught.  The amount is just too large and someone always talks, especially to save their own ass.  I can't wait to see that happen here when thieving bitches pay.  I really really love that, and they always do pay it seems in this space.  Thank god for tracking and a ledger and KYC.   It's glorious.
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:55:14
No worries and appreciated the point for sure.   It takes real work from focused people; I made it sound simple.  I want to watch the thieves get caught and suffer along with anyone in their family who participated.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:36:11
Like I said though, unless you had lots of money in the past, that incoming cash will get you flagged.  As soon as they investigate origins, these fake users etc. will crumble.  It's really a thing of beauty.   I love that people think they'll get away with it.   New money always get questioned at that scale.     Trying to hide it inside a larger legit  corp entity might work but then you have to bring people in on the deal, and they always squeel to get out of their other issues they get caught for.  Or audits pick up something funny someone pulls a thread on.  Piper always come calling.
