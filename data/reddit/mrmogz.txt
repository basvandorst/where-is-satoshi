Here’s the idiot who hasn’t spent more than 15 minutes actually researching blockchain and cryptocurrency. Most money is already digital, you’re a fool to believe over the next few decades that it won’t transition completely into crypto. 
Will it be Bitcoin? Not likely, but it will be something scalable, fast, secure, and cheap to send.
@_date: 2018-08-17 13:36:49
Well, you’re entitled to your opinion even if it’s wrong. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:41:49
But you see no problems with the way your BTC overlords have FORCED all these "solutions" onto your precious bitcoin? Your choice.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:32:33
That's great that YOU consider it a p2p currency even though it isn't, and the fact is that these maximalists basically control, and make the decisions regarding bitcoin, not you.  
Edit: Oh god, I thought I was in r/cryptocurrency. Bring on the brigade of downvotes, hell, I'll probably get banned for not having a herd mentality.

Isn't that exactly what No Limit Fantasy is doing? I believe the games will be in their coin NLC2 but I'm sure cashouts or whatever would be back to BTC? I haven't overly looked into it, but I read they want to be the Draftkings/Fanduel of the crypto world.

No you don't have to immediately transfer. There are people that leave 5-6-7 figure sums on exchanges, albeit those are people who are day trading for the most part. If you don't plan on using X coin to trade though, get it off at your earliest convenience.

What's the point of Bitcoin being able to scale when all the top Bitcoin maximalists are telling us to use our credit cards and sell just enough BTC to pay off the debt, rinse and repeat. Since spending BTC is apparently a scam?!  
Late edit: Funny how this had a bunch of upvotes until the morons showed up to downvote it.  BUT BUT, MUH STORE OF VALUE, MUH DIGITAL GOLD!! Fucking idiots.

Because the maximalists that make all the decisions for BTC want it that way. The same reason they want it to be a SoV, and why they wanted those massive fees during the bull run. So they can sell people on the idea of a solution (see: Lightning Network, Segwit, Liquid) for the masses to think are necessary. Bitcorn has become cetnralized bullshit.

" I know I should just hold but that's not why I do this."
Pretty sure you answered yourself. Seems like you enjoy the rush it can bring, but aren't very skilled at it. Constantly selling at a loss to buy something else hoping for it to skyrocket doesn't sound like a great way to day trade.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:19:54
Honestly, it sounds like you don't have the personality of someone who should be doing any type of gambling. Just my opinion though, however if you enjoy it and do it with money that doesn't cripple you then have at it. 
Maybe you should try swing trading instead of day trading to still seek that rush but not be glued to a screen making bad moves with day trades.

Doesn't the money go to LBC in escrow for both parties? I thought it was set up so there can't be rip-offs.

For someone who knows how to trade I would imagine they could turn the $2k into significantly more than the inflation price of BTC. That being said if you just want to invest and have it be worth way more than the interest you'd earn at a bank, then BTC would probably do that quite handily. 
Set a goal of what you want out of crypto, do research and begin to implement plans to achieve that goal. 
If (when) BTC has a 500 billion market cap, each BTC would be close to $25,000. At the rate the market is increasing, that could be in the next few years.

Bitcoin has gone to shit. All the maximalists call spending it a scam FFS. It's centralized from a dev standpoint, and centralized again from a mining aspect as well. LN and Liquid are more centralized second layer pieces which push BTC further into the trash can. BTC was not meant to be a SoV or digital gold.  
Reading the bullshit on both r/BTC and r/Bitcoin is outrageous.

Can't take a train to the moon, bro.  
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:26:27
Pffffft, less than 5% isn't getting anybody a moon lambo! /s  
It really depends on how risk averse the person is, how much they're actually worth with funds to invest, etc. Many many variables.  
A college kid with $10,000 to his name isn't going to ruin his life/future if he invests $5000 into crpyto and loses it all. A grown person with a family, home, whatever amount of $ and they go and lose 50% of everything they've saved, that would likely be a much worse story than the college kid.

That's not even enough to cover the first night of alcohol that I consumed because of that decision. 
FTFY :P

Forgive my ignorance, but how is John McAfee against Bitcoin? Everything I've seen is him promoting it and crypto in general. Along with his ridiculous bet of BTC going to $500k in 3 years.

No and No! If he just wants to buy 0.5 BTC and store it away that isn't what he should do at all.
OP, set up an account with Quadricacx, it's a Canadian BTC exchange. Do a bank wire for whatever price you plan to pay for your BTC, or a little extra just in case. 
You will want to store your 0.5 BTC on either a hardware wallet or a paper wallet. That will be for you to decide and to learn how to do, but those are your safest options where the BTC is in your possession and not hackable online. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:30:15
So FOMO, FUD, noobs, weak hands = markets basically.

Exactly, the market needs these weak minded people. The concepts of buy low, sell high, and HOLD in times like this (or deposit fiat to buy on sale) is so basic, yet so many can't do it. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:46:19
Yes, the future of the worlds technology is going to go down to $0 because says so, without any real reasoning. Thanks for the insight, I'd better go sell my portfolio, thanks dude!
