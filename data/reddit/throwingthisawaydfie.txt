oh, duh. I thought you were a BCH supporter trying to ridicule BTCs inability to be used for smaller purchases. :) Makes sense !

:) I already made the decision to use the money to get a car for my wife which will be a HUGE surprise to them. If I had given it to them they would have sold it instantly and told me to do the same. So I kind of want to have my wife thank them for the new car and when they perplexily ask "what??" I chime in and explain.

HA! He recently retired and has been looking to buy an older SS to restore. Image if I bought one and put that plate on it.

He recently retired and owes about 22k left on his house. I am strongly debating paying their house off at least but I am still struggling to do. Not once in 2+ years has he been willing to objectively hear me out and try to have a civilized unbiased conversation. With anything. Ever. It's not a matter of convincing him of my opinion or not, but just having the conversation. I left the Mormon religion and was partially disowned as a kid for doing so and he still thinks Satan is why I left.

Trick question? I am Agnostic but because they have no idea about it even by their faith (mormonism) I would still go to heaven. lol

Appreciate this feedback. I needed to vent. And I needed sound advice to calm my mind.
