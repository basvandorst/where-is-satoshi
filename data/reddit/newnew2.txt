If Bitcoin comes under a 51% attack then it would not be secure  and the market would allow it to die. That's not a market failure.

You've already let on to your lack of comprehension no need to confirm it further.

No problem with that, I just had the question of how much that would be when I saw the headline, and thought other people would have the same question.

Free market includes consumer awareness, not "never speaking out against anyone"
Your straw is showing dumbass

I've actually never thought about bitcoin reporting in that context. Thanks for the expanded perspective.

Standard Oil could not keep up with demand and was losing market share before the trust busters broke it up. And at that point the price of oil had been lowered by 75% by Standard Oil.

Yeah let's set a precedent of manipulating supply for your short term value gains.

I think he meant off blockchain/on blockchain as opposed to BTC/USD. When the player deposits their "bitcoin" into a bank, then real bitcoin can be withdrawn.

For context. That'll net you a cool .002 BTC, about.

It's crypto-anarchy in action what do you expect.
"Yeah we made this entirely stateless tool but we still totally love the government"
Hell no, if you want to be pro-government then there are dozens of government currencies to choose from, this one is stateless.

Nah that money is better spent not going to core devs and lining the pockets of those actively pursing regulations against the Bitcoin community.

This isn't me, I'm currently tabbing between reddit and my X3 leveraged long position, but beyond speculators (which serve their own very important function), options at the fundamental level can be used as a form of insurance, exchanging a premium for protection against loses.

What I do is I take money that I would have spent otherwise and put it towards btc. 10% of my income does and always will go towards my low low cost index fund investments. After that 10%, I have a -100% expectation of return on all other money earned. Whether that be towards food, bills, clothes, entertainment. If you create budget space instead of pushing important things out, than you have nothing to fear from bitcoin. You could even do something as innocuous as stop drinking soda, and everytime you would have purchased one, spend that money on btc instead.
Full disclosure though I'm also still in college though so budgeting is way simpler for me. Point being, that do to the whole "to the moon" aspect of bitcoin, you don't need to really expose yourself to significant risk to be a part of it. That being said, sell everything you own and put it in all in bitcoin cus we gonna be rich bitttch.
