He’s recently updated his listing 2.14.2014, &amp; took his ph off the ad. **Support is non-existent from the site localbitcoins.com site and they have not pulled his ad.** Their forum is un-operative. I’m beginning to realize the entire site is a sham.

He’s got a sell ad up there even now.
I made a buy posting he contacted me and said that he just left from my state to do a large transaction. I spoke to the guy for almost an hr on the first call. We started talking at about 8:45am and around 2pm I had sent him fund for two coins, while on the phone with him the entire time. He verified my wallet address from our emails...then he said it was sent. I was online with blockchain and stated I didn't see it. He said he was moving it from his PC account to his online wallet and would send from their shortly. Then he said he had to run an errand with his wifey and would be back in a few. He freaking disappeared even though he’s still actively changing his ad on localbitcoins. This guy was good and I was a sucker first time buyer. I will try to prosecute. Any help from this site to find him is appreciated.
