Your info about transaction time and cost is severely outdated. Bitcoin has adopted SegWit, the transaction time and cost isn't that high anymore. Bitcoin is probably the most widely accepted coin for payment still, that's what gives it the most value IMHO, also all publicity gives it value too of course.

I don't believe it would be very complex for the government to move to 14nm if they were to build the machines themselves. 14nm Finfet already exists. All the companies you mentioned are just outsourcing the actual production of the chip, and so could the government. If companies worth a few millions can do it, then a trillion dollar government can do it just as easy if not even more easily.
A more compelling argument for NSA to create bitcoin would be to include backdoors, so they could spy on people doing shady stuff, while the target believes he's kind of anonymous.

No one told you to invest more, they merely said keep the pocket change in Bitcoin and forget about them for a couple of years and see where it's at then.
Investments in volatile markets are done long term.

Your funds (your keys) aren't on your phone. They are on the wallet service you're using, in this case [blockchain.info]( So if someone gets into that account, they can do whatever they like.
You made two BIG mistakes:
1. Stored your BTC/Money in an online wallet service.
2. Didn't activate 2FA.
Solution: get a hardware wallet to store the majority of your funds.

Why do you assume it's impossible to hack an account at [blockchain.info]( Especially if you just have a password and no 2FA, your password might have been leaked from other services in the past if you re-use it.

Do you have 2FA backup such as email/phone? Because that could be an attack vector since phone calls can be redirected quite easily. It sucks that this happened to you, but from now on, remove phone as an alternative, use your Nano S as a U2F device and get a backup hardware key from SoloKeys, Yubico or another Ledger device and set up U2F on your google account: [ Also, if you have an android phone you can use its built in hardware key aswell: [
You cannot rule out leaks from Google Photos aswell, NEVER again take a photo of your phrases.

I'm glad they don't see it as a threat. That means as he says they don't have to regulate it. And at the time they realize they need to regulate it because it threatens them, it will be too big to stop.

One of the affected currencies is SEK (Swedish money). Right now our interest rate is negative ( All (afaik) the banks has stated that they wont charge anything yet, but they can't say anything about the future. Most banks also don't have any fees except if you have credit/debit card on tied to the account. Some banks do charge for simply having an account, but they did that way before the interest rates were negative.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you never do have to expose any of your keys, right? Your address is a **hash** of your public key, correct?
Also your second paragraph:
"quantum attacks against symmetric crypto seem unlikely to be especially common. Bitcoin mining, which is essentially an "attack" against symmetric crypto, might never be dominated by quantum miners, for example, since traditional miners could very well always be faster and cheaper."
Which means QC isn't that much faster at hashing.

That would not be the reason to upgrade, as would be obvious to you if you watch the video. Only reason would be if someone comes up with a way to actually break sha256 itself.

I do understand moore's law. and it no longer applies. Ask Intel.
And even if it still applied, I don't feel like making the calculations on how many hundred years it would take to catch up and solve all the permutations of sha256 hashes in reasonable time. I'm sure Bitcoin will be dead and replaced by then.
