Thank you. There’s a future in bitcoins, but right now since it’s the Christmas period and many people are spending their Christmas savings, it’s worth shorting. Early 2019 would be a good time to buy up again. 
As that’s what one of my hedge fund contacts are doing but they are estimating probably March is a good time to buy again.

Okay sure, Ideally one of the problems I face is that after a person pays to a bitcoin address after the timer expires the payment doesn’t call back saying the payment has been received. Just thought I’d put that out as that’s the most significant problem I’ve had.

I work in partner with MirrorKingdom a online jeweller, I don’t get why people are getting so sour at me because I sell the btc to for usd, to pay my workers income with. I can’t really just pay them in bitcoins because half of them don’t know what it is.
