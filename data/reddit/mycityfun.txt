These will have a short shelf life, you need to make enough characters to fit million dollar pricing (preferably in tens at least).

What is this? The mainstream media is sounding like Andreas A. now, institutions are geared and ready to make their public moves.

Any potential loan amount + interest (student loan, remortgage) should be equal to the total amount you plan to dollar cost average over your planned time frame anyway.  In this context, you will gain the advantage of time, using the interest you are paying for the loan as the price for this time advantage.

Larger blocks increases centralization due to higher barriers of entry to running your full nodes. This reduces security.

Oh, I have a real life experience to share on this, travelled to China recently, went into a convenience store, every local is paying via Alipay or WeChat, the queue was moving at a brisk pace. When it was my turn, I yanked out the Visa and slowed things down by a whole lot, felt like a dinosaur with all the eyes staring at me waiting for things to speed back up again.
So speed really matters when everyone else is on it, the store might not even have enough cash to give you change in the future, so BTC with LN will be a vastly superior alternative to the centralized cashless systems used today.  Plus it is a non-sovereign, currency of the global internet.
Decentralized consensus is the litmus test, any whiff of centralization or gatekeepers - run for the hills [NO2X]
