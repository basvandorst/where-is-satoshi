It’s happening. Guess what guys, no businesses like paying 3% of the total sale to credit card companies. Do you know who feels threatened by this? The fat cats at visa, knowing their entire business model has a real threat of complete disruption. But keep the fud going, it’s really healthy.

What if bitcoin was always intended to be the one world currency? Mind blown. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:51:15
It’s literally mr robot coming true

You probably lost like $10. Cry. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:44:52
Man this subreddit is always filled with negative fud. Why even post? 
@_date: 2019-01-17 07:56:52
Less than one year old. Clearly most people here haven’t seen it. Thanks for your contribution.

Some people have high time preferences. Your loss

Now if only a non-poverty phone would implement this. Looking at you apple

Once one nation state adds a position in bitcoin, others will immediately follow too 
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:44:01
And letting credit card companies take 3% of every transaction 
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:19:05
Especially large amounts 
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:38:54
It’s a Honda. They only created the brand Acura to fool stupid Americans. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:28:52
I think this will help sway the poverty market a bit, but they don’t have enough capital to make a difference in overall volume. We really need the ETF approved for the big fish to enter.

This is a good thing. Haters need to stfu.

It's all good, I can see how what I wrote was ambiguous.

Move back in with your parents. Anything buy sell btc. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 07:59:32
He bought way more apple stock at near ATH too 
@_date: 2019-01-17 20:46:02
Yeah I know, I’m saying he has a high time preference since he sold. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:07:54
Past performance is not an effective indicator of future performance. 2015-2016 was a completely different time. 2019 will be bullish. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:05:11
When gold is at a standstill and bitcoin moons, you won't laugh. lol 
@_date: 2019-01-05 02:36:29
thanks captain obvious. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:08:09
It's not a lot right now, but it will be a ton in 10 years.

They aren’t mutually exclusive

Really smart move by coinstar to stay relevant. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:05:40


ETH has a lot of issues, most notably moving to POS. I would recommend sticking to just BTC. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 03:17:26
Welcome Russia lol. The time traveler reddit post mentions dictators as big players in bitcoin lol.

You sound really jaded. Maybe you should have held.  
@_date: 2019-01-17 20:47:33
And it outperformed every other asset class the last 10 years. Not everyone got into bitcoin at EOY 2017. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 04:18:37
Thank you for posting this! Bitcoin and austrian economics just go hand in hand. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 05:43:05
The most important bitcoin book someone could ever read. This really explains the economics behind all of money. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:26:45
It definitely is 
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:02:05
Probably Japan 
@_date: 2019-01-17 06:23:07
Bitcoin is more than a monetary symbol. It’s a revolution.

To the moon

Wrong. EOY 2020.

It will probably be a better retirement fund than a 401k.

@_date: 2018-12-29 21:26:56
Sheeple gonna sheep. It’s sad how short sighted most people are and how definitely they speak. It’s all based on the fact that they didn’t invest early enough in bitcoin, nothing else. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:12:07
With great power, comes great responsibility. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:13:40
Exactly, not everyone wants to be their own bank. As much as it goes against the idea of Bitcoin, it is a necessary evil for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:25:41
China skipped credit cards all together, they went straight from paper money to digital. It is definitely possible, but given how slow merchants adopted chip technology in pos terminals, I think adding bitcoin will take some time as well. Newer companies will probably add them upon creation. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:11:08
I have never kept anything on exchanges except for the actual trades, then I send them straight back. I get paranoid for the short time they are even on the exchange haha. Ledger nano's are great. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:09:53
The irony is strong here, champ. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:16:50
You can do payment escrows in bitcoin as well. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 02:39:21
Lets take advice from the guy down 98%. Alts are trash. Bitcoin is the only truth. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:06:43
Of course! Good luck lil' man. These are still early days, you are way ahead of the curve. To the moon!

No one knows. Just keep accumulating and try to get lucky with your timing. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:08:50
This makes me smile, I have more hope for our country if our youth know this stuff already.
