Well, that guy seem to have missed the last 50 years.
First Revolution: Steampower
Second Revolution: Production Lines (Mostly driven by Henry Ford)
Third: Automation
Forth (also known as Indstry 4.0): Computerization

On the other side i feel more confident for a EU-registered and regulated bank-like organisation holding my keys, because they can do this much saver and reliable than I ever could.
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:14:17
3rd industrial revolution is automation. It started in the 60ies.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:29:24
Basically more "teach how to teach yourself". Missed that a lot in school. Our history  teacher did that a bit, and while i hated it because of the bunch of homework we had, it was the most useful thing i learned after reading and basic mathematics.

But at the same time the power needed to mine one Coin goes up, or am I wrong here?
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:12:43
Depends on your industry. In Automotive EUR is winning clearly, in electronics China.
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:22:15
Still, this would be the end of it's mainstream use.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:14:31
Then: Had one. 5 years ago there was a Starbucks.
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:23:32
ERP integration?
Even in fully blown-up SAP it takes about 3 days to add another currency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:57:24
Aldi is 2€ (incl. taxes), however, spending a bit more (3-4€) you get something that tastes a bit like pizza.
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:52:55
Exactly. And of cause Starbucks in Venezuela!
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:18:21
I don't know, i'm not from U.S. I know there was prohibitiion and it failed. My guess is because 90% of the people were used to it.
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:05:53
Caracas Airport has one.

Magic Internet Money. A bit more precision please!
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:38:10
And how many Bitcoin i can get for this?
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:17:14
It's unlikely. US likes their cheap oil, which now has totally stopped.  More likely it's the Saudis seeing a good way to raise oil prices.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:54:01
Yes, would be my guess too. But maybe it's only 1, or even 0 less.
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:08:01
If the internet is down, life is worthless (if you look at a lot of people unter 30)
@_date: 2019-02-13 12:31:14
little BMWs are called mini ;-)
And Minis are not so mini, my clubman has the same trunk space as an Ford Kuga.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:31:25
Then he has  to pay taxes ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:41:42
Do you have a source for that? I would suspect to have to pay Kapitalertragssteuer?
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:27:39
Never invest money you can't afford to loose. Money you don't have in the first place ... you really can't afford to loose.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:50:22
I also don't think amazon will start offering bitcoin to the whole world at once. It would be more like "today pleople living in Spain get to buy books with bitcoin, next week we add CDs in Bulgaria and in a month small electronics in New Mexico". 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:36:15
i would add heating (depending of where you are).
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:13:17
Don't forget to close the windows!
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:37:48
Actually, our local church now is also taking smartphones together with old clothing, linen and stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:13:30
somewhere between 0 and 1 Trillion Dollars is my prediction. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:26:46
Also not, because the guy handling the cash, moving it to the bank wants to be payed too. Counting that and old ladies counting coins so you have to open another station it even is more expensive to handle cash than cards.

Twitter version:
Ver is evil, bitcoin will not care.
Luckyly enough we are on reddit, not twitter.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:19:03
Bitstamp has Official licenses in Europe to act as a bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:00:35
Just Bavarian ��
Thanks, that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:29:00
This was an expensive chicken. The trick was to buy an egg and raise the chicken yourself!
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:53:20
Depends. I would not  buy groceries for $30 and have a $30 fee on that.
I also would say, fees like Bitstamp (0,25%) is more than fair.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:54:19
I'm with you, same here. I think they can blame us when it's going worthless.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:30:38
So next: 1 Bitcoin NOW 3000 Cheeseburgers!
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:13:00
If you are in Europe, go with Bitstamp (i am myself, and quite satisfied so far).
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:09:23
Not by the Opener. He writes somewhere about a mercedes limousine.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:06:46
Pickup from Subway-Station, yes. pickup from the Airport way outside the City ... no.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:24:38
Well, you have to drive into the city ... should take more than 10 minutes. So if transaction does not confirm, he could just turn arround and set them down at the airport again. The view times this might happen are acceptable i think.
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:19:36
Then Lightning might be flawed, at least this is a considerable problem.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:32:00
Why think small?
Make it the AnyC - AnyCurrency".
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:29:04
Actually, this was confusing me also (for like 3 Minutes). We have to admit, it's not a 100% clear given "coin" is usually the smallest unit.
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:44:45
No, no, no. Best currency we ever had was fish! It comes out of the sea already laundered ;-)
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:24:54
Finns only accept icecoins.
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:56:32
Or at least prevent you from force-closing a channel when it's out of sync.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:05:46
He is not driving a bus. Read what he wrote.
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:41:34
This would also solve gun violence at US schools.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:19:59


Depending on the Hotel.  5 star hotel maybe. 4 star Marriott offers a service, 3 star Courtyard ... nothing i could find.
For vacation, i would not care about how to get to the hotel - public transport is just fine. But on business trips, where already have a lot of stress, a taxi or shuttle is just more convinient and worth the money.

Adding a check scan will easily prevent you from this.
