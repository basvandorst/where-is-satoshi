I agree, it would be just hard to illustrate my "moon" point with the whole observable universe.

Keep im mind that the shitposts are the fuel of bitcoin. Without them we wouldnt have come so far. Do not take them for granted bucko.

I apologize for yet another shitpost about BTC/USD value, but I had to.

Not a good way of thinking my dude. Just because someone didn't believe you 4 years ago about the success of Bitcoin as a currency doesn't mean jack. Hell, if you told me 4 years ago that Bitcoin would be worth 7.5k I would've laughed in your face, but here we are. It is all about risk-taking, and the fact that someone didn't take a risk like you did 4 years ago doesn't mean that they "ignored" you. Stop laughing in other people's faces for not investing in a unknown currency or they will be the ones laughing in you face when it crashes.

but why

No. When googling blockchain on spanish google, the first result is a blockchain.info add. You click on the blockchain.info add and it redirects you to a dyslexic blockchain website. Look at the highlighted link in the second picture.

As I mentioned in the post, I was using a new computer to access Blockchain.

I think the .info one is for the actual wallet and the .com is the company website, like a portfolio of their work. If I am getting this wrong someone please correct me.

Chrome, adblock plus.

Sorry for the late response but the fake website shows up as blockchain.info on google but when you click on it redirects you to the dyslexic version. The first link in my google tab screenshot is the phishing link.

Maybe because you are using the mobile to access the imgur website. On computer it shows up fine.
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:02:09
For some reason adblock didn't help. I had it installed when I took this screen.
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:01:55
Your point? This is still a huge safety issue. I am just trying to warn others.
