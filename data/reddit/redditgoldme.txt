This isn't a scam, i lost my 5+ year old reddit account with the gold credits still inside it, dunno how it happened but fuck it il be refunding your bitcoin or sending your gold soon.
There were a total of 13 orders 2 outstanding and the others were delivered, One of them being a 12 month one which i guess is yours right? i had mentioned we had only 2 in stock while you ordered that.
The other is DominarRygelThe16th's order for someone else a 1 month one.
I could have send DominarRygelThe16th's order before even deleting my account, it was not intentional i promise that.
I wouldn't scam for 30$ make much more than that and had plans,

My password wasn't secure could have been just deleted, i doubt a conspiracy is going on.
Waiting for the gold credits to arrive just now, will check back in a few hours.
(Been waiting for them for the past 15 minutes and i have to go work).
edit: took out the "lol" and also user d9-thc placed an order for 1 month (2.99$) yesterday.

Yeah i should have but i just came up with the idea and implemented it within a timespan of 1 hour though, just used that  account temporarily to do some testing for automatic processing.
