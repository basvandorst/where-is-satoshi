Buying bitcoins is gambling.

This shit happened in the 1990s as well. I personally know people who cashed in their life insurance and mortgaged their houses to buy stock in the New Market only to lose everything in the 2001 crash.
They laughed at me when I advised them to buy bonds. 
Greed is an amazing motivator and people will fall for speculation bubbles over and over again.

This is 2001 all over again. 
People laughed at me in 2000 when I told them to invest in bonds instead of buying stock on the New market.

Cool thing for those who made money on it but why would anyone invest in such an unstable "currency"? This is worse than stocks.
