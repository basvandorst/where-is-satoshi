Where you around in 2018...

But not when you are holding an asset that will go bust.

I think they will buy my Beanie Babies first.

I can value a stock by its expected return (ultimately based on the profits of the company and the dividends it can issue), currencies are non-productive assets and the only thing that makes them a store of value is their utility as a medium of exchange. So the question I think of is how needed this utility is (i.e. as medium of exchange). I think the answer is a lot less then the current value reflects. Further, the value of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange is problematic as the nominal amount of crypto (not just Bitcoin, but all of them) likely has to keep on increasing, meaning that for a given level of utility the constant increase would be driving down the fundamental value of individual coins or tokens. So while FOMO may drive up an asset, it does not affect the fundamental issues that the valuation of Bitcoin poses.

My back of the napkin technical analysis, which is far more sophisticated then your method, examines Bitcoin as a currency. When looking at the amount of goods it is used for and some multiple of that to account for growth, I still have trouble justifying a price over 3,500 USD per 1 BTC. And that is being generous. I put a stable floor on Bitcoin of about 1,000 USD per 1 BTC.

If you convert it to currency, it is a taxable event. If you exchange it is a taxable event. If you use it to buy something it is a taxable event. Not sure how it becomes a practical thing to use with such barriers (i.e. every transaction complicates your tax return for the year).

What is the name of your bank... I want to short their stock.

You know your argument makes no sense... If you had bought at 20k obviously you have no idea how to time a market and your selling and buying some more very likely would also have not worked out.

So long as the combined value of your cryptocurrenices (plus any other financial assets) held by foreign exchanges (or financial institutions) does not exceed $10,000 on a single day, you should not have any concern.

Any extrapolation you do of this should be carried forward a few years to see to what extent such extrapolation can even be possible. At some point the market cap of Bitcoin if you extrapolate using your data will exceed the market cap of everything in the universe... The point is that extrapolation this way must at some point fail. Can you identify when it has to fail? If not then any model built on this is pretty worthless.

You use a reasonable and consistent method of valuing the exchange. Coinmarketcap can be that. Or you can use the GDAX price. With the crazy price fluctuations there will be a lot of subjectivity here, but as long as what you do is reasonable and consistent there should be no issues.

I said it is worth at most in the 3,000 range. I thought it might be comfortably worth around $1,000. This got me plenty of grief. Frankly, I am not sure that there is a minimum value of Bitcoin, as by nature the total crypto market is an expansionary currency (i.e. the system works with new tokens being created. Not necessarily Bitcoins, which eventually stop growing, but for others there will have to always be growth). This means that since the currency supply is always growing the value must be always decreasing, otherwise you have an infinite growth in value. Based on that, there is really no reason to assume any floor on value.
