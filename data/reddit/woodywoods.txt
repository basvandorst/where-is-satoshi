Makes sense as Braintree HQ is Austin.
From September:
Braintree CEO Bill Ready announced the changes during a panel at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco on Monday, saying PayPal was looking to embrace the virtual currency and make mobile payments more accessible.

To clarify, associations such as Mastercard and Visa allow Sponsor Banks to use their network to perform transactions in partnership with processors like FIS.  The processors are similar to the miners of bitcoin in that they manage transactions. Program Managers work with Sponsor Bank to set velocity limits/level and have to follow CIP for AML/BSA as well as the Patriot Act.  Most Sponsor banks allow a prepaid debit card to be loaded ONCE and sold with a value load of $500.00 or less.  Further reloads to the card can not occur without first knowing your customer.  This is not an Associate requirement at MasterCard but at Federal Regulatory levels, Homeland Security as with the Patriot Act enforced by the CFPB and OCC of Sponsor Banks. Hope that helps.

It's an issue as old as customer service itself.  How does a company provide a great customer experience when the customer interacts with the lowest waged company resource via customer support?  It is certainly one aspect that many companies do not provide enough emphasis on quality monitoring or scripting as you see in this instance.  A simple script in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) provided to the Customer Service Representative and this post would have never happened.
This is probably a "Swivel chair" manual process in the Operations side of business outside of the point of sale or normal automated sales process.  As someone in the business world, this is a perfect example why more merchants don't use Bitcoin.  Because it is not automated in the Point of Sales, not understood by Support Staff, and it could potentially backfire with bad publicity by the Bitcoin community itself as in this example.
