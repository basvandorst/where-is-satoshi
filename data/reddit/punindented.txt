Hardware wallets provide a secure signing environment, you can't sign transactions with pen and paper (as in, is extremely unpractical).

Fair enough but it would be an interesting case if ASICs would have been fully deployed like it happens with major coins. I believe lack of consensus is somehow a proof of a certain degree of decentralization, but I agree the other way around is not always the case.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:46:42
Because is the most secure digital asset. The amount of current energy spending securing it and the fact that uses concise and thoroughly battle-tested code seals the deal, but then you can add it had the first mover advantage and probably the fairest possible decentralised initial coin distribution.

Some reasons:
- They have the largest attack surface due their many connectivity capabilities.
- You carry it most of the time, meaning you can lose it or you can be forced to reveal your keys if you go to the wrong place.
- Hardware is usually very poor in terms of quality, it's not designed to be robust but to implement as much features as possible at the lowest cost.

You don't understand how HD wallets work. The "D" is for deterministic, meaning you can recreate all the private keys and therefore addresses used by the wallet by just backing up the initial seed and the "H" is for hierarchical, meaning your receiving and change addresses (and accounts) are properly differentiated from each other. Just [inform yourself]( read the "motivation" part to understand why this is an improvement.

I think a big part of our lives as human beings are about doing stuff that we find meaningful, money is society's way to measure and limit how much participation in that stuff you will have, and while you can definitively have a meaningful life without any money, I must tell you you can accomplish much more having it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:04:39
It's a mistake because when you invest in bitcoin you're literally buying a chunk of participation in the economy of the future, the price in USD being merely an indicative of the demand for that chunk. If you sell now, you'll have less participation when (not if) you buy again in the future.

btc * xrp - doge = 34
btc + doge + eth = 6

@_date: 2017-11-21 12:52:52
If fees are implemented in relation to value transferred (I think they should given the limited liquidity), then it would make sense to transfer 75000000 satoshi (6 zeroes, not 4)  through the cheapest peer value/fee wise, and the remaining 25000000 through the other.

That's interesting, although what I had in mind was subsidizing segwit miners as soon as possible and during the blockade, so the longer it runs, the more advantage we'll be giving to segwit miners.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:47:12
I understand why you think that, but on the other side it would prove that BCH isn't "his vision".
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:37:41
There are two issues with this:
- Your transaction will be delayed until a segwit miner can include it in a block.
- Miners are not incentivised to do this due [increased risk of block orphaning](
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:56:21
Yeah, sadly subsidizing p2pool would be very wasteful. :-/
@_date: 2017-04-10 23:18:43
An idea to counter that could be to ramp up the subsidy amount the closest to segwit activation the network is.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:59:34
An idea to solve the issue with the delay would be sending first one copy of the transaction with a premium fee to your favorite miner or group of miners, and then send the same transaction with a smaller fee to the network. If the former gets lucky and finds a block soon, will get a small reward and the rest will drop the normal transaction from the pool. That could be implemented as default behaviour for any wallet without having an impact on confirmation time.
@_date: 2017-04-10 21:30:58
May we call it SegWitBOOST? :)
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:43:06
The service could instead offer to directly send some amount to the last segwit block coinbase address, that way it won't be collecting any btc. Anyway, I'd like to hear ideas on this subject!
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:01:08
Yeah,  is not really a problem, just that I don't know many users would be willing to do this, anyway we should help with anything we can do. Honestly I learned about  just yesterday, I didn't know miners were referencing tx ids instead of sending them but it does makes sense technically, maybe somebody who knows well how this mechanism works could tell us a bit more.
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:33:47
That's a good idea given we find a way to create such a pool, maybe a p2pool of pools? Sadly I lack the technical ability to implement this. :-/
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:02:37
Yeah, maybe you're right, I think I may be going with "TipSegWit" instead. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:45:59

You can make as many backups as you want but you're still the single point of failure in the system. Decentralization was introduced for that motive, and proof of work is the only solution to achieve strong consistency.

To be honest I'm not very interested into discussing "bitcoin's target" much further, actually every one of us believes it serves a slightly different purpose and that's fine for me. In any case I can agree with you on the point you made about the need for discussion between individuals with different skills if you agree with me that the resulting ideas can't be properly materialised into software without the software developers evaluation and commitment.

Sigh, Coinbase users always screwed over.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:45:42
While I respect your opinion, I also disagree with it. I think one of the reasons we're living inside a deeply corrupt system is precisely due the trust we put in central-authority approved professionals (exclude from this group "mission critical" ones like doctors or engineers). On the other side, programmers live in a global ecosystem that constantly tests their effectiveness (in many cases driving them to develop multidisciplinary careers) so I believe the society should be asking them instead the other way around (actually, this is currently happening as "software eats the world"). Also I don't think adjusting bitcoin to serve the general public would be a good idea, the priority here is being anti-fragile and only then mass adoption may come.

What you just read.

Correct, but allowing that process without resistance would quickly lead to centralization, and subsequentially to a POW change, starting the process over again. We want to extend the useful life of the current POW  as much as possible.

You're a good man, happy cake day! :)

Uh, I don't even know if it was discussed, but in any case I'm not sure what memory-hard POW function provides strong guarantees for the future so we won't suddenly have 10G blocks when somebody finds a way to build an ASIC for it.

But that's only because ethereum is a big hysterical joke.

It remembers me of  although there the author uses it as POW instead of vanity hex, but the idea is interesting to me as it could be a potential solution to the blocksize limit problem. If the network enforced it based on a separate moving difficulty parameter and the POW function were memory-hard instead of cpu-hard, then we won't need a blocksize limit parameter at all.

Don't delete it, maybe in the future you'll be able to spend it when/if fee pressure is released and/or the price of btc skyrockets.

Litecoin Foundation recommends to carry on, pay your taxes and don't ask questions.

Just try harder.

Not that I share OP's opinion, but prices falling is the direct result of currency value rising.
