This was the original reason why bitcoin existed. It seems like it has been lost with the recent greed. Of course there's money to be made but bitcoin was developed to be out of the scope of bank regulation.

So if I run a node and use the Lightning link they have on the site, I can transfer BTC with little to no fees?

What's the benefit of running a full node?

Use this next time you want to send BTC to anyone. This way you will know how long approximately your transaction will take with what fee.

Sarcasm. Someone was trying to send 0.0076 BTC and the fee to transfer the fund was 0.0056 BTC. So that someone was only left with 0.0019 BTC in the end. This is why you should always check what the fee is before you send anything.

Transfer fees are going up due to price increase of Bitcoin.

I use  to see how transaction fees are growing. So the recommended fee is 0.0010848 BTC which is roughly  $5. That's what I get from this. Hope this helps.
