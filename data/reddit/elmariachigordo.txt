15k is pretty enough to live by yourself, even in Lisbon. You just have to be careful with the rent, that's the main issue (isn't it always?)

True, Portuguese here too. If you have a contract company must pay you xmas and holiday bonus, so you earn 14 months in one year.

In the EU:
you will usually be considered tax-resident in the country where you spend more than 6 months a year
you will normally remain tax-resident in your home country if you spend less than 6 months a year in another EU country.
Even if outside the EU, if you are an American citizen in another country and are tax-resident there why should you pay US taxes?

But it is very common for companies not to give workers a contract and keep them in month by month paychecks, which do not grant you the "bonus" for Xmas and holidays. Sort of illegal but they do it the same. Hell even public companies do that (like the public national TV station).

According to EU law you would pay income tax in your country of origin.
But answering the first comment again, I just found out that the USA and Eritreia are the only two countries in the world with citizenship-based income taxes. So if you are and US-citizen, regardless of where you live, you have to file a tax report.. This is ludacrious, specially coming from a country with such a poor social state (medical care, public services, social security, etc.).
