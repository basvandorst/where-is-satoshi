The way those markets are set up is actually extraordinary. There is a messaging system, there is escrow to keep your funds safe until your order arrives, there is a review system where you can review the product after you get it, and there are numerous online forums where people discuss drug safety, the purity of the drugs from different vendors, and many many other helpful resources. These are things that you’ll never be able to get buying from a street dealer who gets their drugs from a cartel distributor. Plus, an online, anonymous marketplace takes away the risk of being injured and greatly reduces the risk of being robbed while purchasing these drugs. 
The biggest downside the markets have is how quickly people can import dangerous drugs for the intention of cutting their product. [Carfentanil]( is 10,000 times as potent as morphine and can kill A LOT of people. This drug, along with its weaker but more popular sibling [fentanyl,]( have been imported into the US at alarming rates recently.

What are you going on about? When I say “the state,” that is another term for “US government.” It does not matter what state he was prosecuted or sentenced in as it was US v Ulbricht (shown in the title of the case you conveniently linked). Federal investigation, federal charges, federal prosecutor. Nothing state based about it.
Furthermore, you can’t use a charge to determine a sentence unless you can PROVE it. Ever heard of the term “innocent until proven guilty?” Also, the charges must be proven “beyond a reasonable doubt” for a criminal case. If they truly had the charges to lock him up for these crimes, trust me, they would have.

No, they’re not. The state used this as a way for Ross to not have bail posted and as a way to get a harsher sentence. The charges and “evidence” were brought up but Ulbricht was never convicted for A SINGLE ONE of these charges.
