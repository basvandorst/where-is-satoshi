Finally a dude that makes sense.  Since you’re a veteran, I am curious if you’re feel like this crash is partly orchestrated by Wall st finally getting into the game?  To me it has all the hallmarks with all the trash talking etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if the banks are trying to manipulate the price by trading with themselves which would  be a big no no in ordinary securities markets.  
So my investment thesis is wall st is orchestrating a bargain for itself.

Many are asking how you came to be aware of this OP. Can you explain or point to any posts that explain? Also are you a govt investigator?  
I agree with the notion that moving to an exchange is for the purpose of washing the funds but the KYC laws make that a tricky endeavor.  My assumption would be an interested govt party would know all of that. So you’re likely just a person who likes listening to police scanners. :-) 
One thing I would be interested is whether some particular alt is going to pop soon for example polymath bc that would make me wealthy. :-)

I’m not a developer but have had a need to learn about Docker containers recently.  I used to be a network engineer so I have a Sys admin perspective. About 20yrs ago the virtualization revolution was kicking off as companies like VMware we’re finally getting traction.  Back then, if you needed more systems you had to order more hardware, wait for it to ship and be installed, ie months or weeks.  We actually installed operating systems if you can believe it. And then the database software and then the security software...insert disc 8, etc. 
Then VMware et al showed people how to spin up new systems virtually in a matter of minutes.  Over time this became the standard way of doing practically anything. 
Docker containers are the next step in the revolution (skipping the cloud phase) because they allow the system turn up to take seconds not minutes because they eliminate the system from the equation.  All you do is assemble your dependencies, put them in a container and copy paste them to kingdom come.  Built something on a windows system...want to run it on Linux or Mac? No issue.  Want your code to run on a system with tons of libraries out of sync with your system? No worries. 
You still have the issue of vulnerabilities so you should address those before patting yourself on the back. 
Anyway, just so we can understand this better, a few questions.  Is the idea that you could mine Bitcoins with containerized nodes?  How does that relate to GPU to ASIC, ie the need for faster computational hardware?   Or am I missing something as always? 
If someone takes up my questions can you also explain in terms of the current complaints about transaction times and high fees? Ie are docker containers at all an aid to those issues?

Stock charts have fractal properties. Google it. 
But the patterns that have jumped out at me is the seemingly continual head and shoulders leading to a reverse head and shoulders.  Google it.  
Maybe a simpler approach is keep an eye on the daily chart and take note, is it forming a W or an M?   It’s been pretty reliable for me.  Anyone else see this?

I’m sorry for your loss. A friend of mine attempted suicide one night and ended up getting arrested and 10yr prison sentence for assaulting a cop.   
When someone’s financial dreams are dashed, it can be pretty devastating.  Since it is Christmas season, seems fair to point out that George Bailey in Its a Wonderful Life proved that even one of the most beloved of people can feel abandoned, hopeless and suicidal. 
At one point or another we’re all looking for a Clarence to get us through the shit.   And we all know George Bailey type people who have succumbed to despair. 
It may not be popular in times of tragedy but maybe awareness would benefit from reviewing what are considered the seven deadly sins: 
Greed is one of them.  I suspect greed is a motivating factor of many bitcoin investors. Then again I know many involved in bitcoin aren’t per se greedy but slightly obsessed with it or astonished by it. 
I once worked with the Army suicide program. They had a decent handle on the retrospective analysis of suicide but had trouble nailing down the predictive signals. 
Usually, the person had a troubled history, was not religious, and recently made a major change—like moving to a new base or back home etc.  Then they’ll get in trouble so like an arrest and all the trouble that causes becomes overwhelming and yeah, end their lives.  
I learned that there is no magic bullet but having strong ties to friends, family and community greatly decrease the risk.  Everyone reading this should think about their own lives and connections to others because truly they represent life’s only everlasting treasure.  That, and snorting coke off a hooker’s tits.     
Ha, j/k, my post and this topic is sort of somber so hopefully someone laughed at that.  If you laughed, there’s hope!  Peace to all going through tough times!

I think you’re thinking about this in the right way but there’s a fundamental issue that arises: is Bitcoin a currency or just a payment system?  It can’t be a currency since that requires a nation or group of nations to control.  (Yet many hype it as such).  
If it is a payment system then it should trade as a fraction of existing payment systems in part because of the value of networks (like AOL in terms of subscribers or visa/MasterCard in terms of transactions.   
When you frame it as a payment system you have to accept the warts (currently high fees and slow transactions).   
I know you said you are a trader and I’m talking about it as in fundamentals. So slight disconnect there.  But I think what I’m saying is the foundation of why this is a global phenomenon.  It will make less sense to us in the USA than to those either under strict regimes or under toy governments whose fiscal policy is essentially self enriching.  
I researched the shit out of bitcoin before I invested in August. I have a background in payment tech. I wish I had learned about it sooner because it really is amazing technically even with the warts.  I threw $30K at it. Bought some of that in a dip that took a few weeks to sort out.  Up about 3X.  
I will likely buy more on Monday.   As a trader You should know that stocks that have performed the best historically also have had the highest volatility.   
Oh one last thing. My next investment around crypto will be in mining.  If you get a chance spend some time with those folks...whole different view of the universe and they tend to try and keep things quiet...like kids up past their bedtime with muffled giggling so they don’t wake their parents.

I couldn’t listen to this idiot for too long.  It reminds me of idiots who defend themselves in court and don’t understand criminal discovery laws which force th govt to release evidence to the defense when they request it.  I don’t know federal criminal procedure but a pro se defendant should be able to request discovery by writing a judge a letter that simply says, “I request all of the evidence held by the state in regard to my case. I ask the judge to hold as inadmissible any evidence withheld from me in preparation for trial.”    In comparison, I’ve read attorney requests for discovery and they go on and on for paragraphs asking for every possible thing in particular.

I agree with OP's assessment but the foundational fact in all of this that China can't make bitcoin useless, obsolete or disappear. Technologically it is impossible.  
Even if China said anyone possessing the currency gets the death penalty wouldn't prevent it from being a store of value.  
If you are China or any govt, you gain control through regulating the system. But even that affords little control. Instead it provides a modest means to audit what is going on.  That's the best they can ask for.  
I'm not an anarchist. I think a bit of regulation actually adds to the legitimacy and overall increases the number of users which is what ultimately causes the value to go up.   
Just my opinion.

It has been debated since the beginning. It is a store of value and a payment system.  Personally, because my early career was in credit cards, I immediately got the benefit and especially liked the “possibility” of micro transactions (which I learned later is probably better handled by other coins).   So I lean towards value deriving from being a payment system. 
I get the store of value claim but obviously the biggest issue is dilution via forks.  Forks are like schisms and schisms attack overall value based on network effect. I would t be surprised if many shitcoins are govt sponsored.  If I were in a threatened govt, that would be the easiest attack vector.  Only one who benefits from a shit ton of shit coins is a shit exchange who gets paid by the toilet flush.  Hell, govts probably spearheaded some of these forks.  No brainer.

Let’s expand this topic. Suppose Congress appropriated funds to the agencies in bitcoin or according to a blockchain (either one).   You see the funds going in to an agency and all of the funds coming out of an agency.  
But agencies and DoD can’t do that today.  Explain to me why this wouldn’t be a significant improvement. Consider another angle.  If you are a Congress person and have heated funds for something like a road...how hard is it to track those funds and verify they were used for the road? 
I agree with the idea that all federal funds should be trackable with a blockchain and I can think of a reason why bitcoin couldn’t be used.  
What we should be doing is selling Congress on the transparency they have been denied for decades due to fiat and legacy accounting...
