Exchanges have to do better than this. That is just embarrassing. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 21:57:00
So...you're saying there's a chance?

Amazon items, Ebay items, more retailers!
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:27:06
More positive news for Bitcoin :D
@_date: 2014-08-17 23:08:56
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:36:31
Congratulations! Provide some feedback!
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:23:26
Because we need more use, not more investment!
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:25:03
Adoption is the route to value! 
@_date: 2014-08-16 19:11:26
Bitcoin may be global but the financial system is highly centralized. Fiat rules the world, currently. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 11:13:53
We need more folks to step up, nodes mean health!
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:08:29
Awesome, thanks for sharing RushWallet!
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:35:39
How much success have you enjoyed that you attribute solely to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-08-23 13:34:02
@_date: 2014-08-09 18:32:20
Interesting, many Bitcoin users will surely love this.
@_date: 2014-08-23 17:33:16
Circle has rave reviews so far, hopefully this momentum keeps up!
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:11:42
That's pretty poor customer service, disappointing from BitStamp!
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:24:06
Crypto is the future, but it doesn't have to replace everything else!
@_date: 2014-08-26 00:30:39
Then Amazon will stay on their current track and wait to accept BTC when they are confident in the supporting community. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:35:02
Bitcoin needs robust professionals, that means balancing all facets of life. Suicide isn't the answer :(

Love. Peace. Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-23 13:36:03
Bitcoin can solve many problems, but first Bitcoin has to be adopted more widely!
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:34:39
Great news for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:02:25
Fiat currency, is what I mean. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 22:10:54
Awesome, everyone enjoys a drink at the end of the day. Especially if one can buy it with Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-08-25 12:04:06
Work for it!
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:03:01
Awesome! That's great news!
@_date: 2014-08-23 01:11:11
Full cycle Bitcoin exchanges are good news, yay Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:41:15
Where is the price going and why?
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:18:35
Chase has a poor track record with the Bitcoin community, no surprise here. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:35:54
It happens. Managing the flow of fiat to crypto to users and all the internal exchanges is not easy. Be patient. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:27:24
A split isn't the answer. Does gold "split" when the value of an ounce increases? 
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:37:54
Hire people you trust! And don't enable any single person to withdraw significant funds. Even the boss!
@_date: 2014-09-01 13:41:59
Adoption is valuable only if it is followed by use. Will Bitcoin users make adequate use of Whole Foods offering this service?
@_date: 2014-01-22 09:21:17
Thank you!
Yes, we have an API. hitbtc supports streaming API over WebSocket. You can find documentation here: 
Please let us know your thoughts and do not hesitate to contact us in case you have any questions.
@_date: 2014-08-28 21:25:13
Newegg is fantastic!
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:56:14
Neither, we hope! We have listed a new BTU coin, available for trading, before all in the whole world. And we haven't locked people's funds. We only have temporarily shut down the BTC withdrawals. But BTC is available for trading, and all other currencies are perfectly withdrawable.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:55:29
According to coin.dance/blocks, it makes sense to expect hard fork in the nearest future. Should it not take place before Friday, we will select one of possible solutions with the help of our community.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:53:27
There's no guarantee that after the hard fork new network would be safe from replay attacks. Also the date of hard fork approaching is unknown. That's why we decided to take measures in advance, in the meantime providing our community with an opportunity to store their BTU securely before all.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:28:06
That is the only way to protect their funds. Leaving the possibility of losing assets because of replay attacks would be a real dick move. Please note that BTC is available for trading, so it's possible to withdraw your funds in another currency.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:09:10
Please check this out: coin.dance/blocks. The BTU segment in the last 144 blocks is growing on a daily basis. And this is the voice of the miners - those who are building the network.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:19:56
We believe that listing Bitcoin Unlimited before all, available for trading, is even more epic! So we did it. In this case temporary BTC withdrawals shutdown is simply unavoidable measure, aiming to protect our users from replay attacks.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:54:05
Our customers' bitcoins aren't confiscated. They are available for trading, so it's possible to withdraw these funds in another currency, for example.
In case of hard fork not taking place before Friday, we will publicly discuss with our community, what kind of action should we take.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:10:51
HitBTC here. We are extremely sorry for leaving such an unpleasant impression! Allow us to explain ourselves.
If the event of hard fork not taking place before March 31st, we will arrange a survey and let our community decide, what to do next. None of your assets will be lost.
Please note that only BTC withdrawals are locked at the moment, the rest of the exchange operates as usual.

Dear [**SatoshiBrother**](
KYC is an important procedure that ensures our platform is not being used for money laundering or as an intermediate in fraudulent schemes. After you've provided us with the requested documents, it usually doesn't take that long. 
Please share your support ticket number in order for us to provide you with a follow-up, thanks in advance!
@_date: 2018-10-12 10:39:33
KYC stands for Know Your Customer - sometimes we use client's facebook account to make sure he's a real person and not an alias of a cybercriminal. It's not compulsory in any way.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:08:07
Wow. We have notified our engineers about point 2, and will discuss point 1. Thank you. Trade happily.
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:30:47

@_date: 2017-08-03 16:10:09
Could you please share your email with us? We'll check out our logs. It definitely shouldn't be like this.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:30:30
We'll be glad to help you. Please provide us with your transaction hash and your email address, and we will refund your money to you.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:36:38
You're right. Sorry about that.
(But still, for a lot of traders we're about to become the first place to try SegWit :))
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:19:59
HitBTC here. We are extremely sorry to hear that you've had such an unpleasant experience, and we would love to help you to locate your coins! Our support team had received your request and our reply is already in your inbox. 
According to the logs, HitBTC did its part correctly: your transaction had reached the network and had been included in the block. In case your coins had never reached the destination point, it makes sense to contact the support service of the receiving party. Have you tried it? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:58:21
HitBTC here. Hi! We are sorry about leaving such unpleasant impression. Please allow us to clarify this issue and tell the whole story, which hopefully is able to change your opinion.
**March 24th**: we are getting ready for possible Bitcoin hard fork upcoming, providing our traders with a new trading instrument at the same time. [Here's]( our announcement: we have credited our traders with BTU, introduced BTU/BTC trading pair and temporarily locked BTC withdrawals to protect from possible replay attacks.
**March 31st** is the established deadline: hard fork didn't take place, so we have have started a [vote]( as promised. We let our traders to decide, what happens next.
**April 4th**: our traders have said their word, and we have [designed]( our course of action accordingly. BTC withdrawals had been unlocked without any restrictions, BTU/BTC trading pair remains active, and BTU is going to be transformed into Ethereum tokens soon.
