Buy high, sell low. That's the true secret.

It will just be his dick pics but with the names of senators drawn on him in ballpoint pen.

I feel like this guy just stole some of my life. People *"literally"* watch this shit?

`Accumulated PoW ~ Trust`


Not relevant. Apples and oranges. Only another Apple can take the place of an Apple and once one Apple has it's place, no other Apple can take that place. This is the reality of blockchain. First mover is the only valid chain. Forks are minorities. Other technologies are other technologies.
You can invent a better thing, it won't be Bitcoin. Bitcoin will always remain Bitcoin until the end of the human race. The majority chain, is the majority chain. You're welcome to innovate all you like but that base reality can not be changed.

Maybe if the screen was flashing red, had a bold white title **"IMPORTANT"** and was playing an alarm tone on the phone.
Nah. Just skip that page! ;)
People having to take responsibility for themselves is one of the larger impediments to adoption. It can't be fixed in the UI. The average person just isn't equipped for thinking on their own, or at the least would like someone else to take responsibility for it.
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:13:21


Bitcoin isn't Apple.


Escalated quickly.

You failed to realise he's nothing but a saleman selling his wares. The whole thing is nothing but trolling for attention.


Or he's selling shit to plebs.
You're watching adverts and thinking they're real.

Is why you constantly see Perth Mint Lunar coins selling on eBay with a premium over cost.
You can't buy them without registering with the mint, but you can buy them anonymously on eBay.

For anyone else curious, here are the warnings on the wallet creation screen:
@_date: 2019-11-09 00:51:29
Godmods over there. Don't even bother attempting to participate in any normal discussion. It will end up censored and you'll just have wasted all your effort.
Unsubscribing is the only logical move.

2017 wants it's relevancy back.
No one cares.

The whole thing or just pieces?

It's got a flow which kind of keeps you watching, but then there is no payoff, apart from better algo rank with youtube for him.

It's almost like they're intended as a physical backup.
@_date: 2019-11-12 04:50:53
Why would I trust any of them?
Closed source.
@_date: 2019-11-09 00:58:23


That's not how any of this works.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:56:01


So fiat should beat PoW based cryptocurrency over time then right?
Bitcoin is the greater of the two ponzi's. It's perfect and will suck up all cash until all cash is gone.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:25:36
Sooner or later inflation becomes hyper-inflation next to it's base pair BTC. At some point printing more becomes so much of a losing proposition that it can't be sustained without losing incumbent power. 1BTC = 1BTC
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:53:09
Don't forget the people who die with coins immutably held forever. 
It's the best ponzi ever! A better ponzi than fiat currency, so much of a better ponzi that it will eat other ponzi until there are no ponzi left.
It's the perfect ponzi, hard coded and assured.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:51:25
Or they do.

` --force`
nuff said.
I `rm -rf /` all the time!
@_date: 2019-10-24 00:33:03
`--force` = *"I really really want to do this thing you just warned me against, I fully accept the risks as I know what I'm doing and have decided that I wish to force this"*
@_date: 2019-10-24 00:30:51
Seriously? You just force closed on a whim with funds which weren't just gravy you had laying around but belonged to other people? WTF.
@_date: 2019-10-24 00:37:11


When someone types `--force` into a command dealing with 4BTC of investors funds on a whim, that's an entirely appropriate call.
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:05:39


So you're still ignoring that you're wrong and that using an old backed up state is a bad idea?
No, you're not right. You're wrong. 4BTC was lost as proof of how wrong you are.
@_date: 2019-12-22 23:02:42


It doesn't matter how many times you shuffle the deck, it's the same deck.


*"In time analysis will show exactly where it went"*


By seeing the entire state of the system including all the things hidden to the end user.
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:46:46


@_date: 2019-12-19 22:43:24


Not with the naked eye at a glance. 
I don't think you understand that states had an interest in building tools to deobfuscate the spaghetti. All connections from the begging to the end are in the clear on the ledger to be seen and analysed. Number of inputs/outputs is near irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:45:01


Obfuscation is not security. No matter how many times you shuffle the deck, it still has the same cards.
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:57:17
@_date: 2019-12-19 05:44:17


It doesn't.
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:12:13


Privacy = Security of personal information.
Obfuscating the source of coins to cursory analysis, through shuffling techniques does not actually protect anything from detailed automated analysis.


Mixing is shuffling.


Everything is uniquely identified. 


So what you're saying is that every transaction is linked to every previous transaction? That these threads can easily be traced at all times?


Gold I can sell on ebay, mix and melt different compositions and remove all chain of custody information.
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:19:16
Whatever you say buddy. Keep mixing and believing that provides you with anonymity all you like.
@_date: 2019-12-20 00:15:04


No reward. No thanks.
I'll leave that task to the IRS, they have the tooling.


Doesn't matter. Only where it ends up matters.
@_date: 2019-12-20 23:11:15
It's all connected. 
You have to realise that those surveilling also have access to exchange logs. It's entirely possible to connect all threads from one end to the other. Your $XXX is still $XXX. Investigators like working with blockchain, makes their job easy.
You can't hide in plain sight.
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:59:57
*"Mixing"* on a public blockchain is entirely pointless. The whole ledger is there to be seen.
Lightning Network is P2P and private.
