This is what happens when you spend the entirity of  your life trading. Your mind is fractured in uncountable ways

I feel like I have this

Strange to think that in the last 2 years $10+ billion worth of bitcoin has been mined. Must have been absorbed somewhere.

I went into chase once with a $10 recurring payment I needed to get cancelled. Basically said "help me get this cancelled, or I will close all my accounts"
I ended up closing all my accounts.
They said I needed to contact the vendor to stop the recurring payment. Except the vendor had no customer service except for email, and I had to use the email associated with the account, which I did not know/lost access to.

I just hope that it continues to do whatever it is that it is doing now that makes it an undoubted success.

almost all numbers are greater than the largest number ever imagined by anybody

Same argument was made numerous times in 2015/2016 except with 2017 replaced by 2013.
Bitcoin is fine as it is today and is a success even if it stays at current prices.

I will give the opposite opinion: In order to maintain any value it can't solely be a "technical superiority" thing. Technology always improves and any good open-source cryptocurrency can be copied endlessly with slight improvements that should make the original obsolete, ad infinitum. You can argue network effects, community, etc. but overall you would come to the conclusion that technically inferior products will be overrun by technically superior products if this is the only benchmark we look at.
You can attempt to apply this to "bitcoin as digital gold" as well, but as you and many others mention, scarcity for the sake of scarcity alone is not enough! What makes bitcoin different is that it was the first decentralized digitally scarce "thing" and it has a huge advantage over other, lets call them "scarcity coins", because of its associated network effect. The total supply number is arbitrary (42 coin), supply schedule is arbitrary, etc. We saw this all play out in the 2013 altcoin bubble when dozens of coins with different scarcity variables emerged. Notice that they did not detract from bitcoin. No altcoin has arguably better "scarcity variables" than bitcoin. Furthermore, I can't copy bitcoin 10 times and make bitcoin2, bitcoin3, etc. and then argue that the price for all of them should converge to 1/10 the current price of bitcoin. Well, you can argue it but the market will not support that argument. Again, this is evidenced by the 2013 altcoin bubble.
This makes bitcoin, in my opinion, the only coin immune to becoming technically obsolete; it is no longer competing on a technical level and does not need to which is evidenced by it still being the  crypto by market cap. The need to compete on a technical level will actually be the downfall of most coins, in my opinion.
You definitely have the right to disagree (and the market is a good place to hash out these competing opinions), but this is my opinion and the conclusion I have come to after trading this stuff for nearly a decade.
TLDR: Bitcoin need only be technically "good enough" to succeed because it does not rely solely on it's technical properties. Altcoins need to be technically "the best" in order to succeed, and this is much more difficult to achieve and makes them much riskier investments.

What it would need is to stabilize and slowly crawl its way back to $20k. If it broke through $20k the media would hype it up and it just may hit $100k. But im not going to to hold my breathe. plenty of other investments out there.
