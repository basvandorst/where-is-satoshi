Are we talking about the same interview on CNBC's Fast Money where he also talked about his new prediction in April?
From around 6:30 in; 
- All that energy is focused on BTC and all of the crypto's around it
He is talking in broad terms about the block chain tech and how nobody would almost know how to handle FIAT (and he then mentions Starbucks) five years from now.
It's a erroneous and tabloid headline - if it is indeed referring to the interview from CNBC above.

You are aware that the mafia, corrupt states etc. are all indeed deep in FIAT, right? They are actually as we speak using FIAT to do dark deeds. 
I just don't get these arguments really that crypto is this safe haven for bandits, compared to FIAT etc., as they completely seem to neglect the fact that money, whether stocked in paper, metal or data always have been, and will always be, misused by same said bandits..

That he's off to the moon in a lambo.. perhaps?

He talked about crypto's in general didn't he? Pretty sure he did.

It's like that one time when John Snow knew nothing.. we are all like him. We don't know anything. Not a single clue have we got really.
But we are having good fun, and that's important.

This could be the beginning of "The Coin War" which by all means would be preferred to the cold one..
