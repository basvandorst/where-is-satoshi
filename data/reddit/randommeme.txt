Still looks pretty inconvenient to be honest.

evidently the FBI, prosecutors, federal court, and even Shrem's legal team disagree with you
However, it's not illegal to buy/sell small amounts of bitcoin, no one (certainly not me) is claiming it is.  Selling $1mil USD worth is a different story.

funny, that's the first time I've used my bitcointip.  Even though I set it up months ago, I used my doge one right away.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:04:29
great. what does this have to do with exactly? 
Beyond that, this is a pretty stupid rant, why are we upvoting this?

law doesn't exist? When did this turn into the sovereign citizen subreddit? 
He was charged with a number of federal offenses.  Even if you think the laws are BS you still go to jail for breaking them, sorry to burst your bubble.

so that is what Peter Schiff said about bitcoin (among other things), why hasn't it been replaced by litecoin/peercoin/etc? 
perhaps it's not the name or technology that really matters here, maybe it's the community of users and developers that actually make all the difference? 
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:09:52


sounds to me like they want someone who can understand cryptography from the theory side. I expect that means a Masters or PhD in math. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:54:57
funny, really feels like there is a lot of influence here. Ironic you're getting downvotes.
fwiw, "checkout is always at the top of newb dogecoin threads.

yes. redundancy is a pretty key principle in all storage systems, even a single hard disk will store information in a way that can recover from sporadic failures.
@_date: 2014-08-26 07:39:35
and if your drive fails? or your computer is stolen? the point of cloud storage isn't about more storage capacity, per say.

This sort of thing is exactly what prevents mainstream adoption. What percentage of the world population has the desire and skills to do what you suggest. 
And this is rather simple advice, nothing like the standard advice to never use web wallets etc.

could probably pick that up on the way to the interview also

I'm missing the context here, I know Ghash is near the 50% mark but I don't get why they are deliberately trying to bitcoin.  Are the miners that make up the pool really to blame here? and why are they joining this pool, are there advantages? 
edit: yes there are advantages, basically less variance and easy to use.
@_date: 2014-08-26 19:30:18
It doesn't work that way, interestingly you only need 2x the space for near perfect error recovery! Here is a cool explanation (gist at 58:30):

the amount of ITT is fucking painful. 
Yeah, it's kind of BS, but not really, I mean he knowingly broke the law after all.

How is this different from suggesting that all individuals immediately withdraw all their cash from the bank and stuff it under their mattress to ensure they actually 'have any cash'?
In my case, and I suspect many others, I'm more concerned about losing my bitcoin by losing the physical data on my phone/laptop. What's the best alternative for storing wallet information in the cloud behind reasonable security measures, i.e. 2FA?
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:33:05
for a while? You mean since December 17th, not even 2 months?
@_date: 2013-08-11 21:54:11
If you're in the US it's pretty straightforward for people to buy BTC from coinbase.com. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 23:20:56
The difficulty of mining is set to adjust the rate at which coins appear. If the value drops significantly and miners shut down, the difficulty will drop appropriately.

It's cool, but you have no content other than the ads, this worked for milliondollarhomepage.com but not for the thousands of clones that came later. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:08:49
try coinbase.com, it's a very easy way to get started.

use lastpass or onepass, it encrypts all your passwords with a master password, and it's very convenient and allows you to use unique randomly generated passwords for each site. 
Also, it auto-fills your login password when you go to a site, so if the domains look the same but don't match, it won't auto-fill.

It's actually not clear whether bitcoins use in, say, Silk Road is good for the value of the currency in the end.  I mean, consumers like it and it is clearly adding value as we speak 
But, if it's declared illegal in the US for example, with politicians peddling a "think of the children" style argument, the value of the currency would reduce substantially.

Is this really the account that was 'seized' presumably by capturing the private key, wouldn't it be prudent to move the coins to another account, incase the SR admin had a backup?
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:50:54
I think: 
@_date: 2013-09-13 13:28:05
ah, makes sense, the attacker never had access to the private key for that account.  Also, this implies he really stole the money from them, not you.

Is the guy really that great? I mean he is just trying to cash in on the lucrative drug market. I hope you wouldn't advocate the dealer down the street be upheld as some kind of hero.
