I’m surprised this kind of stuff doesn’t get taken down 
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:20:29
Shit you right

Your comment. They weren’t trying to be funny, they really mean this and they don’t get the context

The housing bubble had nothing to do with people starting businesses

He just has a different opinion than you, no need for pity. Do you think that people starting businesses is a bad thing?

10k yesterday, 11k today.... yeah I can live like this

It's definitely going to crash eventually, but not yet. I personally think it's going to hit 10k some time early next year, and I plan on selling then.

What are private keys?

Guilty. Panic sold some when I saw it dropping, I know I'm going to regret it, but for now  I'm waiting for the price to keep dropping in hopes of buying some back...

I feel like a rock for asking, but what does hodl mean? Did someone just spell hold wrong and it stuck?

I'm in the same boat as you. It looks to me like the only reason that cryptocurrencies have any value is because people want them, there's no intrinsic value to a bitcoin. I'm curious to see how long people can keep the price of it up, but I wouldn't be surprised if in a year or so it drops off the face of the earth. Interesting to see everything that's been built around it though

Yeah just in buying/selling, I've been mining for months. Bought it back lower though so not too worried about it

I'm newish to this sort of thing as well, but I can tell you right off the bat that buying and selling is very easy, and that only buying a few hundred isn't going to turn into anything spectacular. I've done that exactly and only made 15-20 bucks. Personally, I feel like right now would be a better time to invest than the end of the year, because the price could just keep going up to 10,000 by the end of the year. Hard to say, and admittedly I'm just speculating, but that's my two cents.

Probably a dumb question but how can I access my Bitcoin gold? I know I needed to have some in my account before the fork, I just didn't know how to get to it 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:16:58
Why is one bitcoin worth $6000?
