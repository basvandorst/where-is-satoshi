Maple bacon for less than $3.00 a package?! How is this possible...
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:02:01
Those items are the same price... $637.50
The overstock price quoted is MSRP
And the amazon price quoted is not in USD

That reporter didn't have a chance. Classic misinformed skeptic.

It was glorious!
I've bought some bitcoin, transferred it to wallets, given it away as Xmas gifts (to a couple of carefully chosen friends), and even used it with gyft to buy movie tickets. 
It felt real good, and I just wanted to say thanks to all the people contributing to this sub. You all have helped me to see this technology is real, far more than just a good idea. 
I am super excited for the future of Bitcoin!!

**TLDR: crypto is real, it has potential for misuse, we've got our eye on it moving Forward**
I am impressed with this guy. He spoke fairly well about the topic. Seems like they are being very cautious, making sure bitcoin doesn't unravel the web they've carefully woven to catch wrong doers. 
On the whole: Good News.

Seems like you are pointing toward at a tainted coins scenario. That can't happen.
Tainted coins = decreased fungibility 
Lower prices = better entry point for n00bs = equals increased adoption = moon landing

Coinmap.org = exactly what I am looking for. 
Thanks!

There is a bright side. This is an indictation Bitcoin has penetrated another demographic. 
Glenn Beck is a joke, but he has an audience. More people will be scratching thier heads at the thought of BTC. This is good.

"News" from China, people are panic selling. 
**Good time to buy?**
Only invest what you can afford to loose.

I missed it! When does he mention them?

Coinmap is the bomb.
