Your mentality is holding "us" back, yes.  I don't care how long you've been around and don't give a shit who you are.  This is a meritocracy.  It's what makes the technology and community great. Re-read my post--it's quite clear that what I'm arguing is that your mindset is what is holding "us" (the bitcoin community and bitcoin in general) back from gaining great user adoption. When someone who is part of the 'establishment' actually starts taking bitcoin seriously, you shit on them because they either haven't been around long enough or because they haven't said enough (care to quantify?) about bitcoin to meet your self-imposed litmus test.  . That's the point.  And that's the problem.  I have no inferiority complex.  Your superiority complex, however, is not only unhelpful in spreading the BTC gospel, gaining mainstream support and increasing user adoption, but it's also likely why the closest you've come to getting laid in the last who knows how long is that special sock lined with vaseline you keep next to your spare 20 sided die.  
Let's be totally clear though, since you obviously haven't done any reading up on this guy at all: He apparently has $30 Million in the bank and has a double digit lead in the race.  Allow me to translate into binary: He will win, his opponent will lose.  He is the next Governor of Texas.  And the next Governor of Texas is endorsing Bitcoin.  Doesn't seem like he's begging for your donation to pay for his campaign.  Seems like he's learned about Bitcoin and likes it.  And is now helping legitimize it, in his own small way, by accepting it as a form of contribution. 
So, either get off your high horse and support those who are helping push bitcoin to a larger community in a positive way (this doesn't require donating, btw), or, like I said the first time, get the fuck out of "our" way.

The $30M isn't his personal wealth.  It's what his campaign has reported as what they have on hand to spend on his campaign from donors in fiat currency.  Your ignorance of how campaigns operate is astounding.  
To your "point", the original post indicated nothing more than notification to the bitcoin community that he is supporting bitcoin by way of accepting donations in that form and putting out a press release in support of bitcoin as a cryptocurrency.  He didn't solicit this subreddit for donations.  That's what you turned it into.
The point still remains that the next Governor of Texas has expressed an endorsement of bitcoin.  It's the type of thing we as a community should embrace because it helps encourage more mainstream adoption via legitimization by someone who is part of the 'establishment'.

Not particularly, no.  But I agree with him on more than I disagree.

Again, the man has $30M in the bank.  Doesn't seem like he's begging for anything.  
Stockman's busy schedule?  He ran for Senate and literally could not be found for a 30 day period.  He then got smoked in the primary (rolled up, lit on fire and inhaled--smoked).  He isn't running for reelection to his congressional seat.  His schedule wasn't that busy in January, and certainly isn't that busy now.  He is seen by many--including his own party--as a nut job.  
So, let's weigh the impact of a nut job former Congressman's support versus the current Attorney General/next Governor of the most business friendly state in the country...  You've made your choice, but I think most who are presented with these two options for helping spread bitcoin would go a different direction.

Thanks redditors, appreciate the info and help!  To the two down votes, go fuck yourselves!

Your donation, perhaps. Your post typifies the problem we have in the bitcoin community. We have a circular firing squad discussion about who is worthy of bitcoin and then turn around and complain that it isnt getting mass adoption or seen as legitimate. We finally get someone who is, for all intents and purposes, part of the establishment starting to accept bitcoin and instead of embracing it, we snipe at him and say he hasnt said enough about why he likes it. He didnt just put up the merchant app and accept it, he wrote a press release about why he likes it and why he is accepting it. That's good enough for me. I dont recall having to take an oath or make a pledge when I bought or traded my first bitcoin.  You and your logic is what is holding us back from mass adoption and expanding the user base. Get the fuck out of our way.

From what I can tell, after doing some digging, he's held public office for 12 years as Attorney General and has seemed to have done right by Texas in going after deadbeat parents, child predators, etc. If you're just straight up opposed because of his party affiliation, then that's a whole separate issue. But comparing him to the vast majority of politicians from both sides of the aisle, he appears to be one of the better ones out there.

This is fantastic!  Good for Greg Abbott.  This is the kind of exposure we need to foster wider user adoption.  Happy to donate some BTC!

Take 2 seconds a do a google search. He released a statement on why he is accepting. It was picked up by the AP among others. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 00:44:51
I did.  And I respectfully disagree with you. Net benefit that he accepts btc. Win win.
