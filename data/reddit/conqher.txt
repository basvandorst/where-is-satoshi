Long Explanation: Is not so simple, for be a real *"new-era currency"* you need to have a real value (beside your market price), the real value of bitcoin was the implementation of blockchain as an accounting system, after that only ETH and XMR have made real contributions (Smart Contracts and Privacy ).
Being the copy of another project does not add real value (even when they say "Improve" to that project like BCH) because people just don't find them useful, but XMR and ETH are really doing great things on their sides.
That said, cryptocurrencies (ALL) are experiencing a speculative bubble (like ".com" and the crisis of 2008 ), that has not yet reached its climax and will someday explode, that will make the useless projects disappear with the c~~r~~ash and the useful ones like Bitcoin (and the ones that I mentioned) will survive under a logical and normal price (that is, less inflated by indiscriminate accumulation/distribution processes).
In short: Yes, is there life after bitcoin, If you believe in Bitcoin, you believe in innovation and it is stupid to believe that this is the last step. But also yes, most of current projects are "*"scam's"".*

In reply to my own comment: The implementation variable (the ability of buy actives with BTC and Cryptocurrencies) is something to thing, because a lot of people are doing big investment in cryptocurrencies (billions of dollars) and someday the would need to take profit from these investments. What happens if in place of "Take profit" trading their BTC for FIAT in a few years they can use that for buy things?, i think it would be something new in the history.

That's the point, we don't have a new facebook because will be something like "Facebook Cash" but we have Twitter (ETH) or Reddit (XMR).
