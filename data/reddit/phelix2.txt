Hi thanks for coming here.
I don't have a problem with the browser part, my browser is irreleavnt. To replicate this issue, it should be enough to install Electrum wallet, Tor and set up Electrum to connect through Tor (though I'm sure that plenty non-tor configurations will be affected by the same crap, basically any IP that's seen as 'suspicious' by Cloudflare).
I'll appreciate a speedy resolution. if anything you could restore 'legacy' address payments for the near future.

I see the point. Still, IMO the way its implemented is a horrible idea - pulling a HTTPS resource through the wallet, that sounds like an accident waiting to happen. All you need is a 0day in the http parser of the wallet and boom - a malicious payment request can steal the contents of your entire wallet. Almost as risky as building a whole web browser into your wallet (or a wallet into your web browser) - you're actually increasing your attack surface. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:23:50
Yes, any wallet that stores the keys / seed for you like Electrum should be fine.

I do not know the answer, regardless, I would not trust Mycelium because they pushed Ads into their software which is a big no no for security critical apps. Imagine someone finding an exploit that would allow a malicious ad to steal everyone's coins.

Ouch, I feel you. Well, I think the lesson here isn't to always keep all your coins in storage, hardly anyone does that - but if you do invest your coins on something never ever go all in on one investment no matter how good it seems.

Mining is always most profitable with cheap electricity which is the case in China.
Instead of mining bitcoin, mining altcoins with GPUs could be a better idea because you're more flexible to switch between coins as their profitability fluctuates.
That said I rather recommend investing in bitcoins than buying a bunch of mining gear that may or may not pay off.

Hey guys! Figured to post my article to Reddit as well for your information and advice. 2fa/passwords sorta goes without saying these days, but some of the other topics should be worth a read even for the more experienced users. Let me know if you have any questions and stay safe out there!
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:57:24
Most wallets generate a set of addresses from the same seed words, and you can receive at any one of these addresses. To increase your privacy, i.e. make it more difficult for someone to guess how many bitcoins you have, it is recommended to change to a new address after each transaction, and this is again what most wallets do.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:06:34
Yes, 'Bitcoin Android Wallet' does store the private keys (or the seed words more specifically). Their process to derive keys from the seed words is different from other wallets like Electrum so you can't do a straight import. There is a guide [here]( how to retrieve the keys from a Bitcoin Android Wallet backup. It worked for me, let me know if works for you too.

Regardless of how inconvenient it may be for Kraken to retrieve things, this is still unacceptable for the customer. Mistakes happen. The exchanges really need to figure out a scalable way to handle these in the future. It can't be *that* difficult to do an automated refund procedure (to a given refund address the customer can put in his account settings).
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:52:24
Use XMR and forget about coin control ;)
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:31:47
Yes, that works. Conversely to what people think, Smartphones are actually a little more secure than desktops because of application sandboxing - a rouge app can't access your Bitcoins unless there are additional vulnerabilities. Just don't use a rooted phone.
That said, if you only want offline storage you might as well skip the phone, just print a paper wallet or use a USB drive.
And yes, I definitely recommend taking your coins off Coinbase, plus have a backup of the private key you move them to.

Honestly, this question depends too much on the individual that I doubt any answer or recommendtion here is going to be useful.
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:05:28
Have you tried calling the CEO of Bitcoin to help you out? /s
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:34:38
There's no need for any services to provide bitcoin 'gift cards'. Just print a paper wallet and transfer some BTC to it.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:33:37
I know someone who works for a bank and has some restrictions in what they allowed to. Basically they could buy things but not allowed to sell until after X days of getting into the position.
Anyway this probably depends on where they live etc.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:24:12
Is Jim's Bitcoin the newest fork? Where do I claim it? /s
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:48:36
Nice! I probably still have some ETH in mining pools. I should really check...
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:25:28


It is safe. The private keys can be derived from the seed words.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:46:19
It is always a risk to go in manually and refund things, but they don't have to do that if they can do it automatically from the software side. Just like the software sweeps deposits into their internal wallets it could sweep 'incorrect' deposits into a different address that refunds can then be made from. Yes it is also a security risk to change their software but they only have to do that once so once it's audited and deemed secure they should be good.


It may not be a lot to you or to Kraken but it might be a lot of money to that user. What if it's their entire live savings?
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:55:30
It could go either way really. Some predict that Bitcoin weathering off forks (like it did with the BCH fork) will just make it stronger and dissuade others from trying to fork in the future.
If you're afraid of the fork but also worried about missing out, just buy in small increments over a longer period of time. You'll have some bitcoins at a reasonable price no matter what happened.
Make sure you take your Bitcoins off of Coinbase afterwards because if you don't control the private key, they're not really your coins. Also check my [security guide]( (may be intimidating but you don't need to do everything - just a few items of that list and you'll be more secure than most :) ). If in doubt print a paper wallet move your coins there and forget about them. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:55:09
I'm not too familiar with KeepKey but generally yes, having the seed words is enough to take your coins.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:36:31
When you create a new wallet in Electrum, there's an option to restore it from an existing seed.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:06:14
I appreciate you coming here, but man... sorry that is a piss poor answer.


[citation needed]
Obviously someone at Kraken, or your software, it doesn't matter, controls the private key to the address. If you don't have that key, it can't possibly be a deposit address.
I should mention that other exchanges, like Poloniex, do this correctly. They will either refund your coins or credit them regardless of which address you used. Please explain why you can't do that. At the moment, I'm not seeing any answer other than 'we're too lazy to do it'.


Now you're citing a bunch of random blog posts which are in no way apparent to a new user who started with your site after the fork.


Uh, that's not how this works. So I'm gonna put up a sign in my house saying I'm not liable for anything and then steal from whoever comes in my house? Good luck doing that.
By allowing trading of BCH on your platform, you accept responsibility in handling client funds and that, by common sense, extends to handling deposit errors between BTC&lt;-&gt;BCH addresses. If you can't handle that, you should not have listed BCH. What are you gonna do if someone sends a million BCH to the BTC address? Are they also out of luck?

... old news? Why is that article posted now I wonder? Smells like a fishy blog aggregation site.
Anyway... when using bitaddress, always download the HTML for offline use and verify the checksum against github.

Great post! I prefer XMR myself. We need to educate more people on the concept of fungibility.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:23:05
I would expect that from a certain level of wealth on, you're not going to care whether you spend from your earnings, your capital, BTC or fiat... if the spending is insignificant, then who cares?
