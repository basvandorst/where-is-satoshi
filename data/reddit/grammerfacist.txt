About the high risk transaction cancelation, this happened to me. I emailed them explaining that it was a legitimate purchase and they offered to reinstate the order for me at the same price I originally purchased at, and whitelisted me for future purchases. So before you get in a big frump, try contacting support, it takes about 12 hours, but they are surprisingly helpful.
About the cancelation of orders, I too was a bit dismayed about not being able to cancel my order, but I waited it out and it ended up being worth it.
I am in no way related to Coinbase, but I like the concept of having the money stay in my bank account until I actually receive my bitcoins. I don't like having to transfer money out of my bank into an exchange to stay there until I decide to buy. Coinbase also highlights one of the major flaws with the banks of today, the long delay in transaction times between direct deposits/transfers/etc. I also like the ability to instantly sell my BTC in case of a crash, and have it not be dependent on Mt. Gox lag. (This is unlikely because I plan on keeping my BTC for it's currency value and simply having my money not in banks.)
All of this being said, I have gotten dwolla authorized with the intent of using bitfloor as my exchange. I too, was fed up with the "out of bitcoins" message. I ended up being able to purchase all I wanted to today, though.

Also, I would appreciate some more information regarding exact specifications of the device, and some background knowledge about your credentials and previous experience.

Another issue: I would appreciate the ability to see and track my order(if I were to make one) on your website, but there doesn't seem to be any sort of account system or order management there at all.

I certainly understand where you're coming from. I think that coinbase is a good starting point for a lot of people, like it was for me. I also like the fact that I keep all of my money in my bank until it actually goes through. It's a bit of mental security for me. Having said that, I will be switching to an exchange, CampBX I think, now that I have been verified by dwolla and poking around various exchanges.

Even with quantum computers, they aren't magical machines that break just any encryption. Special algorithms are developed to take advantage of the quantum nature of the computers. The two most well known algorithms are Shor's and Grover's. Shor's is very effective at factoring out prime numbers from encryption types like RSA. Grover's algorithm is much slower(comparatively), but it would be the one applied to SHA-256. Grover's algorithm effectively reduces the complexity of SHA-256 to SHA-128. So a doubling in key size would effectively prevent quantum computing from becoming feasible, and I would not be surprised to see a new alt-coin come out when quantum computers become scalable and available implementing SHA-512.

I bought 2 at 132 last friday. I was supposed to get them last night, but it was canceled because it was "high risk." I emailed them and within about 12 hours I got a response saying it was a mistake in their algorithm that they're still trying to optimize, and that I had been whitelisted for future purchases. They even offered to submit a new order for me at the same price I ordered at(which was still below the normal buy price at the time, during the decline).
Today around lunch, I managed to buy 2 more at about $140, and just now before it went up to $111, I bought 2 more at $98.
They have minimal fees, and I actually like the fact that the money remains in my bank account until they actually send the coins; no money tied up in the exchange, it's all still liquid in my bank account.
As to the "We've exceeded normal buy limits for today," it is rolling. So just keep checking back to see if they have some. They normally have some during large market fluctuations like when Mt. Gox went down a few hours ago to "cool off the market." Just be patient and keep refreshing/trying.

Well in your picture the price clearly says $999.00 which would make .001 BTC worth $0.999.

What a great business model! This is really innovative and interesting, kudos to you OP for having the initiative. In any game there should be a net kills to deaths of 0.

I'm viewing BTC sort of like any stock. Instead of my money just sitting in my bank account earning next to nothing in interest, I may as well invest it. BTC is almost guaranteed to go up as the difficulty increases and coin minting slows, so it's a good bet for investment.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:57:07
Yeah, they're still working on their algorithm for detecting high risk and fraud. I did the same thing, and i'm now whitelisted for any future purchases.

Other than just seeing if they'd let you resell gift cards... I'm not in charge of your business, but perhaps accepting 0% profit if they decide they don't want to sell to you in bulk? Or even selling the gift cards for a small markup. I'm sure it would be huge for the community and it'd get a big respected brand at least roughly associated with bitcoin.

After this whole fiasco with Mt. Gox and how much lag they have had, BTC-E's sketchyness and general bad reviews from others(although for coin to coin transactions i've heard they're ok), and bitcoin24's issues with their admin, I narrowed it down to either bitfloor or CampBx for my exchange needs.

SatoshiDice calculates a number based on the transaction hash of your bet. If that bet is lower than whatever number the address you send to requires, you win; if not, you lose. If you look at the bets, it says like "lessthan 32000." You aren't betting with or against anyone else, only the house.

I agree, but it could be sort of like [Bitcoinstore]( where it keeps track of the exchange rate, and dynamically adjusts the cost in btc. I think it could even have a good effect on the volatility, drive it down a bit as more people spend it like currency instead of trading it like stocks.

From what I understand from his video, and what I've been unable to find online regarding new cases, the single will be in the same case, it will just be multiple singles to match the same hashing power. It would essentially be the same power usage and hash rate, just more space being taken up. I'm ok with this since if they redesigned the cases, it would just be more delays to actually shipping them out.
