A bit like Season 4 of Lost?
I genuinely love the passion here but the response serves to illustrate the gulf that exists between the bitcoin community and the great unwashed looking for information on a currency that bypasses banks and borders.

I want to say that it does because I appreciate the response, but it just throws up further questions. From your responses I can ascertain that there is some infighting between the supporters of bitcoin and there seems to be a bug.
If I set aside an hour I'm sure I could make sense of it all but my point is that in a world where bitcoin would benefit from wider adoption, the language and topics of conversation here would alienate all but someone with a) spare time, b) an understanding of algorithms, c) a love of acronyms.

I understand most of what you're saying. My takeout is that bitcoin still has several key issues to resolve and there's a chance that another currency will resolve them first. 
If a goal of this sub is to build up support and understanding of bitcoin then I think it's failing. It's like turning up for a party when most people are drunk, half are arguing and someone's been sick in the swimming pool.

It depends what the goals of this sub are. I assumed, and heard, that it was to help it become more widely adopted.

I'm surprised anyone doesn't understand why having a Gone Wild link in the sidebar is a bad idea.

Ok. And let me be positive for a moment. There's clearly a lot of passion and interesting topics here. So if someone wants to engage, there's a lot to engage with. The question is how to bridge the gap between relative newbies such as myself and the people here who are into the minutiae of the technology and politics. 
Some of your ideas would certainly help.

Maybe I should be in another sub. That's a fair response. If so, then it might be a good idea to direct people to a more suitable sub. 
In truth I don't know how useful the sidebar is. I expect most visitors are mobile and CSS goes out on the window. Maybe update and update the FAQ sticky? I read the existing one, didn't learn much new, and yet could only understand one post in five.

Bitcoin is attempting to become more widely adopted and taken seriously as a currency. Having a link to barely-relevant naked pictures of women is at odds with those goals.

It depends what you want to achieve. The topics, while interesting to those with a good understanding, make bitcoin seem like an unsafe investment fraught with uncertainty. I feel less assured about bitcoin as a currency as I did before coming here. Is that an accurate concern or is it as a result of the tone of a this sub?
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:59:19
I agree with this completely. I don't want to break up the party but perhaps it could continue next door in another sub?
There are some really cool newbie-friendly things happening to bitcoin. It's being picked up in Japan; I can use a cool BlockChain app on my phone, I can buy and sell bitcoins far more easily than I could a year ago. And (not least) bitcoin is increasing in value at a rate that would put any investor to shame.
