Thanks for wishing me luck. I could use some ;-) And may you have a persistently happy holiday season!

We have put more info up on our site but essentially players of The High Life are MMJ growers. You try to fill up your grow room and whoever fills their grow room with the highest plants with buds wins. There are obstacles like being raided, critters get into your garden or that guy that never has any weed comes buy and smokes your bud. There are equipment cards and good karma cards. Dice are used to put equipment in certain places or to save your crop. It has sort of a craps feel because often times you are calling out the number you want to roll. It's a very karma driven game in that nobody really harms each other, that comes from the Life deck. If you help someone you are rewarded from the karma pile. It's really a lot of fun and a good way to socialize. We even attempt to educate a bit about MMJ and that it's not this evil that everyone thought it was. I hope you will give it a try!

Yes, we would certainly honor that price today! We checked on shipping and it would be $24. Maybe you could order a few and sell them to some of your friends to defray that cost ;-)

I understand.

No, this isn't Justin. I worked with him and am now in debt because of it. I blame him but I also blame Chase because they froze all of our assets. Check out the game, it is a lot of fun to play and I sure could use some revenue.

I bet you were the class tattle tale too? Keep up the good work.

Well, from what I've heard Chase seized all of their assets and shut down all of their credit cards. So everything I invested disappeared. I've been told I will get the money back some day but.....
