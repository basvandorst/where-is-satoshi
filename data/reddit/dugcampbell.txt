Cheers. Indeed the trams are now on the go. Positively flying around the streets now (ahem). Next step: getting them to accept BTC.... ;-)

Interesting - didn't see that myself. Can you remember who it was that brought it up? I'm the organiser of the Scottish Bitcoin Conference, like to keep an eye on what the press are doing in case someone's actively looking into the issue.

Always great to hear him in full flow.

This is big news!! And, to be honest, looks like it's come out of the blue. I organise the only (AFAIK) Bitcoin Meetup in Scotland and I heard nothing about this until the Coindesk article went live. It's a fairly well-known retail brand for those of you outside the UK.

Just used this for the first time today. Really simple and despite the guy at the newsagents not having a clue about what I was talking about (he'd never heard of Bitcoin in his life), it was smooth and painless. Definitely a great option for cash purchases based on that experience, will be using it again.

Agreed - a great conference in a cool location. And they even got the weather just right ;-)

Because he's failing in his role of providing strategic oversight for the business in his job as CEO if he doesn't understand it. There's no way that knows as little as he claims. Zero chance.
