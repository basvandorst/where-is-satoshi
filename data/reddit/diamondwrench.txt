Thank you thank you thank you. The voice of reason.

That's a pretty killer deal compared to most of the other hardware wallets. I hope it takes off.

Me, too.
Gonna buy from Overstock TODAY just 'cause it's gonna feel so damn good.

Hope he looks for a real job this time around! Sounds like a potentially smart chap, would be nice to have him around.

Can't happen soon enough.

Huh. Thanks!

The authors of the two articles define "job" completely differently, hence the difference of conclusion.

Looks like PureVPN changed their minds after seeing this video. Most triumphant.
