I read that as a positive.  He's saying there's risk to moving first into bitcoin.  But the first big boy to do so will cause a landslide and everybody will need to get in to survive.

much in the same manner you propose - just leaving out the sha256sum step.
1. bitaddress.org - insert them in the "wallet details" tab
2. bitcoinpaperwallet.com - insert them in the "validate" tab
3. use the github bash tool dice2key.sh to generate the key.  Then convert to bitcoin public key with using newBitcoinKey in bitcoin.sh github bash tool.
then compare all three to ensure no funny business.

ok, how about this:
You need cash.  Gotta find an ATM.  Let's see, check the map....none very close, guess I gotta drive over there. 
Oh, here's one real close, but it's not my bank.  Oh, they charge $5 to withdraw money and my bank will charge another couple bucks.   well that sucks.  And I still need to hike or drive over there...
With bitcoin and a setup like Coinbase, open your app, buy bitcoin instantly and you're ready to go!  You didn't even have to get up!

sure, its the list of die rolls you created  (my_dice_rolls)
99 rolls.  B6 means base 6, so the only characters are 0,1,2,3,4, and 5.
thanks for the link.  Like it says, to generate the private key, we are just generating a # between 0 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337
which can be represented by 32 bytes (256 bits).  
sha256sum outputs a 256 bit hash of the input.  I don't understand how it does that exactly, but it can take any input, not just your dice rolls.  Given that, if you limit the input to only the values 0,1,2,3,4,5 then I wonder if the resulting hash is always within a subspace of all possible values.
The dice rolls are purely random and equally probable in the entire 32 byte space.  So it feels more secure to me to use the die rolls to directly convert to the private key.  
The bash scripts from that link look interesting and would be a good cross check against the results from the paper wallet html to reduce the chance of hacking....

Yours and moral_agent's method takes a sha256 hash and gives that to a couple paper wallet generators to convert to bitcoin key pairs to verify no hacks.
The same can be done by taking the die rolls as a 99 character B6 value (instead of the sha256 hash) and feeding that to the same generators to ensure the same result. 
So I'd expect this to be just as "hack" proof.
What I'm really driving at is getting the maximum entropy from the inputs.   It kind of nags at me that the sha256 hash might be a subspace due to the limited B6 input.  While maybe the 99 character B6 conversion to bitcoin key pair covers the full space.  See my concern?
I hesitate to trust moral_agent's explanation that the entropy is sufficient....

I'm no expert on cryptography, but I wonder if the use of sha256sum with B6 input limits the space of the hash result.
If the input given to sha256 were the same number of characters (99) but were any characters, not just limited to 0,1,2,3,4, and 5, wouldn't there be more entropy?
The paper wallet sites let you enter the 99 digit B6 value and they directly convert to the bitcoin key pair.  (I think;  I haven't read the code)  
It doesn't appear that they run sha256 on it.  Could doing this be more secure than generating the sha256 sum on the dice rolls and submitting that result as a brain wallet passphrase?
