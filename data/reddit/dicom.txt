if it's not a lot of money to you probably better to just hold it in the exchange tbh. 
There's been a few major exchange hacks but way more people have lost their keys themselves.
So who do you trust more?  Yourself or a 3rd party?

Card looks great!!

Not wrong, not right.
You might lose out on significantly more profit if you decide to hold for another year or so - but you could also lose out by not selling.
Personally I think it's going to continue to rise.
If I had any debt to pay off, I would pull out now - but I don't.  IMO better to ride this roller coaster than to get off now.  Losing a bit of money now would hurt a lot less than missing an opportunity of a lifetime.

getting pretty hard to do small transfers with the fee's the price they are..

It's like this every day man. The price in unpredictable.  The only advice anyone to give you is don't panic and only invest what you can afford to lose.

You should donate yourself a Lambo if you haven't already.
If you can donate to a Canadian Charity I would suggest:
They really do a lot for kids diagnosed with terminal illnesses.

Because last week they were willing to play 19K  and this week they are only willing to pay 12K.
Herd mentality, sheeple etc.  Last weeks news was all how bitcoin is going to be worth $XXXXXX dollars in the future and everyone wanted to get in before it was too late.
This week the news is all FUD, "Charlie Lee" jumped ship, "Insider trading" etc.
Welcome to Bitcoin - 90% of the people here are trying to get rich quick.  We go through dips like this literally every two months. the only question is how long is this one going to last?  a few days like most or will we see another 18 month bear market?

IPv6 which still is hardly used years and years later
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:21:00


Any type of "optional" upgrade in the tech space will always be put off forever.  Look at IPv6.  It was supposed to be the backbone of everything in 2010, most companies haven't implemented any ipv6 support because ipv4 is good enough

Obviously that is true.  I am just telling you how the world works.

selling bcash, bgold ang bgod?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:04:25
It will pop, at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:54:33
Could definitely happen.  A small percentage of people own most of the bitcoin in the world. They could buy the shorts then dump everything.
I don't see it actually happening though.

Should probably remove advertisements on the site until you get more popular

way easier for an everyday person to walk into a bank and have the teller set you up a bank account.
