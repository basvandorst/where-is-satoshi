Yeah but if don't care about the time it take, you don't pay more than 300 sat/b
300 was the minumum in this wallet, it cause the high fee for thoose who want fast tx, that put a cap at 300sat/b and you must put more for fast tx
When i wrote this the 120+sat/b was mined
So if you made a 150sat/b it was good but the wallet told me mini 300sat
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:26:46
yeah they need some $$$ to pay their extradition :D
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:49:36
bitcoin dot com wallet have a tiny fee of 300 sat/b... Go donwvote this crappy wallet, is still 5 star on google apps
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:23:40
again the minimum fee are 350sat/b 
normal is 450 fast is 770
They overtaxe user for slow transaction...
on bitcoinfees.earn.com it's 110+ for 2-4 block and 290+ to be confirmed
with the "tiny" fees you will be confirmed next block...
it's a scam

@_date: 2018-01-23 12:35:54
you speak about "blind stupid people", but in fact you are too, how can you know how the market will go ? you don't know...
how can you be sure that CME affect the market ? 17dec was the last ATH, where people (stupid blind) buy btc more than 15k$ and was charged with horrible fees, the fee's complain here was called "Roger FUD", we only say "wait LN" they wait wait but they loose lot of money so they sell to not loose anymore
what can bring bitcoin to 20k ? only sellers... if you want to someone buy at this price, there must be a sellers at this price
but when they are more seller than buyer, the market go down
if you don't see there was a bubble rush "to get rich", YOU ARE BLIND
if you think theese people (stupid blind like you said) will come again, you're STUPID
I don't say that bitcoin is dead, i say the market is unpredictible and irrational

in my mind bitcoin for crypto currencies is like gold for fiat
gold is standard to convert fiat money, not everybody own gold (and you right asia have a stroke on cryptocurrencies)
bitcoin is like gold a standard for the crypto
then you can make a local cryptocurrencies sclaed on bitcoin or other worth

From what i read when you close a channel it is write in blockchain, what if steam for example open a channel and the input are more than 1MB ?
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:23:16
they can't do anything as long as we stay in UE rules (ironic for a frexit supporter :D )
UE's laws prohibe the capital mouvement restriction (No ban will be possible)
The only thing they can do, it's taxing
I am french, if i my gain (+ annual salary) are more than 100k€*, the taxe will be 60% of my gain
*it's an exemple because it's more complicate to calculate (donnation, reduction,...) but the 60% cap can be reached
their only objective it's tracking bitcoin gain and taxe it, but French minister of economy speak about bring down the tax to 30%, so no worry for UE and french bitcoinners
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:09:53
it matter that if more than 2000tx do this, and you want to move your bitcoin fast, you have to pay more than him to be sure
If a rich guys (or minner or scammer) want you to overpay the tx they just have to send 2000tx with 1000sat/b every 5 min
in this case if you want to be confirmed you have to pay more than 1000sat/b
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:11:30

@_date: 2018-01-19 21:51:56
I am french, you misunderstood what they want to do
in french law, bitcoin gain are severely taxed it can be 60%
first they annouced that they want to bring bitcoin in taxe cap called "flat taxe" no more than 30%
they want to protect bitcoiners against scam like bitconnect and themself agaisnt taxe fraud, the french market regulator is inspecting all trading site, in order to restrict acces to the site where there are no Id verification and can be used by taxe's frauders or drug dealers to "wash the money" and the site where they guarantee gains (scam in french law)

1 lot of people don't care about bitcoin and some of them are anti electonic money (for bank too)
2 if they don't care about bitcoin, LN will do nothing on them
3 most of people here invest to earn money, not for techinical support, as long as it's about price and not loose money, they don't come in a regulated market that can collapse in 1 hour
4 with big player it's all about "earn money" cf 3
In my mind bitcoin will continue to growth but not as excpect, perhaps we have already hit the moon
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:14:53
Media have a strong strength of suggestion
They reapeat bitcoin bullshit, then people think they have made their own conclusion
People look at ask/bid chart to conclude that's a scam money, they can't give one thing about how bitcoin work (nor fiat system)
They don't understand that they call "scam" is the Offer and demand market
And they continue to buy a 100$ iphone at a price of 1000$...

I said it some times ago
On coinbase, due to withdraw limit i discover that you can withdraw small amount of btc for free and it may cause spam in mempool
limit is 0,6btc (10000€) per day, but the limit decrease each time you refresh on the same day
otherwise to withdraw all my btc, i have to made multiple transaction of 0,6btc
i told them to give me a withdraw limit of 50000€ per day two weeks ago and i am still waiting an anwser

Green = ask

a red wall at 20k$ mean some people sell their bitcoin at 20k$, higher is the wall more there are bitcoin (you can read the number on chart : actually 2k6 bitcoin)
but in this wall there are all the bitcoin sell cheaper (like 19500$)
If somone buy 3000 bitcoin at market price (dont make an order at a specifique price) the wall will fall

Bitcoin is not a ponzi, trading and change the worth make it look like a ponzi

first the bitcoin never went away (only the value who was get up too fast because newcomers like me buy at market price and make it growth to fast and create the "crash")
2nd if there is a new bull run "to get rich" it will be bad for bitcoin, the 2 major things that nocoinner tell me are energy comsuption and volatility
if the price growth to fast, it can go down too as fast
In my mind bitcoin must growth in a normal way (0-5% per month) to be viable and trusted, not 50% in 2 day like in december, yeah it was cool to saw lot of money in my wallet, but it scare the nocoiner "Tulipmania" and it give to the FUD the argument "It will crash soon don't go in"

it's look like more the 2011 crash (in month) than the end of 2013 (in year) and could bounce faster than 2011 because, bitcoin have more visibility in media and internet than in 2011 !
it's my own point of view
we should have a crash after 10k$, and we have it before 20k$, 10k to 19k was a bonus for the long time hodlers !
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:00:53
this is what HODL mean, we are not pro day trader, hodl no matter what happens, sell only if you need fiat money, if you greedy sell you will miss some bounce and drive your average price of enter higher and higher
Make a simple plan (like sell at X2 or X3) and stick to it

i don't think the bitcoin can be tracked like money
if there is only 1 input to 1 output you can, but if there are more than 1 input/output, it will be really harder to track it from the 1st adress

@_date: 2018-02-07 17:17:10
your commentary really stunned me
you are a slave for the banks, they live with the money you make at work (and can take some if they failed) whereas you can be your own bank
And you ask me "what happen to the slaves if there are no slavery anymore ?"
Your answer is unemployment
My answer is freedom

bitcoin will rise in a crisis time and we are near, the greek crisis was a premiss of the UE crisis
Remember that greek people was limited to withdraw some money from their bank account, Now the UE added a new law that allow bankster to to take some money on your account...
i am just here for that, to prevent my bank to stole some money on my account, and have a value out of bank in case of crisis
I think about gold first, but bitcoin convince me that it can be used as a currency more easily than gold in case of an anti bank run law like in greec

he bought 1BTC 19k 
he sold 1BTC 6K
If he buy at 8K he have 0,75BTC
to recover his initial capital BTC must go to 25 333$ (0,75 x 25 333 = 19 000)

i told it several times...
I take the 14 days tx and make a average of tx fees
Since 14 days the mempool was emptied, but because people pay 200+, the average is still 200+
i just have a look, and it's only begin to decrease on this site it's now 170+, 2 weeks after the all 100+ tx will be confirmed...

The FUD is they give to Théry the régulation of bitcoin
like he was on internet in 1994
théry told in 1994 : "internet can't provide commercial service, can't provide sound and image fast, it does not constitute a worldwide global network in a futur"

people short it... they sell 1btc at 19k rebuy at 10k 1.5BTC resell at 13k rebuy at 9 k resell at 10k....... at the end they have more BTC
even by losing value of $ , you win some BTC, like selling at 19k buying at 15k selling at 13k buying at 11k selling at 9k buying at 7k5
