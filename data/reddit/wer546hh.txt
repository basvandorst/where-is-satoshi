Yeah...No. No, that's not at all what is happening. 
* It is not the inefficiency of cash that has caused this, but the strong control over the economy and public opinion that the banks have, that combined with an inherently high trust in public institutions, very strongly regulated economy, and an unusually low public tolerance for tax evasion. So, small business owners are strongly incentivized *by banks* to get rid of cash in favor of bank solutions, and at the same time strongly incentivized *by government* to get rid of cash by adding costs for cash handling. Once card and swish (see below) usage has reached a critical point where most customers use it anyway, it will be much cheaper for a small business owner to only accept cards/swish and get rid of cash handling (not accepting it) altogether.
* swish is an app that makes instant payments from bank account to bank account possible. It is developed and controlled by the 5 largest banks and has been extremely successful in replacing cash for payments where credit cards for whatever reason is impractical,such as individual-to-individual. There are no fees (yet) and the banks have pushed this app because it gives them control over the cash flows, and since it is owned by the oligopoly of big banks, it keeps new entrants out. The government, of course, is pleased to see cash replaced with swish, because it improves control for tax, AML, etc.
* Credit card fees (for business owners) are much lower than in for example the US, due to EU regulations. This means (again) that there is no incentive to not stick to credit card payments and get rid of cash.
* For all the above reasons, there is no market space for bitcoin when it comes to payments. Swish dominates the app based payments between individuals and very small businesses, and credit cards for larger transactions with most businesses. Bitcoin cannot compete with swish because swish is subsidized by the banks, and backed by the full marketing and PR force of the banks, plus the government. It cannot compete with credit cards for non-digital payments either (in physical stores).
* Bitcoin's niche and best opportunity has always been and is certainly in a country such as Sweden, online transactions where it at least is more practical, or not less so, than credit card payments and swish. Unfortunately, many bitcoin advocates, are still hung up on this idiotic notion that in order to succeed, bitcoin must focus on  becoming a means for "buying coffee". That could be the last phase of bitcoin success, but it can never be a leading indicator.
* Sweden has a much lower adoption of bitcoin than most other Western countries, partly because cash use is already so low and the non-cash alternatives are fairly competitive. Also, like I mentioned, faith in government solutions is (still, if on it's way down) relatively high, privacy concerns very low (a result of never having been occupied by nazis nor communists, as opposed to most other countries in Europe), and this means that it is fairly easy for banks/government to convince most Swedes that bitcoin is just for criminals, and basically a threat to the Swedish welfare state.
If and when we'll see bitcoin succeed as a widely used payment system, I'd expect Sweden to be one of the last to follow suit, and only because other countries adopt it first. Sweden will not under any circumstances be a leader in bitcoin or crypto adoption, I assure you.
