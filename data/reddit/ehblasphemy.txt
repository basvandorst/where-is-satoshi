You wait for a ship that might not turn around
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:56:36
I’d be mad pissed if I missed this rally because of the wait time, I am in the us
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:47:11
I freakin bout little gains
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:18:22
Sounds sketch but a person I met on the inter webs told me to do it so I said fuck it I did
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:37:23
What bro
@_date: 2019-08-06 06:12:44
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:17:56
You deposit btc and they have pros trade for you
@_date: 2019-08-06 06:20:28
Add it to the list it’s a scam
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:50:52
Bitmex 10x leverage.
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:10:51
Coinbase has a 5% fee right? Any sites where I can buy for around the market price?
@_date: 2019-08-06 06:20:04
It’s a scam add it to the books fellas
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:32:45
I’m chilled. I smoked a blunt. You are right, I am pretty new to this space and alrdy trading with idiotic numbers. Not used to how quickly btc can drop thought it’d at least give me a chance to cash out when it starts dippin. I know better now
@_date: 2019-08-06 05:30:09
I alrdy kissed it goodbye. I’ll let you guys know if it’s a scam or not gonna take one for the team
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:08:02
Thank you bro! I am not worried I am sure the bulls will retest 14k
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:37:16
Cuz I thought it was going to break 13k over night.
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:03:50
U know anyone that wants a healthy kidney? For the low. Just give me 2 bitcoins fam price
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:44:52
I sold at 125 looking to buy in again in 6 days.. fucking Robinhood takes too long to withdraw money pls don’t shoot back up
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:22:57
Ty for responding bro, I’m selling at next peak. I’m new to this game I don’t want to be wiped out by shitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:03:17
I am.. I just want to sell a kidney that’s all
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:34:40
 I put in another long at 12400, we are on the road to recovery boys.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:52:24
Yes 100% keeps all the pussies out of the game
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:07:20
I’d take the latter, stupid for not taking profit at 86%.. did not think it could dump 2k in 30 minutes.
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:45:27
Any publicity is good publicity
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:55:52
I wanna see bitcoin drop to 2k so I can sell my kidney and buy in
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:59:12
You as well good squire
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:15:01
Why not? Correction coming on the 15th?
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:37:42
Naw I meant individually just a stoned idea I had that’s all
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:28:22
I sold on Robinhood so I can buy on coinbase
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:36:43
Oh shit rly? How much is it for Coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:01:59
I know I am being scammed but what can I do
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:15:15
I can’t afford it no but I can afford to lose what I can afford
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:16:15
When is that do you know?
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:16:58
Do you don’t think the parabolic rise recently is indicating a potential bull run?
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:19:01
Should I wait till after the 15th (binance update) to drop money into bitcoin?
