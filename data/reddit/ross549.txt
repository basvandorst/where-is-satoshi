Thank you for your thoughtful and reasoned response.

I'd call it a bit extreme. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:11:02
Heh. Good point. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:47:53
Do you conspiracy much?
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:16:16
This is moronic.

Go to a credit union.  :-)

Some of us have data caps too, and torrenting uses a LOT of bandwidth. I just do it at home where I am on a 100mbit connection.

Economics of scale. Selling 1 million iPhones, for example, is a completely different matter than selling 500 POS terminals.

Yes. Just jailbreak. Not that I want to, though.

A torrent app? Really? That's a thing?
"Wait a minute- I have good LTE here and I need to finish this GoT download."
Right. Sounds exactly like something I would do on a crappy cellular connection.

Tracking and reporting should be easy enough.

This looks cool.

So when Apple made the App Store guidelines, they focused on making sure Bitcoin would be excluded?
Right. That must be it.

And Apple has changed their policies over time. If you recall, apps were previously not allowed if they duplicated core functionality. 
Give Apple some feedback on this!

Instead of signing some silly petition, go to apple.com/feedback and put a suggestion in. They do read these.

Something to do with the panemteric fam, no doubt.
