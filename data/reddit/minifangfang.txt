prices go up when there is chargeback fraud... but regardless of that, there is no reason why both credit/debit cards and bitcoin can't coexist... there are benefits for person to person electronic transactions that don't rely on a 3rd party.

jesus!!! paypal is not a cash-like transaction. your money is controlled by paypal and it can be reversed!!!  same with CCs!!! I have personally had my funds held by paypal for 6 months. this cannot happen with bitcoin transaction just as it can't with cash!!! you have no idea what you are talking about!!!

you comparison to the car is specious at best. for something that has only existed for a few years, bitcoin is used widely. BTW, the car WAS invented BEFORE there were roads specially made for cars. They didn't go around building roads in anticipation of the invention of the automobile... the road for BTC, is the internet, and it already exists... you people are just impatient... the time will come as the btc economy grows...

not really my argument... I was just going with your analogy


anyway... I'll go with the "internet is the road for btc's car" is specious... mostly because it sound retarded

I am confused about the point you are trying to make. There have been roads good enough for cars for a very long time. no one ever said otherwise.

I think there's a bitcoin car... thought I saw one here a couple days ago.. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 06:59:06
luckily just about 40 bucks. so I am not too upset. glad I didn't try a larger order!

electronic cash-like transaction... how does anyone NOT understand this???
@_date: 2014-09-10 12:08:36
you are only talking about when buying from a merchant business... what about p2p transaction? am I supposed to just trust that you won't charge back???  you seem to miss the whole point. I am tired of trying to explain it to someone with an IQ in the double digits

What crash??? are we calling a couple % a crash now???

there have been paved and cobblestone roads for a very, very long time. somehow I doubt that if the car had been invented before NYC became large, people would not have understood the benefit. they would have just gone and built better roads... much as they did AFTER the invention of the car.

I just foolishly thought the site wasn't so flagrantly fraudulent as others here claimed to have used it successfully. At least it didn't cost me too much.

I posted in their subreddit as well and have not gotten any response from the guys who run the site...  pretty sure these guys are selective scammers... I'm sure this is where they are making their money. I always thought a 1% fee on such small volume didn't really make sense for that site. they are just taking entire orders for themselves.

as can payments to you... causing chargeback fraud and increasing prices for everyone... do I really need to spell this out for you???/

Mine was just stolen by purse.io... opened an account. placed an order. right after the order was shipped, purse closed my account and doesn't respond to emails. the items have already been delivered to the buyer and I have not gotten any btc or a response from purse as to why my account is frozen after 1 order.

while you are right about how most people view the currency, you need to put this in perspective. not long ago, the average person would have told you that he has no use for a computer at home, let alone in his pocket. forecasting future growth based on popular opinion is just about the most inaccurate thing you could ever do.

yup... sounds like my ex
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:13:19
jesus christ.. if you can't understand the benefits of a cash-like electronic payment system, then you are a fucking moron
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:42:10
how am I supposed to provide evidence, when I can't even access my account? They didn't even send an email to notify me or give a reason.
