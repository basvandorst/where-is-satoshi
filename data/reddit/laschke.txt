2 years ago it was $500. Let that sink in.

Of course it's possible, no need to get defensive. I just have a hard time agreeing that this is manipulation... We just went 10x over the course of a year. Big players who were buying at sub $1000 can sell at $8k and still make a (huge) profit. Retail investors pushed the price up on low volume in Nov/Dec to $20K and now a lot of the big institutional players who stocked up over the summer are taking profits... This is what happens in markets. When big stake holders take profits the price goes down. That isn't really manipulation...
People are losing their heads claiming conspiracy theories and spreading FUD about manipulation when in reality this is still a healthy correction in a volatile market. Now if the price drops below 2-3K, I would be more inclined to side with you on this. But we are still at levels we were a few months, which, in my eyes, does not show a sign of manipulation.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:42:27
? "manipulated" ... really?
You do realize the price quadrupled in the matter of a 3 months and went 10x over the course of a year right? Just because we are seeing a correction doesn't imply that there is manipulation going on...This is normal (and very healthy) price movement...

I saw your post in the other sub on r/bitcoinmining. Seriously there is a reason that almost nobody on this sub mines and is telling you not to waste your time... The energy required to do it just doesn't make it worth it. 
If it was as profitable as you think it is, we would all be doing it. Unless you somehow have access to extremely cheap/ free energy (which I highly doubt since you mention southern IL) it isn't a profitable venture. 5 years ago, yeah maybe. But today, not unless you have millions to invest and access to extremely cheap electricity.
The one way you could maybe (very unlikely though) do it in the U.S. is by investing hundreds of thousands of dollars into small mining shacks in the desert with solar installed. There is a guy who is doing it in the SW. Basically if you had hundreds of thousands to build extremely efficient units devoted to mining you may be able to make your money back years from now at which point you can start thinking about profit. This, of course, would require some serious knowledge to do it in a way where you even have a shot at it being profitable.

Yeah, but this is kind of comparing apples and oranges here. Like someone else in this thread stated, if you were to try to sell a large chunk of Apple stock, the price would also tank... Since bitcoin isn't really a company it is hard to make a fair comparison. Just using the basic concepts of supply and demand, of course if you try to sell $1B of any stock at once you'll probably tank the price of any entity's stock pretty bad
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:06:12
Buying on a monthly basis is a better protection against crashes. If you invest $1200 and the price drops to 1/2 overnight, you will only be left with $600 in value. That is unlikely, but possible. By investing monthly, you are averaging your investments: more protection against drops, less overall gain if it does go up.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:54:39
If China "banned" bitcoin, I think we would be in for a major crash.

I'm done with this sub tbh. I used to stop here multiple times a day to check news. But now there are so many morons just wishing to make a quick buck and who know nothing about blockchain technology.
It's not even that I care if you don't understand what a blockchain is. I didn't either when I first started investing small amounts. But I also didn't make shit comments when there were drops. I knew that I didn't understand how everything worked yet and by default didn't know how markets usually played out. So I didn't make shitposts when I lost money.
Anyway, I used to love the discussions on this sub. But now they've devolved to a status where you only find 10% of people who know SOME about how the markets function, and like 1% who actually can provide an informing, insightful comment... that isn't horseshit, you know they did their research and have experience.
I've found some better subs now. Anyway, thanks for everything real OGs. You all really helped me figure out what all this was about and helped me get to where I am today. I'll still lurk here and probably check a few times a week. You all were great mentors and I wish the best to you all.

There are some people around here that get a "holier than thou" attitude and feel that since they've been here for a while they are the only ones who deserve to be in it.
Don't sweat it. Newcomers like you are what is needed for mass adoption. Also, the more people that come in, the higher the demand and the higher the price. It takes a while to learn everything, we were all once in your shoes. Just keep trying to learn about the technology and keep up with the crypto current events/markets and you'll get there.
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:29:27
wow... this is one of those great posts that somehow brings you back to reality; it reminds you that it's not all about the price but more about the technology. It's easy to get in the mindset of using the markets as an indicator of how well Bitcoin will do... but, the technology is, and will continue to be, the indicator of success. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:59:32
No, just because someone is new to something and doesn't understand it all yet doesn't make them a fool.
 I'm not saying that people should dump their life savings if they have no idea what they are getting into. I'm saying that it's fine to be new and not understand everything yet... I was at that point when I first started, as was everyone else.
If you want bitcoin to stay where it's at and have no newcomers, great. You won't see any new merchants accepting it and the price will never top $10,000.
But for bitcoin to become globally adopted and recognized as currency by most merchants it needs new people coming into the market. I'm saying that we need to have new people coming in who may not completely understand it yet, they'll catch on. It's not ideal but it's a necessary growing pain.

Well, Litecoin was originally created to be a faster version of BTC used for smaller transactions. 
If we are being technical, Bitcoin SegWit came way after Litecoin SegWit. But, as I said, Litecoin was made to be faster than Bitcoin and to survive Bitcoin had to implement something like SegWit. I wouldn't really say it was "copying" but more implementing a solution that has proven itself by being used by other blockchain technologies.

Great thinking! You should also notify them that they should think about getting involved in politics. They could manipulate so many  things if they had inside deals and influenced politicians. They could even like influence policies that benefit themselves and make them more money. I can't believe they haven't considered this before; they have been missing out on so much!
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:34:15
ah understood. I suppose in a way I was saying that. If someone is willing to pay a higher price than I am, I'm not going to complain... It only increases the value of my current investment.

wow... this comment thread is a trainwreck. people making arguments against each other and both are completely wrong and neither has a clue on the topic they are discussing...
Bear markets still follow patterns and an educated/knowledgeable investor can still make money. obviously there are exceptions, but for the most part those who have done this enough can make money... That doesn't make them a genius and that doesn't mean that they just got lucky or are a whale.

I can't say for sure on that; you'll have to do the calculations yourself as the last time I did the prices were way different and wouldn't give you a decent idea now. 
These are helpful websites:
@_date: 2017-07-08 06:39:24
hmmm well if you have a decent rig, that's a no brainer. You aren't spending money to mine so literally anything you make is essentially a profit.
That being said... It does take quite a bit of electricity (your computer will constantly be pulling a lot more power in order to mine) soooo I'd check and make sure that the military base doesn't have an electricity cap or something. I'm not sure on what you can/can't do while living on a military base.
But yeah, if you don't have to pay electricity at all you could make a lot of money!

LTC actually has been touted as an alternative to BTC due to its quicker transactions and lower fees. Proponents argue that it is more feasible to use LTC than BTC on most transactions and that BTC should be used as a literal "gold" where only value is stored in it. I get what you are saying though, most cryptocoins are distinct.
Also you mention that the pipe dream mentality boosts the price, and yes you are right. But it also creates larger and more severe dips when the innexperienced market gets spooked. People who don't know what to expect in the market, see one small dip, get second thoughts about the life savings they just invested, and pull out while they haven't lost much, creating huge and frequent gouges. It's a two sided coin having new investors wanting to get rich quick. They boost the price but also make the market more volatile.

There was a post about this on r/btc earlier today. I think both sides have a lot more in common than they really think... An agreement needs to be made for everyone to survive. Otherwise everyone will go down. We are all on the same team and need to figure that out sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:02:02
lol. I understand your sentiment, and I thank you for trying to bring some positivity into this sub... But 3 months isn't very long to be invested in BTC. Not to mention the fact you sound like you really only are concerned with the price, not the potential of the technology. To anyone who has been here for a while, you really are still a newcomer that is concerned with only the price and doesn't understand the true value of cryptocurrencies.
In reality, you haven't been here long enough to really understand how bad things can get or really understand how the last year has been an extremely great year. For example, it's a very strong possibility another Mt. Gox situation will happen where the price plummets and takes years to recover due to a negative event. Right now, is a relatively uncertain time for the future of BTC with important deadlines looming that have the potential to change the entire future for BTC. Not to mention the crypto market has never been this competitive: other coins like ETH and LTC are showing potential, dozens of other up-and-coming coins may completely surpass anything we currently have. There is still the potential for government bans or regulations, another event that would scare a good chunk of investors, leading to more volatility and crashes. 
 Will the price continue going up? Recent trends indicate it is likely. At the same time, the price has doubled in the last few months... This a good indicator of bubble-like activity and there could be some pullback on the price over the next couple months.
Will people who bought in at highs make their money back by just holding? It's hard to say, an unforeseen event could cripple the market. It is possible they will make their money back if they hold long term (I'm talking 4+ years) but not a guarantee.
I guess I'm just saying please don't pump this sub full of unrealistic optimism, especially based on your extremely limited amount of experience. People need to understand that there are risks involved with investing. They can't just be told that as long as they hold, everything will be okay. If you understand the risks and how to play the game, you have the potential to make a lot of money. You can also be the most strategic investor and still lose everything you put in. But please do not, in the interest of not misleading those who do not fully understand cryptocurrency markets, tell people "you only lose money when you sell".

Haha doing some digging huh? This post was from months ago.
Anyway, depends on where. There's a reason most mining is located in China and that's because electricity​ is cheap there. If you are somewhere where electricity is around the same as the price in China, you may be able to. I don't have exact numbers on how cheap it would need to be but you could probably find them online. They are forums all over discussing it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:06:57
Well that site is a pretty good estimate.
I am no expert but 4 months sounds, very fast. I guess I don't know where you are from but if you have cheap electricity, it is possible that you would start making a ROI in 4 months. I'd do some more research first but IMO I'd say go for it, good luck! Wish I had cheap enough electricity to make my money back in 4 months!
