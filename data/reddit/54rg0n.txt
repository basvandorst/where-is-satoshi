Yes, security is ALWAYS a concern with any kind of online wallet, which includes your exchange wallet. It was proven over and over, one major exchange after another. Nobody thought MtGox could fall, until proven wrong. People who wanted to be ready to sell when panic hits, or thought that they can outsmart the market in active trading, lost everything in a blink. Your exchange must be in and out, no thinking. If you think about your investment too much too often, you emotions WILL take over, and you WILL fuck up.

100% agree with OP.
Read about dollar cost averaging. This shit seems insane, but it's a real investment mindhack. The less decision you leave to yourself, the less you think about your investment, the better. Ask Andreas, he uses this strategy. Do this:.  
1. Get a cold storage electrum seed.  
2. Get yourself master key for monitoring your wallet.
3. Buy bitcoin for X dollars every week, bitcoin price doesn't matter.   
4. Withdraw bitcoin regularly to your cold storage so you don't get MtGoxed, and you don't get tempted to panic sell it on price drops. You will NEVER outsmart the market.  
5. Watch your master key wallet and enjoy getting rich.
