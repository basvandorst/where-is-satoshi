it is live again
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:13:38
ok, then please elaborate..
btw. here is video of testflightapp process of beta testing new apps, from 3:00 you can see exactly the same setup as seen on promo video
again, if you really want to try this use only small bitcoin wallets

dumps are offline, can anyone upload the latest ones somewhere public?

reverse engineered? right, provisioning profile is just certificate encrypted by Apple and embedded with UUIDs of devices allowed to install beta versions of apps.
If this has to work, OP has to establish new $99 Developer program for every 200 devices that sign ups for this bitcoin app store. Action that won't go beyond Apple's notice.

iOS developer here, this "bitcoin app store" is using part of apple SDK for over-the-air distribution of apps to beta testers. 
It is the same as  - tool for distributing new builds to testers. Also check out their FAQ 
To install the bitcoin app store, they have to collect your UUID (device unique identifier) and add it to apple developer tester list. After that you have to install apple provisioning profile (it can be seen in the video) to be able to access the app builds. ALL OF THIS GOES THROUGH APPLE. This is definetely not long term sustainable. Also there is beta testers number cap enforced by Apple and as of iOS 7 it is just 200 devices per dev account.
Please don't be stupid and test this only with small ammount bitcoin wallets.

only with 'small' amounts of bitcoin

This is game theory. All miners are gravitating towards lesser risk and stable reward. Equilibrium is 100% of miners in one pool collecting payoffs according to their part in mining operation.

anyone? I am able to write the image scraper but I need the dumps. The sooner the better.
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:47:57
Was there, for sure give it a visit when being in Prague, they have serious coffee making equipment :)

Donate it to "douchebag companies" museum

article is about SpaceX bringing unrestricted internet everywhere. Obviously bitcoin can make use of that.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:32:15
TLDR; SpaceX started production of 4000 small, low orbit (therefore low latency) satellites. Satellites will provide high-speed internet anywhere on world. Access to internet will by paid, SpaceX is hoping to partially fund it's Mars missions from the proceeds.

Outcome would be interesting - Elon the ruler of Mars, Moon and Democratic Republic of China :D

If there is a way how Bitcoin can start serving unbanked people in developing countries, this is the way how to do it. Even in middle of desert with solar charging phones and small adapters. Also, this would be a salvation for people in countries with internet censorship like China.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:04:03
Hilarious how it indeed is relevant. Unrestricted internet access is requirement just to be able to use Bitcoin, something that is currently not possible everywhere.
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:47:03
I mean, the given cryptocurrencies very obviously picked to be able to look good with the stylish Apple gadget.
But I get your point.
@_date: 2015-04-27 18:45:30
Well, nobody is putting shit-tons of marketing money behind Bitcoin like Apple does for Apple Watch
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:38:52
the request feature is looking cool
