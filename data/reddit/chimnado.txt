This Bitfinex fiasco stinks to high heaven. If I was a betting man, I'd say Raphael Nicolle has made off with the 120K Bitcoin.

How do you know? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:42:59
Sounds like an inside job. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:39:51
I think this is one big co-ordinated scam. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:16:12
They asked? [You got arrested if you didn't!](  Good ol' Federal Reserve: stealing money right out your pocket from day one. I read about this the other day, and it made me so angry I had to stop myself from swearing at the Wikipedia page on my computer.
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:44:14
I suspect this is all a scam. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:59:18
I think you're right on the money with this one. There's something sketchy about this whole scenario. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 05:12:43
We win. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:11:59
Because it's digital gold. To the moon! 
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:15:48
I think they stole it. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 05:21:56
Found the realist. I agree :(
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:31:16
Well if said it wasn't an inside job, then it couldn't have been one. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:55:22
I suspect so. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 06:01:58
I feel the same.

I predict Bitfinex will be the next Gox.
Tether will be exposed as fractional reserve and there will be a run on the exchange.

Deflation. Things become cheaper in money terms. Your bitcoin appreciates in value: i.e. its buying power increases. [Deflation - Jörg Guido Hüllsmann](
Wealth is not ultimately measured in terms of money, it is measured in how much stuff that money can buy.

Don't waste their time. When btc is valuable enough, they'll be asking how to accept it.

Yes, but Bitcoin is fundamentally different in that it only a limited amount will ever be created. Fiat/paper money on the other hand is constantly being inflated/pyramided. During the 2008 financial crisis the Federal Reserve created trillions of new US dollars to buy government bonds from commercial banks. Trillions of dollars... The US only completely cut ties with gold in 1971 - so  it's really only been about 45 years. Really not trying to start an argument with you, I'm just fascinated with the subject. I've been listening to an audio book by Murray Rothbard on the Federal Reserve: [The Case Against The Fed ]( You can also get the [eBook version]( - both for free. Really interesting read.

It's definitely not a conspiracy theory. The modern financial system is based on debt and taxation - nothing more. The only thing backing your dollar/euro/renminbi is the goodwill of the respective central bank (Fed/ECB/PBC). These banks have the power to create money out of nothing.

That's so cool. Glad you guys can share a common interest. 
what are your thoughts on the current banking system and also on gold? Cheers.
