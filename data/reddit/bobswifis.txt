Thank you for this. I couldn't find an easy way to set one up in my past, half-hearted google searches. Thank you for presenting this on a silver platter.
I finally spun up an UNRAID VM and started my own node. This was ridiculously easy to set up (even while trying to feed and sleep a 1-year old). Now I plan on running a 24/7 node to help keep the network decentralized.
Also, the wallet feature is really cool.

Keeping it on Coinbase is like keeping your money in the bank, which negates a lot of the ideology behind Bitcoin. This includes freezing of funds and at the mercy of an institution's security measures. Granted, Coinbase is very safe and has a good track record, but nothing is unhackable.
If you put it in a paper/hardware/software wallet it's like keeping the cash on hand and under your own rules. Now, you have to be careful that YOU don't get hacked or are careless with your funds. You have control and responsibility over your funds. 
Also, Coinbase automaticaly charges high transaction fees when you want to pay for stuff. So if you use it as a "hot wallet" (active wallet), you're going to add $3 to every purchase. On wallets you control, you can set transaction fees to something more reasonable.

Follow the directions that TREZOR will put out shortly after the fork.  
After the August Bitcoin/Bcrash split, everyone got an equal number of BCC that they could sell for ~$600 a pop. S2X will similarly credit you an equal number of B2X that you hold at the time of the fork.

There are [many, many, many address combinations]( that can trace back to exchanges, hardware wallets, [paper wallets]( or brain wallets (aka think of a word, hash it, and you have an address).

If you keep your bitcoins on computer software, there's a huge chance remote hackers can hack and rob you.
If you keep your bitcoins on your phone, there's a good chance remote hackers can hack and rob you.
If you keep your bitcoins on an exchange, there's a small chance remote hackers can hack and rob you.
But if you keep your bitcoins on a hardware wallet like TREZOR, there's no chance remote hackers can hack and rob you. Someone has to actually push a physical button to send bitcoins anywhere. So keep it safe and your pin hidden.

You don't understand that this is revolutionary. It's as disruptive, or more disruptive, than the internet was in its time, or the motor car was in its time. Bitcoin is redefining money and how we pay for things.  
Bitcoin is more than just digital currency. We have digital currency today with direct deposit and plastic cards. Bitcoin is money outside of government control.  
I argue that Bitcoin is money because in the last 60 days, I have done the following: 
* Gotten paid a portion of my paycheck in bitcoin.
* Used that bitcoin to pay for gas.
* Used that bitcoin to pay for a Steam game. 
* Payed a co-worker in bitcoin for fixing my car.
* Donated bitcoin to a charity organization.
Saying Bitcoin is a commodity is as absurd as asking to get paid in chewing gum, or paying your bills in bananas. 
AND YES BITCOIN IS SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE! FUCK YA THAT MAKES ME HAPPY! It solves the double-spend problem that others could not overcome when making a money replacement. This is a better money system than we've ever had.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:40:25
As we get closer to the split date, more information will come out to keep yourself safe.  
For now, solid advice includes:  
* Hold all your bitcoins outside of exchanges, preferably on hardware wallets or paper wallets  
* Don't plan on spending or receiving bitcoins for a day or longer after the split. In the worst case situation, there will be a chain war before one chain is decided to be "the chain." If some sites use one chain and others use the other chain, coins WILL be lost because of lack of replay protection. Just hodl and wait.  
* Bitcoin is not "going away," independent of what happens or which chain wins. Keep reading and look for new publications as they come out.

Good idea. You've inspired me to get a couple cheap miners (probably a few USB ones) and start mining.

* They wont. Countries can't even agree to not be dicks to each other. Countries won't agree on monetary policy. Peer-2-peer BTC-to-USD conversions exist, even if they shut down exchanges. Bitcoin also stretches past boarders and is outside of government control. (That's controversial, but gov't would need to shut down the internet to stop bitcoin and they would be overthrown before they got close to that.) 
* Currently, it would be strained. We're not prepared for everyone, but we would get prepared very very quickly. Bitcoin adapts and overcomes challenge, but growing pains involved in mass adoption now would be much more painful than if we could properly prepare and have everyone using it in 5 yrs.
* It would become a legacy system for niche uses. Faxes, horse carriage, railway... all of these technologies have not disappeared. They have their uses. They are not primary methods of use in their respective realms of technology, but they are still around.

It's safe on Coinbase for now. You don't want to leave it there forever, but leaving it there for a week while you read up on different wallets will be fine.  
If you want to drop ~$100 on a hardware wallet, get a LEDGER NANO S or a TREZOR from Amazon or the manufacturer. These are one of the most secure options and make spending, receiving, and viewing balance very easy.  
Paper wallets (the other secure option) are free but are very difficult to spend from.  [Go here and start reading](
Phone wallets are fine too (like Bread wallet, mycellium, etc.). But if your phone is compromised then hackers can steal your bitcoin. If you have a separate, old phone maybe wipe it and install a wallet app on it? That should be pretty safe.

The 2X hardfork is demonstrably a gov't/corporate takeover of this new technology.  
It's comparative to the telcom companies going in for the net neutrality kill in 1992-3 when the internet was still a baby, only with much worse implications. 
Bitcoin is meant to be free, open, and without borders. If the 2X fork succeeds, that will no longer be the case.
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:46:26
Short Answer: No  
Long Answer: Each transaction is generated using a private key, then validated by the nodes. These valid transactions are included in a block with is also hashed using a hard-to-find number (nuance, through mining) and the previous block hash so that the resulting fingerprint starts with a certain number of Zeros at the beginning. If even a single character is changed in a transaction or block, the resulting block fingerprint changes completely and needs to be re-mined.
So by extrapolation if a forked chain diverges from the main chain by a single block, it will be rejected as invalid because the fingerprints don't match. There's no way for blocks to be combined (in either larger blocks or in a zipper fashion) because the blocks would not hold the previous block fingerprint AND all transactions AND a fingerprint with the appropriate amount of zeros.  
The whole chain would need to be re-mined from the point of the split if you wanted to merge.

Related - How did Bcrash trade before it existed too? I assume the two answers will be related.

".1 BTC" would become the new "1 BTC"

This. Or a brand new MarsCoin based on the Etherium or something. Decentralized Mars voting, asset management.
Do society over, the right way.

Core 0.15 will ban them as soon as they transmit an invalid block, ~~but you wont be able to immediately tell who they are by the peer agent string (so you can't ban them ahead of time or with logic).~~ Doing this could have political consequences. Think before you act (but it's also your node so do whatever the hell you want). 
Wolf in sheep's clothing.

There are many. Mycellium is accepted as a decent wallet.  
I was trying to get you up and running quickly so I could give you some :)

Oh oh oh, something interesting that you might include is HOW unhackable it is. 
Poll the room and ask them if they've read about some place (Store, bank, etc) getting hacked recently or someone in the news for corruption. 
Bitcoin is based on math and cryptography. You don't have to go into the technical details of the whitepaper, but explain it would take more technology that we currently have and longer than the heat death of the universe for someone to successfully hack bitcoin. You also can't tempt or corrupt "math" because it doesn't have feelings.
Where would they rather store their hard-earned life savings?

The hardware wallet uses a standard (BIP 39) method of generating keys, so it will tell you to write down the 24 word seed and keep it safe.
You can use those 24 words in any supported (BIP 39) wallet - hardware or software.
You could theoretically generate the keys and write down the words, transfer bitcoin to the address that it gives you, then wipe the device. If you ever need to access the keys just use the same hardware wallet or buy a new one, and recover it with the saved words.

This is what I did. I emailed Bitpay and Coinbase. Hopefully Coinbase's response is a bit more professional.

Where does the 10 LTC come from? How is the recipient richer? 
Where did the .1 BTC go? Is it locked up for future atomic swaps?

I imagine it will be similar to how the internet and fax co-exist.

Not a problem, glad I could help. I still remember my college public speaking classes. It was one of the few courses that impacted me so much that I still use the material I learned today.
This class will stick with you.

A node is a computer you own that runs bitcoin software. It costs you a little bit in electricity and internet bandwidth but you help relay transactions, block invalid blocks, and preserves the integrity of the bitcoin block chain.
You are not a miner, so you do not generate huge electricity costs or make a profit. You would spin up a node if you believe in the bitcoin/blockchain technology or you feel strongly about a particular side in this bitcoin civil war (running CORE node software vs running B2X node software).
edit: I set my first bitcoin core node up 2 weeks ago, and have since installed another instance of bitcoin core on my roving laptop. If I wasn't using my Trezor as my wallet, I would probably use the bitcoin core node's wallet feature. It's really a "set it and forget it" process - super easy.

Kill the whole "I have to buy 1 BTC" misconception right off the bat so people will realize it's applicable to them and listen. You can buy fractions of a bitcoin at a time.

Laptop? Install it on your laptop and download the blockchain (automatically) while you're at work. It takes about 40 hours though.

Yo followers been doing that for 2000 years now! And they'll do it for another 2000 years.  
Mormons might the closest for actually predicting *something.* Their 7,000 year is set to start around 2033. (4000 years between fall of adam and christ's death, and we're almost 2000 years since then).
It's already predicted that AI/Cultural singularity is bound to happen around 2030-2045. I'm sure they'll spin it like "we told you some of these vague, bronze-age predictions would come true eventually!"

Not that I know of or can think of, probably for two reasons.
1. Your personal Bitcoin install will download/verify all the transactions and all the blocks before it can guarantee the authenticity of the block chain. If you download someone else's version of the block chain, you are trusting someone else.
2. The current block chain is over 200GB large, with most of the space dedicated to blocks within the last year. Blocks of ~1MB are added every 10 minutes. So if someone posts their block chain it will be out of date within a few mins.

Yes you can store coins of all supported denominations at the same time.

This is not a barter system. This is new money.  
And yes! You can create your very own coin and sell it - call it numadCoin. It might only trade for a couple of cents but if you market it well and people start talking about it and using it to buy things, then it will have actual value! You will have created new money out of nothing. That's the idea!  
AAntonop's youtube video also talks about this possible future. Thousands of alt coins will be created per day. Little timmy will create TimmyCoin and trade it with his fellow schoolfriends. SamanthaCoin will be created and used by a rival school child. Then a currency war will start similar to a popularity contest. Possible futures point to a world where currency is the new medium of expression.  
You remember how it was prohibitively expensive and difficult to print stuff, so it was out of reach unless you had a magazine or newpaper? Then the internet came around and everyday people became bloggers, podcasters, and youtube stars? Think that, but with monies.
