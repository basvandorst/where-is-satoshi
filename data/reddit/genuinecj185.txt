Wow, I didn't know this, thanks.  Last Spring/Summer I heard their bank didn't want to be involved if they used bitcoins.  Was that false or did I misunderstand?

Bitcoin is just a payment protocol.  Any "philosophies" behind it are subjective and while it does attempt to fix many of the problems with modern fiat currencies - using the word "cents" is not one of them.

With $.10 as the smallest value accorded to the smallest unit of Bitcoin the total value of all Bitcoins would equal $2.1*10^16 or $2.1 quadrillion.  The eventual need of more decimal place is not a known fact at this time.

Satashi's aren't used yet, so we can change its meaning.

"Bit" is a very general term.  I could spend a "bit" of anything - its criticism as an overloaded word comes from the fact that it means so little.  "Bit" was just someone's idea and wasn't neccesarily good, but just better than anything else that had been thought of.  And Satoshis being the smallest unit is a very old idea and became engrained in people's minds, but it was never officially accepted - just continually repeated.  
In addition, the smallest unit of Bitcoin will rarely be used as we'll refer to it by the "whole" unit which in that case would be a bit - which certainly doesn't sound like a whole unit.  Another criticism.  And if we did use the smallest unit as a whole unit we would need smaller units to break it up - what will we name those? Cents?  If so we'd have Bits, Satoshis, and Cents: the very idea I propose here except we have "Bits" which would not be used in this case.  We'd use 100 Satoshis.

Its established in people's minds, but I'm not charged Satoshis when I buy something and I'm not quoted a price in Satoshis when I trade them - nor will I be for the same reason that Starbucks doesn't charge me 535 cents when I purchase coffee: its a fractional unit.
The name of the fractional unit is not important.  "Cent" for example doesn't come from "Dollar" and there would be negligible effects if the US government decided to change it to something else.  It means 1/100th of something.  My use of cent is not important because its not going to be used when the "whole" can be used instead.  It's simply easy.
We use dollars, euros, yen, renmimbi, rubles, etc. becuase they are the whole unit.  Bitcoin's important "whole" unit can certainly stay "bit" and Bitcoin's fractional unit can certainly stay "Satoshi", but to give the important name Satoshi to the fractional unit will sideline it.
Even a simple reversal of "bit" and "Satoshi" would be a useful improvement as "bit" would be less used and the name directly implying Bitcoin, Satoshi, would be the used unit of account and trade.
My proposal ensures that we really do transact in Satoshis - which I would like to see.
