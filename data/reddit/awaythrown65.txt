I didnt mean to blame bitcoin, but I see that now.  I just never set foot in casinos or played games of chance prior.  After having bitcoin I found the world of online sports betting and dice in particular.  It only opened up the world to me, and I am struggling with the possibility that I may have a problem with something I only discovered weeks ago.
And thats the thing right... the house will always win, I will not win back what I lost and should be grateful I have what I do.

Coincidentally bitcoin also pointed out my problem with chemical substances via the silk road.  Kept the bitcoin, ditched the drugs.

Easier said than done I guess.   I had seen this over and over again.  I even know the odds are against me.  Yet a couple wins and my brain checks out.  Something else tells me, with a system you can beat these fuckers and make money easy.

Thanks.  I guess I am posting to hear what I already suspect. I have seen similar posts to mine on here over the years, and never thought I would be making one myself.

Im certainly at the "more than a game" stage at the moment.  I convinced myself I had a system that would beat the odds. I really got into the 2x W/L of 49.50%.  I reasoned that after a string of losses betting big made sense because, surely, a chain of 8 x &lt;49.50 would break on the 9th roll.  I even knew that is not how statistics work, yet I convince myself somehow.  
Thanks for your response.
