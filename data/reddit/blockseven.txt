Alex Jones is a dodgy character, he has consistently blocked evidence of tv fakery on 9/11, while claiming to be a vanguard of the truth movement...his silence on bitcoin is probably because it wasn't on his 'agenda' and even though he is now accepting bitcoin he will probably continue to be 'suspicious' of it...
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:04:27
will we see 'colored-coin' exchanges next?

they said litecoin wouldn't be replaced, but it's sinking because there is no innovation, you can downvote this all you like but it's true. Some people actually do want to invest in the latest emerging technology

@_date: 2015-05-22 12:55:56

At first I was optimistic about him, he says he a left-libertarian, which is odd. He seemed to be open to bitcoin in his q&amp;a with Andreas but listening to him recently I am suspicious..the whole thing looks like a big show.
