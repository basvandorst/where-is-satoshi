Also doesn't work in Ireland. Their customer service confirmed to me they will be rolling out to other countries in due course

From what I've read today, I don't believe the document is written to the chain. More like the existence of the document. So I don't think it can be used that way, thankfully.
Edit: this comment seems to confirm it-

I would assume (yet again) if several financial institutions have reliance on the blockchain it would be in their interest to throw some money at it and ensure its stability. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:47:09
Interesting you anticipate that. It is certainly progress anyway. Assuming the size of the blockchain isn't detrimental to its stability. If this takes off, I assume there would be several magnitudes of transactions than there would have been otherwise. Lots of noise on the blockchain .

Some people deem it easier and / or safer buying them this way. They are willing to pay a premium as a result. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:51:52
Done 
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:38:48
Much better, should be the default 
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:14:53
Number 4. More people need to do this

Am I correct in saying that since they trade a nominal amount of BTC per share(s) traded, they would only need a couple of hundreds dollars worth of BTC at most to complete the testing? 
@_date: 2015-01-29 20:17:42
I used tradewave before they implemented this.
I soon realised I knew nothing about Python and even less about trading algos but I loved it and their support is great!

Isn't the main benefit having a unique identifier on your phone? They don't want to make money for the end user, they want to provide a means of secure online transactions with device verification. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:45:35
Where do you live? They may apply a risk based approach when requesting documents. If you live outside a FATF country, it could be additional documents and/or certified originals.
Their service may be slow but you're best to accommodate their requests ASAP and just close your account when complete. Having said that, they will only give you the money when verified so you might as well complete the setup and continue to use them.
That's my take.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:39:57
They certainly don't buy on a bitcoin exchange either
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:40:54
☺ not exactly seekers but there's no risk free solution. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 08:12:09
So I'm new to all this but would increasing the block size to 2mb or more not make these issues go away?
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:20:10
OK, so we have your understanding on money laundering.
I'm struggling to think outside the box on this
Taking that definition, what did say that was inaccurate? This isn't an attack, I'm just unsure of what your overall point is.
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:15:34
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. 
I know this sub reckons you shouldn't have to provide docs and that's fine. Really has nothing to do with bitcoin though. A lot of exchanges want to be compliant with their jurisdictions regulations. Whether that's a bitcoin exchange or otherwise is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:16:19
Why don't you fill us in? 
Edit: downvotes for asking for clarification?!
@_date: 2015-07-05 19:53:23
Ireland also listed as part of the UK. It isn't 
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:46:39
I'm involved too. Hence the question. I would expect a source of funds check in line with standard AML policy but it doesn't go beyond the first source. You're suggesting the recipient needs to verify the first source and multiple prior to it. 
This would be a massive shift and burden. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 08:11:35
Are exchanges also going to be required to do historical transaction monitoring? 
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:05:35
I assume investors, retail and institutional, would be fearful of accepting any coins on the basis the funds, or their account, is blocked due to historical transactions. 
That would potentially outweigh any benefits in terms of speed, cost, security etc that are associated with Bitcoin. 
It's an interesting discussion and I hope to get involved with the company I work for. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 12:37:40
Source? 
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:49:40
Because they can't purchase on a non regulated exchange
@_date: 2015-04-09 21:40:48
Mind me asking what your profession is? 
@_date: 2015-04-29 20:10:40
They are paying for buying through a regulated entity. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:25:03
Why does it baffle you?
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:24:58
OK, don't hate me for asking, I've done no research... Do you make money on those? Is it commission per transaction or fx against fiat? Or is it all free? I've no idea... 
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:50:42
Doubt it. The technology they want to leverage is the network and cost not the mining reward. They will have a significant issue with convincing institutions to invest in this technology. For the institution, it doesn't add value for them. Current process works just fine in their eyes. 
Swift having been trying to move to swift mx over the last number of years and even with supposed hard deadlines, institutions have been slow to adopt. Again, the cost to upgrade isn't seen as worthwhile. If it isn't broke, don't fix it. That's the attitude. 
I work in financial services and I can see the benefits of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 21:47:54
I'll just leave this here 
@_date: 2015-03-04 18:56:47
I believe the ETF allows institutional investors, whereas the GBTC pink sheets are for accredited investors (that earn 200k per year or hold over 1 mil in assets). Someone more knowledgable will probably correct me :)
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:40:49
I'll edit now, I should be clear up front, I don't expect this to be presented to anyone in a senior position so I don't want to put people out. If I don't get anything, it's not a problem! 
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:59:43
We have bitcoin and institutions have swift. I can understand swift wanting to leverage some of the tech but again,  there's not enough benefit to the institutions to develop new tech for a new standard. Everything is fine in the eyes of financial services. 
A change can occur if something, such as bitcoin, is disruptive enough to the sector. I don't see that happening. I think bitcoin has its own place and will be several orders of magnitude more successful than it is now but it's not replacing anything for these corporations. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:10:02
The risk is that bitcoin could theoretically go to an infinite price so your loss would be infinite. 
If you went long, ie expected btc to rise in value, your loss can only be what was put into the trade if btc went to zero. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:30:20
1630.33 BTC = 1 USD. Better?

Banks currently see this as a bad thing. Some may want to adopt the technology but regulations are very much against a lot of what bitcoin has to offer. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:13:29
That's not very nice
