The solution should not just support payment of fines, it should also support payment of parking meter fees.
Here's how it could work.  You register your vehicle registration sticker with the app.  When you park, you open the app, and it tells you what the meter rate is at your location, what hours the meter is enforced, and whether there are any other restrictions.  Parking in NYC can be complicated, so the app can make sure you don't inadvertently violate a parking restriction that you didn't see posted.
With one tap, you select the amount of time you need to park, and the app sends the payment.  There's no need to drop coins in a meter, or swipe a card at a kiosk and post the receipt on the dash.  When parking enforcement checks your vehicle, they scan your registration sticker and are immediately alerted to your meter payment.
If you're away from your vehicle longer than you expected, you just open the app and make another payment to extend your time.  In fact, the app should alert you that your time is about to expire.  You could even set it to extend your time automatically when necessary.
OK, who wants to go into business with me?
EDIT: [Pango]( beat me to it.  They enable paying for street parking with a mobile app, including the ability to extend a parking session remotely.  They do not yet offer this feature in NYC though.  They should respond to NYC's RFI.  They could add parking fine payment to their app.

I would like to see an ad that illustrates some of the drawbacks of using credit/debit cards, then concludes with a scene showing the ease of a bitcoin transaction.
Some drawbacks include calling customer service before travelling in order to inform them of your itinerary so that your transactions won't be flagged as fraudulent, getting charged 3% foreign transaction fees (I got new cards after this happened to me a few years ago, but many people actually pay these exorbitant fees!), and spending hours modifying all your automated payments when your credit card issuer changes your card number after fraudulent activity has occurred.
* Resubmitting automated bill payments after a fraud incident: 90 min.
* Informing your banks of your itinerary before travelling: 45 min.
* Complaining to your bank about the $120 in foreign transaction fees after a trip: 15 min.
* [Paying]( for dinner at [Le Picotin]( (Paris) with no ID, no hassle, no fees: priceless!
* Using credit cards can result in wasted time, inconvenience, and exorbitant fees.  For everything else, there's Bitcoin.
By the way, I haven't been there, but [Le Picotin]( looks like a really good restaurant.

There are a number of restaurants that I frequent that refuse to accept credit cards.  (This is especially common among Japanese restaurants.)

I agree.  However, as I understand it,  MasterCard is not a lender.  Banks issue credit cards.  Banks make the loans.  MasterCard provides the infrastructure that allows consumers to access their line of credit.
If the world switches to using bitcoin, then banks will no longer need MasterCard's infrastructure to complete payments.  The bitcoin network is open.  Each bank can release a smartphone app that allows their customers instant access to a line of credit.
Merchants no longer need to have a relationship with MasterCard or one of the other big payment networks.  They just need to be able to receive bitcoin payments.
MasterCard is screwed.

The next feature I'd like to see in a restaurant POS system is the ability to pay from my seat with my smart phone, without having to flag down a waiter and wait for the check to be delivered.  Sometimes it takes over twenty minutes for a waiter to go back and forth with the check!  Whenever I'm ready to go, I should be able to review the charges on my phone, press the "Pay" button, get up, and walk out.  If I can do that with bitcoin, so much the better.
I know OpenTable is piloting such a service with a few restaurants, but an OpenTable reservation should not be required.  Every restaurant should offer this to every customer.
To take it a bit further, I'd like to see a menu and place my order on my phone.  If I need another glass of wine half-way through the meal, I should be able to tap my phone and have it appear on my table moments later.  I shouldn't really need to talk to a waiter the whole time I'm there :)

I think the reason NASDAQ is needed is to allow stocks to trade for USD.  I imagine the way their system will work is that NASDAQ will create the colored coins representing shares.  Parties who wish to purchase shares will need to deposit USD with NASDAQ (or an affiliated financial institution), for which they will receive colored coins representing dollars.  They can then create transactions exchanging dollar coins for share coins.
If companies issue their own share coins, and people trade them for BTC, then NASDAQ is no longer needed (ignoring limits on transactions per second).

Fortunately, I had brought a couple hundred dollars in cash with me, and I ran across some American tourists who sold me some pesos, so I was able to pay for the taxi ride into the city.

This is not actually his site.  It belongs to Reddit.  Under current Reddit policies, there is no way to remove him from his position of control over this subreddit, but that does not mean it could never happen, and it is not correct to say that is his property.
Maybe a productive way to proceed would be to attempt to persuade Reddit that there needs to be a way to force a moderation change when a subreddit's community is dissatisfied with the current moderation.

Actually, no.  It would only means they've lost the debate over block size.  But if Core were modified to support the new block size consensus, then it would have a very good chance of being the most widely adopted implementation, and core developers could retain control over other features.

This seems to be a common misconception.  If the XT block size policy were adopted, it would not give influence to anyone.  Bitcoin XT can always be forked, or the XT block size policy could be added to any other version of the bitcoin software, including Core.

If the large block proponents win the block size debate, it does not mean that they have won permanent control over the software.  Whatever block size limit ultimately gains consensus could be coded into Bitcoin Core, and then mining pools and all other users that don't like some features included in the Software That Shall Not Be Named will be able to switch back to Bitcoin Core.

Let's require proof of storage on transactions.
Assuming that a suitable proof of storage function can be designed, one way to use it would be to require proof of storage to be included in the mining process.  Another option is to require proof of storage on transactions.  Users running nodes would be able to stamp their own transactions with proof of storage.  Users running SPV clients would need assistance from a node in order to generate a valid transaction, and presumably nodes would offer this service in exchange for fees.
Here's an idea of how this could work.  A user assembles an unsigned transaction, where the value of the inputs exceeds the value of the outputs by the sum of the current mining fee plus a proof of storage fee.  The unsigned transaction is then sent to a node, which adds an output to the transaction that pays the proof of storage fee to its own address, and appends the current height of the blockchain.  The hash of the new transaction and the height are the inputs to the proof of storage function.  The result is appended to the transaction, which is returned to the user, and the user now signs this final version of the transaction.  This transaction is valid if included in a block no more than, say, 500 blocks away from the height included in the transaction.
A suitable proof of storage function should depend on the data in the pruned blockchain, and should be something that can be quickly calculated by someone who has that data, after having prepared appropriate data structures.
While requiring proof of storage to be included in the mining process would result in nodes being run in mining data centers, requiring proof of storage on transactions may result in a broader, global distribution of nodes.
@_date: 2015-08-13 18:16:02
Cuba is OK?
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:34:14
Because the transaction is signed after the proof of storage fee address has been included, it is the user's choice which node operator earns the fee, and miners can't interfere with that.  I agree with you about the overhead.
I don't think many people are reading this thread now, so maybe I should bring the idea up in another forum.
@_date: 2016-02-02 19:51:57
I mean that when the transaction is being mined, the miner will only consider it to be valid and include it in the next block if the proof of storage is obtained from a recent state of the blockchain.  This is to prevent someone from stamping their transaction with proof of storage derived from the blockchain as it existed three years ago; they are required to store a current version of the blockchain.
But I get the feeling something else was unclear about my post.  The idea is that when I send a transaction, I need to include proof that I myself am storing the entire pruned blockchain, or I need to obtain that proof from someone else who is running a node, and for this I pay a fee.  It's a way for a portion of transaction fees to be directed to people running nodes, not just to miners.

I looked up the definition of Money Services Business, to find out exactly how much bitcoin I can trade before I need to get a license.  The complete regulatory definition of "money services business" is [given by 31 CFR 1010.100(ff).](
There are several categories, but the only ones that seem like they might apply to trading bitcoin are (1) Dealer in foreign exchange and (5) Money transmitter.  However, the foreign exchange category specifies "instruments denominated in the currency of one or more countries", so this wouldn't apply to bitcoin.  The section on money transmitter specifies accepting from one person and transmission to "another location or person".  A face-to-face cash trade with a single person does not seem to meet this requirement.
So, looking at the definition, I fail to see how conducting face-to-face cash bitcoin trades, even for thousands of dollars, makes makes someone a Money Services Business.  If anyone can point me to a law or regulation that makes it illegal to trade bitcoin, I'd be interested to see it.

I guess what I'm missing is how the existence of an issuer that will redeem a unit of a fiat currency at face value gives the fiat currency an advantage over bitcoin.  The one benefit I can think of is that when a note becomes worn out, it can be exchanged for a crisp new note.  But bitcoins don't wear out.
If the existence of an issuer is such a critical matter, then why not consider the bitcoin network itself to be the issuer?  If I control a 1 BTC in a wallet, then the bitcoin network allows me, at any time, to generate a transaction sending 1 BTC (minus transaction fees) to another wallet.  In other words, the bitcoin network allows me to redeem 1 BTC at face value.
Furthermore, upon reading Tymoigne's article [The Fair Price of a Bitcoin is Zero]( I believe he made a crucial mistake in claiming that bitcoin has infinite maturity.  If I had to wait forever to spend my bitcoin, then I would accept that it has infinite maturity.  However, since I can spend my bitcoin immediately, it is more fair to say that bitcoin has instantaneous maturity.  This changes the result of the analysis to show that the value of 1 BTC is in fact 1 BTC, not zero, which is the same result the we get for dollars, $1 = $1.  In both cases, it tells us that the value of the asset is its face value, but it tells nothing of its value relative to any other good.

One thing this bill would do is require anyone entering or leaving the country with over $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in their possession to report it by filling out a form and handing it to a Customs agent at the point of departure.
So if you're catching a flight out of the country, you have to track down a Customs agent and hand them a form declaring any Bitcoin you might have on your mobile wallet, if you're carrying over $10,000 worth.  Otherwise they have the right to confiscate all the Bitcoin in your mobile wallet.  This is going to be a royal pain in the ass!  Expect Customs officers to start demanding that travelers provide passcodes for their smartphones.
It's also totally pointless since anyone who does want to move Bitcoin out of the country can do so simply by sending a transaction.  There is no need to physically transport it over the border.
