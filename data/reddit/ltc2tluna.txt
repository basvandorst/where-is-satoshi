I am going through the same thing. It’s been more than 7 hours and still haven’t got my BTC. Good luck to us!

WRONG! Socialism is a system in which the GOVERNMENT controls EVERYTHING, because by doing so, it’s believed that equality in all aspects of life can be achieved for the general population. In other words, power is given to the government (a group of people) so that they can manage every aspect of EVERYONE’S lives, Healthcare, Education, means of production, TV, radio stations, etc and that way a more “equal” society can be achieved �� Don’t be naive, have you lived in Russia, Cuba, China, North Korea, Venezuela?! Cause if you did you’ll be fighting and hating communism until the day you die. Go live under a communist regime, pick one, and then come back and let’s talk about it.

Yeah sure, believe what you choose to believe. Socialism as an economic or political system is bs. Have you lived in a country where EVERYTHING is owned and controlled by the government, where EVERYTHING you hear, watch, or do is scrutinized and directed by the government? Well let me tell you, I have, and it was a nightmare. Go spend years living under a dictatorial/communist regimen, and I assure you you’ll change your mind about socialism. Oh and btw, you all can downvote me all you want, that still doesn’t change the fact that I am right, and that I DID live and experienced live under a communist regime, not like most of you defending socialism because you READ it’s good and equal and all that bs.

So you are saying one is better than the other?! ���� Oh Jesus!

That’s right brother. It’s easy to defend socialism when you have NEVER experienced it. Glad you made it out.
