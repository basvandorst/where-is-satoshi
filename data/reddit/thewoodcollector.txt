I buy rosewood quite a bit, i go through a lot of rosewood burl quite often, i usually get it from Brazil though, i would buy some from you if it was still green if you could get it.

Yeah yeah, i dont think it is much of a worry here. Now if i were posting in this thread would already have 500 comments from 2 people and their 250 sock puppet accounts all pertaining to something "wood". i am so glad that the bitcoin group has a much higher mentality than other coin communities.

I can make pretty much anything you can imagine, Message me on bitcointalk and we can work something out. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:11:44
No, its a DSLR camera. Nikon D5200. No option to charge and record at the same time, no way to charge it while the battery is still in it. 
Just want to make one thing clear here. NONE OF THIS IS TO SAVE MY "BUSINESS". My business on the forum is buying wood, and none of this idiocy has affected that. I could give to craps if a single person commissions a single art piece from the forum ever again. 80% of the people there are nothing more than scum with no life, no money, and no brains.
The only reason i am doing this is to prove a point. That there are entirely too many idiots in the bitcoin environment that run serious business people off with their idiot tactics. The forum is riddled with idiots with too much time on their hands and their public display of idiocy destroys the perception of what bitcoin is. Bitcointalk.org is like a playground for kids, and yet whenever you search for anything bitcoin on google, bitcointalk.org is usually the first place you find. For anybody even considering bitcoin as an option, no matter if they are a merchant like wal-mart, or a guy in Tiwan who sends money frequently out of the country and is tired of fee's. They are going to look into any aspect of it. Find bitcointalk.org and be left with the impression that its "kid money for techies" Most are out before they even have the chance to find that some people in the cryptoshphere have brains. The technology is the greatest development of the century and it is going to change the world. Yet, Bitcoin is becoming more of a joke and a social experiment gone wrong every day. When it finally dies, there will be nothing left but the kids that ruined it still screaming how its the greatest thing in the world. Sooner or later they will turn on each other and Bitcoin will just be that thing that launched the blockchain public ledger technology. 
Thank god the brains of the community realized a long time ago that the future was in the technology behind bitcoin, not bitcoin itself.

No i told you already that it gave me an error message. Maybe tomorrow if you have a working link. I have to get back to work and get some more video done. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:35:17
I wasnt arguing that live streaming wouldnt bring visitors. I was saying that the trolls cant tune in right now as the forum is down and i have no way of even letting them know that i am streaming. So i am making video so when the forum comes back up i can post it. We both know, the minute the forum is online, they are going to be right back at it again. Most likely yourself included. Trolls are going to troll no matter what proof is slapped in their face. 50% of them are old fat guys most likely on disability or SSI who have nothing but time to sit behind a computer all day long and find ways to try and make peoples day difficult when they come to places like a forum to discuss real matters. Hell, for 1 bitcoin i could hire a dozen of them for a day. We already know that happens, we have seen it a hundred times on the forum already. 
None the less, if you want to hang out on a skype video stream and watch yourself for a while, i am all for it. I am waiting for my battery to charge for my camera so i can start shooting video again. So i got some time.

Bitcoin is useful if its worth $0.01 usd each. 
Whoever misinformed all of you that bitcoin was an "investment tool" has only fooled you all into losing tons of money while the promoters got rich. Bitcoin is a lot of thing but an investment is not one of them. 
I transact in millions of dollars worth of bitcoin yearly. I am paid by clients in bitcoin, and purchase exotic wood in bitcoin. I hedge the risk of not converting BTC to Fiat for less than a day or two tops. @ 1 cent or 100 dollars, bitcoin is useful for many reasons.
1: i do not have to fill out pages upon pages of forms to explain why i am sending large sums of money to where ever i am purchasing wood from. 
2: no matter if i send $1.00 or $100,000 it only cost me pennies compared to the few hundred dollars it would cost to send $100,000 usd to most foreign countries.
3: by both accepting bitcoin and paying my suppliers from the forums in bitcoin i save tens of thousands of dollars in credit card fees MONTHLY
I could go on for hours but i think i have made my point. Bitcoin value has NOTHING to do with its usefulness, and whom ever convinced you that it does needs to be slapped. Bitcoin value only matters to the few thousand people who were dumb enough to believe that Bitcoin should be an investment tool. For the rest of us, the merchants, the shoppers, the day to day transacters. The price of bitcoin means nothing unless it were to drop $100 in an hour which is about as likely as DPR getting off scott free on his charges over the silk road case.

I dont have a youtube account. Well, didnt have a youtube account. With new accounts you can only upload 10 minute videos i just found out. My DSLR camcorder records 20 minutes of video at a time. I'm more focused on getting video made than editing it down to 10 minute blocks. Find me a site that will let me upload like an hour of video at a time and within the next few hours i can get you what i have for video.
I wasnt joking when i said it takes sometimes 130 hours to finish a piece, you are going to have a LOAD of video to watch since everybody is against time-lapse. 
I dont expect an apology yet with the video i have thus far as once you watch enough of it you will see my methodology to make it "Better than a CNC" is quite the process. But when i am done with enough over the next day or so, and it is far better than a cnc, or was it laser? i will be expecting an apology from you.
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:51:13
Rather hard to be a final nail in a coffin when at no time did i ever say that i didnt use some stock images. As a matter of fact i have already said outright that i have? Is that really suppose to be your smoking gun? You are going to have to do better than that little boy!!!
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:09:13
Yep sure is. Got something smart to say about it now? Dont make me go homophobic on you :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:04:31
As soon as Bitcointalk.org is back online. You are going to owe me a serious apology. OR you can show me what a real child you really are and not be man enough to admit when you made a mistake. I dont expect you to bow down to me when i prove you wrong, i already know i'm that good. I just want a simple "I'm sorry, i made a mistake" from you and i will be quite content. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:31:33
I already did one of those patterns on a coin. Are you saying you want me to do another and make a video of it? If so, your paying for it. I'm not your trained monkey little boy. The circus act here is you and your fellow misfits and forum degenerates. I dont jump through hoops on command, not without someone shelling out some serious money for it. The forum is getting their video, maybe a few "how-to's" if there are enough people on the forum who want to learn a little about wood carving. Then thats the end of it. You miss the part where i could give a rip about you and your degenerate friends opinions. Not a darn thing you are doing is affecting my business. I came to the forum to buy wood from forum members, and i am still doing that every day. Selling wooden pieces is something the forum members asked me to do, not a business where i expect to make money and get rich. I never cared to sell a single piece on the forum. About all that any of you has accomplished here is wasted about 3 days showing how ignorant you can be and how little of a real life you have as you can sit behind a computer for days on end non stop writing garbage conspiracy theory's then using smoke and mirrors trying to get people to believe that a darn word you say is true. And in a few hours, maybe a few days if the forum ever gets back online, i will be the one putting nails in coffins, going about my business then leaving you degenerates to carry on with your next round of conspiracy.  
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:19:15
You cant really believe that do you? If you do than i have nothing more to say, time has taught me that arguing with someone with diluted perspectives is an exercise in futility and a waste of time.
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:49:09
I said longer than 20 Min. Goes to show you really do not read things before you let your fingers vomit on the keyboard. Not shorter. 60-100 hours of video 20 minutes at a time is bad enough, you really think i am going to do it 10 minutes at a time?
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:31:10
Was able to get the issue resolved it looks like, we will know tomorrow if they payments process automatically. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:36:30
Confirmed? what planet are you from? i have yet to see confirmation of anything. A ton of wild speculation sure. A bunch of smoke and mirrors, some pretty wild conspiracy theory's, and a ton of degenerates in a competition for virtual popularity. Got all that. But 0 confirmation yet. Do i need to ship you out a dictionary? 
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:45:16
Awwww, did the angry mob flood so much garbage onto the forum they broke it?

@_date: 2015-01-22 23:38:05
Come clean? Ha! Still on the CNC bit huh? Man your going to regret that one. Well probably not, your obviously too dumb to know when you have been burned.
X-Acto knife? where the hell did you get that from? Are we just pulling things out of our butts now? I never said that. Not once. I use wood carving chisels, and a rotary tool.
Anyways, there is nothing to "come clean" about there little man. I can see that trying to reason with you is nothing more than an exercise in futility for sure now. Although i will be owed an apology from you and your fellow band of kids, i can see now that you are going to go the route of smoke and mirrors rather than man up and admit you were wrong. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:03:26
100-130 hours of streaming? That isnt going to help much with the trolls. The forum is down so i couldnt even let them know. Hence the video. If you have skype and dont mind sharing your skype name in a private message i have no issue with taking the laptop down to my workspace and letting you watch on a skype video steam. The battery just died in my camera, so i am taking a quick break. But if i stream it to you on skype, i still expect an apology.

For the same reason that you lose your deposit when buying a house if you do not come through with the funds to buy the house. A deposit is meant to protect merchants from people wasting their time when they could have sold something to someone else. Its not a $10 toy, its a $2,000 hand carved piece that takes on average of a month to make. His $200 was a deposit paid because i had a lot of other people who wanted to commission  and i told him i wasn't holding it for anybody. First come first serve. He convinced me to take a NON-REFUNDABLE deposit and then wait until friday when he could get the rest of the funds. Meaning forced me to wait when i had people that would have and could have and wanted to pay for it right then and there, they were just after him in line and i went right down the list from top to bottom. 
Since you know i am about to start posting videos, and probably start streaming if the forums get up any time soon which is what was requested, is this the new angle you want to go with your witch hunt campaign? Better get nubbins over here to lend you a hand !
Just goes to prove this is a witch hunt, not concern over how my art is made. You guys are pathetic. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:19:28
Didnt read the whole thing, in the middle of making a video to shut all you clowns up :)
Yep, All HAND CARVED. NO LASER, NO CNC. 
I NEVER SAID THAT IT WAS FROM MY OWN MIND, I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT I USED STOCK IMAGES ON SOME OF THE PIECES. that is not a crime, i own the rights to them. 70% of your metal coins on the forum have stock image elements on them. Better start a dozen more witch hunts.
I didnt state anywhere that they were CNC'ed because THEY ARE NOT!!!!
Sure you can buy over priced pen blanks and low grade imported lumber on e-bay. You can buy a ferrari on E-bay too. To get high grade, actually the highest grade wood available your going to pay for it, and your not going to find it on e-bay. Well not frequently because woodworkers go to ebay for cheap stuff because most of them cannot afford the high grade wood. Its no different than sports cars. A porsche is a porsche, same name. But a Boxter S is a $30,000 car. A Cayman R will cost you $150,000.
BG, i got to be real with you man. I am having a seriously hard time believing that you are as dumb, blind, and naive as you are making yourself out to be. I looked through your post history on the forum and you did not appear to be such a stupid individual. So now its your turn to be honest with me. Is it just that you got bored with your day and decided to join in on a witch hunt throwing logic and sense to the wind? Are you just shopping for popularity points with the clique of eternal morons on the forum? Are you just trying to be entertaining and show the forum members that you can be dumb and funny like them too? Or do you really, seriously believe half the crap that you have posted to be true? I was under the impression that you were smart enough to know that 2+2=4. But you want to tell the world that 2+2=4 like it's ammo in a witch hunt when they guy your hunting already told you that 2+2=4. 
I already said i used stock image elements in the designs, i never said otherwise, and never denied it. You think that ranting on about it is damaging? it only makes you look like an idiot to people with brains, sure you look cool to your band of misfits friends, but who needs friends like that. You keep on with the, "its lasered, It's CNC'ed" B.S.  I have already said i was making a video showing otherwise and you still keep on with it... How dumb are you going to look when i post that video when the forum comes back online? VERY, VERY DUMB. The only Hoax here is the smoke screen of lies that you and your clique are spreading around to try and hide the facts, and as soon as i post the video's the mirrors you will use to try and keep it hidden, or the next smoke screen you want to ploy as to how my hands are really machines or robotic arms, you guys are really reaching on some of that crap, so i would not be surprised.
Seriously, when did you get so dumb? This seems to be a recent development as i can see clearly that it never use to be that way. Or is this really nubbins who bought some old accounts?
@_date: 2015-01-23 02:06:58
What disturbs me is that you probably believe most of what you just typed. i guess i would rather be a sociopath than a pathological liar, it has to be hard to convince yourself that half the crap you say is true.

If/When bitcoin levels off around $100-$150 will we really need it? I am perfectly happy using the .00 system. @ $100 a family dinner will cost about 0.6 bitcoin, why do we need a smaller denomination?

“Arguing with anonymous strangers on the Internet is a sucker's game because they almost always turn out to be—or to be indistinguishable from—self-righteous sixteen-year-olds possessing infinite amounts of free time.” 
.... But i am sure someone with infinite amounts of free time too will come around soon to argue with you. Maybe you two can have a play date. 
Lucky for me CryptoThrift has escrow, and thanks to you linking the threads everyone can clearly see that nobody had anything stolen from them and that your "scam accusation" is nothing more than a temper tantrum just like it was on Bitcointalk. No victim = No scam.
