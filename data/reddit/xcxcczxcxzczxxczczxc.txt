The Chinese government tries to ban outside non-censored internet, citizens with a little know how get around it easily.
You can't ban bitcoin.  Banks could stop letting you use your own money to purchase bitcoins from places like Gemini or coinbase, but that still doesn't "ban" bitcoin. You can buy them from other people, withdraw cash from banks and localbitcoins.com
Your complete focus, before buying a satoshi, should be learning how to properly secure your bitcoins.  Unless you want to invest in GBTC and pay a premium, it is imperative that you learn security before buying.

It has to be adopted by other people for it to have worth. 
 I am waiting on other people.  Vast majority of people haven't a clue what bitcoin is, other than it being used for criminal purposes. We are still in the very early stages of bitcoin.  Many people will never be able  to understand crypto. However, there hopefully will be a day where people use bitcoin without needing to fully understand it, much like people use fiat today. Bitcoin banks, bitcoin loans, bitcoin wages
In the meantime I have a majority fiat portfolio that shrinks more and more as the years pass.  Putting everything you have into crypto right now is extremely risky/extremely rewarding.
