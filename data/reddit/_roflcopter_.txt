The difference is pretty significant. It's 10%. If you bought 1 BTC at the time, that fee has now grown into a difference in your holdings of $975.

How did you have your stop set? If it is set as a stop limit and there's someone coming in willing to sell under you then they'll get filled first and if it's below your limit then your order isn't going to get filled. Stop losses are generally shitty tools that aren't well understood by most people who use them.
If you have a stop set at 8200 with a limit price set at 8150 and the volatility is high or someone dumps a lot of shares there is a good chance you won't get filled. Need to set it well below to cover something like a dump, whereas if you set it closer it will cover gradual decreases.

You owe 30% of the 20k gains for the 2017 tax year. You then have losses in the 2018 tax year that you can use to offset capital gains for the 2018 tax year. That 3k number that gets thrown around is the amount of carried forward capital losses that you can use to offset your income.
In this case, the person would owe the 6k this year and need to pay it. You can try to do things like get your taxes deferred for a year or set up a payment plan, but in most cases that's a payment you owe. 
What has essentially happened is that you have a 4 month tax free loan from the government while you wait to file your return. When you threw that in alt coins and lost it you were losing money that you owed to the government. 
edit: misspoke about carry forward losses.

Yep, my bad. I didn't read what I wrote.

You don't need to cash out everything, you should know your tax debt (which if you're constantly jumping in and out of alts will be your account value change * your marginal tax rate -- because it is taxed as income) and sell off whatever you need to in order to pay your taxes. You can keep trading it if you want but you need to realize that you don't own that money anymore so if it crashes you will be a little bit fucked.
I'm not saying that US cap gains system is fair: short vs long term rates is stupid imo. It just is what it is and you need to be aware of your tax situation so that you don't end up with a nasty surprise when you file.

The article isn't written by ZeroHedge, it's written by The ICO Journal which only posts bullish stories -- just hosted on ZeroHedge. I wouldn't give this too much weight: bullish author, CFTC source who has no input into SEC decisions, and a former SEC employee who is much less optimistic than the CFTC source.
Really not sure how this turns into "nearly certain" approval.

I still don't understand why when questioned on solid current use cases on bitcoin, people don't respond with currency exchange and money transfers. The ability to move millions of dollars near instantly across the globe for close to nothing is something that Kevin should at least understand.

I mean that's not the point. Kevin was making a claim that there was nothing you can do with it. We aren't at a point right now where it's better to make the jump through crypto to transfer fiat to someone (in your own currency or changing currencies), but if we get to a point of price stability and we get a more competitive marketplace that drives fees and spreads down it's not unforeseeable that it could be a better option than paying fees + house currency spread at your bank. 
I'm not claiming that this is the end goal of crypto, not by any means. Distributed ledger + blockchain technology for trustless transactions is game changing, but it sounds complicated and unless you have a receptive audience that is going to pay attention for five minutes it will always sound like a scam. When you're dealing with someone aggressively opposed to bitcoin that's screaming about a lack of applications of the technology, you need to retort with something they can understand -- even if it doesn't work perfectly or doesn't work perfectly yet. 
If you're preparing that interviewee for this segment and giving him ten questions, current applications of the tech is 100% going to be on that list. His response is pretty unacceptable. He may be smart, composed, and a decent spokesman for cryptocurrency, but his lack of preparation really comes through with the interview for me.
