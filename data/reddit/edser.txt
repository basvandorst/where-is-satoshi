BTC is horrible for use as money. It is not offline, not easy, confirmation times, etc etc.
It is a great ledger and storage device tho, which can be a backbone for something better as new money if that is an end goal.

there is code there, but not on the coin itself
the code links to a guy that has contributed to btcsuite
the company he lists himself under doesnt list him

I get the 'how it will work' comment. The issue is that these take forever to develop in these dev's spare time. This isn't a conglomerate that can crank out code with 50+ devs at 50+ hours a week.

since they are poor, what would be the plan to give them internet access on a whim to use btc to transact?

NEVER receive updates on its own. That is asking for serious trouble.

what if satoshi paid 100k btc to a time traveler for a generous code fix/advice/etc which is one of the many wallets sitting idle and he then comes back during ATH to dump?

With my many talks with Josh to fix an issue on their deplorable service as a simple vendor of gridseeds, I can tell you he plain says the people that wrote the site made typos or the information is just plain incorrect. Do you really then think they are capable of running a real business if they cannot relay simple facts and merch to customers?

don't need to be elite, you just need to watch the endpoints. your focus is on the wrong side of the transfers.

if you have root, on a linux machine, and dont know where to go from here, you should quit.

smells fishy.

They do not preserve your transaction, so they may consider this a loss and cancel. You got screwed like many of us. Left and have not regretted.

weird you got more hate than OP. Sex for money seems like win/win to me. Voluntary obviously.

maybe privacy, but not security. this isnt the private key.

they will never take you seriously.
if they have an interest in BTC in the future, they will just buy it out or make their own and force other corps onto their chain. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:50:18
that is possibly the weirdest reasoning ever. Having a QR code doesnt make you rich just as posting this doesnt make it less secure.

You would need either an offline wallet or another device, OR an online wallet. No need for another phone or computer per se. Easiest is online wallet on such as an exchange, blockchain.org or circle.com or something. the best is an offline generated wallet which is a piece of paper that you have to store securely. Send coins to this wallet to save for later.
This is quite over simplified in an explanation BTW

Depends on the skills you possess. Are you looking to just promote, or sell something to small businesses? Why not develop a plan for businesses to convert and do consulting for this?
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:50:39
why not buy it out? how do you win if you are a bank and dont want people to switch? you make it fail in price. buy it out, short it, dump to shit.
After a couple of years since BTC failed, they have made way more on failed companies and loans cause of the businesses surrounding BTC in the first place than they used to take a hit on killing BTC. 
Trump is worth more than all of BTC, and its not like he would go broke buying the mkt cap right now and hodling forever.

My vote is for Razor (RZR). The project manager has a clear focus on getting RZRoad finished. The incoming funding round will target the most needed and possibly most critical decentralized utility of the current web today. Built on Tor, with privacy in mind, running an unregulated system is imperative in keeping freedoms in the world today.
Built atop the Razor cryptocurrency and the Tor network, RazorRoad is designed to be the most advanced and secure anonymous online marketplace available today. Along with anonymity, RazorRoad will be built around the principle of decentralization, the most ingrained and venerated concept in today’s cryptocurrency community. By removing central points of failure from the marketplace, and decentralizing the marketplace through the power of the blockchain, RazorRoad and its user base will be effectively protected from government overreach and abuses of power. RazorRoad provides people with a simple, secure, and safe way to conduct business and commerce away from the reach of oppressive regimes, laws, and sanctions.

I dont see a coin/project/person mentioned here ?
I guess tho new to reddit and seeing the posts online are hard to decypher real from fake.
EDIT: post gone. for reference the post was about people faking votes on new accounts....
