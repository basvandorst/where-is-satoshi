Anyone that says he knows is full of BS. No one has conclusive evidence that Dorian is or is not Satoshi.

I don't think the article implies any one person, or even a group of people, lost billions. It is talking about the value of all Bitcoins in the circulation. A better job the writer could have done is to point out the percentage of active Bitcoin addresses, considering the unusually high proportion of Bitcoins that would likely remain untouched. That way one could better gauge how much pain the market actually felt from the plunge.

Honestly, I think this is pretty stupid. 2 of the most important factors in Newsweek's report is 1. Dorian's name was Satoshi, and it was official record, and 2. His response in his encounter with Leah. It's one thing that you don't agree with the report, being skeptical of the context of the encounter, other circumstantial evidence, like his writing styles, and his denial of it. We can do better to move the discussion forward, be it toward the unmasking of Satoshi, if you want, or the development of Bitcoin.

 Why so hostile? OP made a website and asked politely for opinions, I couldn't see any justification for your mean comments.

Bloomberg is one of the sources I trust with a very high confidence. Whether or not they have done a good job asking meaningful question, like "So if I request a cash withdrawal right now, when will I see it in my bank account?", is another question. The reporters might not have been aware of Mt.Gox's disappointing track record.

I ... I know some of these words.

That's probably from the currency converter of the iPhone App ZeroBlock. Not a proof in any way.

This is big news, and the outcome of the hearings may change how the average person perceives of Bitcoin.

Website works fine for me.
