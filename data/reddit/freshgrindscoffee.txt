eventually the people that pay ebay store fee's will use this service. 
i recommend the service "blksz" helped me get my store 24/7 
great price and even better support provided!
@_date: 2016-04-30 15:45:29
i purchased a vps for a year i believe it will take time for OB to grow. 
its a cheap enough investment ($22) to watch what comes from being online 24/7. 
plus you have the added bonus of having some great support from blksz if any issues were to happen.
now its just a matter of selling this service to people who can barley install wordpress that already own stores in the local neighborhoods.
