@_date: 2017-12-26 11:36:38
late night ,CET , someone bought huge amount of BTC,
price went up.
I think is used for speculations. Now the price will go down for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:12:42
this is pure manipulation. someone is just pumping the market.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:25:41
market manipulation
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:41:03
that's how stocks works. the guys with the big money dictates everything.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:40:32
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:52:43
in last 3 days someone bought the market, now the same guys are selling the market. 
Now, when we have BTC futures, this is easy possible.
Speculative games.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:16:02
no one sane, should have more then 1000$ in this game.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:54:51
dude, just look at movement from 12 hours ago. Someone is buying the market. it's not a normal movement. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:36:18
in 5 hours
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:55:16
someone is on the shopping spree
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:33:50
maybe on Playstation 2
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:20:54
fly coin fly.... tu tu du tuuu, to the sky
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:52:06
run my little coin, run
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:13:08
you never know
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:17:23
because they depend on BTC
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:17:28
for 50$ BTC transfer, you pay 38$ fee.
I think, that's fair, because for 12$ you can do a lot fun stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:46:10
why is it falling ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:59:53
I agree with you. 
Since 12 hours someone was buying everything, so the price went up.
I think also the idea is to pump and then dump.
But we will see soon.
Many wales in the market, just focusing on the profit. Be careful.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:09:36
was nice knowing you guys.
leave the ship now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:45:49

lol. true.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:48:08
300$ for 1 BTC is realistic and fair  price
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:10:03
And Mexico is gonna pay for it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:54:34
If bitcoin goes to 300$, I'll buy three pieces.
