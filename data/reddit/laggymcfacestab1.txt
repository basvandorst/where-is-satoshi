The spikes can be caused by a number of factors primarily hype with bitcoin but other factors cause spikes and dips in the same way any stock would.
i.e. a company has bad publicity its stocks drop it gets good publicity its stocks rise.
This is very basic understanding remember there are a lot of reasons for prices to vary with supply and demand being the main control.

Hype people not wanting to miss out everyone expected mass volatility in Bitcoin when in fact the price ended up slowly climbing up and being less volatile. 
This is all just my opinion of course and I’d like to hear some counter arguments but for me adding future trading to bitcoin just solidified that it is a serious contender and is here to stay.

One way I had it described to me was people taking out future contracts may do so in case of bitcoin crashing. This is especially good for miners who use electricity to pay to mine bitcoins if the price was to drop significantly they could take out a futures contract to make the drop less financially difficult on themselves like a kind of insurance

This is the time I use an exchange to pump all my altcoins into bitcoin then wait for the bull

I think potentially the markets are already reacting in some way to this - investors normally make their mind up prior to the decision being made. HODL
edit: forgot the HODL

Your address will change but old address will work - some people prefer to use a different receiving address for each transaction. When I was new to bitcoin I was worried I'd lost money because I used one of my old address'

I am also a long term crypto watcher and investor (I don’t have millions) my only scepticism is with forks and ICO’s if these continue I don’t understand how cryptos will ever be non volatile until there is a clear winner
I think we will continue to see short term investments moving between cryptos based on hype unfortunately. 
I also think whilst these exist people will
Be too scared with the premise that one day their coin might be worthless compared to new coin tech.
I am a firm believe bitcoin will overall be the crypto of choice but it may also end up being a novelty either way I think the trend will continue to rise.

love this Analogy!  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:35:33
what implication? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:45:34
The issue I find and I found this with my parents I keep hearing "I can't afford to invest $11,000" I think people still believe that to be in bitcoin and use the technology you must buy in whole numbers. I think the sooner the adoption of using satoshi's is accepted as the norm the better.

I’d find it easier to explain as the internet version of cash but without boarders with no middle men just peer to peer transactions - essentially you are your own Bank.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:48:00
If you kept your recovery keys yes just like Andreas Antonopoulos always says if you own the keys you own the bitcoin if you don't own the keys you don't own the bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:00:35
I think the first question to ask is does it work on any other PC/Laptop?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:36:11
I think for it to get to this value it would have to be globally adopted meaning other currencies would be worthless but by that point wouldn't people be buying and selling exclusively in BTC ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:53:58
If you are looking to long term HODL I would recommend a paper wallet - cold storage is perfect for long term HODLing print it off store it in safe.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:30:58
I would recommend Breadwallet very easy to use nice interface  - I have always been told to keep away from PC / Laptop OS as they are very heavily targeted with malware and use your phone OS as it is a much more secure OS.
I know you say you don't have many coins but they might be worth a lot in the future so best practices are always good - remember to keep your private keys safe (mine are wrote down and in a safe)

Currently the trade volume on bitcoin futures I read was near 60 million USD where as the day to day trades on bitcoin is over a billion so the futures currently have no real impact on BTC price but do bring it to mainstream attention
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:23:01
I personally don't think its too late I always believe we will hit 20k and I firmly believe we will reach back close to $19,000 very soon maybe today maybe over the next week. 
These are just my opinions and it is a gamble so do not listen to my word as gospel :) The altcoin you move into BTC could end up outperforming the gains of BTC but I see BTC as a less risk investment to some of the altcoins so anytime I see large gains in my alts and Bitcoin dips (I mean this in the loosest sense of all (a dip of 5% is nothing really for BTC)) I tend to move them into BTC for a slight protection and the hope that the bull run is good enough to earn a little bit of extra crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:01:07
I think potential short-term loss with long-term gains. I don't think they can regulate it like they want too and I think this will mean further spread adoption which is always a good thing.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:55:07
Nice explanation thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:51:22
I think that's why the adoption of trading in Satoshi's is so integral to keeping the price of 1 BTC so high - I saw a similar post yesterday where someone asked where the Bitcoins come out of the Bitcoin ATM's and what do they look like.
I have heavily invested in BTC for a while and whilst I love the idea of decentralized currency my biggest investment is in the blockchain technology. When companies begin to introduce the blockchain as there prefered method for using ledgers I will begin to invest in these companies rather than Bitcoin itself.

Dips are the best AKA bitcoin Christmas sale ! Good luck to you

Normally that is due to the fact people like to sell BItcoin in round numbers I.e a lot of people sell at 19,500 than at 19,425 so there are sell walls at round figures. Bitcoin futures doesn’t ever touch bitcoin it’s literally 2 people betting against each other that it will rise or fall I hope when CME opens trading the price will shoot up as it did last week with CBOE opening future trading.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:03:27
+1 to this so many people are storing coins in online wallets andreas has the best line for this “if you don’t own the keys you don’t own the bitcoins - you are back to a master slave relationship just like with the Bank” best advice I’ve had yet there is no point to crypto currency if you are storing it online. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:45:51
Why is everyone so unhelpful blah blah can’t be true who cares just answer the question - if it helps people today or in the future why does it matter
It’s a flat fee maybe add some more if you need to make it a priority if you are looking to cash out I wouldn’t recommended sending that amount all at once to One exchange.
Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:54:24
I think the question needs to be looked at in a different way - if Bitcoin carries on being popular and gaining more public momentum then there is no reason for it not to rise (It will have to rise in order for it to be adopted globally) I think you need to make a decision as to how much you can afford to lose and only invest this - with the hope that it gains more momentum which currently looks to be the case - remember this can all change very easily with so many factors at play.

Nice website pretty fun to look at - I think smaller items should be added for 0.01 and less nice job!
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:41:39
I found when mining another currency you could set a limit for example cash out at 0.002 automatically but you could change this amount (with the 0.002 being the minimum cash out) 
I would say look into the cost in detail prior to paying to mine to make sure it’s the best option you may find it better just buying coins. This isn’t me advising against it just making sure you know the full costs.

Isn’t ROI - radio on internet ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:32:48
I am not an expert but doesn’t the same happen with gold and oil and all commodities ? Thus increasing the value of the remaining items. As the price increases people take further steps to ensure no more will be lost.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:38:47
I would recommended using bread wallet been around for a long time and works really well.
Make sure you write your key / secret words down stick it in a safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:04:59
I would use something other than the native search I.e windows search and begin looking for common file names and words such as wallet* json* bitcoin * blockchain* backup* looking for early mining programs in the usual locations desktop documents downloads user profiles and application Data folders 
Good luck 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:29:02
It depends on technical knowledge 
I would recommend the following
* **Mastering Bitcoin** - More advanced for techies
* **The Internet of Money** - Less advanced but still very informative
Other recommended books
* **The Business Blockchain**: Promise, Practice, and Application of the Next Internet Technology
Which is excellent for understanding the mass applications of the Blockchain technology
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:45:10
well put each year apple and Samsung fight to release new features and the other one just copies the others idea - think the same will apply to Bitcoin it will integrate other coin's methods to improve whilst maintaining itself as the dominant cryptocurrency Bitcoin has one factor which will always make it prevail ... it was first and therefore it will always have the biggest following and media hype.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:13:56
very good for new users but not the most efficient way of gaining coins  - for most people trying to make money getting coins at the lowest value during dips. Coinbase charge fee's to buy and sell coins if you are day trading this eats your profits.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:19:55
I second this

�� classic what’s next you say bitcoin is dead 8k up in a month still by far the market leader and the only coin close to mainstream 
Lightning network gets implemented Bitcoin cash dies everyone comes crawling back but now bitcoin is 25k and all the BCH clan lose loads of money
The future is bright
