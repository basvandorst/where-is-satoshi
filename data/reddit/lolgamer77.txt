It's all about 6 California's so far... think they'll mention bitcoin?
Edit: and he's off, no mention

This post is only 16 minutes old but hopefully somebody comes in with a useful answer. It's a reasonable question. It's not going to happen for bitcoin but there are alt coins based on this premise

Interviewer: How do you keep these coins secure?

I agree. I'm just pointing out that we're going to start seeing QR codes posted on phone poles. Is that the kind of attention we're looking for?

I mean College GameDay is good media. Westboro Baptist Church putting QR codes on their protest signs is bad media. I'm kind of playing devil's advocate here, I also kind of agree with you that any publicity is good publicity. I also just realized that begging is banned from this sub. Soooo for the record I was trying to prove a point

Amidst a sea of down votes, I got a laugh hoorah

Maybe you're right. My initial reaction was that this is going to spark an annoying trend. I suppose people begging for bitcoin is better publicity than "you can buy drugs with it!"
