But they still don't want to release. Now its your Case.

Im not buying bch for fiat. I've just changed bitcoin cash to bitcoin.

Meanwhile the problem is, that I did everything what they requested what is possible.All the KYC and much more. But they still do not refund my coins. I did this swap in the exodus wallet, which you promote so badly. The Price on exodus is significant higher for the swap, but according to all the Stuff you wrote, that u assist the People and there aren't any Problems with 3th Parties and so on ive decided doing it in the exodus wallet. Yes probably you are using just a white label Service, but thousand of People trust you and you are doing money with this. You get at least 50% of the commission which coinswitch takes. I even think more. And now me, as a client, lost his Money - 6500 Euro. An I've spent already 10-12 Hours for providing them the documents and fight with them and trying to get my money back.  
The only thing what you are doing is copy pasting some Messages.

This isn't a Problem. There is nothing wrong with it.
The Problem is, that exodus is advertising something which is wrong.
+ Coinswitch requested a lot of Information and I did all what they wanted and they still do not release it. This is the only Problem with all of this. This are legal bought bch, somebody ask me if I can sell btc. So I've swapped the bch into btc. I was also able to proof to coinswitch where I've bought the bch.

I did all what they requested for in there first Message, everything!
But they keep my coins.
@_date: 2019-12-28 22:36:01
Update: I've provided much more Videos, Photos and Informations than ever needed by any KYC.  
Meanwhile Sebastian the COO from Exodus contacted my directly and is assisting me getting my Money from Coinswitch.
Coinswitch is not ready to release even when they have the full documentation, they will tell me "the decision" later.  
Dont ask me which decision, this is a coin swap of bch where I proved everything.

Can you not read? Its a swap from bitcoincash to bitcoin. I did all the KYC but they refuse to release the MONEY!
I did all the Shit including a video talking in front of the camera, showing my documents and a handwritten Paper!

Thanks Mate!

They get at least 50%, this is what CoinSwitch writes in there PDF for white label there service.

I've read a couple months ago that Exodus is not working anymore with coinswitch. So I've thought they have a good Solution. But you are right, wrong decision.

Everything turns out more and more interesting.
\- Meanwhile I did KYC - uploaded my Documents.
\- I sent a Proof from my [ Account where they exactly see the same bitcoin cash Amount transferring to the exodus wallet which ive later exchanged there.
\- I recorded a Video, with my Documents and a written Paper that I want to get my Money back.
They are still refusing to return my Money and want to see a Video out of my Account where I show them the transactions between me and People ive traded with. The funny thing is. You can't see any informations about the trades. Because after a Trade is closed there is no more information about the correspondence. The only thing which u can show is the Amount you bought. Which is exactly the same ive tried to swap on exodus. [
All the things which they mention 5 hours ago I did -&gt; [
They are requesting more and more things which are not possible. We are meanwhile way over a KYC.
@_date: 2019-12-31 09:49:18
I did the swap on Exodus, exodus is nowhere writing that they send the coins to coinswitch. The only thing which is exodus writing that there is no KYC.
@_date: 2019-12-28 15:05:41
You are wrong, they requested KYC and even more.  
Which I did meanwhile, also when I think its completely wrong to do it.
@_date: 2019-12-31 09:45:46
And? Is it a Secret? We also can speak in German, English, Russian.
You are a bright light.
