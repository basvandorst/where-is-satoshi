You probably didn't sell during the December bullrun eh?
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:47:27
Didn't make shit til you sell.

First it was high, then it was low.

You should read some of the stupid shit he did that got him caught. He's not that smart lol.

Keywords are important. By putting "Chinese" instead of "they", it becomes quite obvious:)

@_date: 2018-03-27 17:24:25
You mean sell?

His anus.

You must be a bit slow, made even more obvious by your aggression. The word "either" at the end of her sentence means she implied that neither bitcoin nor USD have intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:03:05
Or there could be people trying to sell and no one buying, so they lower their ask price, thus lowering the price of Bitcoin.

I mean if they took your debit card and went to an atm, but I suppose stealing BTC is a lot easier to get away with.

Mutual funds are garbage, riddled with fees. Read any investing book and you'll know. Stick with index funds and ETFs.

Uh, source please.

Yea cause rich people never manipulate things that allow them to become richer.

Why don't you think so? The technology is progressing faster every day.

I paid $15 to transfer $700 and it took about 4 days. Please tell me how this is superior to an international crypto transfer.

So you don't think robots will take all the jobs in the next 30 years?

You guys make it sound like every rich person has a high risk of being attacked with a wrench. It's not much different than someone beating you until you give up your PIN, and that doesn't happen often.
Edit: Ok guys I see your point, it's a lot easier to steal tons of money with crypto, you're right!
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:10:02
So much bullshit in the cryptosphere, I'm actually getting tired of it.
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:34:22
So you sold at $150 and not before that?
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:02:41
Dude just stop.

It's probably true though. I also find it really irritating when my family sends me sensationalist articles thinking I have no clue what's going on.
