it's delayed though, i haven't found real time anywhere except by paying

Ah...I hadn't seen the interview. I just saw the tweet that said they were working on it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:16:41
People saying "zoom out, it's fine" should actually zoom out. The chart does not look fine. People keep calling the 40% retraces between 1k and 20k bubbles. Those were just shakeouts within the bubble. I think people should be prepared for worst case senarios right now. I think we break long term support near 8k after a bounce and actually pop this mother. I'm talking 2 year bear market leading into the next halving. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm preparing myself mentally for this potential outcome.

They already said they are working on it. Can we stop the lynch mob? I know it's a little disappointing that it's not activated yet, but it's not like they came out and said naw we aren't gonna do segwit. They came out and said yeah, we are working in it. I'm fine with them taking some time to make sure it's all perfect and secure...we are talking about over 500 billion dollars here...there is no room for mistakes.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:20:56
volume should higher if we want a real rise
@_date: 2014-05-14 22:00:55
can someone give a step by step example of when/how this is useful? just looks like a setup for a scam to me...
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:56:15
if the only business you are doing from that account is with coinbase i'd say that's for sure a bit suspicious. i use my regular account and have never had any problems no matter the size/regularity of the transaction(s).

So much manipulation...how is this the first comment to point it out? How can this be good for bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:00:12
for pennies on the dollar...
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:43:54
at least someone it has their head on straight...
@_date: 2014-03-19 11:42:43
this comic is awful.
@_date: 2016-03-04 20:30:52
what's this do for the segWit in April time frame?
@_date: 2016-03-16 12:21:07
the web is pretty much useless without js.

Well if the traders all decided to dump their btc and dropped the price back down to $10 I don't think you'd be living very comfortably...so go ahead and claim price and traders don't matter, but in the end they 100% do.
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:59:33
Right after it breaks $1 million per coin.
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:33:22
Eh...that's not exactly fostering a positive image for bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:08:24
You are not a friendly person, and this guy is right. The common man is NOT going to manage their own keys. For bitcoin to succeed it needs to be stupidly easy, not technically easy. You are blinded by your ideology.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:52:36
They don't have to get used to shit buddy. They will just keep not using bitcoin and be totally happy about it. The problem bitcoin solves in it's current form isn't a problem that the general public has....so why would they bother using it at all?
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:12:29
I think bitcoiners overestimate how tech savvy the general public is...bitcoin needs the service layer or adoption will come to a halt.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:54:43
The general public isn't scared of banks. Bitcoin can't be a mainstream success simply because there is no bank involved. That scares more people away than it invites in. Think general public here. You can keep telling this story over and over, but the fact is people want convenience over security every time. If you think you can shift the entire zeitgeist of the world away from that go ahead and try, but I think a more pragmatic approach would be WAY more successful. That's why a service layer shouldn't be seen as the enemy, but a necessity. That doesn't mean you can't generate your own keys if you want, but fueling fear that you HAVE to or you will lose your bitcoin is not going to help the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:08:55
This is basically propaganda.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:46:43
We should just continue using Bitcoin. The high price is good and shows confidence in the tech. The Bitcoin name is powerful and recognized. mbtc has no ring and no recognition. Anyone interested in btc quickly learns you can buy it in fractions. It's not a major hurdle for people and it's not holding Bitcoin back. If we switch to anything it should be satoshis since that is an already widely recognized unit. Using the full unit or the smallest unit makes sense. Just like dollars and cents, there aren't any units between them marking 10 cents as mcents.

Coinbase said you will have access to both coins within 4 hours of the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:55:54
How? Enlighten me because I can't see past the first box.
@_date: 2017-04-04 16:51:12
Considering I was holding pure BTC at the time of the hack I don't really feel like I got paid back.
@_date: 2016-09-17 17:08:06
You can transfer money instantly and with no fees using PayPal.
@_date: 2016-09-24 16:24:07
Doesn't having transactions off the chain mean trusting a 3rd party? Isn't a large point of Bitcoin that you shouldn't have to do that? I'm not super knowledgeable so I could be wrong...but that's how I understand it...correct me if I'm wrong?
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:54:29
Technically spending btc is the same as selling btc and that means capital gains tax...someone correct me if I'm wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:22:30
Wouldn't I then have to pay taxes on the taxes I just paid because of capital gains?
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:41:21
Wouldn't someone just write a bot for that if it was a viable strategy?
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:39:22
My mistake. It's not yet implemented, but it's passed the house and senate from what I've read.

How does punching myself in the face make Arizona accepting Bitcoin irrelevant? The op implied that the US government would never accept Bitcoin, but that is clearly not the case.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:08:29
Arizona accepts Bitcoin to pay for taxes so it's not as outlandish as you may imagine. I don't know why you would since you'd get taxed for paying your taxes, but you can if you want.

I'm not sure about that...my sister's computer got some randsomware and she sent the bitcoin and got it unlocked, but to get it unlocked she had to send one of her encrypted files to them. I'm pretty sure they had a method of getting the decryption key based on the encrypted file she sent them. it was a shared address.

Psychological distress can be so severe that it results in suicide. By your logic a paper cut would hurt more, but how bad would that paper cut have to be before you'd kill yourself to make the pain go away?
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:37:35
Maybe take it up with the author? I didn't say anything about recourse anyway though. I merely pointed out that words can indeed hurt people and there are differing degrees of metal pain just like with physical pain.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:26:11
LOL 10,000 after the crash? I don't think it'll even break ATH this year.
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:50:18
Uh...btc dominance looks pretty weak these days to me...I'm not sure 50% will hold.
