Unlikely that he was mining Bitcoin on a PC in 2015-2016. It's possible he was into other coins though. I'd run a search for the wallet files like has been mentioned, but also search for any popular wallet software of the time like multibit or electrum. You could also check for things like Tor or mining software like nicehash. Also, if you could tell how many/what type of gpus he had in it (if any), that may lend credence to possibilities of his mining.

All you need is a wallet and post the address in a place visible to your customers. Setting the Bitcoin prices for your goods/service will be a bit difficult right now due to what other posters have said. However, it can be done, but you will have to factor in fluctuations in Bitcoin value and fees. You will also need to decide if you want to keep the Bitcoin or immediately cash it out for fiat.

What does it say in the top left corner?

Since at each halving less coins are entering circulation, shouldn't the line be growing at an accelerated rate? It looks more or less linear.

The way I understand it is that they price their items in fiat. Say your selling a widget for 1 dollar, you offer the option to pay that with an equivalent amount of btc, then immediately cash it back out into fiat. This works because of bitcoins nearly instant transaction speed.
